 Code 8731 (NAIC 54171) with employee size standard of 1000.
 The contract will include a 30% small business subcontracting
 requirement that includes a 5% women owned goal and a 5% small
 disadvantaged business goal (both 5% goals may be met by a
 single firm.) In anticipation of the final Request for Proposal
 (RFP) release early October, the Air Force Air Armament Center
 (AAC) at Eglin AFB (AAC/PKZ) will be holding a Pre-Proposal
 Conference for prospective TEAS 4 offerors on September 21,
 2000 from 1300 - 1500. Conference location is AAC Headquarters,
 Building 1, 101 West D Ave, Room 204, Eglin AFB FL. Check-in
 and registration will take place outside the conference room
 at 1230. Each company is limited to three attendees. Up to

 All appointments are in 15 minute increments with a maximum
 of 7 individuals in attendance. Please contact Ms. David for
 an appointment. The current TEAS contract F08626-96-D-0003
 is scheduled to end 10 Jun 01. The estimated ceiling level
 of performance is 875 man-years per contract year (1764 hours/man-year),
 and most likely is 530 man-years per contract year. The contract
 will include a minimum quantity to be ordered in the first
 year. That minimum will either be 135 man-years or more, TBD.

 INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THERI
 OWN COPY OF THE RFP SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. IT IS THE
 OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE INTERNET SITE FOR THE
 RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS, IF ANY. The Developmental
 Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and
 Diagnosis (DCTD), The National Cancer Institute (NCI) , wishes
 to establish contracts for the collection and taxonomy of plants
 from tropical and subtropical Africa and Madagascar, South
 East Asia, and the continental United States of America, for
 the evaluation as sources of potential antineoplastic agents,
 with the ultimate goal being the discovery of novel structural
 types which can be developed for the selective treatment of
 cancer. The successful offerors will be expected to provide
 qualified personnel, materials and equipment for the collection,
 identification, storage and shipping of plant samples (500
 per year from each of Africa and South East Asia, and 1000
 from the U.S.A.) to an NCI designated extraction facility.
 Collections will comprise approximately 0.3-1.0 kg (dry weight)
 of each sample, and each plant will be taxonomically identified
 as far as possible at the time of collection. Properly prepared
 voucher specimens for each plant will be collected for the
 purposes of unambiguous identification, and for permanent deposition
 at a minimum of two herbaria designated by NCI. The contractor
 will be expected to provide detailed documentation, including
 complete identification, of each plant collected. The collection
 team should include a qualified plant taxonomist, and personnel
 experienced in plant collection and identification, and having
 familiarity with the customs of the local populations. The
 Principal Investigator should be trained in botany or a related
 field, and should have at least five years of experience in
 plant collection and identification. It is anticipated that
 re-collections of up to 10 plants per year, in quantities of
 10-50 kg, will be required, starting in the second year of
 this project. The number of initial small scale collections
 will be reduced in proportion to the number and size of the
 large-scale re-collections undertaken. Collections will include
 species from as wide a variety of families and genera as possible.
 In the case of trees and large shrubs, samples of plant parts
 may be collected and stored separately for individual evaluation,
 with each part being considered equivalent to a plant sample.
 A list of genera with number of species collected in each genus
 since 1986 will be provided with the RFP, in order to aid in
 the determination of priorities in the collection program.
 In addition, a list of countries in which collections have
 been performed, and the number of samples collected in each
 country, will be provided with the RFP as well. The contractor
 will be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits including
 visas, collecting, shipping and export permits from foreign
 governments and agencies, for delivery of samples and voucher
 specimens to facilities in the United States. A &quot;Letter of
 Collection&quot; stating NCI&apos;s willingness to collaborate with local
 scientists and/or authorities in the discovery and development
 of novel drugs from plants collected will be provided. The
 Government anticipates the award of one contract for each of
 the regions designated (Sub-tropical Africa and Madagascar,
 South East Asia and the continental United States of America).
 This solicitation represents a re-competition of N02-CM-67244
 (Missouri Botanical Garden), N02-CM-67255 (University of Illinois
 at Chicago), and N02-CM- 67255 (Morton Arboretum Herbarium).
 This RFP N02-CM-17013-30 will be issued approximately 20 days
 after publication of this notice. Proposals will be due approximately
 45 days after the issue date. No collect calls will be accepted.

 language translation are also sought. (2) INTERFERENCE REDUCTION
 -- Technology is being sought to reduce/remove interference
 from audio signals in tactical communications. The signal of
 interest may be either voice, Morse code or data. Interferences
 are undesired signals and noise. The removal process must be
 on-line, real time and work without human intervention. In
 addition, the techniques shall require minimal training and
 be effective in negative signal to noise ratios. (3) VOICE
 COUNTERMEASURES -- This area includes techniques such as voice
 concatenation, synthesis, and transformation. Techniques that
 perform with limited training data, and in noisy environments
 are sought. (4) JAM-RESISTANT SPEECH COMMUNICATIONS -- Of interest
 is the development of low bit rate speech communication algorithms
 for multiple bit rate jam resistant communications. Papers
 should address techniques below 2400 bits/second and be applicable
 to the tactical (noisy, preserve speaker identity) environment.
 (5) MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE (MMI) - AFRL/IF is developing MMI
 concepts to meet tactical audio processing requirements. These
 requirements are hands busy/eyes busy, and are becoming more
 complex as additional capabilities are added. Of interest are
 the development of new MMI techniques and strategies to improve
 efficiency and reduce errors for these applications. Since
 there are multiple applications and tasks, it is also of interest
 to understand the interrelationships between various workloads
 (visual, manual, oral, etc.) and input/output modalities for
 transportability of techniques to other tasks within the same
 or different domains. Of high interest is the ability to identify
 tasks where speech synthesis and recognition are appropriate
 modalities and provide a means for estimating their performance.
 (6) BACKGROUND SOUND IDENTIFICATION -- This technical area
 seeks new and innovative techniques to identify sounds based
 on features extracted from an analysis of the background noise.
 This technology area is also for tactical use (Avg. 9 dB Signal
 to Noise Ratio,&lt;5 seconds recognition time, minimum training
 time). Deliverables for each area of this BAA will be technical
 reports, and when appropriate, demonstrations. DO NOT SUBMIT
 A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit
 three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (7) page white paper.
 The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title,
 Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section
 B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary. All responses
 to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Daniel Benincasa,
 Reference RL-BAA 97-07-PKPX, AFRL/IFEC, 32 Brooks Road, Rome,
 NY 13441-4114. Multiple white papers within the purview of
 this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose
 of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the
 part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to
 the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with
 the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical
 and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the
 submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete
 instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with
 the invitation for proposal submissions. Evaluation of proposals
 will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The Overall
 Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Applications
 to Tactical Speech Processing, (3) Innovative Approach and/or
 Techniques, (4) Compatibility with RL In- House Efforts, (5)
 Cost Effectiveness and Consistency. No further evaluation criteria
 will be used to determine whether white papers submitted are
 consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the
 Government. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated
 as they are received. Evaluation will be based on acceptability
 or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted
 under this BAA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options
 will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this
 BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY
 98. Individual awards will not normally $100K to $1000K. Awards
 of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts,
 grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending
 upon the nature of the work proposed. Total funding for this
 BAA is not expected to exceed $6.2M from all sources. Foreign-owned
 offerors are advised that their participation is subject to
 foreign disclosure review. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors
 should immediately contact the contracting focal point for
 information if they contemplate responding. Data subject to
 export control constraints may be involved and only firms on
 the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed
 access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in response
 to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any
 resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable
 expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR
 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a SECRET facility
 clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel
 identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared
 for access to SECRET information at the time of award. An Ombudsman
 has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors
 or potential offerors during the proposal development phase
 of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to
 be &quot;significant concerns&quot; and should be communicated directly
 to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308.
 The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority
 of the contracting officer or program manager, but to communicate
 contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations
 to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for
 this acquisition is Lt Col Ralph M. Lentz, Chief, Contracting
 Division, at 315-330-7746. When requested, the Ombudsman will
 maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.
 The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals
 or in the source selection process. An informational briefing
 is not planned. This BAA is open and effective until 36 months
 after publication of this announcement. To receive a copy of

DESC: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), 6801 Telegraph
 Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3398, has a requirement for Numerical
 Weather Prediction Model Comparison of the Chesapeake Bay.
 DTRA intends to award a sole source purchase order to MARAK
 Services, Inc. for this effort. The Contractor shall provide
 the following tasks: Background: Mesoscale numerical weather
 prediction (NWP) models generally fail to capture small scale
 flows associated with shorelines along bays and rivers under
 the influence of clear skies and weak high pressure. Differences
 in land-sea surface moisture content, temperature, and roughness
 due to diurnal, tidal, and agricultural processes are rarely
 captured in the NWP data assimilation and analysis process.
 These differences in surface characteristics are normally ingested
 as seasonal climate averages leaving the prognostics time integration
 with no skill to predict surface induced flows important to
 the transport and dispersion of hazardous plumes in these littoral
 regions. Noctural surface jet flows up to 15 knots, early morning
 surface winds opposing the prevailing flow over areas as small
 as 10 km2, and late afternoon shoreline wind direction shifts
 with speeds increasing by 5 knots are typical air-sea land
 interaction flows not currently predicted by mesoscale NWP
 models. MARAK has a unique weather &quot;mesonet&quot; around the
 Chesapeake Bay are. The routinely provides observations of
 air temperature, sea surface temperature, wind speed and wind
 direction at specific locations on the Chesapeake Bay for a
 large a windsurfing clientele. This is a one-of-a-kind-unique
 service that gives us an opportunity to measure within a densely
 populated region the weather of the boundary layer. Data will
 be integrated into the existing Marak Services, Inc. mesonet
 for real time availability, as such there are no other known
 sources which can provide the required services.

 National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
 (NIDDK) to negotiate on a sole source basis for the service
 of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans with Good Samaritan
 Regional Medical Center, 1111 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix, AZ
 85006, under the authority of FAR 6.302. The volunteers will
 be recruited by the Clinical Diabetes and Nutrition Section
 (CDNS) of the NIDDK in Phoenix, AZ. The service provider must
 be located near the CDNS in Phoenix, Arizona. Good Samaritan
 Regional is the only source that has been identified in the
 state of Arizona that can provide the PET Scan. Utilization
 of distant vendors would necessitate the involvement of commercial
 transportation, taking the volunteer patients out of state.
 These costs would increase the unit cost of each scan to an
 unacceptable amount. The specific Statement of Work shall be
 provided with the Request for Quote. The period of performance
 is anticipated for a one year period from date of award. The
 Institute intends to purchase the services by other than full
 and open competition from Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
 Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with
 a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the
 closing date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a
 request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received
 before the closing date of this announcement will be considered
 by the Government. A determination by the Government not to
 compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to
 this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will be considered solely for the purpose
 of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 It is anticipated that Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-00-579
 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date
 of the synopsis. Receipt of quotations will be due ten days
 (10) after the release of the RFQ. The anticipated award date
 is September 27, 2000. Request for copies of the RFQ must be
 in writing and may be FAXED to 301-480-4226. Quotations must

 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT HVAC PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
 INSPECTIONS AND SERVICE Purpose: This Performance Work Statement
 (PWS) provides for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual
 checks, inspections and service for all heating, venting and
 air conditioning (HVAC) equipment located at AFRTS-BC, March
 ARB, Ca. Contractor will use manufacturers recommended service
 schedule to test, inspect, lubricate, calibrate, adjust, clean,
 troubleshoot, reprogram/reset, etc., all HVAC automation systems/equipment,
 software, wiring, chillers, air handler units (AHUs), variable
 air volume (VAV) and fan powered air thermal units (FPATUs),
 small cooling units, boiler, pumps/motors, fans, cooling towers,
 and any other HVAC unit or system in use to ensure proper,
 optimum operation (see attached list of equipment). Contractor
 will submit a yearly Schedule of Services to be performed,
 with dates, to Contracting Office, and Contracting Office Representative
 (COR). This allows for availability and monitoring by Facility
 personnel, as well as opportunity to discuss system status.
 Contractor will provide written report of finding(s), corrective
 action(s), and/or recommendations for additional service or
 repairs over and above preventive maintenance services. Contractor
 is encouraged to suggest services or improvements over and
 above this contract to enhance system operation. Contractor
 will remove and dispose, off-site, all oils, lubricants, refrigerants,
 hazardous waste products, used/replaced parts, etc., connected
 with the service of the HVAC system. Due to the critical nature
 of AFRTS-BC on-air operations, contractor will respond within
 four (4) hours, 24 hours-a-day, for emergency service to &quot;downed/out-of-operation&quot;
 equipment deemed critical by COR, or alternate Facilities/Engineering
 personnel. Contractor will troubleshoot critical equipment
 and/or associated components, and return system to an operational,
 on-line status as soon as possible. If emergency actions/repairs
 require additional parts, materials, labor, etc., over and
 above using technical know-how and expertise (resetting, bypassing,
 jumper-wiring, etc.), contractor will quote repair cost to
 COR and receive approval prior to proceeding. Note 1: York
 International is the prime manufacturer of the HVAC equipment
 on-site, and the sole proprietary distributor, and installer,
 of the York Facility Manager Front End Graphics and ISN equipment
 software. Therefore, contractor shall follow all guidelines
 and procedures recommended by York engineers; contractor shall
 also adhere to service procedures, timelines and general industry
 standards set forth by manufacturers of other HVAC equipment
 in use. Note 2: All VAV and FPATU control circuitry are currently
 under warranty from York, due to recent installation of the
 York ISN, and Facility Manager Front-End Graphics software.
 Repairs to this equipment, as related to the upgrades, are
 at no cost to the government until warranty end (March 1, 2001).
 However, Facility personnel will perform some troubleshooting
 and minor repairs (e.g., change velocity probes, actuators,
 transformers, etc.) that were not included in the upgrades.

 concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns
 are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has
 been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved
 through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman
 is not to diminish the authority of the program director or
 contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor
 concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the
 appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman
 will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the
 concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation
 of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate,
 potential offerors may contact Ombudsman James Grant, Chief,
 Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared
 to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to
 resolve your concerns. This acquisition may/does involve technology

 who may participate are those that are certified and registered
 with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.

 DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request
 this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics

 not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources
 received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing
 in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in
 the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources
 (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources
 may not participate as potential prime contractors but could,
 if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based
 upon market research, the Government is not using the policies
 contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its
 solicitation for the described supplies or services. However,
 interested persons may identify to the contracting officer
 their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&apos;s requirement

DESC: Under authority of FAR 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the
 Engineering Field Activity, Northwest, intends to award a sole
 source contract to Howard S. Wright Construction Co. for Building
 433 Security Department relocation at Naval Station Bremerton.
 This is not a request for proposal. The construction contract
 for the Building 433 Security Department relocation parallels
 an effort underway through an alliance between the Puget Sound
 Naval Shipyard, Naval Station Bremerton, and Kitsap Transit.
 The Government has determined that awarding the contract for
 the Security Department relocation to a contractor other than
 Howard S. Wright Construction Co. would result in a substantial
 duplication of cost, considerably increase coordination efforts
 on the part of the Government, and impact the Government and
 Kitsap Transit Alliance. This procurement will continue the
 alliance between the Government and Kitsap Transit creating
 project continuity under one contractor. The work required
 under this contract includes all labor, supervision, materials
 and equipment required to design and build interior tenant
 improvements to the south two-thirds of the second floor of
 Building 433 at Naval Station Bremerton. The work consists
 of interior tenant improvements consisting of new office spaces,
 locker rooms, and improvements to the existing corridors. Specifically,
 the work includes new suspended acoustical ceilings in selected
 areas, doors, glue down carpeting, VCT, painting of walls and
 exposed ceilings, new radiators and associated piping modifications,
 ventilation ducting, new electrical outlets, LAN, and lighting.
 Preparation for the new construction will include demolition
 of stud and clay tile/plastered walls, suspended metal ceilings,
 glue down carpeting, VAT, asbestos insulated piping and removal
 of selected electrical items (lighting, outlets and wiring).
 During performance of this work, asbestos, hazardous waste,
 or pollution abatement may be encountered. No other technical
 information will be given. A determination by the government
 not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to
 this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

DESC: This is a Market Survey attempting to identify any vendors
 who are capable of providing the various types of existing
 switching equipment with associated peripherals and ancillary
 items that are delineated below. The U.S. Army, Office
 of the Project Manager, Warfighter Information Networks - Terrestrial
 (PM WIN-T), is seeking sources from which existing tactical
 communications switching equipment that has been certified
 interoperable for joint-services operation can be purchased
 and provided to various government Defense Agencies and Services.
 The current contract for such equipment is with General
 Dynamics - Communication Systems (GD - CS) (formerly General
 Telephone Electronics Corporation - Government Systems Division)
 located in Taunton, Massachusetts. It is contract number DAAB07-97-D-F758
 and it expires on March 27, 2002. To PM WIN-T&apos;s knowledge,
 the only tactical communications switching equipment that currently
 meets the government&apos;s requirements is that equipment which
 is manufactured by GD-CS. Specifically, this Market Survey
 addresses the following tactical communications equipment and
 associated items: Compact Digital Switch (CDS), GD part number
 (P/N) 02-2758810-1; five variations of the Switch Multiplexer
 Unit (SMU), GD P/Ns 03-2755652-1, 03-2758529-1, 03-2758533-1,
 03-2758537-1, and 03-2759270-1; the Army family of Line Termination

 On-Line Operational Program (CSOLOP) software, which is under
 the configuration management control of the CECOM Software
 Engineering Center (SEC). Additionally, any proposed alternative
 to the above equipment must be form, fit and function exactly
 the same as the aforementioned equipment. The equipment designated
 above provides existing, forward-looking, tactical switching
 systems, which have already been certified for Joint Services
 interoperability by the Executive Agent (EA) for Theatre Joint
 Tactical Networks (TJTN). Any replacement systems must also
 be certified for Joint Services interoperability.As the Government
 does not own the full technical documentation and data rights
 to the aforementioned equipment, potential qualified vendors
 must obtain/possess the technical documentation and data rights
 to the GD-CS equipment, and all the necessary associated items
 to include Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) in order to meet
 the various terminal interface requirements of all potential
 customers. All potential qualified vendors must also possess
 and demonstrate an intimate knowledge of the systems with which
 the aforementioned equipment will interface, i.e. the Mobile
 Subscriber Equipment (MSE) and AN/TTC-39 families of circuit
 switch and message switching assemblages. Vendors must possess
 and demonstrate the capability to provide technical engineering
 support services in order to assist potential customers in
 integrating the proposed equipment into any mission specific
 system, equipment and/or assemblages. This announcement
 is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government
 to pay for proposal preparation costs. Interested parties should
 be alert for subsequent announcements that may be published
 in the Commerce Business Daily. Responses to this announcement
 should contain a Title Page, Synopsis, System(s) Description,
 and Supporting Data. The title page should contain the system(s),
 date, and the name and telephone number of the author and/or
 other points of contact. The synopsis should provide evidence
 of vendor experience and briefly summarize the capabilities
 of the vendor to support the equipment cited above. The synopsis
 should also reflect the vendor&apos;s previously demonstrated performance
 in managing and supporting similar equipment/systems comparable
 in size and complexity. It should also provide approximate
 cost and lead times for the purchasing of proposed equipment.
 The supporting data should augment the description(s) with
 any test data or other information, which would help fortify
 the assertions provided in the description(s). Vendors capable
 of furnishing the equipment that will satisfy the above specified
 requirements must so indicate by responding in writing to Project

 NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION;
 QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL
 NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is PM0059 and the solicitation
 is being issued as a Request for Proposal solicitation document
 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect
 through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-18. The Environmental
 Protection Agency anticipates that the contract will be awarded
 to Andersen Instruments Incorporated as a result of this solicitation.
 A firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result
 from the award of this solicitation. This procurement is NOT
 a total small business set aside and the SIC No. is 3829 with
 a size standard of 500 Employees. This procurement is not a
 follow-on to a prior contract. This acquisition is for the
 delivery, FOB Destination, EPA Research Triangle Park, NC,
 27709, of a PM2.5 Continuous Particle Speciation Monitor.
 The EPA, Office of air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)
 is currently assisting states in implementing the National
 PM2.5 Chemical Speciation Network. State and local agencies
 are expected to have approximately 300 speciation samplers
 in the fully-implemented network. A major component of this
 program is the National PM2.5 Speciation Trends Network which
 consists of 54 sites located in major metropolitan areas which
 will initially collect samples on a one in three day basis.
 In FY2001, ten of these sites will be required to collect samples
 on a daily basis. Current sampling technology does not permit
 daily sample collection and OAQPS must assess the adequacy
 of new continuous particulate and gaseous monitors which could
 be used by state agencies to meet daily requirements. In addition,
 there is some concern that aerosols that are being collected
 by samplers using filtration techniques are altered by either
 sorption of gaseous pollutants or lose constituents because
 of aerosol volatilization during sampling. OAQPS is planning
 to address these concerns through the procurement of a monitoring
 system which is uniquely capable of measuring both water soluble
 gas phase and particulate pollutants. The monitor, developed
 by Andersen Instruments, will be briefly operated by OAQPS
 at Research Triangle Park and then be collocated with filter-based
 speciation samplers at one of the National Speciation Trends
 Sites and operated by a state agency for a 3-6 month assessment
 study. The detailed specifications for the monitor are as follows:
 Physical Specifications: 1. The central unit of the analyzer
 shall be modular in design, allowing for easy access for servicing.
 2. The total weight of each analyzer shall no exceed 80 pounds.
 3. The AC input power cord to the primary power supply shall
 be 3 conductor and at least 9 feet in length, with a standard
 3-prong grounded plug. The supply voltage shall be nominal,
 115 plus or minus 10 VAC. 4. The on-site data logger/controller
 shall include all software and control capabilities necessary
 to operate and calibrate the analyzer. 5. The analyzer unit
 and data logger/controller shall have a digital read-out on
 the front panel that continuously displays the previous hourly
 averaged concentration of each PM2.5 particulate species analyzed
 from ambient air (display shall include surrogate standard
 concentration). 6. The analyzer shall be provided with an on-board
 data logger/controller with the memory capacity for over six
 months of hourly averaged values. 7. the analyzer shall be
 equipped with a temperature sensor to automatically correct
 for temperature changes. 8. The sample flow rate of the system
 shall be controlled to 16.7 liters per minute (LPM), to maintain
 the proper cut-point through the inlet of the instrument. 9.
 The sampler shall be equipped with at least one RS232 port.
 The RS232 ports shall allow data collection via an on-site
 personal computer. 10. The inlet tube and hardware support
 kit shall include all necessary hardware required for normal
 operation )i.e. Tubing, inlet bracket, unions, etc.). 11. Equipment
 must by listed and labeled by athird party listing agency approved
 by the North Carolina Building Code Council. (List of agencies
 available upon request). Performance Specifications: These
 specifications describe the minimum acceptable quality or performance
 level of the equipment. Superior alternatives will be considered
 as compliant to specifications. 1. The instrument limit of
 detection shall be approximately +/- 0.05 micrograms/cubic
 meter or better. 2. The instrument shall have user-selectable
 full-scale ranges at from 0-5 microgram/m3 to 0 to 100 microgram/m3
 for each compound analyzed. 3. The instrument shall have the
 capacity to inject liquid standards for calibration. 4. The
 accuracy of the instrument for each compound shall be +/- 10%
 or better at the midrange of the respective calibration span.
 5. The instrument shall maintain a PM2.5 size cut at a sample
 flow rate of 16.7 LPM using the Sharp Cut Cyclone inlet. The
 instrument shall have control of the inlet flow to +/- 5% or
 better of the expected 16.7 LPM. 6. The analyzer shall operate
 within specifications at room temperature ranging from 15 degrees
 C to 35 degrees C. Any temperature change within this range
 shall no cause more than +/- 2% change of actual reading at
 any point on the scale. Analyzer shall not be damaged or require
 recalibration after exposure to ambient temperature variation
 between 4 degrees C to 44 degrees Ce while in operation. 7.
 Each instrument shall possess the ability to perform surrogate
 standard injections with each sample analysis. The surrogate
 standard shall be used as an indicator for calibration drift.
 8. All tubing shall have connections, controls, and fittings
 that are designed for rapid, easy and repeated disassembly
 and re-assembly, as may be required for cleaning, and repair.

 NOTICE: Engineering Field Division (EFD) Southwest, Naval Facilities
 Engineering Command, is planning to issue a small business
 set-aside solicitation for Environmental Remedial Action Operations
 (RAO)/Long Term Maintenance (LTM) services and is seeking information
 from small businesses that will enable the Government to advise
 potential offerors about their probability of being viable
 competitors. This presolicitation notice is covered under FAR
 Part 15.202 Advisory multi-step process. The Government will
 evaluate all responses to this RFI in accordance with the criteria
 stated herein, and will advise each respondent in writing (by
 email, fax, or letter) whether or not the potential offeror
 is considered to be a viable competitor. The Government will
 advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors
 of the general basis for that opinion. Notwithstanding the
 advice provided by the Government in response to potential
 offerors&apos; submissions, all respondents may participate in the
 resultant acquisition. The planned solicitation will be issued
 under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 8744. The
 small business size standard for SIC Code 8744 is 500 employees.
 On October 1, 2000, North American Industrial Classification
 System (NAICS) codes will replace SIC codes. The equivalent
 code to SIC 8744 will be NAICS code 562910, Environmental Remediation

 The preponderance of work would be located at Navy and Marine

 and to a much lesser extent in Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Alaska,
 Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. EFD Southwest anticipates
 awarding multiple contracts from the planned solicitation,

 Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures to the small business
 firms offering the Government the best value, price and other
 factors considered. Fixed price indefinite quantity contracts
 with terms of a base year and four one-year options would be
 awarded from the planned solicitation. The estimated EFD Southwest
 RAO/LTM program value over the next five years is approximately
 $120M. The total capacity of all contracts awarded from the
 planned solicitation would be $180M. The number and amount
 of task orders awarded under each contract would depend upon
 the results of the task order competition conducted among the
 firms that would have received contract awards under the planned
 solicitation. Typical work for this contract would be to operate,
 maintain, and optimize the performance of ongoing remedial
 action systems. Types of remedial actions would include, but
 would not be limited to, capped landfills, pump-and-treat remediation,
 bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation,
 bioventing, air sparging, reactive walls, thermal treatment,
 phytoremediation, soil washing, capped aquatic environments,
 storm water systems, and free product recovery. This contract

 and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean
 Water Act (CWA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Toxic
 Substances Control Act (TSCA), any subsequently promulgated
 federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and any applicable
 DoD, Navy and/or Marine Corps policies, procedures, and instructions.
 (2) Sample and analyze materials and media related to O&amp;M of
 the remediation systems. (3) Develop technical memoranda and
 reports including, but not limited to: the findings of inspection,
 monitoring, testing, and sampling, modeling, five-year reviews
 and response complete/site closure reports. (4) Evaluate sampling
 strategy, data collection, QA/QC and field procedures to maximize
 program efficiency, and support compliance and closure objectives.
 (5) Optimize system performance by evaluating its design, operation,
 energy utilization, supplies alternative, equipment reliability,
 process control, and maintenance program. (6) Identify system
 upgrades/changes or technology enhancements to improve efficiency
 and reduce costs. (7) Implement system modifications and revise
 O&amp;M plans to match the new requirements. (8) Provide technical
 and administrative support for public involvement activities,
 as required. (9) Prepare human health and ecological risk assessments,

SUBJECT: ELECTRICTY MARKET INTEGRATION&amp;INTERCONNECTION IN SOUTH
 AMERICA
DESC: SUBJECT: ELECTRICITY MARKET INTEGRATION AND INTERCONNECTION
 IN SOUTH AMERICA. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s National
 Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends
 to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to The Comision
 de Integracion Electrica Regional (CIER). PROJECT OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:
 The purpose of this procurement is to support a regional study
 effort which reviews the opportunities and barriers between
 the ten (10) major countries in South America to reach regional
 market integration and interconnection of their electric systems.
 The study will focus on the technical, operating and commercial
 standards regulating power transactions, power dispatch, and
 interconnections and it will incorporate participation and
 input from the CIER (Comision de Integracion Electrica Regional)
 members, governments, regulatory authorities, power utilities
 and private development companies of South America, as well
 as the World Bank and USDOE. The study is divided into two
 phases. The first phase will examine the conditions prevailing
 in the South American electricity sector and the second phase
 will provide recommendations as to how to promote regional
 efficiency and increase regional interconnections. SCOPE OF
 WORK: Phase I will be devoted to the gathering and analysis
 of basic data related to the technical and operational procedures
 currently used in the different countries of South America
 for electricity exchange, as well as to the institutional/regulatory
 approaches. It will include an analysis of the issues and bottlenecks
 that may have hampered active development of electricity trading
 activities within the region. Phase II, in the area of technical
 and operational procedures, will identify possible harmonization
 and compatibilities in the various nations&apos; standards and procedures
 for the operation of electrical systems. It will propose rules
 related to the operation of international interconnections
 in normal and emergency conditions. In the area of regulatory
 aspects it will identify possible options among regulatory
 or policy issues related to the operation of international
 interconnections and recommend a minimum common set of rules
 for ensuring reliability in the functioning of major interconnected
 systems along with recommendations on rules, procedures and
 economic transactions methodology to be applied to transmission
 ancillary services. DELIVERABLES:1 Report Package on current
 state (as of September 30, 2000) of the Study on Market Integration
 and Interconnection in South America. This report package is
 to include the results of the workshop held in Rio de Janeiro
 on May 24-25, 2000, i.e., all of the presentations made by
 the speakers (government and private sector representatives)
 during the workshop (in electronic form); the general report
 of the results and recommendations for Phase I of the study
 (in electronic form and hardcopy); and the proposed outline
 for Phase II of the study. 2.Proceedings of working session
 to be held in conjunction with CIER&apos;s 2000 Congress in Buenos
 Aires, Argentina (November 26-30, 2000). During this working
 session CIER&apos;s Executive Board and members of the Working Group
 (of which DOE is a member), will review the draft results of
 Phase II of the study. There will also be a presentation during
 the Congress sessions where the results of Phase I as well
 as the draft results of Phase II will be presented to the congress
 attendees. The objective of this information dissemination
 on the study is to obtain feedback and critical support from
 the South American decision-makers. The feedback will be included
 in the final analysis of the study. 3. Report Package on final
 results of the Study on Market Integration and Interconnection
 in South America. This report package will include the results
 of the workshop to be held in a place to be determined in April
 2001 (i.e., all of the presentations made by government and
 private sector representatives during the workshop); and the
 general report of the results and recommendations for Phase
 II of the study (in electronic form (PowerPoint and/or Word)
 and hardcopy) including strategy for implementation of the
 recommendations. This purchase order is being issued to The
 Comision de Integracion Electrica Regional (CIER) because it
 is a non-governmental organization which is comprised of the
 electric utilities and non-profit organizations linked with
 the national electric sectors of the ten South American countries
 ( Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay,
 Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela). CIER was created on July 10,
 1964, on the basis of a proposition approved during the First
 Regional Electrical Integration Congress, then held in Montevideo,
 as an initiative of the Uruguayan Electric Sector Authorities.
 The Commission became operational in 1965. Since its beginnings,
 CIER has gained the support of the South American electric
 industries, and clearly has reflected the strong need of collaboration
 among them. CIER is comprised of experienced professionals
 who have years of demonstrated success in establishing communication
 at the highest levels of legislative and energy organizations
 within Latin America. These individuals performance records
 that are recognized as outstanding and create confidence among
 the potential customer population. The main objective of this
 non-profit international organization is to promote and encourage
 the integration of the regional electric sectors, through greater
 assistance and technical cooperation of electric power utilities
 and governmental organizations in the Member Countries; transfer
 of knowledge, information, experiences and documentation in
 technical, economic and legal fields; projects development
 in a regional scope, especially considering the feasibility
 of electric international interconnections; orientation and
 coordination of general interest activities for utilities and
 organizations, including research and development fields; establish
 general specifications and technical standards which area accepted
 in all Member Countries; promotion of regional statistic uniformity,
 strengthened through the operation of an up-to-date Data Bank;
 and the promotion of electric power regional utilization with
 special concern about environmental problems. CIER&apos;s headquarters
 in Montevideo, Uruguay holds an important information and documentation
 center, whose evolution to a computerized Data Bank is being
 achieved. At the present time, CIER has five areas of the power
 industry located within this data base (generation, transmission,
 distribution, commercialization, and corporate) in which the
 following technical topics are covered: planning and environment,
 energy movement and transactions, projects and construction
 works, operation and maintenance, distribution engineering,
 electric energy commercialization, finance, administrative
 business and legal and regulatory affairs. In addition, there
 are specific working groups established within CIER to develop
 specialized matters, such as the bulk energy markets and interconnections
 study for South America. The activities which are proposed
 in this procurement will be used to promote the development
 of one or several interconnected, cooperative electricity markets,
 which could translate on business opportunities for U.S. electric
 private sector companies interested in investing in the region
 . It will also provide continuity to the DOE effort which was
 established at the conference, &quot;Integration of Electricity
 and Natural Gas in the Southern Cone&quot; which was held in Montevideo,
 Uruguay in 1997. CIER is a organization that is uniquely situated
 and qualified to undertake this work on behalf of DOE. CIER
 has a pivotal position in South America as a renowned organization
 which has the access to power industry data throughout the
 electricity sector of Latin America and sources of information
 that is unavailable to the DOE and within the United States.
 There is no known competing organization that can bring to
 DOE the same technical and policy level of experience, contacts,
 and capabilities that are so directly capable of achieving
 the DOE goals within the South America region. In addition,
 DOE knows of no other entity which can conduct such an activity
 and produce a quality study within the time frames prescribed.
 This request is considered to be sole source to The Comision
 de Integracion Electrica Regional (CIER). Therefore, no solicitation
 will result from this announcement. This award shall be made
 using simplified acquisition procedures. Request for information
 should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-4963.

 20740. 301-744-6570; Email: pricebl@ih.navy.mil OBJECTIVE:
 In support of the DARPA SPO Immune Building Program, NAVSEA
 Indian Head is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) from
 qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs,
 and DoE laboratories under BAA00-005. This program seeks to
 make military buildings (such as barracks, office buildings,
 and Command and Control centers) far less attractive targets
 for attack by airborne/aerosolized chemical or biological warfare
 agents (CWA, BWA), by modifying and augmenting building infrastructure
 to greatly reduce the effectiveness of any such attack. The
 main DARPA focus is on the challenging problem of protection
 from internal releases. Infrastructure modifications/augmentations
 could include changes to the ordinary HVAC infrastructure -
 such as real-time, active control of airflow patterns, and/or
 full-time, passive, highly efficient filtration - in addition
 to whatever other modifications might be appropriate - e.g.
 real-time neutralization of the aerosolized agent, networked
 surveillance systems self decontaminating coatings, or rapid
 ingress/egress airlocks. The program has three goals: to protect
 the human inhabitants of such buildings in the event of an
 attack; to restore the building to full function as quickly
 as possible after the attack; and to preserve forensic evidence
 for treatment and retaliation. Through this BAA, the Government
 solicits proposals to develop component technologies that hold
 the promise of significantly impacting our ability to implement
 such systems. Particular areas of interest include, but are
 not limited to, novel filtration, optimized air handling, neutralization,
 and decontamination technologies. (Through another BAA (NAVSEA
 Indian Head BAA00-006), the Government is soliciting proposals
 to design, develop, implement, optimize, and demonstrate complete
 systems architectures to achieve the three program goals.)
 ACQUISITION INFORMATION: It is anticipated that multiple
 awards will result from this BAA. Performance under this BAA
 will take place in two separate Phases. Phase I will last
 approximately 9 months and will be used to demonstrate and/or
 develop subsystems, components and technologies for possible
 evaluation at full scale in Phase II. It is anticipated that
 multiple Phase I contracts will be awarded. Performers will
 evaluate the threat; develop selected subsystems, components
 or technologies to mitigate the threat; perform adequate testing
 and analysis to demonstrate and assess the mitigation capability;
 and design full-scale systems for possible Phase II testing.
 Phase II is an approximately 15-30 month effort to develop
 prototype systems from successful Phase I efforts for full-scale
 implementation and testing in the facilities developed under
 BAA00-006 or in other facilities. All parties interested
 in participating in this BAA must register their interest by
 providing the following information for their organization:
 a principal point of contact, phone number, fax number, and
 email. This information should be emailed to IB_baa00_005@darpa.mil,
 with the subject line &quot;REGISTER&quot;. Registration will allow access
 to a secure (password-protected) website for this solicitation.

 20740. 301-744-6570 Email: pricebl@ih.navy.mil OBJECTIVE:
 In support of the DARPA SPO Immune Building Program, NAVSEA
 Indian Head is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) from
 qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs,
 and DoE laboratories under BAA00-006. This program seeks to
 make military buildings (such as barracks, office buildings,
 and Command and Control centers) far less attractive targets
 for attack by airborne/aerosolized chemical or biological warfare
 agents (CWA, BWA), by modifying and augmenting building infrastructure
 to greatly reduce the effectiveness of any such attack. The
 main DARPA focus is on the challenging problem of protection
 from internal releases. Infrastructure modifications/augmentations
 could include changes to the ordinary HVAC infrastructure -
 such as real-time, active control of airflow patterns, and/or
 full-time, passive, highly efficient filtration - in addition
 to whatever other modifications might be appropriate - e.g.
 real-time neutralization of the aerosolized agent, or networked
 surveillance systems. The program has three goals: to protect
 the human inhabitants of such buildings in the event of an
 attack; to restore the building to full function as quickly
 as possible after the attack; and to preserve forensic evidence
 for treatment and retaliation. Through this BAA, the Government
 solicits proposals to carry out one of the program thrusts
 - namely, to design, develop, implement, test, optimize, and
 demonstrate complete systems architectures to achieve the three
 program goals. Performers will design building-protection systems
 architectures; develop, as necessary, the required component
 technologies within those systems; implement the systems solutions
 at full scale in well-instrumented testbeds; test the effectiveness
 of various protection strategies and systems architectures;
 optimize the most effective protection systems and the required
 components; and, finally, measure the overall protection provided
 by that optimal systems solution. These tests of system performance
 will be supervised and refereed by outside overseers. Performers
 are responsible for all aspects of work required to successfully
 demonstrate the performance of their system against the threat
 described, and to optimize this performance to cover the widest
 possible range of threats, implemented in the most stressing
 manner possible. (Through another BAA (NAVSEA Indian Head BAA00-005),
 the Government is soliciting proposals to develop component
 technologies that hold the promise of significantly improving
 our ability to implement building protection systems.) ACQUISITION
 INFORMATION: It is anticipated that multiple awards will result
 from this BAA. Performance under this BAA will take place in
 two separate Phases. Phase I is a short-term effort of
 approximately ten months duration. It is anticipated that three
 Phase I contracts will be awarded. Performers will evaluate
 the threat; assess strategies and candidate architectures for
 achieving the program goals; survey existing and emerging technologies
 for implementing these architectures; determine the unknowns
 and uncertainties associated with these architectures; design
 a full-scale test facility to be used during Phase II for implementation,
 experimentation, and optimization of building protection systems;
 and create a plan to build and then experiment with the test
 facility during Phase II. In addition, performers will carry
 out risk-reduction activities, as appropriate, such as component
 development, test facility preparation/check-out, etc. Phase
 II is a multi-year effort for experimentation and optimization
 of building protection systems. It is anticipated that the
 Phase I performers will be downselected to two Phase II performers.
 Performers will fabricate and integrate the test facility;
 experiment in that facility to determine the effectiveness
 of strategies and to evaluate the performance of their various
 systems designs; develop an optimal system for the threat (or
 a few systems optimized to different classes of threat); configure
 the testbed to implement and optimize this optimal system(s);
 and measure the effectiveness of this system against a set
 of (simulated) releases representing internal and external
 threats. The Government reserves the right to fund, as an
 option, follow-on Phase III testbed measurements for performers
 who are successful under Phase II. All parties interested
 in participating in this BAA must register their interest by
 providing the following information for their organization:
 a principal point of contact, phone number, fax number, and
 email. This information should be emailed to IB_baa00_006@darpa.mil,
 with the subject line &quot;REGISTER&quot;. Registration will allow access
 to a secure (password-protected) website for this solicitation.
 This website will include information regarding classified
 (SECRET) reports available to registered organizations with
 the appropriate security clearance. In addition, DARPA will
 make available to all who register a complete list of the registered
 organizations and the contact information, unless any organization
 specifically requests not to be included on such a list. 
 DARPA believes that the broad performance requirements under
 this BAA may necessitate the formation of multi-disciplinary
 teams or consortia. The secure website described above will
 be used to facilitate teaming in response to this BAA. Each
 registered organization may submit a brief (not to exceed two

OFFADD: Administrative Contracts Service Center (3803R), Environmental
 Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan Building - 7th Floor, 1300
 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460
SUBJECT: GASOLINE MODELING REPORT
DESC: The Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a
 sole source Simplified Acquisition purchase order to MathPro,
 Inc. Post Office Box 34404 West Bethesda, MD 20827-0404. The
 Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) requires a
 contractor to further resolve, through refinery modeling, the
 issues of non-oxygenated market share, fuel property values,
 and oxygen content for California&apos;s Phase 3 requirements (CaRFG3)
 if the oxygen requirement were waived with an MTBE ban in place.
 OTAQ also requires, for comparison purposes, an estimate or
 estimates of fuel property values for CaRFG3 if a waiver were
 not granted (i.e. 100% ethanol-oxygenated CaRFG3 in federal
 areas). OTAQ anticipates that market share, property values
 and oxygen content are somewhat interdependent. For example,
 fuel property values for both oxygenated and non-oxygenated
 CaRFG3 could change as market share is varied, or the optimum
 market share could vary with the oxygen content in the oxygenated
 portion of CaRFG3. More specifically, OTAQ wants to identify
 the most likely (i.e. economically optimum) market share, oxygen
 content and fuel property scenario. OTAQ also wants to understand
 how deviations from the market share (and possibly oxygen content)
 optimum values could affect fuel property values. For example,
 if it was determined that the optimal market share for non-oxygenated
 CaRFG3 in a split market was 40%, an additional case might
 be run where the non-oxygenated market share was constrained
 to be 60%. The contractor&apos;s analysis shall also identify and
 discuss those market factors that are likely to have a significant
 impact on the extent of use of oxygenates in CaRFG3. DESCRIPTION
 OF TASKS The contractor shall, after considering currently
 available analyses and information sources:1. Describe and
 recommend specific cases to be modeled; 2. Describe key modeling
 assumptions applicable to this modeling effort; 3. After consultation
 with and approval of the OTAQ Project Officer, perform the
 required modeling runs; and 4. Prepare a written summary containing
 modeling results. SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION No other source
 has updated California refinery model already capable of adequately
 predicting the properties of market changes on California gasoline
