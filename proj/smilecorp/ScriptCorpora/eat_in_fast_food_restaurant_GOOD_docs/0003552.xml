Tips to be able to afford being a stay at home mum?
 Any good tips on how to afford being able to stay at home full time to raise my kids when my 2nd baby comes along? For my first baby I went back to work part time, but I&apos;m looking for any good ways of cutting costs in our lifestyle so that I can be a full time mum for both of my kids. We don&apos;t have a particularly extravagent lifestyle, but I&apos;m just on the lookout for any cost saving tips. We already have most baby stuff because we already have a child...

 -Make a budget (write down everything you spend for the next month) and compare it to what your husband made this month. If you are spending too decide what you can live without

-Learn to cook if you don&apos;t know how there are plenty of recipes online or even on the sides of cans at the grocery store. It is nearly always cheaper to cook your own meal than to eat out (and usually healthier too)

-Get into the habit of having sandwiches for lunch. They are cheap especially if you make your own bread. (If your parents or someone offers to get you guys a Christmas gift a breadmaker is awesome... throw the ingredients in and you have cheap healthy bread a few hours later)

-Turn you thermostat up or down a degree (depending on if it is summer/winter)

-Put your kids in the shower with you to bath (depending on their age) it saves a lot of water or bathe them together when they are old enough. When filling the bathtub only fill it up a couple inches.

-Turn down your water heater (prevents burns and also saves gas/electricity.

-INSULATE all around windows and pipes and even around your water heater especially if it is in your garage or a cold basement

-Drink more water... pop or lots of cups of juice everyday is not healthy and costs more than water. And drink it from the tap unless it is truly unhealthy

-Turn off lights as much as possible. Open drapes for lunch rather than turning on the light. Depending on the age of your kids they might even have fun with a candlelight dinner (and you will save on electricity)

-Determine if you really need the internet / cable package that you have

-Hold each other accountable for money you spend. Agree on an amount that you can spend up to. In our house if one of us is going to spend more than $25 on something (other than groceries) we wait and check with the other before buying said item. Sometimes just by waiting we will decide ourselves that we really don&apos;t need that item we wanted or we might be able to buy a cheaper version.

-Shop at garage sales, thrift stores, consignment sales etc.

-Make toys from recylable plastic bottles or boxes or whatever you have laying around the house rather than buying expensive toys (there are lots of internet sites and books on activities to do with kids that don&apos;t cost much)

-Learn how to do stuff yourself. For example, our deck needed stained. We got an estimate that it would cost $875. We decided to do it ourselves and although it has taken us weeks to finish it by just doing a few hours here and there it has only cost us about $100 compared to the estimate for $875. Also my husband bought a book and replaced our water heater himself rather than paying someone to do it. Change your own oil in your car (not hard to do if you find a book or go online).

-Have date night at the park with a picnic lunch or if you really want to go all out with food from the dollar menu at your local fast food restaurant. The kids will have fun, it is free, and at least you are out of the house.

-Breasfeed (only cost is a few nursing bras). No formula to buy.

-Make your own baby food. Nearly any food can be cooked for a little while then put in the blender and pureed. I found I could make organic baby food cheaper than the cheapest jarred food and I knew exactly what was in my food. For a great reference I used&quot;Super Baby Food&quot;by Ruth Yaron. You can find it at most bookstores or online.

-Good luck! It can be challenging at first to stay within your budget, but it is so worth it. I LOVE staying home with my son.

 Double coupon days at the grocery store and shop consignment for clothes.
I made the move to full time mom shortly before conceiving #2. We only have our&quot;date night&quot;at home and let #1 stay at a grandparent&apos;s house close by, but even with 48k less a year, we&apos;re a lot happier. There&apos;s no feeling in the world like being there full time to see everything. I wouldn&apos;t trade it for anything.

 What I&apos;ve done to help cut costs is only go grocery shopping twice a month and stock up on food every payday(which for my husband is the 1st and 15th). I usually spend about $150 for groceries every payday so around $300 at most a month. I have found a cheap place to shop that I have to drive about 20 miles, but I figure the savings really help. I only go to the local grocery stores if I absolutely have too because they are expensive. I mainly just get diapers from the local grocery store. What I&apos;ve found really helps is buying frozen vegetables because fresh ones are always expensive and that has helped save me quite a bit of money. Right now I have a family of 3 and I also have a 2nd child on the way so it will be a family of 4 in January. Another thing I have done is completely eliminate television from our lives because it costs so much. I instead use Netflix to watch movies online when my husband and I want to relax and watch a movie and they also have great kids shows to watch online. That saves us over 100 dollars a month. We are only paying around $15 for Netflix. We also chose a cheap cell phone plan and cheap phones. My husband needs his cell phone for work and we don&apos;t have a land line so for us cell phones are working best. Also if you have 2 cars, they aren&apos;t always necessary. It always depends on your situation, but sometimes being able to drop off and pick up your husband from work might help with gas costs and car maintenance costs. That&apos;s pretty much all I can think of right now. Hope I gave you a little bit of advice.

 I live in one of the most expensive areas in the world and even though my husband makes a pretty good living we have to make sure we stay within our budget. It&apos;s tough so I have to make due with what we have.

 I am a single stay at home mum so money is very tight. Firstly you can keep the power bills down by using energy saving lightbulbs and turn everything of at its source. if you use a remote for example to turn off the tv it goes to standby and is technically still on. The onlyappliancee i have on around the clock is the fridge. we don&apos;t use the heater we put on extra clothes and cuddle up under blankets. My last power bill was $30 for 2 months. Buy extra food in the shopping and make meals to go in the freezer. This way if you are too tired to cook or just can&apos;t be bothered you have a ready made meal that just needs heating through. If you have time to wash them cloth nappies save alot of money,( this isn&apos;t an option for me, my 9 month old saturates a disposable in less than an hour).
