 If you traveling on I-75 and want to have sandwiches for lunch, Yoder&apos;s Sandwich Shoppe is a good choice. It has a 
 nice selection of sandwiches including pimento 
cheese, BLTs, panini, Cubans, etc. A sign inside gives notice that this is not a 
fast food restaurant, so you can expect a short wait while your sandwich is 
prepared. This is good because Yoder&apos;s Sandwich Shoppe will custom-make your 
sandwich as you wish. 

 Soup 
 and salads are also available. A kid&apos;s menu features grilled cheese, PB&amp;J, 
 and hot dogs. Good homemade desserts include cookies, 
 cake, and cupcakes. Most of the desserts are sitting 
on the counter in plastic containers near the cash register, so it is easy to 
pick up one of the way out to eat later 
 
 Directions: Yoder&apos;s Sandwich Shoppe is in the Perry Plaza on 
 U.S. Highway 41 just a short distance north of 
 downtown Perry ( i.e. only about 1/4 mile from Main 
 St.).
