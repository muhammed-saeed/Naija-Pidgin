I have to give a shout-out to my favorite burger place in college, Jimmy Dean&apos;s on Lyons. I was recently in the area and I stopped by and wiggled my way into the awkward drive thru that you can really only access from the east, and ordered a legit burger that doesn&apos;t feel fast foody. Just a little fresher and... I guess un-assembly line? More TLC go into these burgers than a fast food place. A little more cash than MCDs, but waaaay better.

Also, breakfast burritos with eggs, chili, cheese, and hash browns were a weekend staple for me.

But, the clear highlight and front runner at Jimmy Dean&apos;s is Orange Bang! I&apos;m a huge orange cream guy, and Orange Bang! is a non-carbonated orange drink that is whipped as it is dispensed into your cup, giving it a creamy feel as it goes down. Many a times I would grab a large Orange Bang! with no ice, put it in my fridge, and polish it off through the next few days. It&apos;s not a Jimmy Dean&apos;s exclusive product, but this is the only place that carries it that I knew of, and the other business followed.

The burgers at this joint are some of the most incredible I&apos;ve had. They always come out fresh and delicious.

Breakfast burritos? The best breakfast burrito this side of Tarzana. (okay, I couldn&apos;t think of an eastern city.)

However, minus 1 star for the archaic practices when it comes to currency. Cash only? What are you? A broke ass crepes truck? No? Than step up your VISA game Jimmy.

I was immediately put off by the decor and poorly designed drive-thru. It&apos;s a parking lot nightmare at lunch time. But as was suggested to me by a friend, I tried the chicken sandwich and...... WOW. It was really good. They have a really extensive menu.
I wish they would upgrade their appearance.

Breakfast burritos are pretty good. They are not Cottage Corner-Burbank great but they are good. If you ever had those Cottage Corner burritos you will know what I&apos;m talking about. The Charbroiled Burgers are pretty bomb. The Chicken Sandwich was also very good. Overall the food is fresh and cooked to order.

Service is okay.  Food, especially breakfast can be great, but the real magic is the place itself.  It is a perfectly preserved fast food joint from the 1980s.  Worth the trip to have a shake and just look around.

My wife and I have always gone to Canters Deli (here and in Las Vegas) for the Rueben until we tried Jimmy Dean&apos;s. For the quality, quantity, and price, the Rueben at Jimmy Dean stacks up pretty good to the one at Canters.

I cannot say anything about the inside because we have ordered the Rueben as a take out. Everytime we visit our friends, we make sure we stop at Jimmy Deans&apos;s for the Rueben. We have not tried anything else either, so no comments there!!

Overall, good deal and deserves a solid 5.

After hearing the reviews about a killer breakfast buritto, this place seemed the cure to my post-bachelorette party hangover. My loving boy helped peel me out of bed and we headed down the street for the hang over cure.

We ordered and the food came out quickly. I was so stoked to get my nom on. But alas, it was not was I was expecting. It was PACKED full of hash browns. But no, not the delicious crunchy bits of goodness, but mushed mash potato kind. Between the tortilla and over load of mushy potatoes, I found this burrito too texturally challenging, but it wasn&apos;t just because I was hungover, it was really not good.

I ended up picking apart the burrito and eating the little bits of bacon that I found upon my inspection of the burrito corpse. Upon my dissection, I noticed that the eggs were super flat...almost crepe like. Weird and not appetizing. Good thing my Sprite was yummy...good ole&apos; fountain soda. I&apos;m glad I can depend on you to cure my over indulgence of champagne and cheap vodka.

The food here is good.  But the service is going down hill fast.  The girl at the drive thru lately has twice given me the wrong items in my order.  No point in ordering if you don&apos;t get what you want regardless of the great quality of the food.

I am a Vegetarian and I recently went here to get a breakfast burrito with just eggs, hash browns, and cheese. I got home and started to eat my burrito when I noticed a piece of bacon in it. So I opened it up and the whole inside of my VEGETARIAN burrito was littered with sausage and bacon debris. So I called them and told them what was going on and they said to come back and they would make me another burrito for free and they would make sure there was no meat in it. So I went back the next day and the owner had one made for me and when he gave it to me her very rudely said &quot;That was not meat you saw in the burrito it was just little pieces of burnt hash browns.&quot; now this irritated me because in my opinion in other words he pretty much said &quot;You&apos;re stupid and you don&apos;t know what you are talking about it wasn&apos;t meat.&quot;, when in fact is was meat. I am not stupid, I am a Vegetarian, I think I know what meat looks like. Anyway, other than that everything at Jimmy Deans is great and that is really the only bad experience I have ever had here.

High school wouldn&apos;t have been the same for me if it wasn&apos;t for Jimmy Dean&apos;s.

My friends from Hart High and I used to come to this place all the time instead of going to class. It wasn&apos;t because we were seeking some means of rebelling or because we wanted to fight against the system. It&apos;s just that...their breakfast burritos were just that good.

Give me a Jimmy Dean&apos;s Breakfast Burrito with a side of ranch and I&apos;ll ditch any class any day of the week. The BB is a masterful combination of eggs, cheese, hashbrowns, bacon, and CHILI, all thrown together within a huge flour tortilla. However, it is honestly nothing without the ranch dressing that is an automatic requisite when ordering the Jimmy Dean Breakfast Burrito.

Shamefully...I have yet to finish one of these mammoth beasts of a burrito. But I hold my head high knowing that even if I don&apos;t finish it...that just means more leftovers for me to take and eat when I get hungry again...20-some hours later (bc I&apos;d still be full from the same burrito!)

I love this place.  Anything you want, any time of day.  The pastrami, burritos, and anything with chilli is amazing.  Brings back memories of jumping the fence at Hart High and getting a breakfast burrito.

They have been here since the late 80&apos;s, so they are doing something right!

I have only stuck to burgers here, so I cannot comment about other menu items.  They offer an extensive menu of all sorts of things.

Had their charbroiled burger, which was wonderful.  They actually cook it by hand and even did it to a perfect medium rare at my request.  Many other burger places will only cook to medium well.  Their onion rings are the best.  They are hand breaded, and the bag is huge.

Major bummer is they are cash only.  Had to scrape change from the ash tray to pay the bill.

The ONLY reason this dirty place gets a 5 is due to their delicious breakfast burritos. Grab a spot in the drive-thru because you dont want to deal with all the high school kids (trust me, i use to be one of those diners), and bare through the agony of the extremely rude girl at the window....and ten minutes later you are eating heaven in your car.

ps. get ranch dressing. its a must. and if you cant take the size( it is large and in charge) they do have a small kids size.

this is one of my only reasons to go back to Valencia. well worth the trip.......once in a while.

Mr. Dean&apos;s has such a crazy extensive menu it&apos;s ridiculous. If I were ever umm playing with puff the magic dragon and came here my head would for sure fizzle then POP. Fajitas at a fast food joint? Shenanigans!

My buddy who grew up in the SCV took me here for the first time a few months ago. He swore the breakfast burritos to die for - literally. These things are loaded, ready to kill, and oh so effin delicious. Drizzle some of the best tasting ranch dressing ever and you&apos;ve got a fiesta in yo&apos; mouth!

I&apos;m a burger connoisseur so I can&apos;t wait to get my paws on some of that. Once I do this review will definitely be updated. But in the meantime I&apos;ll have to clear my ranch and bacon grease filled arteries.

This food is great. I&apos;ve been coming here since I was a kid. Breakfast Burritos, bacon cheeseburgers, Bbq chicken sandwiches, and fries wither their awesome ranch are my favorites.   A little expensive and cash only are the only negatives and the reason for my four star rating.

Perhaps the last of the real charbroiled burgers left in the SCV, Jimmy Deans took me back to the restaurants of the distant past that served the myriad of all things fried and clogging. I remember coming here 8 years ago and enjoying, of all things, a burrito and it was really good. Coming back recently, I had a burger meal that really evoked that nostalgic feeling of  the great decade: the 90&apos;s.

Everything was very fulfilling and... hmm... what&apos;s the word... yummy. Descriptively elementary, but they did everything simple and delicious. The fries were crispy, burgers juicy, and portions more than generous. At times, I find myself hankering for that all-American burger and I can&apos;t think of anyone better than Jimmy Dean to fulfill that need. Sometimes, I feel sorry for those spending three times as much thinking they&apos;re getting a good burger at Island&apos;s .

Growing up in Torrance we had charbroilers out the ass - Jerry&apos;s, Steve&apos;s, Astro, Golden Ox, Brolly Hut, and the all-time universal king of the lot - Y Not.

This Santa Clarita charbroiler is decent, with a nice sizeable menu that covers everything you&apos;d expect.  The burgers are drowning in lettuce and bun, but lacking in sauce.  If they switched to ketchup relish in large amounts they&apos;d have a homerun.  Burritos are HUGE, simple and awesome.  I love taquitos, and theirs aren&apos;t exemplary but they fit the bill.  Big ass servings of big gushy fries.

$5-$10 per person.  Average overall but a nice taste of High School on occasion.  3 stars.

As one of the founding members of the BBC (Breakfast Burrito Club)  I find it sad that I can only give Jimmy Dean&apos;s 5 stars.  The Side of Ranch itself can get 5 stars.  Webster&apos;s Dictionary has a picture of the Jimmy Dean&apos;s Breakfast Burrito right next to the word heaven.  This burrito was so clutch and got me through so many morning classes and saturday morning film sessions that I will never be able to repay the debt.  These 5 stars are for you Mr. Breakfast Burrito...w/o chili for me of course.

I found this place today while looking for another place.  I ordered  a double-bacon cheeseburger and an Iced Tea. The lady behind the counter smiled, and apologetically said that they didn&apos;t take credit cards, only cash. She pointed to an ATM and I started to get money out of it, the fee was 1.50 for ATM use. I thought to myself, &quot;F this, I&apos;m goin to CVS down the road.&quot;  So I left, and went to CVS down the road, bought a diet lime soda and got 10 bucks back.  What would have been an ATM fee got me a soda.  I returned to Jimmy Deans and re-ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and small fries. It was almost 9 dollars.  When I got the burger I brought it back to a table. The burger was pretty good, the fries were good.  But the no credit card thing ticked me off. The other downside is the parking lot is kinda tight. So, make sure you bring your compact car and your cash, and go have a pretty good burger. Maybe I&apos;ll try their breakfast stuff next time. Assuming I remember the cash.

I really don&apos;t see how having Hispanic employees have anything to do with the quality of this place.  Yes there are a lot of Hispanic employees but this place isn&apos;t run by Hispanics only and if it were...who cares?
Anyways...I do like the food here.  It is very good.  They have menu items that fast food places normally don&apos;t and they taste pretty darn delicious.  I love their ranch and blue cheese dressing.  The inside of the restaurant is always clean and my kids like playing with the toy vending machines.  What I don&apos;t like about the place is the prices and the fact that they only accept cash.  It seems crazy to me that any business in this day and age doesn&apos;t take debit or credit cards.  I have actually wanted to go eat here but went somewhere else because I didn&apos;t want to get cash out of the ATM.  Their prices are a little high plus their menu is so inaccurate that you never get charged the menu price.  it drives me insane.  I hate having to question why my food cost more than what the menu says and then getting an answer that doesn&apos;t make sense.  It feels like you are getting cheated.  I don&apos;t see why it is so hard to charge the posted price?  If you want above average fast food then go ahead and give it a shot, try the BLT it is amazing!

After a day at Castaic went to Jimmy Dean&apos;s for  charbroiled chicken sandwiches. This place has chicken, burgers, Mexican food, steak sandwiches and much more. Something for everyone. It&apos;s a fast food joint with excellent fresh cooked food. If I&apos;m in the area, I&apos;ll definitely go back, Jimmy Dean has very good eats.
