You remember the last time you ordered a burger or sandwich at your favorite fast food restaurant and they asked you this:“Would you like fries or a drink with that?”or“Would you like chips or potato salad with that?” 

This is classic“Up-Selling”at it’s best. You might even be at an electronics store buying a small, portable, electronic item and the cashier asks:“Do you need batteries with that?”

Again, this is another perfect example of“Up-Selling”and you can do it too even on your website. Internet businesses that take advantage of upselling are beating the pants of the competition right now. This technique has been around since business began and it has proven to effectively double and triple the profits of any business. As you can see by the above examples, the customer is already in the middle of a purchase, and the customer already has his/her wallet out. So what a perfect time to sell them some other little accessories or related items.

Research has proven again and again, that when the customer is in the process of checking out, the customer is in“BUY”mode and it will be simple to instantly sell them something else. Obviously this“Up-Sell”product is much different than a“Back-End product because a back end product is usually very expensive and takes a lot more sales effort and time to sell. I’m sure you’ve got some inexpensive product or service you could be upselling right now on your website.
