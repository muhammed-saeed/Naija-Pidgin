 McDonald’s Corporation ,  U.S. food service and restaurant company that operates the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain, McDonald’s. It owns theme restaurant chains in the United States and other countries and has interests in restaurant operations and real estate. Its headquarters are in Oak Brook, Illinois.

The first McDonald’s restaurant was started in 1948 by brothers Maurice (“Mac”) and Richard McDonald in San Bernardino , California. They bought appliances for their small hamburger restaurant from salesman Ray Kroc , who was intrigued by their need for eight malt and shake mixers. When Kroc visited the brothers in 1954 to see how a small shop could sell so many milk shakes, he discovered a simple, efficient format that permitted the brothers to produce huge quantities of food at low prices. A basic hamburger cost 15 cents, about half the price charged by competing restaurants. The self-service counter eliminated the need for waiters and waitresses; customers received their food quickly because hamburgers were cooked ahead of time, wrapped, and warmed under heat lamps.

 Seeing great promise in their restaurant concept, Kroc offered to begin a franchise program for the McDonald brothers. On April 15, 1955, he opened the first McDonald’s franchise in Des Plaines , Illinois, and in the same year launched the McDonald’s Corporation, eventually buying out the McDonald brothers in 1961. The number of McDonald’s outlets would top 1,000 before the end of the decade. Boosted by steady growth, the company’s stock began trading publicly in 1965.

The public face of McDonald’s was created in 1963 with the introduction of a clown named Ronald McDonald, while the double-arch “m” symbol became McDonald’s most enduring logo in 1962, lasting far longer than the tall yellow arches that had once dominated the earlier restaurant rooftops. Other products and symbols would define the McDonald’s brand, including the Big Mac (1968), the Egg McMuffin (1973), Happy Meals (1979), and Chicken McNuggets (1983).

The chain continued to expand domestically and internationally, extending next to Canada in 1967, reaching a total of 10,000 restaurants by 1988, and operating more than 30,000 outlets in 119 countries by the early 21st century. Growth was so swift in the 1990s that it was said a new McDonald’s opened somewhere in the world every five hours. Development on this scale was accompanied by criticism that ranged from its associations with a worldwide increase in obesity to the company’s unethical use of beef flavouring in products advertised as vegetarian. McDonald’s has long been active in charitable work; in 1974 it joined Philadelphia Eagles football player Fred Hill in founding the Ronald McDonald House in Philadelphia (now part of Ronald McDonald House Charities, Inc.), and it pursued programs such as recycling and other practices intended to reduce waste.

 In the late 20th century, McDonald’s moved beyond the hamburger business by acquiring Chipotle Mexican Grill (1998), Donatos Pizza (1999, sold 2003), and Boston Market (2000) in the United States, while in the United Kingdom McDonald’s purchased Aroma Cafe (1999, sold 2001) and an interest in Pret A Manger (2001), a sandwich restaurant chain. Global expansion has been a hallmark of the firm’s success. By emphasizing affordable food, fun, and flavours that appeal to children and adults alike, McDonald’s effectively became the most popular family restaurant in the world. ( See globalization .)
