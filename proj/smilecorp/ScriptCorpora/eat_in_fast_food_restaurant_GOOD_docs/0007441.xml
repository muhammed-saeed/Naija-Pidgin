 June 12, 2012 Likes it Great lunch time spot by Chris ( 19 reviews ) Paula&apos;s Cafe in downtown Cincinnati is a quirky little spot for a great lunch. Went there with co-workers while in town and had a great sandwich for lunch. I ordered fries with my sandwich, so it came with the chips and the fries and more fries than I could possibly eat. The staff is friendly, the service is good and the food is a great price for lunch. Get there early or prepare to wait as there are limited tables and counter space. November 24, 2010 Likes it Burgerquest the #8 Burger by Roth ( 103 reviews ) Went to Paula&apos;s for the&quot;7 Minute Burger&quot;yesterday. It was named as the #8 Burger in town by Cincinnati Magazine. It did not disappoint. Topped with balsamic carmelized onions and put on a bun from Shadeau Bakery, it was great. Super greasy, embarassingly messy, this burger is just as big and glorious as Terry&apos;s Turf Club (and on the same bun). Difference being that there is much less seasoning at Paula&apos;s than at Terry&apos;s. I know some people think Terry&apos;s overseasons the meat, well Paula&apos;s is the place for you! More meatiness and less seasoning lets this #8 burger shine! -or it could be the (glorious) grease running down your arm. July 29, 2011 Likes it love, love, love it !! by cadiaface ( 17 reviews ) went to Paula&apos;s today around 12:30. Had a verrrry short wait at the door and was seated promptly by the nice busser. My man got the cuban and i got the 7 minute burger with swiss. the potato salad was mustardy and delicious. my burger was moist and one of, if not the BEST i have eaten in Cincinnati. The place was packed and its no surprise why.. this place rocks. Im pretty certain Paula was going to every table asking how the meal was. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!! June 25, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by TroyRad ( 19 reviews ) Had a great juicy burger for lunch. The staff was friendly and attentive. Fries could be better - will stick with chips on my next visit. April 14, 2010 Really likes it cake&amp;soup by Bebedough ( 25 reviews ) Hands down, the city&apos;s best carrot cake sold as huge cuts enough to feed 2. And, the world&apos;s best chicken wild rice soup! Enough said...go, experience and then see if you don&apos;t agree...it&apos;s beyond compare and nearly a heavenly experience too hard to describe! February 7, 2012 Will someone answer the phone PLEASe! by Amy ( 1 review ) I really like Paula&apos;s food, especially the chicken rice soup. However, they should not bother paying for a phone line as no one EVER answers the phone there. It&apos;s very frustrating unless you know the fax number to fax an order in advance - and don&apos;t bother trying to confirm it! Seriously, it&apos;s a good thing they have a nice location and a loyal following otherwise they would not have a business. April 26, 2011 Likes it Worth it by faheypb ( 26 reviews ) Always good, gets crowded. Lots of take-out traffic. If there&apos;s a line out the door, you shouldn&apos;t turn away - it&apos;s worth the wait. Go for lunch on the early or late side to get a good table inside. December 6, 2008 Likes it by VeggieOption ( 143 reviews ) First things first: it took me ages to try the Garden Burger at Paula&apos;s Cafe because every time I tried to get in I couldn&apos;t get a table and didn&apos;t have time to wait for one to open. Plenty of people will wait, however. My friend Jennifer and I made plans to meet up for lunch recently and, knowing we&apos;d never get into Paula&apos;s during the noontime rush, decided to meet up at 11:30 a.m. and hope for the best. We were lucky - we grabbed the last table available, and within minutes the few remaining stools at the counter were also gone. After that it was standing room only, with a couple dozen people waiting around for tables and/or carryout. There is no distinction between those ordering takeaway and those waiting for tables, which can lead to confusion, and if you have the misfortune to sit at a table near the front of the restaurant - as we did - the crowd of onlookers waiting for your table give off a distinctly vulture vibe. Craziness for sure, but luckily the food is worth the... more» First things first: it took me ages to try the Garden Burger at Paula&apos;s Cafe because every time I tried to get in I couldn&apos;t get a table and didn&apos;t have time to wait for one to open.

There is no distinction between those ordering takeaway and those waiting for tables, which can lead to confusion, and if you have the misfortune to sit at a table near the front of the restaurant - as we did - the crowd of onlookers waiting for your table give off a distinctly vulture vibe. Craziness for sure, but luckily the food is worth the hassle. The restaurant makes everything from scratch daily, and the quality is evident with each bite. Their Garden Burger was certainly was juicy and flavorful, although as a vegetarian offering it is fairly pedestrian. More sassy and interesting is their quiche - which tends to fly out the door at an alarming rate - so be sure to either phone ahead for carryout or get there early. As well as the Garden Burger and the quiche&amp;amp; salad special, Paula&apos;s also offers a cheese sandwich - Amish Swiss or American served hot or cold with a variety of fixin&apos;s - and on Thursdays and Fridays their soup of the day is vegetarian. Thursday&apos;s special is hearty vegetable and Friday&apos;s is tomato bisque, with a cup running $2.95 and a bowl $5.25. January 22, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Poor Service by V.T. ( 1 review ) My main issue with this restaurant is the owner&amp;her attitude. I had been there for a couple of work sponsored lunches, so I knew it was busy. WhenI ordered on my own, I thought I&apos;d order by fax so as not to be a bother. So I faxed my order at 11 AM&amp;showed up at 11:30 to pick it up. No order under my name. They kept telling they had an order for Kelly, but I&apos;m not Kelly. Then the owner goes back to the kitchen&amp;was looking for my order&amp;yelling at her staff. This prompted one staff member to come up front&amp;actually glare at me. Then the owner asked me when I ordered it&amp;I told her I had faxed it in earlier. That created a very nasty look on her face&amp;she chided me that I should give them a head&apos;s up when I fax an order because the fax machine is across the room. Excuse me! How was I supposed to know that? She has the fax number prominently featured on her menu. Who would think to call&amp;give a head&apos;s up for a faxed order? Move the machine Paula! I&apos;ve never been treated like that in a restaurant before. No apology, no nothing. She then put in my order while I took a 10 minute walk. Don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be going back. August 18, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by MiniDavid ( 8 reviews ) Paula&apos;s 7 minute burger just won my heart over Zip&apos;s, Sleepy Hollow Inn, Quatman&apos;s, Five Guys, and (from Columbus) Thurmans Cafe. Make sure to get extra napkins. November 1, 2011 Likes it Delicious! by Caly ( 4 reviews ) Hubby said the 7-Minute Burger was the best burger he&apos;s had in a long time. My cold turkey breast sandwich was delicious, made with honest-to-God oven roasted turkey breast. Prices were reasonable and the service was fast and friendly. We&apos;ll definitely go back next time we find ourselves in Cincinnati. April 13, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it PAULA&apos;S CAFE by Disappointed ( 1 review ) I had a takeout order. The chicken salad was extremely salty and the pretzels were stale. Not a good lunch.
