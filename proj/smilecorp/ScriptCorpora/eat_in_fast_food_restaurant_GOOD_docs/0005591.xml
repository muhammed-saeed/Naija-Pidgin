Pre-Dining Strategies

 Never Arrive Hungry. 
Grab a healthy snack prior to leaving home or work. This will help prevent you from ordering appetizers that tend to be high in fat and calories. Always Know Where You’re Going. 
Select a restaurant that you know, or that posts the menu on the outside window. Make sure healthy menu choices are offered or special requests are honored. Maintain a selection of preferred take out menus so you can review your options ahead of time and have in mind a healthy choice when it&apos;s time to order. Skip The Cocktail Hour. 
Limit your intake of alcohol, or better yet, avoid it all together. Drinking alcohol can lower your resistance to tempting, high fat foods and can reduce your appetite all together, putting you at a deficit for valuable nutrients. Alcohol also effects the metabolic functions of every gastrointestinal tract organ, including the liver. Alcohol is directly toxic to many bodily tissues and has been shown to be correlated with an increased risk of cancer of the larynx, pharynx, esophagus, colon, lung, liver and pancreas. 

Decoding Your Menu

 Ask Before You Order. 
Ask about words you don&apos;t understand or if the item can be prepared in a more healthful manner. Request a clear explanation of ingredients and preparation methods. Your waiter/waitress should readily know how your food is prepared. Gain A Healthy Perspective. 
If you feel self-conscious about your dietary choices, or feel your inquiries are causing the wait staff trouble, rethink your position. Would you buy a book without reading the back cover to at least see if it&apos;s interesting? You have a right to ask questions about an item on a menu. After all, you are the one who will be eating and paying for it! Order It The Way You Want It. 
Ask for salad dressings, sauces and gravies to be served on the side. More and more restaurants are carrying low fat dressing and fresh fruits. Ask for skim or low fat milk to use in coffee or tea. If the menu item isn&apos;t pre-made, ask if reduced amounts of cheese can be used or substitute white cheeses for yellow cheeses in an attempt to decrease the amount of fat in your meal. Know The Skinny on Fattening Foods. 
The following menu descriptors are high in fat and should always be avoided:

 au beurre bearnaise fried au gratin creamy fritters Alfredo crispy hollandaise batter-dipped carbonara parmigiana breaded flaky tempura 
 Know What To Choose. 
Better choices for preparing meat and fish include:

 au jus boiled poached baked grilled roasted barbecued marinated steamed 
 Know What To Ask. 
Asking a simple question may lead you better meal choices.

 If the menu says… Ask… Breaded &quot;Is it fried? What type of fat is used?&quot; Broiled &quot;Is butter used?&quot; Grilled &quot;What type of fat is used?&quot; Seasoned &quot;Are any fats used to season this?&quot; Specially prepared &quot;What exactly does this mean?&quot; 
 Life In The Fast Lane. 
There are going to be times when it is most convenient to visit a fast food restaurant. The main nutritional concerns with fast food meals are that they are high in calories and low in calcium, fiber and vitamins A and C. So what should a fast food eater do? Be Choosy. 
Before you step up to the counter to order your next fast food meal, think about what you have already eaten and what you&apos;ll eat later that day. Fit this meal into your food intake for the entire day and make sure to combine your fast foods with plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 

Tips for Healthier Ordering
