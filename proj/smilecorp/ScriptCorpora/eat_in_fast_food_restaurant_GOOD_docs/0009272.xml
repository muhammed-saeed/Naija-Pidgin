 Morton Street Restaurant and Bakery 
 

 
2210 West Morton Avenue  Jacksonville, IL 62650
 (217) 245-9600 


New to Jacksonville, the Morton Street Restaurant and Bakery offers an expansive menu, lots of seating, and an upscale appearance both inside and out.

The menu offers standard midwestern fare with a mix of American items with a sampling of several ethnic selections. I tried the country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans. I was disappointed since I was hoping for a &quot;knock your socks off&quot; dining experience. However, if I look at the meal a little more objectively, it was fine. The mashed potatoes were not what I expect - too loose - reminiscent of boxed potatoes. Ordering off the Senior Menu entitles you to a small bowl of ice cream that&apos;s quite good.

Morton Street Restauramt is a good place to take visiting relatives for a meal. It offers a nice atmosphere, good but not great food, and entrees for the most part are in the $8 - $12 range.

 Rudi&apos;s Grill 
 Grandma Rud&apos;s, a local favorite diner, changed location and name at the same time. Now located in Pathway Plaza, just east of their previous site, the new Rudi&apos;s Grill has lots to offer.

A new attractive menu has the old favorites and few new additions. There is a separate breakfast menu that is available on request any time they are open. Comfort food is the heart of Rudi&apos;s with local favorites such as humongous breaded tenderloins and horseshoes/ponyshoes surrounded by many sandwiches and entrees that just seem right.

Joining the Saturday and Sunday morning breakfast buffets are the new  lunch buffets which offer a variety of meats and vegetables that change daily and a salad bar. 
 
 
 The most visible change to Rudi&apos;s is bright and clean decor, greatly expanded seating, plenty of room between seating areas, and much larger parking lot.. The wait staff is for the most part a carry over from their previous location which means they are experienced, friendly, and efficient.  
 
 
 Grandma Rudi&apos;s remains a great local diner with the same homey feel in a new improved setting. Posted by Greg Simpson at 10:03 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post 
 Casey&apos;s for Pizza and Subs? 
 Gas station food isn&apos;t necessarily an oxymoron. &quot;Yah, who says so!&quot;, you might be thinking. Sure, gas station food and gourmet will never quite pair up in considered thought. But for those whose dining requirements don&apos;t require multiple courses and cloth napkins or those whose dining etiquette includes a meal in a moving vehicle, Casey&apos;s General Store offers some surprisingly good choices.

Homemade To Go is their slogan that includes a variety of breakfast items, donuts, sandwiches, pizzas and appetizers. Their subs are comparable is quality and price to the sub chains and their pizzas, whole or by the slice, are very good. An indication of their commitment to serving only fresh food is the fact that their by the slice pizza is keep in the rotating rack no longer than one hour. That&apos;s not the same as &quot;just made&quot; fresh like their sub sandwiches and whole pizzas, but pretty impressive for your local gas station.

Jacksonville saw a jump from to two to four Casey&apos;s General Stores in 2011 and the West Walnut Street, East Morton Avenue, and South Main Street locations are equipped with kitchens and provide good alternatives for that meal on the road or that quick &quot;homemade&quot; meal.

 Reichert&apos;s It Is . . . L.A.S.E.R.S Is Gone! 
 After an apparently failed attempt at an innovative menu from a creative chef, Reichert&apos;s in South Jacksonville has ditched their excellent Sunday Brunch and stopped serving lunch.

I have yet to try their evening meals, but felt it was necessary to note that there have been dramatic changes since my previous comments.

 Mobile Food: High on the Hog and Big Belly Barbecue 
 With thirteen food vendors at South Jacksonville&apos;s recent Concert in the Cornfield, it was difficult to decide whose offerings to try. With an assortment of carnival type snacks such as corndogs and funnel cakes to more substantial entrees such as a rack of ribs there just wasn&apos;t any way to make a bad choice.

My first choice was jambalaya from High on the Hog , a Jacksonville vendor. For $4 I received a bowl (and not a small one at that) jambalaya made with chicken, smoked sausage and beef in a well flavored slurry of rice and unknown vegetables. It was great. I have been told their pulled pork and other smoked meats are just as good, but I know their jambalaya is a winner.

Next up was Big Belly Barbecue from Carlinville, Illinois. I chose to try their pulled pork sandwich. It was more of a chopped pork sandwich but that was OK with me. They cook their pork without sauce and let you add as much of their homemade barbecue sauce as you want. I like that option. The meat was tender and tasty, it was on a big bun, and there was enough meat that after filling the bun there were several bites left on the plate. Thumbs up for a really good pulled pork sandwich.

Watch for these two vendors in the area, I think you will be very pleased with their offerings. Posted by Greg Simpson at 2:24 PM No comments: Email This BlogThis!

 El Rancherito 
 El Rancherito Mexican Restaurant
Lincoln Square Shopping Center
Jacksonville, Illinois 62650
(217) 243-1368

A longtime Jacksonville favorite, El Rancherito offers a wide choice of excellent Mexican dishes. I can&apos;t judge for the &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican flavors, but I know my American palate loves many of the items on their menu. The taquitos, chimichangas, and oh, those huge sizzling make-your-own fajita plates are wonderful!

The requisite &quot;chips and dip&quot; appetizer is excellent and for those who want more a cheese dip is available. If you have limited time for lunch El Rancherito offers selected items for fast service. Though adult beverages are served, this is not a bar with Mexican food, but a Mexican family restaurant.

Since being introduced to Mexican food years ago at the Blue Goose Cantina in Dallas, I have enjoyed many Mexican restaurants. El Rancherito, with its quick service, yummy food, and reasonable prices is among my favorites.

 CLOSED - Costs Little, Tastes Great! 
 The Three Star Diner has some excellent luncheon specials. Recently we had reason to be near the Three Star Diner at lunch time and decided to see what they had in the way of specials. The &quot;specials board&quot; at the entrance listed several tasty sounding entrees but we decided to go for the really low-priced special of fried chicken sandwich ( or a fat cheeseburger for the same price) and soup for $3.45.

The chicken wasn&apos;t a formed patty as I feared it would be, but a lightly battered, thick and delicious chicken breast on a toasted bun. I love chili but that day we both chose the alternative soup, chicken and bowties, which was very good.

In the day of $3 and $4 fast food restaurant sandwiches, Three Star Diner&apos;s fried chicken sandwich and soup is:

1) a bargain

2) a yummy meal

3) served by a waitress

4) in a comfortable and friendly environment.

All for $3.45. You betcha! Posted by Greg Simpson at 3:38 PM 2 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post Labels: jacksonville illinois restaurants , three star diner

 Norma&apos;s North Star Cafe 
 211 East Court Street, Jacksonville, IL
217-245-6037

After being without a facility for several month&apos;s Norma&apos;s North Star Cafe has found a new home at 211 East Court Street near the Illinois Theater. In a newly remodeled building Norma&apos;s adds another full-time restaurant to downtown Jacksonville.

I recently tried out the North Star for a Sunday breakfast and found the food and service both good and in keeping with a local cafe/diner. The menu held no surprises but had the expected home cooked regulars - burgers and sandwiches, several home-style entrees, and, of course, breakfast anytime.

Norma&apos;s North Star Cafe adds something new to the mix downtown and that is 24 hour availability on Friday and Saturday. Within two blocks of several bars, Norma&apos;s will surely benefit from the &quot;after closing hours&quot; business. There is also a banquet room available for groups or just overflow from the dining room.

Overall, Norma&apos;s North Star Cafe is a great addition to Jacksonville&apos;s lineup of family diners. Good food, extended weekend hours, and a banquet room for family gatherings or business meetings all add up to a plus rating.

 L.A.S.E.R.S is still Reichert&apos;s 
 All of the &quot;soon to be L.A.S.E.R.S&quot; ads have disappeared. Reichert&apos;s it is. Update coming soon since a new menu is in place.

 L.A.S.E.R.S (formerly Reichert&apos;s Banquet, Bar, and Grill) Update 
 
I can&apos;t help it, I am enamored with quality and variety of food at L.A.S.E.R.S. There are now offering a Friday lunch special of 1/4 pound Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon on Mashed Potatoes for $7. For $4 more you get a drink and your choice of several scrumptious desserts. Pictured above is the Cheesecake and Turtle Tracks Ice Cream with Whipped Cream and Chocolate. Definitely recommended.

L.A.S.E.R.S / Reichert&apos;s also recently started offering a Sunday Brunch with fresh fruit, salad, veggies and dip, assorted meats and vegetables, fresh bread, a waffle station, and a live custom omelet station. After my first omelet here, my whole concept of what an omelet is and how they should taste changed. With fresh ingredients such as green pepper, onion, tomatoes, spinach leaves, bacon, steak pieces, cheese, and more, expect the chef to create a truly delicious omelet just for you.

This is a truly unique restaurant in Jacksonville.

 Grandma Rudi&apos;s 
 
 2001 W Morton Ave 
 Jacksonville, IL 62650 
 (217) 291-0905 The old adage that“if the parking lot is full, then the food must be good”truly applies here.    A restaurant frequented mostly by locals, Grandma Rudi’s is located at the western edge of Jacksonville, Illinois and away from“restaurant row”where most out-of-towners congregate. As the name suggests, Grandma Rudi’is a  family style  restaurant.    Don’t expect anything fancy, just good stick-to-the-ribs Midwestern food.    Sandwiches, horseshoes, fried chicken, a nice assortment of entrees (yes, even liver and onions for those so inclined), lots of homemade pies, and Pepsi products. 
 
 If you are not familiar with the central Illinois take on breaded tenderloin sandwiches, try one here.    Pounded thin and then breaded, the huge tenderloin, at least twice the size of the bun, is a yummy treat.    Add fries to the order, and you won’t have room for dessert. If Grandma Rudi’s is open, then breakfast is available.    A great option is the Saturday and Sunday  breakfast buffet : scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, French toast, fresh fruit, and more.   Don’t be fooled by the full parking lot, there is a surprising amount of seating inside.    Grandma Rudi’s isn’t a late night hangout, but they are open early for the breakfast crowd.   Good food , reasonable prices, and friendly waitresses make this a comfortable mealtime stop.

 Szechuan House 
 
 1237 W Morton Ave
Jacksonville, IL 62650
(217) 243-3033 A longtime South Jacksonville restaurant, the Szechuan House has taken its legacy of good Chinese food to their current location on West Morton Avenue. Like every  Chinese restaurant , the Szechuan House has a lengthy menu with many styles of Chinese cooking from which to choose.    A lunchtime buffet is bargain-priced but the choices are limited.    There is also a lunchtime specials list whose price can’t be beat. My current favorite meal here is the Chicken My Fun, stir-fried chicken with ultra thin noodles.    Servings are always more than generous.    Their carry-out and delivery business make up a large   portion of their clientele and I have also been pleased with both services. Service is good, the food yummy, and the time from order to being served is exceptional.    The Szechuan House is not a fancy restaurant, but it delivers what its customers want–very good  Chinese food  at the table, delivered, or carry-out.

 CLOSED Three Star Restaurant - South Jacksonville - CLOSED 
 The Three Star Restaurant is in the former location of the Classic Diner on South Main Street (at the hotel intersection) in South Jacksonville, Illinois. If you liked the Classic Diner, you will feel at home here. Not the same menu, but similar in that it has a huge variety of choices, all-day breakfast, and is very good.
 
 They have made some physical changes inside by ditching the bar to add more seating but have retained the same comfortable atmosphere as the previous occupant. Even with the new owners and new menu this is still a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

 Barney&apos;s Pub for Breakfast in Jacksonville, Illinois 
 
 228 W. Morton Ave. ,   Jacksonville ,   IL ,   62650 
 Perkins, of course, is the place for pancakes and muffins and a general all around good breakfast. Grandma Rudi&apos;s (with a Sunday breakfast buffet), the Three Star Diner (South Jacksonville), and Weatherby&apos;s are all popular good choices. 
 But don&apos;t forget to try Barney&apos;s Pub for a  weekend  breakfast. Yes, it&apos;s a bar. But it&apos;s a bar with solid comfort food breakfasts. Large servings, reasonable prices. They kinda specialize in piles of food - the Haystack, the Stuff Hash Browns. Yummy! 
 Barney&apos;s offers good and fast service. It&apos;s not fancy, but it&apos;s very comfortable with lots of tables and TVs (just about a 1 to 1 ratio) and a breakfast you&apos;ll enjoy with a friend.

 L.A.S.E.R.S (formerly Reichert&apos;s Banquet, Bar, and Grill) 
 1852 South Main Street 
 Jacksonville, IL 62650-3516 
(217) 243-2420

The transition from Reichert&apos;s, a traditional family-type restaurant, to L.A.S.E.R.S, with an upscale and imaginative menu, is dramatic. The new chef brings many entrees not seen in Jacksonville including homemade peanut butter and jelly and waffle sandwiches, jerk chicken, and alligator burgers.

I have ordered jerk chicken in several Jamaican restaurants and I always enjoyed it. However, L.A.S.E.R.S&apos; version is simply the best, not only in taste but also in presentation. A great presentation is the norm at a high-end restaurant, but an unexpected treat in a $7 lunch special. The lunch special is available from Wednesday through Friday and its becoming a regular stop for us. The special includes a sandwich/entree, fries (regular spuds or sweet potato fries), and a drink. That&apos;s a lunch that&apos;s hard to beat.

Observations on some of their offerings:


 L.A.S.E.R.S burger - I saw it disappear in no time, my son says it&apos;s great. Alligator burgers - not what we expected. Its a &quot;soft&quot; burger, one of my sons compared it to a crab cake sandwich. I prefer my alligator unground in seasoned chunks (Cajun Alligator). Chicken Club sandwich - my wife&apos;s favorite. A very hearty and tasty sandwich topped with bacon and cheese. Philly Steak sandwich - the chef has a different take on this Philadelphia tradition. We expected the traditional thin sliced beef with peppers and cheese. Instead of slices, he uses thicker strips of beef. Very good. Hand cut french fries. Uneven quality, ranging from excellent to old cooking oil taste to undercooked. When good they&apos;re very good. 
 
 L.A.S.E.R.S not only brings us new dishes to enjoy but gives attention to detail that is rare: all breads and buns are fresh baked in-house, homemade catsup, mustard, mayonnaise, peanut butter and jelly. 
 Evening meals seem to favor the steak eater, but we haven&apos;t sampled those yet. Their currently advertised special of 2 steaks for $30 seems very reasonable for good steaks. 
 Still trying to find its niche in the local restaurant market, L.A.S.E.R.S is a great dining experience with prices that are very competitive while offering unique menu choices.
