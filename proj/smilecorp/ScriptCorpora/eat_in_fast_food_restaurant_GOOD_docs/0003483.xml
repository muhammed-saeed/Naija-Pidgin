Get a pickup truck and build a sandwich board in the bed out of a couple of sheets of plywood. Paint a message on the boards NEATLY, not some scrawl that makes you look like trailer trash.

Try to be creative and keep it as short as possible. People don&apos;t want to spend their time reading War and Peace.

&quot;Ask me about my lousy T-Mobile experience.&quot; is simple, short, to the point, and invites public inquiry.

Now, take the truck, with the sign, and park it outside the T-Mobile office. Saturdays are a good day to do this. Wear nice clothes and make up some handouts which politely -- no cursing, name calling, or identifying specific people in the office -- explains your problem and how they have failed to resolve it with known technology. Explain how the thief has further stolen from you and how T-Mobile is seeking funds from you to pay for the thieves&apos; ill-gotten gain.

They will approach you and may even call the police. You will possibly be asked to leave. You can get around that if can show that you are shopping at other stores in their parking lot. If you do leave when asked, simply pull the truck onto the public ways adjacent to the T-Mobile office and continue displaying your signs in their full view.

You can also drive through the parking lot several times a day to shop at other stores, especially those near their office. It would be good if there is a McDonald&apos;s or other fast food restaurant near them. Buy from the dollar menu and take your time eating. Keep the receipt handy. It will show the date and time of your purchase. They cannot deny you participation in lawful trade.

Several Saturdays of this should get you a response.

Also, drive the truck around town displaying the signs. Make sure they are secured in the bed so they won&apos;t blow out. You don&apos;t need a lawsuit for damaging someone&apos;s car.

Hope you get some results. itagents

Thu Nov 12, 2009 9:59 am  Hi

just a hint: check out Theft Aware - this is a tool that can help you recover your lost or stolen mobile phone. It is completely invisible on your phone and the owner can remotely control his mobile phone and perform a variety of actions that remain invisible to thiefs.

Actually - i wrote it - just search for it on Google 

Have fun!
regards

Fri Nov 20, 2009 12:41 pm  When I fist worked at tmobile we had a system that we could use to look up an imei number and tell every account it had ever been used on. They took it away from us (customer support) so we couldn&apos;t use it anymore. I&apos;m sure the program still exists but we weren&apos;t given then information to use it. So, Yes, I believe they CAN still find out who&apos;s using your phone but I&apos;m not sure who has access to that program and it doesn&apos;t seem that anyone cares. Once your sim card has been replaced they do nothing to find your phone or help with the missing information. Yes, they want to sell you a new phone so they get you under contract again then they&apos;ve hooked you. If you end up buying a new phone all the ringtones and downloads are gone and if you want them replaced then you have to buy them again, wasting even more of your hard earned money. The police can get any information they want, including the content of your text messages if they have an order for it. Sadly my experience is that when customers called back after losing a phone they said the police didn&apos;t help. I think they mainly do police reports for insurance claims. The police don&apos;t seem to check into a stolen phone unless it has something to do with a big crime like an assault or missing person. I guess they figure they have better things to do. Also, if you have the insurance on the phone you could get it replaced but generally unless you lose the phone in the first few weeks you get the insurance then it&apos;s really just a rip off. I don&apos;t have insurance on my phone. Many times people would have a phone stolen and since it didn&apos;t meet certain requirements then it wasn&apos;t covered. also there&apos;s a big deductible on the replacement phone and it&apos;s almost always a used phone and can be all scratched up plus you&apos;ve lost all your information and pics unless you have them saved somewhere else. Don&apos;t know about you but I don&apos;t. So the tmo take on a missing phone is you&apos;re sol. unless you want to get a new one with a contract. Sad but true. RaNiiTH

Mon Dec 14, 2009 8:35 am  on August 5th 2009 my purple/ultra-marine[?] sidekick slide has been stolen. It is a prepaid. Today, December 14, 2009, I am still trying to recover my accnt. MyTmobile accnt info has been changed. The fact is, the thief is still using my sidekick and my sim. My family and friends tried to contact me with my old number, when I spoke to them through my bf&apos;s phone said that they were surprised to hear a guy answering and assumed that I simply changed my number. I&apos;m upset. Very. The sidekick slide was a birthday gift from my bf. And that number has been with me since I was 4 months pregnant with my youngest son; who is now 19 months. That phone has bite marks from him. The flash microSD card is from one of my older phones[amp&apos;d]. I went to the TMobile store for the second time, since the last time I went was when I report it stolen. The thing is, I can not afford a new simcard, let alone another phone. Times are hard. My bf works in a retail store, and I barely get to work; due to me having a child and can&apos;t afford childcare. Since this guy changed all my info on my accnt; Tmobile said they can&apos;t do anything since the information has been changed. I look down on people that live off others, in this case -thieves. What can I possibly do now? That thief is not only using my phone, but my simcard and accnt! I feel so hopeless! I know I sound so dramatic, but you have to understand that I really don&apos;t have much else to keep in contact with my family but through my bf. That phone have sentimental value.please help someone! mpp

Tue Sep 14, 2010 8:30 pm  It&apos;s carriers arrogannce and unwilling to help stolen/lost cell phone customers. In other countries (eg India) all carriers share a common database of IMEI numbers and any lost/stolen reported phone is blacklisted so it can not be used on ANY network ever unless you show proof of owernership. The technology to use IMEI number to block and recover cell phone has been there with all carriers but there service is lacking. We need competition from foriegn carriers to get better service. And by the way - India has one of the lowest cell phone rates/min in the world.
