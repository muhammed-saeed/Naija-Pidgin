 How to Create a Water Park in Your Own Backyard 
 Parenting Squad Nancy Flanders 10 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am By Nancy FlandersWhy pay big bucks for one day of fun at the closest water park you can drive to when you can have just as much fun in your own backyard all summer long? Skip the car ride and the long lines and build a water park in the privacy of your own yard. Then put up your feet, relax, and think about your own watery dream vacation you&apos;d like to take someday. Sprinklers Sprinklers have come a long way since we were children. Gone are the two metal arms that spin in circles. Instead, you can purchase sprinklers shaped like a dolphin or an octopus. Hook one up to your hose and… 
 15 Simple Ideas To Keep Bodies, Brains, And Families Physically And Mentally And Connected This Summer 
 Mom Fuse Jessica @ Mom Fuse 3 Jul 2012 | 6:44 am The original post, which came from Mom Fuse, can be found here: 15 Simple Ideas To Keep Bodies, Brains, And Families Physically And Mentally And Connected This SummerResearch has repeatedly shown that physical exercise improves learning abilities—it increases blood flow to the brain and makes neural connections stronger. Studies have also shown that athletes are better at making executive decisions and adapting to different ideas. But that doesn’t mean that you and your family have to be athletes to keep the grey matter nourished this summer. Dive into classic vacation activities this… 
 6 Ways to Talk to Your Husband About Your Business (Without Getting Into A Fight) 
 The Mogul Mom Guest 1 Jul 2012 | 12:04 pm Does pursuing your business dreams give rise to nightmare conversations with your husband? Many mom entrepreneurs find that their business becomes a sore subject. At best, we wind up feeling vaguely unsupported, scrutinized, or misunderstood. At worst, we get in narsty fights with the guy we love the most. All because of this business we’re pouring our hearts into so we can express our gifts and support our families, right? I’m here to reassure you. I coach women on these issues all the time, and seldom do their worst fears turn out to be true. Fears like:“He really…

 BlogHer’12: How To Prepare And What to Wear 
 Beth B. 10 Jul 2012 | 10:39 am  BlogHer’s 8th annual conference will be held in New York City on August 2-4, 2012 and for the sixth consecutive year I am heading out to join in the fun, connect with my fellow bloggers and hear about the latest blogging&amp;social media tips, tricks, trends and strategies.

 GetUNREAL: Candy&amp;Snacks With Real Ingredients (And So Yummy!) 
 Beth B. 3 Jul 2012 | 10:53 pm I have a regular battle with my kids when it comes to candy. I always tell them that candy in moderation is fine, but I object to that candy being filled with artificial ingredients. I always tell them–sugar is sweet–why do they need so much junk in candy? When the UNREALTM team contacted me about their new candy line coming up (and hired me to host a local event, please see disclosures at bottom of this post), I JUMPED at the chance. Why? Here are the details from the UNREAL press information:“UNREALTM, is a new generation food company with an outrageous…

 PreviLean Chat… and I’m giving away things I can’t have anyhow :( 
 Jessica Gottlieb 10 Jul 2012 | 6:01 pm I took the ALCAT test a bit ago and the results came in Friday’s mail. Here’s a video of me opening them (and freaking out because I’m still not sure that a life without jalapeños is a life worth living). Part of the PreviLean package is nutritional counseling and quite often folks don’t start with their food plan/lifestyle change (it’s not a diet is it?) until after they’ve had their first counseling session. Mine is in a few hours and I’ve got two pages of questions. I don’t really know what a sensitivity is or if one recovers from them. 
 Dear Really Nice Orthodontist 
 Jessica Gottlieb 10 Jul 2012 | 12:01 am I’m sorry I vomited all over your office today. I noticed that you stopped petting me after the kibble and water and bile sprayed all over your hand. I do hope I’m still welcome there. Love, Junior 
 Birth Control Without Hormones 
 Jessica Gottlieb 9 Jul 2012 | 2:22 pm A lot of women don’t want hormones in their birth control. There are as many reasons for not wanting the hormones as there are people. I just don’t see the need to alter my body’s already perfect chemistry when there are so many other options available. Some women are offered tremendous relief from things like the birth control pill for those of you who aren’t here’s a list of non hormonal birth control options. Cervical Cap: There’s FemCap, it’s a latex free barrier to the cervix. Used with spermicide you’re looking at a 92% effectiveness rate.

 Once Upon A Blogger 
 9 Jul 2012 | 9:32 am Once upon a time, I was a blogger. [And then I took a job for which I had to blog... but that is a different story and I&apos;ll get to that later.] In 2007, I was regularly blogging and decided to attend the BlogHer conference in Chicago. I was nervous. What if no one wants to hang out with me?! [Oh, the anxiety.] I organized a meet up the night before the conference got officially underway. It was open to everyone. There wasn&apos;t a guest list. It wasn&apos;t exclusive. It was just open, real, genuine. And, as it happened, it was fun. We called it, The People&apos;s Party and, over the… 
 Whizpoppers 
 9 Sep 2011 | 5:00 am In Roald Dahl&apos;s novel, The BFG, young Sophie is kidnapped and taken to a land occupied by giants. Recently, I&apos;ve been reading this book to The Mayor and The Rooster. In the giant&apos;s world, their equivalent of soda fizzes downward instead of upward. Instead of causing burps, soda causes, well... the opposite, an activity know to the giants as &quot;Whizpopping.&quot; When a giant releases whizpops, he is lifted off the ground and filled with a sensation of elation. This is such a fun experience that whizpopping itself is a sign of happiness among the giants. Reflecting on the chapter where we learned all… 
 Hey, No Fair!! 
 4 Sep 2011 | 12:47 pm K usually wakes up the children, but he had to leave the house early the other day. We do it differently, the waking up. K plays an out of tune guitar and sings a made up morning song that might remind you of alley cats meowing in the night. I prefer to climb in my children&apos;s beds and snuggle them awake. On this particular morning, I climbed in with The Rooster first and rubbed her back and talked with her until I knew she&apos;d get up and get dressed. Then I moved into The Mayor&apos;s bed. Because relating to seven year old boys seems to require an element of rough housing, I didn&apos;t rub his back so… 
   
 
 The Tasteful Life 
 
 Eggs and Spinach 
 Carrie Pacini 27 Jun 2012 | 8:14 am Lately I’ve been re-thinking breakfast from the standpoint of sugar. This is a great breakfast option that can also make for lunch or even a snack. It’s tasty, healthy and easy to pull together. I like to boil my eggs to be a little soft. Here are some guidelines you can try. Soft Boiled Egg Cooking Times If you are using large eggs, cook the eggs for 4 minutes, for a runny yolk and 6 minutes for a medium-boiled egg, where the yolk is only slightly runny. NOTE: For medium sized eggs, reduce these cooking times by one minute. For Extra large eggs, add on one minute. Hard Boiled… 
 Pure Bliss: Mexican Chocolate Cake 
 Carrie Pacini 25 Jun 2012 | 5:30 am My mother has made this cake for over 50 years. I have two older brother’s Chris and Curtis who love this cake. They have fond memories as children, especially the time mom added salt instead of sugar. Curtis can still make the face when he describes that moment of taking that bite. My brothers and I are 11 and 12 years apart so once I came along this cake was made less because my mom went to work in order to help put us through private school. Our neighborhood did not have good public schools and was considered a rough area. The cake was still around but just not made every Sunday but… 
 Insalata Caprese with Prosciutto + Arugula 
 Carrie Pacini 19 Jun 2012 | 11:20 am There are times when I want something light to eat for dinner because we’ve had a big lunch. This version of Insalata Carprese is fresh and flavorful. To add a bit more substance I layer thin sheets of prosciutto di parma and toss it with fresh arugula. I also add a bit of lemon to the mix and toss with olive oil. There’s so much flavor with the combination of tomatoes, arugula, mozzarella di bufala, and the proscuitto di parma. Its nice to warm up a baguette of bread and pour yourself a glass of good Tuscan Red wine. Servings: 2 Insalata Caprese with Prosciutto di Parma and…

 Blogging Nostalgic 
 Shannon akaMonty 27 Jun 2012 | 4:26 pm See, I have had a whole post in my head for weeks (only I&apos;m mostly too lazy to actually, you know, TYPE it because I type type type type type for my job) about missing blogging. Oh, I know people still do it, some are still successful with it, even I do it sometimes... but I mean five or six years ago before the world Moved On and blogging became more about Making Money and Social Media. Before conferences actually had WHOLE SESSIONS devoted to teaching you how to answer &quot;What&apos;s Your Blog About?&quot; in the time it takes for an elevator ride (no kidding. ACTUAL SESSIONS.). **which, by the way, is… 
 Seriously, people are pissing me off. 
 Shannon akaMonty 20 Jun 2012 | 12:45 pm I just read a blog post from someone who put the link on facebook, and I am APPALLED. It was something about a &quot;hate cake&quot; and &quot;making it okay for your kids to hate you&quot;. I&apos;m not saying I disagree with that part - celebrate it with a cake, do what I did and laugh and say that&apos;s okay, I love you anyway, or shout I HATE YOU TOO - whatever works for you. But what this 15 year old girl said to her mother was &quot;YOU FUCKING BITCH, I HATE YOU!&quot; Say WHAT? If you&apos;re a parent you&apos;ve probably had to deal with the hate phase at some point, as nearly every kid I ever met has been there. *I* went through… 
 A Post In Two Parts 
 Shannon akaMonty 13 Jun 2012 | 8:48 am Part one: If I never read the word &quot;breastfeeding&quot; again, it will be way too soon for me. (having said that, I&apos;m about to use the word about a fafillion times in this post) I am sick to death of hearing people bitching about breastfeeding, or lack thereof. Everyone is so defensive and contentious about the subject. And it&apos;s EVERY DAY. Be real, people. Just because you choose not to breastfeed does not make you a bad person. Conversely, choosing to breastfeed until your kid is five years old - while creepy and sort of gross in my opinion, also does not make you a bad person. WHAT I FAIL TO…

 Living List Tick – Drink A Martini 
 Karen 11 Jul 2012 | 6:50 pm Last night was the farewell drinks for Lisa as she heads over to Bali for a few months to work and I thought what better occasion than to buy a martini. I realise this isn’t a martini in the classic sense: I didn’t have to specify, a la James Bond, that I preferred vodka over gin. No, instead I opted for one of Rue Bebelon‘s famous espresso martinis–because what could be better than a sophisticated cocktail? One with additional caffeine, of course. There’s no contest. I sat on that baby for a long time, even sharing it with Lisa, because one thing soon became… 
 Oovie Movie Rentals (Giveaway) 
 Karen 10 Jul 2012 | 2:15 pm As is the case in many suburbs around the country, our local DVD rental shop recently closed down. I think many businesses these days can’t afford the rents to sustain the large, cavernous commercial spaces needed to house all those DVDs. Especially when smaller, more accessible operations are popping up instead. Enter from stage right, Oovie. We’ve been renting our movies from our local Oovie dispenser machine for a while now. Adam discovered it first, liking how they were a) cheaper than typical new releases and b) more convenient. A swipe of your credit card and you’re… 
 Living List Tick – Go On A Ghost Tour 
 Karen 8 Jul 2012 | 1:54 am I love spooky, spine-tingling stories; but I also try to keep a hold on my imagination, not let it get the best of me. I’m all for science and theorems, but there a more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in Horatio’s philosophy, as Hamlet said. All this is to say that if my life depended on it and a choice had to be made between sides for the‘Yes, ghosts (or energies) exist’or‘No, they don’t’debate…well, I would be on the‘Yes’side. It’s not clear cut, by any means. Perhaps that’s why I find the subject…

 Happy Birthday America – 2012 
 Aruni 4 Jul 2012 | 9:31 pm What a great country!  What great opportunities await.  What questions have you asked?  What questions have you not asked?  What help have you sought?  What help have you given? How often have you expressed your gratitude?  How many times have you forgiven yourself and others and reinvented yourself?  Americans, what are you waiting for? Happy Independence Day–July 4, 2012. 
 The Definition Of Insanity… 
 Aruni 30 Jun 2012 | 6:36 am They say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.   You have a great idea but you pursue the same path and talk to the same people who got you nowhere the last time you felt some urgency around that great idea, and then you wonder why nothing of consequence matters.  On the other hand, people who say“we tried that last time and it didn’t work”usually don’t try again because they expect the same result so nothing changes.  They get stuck in the thought patterns that there is only one way to… 
 The Business Of Movies 
 Aruni 25 Jun 2012 | 7:03 pm Good movies provide such wonderful and safe escapes from our daily worlds into world’s dreamed up by others or into accelerated views of someone else’s“true events.”They speed up the mundane and let you experience a gamut of emotions that people typically experience over decades in a couple of hours.  A friend of mine who has been writing scripts for years in Los Angeles recently sent out an explanation as to why the movie John Carter, which I didn’t see, flopped after much anticipation that it would do really well at the box office.  The reasons had a lot…

On the Carnival Breeze, there’s a wide array of dining options to fit every craving and taste. Here’s the complete list of where to nosh while cruising on the Carnival Breeze cruise ship. These venues are in addition to reserved dining in the two main dining rooms on board and the no-added charge 24 hour room service.

 HyattHouse starts off summertime with a splash 
 PhillyMama 3 Jul 2012 | 2:09 am What time is it? Summertime! It’s our vacation. What time is it? Party time! That’s right, say it loud. -          High School Musical 2 What time is it?  Summertime!  And, what with two tween girls and the end of the school year, you know we’ve been prepping for elementary school graduation, Space Camp, and a fun summer at Nana’s house. In the 48 hours between graduation and Space Camp, we needed to fit in some family bonding.   We could have hung out in our backyard – but even our wide swath of green doesn’t boast a swimming pool.  We could have clicked on a couple… 
 Traveling with a Teen in New York City 
 RollingMama 2 Jul 2012 | 3:48 am Longing for some uninterrupted time with our only child, my husband and I agreed that we needed a family vacation. Bribing is not necessarily the best parenting practice. However, the opportunities to travel with our insanely busy college-age son, Weston, are dwindling. So we made him an offer he couldn’t refuse–an all expense-paid trip to New York City. After consulting all our calendars, the dates were set and nonrefundable airline tickets were purchased. Choosing New York City was a no-brainer. All of us have been several times so no one would feel compelled to play the frenzied… 

 
 Adventures in Babywearing 
 
 Here ---&gt; There 
 12 Jul 2012 | 6:15 am I could write about the time I was still potty-training my three year old while on the phone with a dumpster rental and trying to figure out how I&apos;m going to get this house clean and packed and ready to sell and sold before school starts. But even I don&apos;t want to read about that. We are moving to Canton, Ohio. It&apos;s six hours east of where we live now. I do have a story to go with it, even pictures!, but also, see above. I&apos;ll get there. We are so excited, it was so sudden and unexpected and I&apos;m totally along for the ride.

 On Pause 
 8 Jul 2012 | 6:41 am Being open online is difficult when you are keeping secrets. I could go on saying something beautifully vague, but then that&apos;s annoying. I want to share the whole picture, because it&apos;s a good one. So, I&apos;m in waiting until then. And maybe this is a lesson, I&apos;m rediscovering the value of moments with a few special people instead of the whole world - who isn&apos;t even really listening anyway. I&apos;ve been in this deep sleep, plugging my energy into a physical and emotional and mental distraction with so very little return. Yes, it makes me feel special except for when it makes me feel incredibly…

 Jenny the bloggess 12 Jul 2012 | 7:34 am I just tried on an ankle-length bathing suit and when my friend (Laura) asked me how it looked I had to tell her I looked too fat in it. We have reached new lows, America. But then I came out of the dressing room and Laura explained that the part I was wearing as a belt was supposed to be around my boobs and then I felt fat and stupid.  Plus, I broke a sweat just trying on clothes and then I was all“MOTHERFUCKER, HOW OUT OF SHAPE DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NEED A REST IN BETWEEN TRYING ON SWIMSUITS?”Answer:  Pretty damn out of shape.  Then I moved one of the outfits left in the… 
 Seven years later… 
 Jenny the bloggess 11 Jul 2012 | 2:05 pm Today I had a video shoot for something I can’t tell you about because apparently publicity is bad.  I don’t entirely understand it but it was fun and at one point my friend Maile tried to do my hair, but as I was blow drying it I realized that I was in some sort of time warp. Me, seven years after my icon picture: A little plumper, a little more wrinkled, a little wiser, the exact same hair dryer, but all in all…still me. 
 Beyonce 
 Jenny the bloggess 10 Jul 2012 | 7:51 am Several people have asked if we still have Beyonce-the-giant-metal-chicken.  OF COURSE WE DO.  Beyonce right this second: Country life agrees with him. Except for the hornets nest inside his belly, which, now that I think about it, sort of works as an organic burglar alarm.  No one ever expects to battle angry hornets when trying to steal a giant metal chicken.  It’s much like the Spanish Inquisition, but with more hornets and less Catholicism.

 Adding to the list of people who are raising my children 
 Tertia 5 Jul 2012 | 11:41 am When I first had children, there were some people who were horrified that I (a) had to work and (b) had a nanny to help me with the twins.  They said that they just couldn&apos;t imagine having&quot;other people raise their children&quot;. Which is such a holier-than-thou, shitty thing to say.  Luckily I am ok with the fact that I am unable to clone myself and therefore do need help to&apos;raise&apos;my children.   As you know, the twins started Grade 1 this year.  Which has been quite an adjustment, for all of us.  Grade 1 is a lot more work for the children and also for the… 
 It&apos;s not easy being a pain in the arse 
 Tertia 3 Jul 2012 | 4:51 am I seem to attract people who are a pain in the butt.   My husband can be a huge pain. He is very&apos;strict&apos;about things.  Thing should be done right or else they aren&apos;t good enough.  He has a very low tolerance for people who are lazy / weak / entitled. He can be an obstinate, set-in-his-ways mule.  He is a pain, but I am worse. My good friend and business partner can be a pain.  She is very strict about certain things too.  She can be a stubborn, head strong, my-way-is-the-right-way pain in the butt.  But I am worse. Rose (our nanny) can be a pain - She is a high…

 dooce 11 Jul 2012 | 12:54 pm So this happened this morning: Piggyback ride, naked kid, dog wagging his tail. Good times. (In several years Marlo will find out that I posted this photo on my website and be enraged that I covered up her butt.) I found out a couple of days ago that my best friend from high school is getting married in the fall. I texted her congratulations, and because she avoids all things Internet-related she wrote back this morning to ask how I was doing. I briefly summarized the last several months of my life with mentions of the rattlesnake, the dead bird, and the crushed retaining wall because I…

 IVF for women in their 50s

Four years later, she had IVF again, to conceive Brodie.She and husband David, 62, both have grown-up children from earlier marriages but wanted a family together.And the American study confirmed what they believed all along — that older mothers have more patience and just as much energy as many young mums.She says: I often talk to much younger mums at the school…

 Svan’s Lyft Booster: The Coolest Looking Family Table Chair for your Toddler 
 Whitney 12 Jul 2012 | 4:35 am Honestly, where were these cool-looking booster seats when my kids were little? I would have loved to use something like Svan’s Lyft Booster Seat at our family dining table over some of the plastic, ugly-looking ones I used with my son Nate eight years ago. This modern booster seat has a sleek and urban design that fits right into your home and onto the chair–totally unoffensive looking! Plus you have to love that it’s a space saver sitting right on top of the regular dining chair. Other perks–it’s portable, easy to clean and adjustable based on the size of…

Hawaiian Tropic makes this Shimmer Effect Sunscreen with SPF 20 and here’s what I love about it–included in the sunscreen is a little sparkle.

 potluck of the tardy variety 
 Holly 10 Jul 2012 | 12:44 pm Yes, I realize it isn’t Monday, but I am throwing a Monday potluck anyway. I am just holding my breath that the Monday Potluck Police don’t notice. So, summertime has been busy. There are the usual things that happen around the house. Then the added details of camps, vacations, baseball games and swimming pool visit quotas. Oh, and there are kids at my house all day.  Everyday.  And they expect to be fed. Seriously. I declare that the words“summer vacation”only applies to those under 18 years of age. Almost every evening, my husband and I take a walk.  We have… 
 raising tim burton 
 Holly 30 Jun 2012 | 7:45 am How three boys who came from the same genetic pool and are being raised in the same environment can be so different is a mystery to me. What happened to nature?  What happened to nurture? I see it everyday in tiny little things.  Ryan and Rhett tend to think along the same lines.  Reid is drawing those lines into dragons. You see it here in the stories.  Ryan and Rhett are going to be lawyers.  Reid is going to be a janitor. For Christmas, the boys received a LEGO table {my DIY LEGO table instructions} and before noon Christmas day it had been co-oped by Ryan for his“city”…

Our master plan was set despite a several year pause in the pregnancy timeline. One of those bedrooms was waiting for the appropriate nursery decorations…Cowgirl. It wouldn’t be too girly, more a tomboy-type room.  Denim, red gingham and lots of western-inspired fringe.  Of course we were going to have a girl!  We were going to name her Samantha!  We were going to call her Sam! In 9 years of marriage, it hadn’t even OCCURRED to us that we… 

 
 Fluid Pudding 
 
 Iron Maiden is on my running mix. And you think I’m kidding. 
 fluidpudding 10 Jul 2012 | 1:58 pm Although I’m a bit disappointed in myself for turning Fluid Pudding into a weekly thing, I believe it’s fair to blame my silence on the uneventful summer. The writing on yesterday’s calendar space says“library, store, piano, knives.”Today is“coffee/knitting, root beer.”Tomorrow?“Henry Express Groom! FroYo?”(Actually, that one is pretty exciting. Because Henry has anxiety issues and this is his first grooming, I paid eleven dollars extra to have three groomers work on him at the same time. This means he will not be put in a crate at… 
 Tell me what you know about nutty buddies. 
 fluidpudding 3 Jul 2012 | 11:58 am The day is only half over, and the following things have happened: 1. I was trapped in my garage when a stranger’s truck broke down in my driveway. 2. I met a friend for coffee and knitting. 3. We got a pool for the puppies! 4. Harper said,“I think the middle finger is the longest because it’s the most helpful.”Darwinism! 5. The dead man in our front yard was not so dead after all! Good news! (Believe me, with our house history, the odds are against us having a dead person in the front yard. Talk to my neighbor. (The cranky one.) She’ll tell you why.) Next up?

After he leaves, the girls and I will be taking Scout and Henry to meet a new friend who just might watch them the next time we leave town. (After the bad boarding experience we had in the spring, I have become the jerk who refuses to leave town ever again unless I’m absolutely sure the dogs will be treated with respect. This afternoon I will decide if my suitcase comes upstairs or stays in the basement.) When we return to the house, another guy is going to show up to take some…

 BFFs are back in town! 
 Donna 29 Jun 2012 | 2:04 am Yay! My BFFs from Washington, Jan and Don, are back in Hawaii! After picking them up at the airport, our first order of business was FOOD! We visited one of our many favorite places, Goma Tei, for tan tan ramen. Of course, Book Off was also on the agenda and I bought my first 2 Blu-Ray DVDs (Madagascar 2 and Kung Fu Panda). Figures they would be kid’s movies, right? I can’t wait to see the difference in picture quality. Jan and I resolved to take a photo together for every day that we see each other during their stay, then we’ll make a photo book to commemorate their visit. 
 Preserving the Past

Fond memories of family gatherings are so becoming faded like the old photographs tucked away in albums. I recall, as a child, enjoying the company of uncles, aunties, and cousins—especially during the holidays. My mother always roasted a turkey, waking up dark and early to prep the bird and put it in the oven. When I awakened hours later, the aroma of roast turkey filled our home. It was heavenly. Mom slicing sashimi and Dad mixing the Coleman’s dry mustard with…

 Bite the Big Apple 
 Momo Fali 10 Jul 2012 | 1:01 pm In the ninth grade, I was in a public speaking class made up of students from every grade in my high school. This meant that as a terrified freshman, I had to get up and talk in front of a room full of people, including seniors. It was awful. It was also one of the best things that ever happened to me. The public speaking teacher made us tape ourselves and going back through those tapes is like listening to a butterfly emerge from a cocoon; a cocoon that said,“Like”a lot. A whole lot I never had a problem when I taped myself singing Barbra Streisand’s…

 Momo Fali 6 Jul 2012 | 5:25 am Today marks one, full week since storms rolled through and took away my internet. I love my internet. I work online, all my friends and family are online and it’s what I do all day long. It’s kind of like when you eat cereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner for five years and then, suddenly, someone serves you soup. You’re all, “I can eat this, but it’s not going to be pleasant.” If I were 80 I would add, “This is really going to mess up my bowels.” By the third day, you’re screaming for your Golden Grahams and when day seven rolls around, you would even settle for plain…

Well, except for the massive piles of laundry waiting to be done, the dog-hair-covered rugs which are in dire need of vacuuming, the sink full of dishes, and tree branches everywhere. Oh, okay, TREES everywhere. I am still without wifi, so I’m spending a fortune buying French fries at a restaurant where I can use their free internet. My random realizations: 1. The power always goes out right after you get home from the grocery store. 2. It’s kind of cool when you think of how it will bring everyone closer together…for about… 

 
 Single Mom Seeking 
 
 Remodeling my life 
 singlemomseeking 2 Jul 2012 | 7:14 am As my body made space for my baby, our contractors made space for us. It’s been quite a journey, from the elation and anxiety that came with getting re-married after being a single mom for 10 years, to the challenge of moving in together, to the dream of building our home together. It always starts with your foundation, doesn’t it? Then, you need a sturdy frame on which to build: Along the way, sheet rocking on stilts looks very cool: This is the first time in my life I’ve lived in a house with two stories, and for the first time, I feel my own stories coming together. 
 Back in the saddle 
 singlemomseeking 15 Jun 2012 | 9:38 am One year ago, I was cycling three nights a week after work, climbing some of steepest hills in the San Francisco Bay Area to train for our cycling honeymoon. I was approaching 40 and probably in the best shape in my life. Whew, last year feels like another lifetime, pre-pregnancy, as I rode the Grizzly Peak Century, a total of 73 miles through the hills, and cried through the last mile, my tears mixed with sweat. Anyone who has given birth (I think that most of my women readers here would raise their hands?) knows that your body doesn’t just, um, bounce back afterwards. Even if you…

With a man who wants to be here, a man who beams whenever he walks into the room and sees his baby, then rushes over to scoop her up. These same friends tease about the fact that my blog name is still Single Mom Seeking.“C’mon, when are you gonna get a new…

 Hair Makeover Request: Glam Me Up! 
 Jordana Lorraine 9 Jul 2012 | 7:57 am Rachel, A natural blonde, wrote in for advice after dying her hair dark and getting short layers around her face.  The cut is allowing her only limited styling options, and time is short as she has two young ones.  Rachel has beautiful, creamy skin, deep, dark eyes and cheekbones to die for, but how can we accentuate these positives while keeping her maintenance routine simple?

 Dye-Free in a Brightly Colored World 
 Christina 11 Jul 2012 | 8:15 am A few weeks ago Cordy came home from summer camp with bright blue streaks down her legs and blue around her mouth. I could already smell the artificial raspberry flavor, but still asked her about how she ended up covered in blue. &quot;We had popsicles at camp!&quot; she happily explained. &quot;But sweetie, you know brightly colored foods aren&apos;t good for you.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; she replied, &quot;but it was a special treat!&quot; And that special treat left her distracted and less in control for days. Sigh. When summer camp started, I asked about bringing in dye-free foods for snack time. They said we could but that…

Late June and early July can be expected to have plenty of sunny days and even times when the temperature spikes into the 90&apos;s, but this year seems to be the year of all-excessive-heat-warnings, all-the-time. Today&apos;s expected high? 101 degrees. Tomorrow&apos;s? 104 degrees. In Columbus, temperatures over 100 degrees are a setting on an Easy-Bake Oven, not an actual expected air temperature. The…

It&apos;s at the very end of Route 66, so you&apos;ll pass Luigi&apos;s Flying Tires and Mater&apos;s Junkyard Jamboree on the way. My advice is that you pick up your Radiator Springs Racers Fastpass before you visit the other rides (at this writing, fastpasses are selling out early in the morning and many people line up when the park opens.) Cars race to the finish line at the Radiator Springs Racers ride in California Adventure Radiator Springs Racers was, without a doubt, my…

 In bed… 
 mssinglemama 11 Jul 2012 | 8:04 pm Sleep has always been a touchy subject for me. I never get enough of it and I am jealous of people who do. I envy well rested people like most women envy dewy, perfect skin or thin thighs. You can have your thighs and your skin, I just want sleep.I used to dread sleeping.During college sleeping proved to be a difficult task for a girl who loved to party nearly as much as she loved getting an A+ on her anthropology test. And after college I went and got myself a job in morning radio which means I had to wake up at 4:00 AM every morning. Very healthy for a 20-something who was staying out until…

Deadline to enter 7/15/12 at 8:00PM EST.I read all of the entries to the first thrift giveaway and couldn’t bear choosing.

 Common Questions 
 mssinglemama 6 Jul 2012 | 3:28 pm As a blended family and a newly-married blended family at that, we get lots of questions from friends and near strangers. In no ranking order of popularity they are:1. How did you meet?OkCupid.com. I feel like I should send them a check for a million dollars. The $5.99 I spent clearly does not constitute a fair trade.2. Do the kids get along?For the most part. They definitely have their moments, but overall they’re already acting like typical siblings. We have seen a shift from blissful interactions (at first) to heavy fighting (right after the wedding ) and now–a nice balance… 
   
 
 Suburban Kamikaze 
 
 Tourist season 
 Suburban Kamikaze 12 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am You are not supposed to look directly at it. But I can&apos;t stop taking pictures of the sun. The natives worship it, even as they curse the throngs of traffic-clogging tourists it attracts, whine about the heat and crank up the air conditioning until icicles form on the Bahama shutters. Now that I think about it,&quot;worship&quot;is probably too strong a word. My point is, I am nine-tenths tourist by now, having left Florida behind almost six years ago in our family&apos;s quixotic quest to remain employed in the news industry. I still can&apos;t bring myself to buy a seashell or pay to… 
 We interrupt this broadcast to bring you an apology 
 Suburban Kamikaze 11 Jul 2012 | 9:53 am We are sitting on the couch when one thing leads to another.  He&apos;s my BFF&apos;s husband, which, technically, makes him my back-up husband, but still, there is such a thing as going too far.  I recognize this and I apologize. Did we mean to go all the way? I can&apos;t say. I think maybe each of us was waiting for the other one to hit the pause button. We had to know we were going to get caught. The Suburban Executive is no fool. You don&apos;t win  sculpted glass journalism prizes in the shape of beachballs for being gullible. She&apos;d taken apart far craftier schemes over… 
 Gratuitous 17,000-pound man Tuesday 
 Suburban Kamikaze 10 Jul 2012 | 6:03 am You cannot throw a wet Speedo in South Florida without hitting a hard-bodied man. It may be just a trick of the light, or possibly a Margarita-related phenomenon, but that doesn&apos;t make it any less real gratuitous. We came across this guy just outside downtown Miami.   You&apos;re welcome, -SK

 A Bad Dream 
 11 Jul 2012 | 1:18 pm &quot;Is everything OK with you? I have noticed a recurring theme with your postings over these past few months and I am starting to worry about you. Where did upbeat, life is great Aimee go?&quot; A lovely friend, who has known me a long time, sent that last night. I have been thinking about it ever since. Have I changed? I can pinpoint the day when things went downhill - the day my mom got sick, a very scary day in May 2010. That is a long time to feel like life is a fog. 
 Cell Phone Safety with T-Mobile in Denver 
 9 Jul 2012 | 11:51 am My son is getting to &quot;that age.&quot; I have been dreading it - but we have been having &quot;the talk.&quot; Should he get a cell phone? Some of his friends have one, but I pretty much had it my head: NOT UNTIL MIDDLE SCHOOL. We live in an urban neighborhood close to downtown Denver, and even middle school seems young - but at that point he will be at school all day, further away from us than ever before, doing things with friends solo... and not to sound like a helicopter mom, but a cell phone sounds pretty good in that mix. I feel lucky that T-Mobile approached me recently to talk about exactly these… 
 Child Chore Chart - With Fanciness 
 3 Jul 2012 | 3:34 pm Remember how Declan was going to do all these arts and crafts this week? Well, yeah, that, but he also needs to help me around the house. Not only does it build character - but my house is pretty much a hellhole, people. But, I have learned that my child also needs specific instructions - something that is hard to do while you are hard at work on deadlines before the 4th of July holiday. So, we came up with the chore board - and - oh my word - I think we hit the gold mine. He and I listed out the things he had to work on today, and decided how long he had to complete each task. Declan needed…

 Medical Advice Monday: DANG 
 KC 11 Jun 2012 | 5:25 am Disney Associated Narcolepsy Grievance (DANG) Disney Associated Narcolepsy Grievance affects children worldwide upon their visit to Di$ney World or other Di$ney franchise theme parks. Epidemiology: DANG usually affects the youngest sibling in a family who is often forced to come along, thereby missing critical naps that maintain their good humor and well-being. There is no gender predilection, and DANG is more likely in families where sleep affinity (and ability to sleep in stark conditions like sitting up at 90 degrees on a wrought-iron chair) runs high. (See: The Sleep Gene.) Thanks for…

 The 5-Minute Face: A Step-by-Step Guide 
 whoorl 12 Jul 2012 | 6:07 am I think this is my favorite episode of The Sarah James Show yet–mainly because it’s more of a tutorial-type video like I’m used to making.

 whoorl 10 Jul 2012 | 12:50 pm For two years now, I’ve tried to complete a 90-Day No Shopping Challenge at the first of the year. I’ve failed both times. (I made it 8 and 9 weeks, though. Doesn’t that count for ANYTHING?) The first thing I do when gearing up for the challenge is unsubscribe from every single retail/flash sale email distribution list possible. You’d be surprised how much less temptation you feel when you don’t wake up to 89,000 sale emails in your inbox every morning. It’s refreshing, quite actually. But here’s the deal. There are a few stores that I want to keep…

I can just plant a garden, grow some tomatoes, and perfect my pasta sauce! Or play tennis with the kids! Or make homemade popsicles! Or read a book in the shade while the kids nap….but sitting at my desk and typing on my laptop? Nope. Not so much right now. (Although, I’ll be back tomorrow kicked into medium high gear, I swear. We need to talk about shopping.) Palm Springs was a blast. We had some friends stay with us for the…

Values and priorities are shifting into place but yet there is still so much to look forward to…it’s a strange but wonderful pinpoint on this journey we call life. Not quite old. Not quite young. I can’t think of a better way to celebrate it than a great big birthday bash with all your closest friends. I have so much to be thankful for. This“midlife crisis retreat”was everything I wanted it to be and more. It’s going to be hard to put down in words what I want to… 
 The Fourth with the Niece-com-poops 
 SAJ 5 Jul 2012 | 7:39 am My mom brought my nieces up to our“camp”for the fourth. It was so good to see them and my brother and sister-in-law. Kinda made me miss Bug more but still so wonderful to have family around. Please forgive the blurry phone photo. My real camera is having some focusing issues (I’m going to have to send it in I’m afraid) so I’ve been opting to use the phone and it’s not really doing anybody any favors. Susan made us amazing food. I might have to tie her to her bed to make her stop working so hard. My bro. The two Susans. Well one of them is spelled with a z…

 SAJ 5 Jul 2012 | 7:23 am Rock painting is quite fun. The pens are a bit fussy but so worth it. You just have to be careful you don’t start talking with one in your hand and wave it about and splash white paint all over your face. It’s very difficult to wash off. I could do this for hours and I plan to! I’m sure I’ll be posting about this again. It’s just too much fun!

 Comfortable, Caged or Charged | What type of life are you living? 
 Crystal 12 Jul 2012 | 7:30 am TweetI’ll be the first to admit, I’m not a fan of self-help books. I don’t like reading books that tell me that I can have a perfect life, if I only do…insert wild and crazy idea that really can’t be accomplished…once again leaving me feeling like a complete and utter failure. But, I didn’t feel that way at all while reading The Charge. This book was written by Brendon Burchard after a near death experience after flipping his car at eighty-five miles an hour. The experience made him question everything about his life. I had never really lived before,…

I hate secrets, quite honestly, and you don’t know how hard it’s been keeping quiet about a special “project” I’m working on. I finally feel comfortable enough to make an official announcement and I can’t wait to share the upcoming journey with you! So, without further ado…. I’m pregnant! Although I’m not new to pregnancy, I am new to being a surrogate. This is my first experience carrying a child for someone else and I’m sure the journey ahead…

 Swimming Waimea Bay 
 lavagal 8 Jul 2012 | 7:41 pm Old Dudes on their SUPs in Waimea Bay on an overcast morning. In the 31 years I’ve lived in Hawaii, the only thing I’ve ever done at Waimea Bay is watch surfers, take pictures, and get my ankles wet in the foamy beach break. Yesterday I swam 1.2 miles there. You cannot see where the blue bottoms out. The boulders under the water are amazingly huge. Ripples terraced across the sandy bottom look much closer than they really are. In the winter, it is home to world-famous, man-eating waves. In the summer, it’s calm. Except this summer. It has been so windy and chilly this summer… 
 Why Mondays are OK 
 lavagal 2 Jul 2012 | 4:10 pm I doubt I’m alone in welcoming Mondays. Sure, it’s the day most of us go back to the grind. I even remarked what a pretty day it was shaping up to be while driving in with Carrie at about 6:30. Accept and embrace is my philosophy. Well, for the most part. Ric and Richard collaborate with food artist Laurie. Saturday morning I didn’t get to do my usual workout. But that’s OK. I broke a spoke on Thursday and couldn’t get it fixed until Saturday. John did put one of my old wheels on my bicycle, and I could have used it, so it wasn’t a complete disaster.

Real people who are married—you know–the people you know, the people you’re related to, the people your friends are friends with—now that’s where you get the true jolt when a divorce is announced. And it is a jolt, especially if you don’t expect it. I guess we all know people whose news of divorce doesn’t surprise us, but, it is still a sad day when we learn…

 I’m not dead! 
 Veronica 11 Jul 2012 | 4:05 pm You know that‘flu that’s going around? Yes. Turns out that it IS as bad as they say it is. Probably worse if you find yourself bridging the gaps between“high risk groups”(pregnant woman, pre-existing lung condition, compromised immune system, etc etc). Nine days later and I’m able to get out of bed for a little bit each day and while I’m still exhausted, I haven’t had to lie down on the loungeroom floor on my way to the bathroom (yet) today. Of course the day is only young, but I thought I’d best check in and let you know that despite all… 
 31 weeks 
 Veronica 4 Jul 2012 | 5:47 pm Here we are, counting down the days until this babe decides she can make her home outside of my uterus, rather than spending all of her time headbutting my bladder and kicking my ribs. I had a midwifery appointment on Tuesday, that confirms that at this point in my pregnancy, I am larger than I have been before, measuring 31 weeks. Shocking really, with both other children I was measuring 26 weeks at this point and everyone was getting a little twitchy about growth. This further shows that dates are probably inaccurate, as I’ve never measured on time or ahead for dates, ever. Not even… 
 So quirky, even our animals are weird 
 Veronica 3 Jul 2012 | 7:44 pm Last night I watched as our dog Maisy carefully slunk up to my desk, picked up one of my business cards delicately in her mouth, and walked past me looking guilty before hiding in the spare room. This morning I woke up and discovered that at least twenty business cards had been methodically torn to shreds and left in a neat little pile. It brings a whole new dimension to the excuse“the dog ate my homework”doesn’t it? We brought Maisy home from the Dogs Home almost two years ago now. She fit in perfectly–a quirky family needs a quirky dog. She’d been…

 Accepting Lessons in Rejection

It had been an on-again/off-again friendship with another eight-year-old girl. Oy, these girls. I cringe. They are madly in love with each other one minute, speaking to no one else, then someone does something or nothing, and voila, rejection. Why is it those sticky lessons for ourselves land right back at our feet as parents? I feel for her when she’s on the pointy end of that weapon, and I worry when she’s grasping the cold handle charging toward someone…

 An Early Childhood Education on Acceptable Internet Usage 
 socialmediamom 15 Jun 2012 | 3:53 pm Face it, parents. As much as you fret over the dangers your children might encounter online, the Internet and social networking sites aren’t going away or getting any safer. A majority of people now use the Internet on a daily basis, including very young children, and as such many schools have taken notice and included more meaningful Internet safety courses to their curriculum. But if your kids’ early childhood education program or school isn’t putting forth the effort to teach these essential skills—how to be conscientious of predators, report and not participate in… 
 Organization for MBAs Sees Increased Biz Hires 
 socialmediamom 11 Jun 2012 | 11:08 am The decision to study business administration is generally regarded as a savvy financial decision. Sixty-two percent of MBA candidates in 2012 had job offers awaiting them after graduation according to US News&amp;World’s Reports study on education. It doesn’t appear that how an individual obtained their degree is as important as their specialization. Individuals in part-time and “Executive” MBA programs experienced increased recruitment equal to the numbers being seen during the high of 2001. For those attending school full-time, the numbers were not quite as stellar, but…

I can&apos;t, however, find out when the Super Bowl starts. The Olympics?

Anyway, the past few weeks seem like they&apos;ve been all about project management. Though the projects aren&apos;t extraordinary, it&apos;s been an exercise in partitioning my brain to take care of 3 kids in 3 very different stages of life. There&apos;s one sneaking into pre-tween-dom, one newly 16 year old, and one headed off to college next month and I have to be very cognizant that it&apos;s the first time for each of them and I fear something will slip by…

 Renovating Our Trenches: The Big Deck Reveal! 
 Sarahviz 3 Jul 2012 | 8:21 am When we bought our Trenches over 11 (!) years ago, what sold us on the house was the sunroom.  Big, airy and spacious, it has definitely been the heart of our family living space. But having this room came with a price, for it was built over the existing back deck.  Which meant our deck space has always been limited.  Like with just enough room for a grill and one person to man the grill.

 Nancy Flanders 10 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am By Nancy FlandersWhy pay big bucks for one day of fun at the closest water park you can drive to when you can have just as much fun in your own backyard all summer long? Skip the car ride and the long lines and build a water park in the privacy of your own yard. Then put up your feet, relax, and think about your own watery dream vacation you&apos;d like to take someday. Sprinklers Sprinklers have come a long way since we were children. Gone are the two metal arms that spin in circles. Instead, you can purchase sprinklers shaped like a dolphin or an octopus. Hook one up to your hose and…

 Proper Care and Feeding of Your Wild Animal 
 Jennifer 27 Jun 2012 | 4:25 am Topping the scales at a whopping 31 pounds and standing at a towering 41 inches, Ella is a five-year-old mini powerhouse. Wearing her size 4T skorts, cinched at the waist so they’ll stay up,  she looks sweet and innocent–and certainly she is!–but dare cross her or *gasp!* call her“little?”You had better watch your back. Playdates and trips to the park are often interrupted by Ella screaming at another child,“I! Am NOT! LITTLE!”Hands on hips, her eyebrows set at an angry angle, and her lips stuck out and pursed, you could almost believe her… 
 Discoveries 
 Jennifer 26 Jun 2012 | 2:16 pm (photo credit: Flickr) I remember the thrill of the discovery, like I had unearthed a secret treasure. Lonely and isolated as a new mom, I woke up each morning before the sun and with the cries of a hungry baby, followed by naps, laundry, more cries of a hungry baby, followed by more naps, more cries, bedtime. The next day was exactly the same, as was the day after that, and the day after that. Of course, it wasn’t all bad! Motherhood was just…not what I imagined it to be. In boredom, I went online, clicking one website after another, when one day I read the words of a mother. I… 
 Crazy Stuff’s Been Happening Up in Here 
 Jennifer 5 Jun 2012 | 8:44 am Crazy Thing Numero Uno: About two weeks ago, I was minding my own business walking over to my computer sitting on the dining room table when I suddenly felt a hot searing pain in my left foot. An insect flew up as I hobbled/ran away, screaming obscenities. My toes and the joint swelled and throbbed, but after a panicked call to Tate and quick search on Google I discovered that I’d been stung by a paper wasp. The severe pain and swelling was totally normal! Fantastic! The wasp’s reign of terror ended when I found the largest fly swatter available to man, which was actually a broom…

 Summer Camp For Me 
 Carmen Staicer 11 Jul 2012 | 6:31 am When I was young, I went to summer camp every year. Day camp for a month - my mom worked there - and sleep away camp for at least a week. My mom insisted that my sisters and I go away the same week - really, can you imagine???? - and we really looked forward to it. We spent tons of time looking through the Girl Scout brochure, planning which specialty we&apos;d pick - I remember one year picking biking, even though all I did was bike around my neighborhood, and the last bike run of the week was about 30 miles - I rode the second half in the back of a pick up truck. I was so not the biking… 
 Randomosity 
 Carmen Staicer 10 Jul 2012 | 11:09 am That&apos;s an actual playlist on my iPod. Last six songs downloaded beautifully illustrate this: Kiss Off - Violent Femmes Shake It - Anane Beer for my Horses - Toby Keith Total Eclipse of the Heart - Bonny Tyler - This is a GREAT song to sing as you drive down the road with all of your kids. They are alternately amazed and horrified. Booty Wurk -T Pain River Deep - Mountain High - Tina Turner What are the last couple of songs you downloaded/copied/recorded off the radio on your handheld cassette tape player - Hey, I&apos;m not gonna judge. 
 And Now You are Ten 
 Carmen Staicer 9 Jul 2012 | 9:38 am Thursday was a very bad day for us. Riley had the stomach flu - and we had company visiting - thankfully, not at our house. Thursday night Emma came down with it - and Friday saw an awful lot of this: This is what a 103 fever looks like I was a bit upset about this, for, you see, Saturday was Emma&apos;s birthday  - and who among us wants to be pukey and feverish on their birthday? Thankfully, Saturday dawned like this: I feel so much better today, Mom! And then Saturday ended like this: My amazing sister in law bought her a cake - we changed her party to next week to avoid passing the…

 Don’t Get Drunk Friday: Karen’s Story 
 Stefanie Wilder Taylor 16 Jun 2012 | 8:52 am I haven’t been so great about putting these up every week. Sorry about that. If you have a story and you’d like me to post it, please contact me! Karen talks about the Booze Free Brigade board and you can find that here. Now here’s Karen: It isn’t my first “day one.” But I hope it is my last. I have reason to believe that it will be. I made it a week without drinking recently. I wanted to be sober, but I hadn’t completely given in. I left room for doubt, and all too soon I was back to the booze. I wanted to quit again very soon after I started the drinking back up. I… 
 That 70′s Post 
 Stefanie Wilder Taylor 10 Jun 2012 | 2:40 pm Gauchos, elastic rainbow belts, saddle shoes, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Underdog, Felix the Cat, Kimba the White Lion my list could go on and on. I loved the 70′s and have such strong fond memories of all things pop culture. I was born in’66 so I guess the late 70′s were my formative years. I walked around with a wide tooth comb in the pocket of my Ditto jeans that said“Foxy.”I feathered my bangs. I mooned over Shaun Cassidy, Scott Baio, Matt Dillon and Robby Benson. On my Babble blog I collected a list of my 21 biggest 70′s things. Go check it out and…

 Stefanie Wilder Taylor 12 May 2012 | 4:28 pm I haven’t updated with a new story in awhile. If you have a story that you’d like me to post then please email it to me! These stories get people sober! They save lives! In ten days I will have been sober for 3 years. I can’t believe it’s been three years already can you? I will write about it when I get there and fill you all in on how it’s been lately (good). For now, here’s an amazingly beautiful woman named Molly who is baring her soul to save yours. I don’t really remember my first drink, it was either champagne at a wedding when I was 13, or at…

 Pure Love Lavished on the Frogs 
 SusieJ 12 Jul 2012 | 6:01 am There are less turtles appearing in the metal washtub. We’ve moved on to frogs. More and more frogs ending up in the metal tub, their hands, legs and shoulders. By the way…this is a tree frog. He changes his colors to adapt to his surroundings. How the boys actually spot them, and point them out, I’ll never know. He’s in that picture…can you see him?

 What To Do with Newspaper Route Money 
 SusieJ 11 Jul 2012 | 6:59 am Arthur Spangler earned $450 from his paper route. He did not buy an Ipod with it, or spend it on an Xbox live subscription – not because those things weren’t available in 1916, but because he bought a factory instead. He bought a little factory in a small town that made baking powder. Too mundane for your kids? Soon, he added sugar. Before long, Arthur was making candy. Today, his company makes all of the Dum Dum Lollipops in the world, along with all of the candy canes in the United States. Ten million Dum Dums each and every day.  That comes down to 10,000 Dum Dums a minute. Not to… 
 We Cheer at Sunset 
 SusieJ 9 Jul 2012 | 4:22 pm It’s been so hot, and so dry for so long that I just wonder if the earth is just going to burn itself up. I wake up earlier for my morning run, hoping to beat the heat, and yet, that star in the sky bears down on me like an anvil. Afterwards, I dive straight into the lake—which is now as hot as bath water. Instead of feeling cool and wet, I just feel wetter.“How could it be that hot? How could you possibly be that hot at the lake?”We are…and oh, how we complain. The lake has become a giant hot tub that does little to keep us cool. We’re a bit… 
   
 
 Rookie Moms 
 
 9 oz baby comes home from hospital 
 Whitney 11 Jul 2012 | 8:49 am I got chills when I read this news in my Facebook feed last night. Some of my Bay Area peeps are friendly with Nicki Moore who gave birth to baby Kenna back in January. Friends and family tracked her progress on Keeping Up With Kenna. Born at 24 weeks, she is now one of the world’s smallest surviving babies. Born at 9.6 ounces, she’s now up to about 6 pounds and healthy enough to go home under the care of her parents. My heart goes out to all you NICU moms for your patience, dedication, victories, and sometimes losses. May little Kenna grow stronger and more healthy every day. 
 Activity #195: Teach your preschooler about money 
 RookieMom Heather 10 Jul 2012 | 8:15 pm Fellow rookie parents, I discovered a website for teaching kids about money and I wanted to share. Wait, don’t click away just yet. I realize how boring that sounds (“Teaching about money.”Blech). But really, I could argue that teaching your children about money is one of the most important things you’ll do as a parent. Now it sounds a little more interesting. And scary. I found this site and fell in love with the direct approach to dealing with all kinds of money matters in a way a child can understand. They provide a milestone map to guide parents on the path to… 
 How often do you talk to your partner? (Sponsored) 
 Whitney 10 Jul 2012 | 9:07 am Years ago, Heather talked about using a voice recorder to capture all the little thoughts with which she wanted to interrupt her husband Alec while he was at work. This was when she was at home with baby Holden, who did not give her the verbal acknowledgement she needed to feel validated throughout the day. (At two months old, he didn’t say,“Thanks for washing those sheets I just peed on.”Nor did he say,“What you’re doing with your life is totally worthwhile. I promise.”) After comparing notes, we concluded that I am not quite as inclined to need to tell…

 A Tale of the Third Row 
 The Mom Jen 10 Jul 2012 | 4:40 pm For the past 3 weeks, we&apos;ve been living out of the car.With late night baseball practices and 2-3 games a week, we were never home.Luckily we have a 7 seater vehicle.Yes, there&apos;s only 5 of us, but everyone needs their space.The tween won&apos;t sit next to the teen in the middle row.That leaves the 6 year old with the whole 3rd row to herself.And, believe me, no one wants to....nor is able to sit next to her.This photo is after a bit of cleaning.This photo may be a health code violation, so squint when you look at it.I would have loved to endure burnt legs on hot summer leather seats over the… 
 All-Star Baseball Widow 
 The Mom Jen 19 Jun 2012 | 10:08 am Two years ago my son had the honor of being asked to play in All-Stars for baseball.A group of boys that were voted on my coaches and peers to play in an elite tournament at the end of the regular baseball season.It was an honor.That we had to turn down.We plan our seasonal end-of-the-year-beginning-of-summer trip during that time and well, if you don&apos;t show up, of course you can&apos;t play.As boys got older and skill levels more competitive, last year he did not make a team. So away we went on vacation.This year, though he struggled the first half of the season he ended up doing really…

 Buyitdirect Smart Appliances Taking You One Step Forward 
 Elizabeth 10 Jul 2012 | 8:43 pm Just about every household owns a selection of appliances designed to perform one or several functions to help make life much less of a hassle. Without appliances such as a Fridge Freezer found at appliancesdirect.co.uk, you might find that keeping food and drink cool and fresh is almost impossible, and it might also limit what foods you can eat. Such is the ubiquity of appliances that life is unimaginable without them, but some of the newest appliances on the market can perform all sorts of amazing functions which could render basic appliances as we knew them obsolete.

 5 Easy Snack Recipes even Kids Can Make 
 Elizabeth 9 Jul 2012 | 5:17 pm Keeping kids full after school and during the summer months between meals is a full time job for harried parents and care providers. It seems like someone is constantly in the kitchen preparing food or cleaning up the mess left behind after feeding the kids. These kid friendly recipes can help ease the work load by allowing kids to prepare their own snacks with (hopefully) minimal mess left behind.

 Review–Michelob ULTRA Light Cider 
 18 Jun 2012 | 6:00 am When summer weather arrives, there is nothing more refreshing for adults than a cold hard cider. Let’s face it, when it’s time to relax from a hectic day at work or with the kids, it is great to reach for something refreshing, that isn’t the same old beer or wine. Traditional hard ciders tend to be super-sweet, which also means tons of calories, often over 200 calories. Michelob ULTRA Light Cider is different. Imagine a crisp, ripe apples, turned into cool, refreshing goodness at only 120 calories. Hard cider is brewed from apples as opposed to barley and hops for beer… 
 The Sky is Blue on Cherry Hill 
 6 Jun 2012 | 9:52 am There is a super quaint ice cream place in Leominster, MA complete with a round roof barn. Cherry Hill Ice Cream is picture perfect New England, where we visited one afternoon last summer. It is set on a bucolic hill, just check out the view. After enjoying our super fresh, super delicious ice cream, Adam and I laid on the benches to gaze upon the blue, blue sky for what seemed like an hour. The sky was deeply, irrefutably blue. Even with a pink solar flare for contrast, the sky was blue as blue can be. Recently, I heard an episode of Radio Lab on Color, where they show that the… 
 Travel the World on your iPad 
 2 Jun 2012 | 4:32 pm I resisted getting an iPad for quite some time, but finally caved with the iPad 3. And since then, my world has opened up under my fingertips. The kids are too old for interactive reading apps, so they haven&apos;t ventured much past their slew of kid-oriented games. Now there is an interactive app that is seriously for any age from 0 to 99 (or older!). Barefoot World Atlas from Barefoot Books and Touch Press is amazingly rich and full of information that is easy and fun to find. Dova has a report due on Siberian Tigers for school, so she immediately went to look it up…

 Free&amp;Fun Things to Do This Weekend for NYC Kids: City of Water Day, Come Out&amp;Play Festival, Bastille Day July 14-15 
 Stephanie 11 Jul 2012 | 1:00 pm It&apos;s another weekend of hard choices! Will you spend Sunday celebrating La France at the free Bastille Day Festival on the Upper East Side or enjoying Wave Hill&apos;s free Mow-Down Hoedown in the Bronx? Your Saturday decision may be a little easier since two of our top picks, the annual City of Water of Day fest and the first-ever Come Out&amp;Play Family Field Day, both take place on Governors Island (and they&apos;re also both free). Or maybe you prefer to move and groove at Lincoln Center&apos;s Midsummer Night Swing Kids Dance or the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival’s Family Day? If…

The New York Aquarium’s new exhibit, A-Maze-Ing Water, aims to change that by inviting kids to learn fascinating facts about the water cycle and why water conservation is such a serious matter. The 1,500-square-foot exhibition presents the water cycle as an interactive maze that has children speeding on a kid-size zip line and spinning a roulette wheel to navigate the twists and turns on their path, all…

Unless she tells you first, don’t ever assume that someone is pregnant. EVER. EVERRRRRR! B. No, we would not be having another baby anytime soon. (or everrrrr) C. mommy is just fat. Sigh.

 workoutmommy 2 Jul 2012 | 11:29 am How many times have I said that to myself over the past few weeks?!   (a million?) It goes a long way, it really does.   Filling my lungs with air….exhaling….feeling the weight drop from my shoulders…..reminds me yet again that I need to get back to yoga class. There is something to be said about being able to quiet your mind and simply focus inward.  Have you tried it? Before I had kids, yoga was part of my daily routine which is actually kind of ironic.  My life wasn’t very stressful back then! These days,  I need a daily dose of LA yoga,  along with a side…

Ditto the happy river swimming, the raucous fireworks joy (with no ear-covering or fretting about noises), and on and on it goes. I wish I could go back and tell myself, don’t worry. Don’t be so hard on him. Don’t be so hard on yourself, either. He just needs a little time. All&amp;… 
 2.5 hours to paradise 
 Linda 2 Jul 2012 | 4:29 pm One of our very favorite places to go is the Rogue River in southwestern Oregon. It was in 2010 that JB and I were on the river trail and said, this is it. We have to move. We have to get closer to all this. We camped there last summer, and it felt a million miles from Seattle. In a good way while we were there, of course, and in a sad, frustrating way once we were home. It used to take us about nine hours to get to Galice, where the wild section of the Rogue starts. Now it takes 2.5. We drove there last weekend, camped for two nights, and came home on Sunday. Easy-peasy. We can do this any…

Now the hard part: The sellers still need to clear out, ah, quite a bit of stuff, obviously, and we need to think about what updates we want to make before we move in. Painting for sure, and possibly the flooring in a couple rooms. Longer term projects include the sun room—keep it? Maybe get rid of it in favor of a deck?—and the gloomy paneled living room that could have a wonderfully vaulted ceiling if we ripped out the existing…

 Summer Beauty Tips 
 Renée aka Mekhismom 10 Jul 2012 | 9:01 pm Although we are in the thick of Summer, I still wear make up. I keep it light and simple so when I was asked to try several beauty products from Olay and CoverGirl I jumped at the chance to see if they&apos;d hold up to my requirements for Summertime beauty. Check out my video for my full review of the products sent to me by Walmart. Disclosure: I am a Walmart mom and was provided with products/compensation for this post. All opinions are my own.  
 Shrimp Pizza cheeseless 
 Renée aka Mekhismom 10 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am Although I don&apos;t frequently brag about the food I prepare (except for sweet potato pie, I am a BEAST) I have to say that this shrimp pizza looks as good as it tastes! I was sent an Ital frozen pizza crust from Walmart ($5.99 for two) and challenged to make a recipe utilizing the crust. I am a fan of pizza but diary and I don&apos;t really agree (I&apos;m lactose intolerant) so I decided to make a cheese-less pizza. I looked around on the internet for ideas and saw caramelized onions used in a recipe. It was a lightbulb moment! I knew I had to make some for my pizza. I started with one white onion and… 
 Fruit Salad Mid Morning Snack 
 Renée aka Mekhismom 9 Jul 2012 | 8:55 am One of my favorite things about the summer is the abundance of fresh seasonal fruits. I keep an ample amount of fruit for snacking in my refrigerator for snacking. Although I haven&apos;t been great about food journaling and planning lately, I have decided that I need to get on the ball. I started my day with a three mile run and my breakfast, although unconventional was packed with protein, a few carbs and veggies. I know that eating at least five times a day will keep my metabolism revved up so I ventured into my kitchen for a snack. I saw a great red, white and blue fruit cake recipe on…

 A Lesson That Will Surely Come Back to Bite Me 
 The Dalai Mama 28 Jun 2012 | 8:21 am Another episode of“I totally rock at this parenting thing.”otherwise known as“Things I will certainly regret as my children grow.”This summer we got summer passes to a pool near our house.  We did this last year (at a different pool) and the kids loved it and we loved it.  It’s nice to be able to go to the pool and hang out–especially as the kids get older and more independent. So, this pool, has a diving board and a slide.  For the slide you need to be the dreaded and ever-elusive 48″tall.  Noah is certain he is never going to be 48″… 
 A Hole That Can’t Be Filled 
 The Dalai Mama 20 Jun 2012 | 2:32 pm I just found out today that Wanna/Layla House is closing.  This is the only home in Ethiopia that my children have known.  It is the one piece of their early history that they share.  It is the only tangible place they can connect to.  It is where we planned to take them to volunteer for summers in high school.  It is where I wanted my children to spend a gap year between high school and college.  But it will no longer exist.  It will no longer be the children’s home it was. Adoption has changed in Ethiopia.  The structure of how children are cared for has changed.  When we… 
 If Only I Could Bottle It 
 The Dalai Mama 14 Jun 2012 | 10:51 am I don’t know where my kids get their energy from.  I get tired just watching them–hell, who am I kidding, I’m tired just thinking about it.  Case in point–Tuesday–Noah woke up at 7 am (which is actually sleeping in for him) went to camp from 9-12, went to Grant’s Farm, came home and played, rode his bike, went to gymnastics to 2 hours, came home rode his bike again, played soccer and wasn’t ready for bed until 9. Seriously? His sister isn’t any better–seriously, she is worse; she can’t even sit still.  She must hop, jump, shake,…

 Live A Little - Get Moving 
 9 Jul 2012 | 4:02 pm I loathe sweating. This is one of the reasons I have always clutched to when I try to weasel my way out of exercise. I hate rivulets of sweat dripping down my face, into my eyes. I hate it leaving damp marks across my bra line and butt crack. I hate feeling red-faced and out of breath. Okay. That said, I have to admit that the aftermath of sweating is good. Post-shower, glowing skin, pumping heart rate, building muscle, losing weight. So for this week&apos;s Live A Little, I encourage you to find your own way to be active: take a walk, do an exercise video, try that yoga class. You might dread it… 

 
 Motherhood Uncensored 
 
 I&apos;ve been writing. In my head. 
 Motherhooduncensored 9 Jul 2012 | 10:54 am My head is filled with all sorts of things I want to tell you, but none of them are anything I want memorialized in print, cached on Google forever. I think about it at the early hours of the morning when I can&apos;t sleep. When half the kids are napping and the others are staring blankly at computer screens like me. When I should be running and instead I&apos;m stuffing my face with more birthday cake. I wonder if I could pretend to write what I want say like it&apos;s someone else&apos;s story. And then I tell myself that&apos;s stupid...

 Motherhooduncensored 29 Jun 2012 | 8:24 am Today I got an email for an open casting call for extras for&quot;The Internship,&quot;a movie with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn being filmed here in Atlanta. And while I had missed the actual in-person call, since they were taking email submissions, I figured it couldn&apos;t hurt to send a few pics, adjust my weight (ahem), and see what happened. Now they were casting for geeky/nerdy types, which basically means they toss a pair of dark glasses on the people, put a pocket protector in their pocket, and take a couple of pictures. Then if they need a warm... 
   
 
 Cool Mom Picks 
 
 Turning baby clothes into a quilt. Or better, having someone talented do it for you. 
 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am If you&apos;re like me, then you&apos;ve got a couple of boxes in the attic with a few of each of your kids&apos; baby clothes. Every now and then I wonder what exactly I&apos;m going to do with them when I pull them out in ten years and they&apos;re all dusty and mildewy. 
 Ice Cream Sundaes - 5 sensational recipes for summer

 Summer shampoos just for kids (and their paraben-averse parents)

 Attack of the Redneck Mommy 
 
 How To Survive a Heat Wave 
 Redneck Mommy 10 Jul 2012 | 10:31 am You know how you put on a bikini top only to notice your boobs are drooping so you untie the bikini behind your neck and retie it so tight that it feels like you are slowly trying to garrote the back of your neck with the polyester-cotton blend bikini strings all in the hope your girls are hoisted just a bit higher than that place above your belly button where they were just sitting a moment ago? Ya. Welcome to summer. The time of year when you notice your boobs are dropping like a baby boy’s testicles should. What my life can may end up looking like soon. Only with less sand and more… 
 Laziness is Hard Work 
 Redneck Mommy 5 Jul 2012 | 12:16 pm My husband left for work because apparently we have bills that need to be paid and all the Canadian Tire money I’ve been hoarding for the past 15 years won’t go very far in covering our debt. Or so say’s my husband. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t really know what he’s talking about because he’s never actually tried paying our mortgage or any of our utility bills with the wildly coloured Canadian Tire money. I think he’s talking out his arse cheeks without any actual evidence to support his claims. He’d make a lousy scientist. See? I’m… 
 One Man’s Dream Is Another Woman’s Nightmare 
 Redneck Mommy 3 Jul 2012 | 11:06 am It’s happening. The ridiculously oversized, mammoth garage my husband has been dreaming of for over ten years is finally starting to materialize. That’s the funny thing about dreams. You dream them long enough and hard enough, guilt your wife and spend every last dollar you haven’t even earned yet and POOF! Dreams really can come true! I leave for America and come home to find I had a popsicle stick roof. I was gone four and a half days. Apparently my husband moves a whole lot quicker when I’m not around to pester him with back-seat construction instructions.

 Spice Up Your Backyard Party with KRAFT {Giveaway} 
 admin 11 Jul 2012 | 12:51 pm The summer is heating up here in New Orleans and our air conditioners are working overtime!  To keep the house a cool as possible on hot days, we take our cooking outdoors to the grill.  Preparing dinner outside without the use of our oven definitely helps keep the temperature low in our home, not to mention makes for some fun quality time with the family! The Kraft Sizzling Salads has provided a new, tasty and incredibly easy dish for nights we decided to cook outside with friends and family.  Each kit combines a cooking sauce and salad dressing perfectly paired to create a flavor… 
 My Experience with the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club 
 admin 5 Jul 2012 | 5:28 pm For those of you that have followed this blog, you know that I began as“The Not-So-Blog.”In time, my blog evolved (and so did my interests and goals) so I decided to re-brand as“Experimental Mommy”because I had been a lab technician in a Microbiology lab at the USDA for many years.  Unfortunately, due to recent Federal Government cutbacks, funding for my project was cut and I lost my job.  After 17 years with a stable career, I am now finding myself at a crossroads. While I try to re-brand my life, I find humor in referring to my site as… 
 Redbox Summer Family Fun with Dino Dan and Vacation Giveaway! 
 admin 5 Jul 2012 | 6:30 am While my husband and I definitely encourage physical activity for our children, the summer in New Orleans can make outdoor fun next to impossible. When the temperatures rise, we bring the fun indoors and let the kids engage in imaginative play. With two daughters, most of the creativity centers around dance, art, princesses and kitchen fun….which doesn’t leave too much room for dinosaurs. However, this weekend we decided to rent Dino Dan: Dino-Tracker-Ready, Set, Dino! from our local Redbox. Have you heard of Redbox? Too keep it simple, it’s well, a red box. Generally…

 Is Your Image Holding You Back? 
 10 Jul 2012 | 4:26 am Image is everything. When you first meet someone they form a judgment about you within less than 30 seconds (and more like 3). What this means is the way you look matters more than you might think. What matters even more is how YOU feel about your image.I’ve had many conversations with women over the years about how they let their image hold them back and, quite honestly, it makes me very sad. It really doesn’t have to be this way, and the solution can be much more simple than you may realize.Have you experienced any of these?Scenario 1: You’re working from home… 
 Is Your Clothing High-Fat? 
 3 Jul 2012 | 10:01 am Looking your best involves playing up your assets and downplaying your, ahem, flaws. While I don&apos;t like to use the word &apos;flaws&apos; per se, I use it here to make a point. You know what your flaws are, just as much as I know what mine are. Not sure? Your flaws are those things about you that you typically hate (again, another word I don&apos;t like) and are quick to point out to others. That drive you crazy and you wish you could just zap with a laser beam and be done with. But that you&apos;re stuck with for now and evermore. What if I told you that there is really… 
 Are You in the Frumpy Zone? 
 19 Jun 2012 | 3:49 am There is a fine line between looking chic, polished and pulled together and looking frumpy. While no one actively seeks to be frumpy, sometimes women resign themselves to the frump factor simply because they give up – they get tired of trying, they are too busy or they just have no idea what to wear and how it should fit.While it can seem elusive to create a perfectly flattering outfit, it doesn’t have to be as hard as you might think. In fact, sometimes it just takes one or two small changes to take your look from fabulous to frumpy and I want to enlighten you to some of…

 Family Size, and How It Influences Family Size 
 Swistle 12 Jul 2012 | 4:40 am Caitlin and I were emailing more about the decision to have children, and something came up that I want to talk about with a larger sample.I was mentioning how people often cite their own families of origin when explaining their reproduction decisions---but that those decisions can be completely opposite. For example, one sibling from a six-sibling set can say, &quot;Well, I came from a big family so that feels natural to me&quot;---while someone from the same sibling set can say, &quot;Well, I came from a big family and I don&apos;t really want that; we&apos;re planning one or maybe two kids.&quot;And it&apos;s hard to know…

 Swistle 9 Jul 2012 | 2:59 am I placed a few orders for kid clothing to fill in some gaps in our supply. Then I got caught up on the laundry of one of the 2-kid rooms and realized my folly. Whoops.Well, the drawers don&apos;t really NEED to close. And also, how often do I get caught up on laundry? So I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be an issue. There. Rationalized it.********If you are of a plumpish persuasion, may I suggest taking up cooking and/or baking? A career would be ideal, but even as a hobby it works. Just as the sentence &quot;It&apos;s a family name&quot; seems to settle people&apos;s agitation about a peculiar baby name, being a good cook/baker…

 June is passing by 
 All Adither 28 Jun 2012 | 10:05 pm It&apos;s totally &quot;summer&quot; here in Seattle. Which means lots of things, none of which is sun or warmth. Most days we&apos;re still in sweaters and jeans. I might defiantly shove my feet into a pair of flip flops, but then I just end up with cold toes, so it&apos;s not really worth the optimism. We&apos;re wrapping up our first week of the kid&apos;s vacation. And, I have to admit, it&apos;s gone well. I work about three hours a day, and that&apos;s a little hard to fit in, but is doable in bits and pieces. Max and Claire have accompanied me to the grocery store once, a group trip that I usually dread. Before we left I sat them…

And it will hurt. Don&apos;t sign your nine-year-old up for Little League unless you&apos;re cool with spending 3 to 5 cold evenings a week sitting on hard bleachers, eating beef jerky for dinner, and then having to wrangle a cranky family into bed way too late. When it gets to the point that the bi-weekly arrival of your organic vegetable box starts to stress you out, just cancel it. You will feel immense relief. If you see a relatively cheap…

Because his company is headquartered in San Francisco, when he does have to travel out there, he’s gone close to five full days. Monday morning I dropped him off at the airport at 6:30am. He comes home on Friday. Now, I realize lots of working moms have spouses who travel. And lots of moms manage just fine without spouses. But I do not. With my atypical commute of 2.5 hours per day, not having my husband around makes things very complicated. Luckily I have some flexibility at the office. This…

My feelings about this are mixed. As a former camper and counselor, I am so excited for you. Most of my best, non-family related, memories are from my days at overnight camp. You are going to meet wonderful new people from around the country and around the world. You are going to try new things, have new adventures and tackle new challenges. As your mother, I’m struggling…

 Things to do while the kids are away 
 Joanna Bartlett 6 Jul 2012 | 9:19 pm On Sunday, Duncan and Berry go to their Dad’s for three weeks. Twice a year, I get a parental reprieve. I enjoy the first week. And then I miss them so much it becomes distracting. I can make it through the second week. After that…I usually cope with times like these by staying busy. So here’s a list of things to do while they kiddos are away: Learn to play the ukele (after buying one) Update the kids’baby books Sort through photos and order a photo album from whenever the last one left off File the pile of bills upstairs Go on a honeymoon Celebrate Adam’s… 
 Duck in a puddle 
 Joanna Bartlett 26 Jun 2012 | 12:52 pm Yesterday evening, as I drove to class, I saw a bird splashing and bathing in a puddle. Time expanded for a few moments. And I was connected. To the bird (I’m not sure what kind. I’m inclined to say it was a duck, but then I wonder what a duck might have been doing in the middle of the road?). To the puddle and the pavement and the earth. I felt joy in those moments. Joy for that connection. And joy, also, for my awareness of it. And then I drove on, because time keeps moving forward, bring that sent of joy and connectedness with me. 
 Homemade marshmallows and rice krispie treats 
 Joanna Bartlett 21 Mar 2012 | 11:01 am Or: Because apparently I like filling my children with sugar Berry has been begging me for marshmallows. I’m fine with kids having treats. But I do object to them eating ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and food colorings (also artificial sweeteners, hydrogenated oils and MSG–my list of nos is fairly short). It’s surprisingly hard to find marshmallows without those first two ingredients. We did, for a while, at Market of Choice. But then they stopped carrying them. The best I could find are Dandies, which list corn syrup (at least not high fructose) as the…

Allow flavors to mingle at least one hour in the fridge. Garnish with fresh summer fruits—I used apricots and raspberries,…

Except, oh wait, if your kids are in all-day camps, guess what? You still have to pack lunches. ...but not at Camp Galileo! Camp Galileo partners with Choice Lunch to provide, healthy, yummy, and customizable lunches for all of their campers. Cost is $30 per week, or, another way to put it—not having to think about packing lunches? Priceless. They even have an app so you can order lunches on the go.

The blog, which I&apos;ve been quietly posting content on for a few weeks now, already has more than 1,000 pageviews. I think it took this blog a year to achieve that, largely because I only told a few people about it. In fact, I told almost no one about my blog. Much of my traffic that first year came from folks searching the term &quot;fake hickey.&quot;I&apos;ve come a long way since 2005, baby.At any rate, today I had my first big media opportunity for The Maker Mom.

I suspect I&apos;m adopted.&quot;To which my brother Jade commented, &quot;I still hate shopping. She did permanent damage to me.&quot;Though I make a bi-annual pilgrimage into Hobby Lobby, most of the damage of my mother&apos;s marathon shopping trips was done in fabric stores. To this day, I catch one whiff of fabric and a flood of childhood fabric-store trauma washes over me.And no, I&apos;m not being… 
 How a Canuck sabotages 4th of July 
 10 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am After a full 4th of July with a pancake breakfast, biking, seeing Brave and heading down to the fireworks-less festival, we ended our day by going to our friends&apos; soiree. I had a limited amount of time to pull together a dessert so I hastily made our new favorite: this white Texas sheet cake (oh my!) The problem was it wasn&apos;t very patriotic so I figured I&apos;d dye it blue, spread white frosting and then top it off with a strawberry. Perfect color scheme, non?Well, remember how I said I was in a hurry? I quickly mixed the cake batter, put in a couple of drops of blue dye, blended and…

The problem is, they&apos;re shot right above our house and we shut down our street and have a neighborhood party.4th of July 2012: Nada.Though I completely understand the fire ban, what sucked about the situation is we had planned our trip to Canada so we would specifically be here for our 4th of July party, only to have the whole thing be a bust.So, we made the best of it and you know what? We still had the best time. Every year, we attend our church&apos;s…

Now it’s time to take a look at the follow-up film More Business of Being Born (MBOBB). It was another moving, enriching, powerful experience for me. The first film, BOBB, looked at the data detailing the rise in interventions used in hospitals, the alarming increase in cesarean rates while at the same time there has been no increase in infant mortality. MBOBB answers many of the questions women asked the makers about birth options. Director for both films,… 
 Embracing the Chaos of IVF Part 3: Learning to have a little faith 
 Guest Blogger 11 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am When I got home from the PRSA Western District Conference that Monday night, my husband Barry was awake in the den and the door to my mother-in-law’s apartment downstairs was still open. Usually, her door is shut by this time of night, but since Barry was still awake I didn’t think anything of it. I went upstairs and got ready for bed. Within seconds, my smile vanished as I heard Barry yell my name. I ran downstairs to find out what was wrong, but couldn’t find Barry. I heard my name again and quickly realized it was coming from Nancy’s place. As I turned the corner of her stairs, I…

Friday’s premiere event, at 8 p.m., features a post-movie panel with Don Kessler, former head of NASA’s Orbital Debris Program. Regular…

We weathered a storm: And hamster sat (quite literally): We intensified our love of (Andrew) and rediscovered our fascination with (Jack) trains: And started horse camp (heaven help us!): I’ll try to be better about posting, but tomorrow we have a swim meet and a horse show.  Next week football starts.  Then there’s a wedding, followed by boy scout camp and then girl scout camp and then……

 Look out, this is a long one 
 Eden M. Kennedy 10 Jul 2012 | 4:18 pm The last few years it’s been hard to enjoy blogging as much as I used to, and I eventually came to see that my lack of enjoyment was actually a lack of trust. Lack of trust in the ability of the Internet to play nice, but also lack of trust in my own ability to properly assess the impact of what I write as it comes out of me. Back in April, for example, I wrote a post about life coaches in general and Martha Beck more specifically, as I was reading one of her books. The tone of the post was skeptical, to my ear, but I can sort of understand how you might read the post and hear… 
 So Much FunCon 
 Eden M. Kennedy 5 Jun 2012 | 3:47 pm I went to MaxFunCon again this year and I’m not even sure where to begin. Saturday I got to sit at breakfast with Bill Corbett. (If you’re a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 you might be dying a little right now because Bill was the voice of Crow T. Robot.) Bill and his wife, Virginia, came to the reading Alice and I did in Minneapolis last year and he laughed, loudly, in all the right places. Bill is the tops. (Bill’s Rifftrax partner, Kevin Murphy, is not pictured, but he is also the tops. They are co-tops.) About six months ago I cobbled together a small life list…

We’d had to skip over some parts, like the backyard gravedigging and zombies chapter (spoiler alert), because even I didn’t want that to be the last thing on my mind before going to sleep. Our favorite chapters centered on Posey the cat and Barnaby Jones the pug. Jackson was often breathless from laughter, and I take partial responsibility for him failing his language test because I’d kept him up reading past 10:00 o’clock the night before. When we had read everything…

 Jo-Lynne Shane 11 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am This has been a fun week. You’ll see what I mean. Let’s go! On the Fourth of July, we hung out at home all day. I worked while my husband and kids set up our new table and chairs on our brand new deck (they actually finished it that morning.) WOO! I know that probably sounds like a drag of a July 4th, but it was actually LOVELY to work uninterrupted for an entire day. Around 4:00, I signed off the computer and went to make dinner, and we ate for the first time on our deck. It was so fun. We were all pretty much giddy. Afterwards, I promptly fell asleep and missed the fireworks…

 There’s a Dog on My Kayak 
 Haley-O 10 Jul 2012 | 7:06 pm I realize I look obese in this photo. But, although I can’t claim to have my 28-year-old body back by any means, it’s not as bad as it looks up there. And I obviously love you and miss you enough—after this latest long pause between blog posts—to appear obese before you, just to share a laugh. So, our Betty White loves her mom. Can you tell? If I leave her for a minute, she squeals. It’s a bit of a problem, and it really irks the neighbours. So into the kayak she goes…. PEEK-A-BOO! I look like a hunchback in that photo, with bad kayaking form, to make… 
 It’s a good sign that I’m writing 
 Haley-O 13 Jun 2012 | 5:56 pm It’s a good sign that I’m writing today. It means I’m using a little less energy for anxiety, and a little more energy for productive stuff like writing (more than I already do…). Sigh, even though I just received a bill for the ambulance. It’s okay. I’d happily pay anything they asked. Actually I feel pretty close to back-to-normal after the events of last month. Still a little more tired than I’d like to be, still breaking down during yoga (gosh, I wish that would stop). But I’m working on all that by cleaning up my diet (what else is new),… 
 Golden Boy 
 Haley-O 25 May 2012 | 9:44 am Tears streamed down my face as I looked out the window of PICU at SickKids Hospital, May 11, 2012. Walkers from all over the city formed a circle around the hospital—a giant hug for all of the kids, families and staff inside the walls. It was Meaghan’s Walk. I looked back at my 4-year-old son, sedated and intubated on the bed behind me. IVs poking into arms still soft with baby fat, a glowing red toe attached to blinking monitors, mechanical waves of his breath.“Do you feel that big hug, Baby?”The day before, 3:07 p.m., I got a calm call from the school office. I…

 Disrespect Shown for First Lady Michelle Obama by GOP in Florida 
 Queen of Spain 10 Jul 2012 | 11:32 pm There is just no way this would happen to Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton. First Lady Michelle Obama is not welcome at a local high school in Miami by its Republican school board members. The campaign stop went on as planned at Barbara Goleman Senior High in Miami Lakes despite“Miami-Dade School Board member Renier Diaz de la Portilla has called for the event to be cancelled and board member Carlos Curbelo has asked the board attorney to reconsider his opinion that the event meets legal muster.”As it so happens, REPUBLICAN Diaz de la Portilla is running for state House and Curbelo…

 Water Worries 
 Queen of Spain 1 Jul 2012 | 8:34 am My nine-year old son’s swim trunks are the ones on the left. His father’s hang on the right. As I wandered into the bathroom this morning and looked up at them both I nearly fainted when realizing they seemed the same size. How can that be? I was just in the community pool, him in swim diapers, sitting on the stairs holding him tight because he was afraid to go into the big pool. He had a denim hat and adorable little swim trunks and I would slather him until he was he color of paste with sunscreen. Now he jumps in and can grab the ring at the bottom of the deep end…on the…

 My Summer Of Unemployment…And A Really Good Tan 
 Blonde Mom 10 Jul 2012 | 5:33 am This summer started off like most. We went on a road trip Memorial Day weekend. I went back to work that Tuesday. I lost my job that Thursday. After 11 years with the same company, my position was eliminated as part of nationwide restructuring. That’s official corporate speak that officially sucked. I’ve never been unemployed. When I graduated from WKU in 1991 I already had a job lined up at Vanderbilt University. After six and a half years in the News and Public Affairs Office there I briefly worked as an editor of the employee sales magazine for a national insurance company. And… 
 Boredom, You’ve Been Slimed 
 Blonde Mom 5 Jul 2012 | 2:54 pm Our pink and blue neon food coloring made pretty lavender cornstarch slime. Yes, I called slime pretty. It seems like once we pass July 4th that the rest of summer flies by at supersonic speed. Unfortunately my girls then slip into SBT (Standard Boredom Time). My 7-year-old loves to cook and loves experiments so I surprised her during a torturous trip to the grocery store (oh the cruelty!) and told her we were going to pick up ingredients to make homemade slime and flubber.

 Turning Summer Yardwork into Family Fun 
 Diane Kidman 28 Jun 2012 | 1:32 pm Enjoy this guest post on turning your summer yardwork into eco-friendly family fun. And run through the sprinkler while you’re at it, eh? When the weather is warm, summertime chores take family members outdoors to keep the lawn looking nice, the garden weeded and other areas of the house looking spiffy. Finding fun ways accomplish these chores can help your family make long-lasting memories: Lawn Care Keeping the grass cut is often a hot, time-consuming job that pollutes the environment with gasoline fumes. Push reel mowers are an excellent example of a lawnmower for…

 Diane Kidman 8 Jun 2012 | 11:21 am I know, I know. It&apos;s not green. But it&apos;s a free image, and my son is begging me to go swimming so I gotta scat. I’ve accidentally landed into an experiment involving green smoothies. It’s day #4 of an unexpected adventure, and I’ve started writing about it on my author blog at DianeKidman.com. I would love to have you follow along, because as early in the game as it is, it’s already taken a few surprising turns. I’ll be keeping you posted as to my progress, and I’ll even share some smoothie recipes along the way. So grab your bananas and your…

 Gone (Postpartum) Style: Swimsational 
 GIRL&apos;S GONE CHILD 11 Jul 2012 | 12:52 pm Last summer I was blogging about maternity swimsuits which is a whole lot more fun than trying to figure out what to wear after the fact, and even though it&apos;s been ten months since I&apos;ve given birth, my body is still clutching the extra weight like it&apos;s its job. Yes, I&apos;m STILL talking about baby weight. Because my belly still looks a little pregnant and this is something I&apos;m still wrestling with. So? Let&apos;s make postpartumade, shall we?The last time I bought a swimsuit was 1984. Okay, so two years ago, more like. But a bikini is a hilarious joke ha ha and post-twins, I&apos;m 1piece4lyf.

 Gabey Turned 5

Since this is an odd-age year, Gabe didn&apos;t get a friend party. He was a little bummed he wouldn&apos;t have a huge Ninja party with all his friends. (Namely, David T.) Instead, we planned a &quot;family&quot; party down at the pool with pizza, Root Beer floats and a Ninja cake. But it just so happened we had visitors staying with us for the big day: my cousin Kim was in town with her husband and son, and our good friend Robert W. was in town from Japan for a dental convention.

 Because I Am Lucky 
 Goon Squad Sarah 6 Jul 2012 | 10:40 am The crazy storm that blew through the DC area Friday night knocked out our power for five and a half days. It got up to 100 degrees most of those days. It would have been awful if I was stuck at home, but I wasn’t. We grabbed the kids and the cats and drove a few hours to my in-laws’ beach house where it was air-conditioned and instead of suffering after a natural disaster I was suddenly on vacation. Because I am lucky.  Our power was was restored on the 4th of July. There were crews from out of state working in my neighborhood even though it was a Federal holiday. I know this because I… 
 How God Made Me Miss the Iron Maiden Concert 
 Goon Squad Sarah 2 Jul 2012 | 11:28 am I like to walk around the house yelling“God made me miss the Iron Maiden concert!”It probably isn’t fair, or reasonable, or sane to do that, but it is fun. I like to muse that God didn’t want me to see Iron Maiden because of the whole Number Of The Beast thing, but really there are two problems with that. First, I am an Atheist, and second I made an informed decision. What happened is this: we had tickets to the Iron Maiden concert on Friday night in Bristow, Virginia. I have never seen a show at Jiffy Lube Live, but I have heard it is a nightmare venue. People say… 
 Hot in Herrre 
 Goon Squad Sarah 30 Jun 2012 | 11:00 am I have this new fantasy that involves an air-conditioning repair man. I suppose it might be a situational sort of fantasy. It is hard to tell. I might be hallucinating. It is really hot in here. Normally when our AC dies in the middle of the summer (oh yes, this has happened to us before, in Florida) we just buy a new one, but this time is different. You see, we are remodeling 3/4 of my house in about three weeks. Now, when I saw we are remodeling the house, I mean we are paying a contractor to pay other people to remodel our house. We just haven’t picked the contractor yet. The real…

We said,&quot;Sure!&quot; The first night I went over to water, I found the hose in back to be already on with a device attached to the top. It looked like a quick adaptor, but when I tried to put the nozzle in, it just shot water all over me. So then I decided to take the quick adaptor off, because WTF? BAD IDEA. As I watched water come shooting out the sides as I attempted to unscrew the adaptor, I remembered my neighbor saying…

 Our (Not-So-Golden) Golden Years 
 Valerie Young 11 Jul 2012 | 7:39 pm Mothers are so busy managing the here and now that thinking about retirement rarely rises to the top of the “To Do” list. Women’s advocates here in Washington, D.C. are pushing a proposal that would strengthen Social Security for women, especially those who have spent years in the unpaid labor of caregiving, and/or been hit by the lower pay in female-dominated job sectors. Women’s Enews reports: Because women earn lower wages and take time out of the work force for caregiving, they receive smaller Social Security checks than do male workers. In 2009, the average annual Social Security… 
 33 and counting?! 
 Ashley Boyd 11 Jul 2012 | 4:58 pm Earlier today, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 244-185 to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  If this feels like deja vu, it’s because it is.  By the its own count, the GOP majority has voted to repeal or defund the Affordable Care 33 times—yes, 33 times!—since it claimed the majority in 2010.   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called this action a waste of time and the“bill to nowhere”since a repeal effort has no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate or surviving a Presidential veto. It’s time to move on.  According to a recent…

Everyone gets sick at some point in their lives from a cold, to a cough, or even worse.  But did you know that not everyone has a chance to get better? A whopping 40 million people in the United States don’t have access to a single paid sick day.  In fact, nearly 80% of low wage workers and 40% of private sector workers don’t have access to a single paid sick day.  And this means that many people have little choice but to go to work sick–rather than staying home to…

Even if you think you know what Callaloo or Shark&amp;Bake tastes like, you haven&apos;t tried it until you&apos;ve tasted it here.  Green Figs… 
 Exit the Highway to White Sands National Monument 
 Glennia 6 Jul 2012 | 9:32 pm One of my favorite places in our travels across the US has been the White Sands National Monument, near Alamogordo, New Mexico.  This summer, our friends at Toyota have partnered with the Audobon Society to encourage everyone to exit the highway and visit beautiful, off-the-beaten-path places like White Sands. The White Sands National Monument rises up out of the scrubby brown New Mexico desert like a far off  dream.  You might think you&apos;re seeing the purest, whitest snow imaginable, but get closer, and you realize that it&apos;s a hot, dry white powder covering the landscape for as far as the…

If there is a mosquito in the house, I will find it. I will have to either thank or apologize to my husband, at least once, every day. Not before the cat uses my stomach as a springboard and pounces on my husband&apos;s head sometime around 4 a.m. Someone will have forgotten to switch the laundry (most probably, me).

 Liz@ThisFullHouse 29 Jun 2012 | 1:15 pm If you were to ask me what pandemonium meant, B.C. (before children) I would have suggested that it sort of sounds like a digestive aid for pandas.  Panda.  Ammonium.  Get it? [sound of crickets, chirping] Beeeeeeeecawse, you see, although I had a weird sense of humor (okay, have) I still would NOT have fully understood what pandemonium meant (literally) and probably even spelled it incorrectly as pandamonium, anyway.  Then I had kids, someone invented spell check (PHEW!) and, well, I can safely say that...YES!...we NOW live in a constant state of: any scene of wild confusion or disorder.

 Why Do We Write Here? 
 velveteenmind@gmail.com (Megan Jordan) 28 Jun 2012 | 8:20 am The first issue of my new subscription to The Oxford American arrived recently. I&apos;ve checked our mailbox daily for it, always disappointed that it hadn&apos;t arrived, yet, and slowly deciding that it must be a sad organization because delivery was taking so long. The Oxford American is a literary magazine published in Mississippi. I should be ashamed to have only recently subscribed to it, as both a magazine editor and a Mississippi writer.  Why hadn&apos;t I subscribed to it or even read it, yet? I admit intimidation. I didn&apos;t want to know just how much room for improvement my work allowed. Ahem. I… 
 I Heard God Laugh. And It Sounded Like Screaming. 
 velveteenmind@gmail.com (Megan Jordan) 8 May 2012 | 5:31 am I committed to a slash-and-burn attack on my life and then I heard God laugh, nearly audibly. And it sounded like screaming. On March 19, my two year old daughter, Iris, had a series of febrile seizures. I recognized what was happening because I once heard a story about febrile seizures. The minutes that recognition bought us may have helped save her from permanent damage. So I&apos;m going to tell you a story about febrile seizures. I&apos;m going to tell you the whole thing and it&apos;s going to be long and then I&apos;m going to be done with it. And I want you to remember it. The Trigger March 19 was a…

More than two months after I wrote my last post. Yes. It&apos;s time to write. My story ideas grow and grow and then grow moldy. Thick vines encroach on these seedlings of thoughts and I lose them in the tangle, only to find them later, compressed and scarred.  Fire has surrounded me for months now. I&apos;ve frequently written about it and, in a very &quot;The Secret&quot; way, felt it creep into conversations, attracting it. Despite the fact that I am not into astrology, I caught myself telling a friend that…

 Independence Day 
 5 Jul 2012 | 9:18 am In this family, celebrating our nation&apos;s birthday apparently involves wrestling. And snow cones. And cotton candy. And chips. Which explains the wrestling, I think. Some explosions are necessary, of course. A parade of flags, of course. And milk-drunk babies. 
 Keeping it real 
 18 Jun 2012 | 9:13 pm We&apos;re two weeks into summer vacation for the big kids, and I&apos;m not sure what end is up these days. Looking back at start-of-summer posts from years past, I was always either announcing a plan, or announcing that we were going plan free, or vowing to make it the best summer ever or vowing to survive it, but not promising to survive it gracefully. I can&apos;t even get it together to put a stake in the ground (so, maybe this is a plan-free year. WHO CAN SAY?) Of course, this last month has been a doozy.

 12 Jun 2012 | 9:55 am I&apos;m good at compartmentalizing, or so I claim. I&apos;m good in a crisis, able to emotionally detach and do what must be done. Still, when my husband&apos;s second call in a 10 minute period popped up on my cell phone, in the middle of one of my conference calls, I knew something must be up. His voice broke as he told me that he just got off the phone with his dad, and his mom had died in the night. He was driving home, he said. He wanted to get to his dad&apos;s side as soon as possible, but he just needed to come home first. He hung up with a sob in his voice. I immediately informed my team and my boss…

 Ways in which I am an Anglophile 
 Marilyn 6 Jul 2012 | 10:04 am I promise not to gush about Doctor Who but I do want to talk about other Brit related stuffs that I am quite enjoying these days.  Because I am charmed with the British Isles these days.  And frankly, Doctor Who is really but just a symptom of that. God Bless Cost Plus World Market!  They sell a decent (if small) selection of British yummies that we have discovered and embraced. Digestives.  I know, not the best name.  They’re basically cookies, but of course they don’t call them cookies.  No, they’re biscuits.  Very much like a graham cracker, actually.  Full of… 
 I’d be here, but I don’t want to frighten you 
 Marilyn 22 Jun 2012 | 10:15 am So why haven’t I been around these parts, even though I have admitted that I’m feeling fantastic these days?  Plainly put, I don’t want to scare you (all five of you) off.  Because I am happy and I’m contentedly obsessed with various things but it’s not the sort of thing I want to talk about around HERE.  Or on Facebook.  I’ve been neglecting Facebook too.  I might stop in a couple times a week for a quick browse through recent status updates.  That’s just…a lot less Facebooking than I was doing before.  But I can’t let the freak… 
 Back to life 
 Marilyn 15 May 2012 | 11:39 am I’ve mentioned before that I’m feeling better now than I did even just a year ago.  And so much better than the years before that even.  But now…oh my.  The difference is so startling.  And that’s just the difference between when I felt that I was better and now when I am SO MUCH better.  And I look back, at the last 5 or so years, and I wonder“HOW did I make it, feeling that way??”It’s plain to me now that I wasn’t really living.  I was existing.  Surviving.  Going through the motions and letting one day roll into the next until…

 #BlogHerPromises 
 Karen Sugarpants 11 Jul 2012 | 5:39 pm  I’ve been to BlogHer a number of times and I’m going this year. There are certain things I, dear readers, promise to you during this BlogHer: #1: I promise I will not crab about any travel snags. One of the most annoying tweet-a-thons I experience is when someone is having travel issues, and they tweet the whole thing, in hopes of getting some sort of compensation, just because they have 80 million followers. #2: I promise I will not take any swag that I won’t actually use. I’m shamelessly stealing this pet peeve from @temptingsam. She’s… 
 Getting With the Program 
 Karen Sugarpants 11 Jul 2012 | 10:20 am So remember when bloggers all made pages for their blog because it was a way to grow their readership and stuff? I’m slow. Like, painfully slow. As in, I just did it today because I have some big news to share and part of the deal is that I need a Facebook page and I didn’t have one because I was fearful of my world’s colliding and my Great Aunt Matilda reading this blog and yeah I don’t really have a Great Aunt Matilda, but if I did she’d be one of those Aunts that calls and asks if every post is about her. Yanno? Anyway, go hit“like”on my Facebook… 
 Anger 
 Karen Sugarpants 9 Jul 2012 | 9:58 pm I don’t get angry often. I am by nature, hard wired to yell, but I don’t. I don’t know if it’s that same apathy Adam speaks of, or if I’m paralysed by fear of becoming my biological mother. Daren insists I am nothing like that illogical, screaming banshee of a drunk whore, but hey: if you were the only female born to such a creature, you’d be terrified too. Better to squash any signs of her, in my eyes. I fear the eventually of the volcano. I often wonder if I’m squashing other parts of me, as I pour Pepto on the hot&amp;angry parts. I hope not.

 Sick Day 
 Annika 12 Jul 2012 | 6:45 am The children are sick. Not take-them-to-the-doctor sick, just a summer cold. (Isn’t it funny that we–or at least I–feel the need to specify that it’s a summer cold, as though summer colds were in any way distinguished from regular colds? BUT IT’S JULY! And it’s hot out, see? So a cold is funny!) I should have known something was up when Grace was super-cranky for like three days straight, but it wasn’t until Tuesday afternoon that I figured it out. She’d finally gotten down off my lap, after a couple hours of climbing on me and yelling. I…

 5 Signs You Need to Let Go 
 heather@glamaLIFE.com (Heather Schuck) 9 Jul 2012 | 12:23 pm All too often we trap ourselves in relationships, partnerships and commitments that no longer serve us. The friend that’s quick to take, but never gives. The business partner who nods in agreement, but undermines behind closed doors. The dreaded weekly commitment you still honor even though its diverted from your beliefs months ago. We daydream of letting go, but never do. Not because we can’t, but because we won’t. Unfortunately, emotional shackles are much harder to shake than the shiny metal ones. So how do know when the time is right to let go? The Relationship is Toxic…

 Why Your Chicken Could Be Giving You Nasty Bladder Infections 
 Deborah Dunham 12 Jul 2012 | 7:48 am If you’re one of the 8 million women suffering from a nasty, incurable bladder infection, here’s a clue as to why: You’ve been eating too much chicken. Medical researchers are blaming our perpetual bladder infections on disgusting E. coli superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics and growing in chickens. That bacteria is then–you guessed it–transferred to our bodies and our bladders when we eat it, according to what Amee Manges, epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal told ABC. We’re finding the same or related E. coli in human infections and in…

 Zoobiquity: How We Can Improve Health Care By Paying Closer Attention To Our Pets

They could probably share common ground on the obesity epidemic, which both people and our pets are struggling from. They may be able to talk about how both you and your canine companion are predisposed to breast cancer, depending on her breed. In fact, vets and doctors actually have a lot in common–and, to treat both humans and other animals the best way possible, they should probably be…

I’m working again, a small job at a big company, one that employs my skills but doesn’t engaged my brain. I’ll be working on my business, too, now that my daughter’s illness is settling into a manageable pattern. I can keep food on my table and still spend the afternoons at the shore. Barring any more ER visits (and there was another last week, a useless trip dictated by my doctor’s vacation schedule) or upticks in what’s… 
 Invalid’s Breakfast Menu 
 Mrs. Chicken 3 Jul 2012 | 11:57 am A few weeks ago—actually, a month ago almost exactly—I wound up in the ER after a sudden, excruciating pain in my right groin. I spent about five hours waiting for an ultrasound, whereupon it was discovered that I have an unimaginable number of fibroid tumors and therefore, a distorted uterus. Also, maybe, they’re not sure, must be a burst ovarian cyst. Go, me! They sent me packing with some delightful pain meds and some Zofran, which is also delightful. In fact, I took one this morning and I can totally see how people get addicted to this stuff. Wheeee, all is right…

 Makeup Confession: My Favorite Beauty Product of All Time: Must-Have Eyeshadow Palettes 
 The Domestic Diva 10 Jul 2012 | 10:41 am One of the first makeup products I ever used was an eyeshadow palette. I believe it was from Estee Lauder. My Mom had received it as a“free gift”and gave it to me to use when I first started wearing makeup in my teens. From that day forward I was hooked on palettes, specifically eyeshadow palettes. What I love about large eyeshadow palettes are the endless creative possibilities. With just about every color of the rainbow represented one can mix and blend to achieve just about any look. Eyeshadow palettes are one of my top beauty choices of all time because its a beauty tool… 
 Patriotic Nails: the Red, the White, and the Matte? 
 The Domestic Diva 4 Jul 2012 | 9:47 pm Before heading out the door to Independence Day celebrations I looked down at my nails and noticed they needed a fresh coat of paint. Since it is the Fourth of July I thought I would paint them in a patriotic theme. I quickly rummaged through my nail care box looking for any polish that resembled red, white, and blue…. I knew I wanted to paint my nails all the same except for my ring finger which I usually paint a different color. Since we are going with a red, white, and blue theme I decided to use the Sally Hansen Gem Crush 02 Cha-Ching as my“red&amp;white”sealed with…

Spider-man is one of my kidlet’s all time favorite superheroes. As a result we have a lot of spider-man stuff in our house. The other day I took the kidlets up to my local Walmart and shared with them the new Web-Slinger AR App. Like the Avengers AR app, the Web-slinger AR app uses signs inside of Walmart stores…

We tell ourselves to focus on our own progress, our own work, our own success. But still, it’s hard not to feel jealous sometimes of someone else’s great book deal, or awesome review, or amazing marketing plan, or superstar agent if you’re still in the agent-querying phase of your career. I’ve been there. Of course I have. But the thing I find myself most jealous of these days isn’t…

Every week (when things weren’t too crazy with work), I would post a quick and easy recipe for moms who enjoy cooking for the family but are exhausted after a full day of work. I haven’t done Tasty Tuesday in awhile because, to be honest, my quick and easy meals have lately consisted of hot dogs, soup, tacos, cut-up fruit, and veggie sticks. Earlier this year I had great intentions of cooking and freezing a week’s worth of food every Sunday, but my Sundays are as busy as any other day,…

Which one is your favorite?  Do you hide your Disney Band-Aids from your children in order for them not use all of the Disney Band-Aids (LOL)? Photo Credit: EH Photo Credit: EH …

 I&apos;m Having Trouble Working From Home 
 11 Jul 2012 | 6:38 pm Hi again! I&apos;ve been having trouble getting stuff done, what with these kids all up in my business all day every day. It&apos;s a problem. Not surprisingly, this is what I wrote about for White Knuckle Parenting—Working While Parenting. I&apos;m still working on my offline project, which is of no interest to you, but it is keeping me from writing during my infrequent time when I&apos;m not taking care of my kids. I plan to be done with it this weekend, so I&apos;ll be back happily typing away before too long! 
 I&apos;m Sorry. This Is Kind of a Filler Post. 
 8 Jul 2012 | 6:16 pm I&apos;m still working on my big offline project, which is why I haven&apos;t been doing much writing. It was looking a little sad here though, so I thought I should maybe post a photo of a cute animal. As I do. So, without further ado, a photo of the cute beneficiary of my extra mouse food. I like how he&apos;s sprawled out in the middle of it. See you soon!

 How do you stay connected? 
 Alexia 9 Jul 2012 | 9:27 am  So, for mothers, and others who work at home keeping in touch with outside sources is a must. Your connections to companies, brands, and just people you work on anything with is vital. Skype makes this possible. I use Skype conference calling to stay in touch with contacts, when we need to dicuss the logistics of a campaign. Being able to share ideas and speak in a manner that transcends a regular phone call is key. Skype makes this possible. One of the most important things for me about these calls is that they are free as long as the other party is using Skype as well. I save on… 
 Keep it in the family 
 Alexia 26 Jun 2012 | 8:49 am It’s time to say more and stay human.  It’s time for Skype. Staying in touch with those who are close to you when they are not close by can be a challenge. Email and phone calls as well a photo accounts of your life are one way to do this, but the best way to stay in touch is Skype. You can chat live, while watching the people you normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to see, right in front of you. They get to see you live as well. This way you can share a more intimate chat, and when little ones are involved it can be a lot of fun. When we talk to my parents we have our… 
 YooHoo! 
 Alexia 3 Jun 2012 | 8:06 pm Adorable. These plush toys are a lot of fun, and they are pretty unusual looking; this little guy stands out among my daughters collection of stuffed animals, and she takes him everywhere as he is little and easy to tote around. When you give him a squeeze, he makes a little roaring sound! There’s a whole interactive website based on these little guys http://yoohoo.auroraworld.com/

 Michael Phelps&apos;s mom, Debbie Phelps: Minimalist Parent 
 Asha Dornfest 11 Jul 2012 | 8:25 am My heart leapt with joy when I read an interview with Debbie Phelps, mother of America&apos;s Favorite Swimmer, Michael Phelps. In it, she talked about the importance of backing off as a parent, even when your kid shows Olympic talent. “Children have to do what they enjoy,” Debbie told TODAY.com. “You have to let your kids find what’s best for them and what their own niche is.” When the mother of a 14-Olympic-medal-winner says&quot;don&apos;t push your kid in sports,&quot;I&apos;m thinking that&apos;s pretty good advice.

 Hitting the surface: What&apos;s next for Minimalist Parenting and me 
 Asha Dornfest 10 Jul 2012 | 11:59 am WELL HELLO MY FRIENDS! This is me hitting the surface after a couple weeks on a deep dive in the book-writing ocean. *Big, celebratory inhale* As most of you know, Christine Koh and I are writing a book together: Minimalist Parenting: Enjoy Modern Family Life More by Doing Less. In my case, as we approached the submit-the-manuscript-to-the-editor date, it meant doing more book-writing and less of everything else -- which is why you haven&apos;t seen me during the last couple weeks here or in social media. But I am so very excited to tell you that the first draft of Minimalist Parenting… 
 How to more comfortably carry a diaper bag AND baby carrier at the same time 
 Asha Dornfest 25 Jun 2012 | 5:57 am Not only did Karen come up with a great hack, she sent in this AWESOME photo illustration to go along with it! (Thank you, Karen -- it really helps.) This is the third kid I&apos;ve worn in my Trekker baby carrier and I just figured out how to make it more comfortable when carry my diaper bag at the same time: Put the diaper bag on my shoulder before clipping the second strap or put a carrier strap through the diaper bag handle. No child was awakened during the taking of these pictures. My shoulders started aching with the memory of lugging my kid in the Baby Bjorn AND the diaper…

 Why Your Chicken Could Be Giving You Nasty Bladder Infections 
 Deborah Dunham 12 Jul 2012 | 7:48 am If you’re one of the 8 million women suffering from a nasty, incurable bladder infection, here’s a clue as to why: You’ve been eating too much chicken. Medical researchers are blaming our perpetual bladder infections on disgusting E. coli superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics and growing in chickens. That bacteria is then–you guessed it–transferred to our bodies and our bladders when we eat it, according to what Amee Manges, epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal told ABC. We’re finding the same or related E. coli in human infections and in…

 Zoobiquity: How We Can Improve Health Care By Paying Closer Attention To Our Pets 
 Hanna Brooks Olsen 12 Jul 2012 | 7:06 am Zoobiquity authors, Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers; Images by Joanna Brooks If your dog’s vet and your OB/GYN got together, do you think they’d have much to talk about? They could probably share common ground on the obesity epidemic, which both people and our pets are struggling from. They may be able to talk about how both you and your canine companion are predisposed to breast cancer, depending on her breed. In fact, vets and doctors actually have a lot in common–and, to treat both humans and other animals the best way possible, they should probably be…

 Pumping Your Child For Camp Deets 
 2 Jul 2012 | 7:27 pm Anyone with a school-age child is probably familiar with this conversation: Hi sweetie! What&apos;d you do at camp/school today? Nothing. Nothing? What were the best and worst and most interesting parts of your day? Nothing, mama. It&apos;s the same as every other day. Sound familiar? Ever wonder how to get the info out of them in ways that don&apos;t involve bribing their friends for details? Fear not! Though pulling teeth can be easier than getting information on what happens at camp from these kids, we have discovered an easy way to have them share. It&apos;s simple, really. Just try and put them to… 
 Is Your Brand Red or Blue? Apparently, it Matters. 
 15 Jun 2012 | 9:26 am If you like Starbucks, does that make you a Republican or a Democrat? What about Dunkin Donuts? Are Animal Planet lovers Blue or Red? And name the brand with bi-partisan support: Visa, Subway, or MLB? The answers might surprise you. An article in yesterday&apos;s LA Times highlights where Democrats and Republicans differ in their brand preferences. We&apos;d like to suggest that the next time there&apos;s a stalemate in Congress, peeps pass out the Coca-Cola instead of coffee. It&apos;s the little things that bring us together, you know. 
 Please, Don&apos;t Let Me Blink 
 14 Jun 2012 | 3:55 pm Today was mini&apos;s last day of first grade. She&apos;s definitely not a baby anymore. So what did this mother do? Yup, same thing mothers have done for generations before us. Have lunch with a friend and the children and spend the hour lamenting about that fact that you spend all this time taking care of a baby who grows up the second you blink. Silly woman. She blinked. It all goes by so fast. You&apos;ve heard this cliche before. You don&apos;t understand it until you actually have kids, but it&apos;s really true.  However, what they fail to prepare you for, is just how much…

 What’s In a Lesbian Super PAC? 
 Dana 12 Jul 2012 | 5:09 am A lesbian Super PAC? Sounds like a flannel-wrapped emergency kit consisting of hummus, dental dams, and a cheat sheet of Indigo Girls’lyrics. In reality, the lesbian Super PAC launched yesterday, LPAC, is“the first of its kind lesbian political action committee”that“sets out to positively influence policies that impact women by electing candidates who champion issues that impact lesbians and their families.”LPAC has big-name support, including actor Jane Lynch and tennis legend Billie Jean King. It will be chaired by businesswoman Sarah Schmidt, along with… 
 Birthday Pride 
 Dana 11 Jul 2012 | 5:03 am (Originally published a few weeks ago in my Mombian newspaper column.) My son is turning nine soon, and it frightens me. Nine is perilously close to ten, first of the double digits, rubbing shoulders with that phantasm of every parent’s nightmares, puberty. Nine seems like the last hurrah of young childhood before it gradually starts to give way to the moods, interests, and concerns of an older phase of life. Puberty is the big transformation, of course, but nine reminds me that we’re well on our way towards it. The fact that my son has had a recent growth spurt, now wears my shoe size,… 
 Jennifer Lopez Developing TV Series About Lesbian Moms 
 Dana 10 Jul 2012 | 5:15 am Jennifer Lopez is developing a TV series for ABC Family about two lesbian moms, Deadline reports. Will the hour-long drama give us an authentic (albeit fictionalized) portrayal of a lesbian-headed family? Will it stay away from tired clichés, like“the wacky search for sperm”? Will J.Lo sing and dance about baby strollers? The answer to the first two is“it very well could.”Deadline tells us the show involves“a lesbian couple who suddenly have their already child heavy household turned upside down when a wayward teenage girl moves in. One of the mothers is a…

 GlassesUSA.com Review! 
 Jessica 1 Jul 2012 | 10:46 am If you know me, you know that I love eyeglasses and sunglasses! I’m not picky about my glasses.  They can be a no brand or name brand pair and I’ll love them equally.  In fact, a few weeks ago my favorite pair of  sunglasses broke after my daughter sat on them.  They were just a cheapo pair, but I was crushed.  I had owned this particular pair for nearly two years and they were perfect. Shortly after they broke, I was approached by GlassesUSA.com to review a pair of glasses from their website.  Not only do they offer prescription glasses for everyday use, but they offer a…

 Summer So Far 
 Ree 12 Jul 2012 | 6:44 am Here are the some various phone photos that have documented our summer so far. When I was in Seattle in June, I went to the Chihouly exhibit at the Space Needle with my sister Betsy, my childhood friend Mitch, and my homegirls Elise and Jaden. And Guy, Elise’s friend. He’s from France.   Outside the exhibit, I plopped down in the supine position in an attempt to get a neato perspective of the Space Needle.   Then Guy walked outside and immediately ran over and told everyone to call the paramedics. I snapped a photo of him before…

Turned out,… 
 Fireworks and Family Values 
 Ree 5 Jul 2012 | 8:24 am The Fourth of July began with Marlboro Man spraying our entire homestead for bugs. An outdoor food party on a cattle ranch would otherwise be a fly-infested and intolerable place. I love a man who can both operate a spray truck and drive at the same time. When I was sixteen years old, I’m not sure I ever imagined myself saying that.  Our good friends from Oklahoma City came up in the morning and started helping with whatever party-related tasks we needed help with. This primarily involved unwrapping explosive devices.   Like these.   I…

 Sesame Street and Cookie Monster Spoof “Call Me Maybe” 
 April Rueb 10 Jul 2012 | 10:46 am The popularity of Carly Rae Jepsen’s song“Call Me Maybe”is undeniable. Jepsen’s original video for the song has been seen almost 150 million times on YouTube and it has spawned countless spoofs. But just when we thought we had seen all of the“Call Me Maybe”parodies of note, Cookie Monster surprised us with his own take on the summer anthem:“Share Me Maybe.”We love Cookie’s singing and dancing skills, but we’re most impressed that he remembers the importance of sharing—a difficult skill for monsters and toddlers.

 Night Light 
 Design Mom 11 Jul 2012 | 1:36 pm I’m really digging these night lights by The Rekindled Page. The creator offers over 50 designs and makes each one by hand from repurposed and upcycled materials. They have an industrial vintage feel to them and I think they would make a really neat gift! Do you use night lights at your house? Or does your family prefer perfectly dark rooms while they slumber? We like to keep a night light on in the bathroom.

Some years we do something awesome (like climbing a Fourteener for our 14th anniversary — the photo above is us on the top of the mountain). But other years are more laid back. I remember one gift exchange when we were still newlyweds that totally bombed. We both tried really hard to come up with something amazing, while keeping within our tiny,…

 Girls Gone Coastal 
 angella 11 Jul 2012 | 9:09 pm Last summer, Sir Graham went to sleep away camp for the very first time (I did not cope well)(He was EIGHT)(I didn’t go to camp until I was THIRTEEN). He could have gone the year before, but we didn’t know that he could and I am okay with that. But! That means that Master Nathan is of age this year and the two of them signed up and are even in the same cabin. Yay! And also, I CAN’T EVEN. When the decision was made for the dudes to go to camp, I told Emily that we would go on a girls’trip. Just me, and her, and a trip to the coast to see family and friends. Hover above…

 angella 6 Jul 2012 | 6:47 am Matthew’s sister and her three kids rolled into town this past Monday (Her husband stayed home to work. Boo. We’ve been friends since college and I introduced them to each other). Matthew’s brother and his wife live here in town with their two boys.  Between the three families, there are eight kids (six boys, two girls) who were all born in a four-year time span. This week has been ALL COUSINS, ALL THE TIME. They get along so great that it is a little bit unreal, and a lot of awesome. The boys hiked up the hill behind our house and found a small plateau surrounded by trees…

 angella 2 Jul 2012 | 9:10 pm You might remember that on June 2nd, I ran in the Action Festival 10K around Giant’s Head Mountain. I ran that same race last year, with a time of 1:05, and beat that time this year by finishing in 1:03. Last year after the race, I told myself that I would keep running longer runs (6-8K) because I could and it would push me harder than my usual 5K runs that I do. But being someone who does not push herself as hard as when I have something/someone to push me (See workout DVD’s vs. my boot camp instructor), I got lazy and fell back into the 5K runs.

 Why Adopt [Internationally]?

Apparently, not hard at all. These hedge trimmers can cut through ANYTHING!!!

Our prayers were answered.  We have been shown something that we can no longer ignore.–And,…

 Urban-Language Barrier 
 MommyTime 24 Jun 2012 | 2:35 pm When you let suburban American children loose in a city--especially in a European city--you are bound to discover a vast realm of knowledge they do not have. Sure, you expect a language barrier in Paris. (And, to a lesser extent, in London, where even common sentences like &quot;mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot; will elicit endless repetitions of the phrase &quot;mind the gap&quot; in an approximated accent.) But there is also an urban-language barrier, both more unexpected and more awkward to manage. Here is a partial list of things suburban children do not know--and that you will not be… 
 Thoughts from the Train

It is a far cry from the clickity-clack of Old West movies or the soot-filled Victorian journeys that marked the dawn of “progress” across England. And while I am drinking Starbucks and using wifi on the climate-controlled train, we are nonetheless passing whole villages of tile-roofed houses and fields thick with damp and redolent of prior ages. Deeply green, the grasses have a… 
 Educating Gracefully: A Minor Rant on Obligation

And the vast majority of the time, they are teachers I deeply admire, thinkers and writers I respect, citizens of the world I would like to emulate. But come the end of the semester, I start seeing all over my Facebook page, and on the blogs and pages of friends of friends, and in the comments sections of academic blogs written by people I don&apos;t even know, something that drives me crazy: &quot;funny&quot; quotations from student papers. Someone will write something like this: I learn something new every day. Today it was that &quot;Shakespeare and his Mid…

 Crunchy Carpets 7 Jul 2012 | 2:41 pm Being an urban dweller that is not in the construction industry, driving a pickup truck was not on my radar.   However, I like the idea of ‘big’ and have caught myself gazing at the Ford F150’s in my ‘hood.  I therefore could hardly say no to test one out for a few days.  I picked up the truck and drove home in the gorgeous 2012 Ford F-150 FX in bright red with a big grin on my face, riding high over the crowded roads of Vancouver feeling the thrill of being the biggest kid on the road. The first thing I noticed was despite the size and height, this is a very nimble vehicle.  It…

 Crunchy Carpets 4 Jul 2012 | 10:04 pm Ooooh man…keep IT together.  Getting into a summer routine has been a bit rough to put it mildly.  I look forward to finding my feet and a routine that works for all of us. I kind of gaped when our‘other’son told me summer was boring already.  It just started.  Hopefully, with them out again tonight playing in self made forts they will all get into some pattern that doesn’t involve them bickering with each other and me all day long.  Keeping the preschooler out of their way and mine is another story. I would make plans for wading and swimming pools and what not… 
 What Makes a Community? 
 Crunchy Carpets 30 Jun 2012 | 5:06 pm A lady recently made a comment to my mom that her place was such a‘home.’This was apparently a surprise to her since my mom rents.   As lifelong renters, mom and I found this an odd and sad observation.   For many it seems, renting means transitory and therefore not  home.   Buying for some equals  home. If you rent, is your place your home?  Have you made it a home?   I feel that my place is my home until the landlords like to remind me that it isn’t, like when there is work being done on the place and the contractors run roughshod over your property because YOU…

 Freak Flags Are The Best Kind Of Flags

Emily was all sleepy-eyed, asking questions about LOST.“So, the black smoke came to be because the dude got pushed into the golden cave, right?”Josh was all wide-eyed, showing me pictures from the issue of National Geographic that he had in his hands.“Monkeys, Mama! MONKEYS!”Isabella was all doe-eyed, convincing me that she actually does need to wear a sweater to camp.“I know it’s 150 degrees outside, but sometimes, Mama, you just need a sweater. You just… 
 Life Was Just Different Back Then, You Guys 
 ali 9 Jul 2012 | 6:36 am Because we have these new summer rules at our house, movie night has taken on extra-special meaning. Instead of one watching LOST on the tv in our bedroom, one watching a superhero movie on the tv in our family room and one watching something animated on the tv in the basement, movie night is family movie night, where we all crowd on top of each other on one single couch, passing the popcorn and arguing over the blanket. So now I am constantly on the search to find things that interest all three of the kids, which—when you have kids who are as different as mine are—can be a challenge.

 Whatever happened to… the BlogHer 2007 edition 
 selfmademom 4 Jul 2012 | 11:39 am It’s about that time of year where everyone is getting themselves and their business cards ready for the yearly blogger conference behemoth BlogHer. I haven’t been to BlogHer since 2009 and I’m actually not going back this year either. Too much work, not enough time, not enough money. I enjoyed my two BlogHer experiences in 2007 and 2009 and when I was cleaning out my closet recently I came upon some of those afore-mentioned business cards of BlogHers gone by. It brought a smile to my face. I only found a few, but some that evoked memories of a time past where the blog… 
 Hey! I still write for Chicago Parent!

Find out where to“cool off”in my latest“Best in Chi”Column for my favorite local parenting magazine!

 Things I’ve been meaning to mention… 
 selfmademom 15 Jun 2012 | 4:31 am When you haven’t posted in almost a month–hello Memorial Day, end of school, yadda yadda, people start sending you cool things to talk about. Isn’t that how it works? (Joking). Usually with blogging, it’s the other way around: the more you write, the more you get. But for some reason, my friends around the industry have been really, really busy. And they are talking about some cool things that I want to mention to y’all here. The first is from my amazing, multi-talented friend, Beth. Y’all know I’ve known Beth for like FOREVER in the blog world and…

 Beginning Strength Training (Intro) 
 jennydecki 7 Jul 2012 | 1:39 pm I’ve been thinking more about strength training lately. I want to be stronger. The myth of bulking up is just not something I’m worried about, because to get to the point I’d have to pass the “toned” phase and I’d love some muscles that aren’t all sedentary and whatnot. Plus, everything on Google tells me it’s impossible, so there. Mostly, I’m planning on re-starting my life after my kids are out of the house, so why not start now? If I finish early and start maintaining before they’re out of the house it’s not like I’ve lost something and putting that kind of time… 
 The Primal Blueprint (Day 6) 
 jennydecki 25 May 2012 | 10:37 am I’ve spent the last few days running in the yard with my kids, barefoot and happy. Last night I got a stomachache after eating a hamburger but don’t know if it was the beef or the organic all-natural ketchup and mustard I had on the hamburger. It might be too much beef in one day. We’re looking into getting half a cow. I’m excited about it. I’ll know my meat is safe and won’t have to worry about buying anything other than veggies, fruit, and almonds (as staples) for the rest of the year! We’ll probably also have to get half a pig for variety (and… 
 The Primal Blueprint (Day 3) 
 jennydecki 22 May 2012 | 5:23 am First, I have to clarify that even though I’m following what I think is advice from The Primal Blueprint, I’m still waiting my turn for the library book to come in before I know for sure. While this will, eventually, become a book I buy so it can sit as a reference/reminder or whatever, for now it is still“that book I’d like to check out.”No offense to the book or the author, of course, but I’m just not someone who dumps money immediately into a lifestyle choice. If it’s really a lifestyle choice, it will last long enough for me to see the library…

 Warmth and Comfort 
 CharTherCT 10 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm Having a fireplace in tropical countries is not applicable. We don’t have the winter season basically. But in certain countries where there is that cold, winter season, they need to have a fireplace in their homes to give them warmth and comfort during those winter season. If your family’s home enjoy the use of a fireplace but don’t like the associated energy costs, getting a standard or deluxe electric fireplace insert which are basically designed to increase a fireplace’s efficiency is a practical idea. A family knows there is nothing like a blazing fireplace to create… 
 Power Interruptions 
 CharTherCT 10 Jul 2012 | 9:26 pm We got a text from our sister telling us about a power interruption schedule for thirty minutes only late in the evening on Friday in certain areas in the city. I found hubby looking into belt pulleys, chain drive and idler sprockets, and bushings on the internet when I went into the living room to share the news and information to him. I believe there are two days of switching power interruptions. One of Friday July 13 and another one on July 16 affecting the DLPC customers in the downtown and northern areas of its franchise. These service interruptions are necessary to facilitate the… 
 Guitar 
 CharTherCT 10 Jul 2012 | 9:00 pm It was interesting to know that one of the kids at the big school of our little boy has a good talent in playing the electric guitar. The little boy was amazed actually when he saw the big kid play a little sample at the music store where we met a few days ago at the mall. The electric guitar he tried at the store does make me think of that gibson sg standard limited electric guitar I have seen before online good for an aspiring classic rocker. The little boy has expressed his interest in music and he told me“I like that guitar”when he saw the limited electric guitar I was…

 Antibacterials in Personal-Care Products Linked to Allergy Risk in Children 
 Colleen Hurley, RD, Certified Kid’s Nutrition Specialist 9 Jul 2012 | 5:24 pm Babies and toddlers love to touch anything and everything, not to mention all the things that they put into their mouths too.  It’s easy to get caught up in trying to keep your kids away from germs, although this is often a mission impossible.  However, research has been finding that being too germ-o-phobic may actually [...] 
 How Much Water Do Babies Need to Drink?

 Colleen Hurley, RD, Certified Kid’s Nutrition Specialist 29 Jun 2012 | 11:10 am Mum Mum’s recently discussed babies and sunscreen, and while you should avoid using sunscreen on babies under 6 months, after that the search for a good sunblock begins.   Sunscreen has been getting a lot of buzz lately, but unfortunately it hasn’t been good as the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recently released their 2012 Sunscreen Guide [...]

 Food Shaming Is Just Not For Me 
 zoot 12 Jul 2012 | 4:49 am It’s Not The What…It’s The How In the last month since I’ve decided to screw the scale and calorie-counting, I’ve learned a lot about my relationship with food. Mainly that it wasn’t/isn’t what I’m eating that is my greatest health hurdle…it’s how I’m eating it. It’s not my love of chicken tenders, or baking. It’s not Krispy Kreme donuts or potato chips. None of the unhealthy things that I love are what has given me nutritional concerns. It’s my relationship with food in general. I’ve always said that I… 
 I Mean, Really. You Can Only Eat So Many Almonds. 
 zoot 11 Jul 2012 | 3:08 am I’ve said here and there and everywhere before that I do NOT like eating plans/diets/whatever that prohibit certain items. No matter how much I actually like that item, I’ll instantly crave it non-stop if someone tells me I can’t have it. PERIOD. END OF STORY. Even if someone says,“I just gave up all fast food.”I’d be like,“I could go years without eating fast food, but the second you told me I had to stop? I’d want it for EVERY MEAL.”There’s one nutritional concept I have been thinking about a lot lately. The“Whole… 
 How I Became The“You’re AWESOME!”Lady 
 zoot 10 Jul 2012 | 2:59 am A long time ago, when I decided I wanted to make the world a little more awesome, I knew the first thing I would do was become better at was communicating the positive thoughts that cross my mind and do more to ignore the negative. Like, when I really like someone’s necklace I say,“I really like your necklace.”But, when I want to come home and talk about that one guy and his weird outfit? I pass. I do this for two reasons: 1. We All Tend To Be A Little Too Hard On Ourselves We all have voices inside of our heads that tell us the outfit we’re wearing makes us look…

 Open Letter To Balmain 
 12 Jul 2012 | 12:00 am Dear Balmain, You have lost your damn mind. You really expect someone to pay $6,435 for a tuxedo jumpsuit. The people who have the bodies to wear said jumpsuit probably can&apos;t afford it. And the people who can afford it, probably have more taste and real woman bodies. If something doesn&apos;t look good a model, it probably isn&apos;t going to look good on the rest of us. The jumpsuit reminds me of the denim jumpsuits that Jennifer Lopez wore during her J.Lo/ Love Don&apos;t Cost A Thing phase. I had truly hoped that fashion had moved on, but I guess I was wrong. Love You 
 I Love Barrettes 
 11 Jul 2012 | 12:00 am I always joke with the Grandmother that she better not go senile, because if she does I&apos;m going to make her start wearing barrettes. It&apos;s one of the things I miss most about not having a daughter. I really love the fabrics on this set of hair clips by Bibidi Badidi Bow. And Grandma? I think the fear of an old age filled with barrettes keeps her young and on her toes. 
 It&apos;s Hot!!! 
 10 Jul 2012 | 12:00 am A week of 100 degree plus days. I think I may actually live in the upper part of Hell. The weather isn&apos;t so great there, but at least there are pools. I plan on spending the next few days floating in the baby pool. And I want Winter to come back.

 Summer in Seattle 
 frisbeeflingers@gmail.com 20 Jun 2012 | 12:13 pm Seattle is the abusive boyfriend I just can’t quit. Most of the time he’s a complete dick. He’s moody, reclusive, a complete downer. My inner“solar powered unicorn”dies a bit every day I wake up and look outside.“Um, rain and clouds again, Dick?”Then, just when I’m starting to get the courage to really leave him for good, he pulls out his best charm. The mountains are visible. The sun peaks in the window at 6AM gently nudging me awake. He tells me I’m lovely and he woos me again. Everything is shiny and bubbly. He brings me flowers. He… 
 Based On A True Story. Or Not. 
 frisbeeflingers@gmail.com 27 Apr 2012 | 12:17 pm I’m sure you’ve read this story. Like a lot of the trends in the world I tend to be one of the last to catch up. So when I saw the picture of the black lab sleeping on a sofa with a heart felt story attached, I read it. I’m a sucker like that. I read the entire post*. I teared up at the end. It was a lovely story, I had to share this. I clicked“Share”when I realized I should check my facts first. One google search and I found out this wasn’t a true story at all. At first I was mad. Mad at Deb Green, whoever the hell that is, for posting a picture that… 
 Perception is NOT reality 
 frisbeeflingers@gmail.com 26 Apr 2012 | 12:04 pm My young son, mentioned previously, reminded me last night of another story I keep forgetting to tell you. He reminded me, as I lay him down in his twin bed, tucked him in, sang him a song, and promised to come back after reading to his sister, about this time I did not come back to check on him. In fact, he reminded me, I left him alone in the house for a very long time; a very long time while I was at the bus top. Did I remember that? he asked. Yes, I replied, I did. My daughter was in first grade, last year, and I had my tiny three year old son at home with me. He fell asleep in my bed…

 20 Amazing School Lunches for Kids 
 Tonya Staab 11 Jul 2012 | 5:55 am Can you believe that summer vacation is almost over for some students who return back to school as early as the end of July.  That is not our family though, our kids don’t start back until early September. I have a lot of friends whose children are starting kindergarten this fall, and we’ve recently been discussing school lunches.  We all would love to impress our children with elaborate Bento boxes, but in reality, most parents are incredibly busy, especially in the mornings, and are after lunches that are still fun, but also quick to make. I’ve rounded up 20 amazing… 
 Quotes of Love and Romance 
 Rebecca Graf 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am With flowers in bloom, it never fails that romance follows. Love fills the air. It could be new love with engagements and weddings. Or it could be seasoned love with anniversaries, renewing of vows, or just thankfulness for each other.With feelings of love comes poetic words that warm the heart. Here are just a few sayings of love to call forth the wings of love this season. Love is not blind–it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to see less.

 Seven Fabulous Centerpieces Full of Personality 
 Christine 6 Jul 2012 | 5:00 pm Centerpieces are…well, just that. The center of the table, around which friends and family gather to enjoy a meal together. They set the stage for grand dinner events, set the mood for weekend brunch gatherings, and set the tone for even the most modest of everyday family meals. So what makes for a fabulous centerpiece? Personality! Whimsy, spunk, elegance, modesty…as long as the centerpiece isn’t drab or nondescript, it’ll bring the WOW factor. Check out the following centerpieces…revel in their quirkiness and be inspired to bring some personality to your dining…

 Pet Portrait 
 8 Jul 2012 | 12:56 pm After a long break from any kind of art or drawing, my son drew this picture of our new cat &quot;Mishka&quot; today. I was so thrilled to see this side of him again, I just had to post it for you! I worried that his creative side was fading away. As you can see, I had nothing to worry about. Mommy is so very happy! 
 4th of July 2012 
 3 Jul 2012 | 4:21 pm Happy 4th everyone! Enjoy your day and be safe when using fireworks. We will be pet sitting and sedating dogs as usual. Many, many dogs including my own, hate the noise so it&apos;s a stressful day for us. Remember your pets this 4th and keep them safe and comfortable. 
 Summer Science Projects 
 19 Jun 2012 | 11:28 am image: USDA This summer we are planning some science projects involving local resources. First up will be collecting water samples and viewing their microscopic contents. My good friend, the local veterinarian, loaned us her extra microscope for our studies. We are so grateful for her assistance with extra supplies and learning materials, I would not have access to otherwise (not free anyway)! I found some great links online for identification and experiment ideas: Protist Park : Contains an introduction to Protists (pond life) and video gallery of mini movies and a cool short…

 Kaboo Fashion iPad Bags: Stylish and Protects Tablets 
 Jennifer Wagner 11 Jul 2012 | 12:46 pm I have been looking for a bag that looks like a pocketbook, yet could hold my iPad or Kindle, for ages. Everything I tried was either too big, too small, not enough pockets or not stylish. I finally found a bag that is perfect for my needs with Kaboo tablet bags. The Kaboo tablet bags are all beautiful bags that look like pocketbooks, not at all like tech bags. And although my bag doesn&apos;t appear to be overly large, it fits my iPad easily with plenty of room for everything else I carry around on a daily basis, without feeling too heavy. Kaboo offers four bag styles, each coming in two… 
 Cars, Traffic and Urbanization: What Ford is Doing 
 Jennifer Wagner 10 Jul 2012 | 9:58 am I was recently invited to return this year to another Ford Media conference, Go Further with Ford. As with last year&apos;s Go Forward with Ford, I learned a great deal about the future of cars and how Ford is responding to changing needs. This year my favorite session was on Urbanization: traffic, safety and owning a car versus renting. The speakers during the Urbanization session were Carol Coletta, named one of the world&apos;s 50 most important urban expers, and Gretchen Effgen, Zipcar&apos;s Director of Business. Coletta began with some interesting facts about cities in general: Cities offer more…

 Aspen Valley Half Marathon 
 7 Jul 2012 | 4:49 pm Last month while we were planning our trip to Colorado, I was browsing through the Aspen Times  and found a little reference to a half marathon happening a week after we arrived.  The fact that it was going to be run at 9,000 feet didn&apos;t quite register with me, because I saw the elevation map... This is the whole marathon map, but the half starts at around mile 7 and veers off from the full

 4 Jul 2012 | 10:49 am I&apos;m still here!!!  Whew.  The last 3-4 months have been a blur.  I won&apos;t bore you with details, but in short, H is now a high school graduate!  The last few months of school for her were a combination of frantic studying, finding out which colleges she was accepted to, deciding where to go (which involved a few repeat trips on both sides of the country), planning an Operation Smile 
 Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Updated Veggie Meat Loaf...SOOOO Good! 
 1 Mar 2012 | 7:16 am Last year I posted a vegetarian meatloaf that I made for my vegetarian daughter that even my red-meat loving husband would eat.  Shortly afterwards, my husband and I gave up meat as well, so the vegetarian meatloaf has become a staple in our house.  Without the fat from ground beef, the soy crumbles just didn&apos;t want to stick together.  It wasn&apos;t pretty, but it was delicious.  I have

 The Lost Week (or so) 
 Leslie 9 Jul 2012 | 9:02 pm This is my sorority sister BobbieJo and me. (I’m the cow. She’s the vampire.) She’s actually more than just my sorority sister, she’s my official“Big Sister.”(You get to pick just one.)(It’s a big deal.) There was a time when I was closer to her than anyone. We were roommates! She knew everything there was to know about me. I loved her deeply. I still do. But recently, all I knew about what was going on with her was what was written in her Christmas card. Then, on my birthday, I found her friend request on Facebook. It was my favorite gift that day. 
 House 
 Leslie 26 Jun 2012 | 9:14 am Yesterday, the girls were playing house. Julia was the mom, Emily; Lucy was the dad, Brandon; and Phoebe was the baby, Marigold. As Dave and I listened to them go on, I grew a little concerned. The mom was really mean and intense. And the dad was completely dense and ineffectual. Me:“Do you hear them? That’s not supposed to be us, is it?”Dave:“Nah. No. We’d never name our kid Marigold.”Julia (as Emily, from the next room):“Marigold, sweetheart? MARIGOLD! MARI-GOLD! Ugh, she just won’t listen. Get off the coffee table, Marigold! Okay…

 Leslie 25 Jun 2012 | 10:19 am Julia turned eight yesterday. All she wanted for her birthday was a telescope and a fondant cake in the shape of the solar system. (She even sketched it out for me.) It had been a while since I’d made a fondant cake and I needed some materials to get started, so I took myself to the store and this odd conversation happened as I checked out. Cashier:“Are you a cake maker?”Me:“Not really. I’m just making a cake for my daughter’s eighth birthday. I’m actually making her a space cake!”Cashier (stopped scanning and looked at me to pointedly ask):…

 Wishing You Were Here 
 BigLittleWolf 12 Jul 2012 | 5:41 am Exotic destination? Virtual vacation? Ever feel like you need to get away from it all–somehow? I suspect I could send my own postcard from the edge right now. Perhaps from a gorgeous beach on an exotic isle. From a small cabin shaded by old trees. (But not so remote that I’m deprived of an Internet connection.) Bora Bora sounds enticing. Then again, so does Miami with a Mai Tai. In fact, I could easily alternate between rowdy and restful resorts (in my mind), complete with geographically appropriate mixers and music…Salsa and Margueritas, Reggae and Rum Punch. And if… 
 Sex, Drugs, and Rock ‘n Roll 
 BigLittleWolf 11 Jul 2012 | 7:33 am I know my mother worried about it, though when she broached the subject–none too subtly–I’m not certain she believed me when I said simply, “I know better.” Sure, sometimes I rolled my eyes and shook my head when I answered, in part because I thought she knew me better. I didn’t drink. I didn’t do drugs. I didn’t screw around. But now that I’m a parent, and having dealt with adolescents for many years, I get it. I get the incessant worry, even if you basically do trust your teenager. I get the bigger picture view. I get the breadth of appalling possibilities…

We’re selling this place, and we’re living more simply.”Not the words I expect from Don Draper, and I wonder how it is that I’m witness to this private conversation. Well, somewhat private. It’s a small guestroom in a part of the Draper residence we don’t see on television, and the glam exec appears to be holding court with his current women – all of those who touch his life in some way–Megan and Betty, mother-in-law Marie in the background, and Sally sitting…

 Getting into the right mindset 
 Jen Lee Reeves 9 Jul 2012 | 3:41 pm This morning was the start of a new week-long summer camp. It’s Cameron’s fifth year attending Camp Invention but it’s Jordan’s first. That means a new environment, new kids and new questions. We’ve been through it many times before but it’s been a while since Jordan went into a totally new environment to meet new kids. (That was Kindergarten last August.) The camp director called me yesterday to just make sure she had all the information she needed to work with Jordan. Luckily I gave her my favorite piece of advice: Don’t offer to help unless she… 
 Jumping into the blog world 
 Jen Lee Reeves 7 Jul 2012 | 3:34 pm When you are a parent, you can feel alone even when there are all kinds of parents around you. There are hundreds of parenting books out there but in the end, it’s up to you to figure it all out. I’ve spent years figuring it out while blogging about it along the way. I started in 2004 and it really picked up in speed and need after Jordan was born. This site has been a space where I’ve fleshed out how to deal with staring, helping Jordan learn to mourn her own differences and finding wonderful ways to connect with other families in the special needs world. There is Facebook… 
 A growing, yet fractured, community 
 Jen Lee Reeves 5 Jul 2012 | 10:11 pm I’ve talked about the special needs world during public speeches and here on this site regarding a constantly changing face of the community. Social networking is a huge reason why so many more families and members of the special needs world can connect with each other. I have learned SO much from so many other parents and special needs adults. I wouldn’t be the advocate I am today without social networking. But there’s another side of it. It’s not very pretty. It’s a side where some people think it’s fun to abuse the respect and kindness that is easy to…

 9 things not to miss this summer 
 Kate 8 Jul 2012 | 9:01 pm Written by guest contributor Kate Tietje of Modern Alternative Mama. It’s summer. Time for lazy days and cricket-filled nights. It’s the beauty of summer, really – not having so many activities, getting to move at a slower pace, and spending your time doing what you really enjoy. As you’re focusing on the wonderful laziness, though, there are some moments that only the summer brings that you definitely don’t want to miss. These are the moments that will make memories for your children…that may have made memories for you growing up. Savor them, enjoy them, and make the most of…

 26 Jun 2012 | 1:51 pm We left on vacation almost a week ago. I was envisioning beach fun under the sun, turquoise waters, diving back into writing and long naps. Instead Tropical Storm Debbie landed and wrapped us up in her vise of wild winds, stormy seas and torrential rain. We are on the other side of it now, but without power. The storm has passed . It looks like we won&apos;t have power for several more days. We&apos;ve been shelling on the beach, cooking and eating dinner by candlelight, and swimming in an ocean of crashing waves . Today they let us over the bridge, and we journeyed over to the mainland to charge our… 
 No one else can do it for her. It is hers. She owns it. 
 31 May 2012 | 2:19 pm She has many selves within her. Some constant, some not. Her writer self has been in a dormant stage, cocooning away on quick snatches of reading escapades - fit into a world so busy that she&apos;s not sure sometimes if she can keep moving forward. But, she does... These last weeks of wrapping up another school year for her children are a juggle fest of working full-time, multiple school events, baseball play-offs, and volunteering. Life is full. At first she raged inwardly at the injustice of not having enough time to write. Then she stewed and wept. Now? She&apos;s feeling… 
 Neglect of self is unbecoming in its blatant abandonment of the soul 
 3 May 2012 | 11:36 pm When we allow the world to pass us by at a record clip, our lives lose color and flavor. Clarity does not come from the absence of color, but more from an abundance of varied shades. The nuances allow us to rise and dip...flowing into a rhythm with context. In opposition, Colorless is a world that loses shape and contour from a life of busy. Whether the lipstick index holds validity in today&apos;s economy or not... sometimes the gift of color brought to you in a small package is all it takes to boost your spirits. Spending $2 or $20 on that little tube of tint somehow makes the world a bit…

 You Capture | Summer 
 Beth 10 Jul 2012 | 7:13 am Hi friends. I’m sorry this is a day late. Mondays sometime slip through my fingers, which is exactly what happened yesterday. I hope you understand! Did you all have fun capturing summer? I did. Mostly with my iPhone, but that’s totally okay. Last week on the 4th, my parents came over for dinner and neighborhood fireworks. They were great baby holders, too. Oh, dinner and dessert. (some of you were wondering about Reese’s s’mores. Rather than using Hershey’s chocolate bars, try a peanut butter cup. SO GOOD.) PB Cup s’mores aren’t just a sign of summer…

 Beth 6 Jul 2012 | 11:14 am I have to be honest with all of you. I’m not drinking coffee right now and it’s not Friday morning. It’s Friday afternoon, I just had a chicken salad sandwich and I’m drinking ice water. Clara is napping, Eli is playing with Lisa, the sitter, I just gave Noah a haircut (outside) and made him take a shower, he’s now on a computer and Anna is playing at her friends house (she just painted her toes in the coolest colors, she has an amazing sense of fashion.)

 Beth 2 Jul 2012 | 11:21 am Hi friends. I hope you had a great time capturing feet. I know, for me, capturing feet meant being next to squishy little babies. I consider myself to be very lucky. These feet belong to my client’s son who is one day older than Clara, he’s a very handsome and fun fellow with amazing blue eyes. And also cute feet, obvs. Clara actually doesn’t mind being in the grass, which i find to be interesting. Both Noah and Eli disliked sitting directly in the grass when they were babies, so this is a nice treat. She also loves to eat grass, so that’s awesome. And finally, Clara…

 The Power of Forgiveness 
 kristen 12 Jul 2012 | 4:44 am I shared with you her beautiful story. I’ve seen the transformation with my own eyes. It’s breathtaking. But hearing it in her own words, seeing her chubby son, thrive, it leaves me speechless. And it reminds me what I need to hear the most today: He is good and this is His. If you’re holding onto unforgiveness today, let it go.“To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.”-Lewis Smedes The Power of Forgiveness is a post from: We are THAT Family The Vintage Pearl Beautiful hand-stamped jewelry Professional Design-&quot;Red Leaf… 
 WFMW: That Bugs (Instant and Natural Itch Relief) 
 kristen 10 Jul 2012 | 7:38 pm We spent the last few weeks sleeping with our windows open under mosquito nets. We are still taking malaria medicine because in many countries, mosquitos leave more than a bothersome itch, they deliver debilitating malaria. Even with taking precautions, we still have a few bug bites. My five year old is especially sensitive (and whiny) about those itchy spots. I quickly learned that rubbing a bar of soap over an itchy spot offers instant relief! After verifying it online, I found a host of tips to help defeat the dreaded itch that often accompanies summer. That works for me! Jetlag, however,… 
 Sometimes I Don’t Want to Be Brave 
 kristen 10 Jul 2012 | 1:03 am Nearly three weeks ago, the night before we left for Kenya, I let my fear get the best of me. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t keep the worries away. The what-ifs filled my heart, my mind, the room. I trembled. I woke my sleeping husband and asked him to help me fight my fears. I sobbed into my pillow as he prayed for peace to cover me. When someone peers into my life from the outside, sees that I was bold enough to try and start something from nothing, dares to take my young children into a third world country, they say,“you are brave.”And my fear, just under the surface,…

 Remember the plaigiarist I had in 2008 turned con artist? Yup.MORE victims and a new name: Maliya Bergman. Yippee. 
 loralee 10 Jul 2012 | 9:42 pm Remember the plagiarist that was reveled to me in 2008 about this time? I’m writing because she’s apparently opened up shop AGAIN only changed her name. Probably because my blog is the top thing you find when you google her name. What used to be Mia Szazbo Bergman(married to Ben Bergman) is now going by the moniker Maliya Bergman with a new blog: http://bouquetofbubbly.blogspot.com/ Well, we found out as people investigated that it was a LOT more than just  plagiarism. This woman is one of the most heartless women ever to walk the earth. I continually hear from her victims and… 
 HOWDY! 
 loralee 3 Jul 2012 | 5:54 pm I know it’s been quite some time since I posted but there is a really good reason why. I HAVE BEEN LIVING MY LIFE! I’ve managed to get the farmer’s market on Saturday with my family. I often cook at least the family meal at dinner (and often more). I work in my little garden and try to keep it watered and maintained. I haven’t managed to keep my ENTIRE house clean all at once but I often clean the downstairs level before I go to bed. (And breathe in the loveliness of it before the hurricanes known as my children can wake up and mess it up the next day.) (THAT said, I… 
 Our family is returning to the Mormon church next month. (Yes, that cracking sound you heard was hell freezing over.) 
 loralee 12 Jun 2012 | 1:03 am *Edited to include an acknowledgement of perhaps the funniest typo ever  :) Yes,  it’s true…As soon as Aaron turns 3 next month, my family and I are returning to the Mormon church after about a 9-year absence. It’s been something that my husband and I have been talking about years and very seriously  for the last 3-years….ever since Butterlump was born. Even though my husband and I didn’t attend church we made sure that our children went with their grandparents. THEY LOVE IT. LOVE. Even the 16-year-old. However, my little one is about to start turn three and…

 Rotbart’s Rules of Order 
 Scary Mommy 10 Jul 2012 | 6:30 am Harley Rotbart is a pediatrician, parenting writer, and dad of 3 semi-launched kids. He and his wife empty nest in Denver, CO. Harley’s new book, No Regrets Parenting, is a time management blueprint for stressed-out parents. The New York Times called it “something special.” Read his blog, and more about the book, at No Regrets Parenting. I dedicate this to Jill and Lou. Jill is Jill Smokler, a.k.a. Scary Mommy, who has again kindly given me space on her website to embarrass myself. Her Confessions of a Scary Mommy is the inspiration, of course, for the title of this post, but also… 
 Mommy Porn (for the rest of us) 
 Scary Mommy 5 Jul 2012 | 6:58 am I found myself at a party last weekend, full of couples and families. Once the kids were out of earshot, conversation turned, like it has so many times over the past few months, to Fifty Shades of fucking Grey. The room quickly divided between the couples whose sex lives it changed for the positive and those whose it hasn’t. Sadly for my husband, we remained on the latter side, staring back at the rosy cheeked (pun, intended) and giddy couples. I have heard again and again from a nauseating number of friends and family how utterly amazing the book has been for them and I’m sick to… 
 Momfinitions, Part II 
 Scary Mommy 3 Jul 2012 | 12:27 pm  It’s time for a new round of Momfinitions, based on my recent absence and subsequent return to my darling children. Parental Immunity: The fact that the more you are around your children, the more immune you become to their annoying behavior. This is evidenced when one parent returns home from work or a trip and incredulously asks the other one,“are the kids always this annoying?’and is met with a blank stare. Yes. They are. Parental Amnesia: The inevitable feeling of forgetting just how annoying your children are once you are away from them.

 PROMPTuesday #198: About Last Night 
 San Diego Momma 10 Jul 2012 | 9:05 am  Please to enjoy the fuzzy and dismal quality of this sub-par video. I pointedly chose this writing exercise today because I’ve been horribly awful keeping up with anything fun this summer. Although I haven’t had the minutes to visit the prompt submissions and generally contribute, I don’t want to abandon these prompts because they’re woven into my blog’s fabric so intimately. So, an easy one: What did you do last night? I seem to find that in writing minutiae something profound or telling usually emerges, but even if not, just… 
 My Other Ghost Story: Updated 
 San Diego Momma 4 Jul 2012 | 9:38 am  I first sensed something odd Memorial Day weekend. It was Sunday, and The Rock and the kids spent the day at a friend’s picnic while I caught up on work at home. Around five or so, I put the computer away and collapsed on the couch to clear my head. I’m not sure what first caught my attention, but the hallway directly in front of me, the stretch of floor leading to the kitchen, seemed to flutter for a brief second. I lifted my head to look expecting to see—a bird? A fly? Carol Anne?—and instead, shadows threw themselves at the red wall, which was nothing new…

 San Diego Momma 26 Jun 2012 | 8:23 am Man, I’d love to write regularly here again, read you all, and comment. I suppose I must realize that as a freelancer, I’ll never have enough time and that the word“free”is both evil and a Godsend. So you know how some days you’re just done and sit in front of the TV for some dumb time and something comes on that you’re too tired to turn? (Another symptom of doneness is when you drop the kids off at camp and make it all the way home without realizing you’ve been singing“Old MacDonald”the entire time. And that you didn’t…

 Trend to try: Bright Coloured Jewellery 
 admin 11 Jul 2012 | 7:28 pm As always, there are plenty of fun new fashion trends this season. But I have particularly fallen head over heels with the bright coloured jewellery trend. (Photo by ImaxTree via stylebistro.com) Seen last year at London Fashion Week 2012, Sass and Bide styled their spring collection with these amazingly vibrant neckpieces with intricate almost tribal details. I love that they can be worn with blacks and neutral colours (of which my wardrobe is full of). It can be worn with neutral or colourful patterned or print outfits (which is also on trend). And it can go with outfits featuring big…

 Sleeping in space 
 Nap Warden 11 Jul 2012 | 8:28 pm For the most part, we are not doing summer camps this year. When you have two kiddos, most of them come out to about $1,000 a week! I am just not there right now...That being said, I do think it&apos;s important for them to not have every moment of every day structured.Today, we went to the library and checked out an Adler Planetarium pass. The kiddos had a BLAST!Miss Peach will now demonstrate for you how an astronaut sleeps in space... 
 Think happy thoughts... 
 Nap Warden 8 Jul 2012 | 8:05 pm I lost my computer for SIX DAYS last week!Think about that...six days...It&apos;s a long and sorted tale about logic boards which used to be graphic cards, and wiping computers clean and installing new operating systems that results in my poor MacBook Pro spending 6 days in the hands of Apple Care.So...now I&apos;m playing catch up...and thinking happy thoughts (see above)Do I remember a time before computers???

 Video poker in versione digitale 
 molly 28 Apr 2012 | 6:32 am I video-poker sono uno di quei fenomeni che non hanno lunga vita, ma che sembrano impazzare sia online che dal vivo. Il fenomeno del video-poker almeno in Italia non è conosciuto che da qualche anno e da quando sono state introdotte le macchinette all’interno dei bar, la gente è diventata matta per questo tipo di gioco. Non esiste una casistica che possa racchiudere il tipico giocatore di video poker, infatti amano giocare donne e uomini, ragazze e ragazzi e questo perché il gioco è molto semplice, veloce e creato appositamente per un pubblico variegato. Ovviamente le versioni live…

 Classy Chaos 
 
 Moving 
 10 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm We move in two weeks. I&apos;ve spent all of my free hours packing and organizing twelve years of our lives in Cleveland. Oooff. Good news is that I finally found Feenie&apos;s baby book that is totally and utterly empty. Not even a mention of her birth date has been scribbled in the fancy book. Side note: let&apos;s say, hypothetically of course, that a parent forgot to document birth weight&amp;forgot to document birth time of their third child - can that terrible, horrible, very bad parent call up the hospital or county records to ask? One empty room at a time, I&apos;m faced with reality. We are really moving. 
 Fingers crossed, we&apos;ll be back to South Haven soon. 
 2 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm We just came back from what the kiddos dubbed &quot;the best vacation ever&quot;. Forget about Costa Rica, Paris, Poland, Mexico, Canada and Disney World - South Haven, Michigan is where they would like to vacation all the time. It doesn&apos;t take much for them to call something &quot;the best ever&quot; (short term memory for the win). Before South Haven their number one destination was the Appalachian foothills of Ohio. But I have to agree with them on this one, Michigan was one of our best vacations ever and just a skip away from our home in Cleveland. You guys? The beaches were unlike any we&apos;ve seen on our…

 keeping it real 
 stacy 29 Jun 2012 | 10:20 am There’s been moving and healing in my heart this year and recently things have shifted into the mind. I am figuring a lot of things out, sifting them between my heart and mind, trying things on for size, moving between the world of ephemera and intuition and inspiration to the world of planning and applications and doing. Back and forth, finding balance, and keeping it real. here i am a couple of weeks ago at the beach. still in braids, though they’re longer now on my mind ~ Busy. New activities (for me and the kids), new people, new ideas. Lots of phone calls, lots of meetings… 
 The Tape-Covered Gift 
 stacy 28 Jun 2012 | 7:35 am The other day I told Orlando to stop acting like a two-year-old. I heard the words come flying out of my mouth—in frustration, out of mis-expectation, and in the end, weighted with meaninglessness. As if I could sprinkle magic maturity dust upon him, as if I wanted to. Later I had the idea to give myself some homework. I decided to watch home videos of him when he was two years old. I woke up early and turned on the computer. I was inundated with hundreds—thousands!—of photos, of both kids, back from ancient times. I was laughing and crying, and Rom, who was trying to…

 75th Anniversary 
 LaLaLaura 27 Jun 2012 | 4:55 pm I was just looking at the calendar and realized it was my grandparents’wedding anniversary. Then I started doing the math and realized this would be their 75th anniversary! They had a big 50th celebration the summer following my freshman year of high school–hard to believe that was (gulp) 25 years ago already. My grandparents have been gone for years now–I sure miss them. My grandfather, especially–he was the most awesome, amazing, sweet, funny, kickass person I have ever known in my whole life. I so wish my children could have known him. This picture obviously…

 way to be a grownup! 
 Casey 7 Jul 2012 | 12:26 pm I may be 30, but I most certainly do not feel 30. I still get really excited about things I was never allowed to do as a kid or things I wasn’t able to do in our early years of marriage. The Mold-A-Rama is a perfect example of“Wait, I’M THE GROWNUP, I can totally do that if I want to.”I feel the same guilty pleasure whenever I let myself get a treat and a drink when I stop at the gas station by myself. I also love hailing cabs. I grew up only seeing cabs in movies so when it came time to hail my first cab in Chicago I had my form down: right leg out, chin up, right…

 Casey 4 Jul 2012 | 7:52 pm Holidays are getting really hard for me. I miss my family tremendously but even more so on holidays, today included. It doesn’t help that it’s been so dry out here that fireworks were cancelled, what’s the Fourth of July without fireworks? Kind of lame, that’s what. But then again there’s thousands of people who aren’t at home tonight because their homes are in danger of burning down from wildfires. Somebody always has it worse. Which is why I feel awfully ungrateful pouting about missing my family. At this very moment they’re finishing up a dinner of…

 Keeping Cool 
 11 Jul 2012 | 12:29 pm The heat is finally creeping over to the West Coast. We&apos;ve had a pretty mild summer so far. In honor of sunny days ahead I sat last night and made some sun coasters. Wasabi Girl thought they were cute, but when I gave one to Drama Girl to put under her drink, she asked if it was cheese. I guess they look a little like that marbled cheddar/mozzarella cheese you can get at the store. Knowing our family, these will probably be called the &apos;cheese coasters&apos; from now on. *sigh* Hope you&apos;re keeping cool!

Apparently I have about zero self-control when it comes to starting new projects. I was only going to put a few stitches in but it took off. You can&apos;t tell at the moment, but there are lots of bugs and snakes that will be whirling in the smoke. I&apos;ve just started the caldron itself.

 Design Wall Monday: Farmer&apos;s Wife 8 blocks 
 9 Jul 2012 | 8:33 am My &quot;Farmer&apos;s Wife&apos;s Midlife Crisis&quot; Jubilee quilt only got four more blocks this week. I still have barely dipped into my stash of hot pinks and I&apos;m having a lot of fun with it. I&apos;m too lazy to work from templates so I&apos;m just doing the math for each block in my head. I&apos;ll need to use templates for some of the more difficult blocks. The farmer&apos;s wife in my imagination is not a shy person. She mixes her batiks with mind-bending geometrics with florals. She likes pinks so hot they&apos;re almost red. But she still likes the occasional sweet cherry print. As… 

 
 The Stephford Diaries 
 
 To our neighbors: 
 Steph 12 Jul 2012 | 7:36 am So, how’s everything? Is that new baby sleeping through the night yet? I hope so. Man, a toddler and a newborn all at once? I’m sure that’s exhausting. Y’all are definitely braver than I am. Even the idea of that has me on my knees thanking God I had a hysterectomy. But here’s the thing–you still have two dogs, Oscar and Olive. They’re lovely little doxies. They’re well-mannered little things, too. Except when they come dig in our trash or poop in our yard or pee on things in our garage when we happen to leave that door open. But I’m not…

He’s clearly a personal trainer, and I’ve been dying to talk to him for about a month now. My fear and insecurity kept me from doing so. Today, I finally nutted up. I mean, what’s the WORST that’s going to happen? He laughs in my face, maybe says something nasty about fat people? Big friggin’deal. I can handle that. But what if he DOESN’T do those things? What if he’s willing to help? What if I can afford his…

 The Benefits of Part Time Work for Mothers 
 admin 9 Jul 2012 | 9:06 am In the modern world it is believed women can have it all–the gorgeous husband, the beautiful children, the big house and the high powered job. But this belief doesn’t stop many new mothers feeling guilty about returning to work and leaving their child with family or a babysitter. Not only is there a nagging guilt that their child will miss them and miss bonding with them but also the fear they will miss their child’s important miles stones, their first steps, their first words, the instances parents want to be there for.

 Dogs Do Bite – Teaching Your Child How Not to be Bitten 
 admin 23 Jun 2012 | 5:33 am Whether you have a dog at present or whether you plan to get one for your household in the near future it is important that you teach your children what they need to do in order to avoid getting bitten. Even if you have no pets your children will be in contact with dogs at some point in time and need to be taught how to properly behave around them. Dogs do not bite for any reason. Most often it happens because they are provoked in some manner and feel the need to defend themselves. This is natural instinct kicking in. When they do bite it is most often because they are fearful of being…

 admin 22 Jun 2012 | 3:05 am Women should always try to find hair styles that make them feel confident and good about their appearance. Achieving a cute hair style every morning with curlers or a straightener does not have to take hours.

 Do Dogs and Cats Have a Dominant Paw? My 6th Grader Needs Your Help To Find Out 
 Danielle Thompson 13 Apr 2012 | 8:22 pm My daughter is very much interested in animals, and so it seemed natural for her to plan a science fair project that would answer a question that she had: Do dogs and cats have a dominant paw - similar to people being left-handed or right-handed? She is looking for some help in gathering her data. Can you help? She created this quick explanation of her &quot;experiment&quot; and a form for you to enter your pet&apos;s info. She needs to finish up before the end of the month. This will only take a few minutes, and we have found it to be pretty easy and fun!

 A Tourist in My Own Hometown 
 MomGrind 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am It&apos;s strange to visit your own country and feel like a tourist, but that has been my experience on our last family visit to Israel. It suddenly dawned on me that I have spent more of my adult life in California than in Israel, which might explain why California feels more and more like home, while Israel is becoming this exotic place that you visit once a year, armed with a camera and lots of patience - it&apos;s an intense place and Israelis are generous and kind, but quite aggressive. Being a tourist in your own country is not all bad though - you get to do the really fun stuff, the stuff that… 
 Giveaway: Pastry Shoes (Closed) 
 MomGrind 9 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Pastry shoes are pastry-colored athletic shoes from Angela and Vanessa Simmons, who are apparently the stars of some reality show, but since I don&apos;t watch reality shows, the name of the show means little to me. However, upon receiving an email from the company&apos;s representative asking me if I would agree to a review and a giveaway of the shoes, I looked at the company&apos;s website and realized that while I&apos;m way too old for these shoes, my pre-teen girls are going to love them.

 Missing Grandma 
 MomGrind 13 May 2012 | 10:35 am How fitting that today, Mother&apos;s Day, is the yahrzeit (Yiddish for &quot;a year&apos;s time,&quot; anniversary) of the passing of my beloved grandmother, Chava. Grandma passed away young, at the age of 59, when I was barely 12 years old. I think about her often, because she was the epitome of motherhood. A large woman (back when most people were not overweight) with a big heart, her entire existence centered around her children, her grandchildren, and cooking. I write about grandma with some difficulty, because I was so young when she passed. I so wish she could have stayed with us a little longer, giving…

 The road to fitness is paved with a red face and sweat and boobs in my face. 
 admin 10 Jul 2012 | 6:26 am A few weeks ago I was thinking how much I would like to have a yoga class again. Yoga suits me. It is slow, I can stretch, it forces me to focus, it’s individual. It’s not readily available in small town amenity-lacking-ville. Suddenly, it was there. A facebook post of a class beginning showed up. Yay! Last night was the first night. I pulled out my mat, the one that had sat in the closet for four years, waiting. I confidently walked into the class in my shorts and snug tshirt. I assumed I would know how to do everything. Wrong, wrong, wrongity wrong. The teacher was new, this was… 
 Still throwin’down over panties. 
 admin 8 Jul 2012 | 7:46 am I’m still throwing down with you about getting the ugly out of your life. Knickers and all. That underwear drawer was a starting point for me. I keep thinking of you while I wander stores. I know Amanda got rid of the ugly and found that a week without kids is a good reason to get back to, ahem, basics, with her husband. You can get new, black, non ugly underwear for 97 CENTS at“the Walmarts”my friends. They don’t even SHOW the 97 cent panties online, but LOOK–even online you can find 2 dollar non ugly knickers.  Soma is having a sale where you can get 5…

 Annette 1 Jun 2012 | 7:01 am I’ve been trying to take my own advice and really look around at my surroundings for interesting things to photograph. I decided to search for the ugliest thing in my neighborhood–and realized that it’s all of the manhole and drainage covers! Those are probably the most obvious eyesore in every neighborhood! Since I had never really taken a close look at drain covers before it didn’t occur to me that they actually have some design elements to them! I took a series of funky shots and prettied them up with app filters. I kinda really love the patterns and orange/rust…

You know, you never hear anyone say that they love their intestines. You know why? Because if they work well you take them for granted! You only hear from those of us who hate our guts. And whose guts hate them back. When my gallbladder up and quit on me I thought my…

 Would You Buy A Bikini Onesie For Your Little One? 
 Patty Garza 10 Jul 2012 | 12:34 am This bikini onesie is stirring up anger and protests by several parents after it was discovered in a Mississippi department store. A similar incident stirred up controversy when a new line of kids lingerie was put out by a French clothing designer last year. This has to be a gag gift for anyone having a child or who has a baby that wears onesis. Why would any sane parent want to dress their infant in a onesie that has the body figure&amp;shape of a grown woman?? Unless they are a sick pervert and have pedpohile tendencies?? Do you think this onesie bikini goes too far or is…

 Happy Declaration of Independence Day 
 Patty Garza 4 Jul 2012 | 6:38 pm As we celebrate 236 years of Independence from Great Britain and the rule of tyranny. We should remember and teach our children why we are free and why we are celebrating independence. We Are A Moral Country Founded On ChristianityOur founders knew we were not a theocracy, but they placed value on a higher authority and morals. As John Adams said, &quot;Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&quot;Our Declaration of Independence reaffirms this in the statement: &quot;A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act…

 Was it the Toe Twigs? 
 Rima 2 Jul 2012 | 5:27 pm I’ve always been one of those mothers you see running after her kid brandishing a wet wipe. But last week, at Lithuanian camp, I perfected the art of embarrassing my children. You see, every year at camp (also sometimes during the Saturday school Christmas pageant and at the occasional cocktail party) my friend V and I do a little schtick. The schtick changes depending on the venue, but it’s always built around our stock characters–her John Cleese to my Hugh Laurie. This year, one of our evening programs at camp was a full-out Lithuanian folk dance-off and my friend V and… 
 My Broken Diddly-Squat 
 Rima 14 Jun 2012 | 7:50 pm Is there anything more horrifying than the sound of an AC repairman yelling up from the basement:“Can you come down here for a second, Mrs. Rama? I want to show you something.”That something always turns out to be a mechanical part, about yea long and yea wide, which is fried beyond repair. The part is so damaged, in fact, that the AC repair person simply cannot get over it.“I’ve seen a lot of people run their AC into the ground, Mrs. Rama, but whooooo-wheee (produces a low whistle) this is really something else.”The repairman encourages me to come closer…

I have a Lithuanian national costume and am getting ready for February 16th. I go to Lithuanian (school) and have not forgotten how to speak Lithuanian yet. When I come home from school I usually wash my hands and have a snack. Then I go watch some TV. My favorite game is“Barbie Dolls.”You see, they are little…

 scarbie doll 18 Jun 2012 | 6:44 pm You have been in and out of bed about 13 times since I tucked you in. You ask for water, say you have &quot;the snuffies,&quot; you need me and only I will do. I know this is all a ploy, dear Girl Who Cried Wolf, but I give in, time and again. I will take this nightly dance with you, because it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got after the long work day. I don&apos;t want to need you needing me, but you needing me is so fleeting that I cling to it like a raft. I lay next to you while your brother tosses and turns in the bunk above, noisily slurping that thumb that he won&apos;t give up in the night. I close my eyes, thinking it will…

But Loogoo is in only a pull-up and shaking her booty and saying Gord-knows-what over and over. She recently cut her own hair into a mullet, which I&apos;ve slowly cropped into a po-mo Dorothy Hamill in an attempt to even it out.

Not at all. I&apos;m over the moon at the experience I&apos;m gaining, where my career is heading, how much I get along with my boss and my editorial team. Love doesn&apos;t even cut it.

Since then, the self professed“food history nerd”asked me to help her design a new sister site, The History Kitchen, a website“dedicated to exploring all facets of food history, from Mesopotamian meals to ancient Israelite recipes to Renaissance cooking to the cocktails of Mad Men, and everything in between.”It is extremely exciting to be a part of Tori’s vision.

After scanning her fresh and colorful vegan Mason Jar salad photos and recipe suggestions I am making a list for our local farmer’s market and grocery. And hey, if Mason Jars do well for lunch, why not breakfast too?

 Herbal Insect Repellent from Turtle Moon Health (Review&amp;Giveaway)

He told me to“Get up!”I asked“Why? He pulled out the bench I was sitting on to reveal 4 or 5 tiny bee hives. Yikes. I was literally sitting on a powder keg. So much for a relaxing reading spot! The next day I armed myself–I wasn’t going to let myself get stung, or bothered by any bugs for that matter. I sprayed my arms and legs with an insect repellent before going out with my kids to walk the…

 MothersTouch Forehead Thermometer (Giveaway)

And if there’s one thing they dislike just as much as taking medicine it’s sitting still long enough for me to take their temperature. I’ve tried various thermometers in the last few years, but the MothersTouch Forehead Thermometer ($29) I received recently has been the quickest and simplest by far. The Mother’s Touch works like a ring that you place around your finger and then press to your child’s forehead (near the temple). To use it, just press the on/off button and wait for 2…

I could list thousands of things I&apos;d rather do than go swimsuit shopping, and watching every single episode of Dora the Latina Whore is on that list. Do you get the sense that I hate swimsuit shopping? Because I more than hate it. &quot;Loathing&quot; comes to mind, but that&apos;s not really a strong enough word. Even in high school swimsuits were High Drama. It didn&apos;t matter that I was a puny size 4, because the cousins are most definitely NOT a size 4. I… 
 The Fluffernutter Is Growing Up 
 burghbaby 9 Jul 2012 | 5:22 pm If I were a little more organized, there would have been a countdown. &quot;23 days 14 hours and 32 minutes until Penny outgrows the Raging Lunatic Stage!&quot; would have been written on a sign and updated every single minute of every single day until she hit the six month mark. Alas, her half birthday passed without fanfare. Unless, of course, you count that day I looked over at her and went, &quot;Hey. You&apos;re not quite as much of a raging lunatic as you were. You must be six months old now. Happy half birthday, flufferpup.&quot; Then I turned back to my very important chips and dip conundrum. Why do I NEVER…

 Tips to get extra space in your bathroom 
 Alina 10 Jul 2012 | 3:27 am Lack of space is a common problem today because the flats are getting smaller and smaller budget of families. Some of the rooms where space is always missing in the bathroom, especially in small rooms typical of today’s homes, which are super comfortable when, clean, but a real headache when you save everything you need. A good idea to get extra space in your bathroom are the hangers for the storage, which are small boxes that hang on the wall where you can put all kinds of things, from body creams and hair accessories. You can find them at any store decor or furniture. In addition to… 
 Betting on neon colors in the decor of your home 
 Alina 9 Jul 2012 | 6:29 am If you renew your home giving it some color, today we bring you the perfect choice. The shades of neon are creating trend in both fashion and makeup and the world of decoration. This is the ideal colors for housing and striking live. With neon colors you can highlight all the areas or rooms that are more boring, getting up the mood of a room with neutral colors or off. However, it is very important that you do not abuse them. Therefore, it is best to use in points key, for example, window sills or doors. On the other hand, it is advisable to contrast these colors with white or similar shades. 
 The best choice for sofa beds 
 Alina 7 Jul 2012 | 3:45 am More than once we had to stay and sleep on the sofa bed of a friend, or why not a relative, and consequently had a painful awakening and spent the next three days as if we were given a good beating. But not all are uncomfortable sofa bed, that’s a myth; there are sofa bed that can provide comfort and security when sleeping. This type of furniture is very necessary to get us out of trouble when we have to accommodate visitors, and we can combine this utility with a good quality of sleep, erasing these myths that say that there is nothing more uncomfortable to sleep on a sofa bed. Also,… 

 
 Cowgirl Yoga 
 
 Would you check email here? 
 6 Jul 2012 | 10:10 am Aahhhhh, summer...when I am too busy livin&apos; it to blog about it. Although I would adore more time to reflect, I can&apos;t complain. After our first two Cowgirl Yoga retreats of the season, the fam and I spent a few days in Yellowstone before heading to Red Rock Ranch for a week of CY, dude-ranch style. Now we&apos;re in the hot heartland of America visiting husband&apos;s family for a few days. Then it&apos;s back to Cowgirl Yoga life and back hOMe to Montana. Is it really July already?!There&apos;s a lot to be said for disconnecting, and reconnecting to nature, family, and the myriad of enjoyable pursuits that… 
 Cowgirls vs. Cancer 2012 Retreat

This is the first year that we have dedicated an entire retreat to C vs. C, thanks to the generosity of everyone we work with at Cowgirl Yoga. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for all the people who donated their time and energy to making this program grow and come to life in rich new ways.

 Trying to Find My Rose-Colored Glasses 
 Heather 15 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am We take things for granted. We&apos;re healthy, for the most part. We have a nice home. We have clothing in excess. We have many luxuries: Ipad, Kindle Fires, fancy DSLRs, laptops, Roku, cable TV...so much more. My kids need nothing more. They have everything they need, yet they still ask for more and more wants. They are supremely lucky, but, as kids are, they don&apos;t know how lucky they are. They have friends who have been adopted out of terrible conditions. Heck, they have a family member adopted out of less-than-ideal conditions. I tell them the stories, and they seem grateful for a moment, then… 
 The Grass is Always Greener 
 Heather 29 May 2012 | 5:19 am Mostly frivolous things I would change if I could: I would have light blonde curly hair. (I had light blonde hair as a child but it&apos;s very dark brown...and some grey...now.) I&apos;d not have asthma and I&apos;d be a natural runner. Running seems like a wonderful and relaxing activity, but it&apos;s never been natural to me. As a kid I suspected I had asthma but it was never so bad that I brought it up with my parents. (See also: I&apos;m stoopid.) Small talk would be second nature. I would not need contacts or glasses. I would have had natural labors with all of my children. It was the plan with our first, but… 
 Memories and friends 
 Heather 22 May 2012 | 5:30 am Snippets of memories come to me at odd times. D sneaks into my purse to score a Tic Tac. I remember asking my Grandma for a Certs or a Vitamint. She almost always carried one or the other. We remember my Grandpa: holding me in his legs, reading me bedtime stories with the book upside down, going for &quot;rides&quot; only to pull into the garage from the end of the driveway. My mom and the kids and I visited the city where my dad grew up a few weeks ago. We vaguely remembered the path to the farm where my dad was raised. We found it. I had only my cell phone to take a distant photo. I learned to always…

 rambling 
 jess 4 Jul 2012 | 2:23 pm There is something about the summer that brings a certain melancholy. When i was little i never had very many friends and often preferred to be alone. I would wander through the trails in the canyon near my home, sit at the rivers edge, just sort of drift through the summer letting myself get lost in the heat and the hours. My daughter spends entire days in her room, curtains drawn, headphones on. Texting and facebooking simultaneously. Then, suddenly, she will leap from her bed, bikini’d and smiling and run to the lake. No matter the weather or time of day. I have a summer cold. It is… 
 random thoughts and a month of birthdays

I’ve had a whole cluster of sudden-onset migraines and three migraines that have left me mostly blind in a pool of cold sweat on the bathroom floor. It sucks. I’m frustrated because i feel like“Hey! I just ran a marathon, i should be super healthy.”But, it is what it is and i’m trying to figure out what is triggering all of this (aside from work stress.) I took three weeks off running and am now back in the game with a registration for the Victoria Marathon in October signed and sealed. It’s got a great jacket…

 Wordless Wednesday – Grand Generation Gap 
 valmg 11 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am Over the weekend there was a small car club gathered nearby. I was driving by on the way from picking my oldest son up when I saw a lovely old Mustang and had to stop and take a look. I also saw a really old Ford, that I know my Dad would love. Then my son pointed out the car that he liked. Yes, that there is a Lamborghini. Just a small reminder of how different the two T’s in my life can be. Grandfather and grandson, and a grand generation gap. Thanks for stopping by! If you have a picture up for Wordless Wednesday, leave your link below! Then head on over to From Val’s Kitchen and… 
 New Clip From Ice Age Continental Drift – With #IceAge4 Giveaway 
 valmg 9 Jul 2012 | 7:40 pm One of the movies that everyone in my house enjoyed is Ice Age. We’ve seen each of the three installments and have enjoyed each. The latest installment is due out in theaters this week, on Friday July 13. I saw a preview while seeing another movie lately, plus on television as well.

 The Wiggles Are Coming To The USA This Week! And Why Wiggle Fans Shouldn’t Miss This Tour 
 valmg 8 Jul 2012 | 8:08 pm See those smiling faces right up there? Those are The Wiggles. My youngest son has been a fan of The Wiggles for many, many years. So have I actually. My son loves to dance along with the music, and has been known to replay their songs on his iPod over and over and over and over and over, well you get the picture. We’ve never seen them live, but I’ve often thought about how bonkers my son would go if given the opportunity to do so. Well, if your kids love The Wiggles like mine does and you’ve thought about taking them to the live show, now is the time to do it. And yes, I do…

 Rookie USA Has Great Sports Gear 
 Veep Veep 11 Jul 2012 | 7:02 pm I can still remember when Miss Nat got her first basketball. She took it out the box and went to learn how to play at a not so nearby park. Later that evening we went to the Jordan Brand Classic tournament at Madison Square Garden. The basketball bug bit her because a few months later she was playing on her first basketball team. I was sent some clothing for Miss Nat as a preview to the Rookie USA store opening. When Rookie USA opens it will offer a head-to-toe selection of premium kid’s footwear and apparel from Levi’s, Nike, Jordan, Converse and more. They sent some great… 
 America’s Ultimate Cheeseburger 
 Veep Veep 10 Jul 2012 | 10:15 pm Cheese is beloved around here. And I take all the credit. Why not!? Growing up, I was given the liberty to put cheese on anything—so on potatoes, vegetables, pasta and of course hamburgers, it went. Isn’t it funny how adding cheese to a meal can make your taste buds wake up from a Rip Van Winkle sleep? Now my kids have the same ability to jazz up any meal or snack with cheese. We couldn’t imagine not having cheese on one of our favorite summer time foods—cheeseburgers. Coincidentally, that’s what I had for dinner tonight. And since cheeseburgers can be…

I had to go to work, but it wasn’t so bad in the morning, however, when it was time to leave it was positively horrible out. I had quite the white knuckled drive home, especially with lots of lovely tornado warnings on the radio.

 Stepping Out 
 1 Jul 2012 | 2:14 pm I always thought I did pretty well stepping out of my comfort zone on a regular basis, taking risks, doing things I had never done before, but the truth is I was only pretending to.  My true comfort zone had not yet really been tested or stretched.  About two months ago, I prayed a prayer that is changing my life.  That prayer was simple, Lord, please provide an opportunity for me to use my gifts, while providing for my family.  I will do whatever you want me to do. You see, I’ve been working for home for a little over five years.  My reasons for working from home and doing what I…

I have finally found something that has helped me to be an even better budget maker.  I have tried this software before, but honestly didn’t understand all the concepts.  Then a few weeks ago I thought I”d give it another whirl.  So I downloaded the free 34 day trial and attended their training webinar that same evening.  This was a huge help in my understanding the software. I”ve now been using it over a couple of… 
 Thank Goodness for the Crockpot!

I started cooking meatloaf in the crockpot over a year ago, not only does it make an easy delicious meatloaf, but you don’t have to heat up your kitchen with the oven.  Then, I found this…

 Tales of the Kids 
 
 Yeah, well, you’re a big meanie 
 Marcy 11 Jul 2012 | 6:22 pm Caitlynn picks on Miles. She’s supposed to. She’s the oldest, so therefore it’s her duty to pick on her younger sibling. I got picked on by everyone it seems. It didn’t damage me too much. I only see a therapist once a day now.But Miles doesn’t like being picked on. In fact, he hates it. He’s way more sensitive than I was. Oh well. Some day he’ll get over it. At least I hope so. Until then, Miles has been looking for ways to get back at Caitlynn. He’s not clever enough yet to play jokes on her, even though Joe and I offered some ideas (plastic wrap on the toilet seat sort of…

Me neither. My other grandmother is still alive too. She’s younger – just turned 87. I hope I inherited their longevity.Unfortunately, my 95-year-old grandma doesn’t really know who anyone is. The last time I saw her, she thought I was my mother. She often called me by my mom’s name, Judy, when I was growing up but this was different. Her mind was straining to remember who I was. Marcy? Do I know a Marcy? Hmmmm…. She really looks like Judy. She must be…

But, Joe remembers. He&apos;s the good parent, I guess.I was straining to remember Caitlynn&apos;s first word while Joe and I were watching a rerun of Friends.

 Tired Mama 11 Jul 2012 | 9:33 am I saw a headline on The Huffington Post site today advertising an article that was titled, The Question you Should Never ask a Woman.&apos;I was intrigued as to what, of the many insulting questions you could ask, this might be, so I clicked on over. It turns out the question you should never ask a woman is when she is planning on starting a family. True, but it was sort of an anti-climatic question and article for someone like me, ya know? The title seemed to promise so much more.  At my age, married for almost twenty years to the same man with kids milling about, no one would even think… 
 Trying to do too much... 
 Tired Mama 6 Jul 2012 | 9:56 am I just got back from a quick trip to the city where I handed over my daughter&apos;s passport at the Swiss Embassy so they could place a travel visa in it. The consulate is only open very limited hours in the summer so I was racing through heavy Friday morning big city traffic to try to get there on time. I made it with about fifteen minutes to spare. I raced in, ran out and was thrilled that I got back to my van before the very expensive and again, very limited parking time ran out on the meter. Then, as I was driving home, I realized that I never really looked at the passport before I… 
 It&apos;s starting to feel like summer... 
 Tired Mama 3 Jul 2012 | 7:32 am Happy Summer! Happy Canada Day! Yes, I know it was yesterday. I&apos;m behind. So, what else is new? It&apos;s been a busy few weeks, we finally got up north and got the cottage sorted out. The big writing project with no deadline, but just the airy,&apos;just as soon as you can&apos;, promise is almost done. The gardens could still use some work though and the garage doors need paint. But, I&apos;m seeing the light... The kids are all home too. The oldest has a real job and is out the door for the next two months from nine to five. The younger two kids are home and aren&apos;t even driving…

 How to have a proper mommy meltdown 
 Jo Ashline, OC Moms 11 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Don&apos;t underestimate the healing nature of a good&apos;ol fashioned mommy meltdown. Photo courtesy morguefile.com First, you’ll need to get rid of the children. Find a trusted friend and/or gas station attendant. Tell them you shan’t be long. Lie. Next, you’ll need a location—preferably one far away from any other living species. You’ll also need supplies: • Speakers • iPod • Playlist that includes Tom Petty’s“Free Falling,”“Wannabe”by the Spice Girls, Sir Mix-A-Lot’s“Baby Got Back,”and pretty… 
 ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’: Christian Grey revealed by composite drawing 
 Jo Ashline, OC Moms 10 Jul 2012 | 8:30 pm Settle down ladies. This is not Christian Grey; it&apos;s a sketch of my husband Mikey (who knows his way around a pair of handcuffs, if you know what I mean). Christian Grey has been causing a ruckus among women everywhere ever since he made his debut in E.L. James’Fifty Shades of Grey. The fictional character has females swooning and drooling as they devour page after page filled with explicit and uncensored details of his sexual prowess and voracious, sadistic appetite. Thanks to Grey, millions of women are daydreaming about whips and chains and objects designed to go into places… 
 Giving advice to first-time parents is fun 
 Jo Ashline, OC Moms 10 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Awww! They&apos;re so cute. And so naive. hahahahahahahahah Photo courtesy morguefile.com I don’t know what it is about seeing a young pregnant couple out in public that makes me want to hurl unsolicited advice at them. Is it just me or do you get the same way? While out to dinner at a local Mexican restaurant last night we sat next to an adorable mom-to-be and her dashing husband and I found myself wanting to abandon my family and sit next to these two so I could grace them with my parenting pearls of wisdom, such as: Eat slowly. No seriously, slow the heck down and taste your food.

 10 Ways to Enjoy BlogHer 2012

In case you were wondering, I will, in fact, be attending BlogHer 2012 in New York City in August.  As part of a longer trip to Connecticut, I’ll drop the kids with my parents and take the Party Train into Manhattan that Thursday, just in time for the first of 3,245 parties scheduled on and off the conference site.

 HOP Review: Back It Up With Carbonite [Giveaway] 
 Kim Tracy Prince 9 Jul 2012 | 9:00 am Or, a History of My Relationship With Backing Up Data Way back in 2008, a wise woman recommended that I use Carbonite to back up my computer after I whined about losing a bunch–a very painful bunch–of photos when an external hard drive crashed.  I still remember the pangs of loss when I realized I had lost many of our  pictures from Brady’s first Christmas.  This is one of the only shots I have left: This one is so cute, can you imagine what didn’t survive? I did start using Flickr after that to back up my photos after editing them.  After another bout with…

 Healthcare reform and kids with special needs: what the new law means 
 12 Jul 2012 | 3:55 am The Affordable Care Act (ACA): Is it a good thing for kids with special needs? I really didn&apos;t have a clue how it will affect children with disabilities, and what cons there might be. Then Morris Klein, an attorney practicing in Bethesda, Maryland and the District of Columbia, kindly agreed to answer questions. He is a member of the Special Needs Alliance, a fellow of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and an elder law attorney certified by the National Elder Law Foundation. If you read this and still have q&apos;s, Mr. Klein will do his best to jump into the comments section and… 
 Seriously inspiring artwork—can you guess how it was made? 
 11 Jul 2012 | 3:47 am Take a good look at this art. What comes to mind? Perhaps that the artist has an excellent eye for detail, and is a master at shading and texture. You might wonder about the medium. I&apos;ll tell you what it is: It&apos;s a typewriter. Yep, this was all created on a manual typewriter. I&apos;ll tell you something else about the artist: He had spastic four-quad cerebral palsy. His name was Paul Smith, and I only recently discovered his story after a reader sent me an email about him; I was so fascinated, I spent the better part of a morning reading up on him and watching this video. Adults like… 
 Hating on kids with special needs: What can make it stop? 
 10 Jul 2012 | 3:43 am After 50 Cent made slurs about kids with autism on Twitter, he raised a whole lot of hackles in the special needs community. The other day, he apologized. I was glad to see it but still, the incident lingers on in my mind. What&apos;s it going to take to ease the prejudice against kids with special needs? The brouhaha began when 50 Cent tweeted at a fan, &quot;Yeah, just saw your picture fool you look autistic.&quot; He followed up with &quot;I don&apos;t want no special ed kids on my time line follow some body else.&quot;And then, attempting to make light of the situation, he added &quot;Just kidding about da special ed…

 Marinka 11 Jul 2012 | 4:47 am Young Ladrinka and I had a splendid Sunday planned last weekend, centered around the fact that we were heading to CitiField to watch our beloved Mets play. But before we headed out to the stadium, Young Ladrinka shared with me that he knows that Husbandrinka and I love our daughter more, and that he is a distant second and that usually he is ok with that state of events, but that particular morning it was hard for him to take. He had a good point, of course, because this was brought on by the fact that he and I were at a local grocery store and I, already holding 2 pounds of stewing beef and… 
 What I Learned While Reading “The Hot Zone” 
 Marinka 8 Jul 2012 | 6:52 am As you may remember, this summer my daughter and I are reading The Hot Zone, Richard Preston’s account of the Ebola epidemic. Obviously I’m reading it under duress and already have diagnosed myself with Ebola so I’m just awaiting the autopsy to confirm my findings (by the way, one of Papa’s favorite jokes is the autopsy revealed that the cause of death was the autopsy. Yes, he is available for parties, why do you ask?) But I’ve also learned a few interesting facts from the book and I’m going to share them with you here, absolutely free of charge. Ready? 1.

 Creamy Cucumber Gazpacho 
 chefdruck 10 Jul 2012 | 9:44 pm When was the last time you had an amazing dish at a restaurant, something so good you wanted to lick the plate? For me it was a few weeks ago, when I begged a few bites of the cucumber gazpacho my husband was enjoying on the back patio of Maya de Sol, a local Mexican restaurant. It was creamy, sweet, addictive, and gone way too quickly. It was too good to just wait to return to Maya, hoping the cucumber gazpacho might be on the specials menu again. I had to replicate it at home as soon as possible. I began with some shiny summer cucumbers and threw in a little avocado to punch up the… 
 Divergent: the Must Read Book of the Summer 
 chefdruck 9 Jul 2012 | 2:00 pm Were you completely addicted to the Hunger Games? Whether you fell under Suzanne Collins’spell before or after the blockbuster movie hit the theaters is irrelevant. If you loved the Hunger Games, you have to run, not walk, and buy Divergent. The first book in Veronica Roth‘s trilogy is as well written and engrossing as the Hunger Games. And if you’re not old and stubbornly clinging to the printed page like me, you don’t need to run anywhere. You can just download it immediately. However you choose to read it is not important, you just need to get your hands on the… 
 White Raspberry Sangria: The Perfect Power Failure Heatwave Antidote 
 chefdruck 5 Jul 2012 | 9:54 pm Losing power in this heat has driven us to do desperate things. First, I used my frozen breast milk to beg power from my neighbor’s generator. No man likes to dwell on that image! Then, as the temperature on the ground floor of our home reached intolerable levels, my husband went out and fought strangers for the last generator on the Home Depot truck. And when the new generator and portable AC just recirculated the hot air, I begged again. This time for a little basement space in a friend’s house with power for my sister and her kids who had just flown in for California. This heat…

 Celebrating success: girls football! 
 Susanna 9 Jul 2012 | 3:39 am This year has been a blur. From September till July the Modern Family run ourselves crazy with the school run, a dozen different clubs and after school sports, playdates, birthdays, and the occasional trip to A&amp;E. I&apos;m tired! We rarely spend the time to reflect what was achieved, and why we do it all in the first place! I&apos;m amazed our girls pack in so much. Our busiest day of the week is Saturday. All three of our girls took up football this year (you can read all about my quest to raise the profile of girls footie in the UK). So Saturday morning is spent going to football…

 My favourite time saving apps

 Smile Brilliant! {Review&amp;Giveaway} 
 Nancy 11 Jul 2012 | 5:57 am I don’t know about you, but one of my biggest insecurities is the color of my teeth.  Don’t get me wrong–they aren’t yellow or anything and I take good care of them, but they aren’t the brilliant white that you see in Hollywood, or on those really genetically blessed people.  I have always wanted to get my teeth whitened but haven’t had a) the time, b) the money, or c) the time! When the people at Smile Brilliant  contacted me about testing out their Brilliantly Simple home teeth whitening system, I was so excited!!  I was even more excited when I… 
 Mango and Smoked Turkey Salad 
 Shera 10 Jul 2012 | 2:11 pm Mango is such a distinct flavor and it’s a very“sunny”fruit. Around here mango is commonly used in smoothies and an ingredient in salsas and other dishes, and they are surprisingly easy to use in your favorite recipes. The flesh of a ripe mango is juicy and tastes like a peach with just a hint of vanilla, but the texture is totally different so not everyone loves raw mango…if texture is an issue for you, don’t write it off in your recipes though or you’ll totally be missing out! Besides delectable flavor, mangos also offer nutrition benefits. One cup of…

 Ellie Lavi 12 Jul 2012 | 4:30 am http://www.andbabymakes2.co.il My girls are almost three. I cannot quite pinpoint when, but sometime in the last few weeks, a mean elephant has taken up residence in our home.  He is generally anywhere that is not attached to me.  I have yet to see him but I hear about him quite often.  He lurks in the hallways, the room I ask them to go to without me, the stairwell if I am not holding their hand or carrying them.  In short, he is very mean and terrifying and I am the only thing that seems to give them comfort….or its simply a manipulative ploy to get me to do stuff that they are old…

The surprising thing was that I got a very good offer just a few days after I put my place up for sale. That was a good thing - BUT.I won&apos;t even attempt to relay any of the stumbling blocks I have encountered.

It&apos;s a one bedroom with a pass through kitchen just like what I have now. I like that set-up - it makes the area look larger and lets the natural light in.Another highlight is that when I look out of the windows I see a beautiful courtyard which is a short walk to one of the clubhouses. If the weather is inclement I would be able to walk through the building and get to my destination.This unit has a recessed balcony which I didn&apos;t have on my &quot;must&quot; list but…

For those of you not familiar with the online course program, each class follows pretty much the same format. The semester is nine weeks long. Each week we have reading assignments and then we have to answer a discussion question and post our response by Wednesday evening. Then by Friday we have to… 
 And Here is One Reason… 
 fixitmommy 11 Jun 2012 | 4:29 pm Why my poor blog is so neglected. No, it’s not because my little angels have not done anything exciting recently. Trust me; there is always some excitement around these parts. Rather the issue is trying to survive and clean up all the antics.….. Today I was doing so well. I got my homework done and submitted for the week. I updated the church’s website and was working on Batter Chatter, a newsletter that I do for the California Cake Club.  The girls wanted a snack, so I told them to help themselves to the snack shelf (one shelf in the pantry devoted to crap they can eat). 
 Now A First Grade Bully 
 fixitmommy 16 Mar 2012 | 8:48 am Last year, I wrote about, “Mary” our little kindergarten bully. I’ve tried to be optimistic that once she got comfortable at her new school she might mellow out and quit being so rotten (she moved to our school mid-year). Yeah, well that was a pipe dream. If anything, the child has gotten more rotten as she has gotten older.….. Yes, I feel a bit bad calling a 6 or 7-year old rotten. But there really is no other word for this child’s behavior.  I do feel sad for her because I assume the rotten-ness she projects onto my child is probably similar to the behaviors that she sees…

 Staying Organized in the Midst of Chaos. Is it Possible? 
 Mom Spark 11 Jul 2012 | 2:37 pm Two years ago, my fun on-the-side blogging hobby became a full-time career. Having the opportunity to work from home while still having my kids with me was a dream, but I didn’t realize how crazy my life would become doing so. It is a good kind of crazy, yes, but crazy nonetheless. Some days I can barely keep everything straight. I am an organized person by nature and for years have kept a paper calendar by my side to keep track of appointments, events and reminders to call loved ones. If it is not written down, it literally escapes my brain forever, which causes me to forget doctor…

In fact most of our trips are confined within the borders of California with exception of a Las Vegas road trip every now and then.

 Fish Tacos without the Taco

Since we all love fish tacos, I decided to recreate those flavors without all the carb laden tortillas.  Piling the different components on to the plate and then drizzling the dressing over everything really gave me the flavors I was craving.  I had some triggerfish in the freezer so we defrosted that and it was perfect.  This is such a great tasting versatile fish that I’m surprised it’s not more popular.  White and flaky, like many other fish–but with a very distinct…

 Roasted Stone Fruit and Arugula Bow Tie Pasta Salad 
 Christine 23 Jun 2012 | 10:31 am *Updated! We now have a giveaway for $25 worth of Hodgson Mill Products! See the rafflecopter below for details!* When I was first invited to create a salad for the Hodgson Mill Summer Pastabilities campaign, I knew I wanted to make something that was really special.  I make so many really delicious pasta salads, but I wanted to try to create something new. Summer really means the freshest fruits and vegetables and nothing says summer like a juicy peach, apricot, or plum. I decided that was the way I wanted to go, so here’s what I did for a Roasted Stone Fruit and Arugula Bow Tie Pasta…

 Tempt My Tummy…Chicken Florentine Casserole 
 Lisa 9 Jul 2012 | 4:30 pm If someone is sick, had surgery, came home with a new baby, or just having a rough time…we ladies at my church rally together and start cooking.  It is what we do to help each other.  Honestly, I am usually the ring leader as I create a meal organizer at  CareCalendar.org to help organize the meals.  As you all know, I enjoy cooking and know it is a way I can help.  One of my favorite recipes to share is Cheesy Shells and Chicken. Well, this past week the roles were reversed.   I had surgery to remove skin cancer off my face.  I also injured my shoulder limiting what I could do…

 Tempt My Tummy Tuesday…Chocolate Chip Cookies 
 Lisa 2 Jul 2012 | 5:00 pm Grace and I decide to make homemade chocolate chip cookies last week. I thought it would be fun to try a new recipe and Grace was eager to help. I gathered all the ingredients and we began to make our yummy cookie dough. Boy did that dough taste yummy! (Yes, I know we should never eat raw cookie dough.) After the dough was ready, I began scooping the dough onto my two cookie sheets. I thought it would be fun to make jumbo cookies, so I used my ice cream scoop to dip them out. Once the cookies were in the oven and the baking began…I quickly realized something was not right…. The…

 Somebody Loves Me...or Pizza 
 Connie Weiss 12 Jul 2012 | 5:29 am To say that my daughter is excited to start Kindergarten is an understatement. She was ready a year ago when her brother was getting ready to go. She couldn&apos;t understand why he could attend she wasn&apos;t old enough. This girl is so ready! The other day, the kids were working hard on something that was TOP SECRET. It ended up being a scavenger hunt for me and I had to find three pieces of paper that were hidden in different locations. For a hint, I could push a button on my children and a robotic voice would give me a clue. It took me forever to find them but it was worth… 
 I Like Mike and Ed 
 Connie Weiss 10 Jul 2012 | 5:59 am Magic Mike Call me a horny housewife.....but I loved Magic Mike. I&apos;m seeing lots of tweets and blog posts about how wrong it is to like the movie and objectifying men. If loving naked men is wrong....I don&apos;t want to be right! I did feel badly for my husband. Aunt Bobbi and I saw the film at Noon while he took the kids to Brave. Then we went and sat on a hot patio and drank a couple beers. By the time we got home I was tired and his window of opportunity had closed. Poor guy!

 Cape Cod Vacation | Fun Things To Do With Kids | Photos 
 Moomettes 11 Jul 2012 | 4:42 pm We’re back from another magnificent family vacation in Cape Cod!  I spent nine days with my daughter, charming son-in-law and the grandchildren. There’s always something fun to do with kids at The Cape, as we New England natives like to refer to that beautiful stretch of sand that extends out into the Atlantic Ocean. We’ve traditionally always take our vacation the first week of July, over the 4th of July Holiday.  Over the years, we’ve visited the Upper Cape at Falmouth, the Mid Cape, which includes Hyannis, and now usually stay on the Lower Cape.  Our favorite…

All kids like bath time, making it the perfect opportunity to having heart-to-heart conversations and finding out how their day went. I recently had the opportunity to review a beautiful new soft bath hooded towel from Bunny Slippers. Bunnyslippers.com…

 The Deposit Slip by Todd M Johnson | Book Review 
 Jendi 11 Jul 2012 | 7:21 am I found The Deposit Slip to be well written and intriguing. The main character in this story is a lawyer and the author obviously knows what it is like to be a lawyer. I knew how I hoped the story would end, but at times I was worried about it. It’s a clean, moral book; but I wouldn’t characterize it as Christian due to the lack of actual Biblical content. Plus there are many small twists and turns that I never expected. It’s definitely set up to be the first of a series. The town and other characters add a lot to the story–fun as well as interest. Yes, it’s… 
 Easy Canvas Print | Video Review 
 Jendi 10 Jul 2012 | 12:11 pm I was a bit bummed at first when I realized that I couldn’t do the customization of my own picture in the Easy Canvas Prints website. They have beautiful pictures, but I couldn’t put the quote I wanted over their available pictures. I did enjoy looking through the many beautiful pictures they offer. I would have like to be able to upload my picture and then put my quote on it using tools in their website. It took me a bit of time to find my own picture–and decide on what to do because I’m terrible at decisions. I decided on a picture and overlaid the quote using…

 Obamacare was upheld as constitutional this morning.. 
 Beckie Tetrault 28 Jun 2012 | 5:35 pm Now I am an un-apologetic supporter of Barack Obama, have been since day 1. I know he hasn&apos;t held up to all his promises, and he&apos;s made some mistakes. But in my personal opinion, he was, is and will be the best man for the job at this time in history. And today, one of the best things he has done, Health Care Reform, has been upheld by the Supreme Court as constitutional.. (pause for happy dancing) Now I am one of those who are blessed to already have really, really good health insurance. But it hasn&apos;t always been this way. I went many years with no health insurance, and was just lucky…

But it works for us, ya know? Anyways, I had to let my dog out at 9am today, which is a time of day I do not often see. I opened my backdoor to something that could only be described as Disney-ish. I kid you not, birds singing, squirrels scampering, sun filtering through the trees. I half expected Bambi to appear! And for one brief…

 Amy 7 Jul 2012 | 3:05 pm My family has loved Pinkalicious ever since she made her debut in the first Pinkalicious book, so even though I rarely host giveaways now, I couldn’t pass up the chance to share this fun with all of you.  To show you how much we love Pinkalicious, here is my former sunroom transformed for my daughter’s fifth birthday and her Pinkalicious tea party.  I went so far as to create a pink drop ceiling and even stapled pink tablecloths into the drywall.  Sometimes tape just doesn’t work quickly enough!  And of course we served Pinkalicious cupcakes…but nobody turned pink.

 Amy 6 Jul 2012 | 8:10 am When you are a little girl, you really know very little about the adults in your life.  Sure, you’ve got the basic information, the fun stories, the logistics of where and how they grew up.  But there is so much that we keep from our children.  Add to that veil of secrecy one more generation and sadly, most of us don’t really come to know and appreciate our grandparents until they are leaving us. This is how I remember my maternal grandmother…Laughing (often at something inappropriate), with family, enjoying life.  She loved to bake and made my brother and I  milk pies…

 6 Ways to Talk to Your Husband About Your Business (Without Getting Into A Fight)

All because of this business we’re pouring our hearts into so we can express our gifts and support our families, right? I’m here to reassure you.

 Why You’re Not Taking A Summer Break 
 Charlie Gilkey 27 Jun 2012 | 11:27 am A bunch of reasons just popped into your head from that headline. You don’t have the money, you don’t have the time, you don’t need to, you’re taking a sorta-break, you don’t have anyone to take care of your business while you’re out and so on. All might be true to some degree or the other, but the real truth is that you’re not taking a summer break because you haven’t given yourself permission to do so. Without the permission, there’s no commitment, and commitment is one of the necessary pieces to actually getting anything done, even when…

If that B vitamin is Biotin then the answer is a resounding yes! What is Biotin? Biotin is a water soluble B vitamin that is found naturally both in our bodies and in nature. It has other names–vitamin H or Vitamin B7 are also commonly used. It’s found naturally in a lot of the foods we eat, so an actual biotin deficiency is a rarity these days (unless you have a very, very…

 My foyer is trying to kill me 
 Maria Melee 26 Jun 2012 | 4:22 pm When you walk into our rental house, the first thing you notice is this super pimp-tacular black, shiny tile in the foyer. It’s really gorgeous and reflects the light and also shows every single however-miniscule amount of dirt or dust that could possibly be tracked or sneeezed onto it.  Since the day we first saw the house, I have never been able to return the tile to that initial sheen. The steam mop leaves tracks, sweeping doesn’t help, toweling it carefully rarely helps. It never looks right. So today I resorted to buying some Murphy’s cleaning stuff at Target on a whim…

He never comes to these things. Minnesota Mom (whispering): That’s him. It might be better if he didn’t come. He’s so old-school French that he serves stinky cheese plates and foie… 
 Le Dîner en Blanc 
 La Mom-an American Mom in Paris 15 Jun 2012 | 1:20 pm Les Moms attended the very secretive Dîner en Blanc last night. And wow, it was an evening to remember. Three words pretty much sum up the experience: magical, amazing, oh-so Parisian. (Technically, that&apos;s five words).More pictures are on La Mom&apos;s Facebook page.We&apos;re still on vacation, this is a little peek-a-boo.Bisous from the Place des Vosges,La Mom 
 Bonne Vacances 
 La Mom-an American Mom in Paris 1 Jun 2012 | 3:05 pm Mesdames et messieurs, ça y est.It’s time. Time for an exended blog-cation.Pourquoi, you may ask? Well, the past four years have been a great ride. This blog has grown up alongside our French Fries. But that’s kinda the point – we have lives. Our kids are getting older, which means homework and activities – not to mention English lessons, bien sûr! And we have jobs with some cool new career opportunities on the horizon. The blog needs to take a backseat. So voilà, nos amis. Here’s the convo about blog-cation:Stephanie: I think we’re done here. Allison: I’m so with you. But…

 Who Thinks They Can Have it All? 
 Mama Bee 21 Jun 2012 | 8:13 pm The Atlantic is nuts for women this week, but it can’t decide whether we should engage in lunatic screeds or talk seriously about women, work, and motherhood.  Either way, I sense that the magazine is in this game for the traffic, not the issues.  That’s too bad because we seem to be increasingly telling women that 1) they should aspire to having it all, and 2) they can’t have it all.  It’s enough to make a girl ask“why bother”? Take Anne-Marie Slaughter’s piece, Why Women Still Can’t Have it All.  It’s serious, but framed in a way… 
 Can We Have an Honest Conversation About Feminsim and Motherhood? 
 Mama Bee 19 Jun 2012 | 7:27 pm I’m growing increasingly concerned about the so-called“Mommy Wars”, but maybe not for the reasons you think.  It’s not because the conversation makes some mothers feel small or belittled (though it does), or even because the very existence of this debate when no such conversation happens about men smacks of sexism.  It’s because the more ridiculous and vitriolic this media-fueled frenzy becomes, the less possible it is to have an honest and conversation about women’s choices and how they affect our standing in the corporate world. This struck me sharply… 
 A Tropical Island 
 Mama Bee 2 Feb 2012 | 2:53 pm The other day a male acquaintance from my MBA program, a soon-to-be father, said that he’d had enough of working in finance in the big city.  He was rethinking his goals, looking to work like a dog over the next five to ten years so that he could move to a tropical paradise and drop out of the insanity. Of course, this resonated with me because it is the quintessential working mother’s fantasy.  Going someplace where you can live a simpler life, spend ample time with your children, not worry about office politics and getting ahead.  In fact, I suspect it’s the dream many…

I didn&apos;t take the picture, but it sure is pretty, isn&apos;t it?)We&apos;re half-way through the summer, which means we&apos;re half-way through the triathlon season. Talk about depressing! But wait - I still have a TON of events to look forward to!Starting with this weekend: I&apos;m Riding the Farm with over a hundred of my tri club girls!

He&apos;ll be done with his swing and then his jumperoo in the next month or so too.These were all shower gifts, given to us by our lovely friends and family when I was pregnant with Ms. Foo. Three tiny little babies have used them. And three tiny little babies have outgrown them.Putting them away, and clearing out the floor space in our living room has always felt so cleansing. We get our living room back! (Minus the big kid toys piled onto our bookshelves where books used to…

 Two Dinner Party Ideas – a Mediterranean Menu and a Lobster Fest – and a Dessert Recipe for Watermelon Sorbet Pie 
 Janice 9 Jul 2012 | 7:04 am If you’re hoping to host a fabulous, impress-your-guests dinner party this summer, I have a few ideas that you’re more than welcome to borrow: The first is a dinner party with a Mediterranean-style theme…and the second is a New England inspired lobster fest. And when it’s time for dessert, feel free to serve this refreshing Watermelon Sorbet Pie, adapted from Taste of Home magazine. When it’s sizzling hot outside, a fruit-based dessert like this one hits the spot. Read on for the recipe as well as some behind-the-scenes pics of two dinner parties I attended… 
 A Recipe for Cauliflower Casserole and a Sneak Peak at “French Kids Eat Everything” by Karen Le Billon 
 The Meal Makeover Moms 6 Jul 2012 | 9:16 am We spend a lot of time chatting with fellow moms about strategies for getting their picky eaters to try new foods and to become more adventurous at the dinner table. Now, to the rescue with her own set of strategies is Karen Le Billon, author of the new book, French Kids Eat Everything. Karen will be a guest on our Cooking with the Moms radio podcast in a few weeks, but we in the meantime, we couldn’t resist sharing a few tips from the book and Karen’s simple recipe for Cauliflower Casserole (or as they say in France, Gratin de Chou-Fleur). We don’t know about you, but… 
 Bisquick’s Impossibly Easy Vegetable Pie Gets a Healthy Makeover

After all, we’re The Meal Makeover Moms, and this is what we do! So when Kristin B., a longtime fan and mom of two from San Jose, CA asked us to take the classic Betty Crocker Bisquick recipe for Impossibly Easy Vegetable Pie and make it over, we hit the kitchen running. The recipe Kristin sent us calls for whole milk, full-fat cheese, and half a cup of Bisquick. Bisquick Original is made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, so Kristin requested…

 SNAP&amp;the Farm Bill (GOES TO CONGRESS TOMORROW!) 
 Cecily Kellogg 10 Jul 2012 | 12:06 pm Did that headline get your attention? I hope so. Yes, it’s a bit overly dramatic. Congress also wants to do things like balance the budget and cut spending and other stuff that helps them keep their jobs. But sometimes the cost of that comes down to something as dramatic, and simple, as children going hungry. The laws that authorize the SNAP program – commonly known as Food Stamps, actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program…read the rest at the Uppercase Lowdown.

 Breaking My Self-Imposed Silence 
 Cecily Kellogg 9 Jul 2012 | 8:20 am It’s taken me a while, but I finally figured out why I haven’t been posting here. It’s because there is something so huge, something dominating my life so much, that NOT writing about it has been like a stone in my mouth, unable to share this core truth of my life in this place – my blog, the place where I share what’s bothering me, what’s making me happy, and what’s making me crazy. And right now, something is making me crazy. It’s this: living with my mom is really, really, REALLY hard. Before I say too much, know that my mom reads here (not all… 
 SCOTUS and the Affordable Care Act 
 Cecily Kellogg 3 Jul 2012 | 6:24 am I lost my health insurance in November of 2010. We tried, my husband and I, to maintain our monthly payments ($1,100 for the whole family, including our daughter) in the face of near economic ruin thanks to the economy and the two-freelancers-as-couple lifestyle. But when we received a notice that the payment would be increasing to nearly $1,700 a month? We just couldn’t do it. Please read the rest at my new column at Babble Voices.

 HULLABALOO: Raise a Ruckus (New Kids CD) 
 Felicia Carter 11 Jul 2012 | 9:04 pm We are very particular about what children&apos;s music we will listen to over here. If you are a parent then you know what I mean. Sometimes there are CDs that you just can&apos;t take. You really just can&apos;t. They must be turned off, taken out and thrown away. That&apos;s all you can do. Prime example, my friend Christy who couldn&apos;t decide which was more annoying, her child screaming in the car or the &quot;polly-wolly doodle all the day&quot; song playing over and over in the background. Hmm. Tough call on that one. So, when I was introduced to HULLABALOO I was so excited…

 Traveling With Skype 
 admin - Jennifer 11 Jul 2012 | 5:47 am Traveling with Skype is now easier than ever! When you go on vacations you can use Skype to keep in touch with your loved ones back home. Even better, using Skype while on the road is the perfect way to let your loved ones know that you are okay and making progress on your trip. Recently, we traveled across country on our big move back home and I used Skype with my son to chat about what state we were going through, how we were all doing and share our estimated time of arrival. It was great seeing him along the way and actually sharing the experiences he was missing. Skype is such an…

 Nothing is worth more than this day 
 12 Jul 2012 | 4:50 am &quot;Nothing is worth more than this day.&quot; - Goethe Emily posted this quote on Facebook, and if I hadn&apos;t already ruled out the possibility of divine revelation through Facebook, I&apos;d have read it like a message from God. I used to associate &quot;living in the moment&quot; with a brand of hedonistic irresponsibility. I mean, all you have to do is change one little preposition (living for the moment), and you sound more like Pitbull than Goethe, ascribing to that foolish mantra of &quot;eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die&quot;. I&apos;ve flown a responsible holding pattern for most of my life.

 Slivered Yellow Moon (Just Write) 
 25 Jun 2012 | 6:43 pm Tonight I saw a slivered yellow moon against a black sky. I wanted to stare at it for hours, and I might have if it weren&apos;t for the groceries in the back of the car and the constant compulsion to conform to social norms, one of which being that a late-30s mom isn&apos;t allowed to gawk at the moon for hours on end. It&apos;s just that this was the same slivered yellow moon I watched rise half my life ago over a small lake in the Sierras. It was the last week of camp, and we staffers had just come from a party celebrating the end of the season. None of us seemed ready to say this was the end, so we… 
 Melt Down 
 22 Jun 2012 | 5:17 am I&apos;ve discovered a not-so-magical power this summer. If ever I want to wake up the children without saying a word, without coming within fifty feet of their rooms, all I need to do is open Blogger and start typing. Works every time. This past week, my computer had a stroke and appears to be one blue screen and reboot away from its final death. Then the fridge started feeling under appreciated and decided to teach me a lesson in gratitude by taking a break from the cold-air-production part of its job. The timing was perfect, especially since I&apos;d just returned from the grocery store. It also…

 Connection In a Box. Is This BabbaBox Yours!? 
 Zen Mommy 18 Jun 2012 | 8:50 pm Last week I received connection in a box. It came on a day life found me far too busy to slow down and be connected and yet there I was, home on a rainy day with four kids pulling for me to be just that.

 Summer FUN Takes Getting Organized 
 Zen Mommy 11 Jun 2012 | 4:22 am We’re in full on summer mode now in the Tucker household but this took some doing. School ending doesn’t automatically get us into summer mode. I don’t know about your household, but for us, there is a period of a couple weeks where we all“shift”. It seems we all need a week to just decompress, and then one to get more organized into our new routine. After a few days of chilling, my kids are that much more excited to start“planning”our summer together. For me, a mom that does NOT come by organization easily, summer planning is important. Here are… 
 Hey, Connection Isn’t Always Easy 
 Zen Mommy 22 May 2012 | 12:23 pm re·la·tion·ship [ri-ley-shuhn-ship] noun 1. a connection, association, or involvement. 2. connection between persons by blood or marriage. 3. an emotional or other connection between people. 4. a sexual involvement; affair. Being a mother, wife, lover, woman, friend…sometimes it’s hard. Maybe it’s just that by definition relationships are hard. Look above. The word connection is used in three of the four explanations of relationship and hey, connection isn’t always easy.

 Happy 4th 
 admin 4 Jul 2012 | 6:32 am I don’t remember ever liking fireworks. I mean, they’re pretty…sort of. But really? They’ve always slightly bored me. The whole looking up, ooohhing and ahhhing and having to cover my ears thing just never really did it for me. I know, I’m un-American, right. I mean, who DOESN’T like fireworks besides me and my dog, who freaks out from the noise? Oh, and most babies. Babies don’t like fireworks either. And, to be quite honest, I can’t blame them. What I DO love, though, is having my friends and family over to celebrate. Actually, I just love… 
 BlogHer, Private Parties and Such: Some Thoughts and Advice 
 admin 3 Jul 2012 | 6:55 am Every year, around this time…or earlier, the BlogHer party hoopla begins. The first time I went was 2009, I was one of those involved in the private party invite search. I couldn’t stand it though. The hurt feelings. The begging. The ass-kissing. So in 2010, along with Lauren and Melysa, I founded BarHer. The ultimate ANTI-private party. A party that no one would have to beg for an invite to. We opened it with around 80 invites, leaving over 100 people on the wait list. But, because it was an anti-private party, we opened it to everyone. Screw the wait list. This year, BarHer is…

I’ve actually been writing there. More than one post. The address is Groundhog Day Memoirs. Stop in and visit won’t you? I’ll still be here sometimes, I’m sure.

 Alpha dads raise alpha sons — it’s primal 
 anika palm 11 Jul 2012 | 6:05 am You know that stereotype about how nothing pleases the dad who was the captain of the high-school football team more than seeing his son become the captain of the high-school football team? It turns out that the stereotype may have some basis in truth—ancient, evolutionary truth. UCLA primatologist Susan Perry, who does research with white-faced capuchin monkeys, has determined that the offspring of alpha males enjoy and pass on major advantages over the sons of more subordinate monkeys. The research may provide hints into how our ancestors created power hierarchies and then passed… 
 Guest blogger: Kids, parents have different concerns about driving 
 Lisa Cianci 10 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am The thought of my stepdaughter getting a drivers license terrifies me. Not because she’s an irresponsible person,  but because I’ve been out there … in traffic.  I see driver’s distractions firsthand and I’m convinced that you not only have to worry about your own driving, but you also have to be skilled enough to anticipate the way others will drive. But my stepdaughter has bigger concerns, such as what type of car she will  drive. Not too long ago, as we were discussing  how to acquire her license, I proudly offered to let her drive my Jeep Liberty after she passes her test. 
 Does spanking lead to mental illness? 
 Lisa Cianci 3 Jul 2012 | 12:20 pm An alarming new study is out says that spanking kids can lead to mental disorders once they become adults. Read here for the details. The study goes on to note that physical punishment can lead to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and alcohol or drug abuse. This is scary stuff. The study, published in the respected journal Pediatrics, will no doubt prompt more debate over to spank or not to spank. I don’t need a study to tell me spanking is wrong. I’ve never spanked my 15-year-old son. I don’t think it’s necessary; there are other forms of discipline that are…

 What motivates you? 
 LauraKim 10 Jul 2012 | 11:00 pm This has been a hot topic in our house for a few weeks now as both David and I try to establish what motivates us. I think he has a better understanding of what motivates him than I do. I am throwing it out there for your thoughts. What motivates you? If you can, try not just say“my kids”–kids motivate by default. I am looking for more than that. The reason you get up each morning! Is it money? Fame? Success? Ambition? Creativity? After spending much time thinking about it I think I have an idea what motivates me but I want to hear first what motivates you?“I want…

I&apos;m finished.&quot; I wanted to scold, to tell her she should eat more, that her doctor and my mother and her friends said she should eat more, but I held my tongue. Some things just aren&apos;t worth fighting with your great-aunt about. Besides, she would eat, sooner or later. She was just in a snit (although she&apos;d never admit to it) about Uncle Ford… 
 small town, big lights 
 Jess 24 Jun 2012 | 9:13 am Right now I&apos;m sitting on a car hood, watching a drive in movie. This in itself isn&apos;t spectacular (although with the scarcity of drive-ins, it kinda is) but I&apos;m sitting on a car hood, watching The Lorax at the drive in movie at the school. My childrens&apos; school is so conscious of the families nearby and what would draw us all together, that they began showing drive-in movies in the heart of our community - the school. (Literally - the screen is up on the building!) There are no stars tonight - it&apos;s actually spitting a little, but for the families sitting in their cars and… 
 juris doctor 
 Jess 21 Jun 2012 | 8:12 pm The candles were guttering out in the pale light when I found him, head down on the table, an empty bottle clutched in his hand. There was a wrapper stuck to his cheek, pizza boxes thrown on the floor, and his buddy Travis was raising the roof with his snores on the half-broken daybed in the corner. It must have been a great night. Not that I blamed him for cutting loose. It had been a long winter, and an even more tedious spring, tests and exams and study study study, punctuated every once in awhile with pop quizzes and fits of bleak black depression where he insisted that he&apos;d never make to…

 She {hearts} Atoning Yoga 
 Elisabeth 5 Jul 2012 | 4:30 am Since 2003, when I was first introduced to the practice of yoga,  I’ve felt a closeness to God while on my mat. The stillness, the quiet allowed me to focus on God’s presence and never have I feel it more strongly.  That was one of the reasons I was so drawn to Yoga, and the best times on the mat were either alone or in a class with an instructor who didn’t speak Sanskrit or read mantras. Often times though, I had to block out what the instructor might be saying, since it usually didn’t align with my Christan faith.  I was on a mission for awhile, to find… 
 NCAA Football 13 Coming July 10th! 
 Sheena 4 Jul 2012 | 4:43 pm Playing video games is one of our favorite past times especially on cold and rainy days. We do, however, game year’round and regularly find ourselves picking up a new game here and there to enjoy. My favorite games are usually adventure, action, platform, and rhythm. Greg’s favorites are shooters, action-adventure, and horror. Jayden loves platform, fitness, and rhythm. While our favorite games don’t include sports games (well, do the Wii Sports games count?) we are excited for the new release of NCAA Football 13 launching at Walmart July 10th. We are always open to trying…

 26 Jun 2012 | 11:22 am Dear Daughter, Today is your first day of camp. Hopefully you are settling in okay. Introduce yourself to the other girls in your tent/cabin/bunker. Get to know your counselors/instructors. Know what to do after dark when the lights go out. As you probably have realized by now, Daddy and I did not send you to Girl Scout camp as we told you. Instead, you will be spending the next six days at Zombie Apocalypse Training Camp. Surprise! We thought it was important that one member of our family be fully trained in what to do if/when the Zombie Apocalypse takes place. Since Daddy and I have to… 
 Villanelle For A Lost Crock Pot Lid 
 1 Jun 2012 | 2:07 pm I hope this pork roast doesn&apos;t kill a kid. It&apos;s soaked in vinegar, will that be okay? I couldn&apos;t find the god damn crock pot lid;someone washed the dishes, now it&apos;s hid - not here, vamoosed, it&apos;s absent, gone astray. I hope this pork roast doesn&apos;t kill a kid.I&apos;ve organized the shelves but GOD FORBID the pots and pans are rightly put away: I couldn&apos;t find the god damn crock pot lid.And so I called my mom, that&apos;s what I did: &quot;My crock pot&apos;s trash. This isn&apos;t a good day. I hope this pork roast doesn&apos;t kill a kid.&quot;My mom insisted all was quo pro quid: &quot;Just top with foil, the roast… 
 Where&apos;s Josette? School Madness, Twittering, and Mamapop 
 27 May 2012 | 1:05 pm Yeah, so, I was doing real good with posting once a week. That was fabulous, how good I was doing with that. But then I wasn&apos;t. Because April/May is hell. I mean, the good kind of hell. A brief synopsis of April/May would include two weekend skating competitions that required lots of driving, hotels, and hand-holding a highly-combustible teen girl athlete, three orchestra concerts, a Girl Scout bridging ceremony, three field trips (one which included a 2 1/2 mile hike up the sheer face of a mountain), three class parties, three track and field days, a skating recital, a soccer tournament, and…

 DIY Olympic Gold Medals 
 Cindy Hopper 11 Jul 2012 | 9:11 pm Make your own homemade gold medals to celebrate the upcoming Olympics and your own special gold medalists! I love Pluffy from Sculpey. It is nice soft workable clay that doesn’t harden until you bake it.  Another fabulous product is metallic paint from DecoArt. It really makes your objects look like metal. So grab some Pluffy (one package will make about three medals), Metallics Paint, a brush and ribbon and you are ready to get started.We used found objects to cut and press into the clay. A drinking glass made the perfect circle.The cap to a lip balm made perfect rings and a skewer… 
 Gold Star Chart: iCarly Contest Promotes Creative Kids’ Vegetable Recipes 
 Isabel 10 Jul 2012 | 1:15 pm I have been involved in the online parenting space enough years to be following along (and writing about) the developments in food marketing to children. Back in 2007 (yes, five years ago!) I wrote about companies, like General Mills, limiting the use of licensed characters to healthier food options for kids. Nickelodeon followed suit by only allowing its licensed characters (like Dora and SpongeBob) to be used on healthier food as well, also in 2007. These were moves that I applauded, citing that parents have enough shin kicking to contend with on a daily basis and could use a reprieve when… 
 The Seven-Month Itch 
 Amalah 9 Jul 2012 | 8:29 am Dear Amy,In the grand scheme of things, I have no problems. My 7-month-old girl child is the most perfect, beautiful, genius creature to ever inhabit the planet. So if this is all I have to complain about, I’m really okay.The girl is all clawing hands, all the time. Digging nails into my boob while eating, pinching my arm fat with the other hand. Tearing her ears up with teething pain. And Lord help her delicate girly parts when the diaper comes off. My husband worries that she could have an infection she’s scratching at but, since she’s equal-opportunity grabtastic,…

 Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Tour and Coupon code 
 6 Jul 2012 | 10:33 am This past weekend we packed up 4 kids and the camera then we went to one of the monoliths in Denver, Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The tallest sports field in the US, sitting over a mile high at its highest peak. There were people from all over the US there to take the tour. When we first got there my little ones (and my teens) went off to the play area full of jerseys, skis, and helmets for them to try on. They loved it. If you don’t know how much weight a Bronco football player wears on his shoulders, try on the pads, a helmet and a jersey. It’s amazing how heavy those items are… 
 Skyhawks Sports Camps 
 5 Jul 2012 | 4:37 pm We are a sports family like many of my friends. There are tons of things for kids to do with their time and for our&apos;s it seems they are going to be spending it doing something active.So when I heard about a sports camp for young kids, I was thrilled with the idea. A week long camp, 4-8 hours a day (depending on age) to teach them the fundamentals and beyond. I can&apos;t lose right?The difficult choice.... cheerleading camp OR golf camp for my 5 year old little girl.Easy right?Yep... she&apos;ll be going to golf camp at the end of July for her first time! I hope she is as excited as I am!Skyhawks has…

 The Photo Gallery: Food 
 11 Jul 2012 | 12:00 am I was having a conversation with a friend recently about what is the best &apos;weird&apos; sandwich. Obviously it&apos;s mashed banana and crisps, but then we got onto really weird sandwiches and snacks. Like my nephew used to have red onion and jam sandwiches when he was younger. And a friend of mine&apos;s son would snack on raw turnips; he&apos;d carefully scrub one under the tap then dry off with a paper towel and MUNCH. And it got me on to how when I was a child, my brother and I would rush in from playing outside and make ourselves a sandwich each; mine a brown sauce sandwich, his a ketchup sandwich. No… 
 Future star 
 10 Jul 2012 | 3:10 am I&apos;m so bloody proud of this girl. Sure we&apos;re going through tough times at the moment, but we also have sunshine. Lots and lots of sunshine. She&apos;s learning to ride a horse at the moment and is punching way about her grade. She looks like a 9 year old sat up there on Suzie the pony. Straight back, heels down; mum on the sidelines taking endless photographs . . . This is her comfort zone and for an animal mad young lady, this is heaven. 
 Let down by the school system 
 8 Jul 2012 | 2:00 pm Our family has become a statistic. An unpleasant statistic. My 9 year old has been refused a place at the middle school he wants to go to. We&apos;ve appealed and done everything in our power as parents to meet his wishes, but it is not to be. The LEA don&apos;t care about him or his circumstances or our family&apos;s circumstances.They don&apos;t care that I gave up a career so I could take my kids to school every day.Or that I&apos;ve now got to rely on someone to help me get both my children to school because I can&apos;t physically do it myself - unless I happen upon a time machine between now and the start of… 

 
 Ask Moxie 
 
 Some news, with the lede not buried 
 Moxie 12 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am I&apos;m writing a book.A few weeks ago I announced on my Facebook page that I had written a book proposal for an Ask Moxie book and was looking for an agent. A bunch of people helped me by sending me recommendations, and I got a lot of feedback from those agents. It all seemed to consist of the message that my book looked interesting and unique and they wanted to read it, but wouldn&apos;t be able to sell it. I was perplexed, until one very kind agent explained to me that she loved the book but no publisher would be able to buy it, because it didn&apos;t make financial sense for them to buy… 
 50 Shades of Commodification 
 Moxie 10 Jul 2012 | 6:43 am Everyone&apos;s talking about how the book 50 Shades of Grey and the movie Magic Mike are&quot;mom porn.&quot;I disagree. I think they&apos;re commodification of moms. When I first heard about 50 Shades of Grey I was kind of baffled about why it was such a big deal, because so many of the women I know either read sex-filled books or watch porn. It might not be BDSM-themed, like 50SoG is, but whether it&apos;s the kind of book that euphemizes body parts or the kind that describes every detail in detail, we&apos;ve been reading them for years. And whether it&apos;s just a racy movie or… 
 Q&amp;A;: Baby being spooked into crying while asleep 
 Moxie 9 Jul 2012 | 5:12 am A friend with an almost-4-month-old asks:&quot;Have you heard of babies spooking easily, especially when they&apos;re asleep? The baby breaks out into crying in middle of (light) sleep, like she had a bad dream.&quot;This seems early for night terrors, and there&apos;s no indication that she can&apos;t get back to sleep. I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s teething, actually. Both of my kids seemed to have these random jolts of pain that would jerk them into crying briefly but then pass so they settled again, whther asleep or awake. If the baby has any of the following symptoms of teething that…

I want to continue our studies a few days a week into the summer. Any more than that and I think there may be a mutiny! I don’t want the kids to miss the beautiful summer by being cooped up inside either though. So why not incorporate some of our learning into outdoor fun!

 maui fun: ziplining! 
 Sarah 27 Jun 2012 | 2:55 am I did it!  I flew at 6,000 feet above ground without a helicopter, an airplane or a parachute. And I loved it! A group of Maui social media lovers and myself were invited to fly like a bird at Piiholo Ranch. Located on the side of gorgeous Haleakala, we got suited up, hooked on to [...]

 Tell Congress To Protect SNAP Funding in the Farm Bill Now 
 Connie 10 Jul 2012 | 5:10 pm If you care about children, you care about SNAP and the Farm Bill. And it takes just a few minutes to send a message to Congress not to cut the budgets of these programs that ensure children don’t go hungry. Every message counts! Members of Congress are working to reauthorize the Farm Bill, legislation that provides funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, formerly known as food stamps, and for the SNAP education program. Did you know that nearly half of all SNAP participants are children? Please don’t judge people who receive help from SNAP. It can happen…

I have been a fan of Boar’s Head since I was a child. It’s the only lunch meat or cold cuts that I ate. Even to this day, it is a staple in my home. Sandwiches, platters of antipasto and rolled up cold cuts and cheese are my favorite ways to enjoy the taste of Boars Head. When a new flavor comes out, I try my best to buy it as quickly as possible. Boar’s Head is made with the best ingredients. There are… 
 Clothes Shopping for Tweens 
 Connie 9 Jul 2012 | 7:12 pm Before we left for our family vacation I knew I had to do some clothes shopping for my tween daughter. The daughter who would rather take an Algebra final than walk inside a store with me. When I looked at the clothes she was preparing to pack, the lack of shorts, tops and a swim suit that fit her was obvious. After begging and pleading with her to go shopping with me so she could try on the much needed new attire I gave in and went out on my own. I had my online coupon codes printed out and in hand along with my smart phone. My plan was to take photos of clothing and text them to her before… 
 How to Prepare Your Tween To Travel Alone

Whether flying solo or traveling with a group, knowing how to prepare your tween will make their trip go well. Learn the rules of flying as an unaccompanied minor, what safety issues to cover, what to pack and how to prevent home sickness. My tween traveled to Kansas to visit her sister and brother-in-law this summer. Although she took a road trip with them, this is her first time traveling without me and her father. She is an anxious child and likes to maintain a routine, has health problems and is…

 Ice Cream: The Pinnacle of Food Preservation 
 Amber 12 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am I am far from a strict locavore, but I do a lot of local eating, especially at this time of year. In fact, doing more local eating is my One Green Thing for July. In my quest to reduce my food miles I grow a garden, I belong to a local CSA program, I shop at my farmers’market and I eat seasonally. I also preserve the harvest when it comes in. Each year I freeze, can and dry food to eat all year long. While I enjoy all of the foods that I preserve, there’s one item that trumps them all, and that’s ice cream. In my mind homemade ice cream using local milk, cream and fruit is… 
 The Parenting Expert has Left the Building 
 Amber 11 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am I’ve been working at this parenting gig for almost seven and a half years now. In that time I’ve dealt with my share of parenting issues. From having a premature baby in the NICU to navigating the return to work to cleaning poop off the kitchen counter to choosing a school to taking that first overnight trip away, I’ve logged a lot of miles. Along the way I’ve learned a lot, picking up tips and tricks that mostly worked, some of the time, until they didn’t. I’ve become a lay expert in infant development, child psychology and making peanut butter sandwiches. 
 (Not) Watching the News 
 Amber 10 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am Before I had children, I watched a lot of news. I also watched newsmagazines, talk shows, and true crime shows. On the one hand, I just watched more television in general. I had a lot more free time, after all. On the other hand, I was interested in what was happening, and I wanted to be informed. All of that changed when I became a parent, though. Not because I didn’t want to know what was happening in the world anymore, but because I couldn’t stand it when what I heard was bad. And, if you’ve ever watched the news, you know that much of what you hear is bad. Having… 
 Scenes From a Summer Weekend 
 Amber 9 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am While the rest of the continent was experiencing an oppressive heat wave, Vancouver remained cool and rainy all throughout June and into early July. Finally, though, summer has arrived. My children are soaking up every minute. I think summer was made for kids, with its spray parks and wading pools and no school to get in the way. I loved summer when I was a child. The long evenings are perfect for spending at the park, or taking a walk through your neighbourhood. Or maybe, if you’re really lucky, your parents will round everyone up to go out for ice cream after dinner. (I make my own…

In 2010, Strocel.com was selected as one of Vancouver Mom’s 30 Ultimate Vancouver Mom Blogs, which was immensely flattering. Vancouver Mom threw a party to celebrate, but I wasn’t able to make it because Jacob was still at the stage where he refused to fall asleep without me. But once you’re named you’re invited to the party every year, so in…

 Tart up your filofax with a side order of enabling 
 Tracy Reinhardt 11 Jul 2012 | 5:35 am So many people ask where I get the things that I use to decorate my Filofax. It&apos;s really a matter of finding things randomly, I don&apos;t get everything from one seller. Most of the things I&apos;ve gotten are available through different sellers and there is some overlap. Also things might be sold out someplace but available at other shops, so looking around is helpful. Pricing (and shipping varies) a lot so it pays to find what you want and then search for it in other places. I search broadly first and then narrow it down; for example I&apos;ll search stickers, then make a second… 
 The Jolly Green Filofax Video 
 Tracy Reinhardt 10 Jul 2012 | 7:24 am This is my newest Filofax, an Emerald A5 Finsbury. I bought it used on eBay and as far as I know this color is not available directly from Filofax anymore. I did a blog post on this planner here. Only two more days to enter the Success Choice Planner Giveaway (here ) 
 Filofax with some Ho! Ho! Ho! 
 Tracy Reinhardt 6 Jul 2012 | 6:25 am Earlier this week I received an A5 Finsbury that sure looked aqua in the listing. Turned out more the color of The Jolly Green Giant. He sells peas and says, Ho! Ho! Ho! See? Not that I mind the color, I&apos;m a glass half-full sort of person and green is my favorite color. And it looks perfect with my wallet. The combination is so Preppie-80&apos;s I want to pop the collar on my polo shirt. The rings are the same as my big boy so I set it up. Just took everything that was in the A5 Malden and deposited in my new elf-like planner. The front has a mesh… 
 Cheesy save! 
 Tracy Reinhardt 5 Jul 2012 | 11:10 am I just recycled a cheap $4 wall clock into something Aqualicious! It&apos;s big, over a foot wide and had the most hideously designed face; a cheesy mess of country-themed awful. Now, I love it so and it goes with my walls. Most things from this century don&apos;t. 
 Decluttering my Filofaxes 
 Tracy Reinhardt 5 Jul 2012 | 7:20 am I&apos;ve decided to sell the Filofaxes I&apos;m not using. I found them at a store that was no longer going to carry them and couldn&apos;t help myself.  The Filofaxes had been there for years, any dated material was at least 2 years old; some more like 5 or six years back. I&apos;m just selling the binders without inserts since any of them are too old to use and it will be cheaper to ship.  Some had no boxes and some had the wrong ones so I&apos;m going to mail the binders without a box. These are all new but I&apos;ve been burned a lot of eBay with the word &apos;new&apos;.

 The 15 year reunion…in advance 
 Jillian 12 Jul 2012 | 3:53 am So, people in my class (some who can see this. Hi, y’all) are planning our 15 year reunion. A couple of things occur to me while this is happening. #1- all of us are frantically trying to figure out how much lipo, botox, hair color and new wardrobes run and if we can pull it together by October. #2- Honestly, I don’t remember half of these people and it’s not because I was stuck up then or now, it’s because I’m old and sometimes forget words like“filing cabinet”(you know, that THING, that THING in the corner that holds…the files!). #3-… 
 Dogs only speak Spanish and other lies 
 Jillian 11 Jul 2012 | 12:11 am People frequently wonder where AJ gets his offbeat, quirky personality. I consider it for a while and then I respond with,“lots of love, some genetics and we lied to him. Alot.”All of this is true. We told ourselves we were going to be good parents that never lied to our child about anything. Fantasy creatures that leave gifts on holidays? They just never came up. Some years AJ believed and some he didn’t. It was all alright. However, sometimes, AJ, in his toddler frustration, would get worked up about things that were so far outside of our control that it became a parent… 
 A difference of perspective: How we view our military 
 Jillian 7 Jul 2012 | 5:31 pm Last night, I was at the dinner theater at Chaffin’s Barn here in Nashville, TN. I’d never gone before, though I’d heard many things about it, all good. One of the nice things they do is a pre-show introduction that includes asking the members of our current and past military to stand and be acknowledged. What I observed was that a few more recent members stood immediately. However, the older members of the military, some very clearly out of the military for many years, were very reluctant to be acknowledged. Eventually, the number went from two standing to around ten, many… 
 Love Expands 
 Jillian 4 Jul 2012 | 2:29 am Over the weekend, my sister-in-law got married. This was actually a very big deal for many reasons in my family, but for AJ and myself, it was a big deal because we would be meeting one of my sisters-in-law and her family for the first time in the time I’ve been married, as well as my new brother-in-law and his entire family. We’d also not been on a trip or done much in the time I’d been in school and to go see family is one of the best reasons to take a trip. I was looking forward to seeing my niece and nephews very, very much. I can tell you the exact moment I knew that I… 
 Book Review: The Healing: A Novel by Jonathan Odell 
 Jillian 4 Jul 2012 | 1:26 am The Healing by Jonathan Odell has been compared to the monster hit“The Help”in that they are both stories about women treated as Slaves in the South. While I liked“The Help,”I was actually really glad the stories read very differently to me. Where“The Help”felt light in many ways to me,“The Healing”was a complex, vivid portrayal of how multi-generational the effects of slavery were in the United States as well as how interconnected the lives of people are in many ways. Granada is a slave born on a plantation that seems plagued by bad…

 An Old Seventh Generation Ad I Did 
 Susan 2 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am A snapshot taken from the previous Seventh Generation website. I’ve done my share of ad campaigns including both print and commercials, but this one (w/Seventh Generation) is by far the most special.  I believe in their products and their mission.  I use to go to their website all the time just to look at my daughter at that special age (she was only 9 months old).  Time flies and she is already 6 (plus, who would have predicted I would have another baby, now 2 years old).

 Calli 9 Jul 2012 | 9:11 am I was behind on my Bee’s Knees Bee Block, and I’d like to blame it on Summer. But actually I think I was a little intimidated by June’s bee block.  Excited to try it, but intimidated. Erika, from Pink Suede Shoe, sent out a fun, bright bundle of fabric- all turquoise, pink and yellow.  The [...]

 Foxes, Dirty Food, and Brasserie Central

 Making No Corrections 
 GrumbleGirl 26 Jun 2012 | 12:38 pm Oh, this little girl…She says,“Mummy, can I have one of these africots?”And“Is this adocado ripe now?”And“It’s so hot outside…I need some sunscream.”She is nearly four-and-a-half. I’m not in a rush to correct these little words of hers…she’s become long and lean, and nimble. And wise. It’s the last of the baby in her. *sniff* 
 Vibrations 
 GrumbleGirl 13 Jun 2012 | 6:04 am I’m still vibrating from this house party I went to over a week ago…it was to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of some very cool people we know. TWENTY years. It feels like an almost impossible amount of time, but then, Martin and I have been together for nearly that long too. Sometimes it feels like but a blip of time. Sometimes time passes as slowly as non-flowing molasses. These friends of ours have also been renovating their house for the past eighteen months, so in some ways, it was like a“big reveal”night, for anyone who hadn’t been inside their house…

 My Father-in-Law May Now Know Exactly What He&apos;s Gotten Himself In To 
 9 Jul 2012 | 3:59 pm A few months ago when NJ was getting ready to go back on the road for work, he started giving me instructions for how to handle the yard. Among those instructions was what to do in the event I found a baby squirrel on the ground and a warning about mama squirrels attacking. Yesterday, all three of us were in the kitchen and, as NJ gazed out the window, he made a comment about me not putting any corn on this little squirrel feeder: Grace said when the little squirrels sit in the chair eating theircorn, it makes them look like they have a huge yellow penis. Although… 
 Rolling With the Sandwich Generation 
 8 Jul 2012 | 2:08 pm Webster&apos;s Dictionary defines the Sandwich Generation as, &quot;a generation of people who are caring for their aging parents while supporting their own children.&quot; Or, if you&apos;re me, your aging father-in-law. Yep, that&apos;s right, as of 4:00 PM Friday I became an official member of the Sandwich Generation. For the next four to six months, I am in charge of the medical care and death with dignity of this guy: He seems to be comfortable being left with me despite the fact he barely knows me and that I may or may not have told him he shouldn&apos;t even freak out about having surgery on his liver because it… 
 What Would You Think if You Woke Up to Someone Putting a Pillow Over Your Head?

Basically, the men are going fishing, the children are going to entertain each other and Michelle and I are going to live a utopian existence for the next four days. It will be good for everyone. In order for NJ to make it home for out little family vacation, he had to work from 9:00 PM until 4:00 AM and then drive nine hours to get home. He was very sleepy, which led to him crashing within an hour of arriving home, getting up long enough to eat supper and then crashing back out. Until 4:30 AM. When he threw a…

 Helping Friend Contact a Bankruptcy Lawyer 
 admin 12 Jul 2012 | 6:57 am When my best friend phoned me this afternoon, I could tell that she was not her normal, happy self. Her voice was quiet, and she sounded emotionally drained. She confided in me that she could no longer pay her bills. She was being harassed by creditors every waking second of the day. I know how this feels because I was once in her shoes. I immediately found the office number for the same San Jose CA Bankruptcy Lawyer that I used and gave it to her.

Thanks to a virtual pbx service, you will have the flexibility of choosing any phone number of any area code regardless of where your actual business is located at. This is an appealing idea for your business, you should consider using this type of phone service.

 The Fearless Child and The Careful Child: Our Twins 
 Stephanie Manner Wagner 3 Jul 2012 | 7:30 am Who says kids can&apos;t fly? In the world of our four year old, Declan, one needs only a relatively deep pool prepared for landing. Combining his refreshingly wet destination with a bounce in his step or a boost from Dad, Declan has all he needs to soar through the skies over and over like superman. And soar he does, jumping in his grandparent&apos;s pool repeatedly until mommy declares it is time to go. He waits only for his swimmies before leaping, not stopping to even check the temperature. &quot;Throw me! Throw me!&quot; is his chant. He&apos;s fearless.

 I went to Cars Land and all I got was this stupid lice infestation 
 Kristy 11 Jul 2012 | 10:57 am I bet you thought I didn’t make it out of Disneyland alive. Well, I did. Not only did we make it out alive, we brought home a few extra friends in the form of a lice infestation! (I’m assuming they came from Disneyland because when I looked at them under a magnifying glass I noticed they were wearing teeny tiny mouse ears with their names embroidered on the back.) My niece was the only one officially infested. KNOCK ON WOOD. To be fair, they may have come from the airplane, or the school bus, or the homeless man that babysits on occasion. We don’t know where she picked it… 
 The tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth 
 Kristy 2 Jul 2012 | 10:36 am Karis lost her first tooth on Saturday. In sticking with the theme of having major milestones happen in the rare moments when I’m not around, Karis’tooth decided to jump ship while she was running an errand with her dad. (If this keeps up she’ll start her period on a father-daughter camping trip, get her license while I’ve run to the store, have her first kiss while I’m folding laundry (that one is okay–I shouldn’t be there for the first kiss) and get a college acceptance letter while I’m stuck at the DMV.) She called me from the car, her… 
 About my butt 
 Kristy 28 Jun 2012 | 10:35 am It must be Over-sharing Thursday! Hi Internet. I am typing this while standing because I can’t sit down. I have a boil on meh buttocks. (That is not a spelling error. When telling the internet you have a boil on your butt you have to say it just that way.) At first I thought getting a boil on my ass was just another joy of aging. I was wrong though. Anyone at any age can enjoy a boil if the conditions are right. I did a little research and it would seem a boil is what happens when staph bacteria comes home from dropping out of college and can’t get a job, so your hair follicle…

 Catching Up on Women Having It All and the Atlantic Magazine 
 11 Jul 2012 | 4:46 am I&apos;ve been on vacation, so imagine my disappointment to miss a raging, rich discussion of &quot;Why Women Still Can&apos;t Have It All,&quot; an article in the Atlantic Magazine by former top government official Anne-Marie Slaughter. I started reading the piece intending to dislike it -- because of the title&apos;s assumption that only women struggle with work-family balance -- but ended up agreeing with almost everything Slaughter wrote. The nearly 12,000 word piece makes critically important points about the need for workplaces to become more flexible and our society to redefine success and career arcs, as…

When school broke up at the beginning of June – yes in Italy the summer holidays are quite substantial…three months of it! – We flew off to Spain for a tennis camp that lasted two weeks. It was a great experience for my son who got to mix with children from all over the world and play tennis on clay. Let’s just say he liked it so much that after three days he asked if could stay indefinitely. Now that we are back home and I got my everyday life and work in order we have resumed our crafts and art projects. Today I would like to share my… 
 Recycled crafts: double sided animal placemats 
 Maria 1 Jun 2012 | 5:53 am Today I have a very easy and useful craft to share with all you lovely readers. My special double-sided animal placemats made with old calendar paper and colourful thick paper. The drawings are very simple images of animal faces, we have chosen koala, lion and hippo faces, but any animal of your choice is fine. We traced the animal on the white side of the calendar page and cut it with scissors. Then we placed the already cut shape on a piece of coloured card and we cut the same identical shape out of the card. The next step consists of gluing the two together. Once they are dry we added some…

The grooves on one strip need to correspond exactly…

When I felt that inertia stealing over me, I rested; and while resting my power recuperated–the tide rose in me.”-Elizabeth Towne, 1904 There is a quote on money that is similar to the one above. I’ve read it once, twice, a million times. It’s popular enough that I’ll read it again next month, but for the life of me I can’t find it online or in any of my books. Roughly paraphrased, money ebbs and flows much like the ocean’s tide. It goes in…

Too busy to bother. A diet-coke to help me make it to lunch. The small shot of caffeine is enough to give me energy to read later than usual, so I stay up late. I have to wake up at the same early hour, though, so I drink two diet cokes and make it past lunch. Those diet cokes mean I can stay up even later, and by the time a week has passed, I’m drinking iced coffees throughout the day to stay awake. I’m not…

 Six Tips for Reading More Often 
 Megan@SortaCrunchy 10 Jul 2012 | 12:24 pm One of my favorite book bloggers is a returning SortaCrunchy sponsor this summer. Just in time for mid-summer doldrums, Jessica of Quirky Bookworm is here to share six tips for reading more often: Me, 27 years ago. When Sarah Bessey recently said that she has “always read for oxygen”  – it resonated with me. Because books are oxygen for me too! I’ve read voraciously for as long as I can remember. I loved to read while nursing my daughter Eleanor when she was teeny-tiny, but starting at age eight months or so, she’d quit nursing and try desperately to grab my book if she heard me… 
 So, we&apos;ve gone Paleo. (sorta) 
 Megan@SortaCrunchy 9 Jul 2012 | 10:05 am As many of you know, Kyle and I have been eating low-carb (most of the time) for about a year and a half now. Initially, we did it to lose weight (and it worked!) and we also realized that as much as we loved the taste, texture, and experience of carb-y foods, we genuinely felt better when we weren&apos;t eating them. Eventually, however, our enthusiasm for this dietary change began to wane. Frankly, I think we just got bored with it. Added to that was the huge inconvenience of constantly preparing separate meals for the girls. We didn&apos;t feel comfortable taking carbs out of their diets, and so…

 Happy Hour Mom 
 
 how a traveling mom stays connected, a day in the life… 
 Shannon 8 Jul 2012 | 11:44 pm As many of our readers know, my family and I have spent the past 7 years traveling the world while my husband played basketball. We had our first daughter in December of 2004 and left for Japan in August of 2005. You can only imagine the disappointment of our family members when their daughter, son, granddaughter/niece/cousin left the country for a 10-month-season in Japan. I was a newlywed, and a 22 year-old new mom, who was living in a foreign country with very few english speakers in the small little town that we were living in. Our first few weeks were extremely difficult, as I was… 
 the ultimate independence day bash 
 Toni 2 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am Independence Day is the peak of the summer. It’s hard to believe that it is already here. Since the fourth of July holiday falls on a Wednesday this year it is hard to assume how everyone will be celebrating.  Most will have the day free from work and will be able to partake in festive activities as usual. But this is  a popular time of year for families to take long vacations as well. A Fourth of July bash doesn’t have to be a formal affair where you bring out the fine china. It doesn’t mean it automatically has to equal burgers and brats, either. If that is a tradition, go for it. 
 summer family fun | do’s and don’ts of bike ride adventures 
 Toni 23 Jun 2012 | 8:51 pm The best thing we could have done for our family this summer is to round up bikes for us all. Our new favorite family past time is to release everyday stresses by returning home for a busy day and jumping on our bikes for a quick adventure. Mother’s Day was not just a holiday to spend celebrating the worlds most challenging job. This year my 4 year old gave me the special gift of learning to ride his bike without training wheels, the morning of. With all of our recent adventures I’ve learned a lot about bike safety and how to travel prepared for many situations. Though skinned…

 Disconnected Memory, Reconnected Relationship 
 Melanie Edwards 4 Jul 2012 | 6:01 am As ironic as it seems, my dad’s dementia and memory loss is strangely helping us to reconnect. My father and I have never been very close–not in the way you normally think of a father-daughter relationship. We had no issues and did have a relationship, just not an emotionally close one. My father was a typical, old-fashioned, Puerto Rican father. That means that while he was a provider and was there for us as a husband and father, he was never the go-to guy for talking about problems. He did not nurture, play, or goof around. He did provide: he worked hard, provided financially… 
 7 Simple Ways to Get Your eBay Items Sold! 
 Melanie Edwards 1 Jul 2012 | 7:24 pm My adventure in learning about selling on eBay continues. This last month, I tried to sell a couple of items–a Disney-engraved Swarovski crystals business card holder and a book. Neither item sold, unfortunately, but I received great feedback from other eBay sellers on how I can fix my listings when I relist the items. In particular, Windy Mayes Sibbersen of windylou.com and a fellow eBay Parent Panel member, provided me with a lot of input and suggestions. 1. Study other listings. Look at listings for the same items and see how those sellers have described the item. Also look… 
 Easy Kid-Friendly Recipe: Zucchini and Cheese 
 Melanie Edwards 27 Jun 2012 | 3:11 pm Editor’s Note: Enjoy this wonderful recipe from guest contributor, Adriana Martin! From many moms, I have learned how difficult it is to get kids to eat their veggies. I thought a great idea would be to combine zucchini with cheese, making for a delicious way to introduce this vegetable to children using familiar flavors. This is what you will need: Zucchini and Cheese Kid-Friendly Recipe Ingredients: 3 fresh zucchinis, cut in cubes ½ cup of chopped white onion 1 spoon of butter or margarine 1 cup of crème fresh or sour cream Salt and pepper or “cubitos de pollo” (chicken stock…

 Rebecca and Tippy 
 17 Jun 2012 | 6:24 pm Rebecca rocked a horse show Saturday at Integrity Equestrian Center in Holden. She rode Tippy and anyone who knows anything about Miss Tippy Toes knows she is famous for navigating through cones on her own and being very stubborn when it&apos;s time to kick it up from walking to trotting. Despite this latter trait and the fact that Tippy gives a bouncy ride as she loves to run on her tip toes (hence the name), Rebecca won a first and second place ribbon. My baby has made a ton of progress in the past year. Here is Rebecca and Tippy strutting their stuff:(I&apos;m having some technical troubles… 
 A Masterpiece In Gingerbread

The kids had lots of fun eating pizza and building their house, even if the end result proves that they are better artists than engineers.Here&apos;s the proof that at one point the house was standing:Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t survive the car ride quite so well. Here&apos;s what it looked like by the time we got it home:Oh well. On the plus side, in the its present state it&apos;s harder to tell that I&apos;ve been stealing all the gumdrops off the house.

 Gray Tutu Day 
 Aidan Donnelley Rowley 12 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am Dad died four years ago today. He died at four-something in the morning which, apparently, is an hour at which many people die, or turf it, as Dad would prefer. I wish I remember the exact time it happened. For whatever reason, I long for this detail. We’d all been waiting for this moment to come, this final moment. The hospice nurse with the kind face that’s now blurry updated us in smoky whispers that were ostensibly meant to soothe. It will be days, hours, anytime now. We sat around the long, wood dining table in my family’s kitchen, alternately giddy and groggy with the… 
 Needing Nature 
 Aidan Donnelley Rowley 11 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am I am so happy they pick up the worms and play with the ants. That they aren’t scared of the critters that abound out back. They are far less squeamish than I am and this makes me happy because it’s one of my biggest concerns about raising them here in New York City. Will they be exposed enough to nature? I wonder this. And it matters to me. I grew up here and love that I grew up here, but my parents whisked me away on weekends to the lush green of the Berkshires, in summers to the waters of Wisconsin, at Thanksgiving-time to the marshes of South Carolina. And it’s not just… 
 The Chase Game 
 Aidan Donnelley Rowley 10 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am At school this year, Big Girl played something called the Chase Game in P.E. I think this is the way it went…One kid would get a head-start and begin running around the gym and then a few moments later, the next kid would take off and chase the first kid, and try to tag him/her. My girl loved this game. I think the fact that she is fast, and often won, had something to do with her enthusiasm for the game. As she described the game to me after she first played it, I immediately thought of the fact that some kids wouldn’t win, and that everyone would be sitting there, watching. It…

 Don’t Take a Summer Sales Snooze! Now is the Time to Turn Up the Heat on the Competition 
 Carla Young 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am The big excuse everyone uses for slowing down their sales efforts in the summer is “No one is available to take meetings so why should I bother?” Yes, admittedly summer does make sales a little more challenging and yes, sometimes meetings do get put off or delayed because of vacation schedules, but that’s no reason to put your sales on hold until the fall. The reason YOU should bother is because most don’t so the summer is the best time to get a jump on the competition. For every prospect who is away, there are plenty who take the summer slow down to catch-up. Chances are because you… 
 Skip the Cocktail This Summer and Save Yourself the Extra Pounds This Winter 
 Theresa Albert 11 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Nutri-News: Are Cocktail Calories Worth It? It is a North American phenomena contributing to our collective obesity issue: we gain a pound on average, every winter, mostly over the holidays. Summer eating can be simple, fresh, healthy fare that will help you lose that pound and prevent the dreaded 10 per decade. But here is the catch: you have to factor account for the beer/wine/martinis on the deck. That’s what will keep you in the blubbery red. Unlike everything else we eat, alcohol calories cannot be used as fuel. Those extra calories can only be converted by the liver to be stored as… 
 Unlock Thousands of Memories: A Simple Way to Archive Your Family History 
 Carley Knobloch 10 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Opening a shoebox of old photographs is like unlocking the door to your personal history, flooding your senses with the moments (and the occasional misguided outfit) that shaped who you are. It’s amazing what old photos bring back. That’s assuming, of course, that you can find the shoebox somewhere in the depths of your garage. Or it’s not in your great aunt’s closet. Oooor, it hasn’t been lost to a flood in your basement. Our precious memories deserve better than this, don’t they? Don’t we all want to honor our old family photos, especially ones of…

 Foodie Friday Mission Organics Tortilla Chips Review and Giveaway with Beet Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream - Keeping Portland Weird 
 Finamoon 22 Jun 2012 | 11:56 am I received three 13 oz. bags of Mission Organics Tortilla Chips to try, each in a different flavor variety: Blue Corn, White Corn, and Multi Grain. These are all USDA certified organic tortilla chips that start off as masa (maize (corn) dough made from freshly prepared hominy) made from organically grown corn. The tortillas are cooked in organic oil and topped with fresh sea salt for a traditional taste. I really liked the blue corn and multi grain the best myself. These chips curb my salty, crunchy snack craving and are great with my homemade salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. I however…

 Why It’s Important to Sneak Away from the Kids for a Weekend 
 Audrey McClelland 11 Jul 2012 | 7:03 pm I’m going to be honest here, I never (ever, ever) thought Matt and I would ever go away without the boys. Ever. I’m a nervous nelly mom, so quite honestly, I never thought I could handle leaving them alone without one of us.  I know that I travel for work a ton, but when I’m gone, they’re with Matt. I can handle that. I feel good about that. I just never thought I had the capacity within myself to leave them alone without (gasp) either one of us. But…I did it (well, we did it) this past weekend and it was incredible. Absolutely, positively incredible. I never…

 INSTANT SURVIVAL TIP: Those magical 2-liter bottles, again! 
 thesurvivalmom 9 Jul 2012 | 3:57 pm image by Muffet I recommend the 2-liter bottle as a food storage must-have so often that people have asked,“How much soda do you drink,anyway??”With super hot summer temperatures present across the country, combined with power outages, those wonderful 2-liter bottles come in handy yet again! Get ready for the next heat wave by filling clean bottles with water and freezing. Here’s how they can help: Multiple bottles of frozen water in your freezer will help keep food frozen longer. When the power goes out, put a few of these bottles in the fridge to lower the temperature… 
 A camping skill basic: Safe fire building 
 thesurvivalmom 8 Jul 2012 | 3:12 am Guest post by Craig who blogs at The Nature Nurd. image by Jon Cage One of the best ways to build survival/preparedness/self-reliance skills is to do so under a controlled environment.  What better place to build a variety of skills AND to get your family involved then during a camping trip? Whether its 10 degrees outside or a 100, fire is a natural and often a necessary part of camping. You can cook on it, boil water, use it to keep warm, and just generally feel comfortable just because you have a fire.  I’d like to share with you some safe and helpful tips for building a safe fire… 
 8 Vital skills to teach your children that will trump an Ivy League education 
 thesurvivalmom 7 Jul 2012 | 5:42 pm image by vastastateparkstaff A few weeks ago I was in a particularly depressed mood. That’s not the norm for me, but this time it was completely justified. I was pondering my children’s futures. College prices have sky-rocketed, far surpassing wage increases. My daughter will be ready for college in five years. Will we be able to afford a college education for her or even pay a percentage of it?  And, if she does go to college, what will she major in that will provide a reliable career in a world whose future is increasingly unreliable? Perhaps my kids should learn a trade that…

 hot summer day fun: crayon melts! 
 amy 11 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am It’s been so incredibly hot here in Maryland, I’m sure you can fry an egg on the sidewalk. At least I’m guessing you can because it’s been upwards of 100 degrees but it feels about a million.  And muggy.  And really sticky.  And buggy. But because it’s been so hot, we’ve been taking it pretty easy—reading, doing some writing, and trying out a few (can’t wait to share them!) new-for-us things and a handful of throwback crafts. There was one day, however, when we did get a little cra-zeee, and I used the day’s sweltering weather to teach the kids a little bit about how…

We kind of put it on the back burner until much later–months later, in fact–when one random day after school, Maddy started to make the…

 Establishing boundaries! 
 gettrich 9 Jul 2012 | 11:28 am It’s high time I started establishing healthy boundaries. I have boundary issues. I never really knew this until recently when we invited our dog trainer to come to the house and assist us in curtailing some of our dog’s negative behaviors. I thought it was silly when she asked me go toe to toe with the sleeping pup at my feet. “But I’ll wake her,” I insisted. “But she’s lying on your feet.” The trainer countered. “Just come around to the front of her and tell her to move.” I reluctantly did as instructed and my adoring fur ball barely looked up at me. “Come on,” I… 
 Achtung! 
 gettrich 2 Jul 2012 | 12:44 pm I’m not one to use a 1940s German political image lightly. I abhor the over-use of phrases like “Gestapo tactics.” I shudder when pop culture coins a catchy phrase like “soup nazi.” But once in a while, only when appropriate, one has to invoke the Fascist Arian party to accurately describe a governing system so out of control that its abuse of power must be called out in order to protect its inhabitants and preserve the rights of citizens throughout the free world. Unfortunately, that time is now. As I write this, I have in my hand two letters from our home owners association… 
 Seattle shivers 
 gettrich 22 Jun 2012 | 9:34 pm When I first visited Arizona, I remember my dismay at having forgotten my swim suit back in Chicago. I rushed over to the local Target to pick up a new one and was stunned to learn that, although it was a balmy 80 degrees outside, it was March and out of season so no swim suits were available. I found that to be odd. After all, coming from 30 below zero weather in the Windy City, 80 degrees was not only swim suit temperature to me, it was “sit out by the pool with a virgin strawberry daiquiri reading Cosmo and bathing myself in Bain de Soleil” weather. I’d nearly forgotten the episode.

 Silly old bear 
 poisedpen 16 Jun 2012 | 11:17 am Silly old bear. It’s one of my favorite lines from A.A. Milne tales of the little boy named Christopher Robin whose fluffy companions include a bear called Winnie the Pooh. I’ve got Pooh on the brain today after reflecting a bit more on the transition to a new blog site. I’m remembering my early days with our oldest son Christopher, whose room as a toddler was decorated with all things primary colors and Pooh. Christopher has been a part of our lives for more than two decades, and I’ve been affiliated with Raising Arizona Kids for nearly that long — joining the staff when my three… 
 Fertile field, empty nest

It’s been a fertile field for parents to grow, nurture and share experiences for more than two decades. The “Stage Mom” blog has thrived there, growing into a tree of sorts with branches reaching far beyond the Valley of the Sun. I’m grateful for the roots that’ve made the next part of the “Stage Mom” journey possible. Soon I’ll be leaving the nest to take “Stage Mom” solo, though I know I’ll never really have to fly…

 Peas In A Pod (A Life Update) 
 Sierra 5 Jul 2012 | 3:36 pm We went camping recently. In fact, all kinds of things have been going on, here in real life. Martin went to Brazil and Argentina to visit family and old friends and give a speech at his old high school. I was flying solo with the kids for almost three weeks. Before that I spent 10 days in California with my best friend and her new baby and her family, and went to a great conference on nonmonogamy. June was a full month. Very full, like how could I pack so much living into one short month? And yet I did, and it was wonderful. This month is stretching out before us in a vast uncharted expanse… 
 Touring the Blog Graveyard, Wondering What To Read Now 
 Sierra 4 Jul 2012 | 11:32 am So anyone who has been with me for awhile has noticed that I blog a lot less than I used to. My kids are just as awesome as ever, full of funny quips and heart-string-tugging insights (remind me to tell you about the‘peas in a pod’incident). My life didn’t suddenly become dull; if anything it’s more interesting than ever: the kids are growing and changing all the time, and so am I. As an inveterate diarist, I have a lot to write about. But I’ve hit this wall of resistance that stops me from writing. I’ve posted about it some, but it’s worth saying a… 
 The Problem with Guinea Pigs 
 Sierra 2 Jul 2012 | 11:48 am So we have these two baby guinea pigs now; they’ve been here for about two weeks during which time they’ve nearly doubled in size. They’re extremely cute and docile; the kids are wildly in love with them. I doubt I’ll ever bond with a guinea pig, but even I have to admit these little guys are sweet. The girls have named them Cocoa and Fuzzy. Here’s the problem: Martin’s girlfriend is terribly allergic to them. So allergic she can’t come in the house at all. I wish I’d known about this before we adopted them. The whole process happened kind of…

 9 Jul 2012 | 7:19 am i&apos;m a lover of the great outdoors, rides and just living free. there is nothing more soothing than the love of your family in your arms and knowing that no one else in this world matters but them. i often forget about work and everything else when i&apos;m just with them. whether we&apos;re on a train ride, a car ride or watching movies at home....they free my soul like no other. i hope your family does the same for you! xoxo

 Good things: Naot summer sandals 
 ewiller 11 Jul 2012 | 11:30 am When it comes to summer shoes, I usually stick with one pair of sandals and basically wear them into the ground. At the same time, however, I’m trying to pretend I’m a grown up and actually push myself out of my comfort zone, once in a while, and wear some high heels. Particularly on nights out.  Heels!  Heels are scary, sometimes. I probably don’t really know how to walk in them properly. So when I do get some heels, I try to make sure that they are at least a decent brand of footwear that won’t entirely cripple me when I stumble and trip over myself wear them. And… 
 Feeding babies, the epic version 
 ewiller 4 Jul 2012 | 8:14 pm So the nursing bras are in the garbage bin. Most of them were almost 7 years old–which sounds ancient, but overall they were only really worn for about a year and a half. Two of them were new, only a year old, and even had underwire–woooo. But they still didn’t support like a regular bra. I have to say, I’m very happy to be back in the regular bras. Happy and perky. I briefly contemplated burning those bras as I chucked them in the bin, but thought it best that they not go out with a bang. We had a complicated relationship, breastfeeding and I. And now it has come… 
 A Muskoka Woods Weekend 
 ewiller 28 Jun 2012 | 11:42 am When the opportunity was presented to me, to be able to spend a quick weekend away at a residential summer camp called Muskoka Woods with my oldest child, I couldn’t say no. I mean, okay, I could have said no. I could have said that I shouldn’t leave the baby or the logistics would be too difficult, or that Mr. Middle Child would be too jealous, but it really seemed like the perfect thing to do. To connect one-on-one with Oliver, at a time when maybe his behaviour has been a little trying–to do something special for and with him? It was important to me to say yes. I have…

 How to Start a Summer Reading Program for your child 
 Jacqueline Rembrandt 4 Jul 2012 | 7:47 pm Generally, I can’t wait for summer because I get a break from homework and chaperoning my child from one activity to the next. However, this summer after reading How to GetYour Child to be a Fanatic Reader as reported by cnn.com, I am going to make sure I get my child to read 3 – 4 books over the summer. I hope you are inspired to do the same with your child(ren). Here’s how: 1.      Inform your child of the goal you are setting for them. This is a very important step. You want to make sure your child is onboard with reading the… 
 How to Wash Your Laundry in 4 Minutes 
 Jacqueline Rembrandt 8 Feb 2011 | 7:37 am Recently, when I found that I was so busy living life that my laundry hamper was about to explode, I began to panic. Wondering how am I going to get my laundry done while I work, pick my son up from school and cook dinner. Since I don’t have the luxury of having a washing machine and dryer at home, I remembered seeing a sign at the laundromat that I frequent stating the 4 minute wash. I decided to inquire about the 4 minute wash. What do I have to lose at worst it could be a crock or there really could be a way to get your clothes washed in 4 minutes, if only I would inquire about. So I… 
 Start Dating Again -- Especially if you are Married 
 Jacqueline Rembrandt 17 Dec 2010 | 10:38 am Your Ad Here Are you married or do you have a significant other? I am married and when I saw the movie Date Night, I became very embarassed. Let me tell you why. Before we got married we went on dates and spent alot of quality time together. Now we are married, have a child and have settled into a routine. Is this a mistake? I somewhere &quot;50% of all marriages end in divorce&quot;. Before seeing the movie Date Night, I didn&apos;t understand what all the fuss was about when people would say you need to treat your wife like your girlfriend and your husband like your…

 dear jude · day 1,041 
 11 Jul 2012 | 10:29 am Dear Jude, Day one-thousand and forty-one: Our love affair madness continues, unchecked and exponential. This morning you turned around and told me, &quot;I&apos;m going to KILL you, mom.&quot; I laughed, because you were kidding at the time, not being a psychopath, and also because that is funny. I didn&apos;t let you see me laugh, because that would be wrong and that is not a thing you should say, ever. I chastised and redirected you, as I am supposed to do, because I don&apos;t actually want you to grow up to be a psychopath. I&apos;m not sure who is responsible but a groundbreaking life-changing turn of events has… 
 itchy brain syndrome 
 9 Jul 2012 | 7:29 am Between goings on at work and busy at home I am as grouchy as a cat in a sack. I&apos;m not sure if that means I need to talk to more people, or talk to no one to save the universe from experiencing my madness. I&apos;m going to take it hour by hour. One thing I do know is that I should ban myself from shopping online until this ends ....alllllmost immediately. I just need... a few.... things. Like this. And this. Have I mentioned I love you? Great. Glad we could clear that up. In case you missed it last week: Our Most Awesome American (Movie) Presidents. Show me yours and I&apos;ll show you mine. It&apos;s over…

 6 Jul 2012 | 11:44 am Hey, so, blogher is coming at the end of this month (already, oh my god) and it&apos;s about this time of year when a lot of us start trying to &quot;be fit&quot; or &quot;look good,&quot; or whatever, and then get bored/give up and go back to eating ice cream. Not that that&apos;s a confession or anything. (It is.) Anyway, in the interest of beauty and science I desperately needed to mix up my facial routine. Please, let me continue at length. (I will, don&apos;t worry.) I have no idea what changed this past year but my formerly easy-to-care-for skin has flipped it&apos;s prospective shit. I suspect a combination of post-pregnancy…

 Is It Monday Already? 
 
 Waiting is so hard on an idle mind 
 Lisa P@www.isitmondayalready.com 8 Jul 2012 | 11:59 am It has been a bit since I sat down to write a post; it&apos;s not that I have not thought about it,but rather that I have been preoccupied. We or should I say I started packing the house slowly a couple of weeks before we left on vacation a couple of weeks ago. I have been passively looking at homes for rent since we started our walk in January. My search really started once we got our notice of sale.....but still not really actively looking until a couple weeks ago because we wanted to wait as long as possible as to not have a ton of time that we have to keep coming back her to check on the… 
 Update on the Mortgage front 
 Lisa P@www.isitmondayalready.com 22 May 2012 | 9:37 pm Well we received the notice of trustee transfer as well as the trustee sale notice via certified mail on Monday! So if the sale is not postponed, as can happen, the house will be on the auction block 8/20/12. One day after my sixth wedding anniversary. I knew it was coming any day now as we had received two letters from the agency that the mortgage holder has retained to move forward with the foreclosure one week apart about three weeks ago. Another sign was that Citibank sent me an email on Friday that they did an account review and because of a delinquent debt to another creditor, they… 
 Just got back from Vegas 
 Lisa P@www.isitmondayalready.com 26 Apr 2012 | 7:25 pm We were so luck to be able to return to Vegas this past Friday over Monday. We actually had just visited in October so it was crazy to be able to go back so soon. We try to make it a point to go away once per year without the kids (as long as my mom is willing to watch the kids) as we rarely get time alone. Vegas is the place we enjoy going because we can act a total fool and its all good. This was the first time since out honeymoon that we were able to go on a weekend which was so nice; even more so as my brother, sister-in-law, and some friends went at the same time. So nice to hang out…

 9 Jul 2012 | 4:23 pm Today was one of those days when the entire concept of email made me want to throw my laptop across the room.First at 8 am, I was locked out of my Hotmail account because someone (NOT me) had sent out a ton of spam emails. Once I was allowed back in to the account I had so many &quot;undeliverable&quot; emails it was ridiculous.I quickly posted an apology on Facebook and Twitter ... letting everyone know it wasn&apos;t me who spammed their inbox. My former boss (the good one!) replied to my Facebook post &quot;I knew it wasn&apos;t you. The writing was terrible.&quot;That made me laugh.My day went downhill from there.By… 
 Heatwave, power outages, and patience 
 8 Jul 2012 | 8:01 am Last Thursday started out as an OK kind of day. I was &quot;working&quot; from home and Kevin took the day off to spend some time with the kids. I sent him to the grocery store for our weekly groceries and he was planning to take the girls to see the new Katy Perry movie.By early afternoon it was hotter than Hades outside (again) and I was feeling the need for a break from &quot;the job&quot; and the endless frustration that goes along with it. I decided I&apos;d join the husband and kids at the movies and spend the evening finishing my work.Ah...the best laid plans...Just before we went into the movie theater my… 
 Heatwave, storms, falling trees, and no electricty. An epic couple of days. 
 6 Jul 2012 | 2:35 pm So, it&apos;s been hotter than hell around here lately. Someone turned up the thermostat a couple weeks ago and never turned it down. Today, it&apos;s 102 degrees with a heat index of about 106. Or something stupid like that.Yesterday it was hot too.And then a storm popped up.And trees fell down all over the city.And then the lights went out.Today, more than 24 hours later, the power is still out for thousands of people in the Toledo area. Last night the kids and I packed up some stuff, bagged the just-purchased groceries, and headed to my parents&apos; house.We are still hanging out at nana and papa&apos;s…

 5 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am What are your plans for the summer Summer vacation - first off, it goes by way too quickly. Secondly, if you asked the question of me, say, two weeks ago - I would most likely had an entirely different answer for you. As of today....perhaps it would be best to show you and then explain... Lucky for me there are many colors in the hiliting world. This is what I do in the summer for Bear&apos;s schedule because it&apos;s the only way I can keep it straight in my head. I have copies on the fridge, at work and I&apos;ve also given copies to all respective parties so we are all on the same page (literally…

Did you know the passport office opens at 7:30 in the morning? No?...neither did I. So imagine my delight when I rolled to the passport office at 7:40 this morning expecting to wait outside the door until 8:30 and discovered that I could stroll right to the prescreening wicket.Mhm, happy girl. The lady at the wicket was very helpful, and informed me that my information seems to be in order, gave me a numbered ticket and told me to wait for my…

We have geared up for another SIMPLE Service Project, and this time, we’re partnering with Champions for Kids and Arm&amp;Hammer to provide Spinbrush toothbrushes to children in need (#SpinbrushCFK). It’s something my children take for granted, but oral care is a missing ingredient in the lives of many children: Over 19% of children ages 2-19 have untreated cavities. Tooth decay remains one of the most common diseases of childhood. Children living in poverty suffer twice as much tooth decay as…

 Fond Memories of My First Cat 
 Crissy 9 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am What was special about your first cat? Growing up in the country, I had quite a few pets during my childhood. However, the first pet I owned as a grown-up (if you want to call a college student a grown-up) was my beloved Mewson. He was my first baby, and in a lot of ways, my first true love as well. If you’ve been following my journals and blogs online for a while, as I know some of you have, you know Mewson. He came into my life as a tiny little orange furball a decade ago, and I loved him as much if not more than any mother would love her child. He grew to be a beautiful cat, and he…

 15 Things to Do With Pulled Pork 
 Heather 10 Jul 2012 | 6:27 am A while back I posted a recipe for Slow Cooker Pulled Pork.  It’s been one of my most popular recipes and I make it all the time.  The reason I love it so much is that you can take that simple pulled pork from your crock pot and use it in a multitude of ways.  I’ve gathered up 15 things you can do with your pulled pork and I hope it gives you some ideas for an easy week of cooking!  1) Salad - Pulled pork is just as nice cold (or warm if you wish) over a tossed green salad.  Pair it with a creamy ranch dressing and you can’t go wrong. 2) Pizza - get my BBQ…

And it was all for you. It still is all for you. You’re just as feisty as ever.  You love books just like I do.  You like to control everything you can possibly control–…

My two-year-old daughter loves to take pictures. I usually take my camera back and find 50 pictures of the ceiling or the carpet. But sometimes, I see shots that make me see the world through her little eyes. All of these pictures are straight out of the camera, taken by Pigtail. You would be shocked of how many I had to edit out of the bottoms of my various pj pants. I should get dressed more often.

 July 4th, 2012: Friends and Fireworks 
 Rachel 5 Jul 2012 | 12:33 pm Tweet We spent last night with our friends from My Kinda Rain.  Miss Lori is one of those moms who always outdoes herself with food, party favors, and kidlet activities. But, when it comes to the 4th of July, none of that matters to the kidlet crowd.  They just want FIRE. For the hours leading up to twilight, we heard squeaky voice after squeaky voice ask, plead, beg and cajole to be allowed to do fireworks. Never mind the fact the sun was still blazing brightly overhead. . . never mind they wouldn’t be able to see the sparks exploding. They wanted fire. Finally, the Texas sky grew… 
 Grilled Bacon and Blue Burgers with Blue Cheese Aioli

No, if there is“one”food that can conjure more memories of childhood, it is the hamburger. Pan-seared: the smell of beef and pepper and salt wafting through our farm-house, rousing me from whatever book my nose was in. Char-grilled: the voices of my Grandpa, uncles, and Dad discussing the price of cattle while my cousins and I ran races under the Oklahoma sun at my grandparents’house. Growing up as a member of an agricultural…

 Stain Fighting With NEW Laundry Products {Houston Dynamo Ticket Giveaway!} 
 9 Jul 2012 | 8:09 pm All baseball season long, I battled the grass stains on my son&apos;s pants. Yes, it didn&apos;t help that our uniform consisted of WHITE pants, but I thought to myself Hey.. it can&apos;t be THAT hard to keep these suckers clean, right? WRONG. I pre-treated. I soaked. I bleached. I ran the whitest white cycle with the HOTTEST setting on my washing machine. Nothing seemed to help. All season long, I was&quot;that&quot;mom, the mom who&apos;s child had dirty pants. After the season ended, I threw his white pants in the wash one last time with Pinol Laundry Detergent and Cloralex Bleach. Much to…

Days of ice cold lemonade and laying in the hammock with a good book are upon me. One book, in particular, is first on my list. Wife 22, written by Melanie Gideon, kinda hits home for me as I&apos;m transforming into a whole different person since starting a job outside the home. I&apos;ve taken on a new role which, in turn, has made me question my life prior to this pivotal moment. Alice Buckle, in Wife 22, seems to be questioning her own life…

She snatched her baby out of the crib and took this. She&apos;d stumbled across the blog post in a search to connect with other families with congenital heart disease. Annamarie&apos;s daughter had been born with a heart defect just over six months prior. After enduring cross country medical flights and surgery, Annamarie transformed her experience with her daughter into a better future for other babies. Her… 
 Calls to Sterilize Parents of Children Locked in Hot Car Are Wrong and Misplaced 
 7 Jul 2012 | 6:01 pm A three year old little girl remembers her parents had some candy in the console of the car so she goes looking for it. She fills her belly and falls asleep. She never wakes up. She&apos;s dead when her parents find her after a frantic search. They called her super princess. Should her parents be locked up for life with murderers and rapists? A man returns from an overseas trip and goes straight to his home where he picks up his little boy and girl. He&apos;s jet lagged and tired. He drops the little boy off at day care, but he usually doesn&apos;t take the little girl with him. He goes into the office and…

 I Mean, How Could You Not? Heidi Klum’s Must-Have Maxi Skirt Is Less Than $100! 
 Mom Jeanine 12 Jul 2012 | 6:39 am Could supermodel/supermom Heidi Klum look any cooler in that pic above? Even balancing a toddler on her hip, she looks amazing. There’s no doubt in my mind that that fab maxi skirt she is wearing has a lot to do with it. I’m a total sucker for stripes and the colors just make it even more perfect for summer. As soon as I saw this pic of Heidi, I began lusting after that skirt. Love it, too? Not only did I find Heidi’s exact maxi skirt, but it’s not wildly expensive. It’s Alternative Apparel’s Seneca Maxi Skirt and it’s just $88. I already ordered… 
 Selma Blair Shops For a New Umbrella Stroller–So Which One Did She Choose?? 
 Mom Jeanine 12 Jul 2012 | 6:25 am Looks like star moms really are just like the rest of us. That’s Selma Blair and she was recently snapped shopping for a new umbrella stroller for her almost-1-year-old son, Arthur Saint. So which umbrella stroller did Selma choose? An UPPAbaby! Selma was later snapped leaving the store with a red UPPAbaby G-Luxe stroller and we couldn’t agree more with her choice. Not only is the G-Luxe super lightweight, but it’s easy to fold, comes with a convenient carrying strap and there’s a spacious storage basket underneath. Here’s where you can get one just like… 
 Spotted! Pink’s Baby Girl, Willow Sage Hart, Sporting Pretty Pink Converse 
 Mom Jeanine 12 Jul 2012 | 6:15 am You know you’re an awesome mom when you match your little girl’s sneakers to you hair, right? That’s exactly what Pink did during a recent NYC visit and as much as we love her pretty hair hue, we love Willow’s adorable little pink Converse even more. The kicks are classics and they’re great for little ones learning to walk thanks to the supportive, yet flexible soles. If you’ve got a little girl, take a cue from Pink and get her a pair of, well, pink Converse. They’re just $27. Sign up for our newsletter for even more great finds delivered…

 Surprise! 
 8 Jul 2012 | 5:35 am There is a covert operation in action at my house. Thankfully, my children are completely unaware of anything my husband and I do that doesn&apos;t involve them, so the bags of clothing and food that we&apos;ve been assembling hasn&apos;t raised any suspicions. Then again, maybe I should be concerned that they have so little observation skills... I mean, not only is the van cleaned out, but I actually PACKED BAGS yesterday and nobody even blinked an eye.Obviously, none of them have a future in detective work.After watching countless surprise vacation videos, Patrick and I decided to try and spring a trip to…

You are lucky and blessed, indeed.Imagine the feeling of knowing that you would have to answer &quot;No. There isn&apos;t anything to eat. And I don&apos;t have any money to buy any more food...&quot;Imagine the feeling of being that child that is scared to ask. Scared to ask to eat. Scared of the answer and of seeing the sadness or anger in your parents&apos; eyes because the question is asked so often; with the answer always being the same.Imagine the relief of knowing…

 My thoughts on Brave, The Disney/Pixar movie! 
 Mommy Niri 9 Jul 2012 | 7:40 am So by now you would have watched the movie Brave and if you have not, what are you waiting for? I have to admit I am a sucker for movies and if it is kid-friendly then all the better because it means I can share the big theater experience with my family. Movies beyond their age is relegated to watch-on-the-small-screen section. Needless to say I am a huge fan of Disney movies but also am wary of stereotypical roles for girls. Recently the roles of princesses have been pretty vocal and independent type but they still had one thing that was a pet peeve of mine: a prince. © Disney/Pixar, Inc.

 How Do I Keep Good Going? By Raising The Next Generation of Awesome 
 Big Binder 11 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am Our trip to Chicago in May was a really fun, really exciting, really entertaining family adventure. Going to Shedd Aquarium, LEGOLAND, the Hellenic Museum along with just being in the Big {Windy} City for a few days was exhilarating. More happened there than what I have shared with you though.  And it was neither fun nor entertaining. I make no apologies for not shielding my kids from real life.  We volunteer and are actively engaged with our community not just for the feel good effect; but in our opinion it is the single best way not to raise kids who believe they are the center of the… 
 Here I {Still} Am – Five Years Later 
 Big Binder 8 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am On July 8, 2007 I wrote my first blog post ever. I didn’t have the slightest idea what I was doing, but I did know that I was good at rounding up ideas for parents and that there was a lot of fun to be had in Grand Rapids. I kept my ideas in a binder {yup, a big one} and emailed them out to friends as the events came closer.  When my email list grew so big that I had to split it up so Hotmail didn’t think I was spam, Big Binder was born.  It was simply easier to start a blog and tell everyone about it.  At that time,‘everyone’was a couple hundred people in Grand…

 Marinka 11 Jul 2012 | 4:47 am Young Ladrinka and I had a splendid Sunday planned last weekend, centered around the fact that we were heading to CitiField to watch our beloved Mets play. But before we headed out to the stadium, Young Ladrinka shared with me that he knows that Husbandrinka and I love our daughter more, and that he is a distant second and that usually he is ok with that state of events, but that particular morning it was hard for him to take. He had a good point, of course, because this was brought on by the fact that he and I were at a local grocery store and I, already holding 2 pounds of stewing beef and… 
 What I Learned While Reading “The Hot Zone” 
 Marinka 8 Jul 2012 | 6:52 am As you may remember, this summer my daughter and I are reading The Hot Zone, Richard Preston’s account of the Ebola epidemic. Obviously I’m reading it under duress and already have diagnosed myself with Ebola so I’m just awaiting the autopsy to confirm my findings (by the way, one of Papa’s favorite jokes is the autopsy revealed that the cause of death was the autopsy. Yes, he is available for parties, why do you ask?) But I’ve also learned a few interesting facts from the book and I’m going to share them with you here, absolutely free of charge. Ready? 1.

Without time to read the huge instruction manual or take a photography class, like many people, I just left it on auto and went on my merry way.

 dismissed from nighttime duty 
 bethany actually 11 Jul 2012 | 11:31 pm E fell asleep cuddling with Gramaw one night in Hawaii It’s the middle of the night. I was awakened a few minutes ago by the sound of Elliora calling,“Mama, Maaaamaaaa…”on the monitor, so I walked down the hall to her room to check on her. (She doesn’t wake up every night anymore—probably more like every other night, maybe every third night.) I changed her diaper, as we usually do when she wakes up at night, just because. As I changed her, she was whining and fussing, asking to“murssh”the whole time. I told her it wasn’t time for…

In Hawaii, we stayed quite busy sightseeing and eating delicious food and riding buses and walking (and walking and walking) and swimming in the pool and ocean and hanging out with Lauren. 3. Our hotel—apparently thinking it was still 2004—did not have free wifi in the rooms. 4. The lack of free wifi, not to mention free time, made it very difficult for me to fully participate in 7 Days. It was the first time in five years that’s happened. I’ve done 7 Days 21 times in a row, through cross-country moves, pregnancy, caring for a newborn,…

 Review: It Works! 
 10 Jul 2012 | 6:02 pm When I was younger, I have to admit to you I had a tiny, flat stomach (didn’t we all?). I was so proud of my stomach. I would show it off at any chance. I had a closet full of mid-drift bearing shirts that I wasn’t afraid to wear. After having two babies, I threw all those shirts out. My stomach is the biggest embarrassment about my body. And yes, I know I’ve born two beautiful, healthy babies and the extra weight that they’ve left me saddled with should be a badge of honor (or is that stretch marks?) but so have the chocolate cupcakes I adore so much. So recently, I have taken to…

 10 Jul 2012 | 5:49 pm I remember the first time I ever received a gift certificate. Yes, I said certificate because back in my day (when we walked up hill in snow both ways to school) that’s what they were. No one had ever heard of a gift card. Today, it’s the gift to give. I love getting gift cards. The possibilities are endless plus you don’t have to waste time returning a gift you didn’t want in the first place. And now that gift cards are so popular, you have to think about what to put them in when you give them. I’m one of those gals that just hates handing over a plastic card and nothing else. I… 
 Summer Bugs Suck! 
 6 Jul 2012 | 5:23 pm Summer is in full effect here in Florida. This means that it is hot hot hot (seriously, HOT) and there are bugs everywhere. I&apos;ve lived in Florida my entire 31 years, so you would think I&apos;d be cool with it. But I&apos;m not... well, okay maybe I am. But the thing is I can take the heat (you just dress cooly and stay near a body of water at all times), but the bugs. Oh, the damn bugs. We have mosquitoes from hell, gnats and biting flies. Yes, biting flies. They are the worse. They look like normal flies that buzz around and drive you crazy, but they bite. Their bite is a specific kind of pain too.

 Sunny 16: A Keep It Simple Solution for Outdoor Summer Photography 
 Dawn 5 Jul 2012 | 10:10 pm Students of photography know not to expect the best results in direct afternoon sunlight: look for shade or try to shoot in early morning or late evening. Unfortunately, ball games, afternoons at the pool, trips to the beach, and vacations in general make this easier said than done. A couple of years ago a Google search lead me to the Sunny 16 rule, a lifesaver for summer afternoon photography. I tend to shoot wide open—at a low f-stop—which allows a lot of light into the camera, gives a shallow depth of field, and blurs the background. Shooting wide open in full sun, however, is a good…

 How do you stay connected? 
 Alexia 9 Jul 2012 | 9:27 am  So, for mothers, and others who work at home keeping in touch with outside sources is a must. Your connections to companies, brands, and just people you work on anything with is vital. Skype makes this possible. I use Skype conference calling to stay in touch with contacts, when we need to dicuss the logistics of a campaign. Being able to share ideas and speak in a manner that transcends a regular phone call is key. Skype makes this possible. One of the most important things for me about these calls is that they are free as long as the other party is using Skype as well. I save on… 
 Keep it in the family 
 Alexia 26 Jun 2012 | 8:49 am It’s time to say more and stay human.  It’s time for Skype. Staying in touch with those who are close to you when they are not close by can be a challenge. Email and phone calls as well a photo accounts of your life are one way to do this, but the best way to stay in touch is Skype. You can chat live, while watching the people you normally wouldn’t have the opportunity to see, right in front of you. They get to see you live as well. This way you can share a more intimate chat, and when little ones are involved it can be a lot of fun. When we talk to my parents we have our… 
 YooHoo! 
 Alexia 3 Jun 2012 | 8:06 pm Adorable. These plush toys are a lot of fun, and they are pretty unusual looking; this little guy stands out among my daughters collection of stuffed animals, and she takes him everywhere as he is little and easy to tote around. When you give him a squeeze, he makes a little roaring sound! There’s a whole interactive website based on these little guys http://yoohoo.auroraworld.com/

 Eren Mckay 10 Jul 2012 | 6:22 am Adding exfolation to your weekly routine is a great way to ensure that your skin always looks radiant and glows. When you exfoliate you’re eliminating the build up of dead skin cells. If you’ve ever noticed someone’s skin looking dull, it’s because they haven’t exfoliated much. It also helps with acne problems because it prevents the pores from getting clogged. © Gloffs |Stock Free Images Exfoliating is an essential part of your skin routine.

 the story of etensh 
 11 Jul 2012 | 9:32 pm Yesterday was our first full day in Ethiopia. In the morning, we hopped on a bus that took us away from the bustling capital city of Addis Ababa and into the valley region near the river of Zeway. In this rural area, plagued by difficulty with soil and lack of crops, Food for the Hungry has identified over 1500 at-risk children to be in their program. These children are chosen by local community leaders, and some are placed in the Child-Headed Household program, which offers even more support than the typical child sponsorships. I want to tell the story today of one of the Child-Headed…

I am currently sitting on a plane bound for Atlanta, where I will meet up with the rest of my blogging team.  From there, we catch a 10-hour flight to Amsterdam, followed by a 10-hour flight to Addis Ababa. I’m feeling pretty excited right now. I suspect I might be feeling pretty tired and crabby come 3am. I love travelling, but man . . . the “getting there” part is not my favorite. (Is it anyone’s favorite part??) My lucky husband is one of those people who falls asleep… 
 india’s big cut 
 9 Jul 2012 | 9:55 pm India has been begging to get a “bob” for about a year now, every since her best friend got this cute cut: Then India fell in love with the 1999 made-for-tv movie Annie, in which the darling actress also wears a cute bob. The questions started coming more frequently, but I kept putting her off. I love her long hair, and figured she would regret cutting it. India was determined, though, and finally I relented. Her hair was so long that I figured we could probably donate it, so I did some research and decided we would give her hair to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, who makes…

 I Got Your Funny Right Here! 
 Shan 7 Jul 2012 | 12:04 am It’s been a while since I have done one of my“I got your funny right here!”posts. It’s not for lack of finding humorous things to publish, I either keep running out of time or my S.O.S. (Shiny Object Syndrome) is too strong and I forget. That S.O.S. is kind of a pain in the ass. Just sayin’. Today I have some videos for you. And no, I’m not maniacally searching the web for funny shit. I do it the easy way: my husband watches AOTS and I watch the‘around the net’segment for potential blog fodder. Sometimes it’s a win, sometimes… 
 The Free Range Stupid Crashed Through My Gate

But I haven’t had a chance to finish it yet because yesterday morning The Free Range Stupid crashed through my gate. Sorry, Liz. I’ll have the tale of the made-for-FaceBook-Lifetime movie up by Tuesday. Hopefully.

 We Need A Reality Show About People Who Don’t Take Apart The Oreo. 
 Jenni Chiu 11 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am  What we need is a reality show about people who don’t take apart the Oreo before they eat it.  I know some people who don’t do it–not even a little piece.  They are not tempted in any way to lick the creamy insides.  I’d like to hear [...]

 Experiencing the Valley 
 Bekki 10 Jul 2012 | 2:03 pm Yesterday, tragedy struck close to home. A large group of highschoolers and youth staff headed down to the Tygh Valley in Oregon on Sunday afternoon. Two of our previous church families participate in this camp every year, and many kids and staffers I have relationships with are there now. While attempting to take a picture behind a waterfall, a young camper, Caleb Justice, and a counselor, Brett McLean, fell into the water. Both were pulled underneath the water, and drowned. Two young men….Two families who had just sent their sons off to camp…A group of highschoolers prepared for…

When I joined Twitter, I didn’t get it…I couldn’t understand why you’d want to follow a bunch of people you don’t know in real life, and didn’t see what the actual“benefit”was, other than meeting follower requirements for certain PR agencies. My husband (a master networker and worship pastor extraordinaire you can find @THEdavidlindner) encouraged me to keep going,…

Happens to me ALL the time (especially when the weather is warm, and we spend more time outside!) I grew tired of always fixing sandwiches, bean burritos, or mac and cheese on those nights, and wanted to come up with a hearty and healthy meal I could prepare quickly for my family. We call this recipe,“Hannah’s Chili”because it is SO easy to make, that even my 6 year old can almost make it by herself! This has quickly…

 15 Things to Say “No” To and Free Up Your Time 
 The Mom Writes 5 Jul 2012 | 7:36 pm Ever wonder how you can stretch the day so that you have ‘more’ time? Ever crave for just a few more hours to get things done? Ever want time for yourself? Yes, I’ve answered “Yes” to these questions more than once in my life and that is what motivated me to create my first no-do list. However, I’ve been adding to that and now I have a list of 15 things that I say ‘No’ to and surprise, surprise, have ended up enjoying ‘more’ time: 1. Tidying up every hour or worse, every 30 minutes. Trust me, not worth the effort and the hassle. Now I tidy up twice in the day and that’s… 
 5 Frugal Ways to Get Organized : No-Cost, Cheap Hacks to Cut Clutter and Organize Chaos 
 The Mom Writes 2 Jul 2012 | 3:27 am “Dear Prerna, this year, I’m committed to getting organized and removing all the clutter and chaos from our life. However, I’m also committed to sticking to a budget and somehow, organizing seems so expensive. Jars, boxes, bins, labels. They all cost money. Is it possible for me to get an organized home without busting our budget?” -Mary-Anne Luckily for Mary-Anne and anyone else wanting to get organized on a budget, the answer is, “You can!” Organizing doesn’t and shouldn’t mean busting the budget. Isn’t saving money one of the reasons you want to get organized? So, I…

 Smile Brilliant! {Review&amp;Giveaway} 
 Nancy 11 Jul 2012 | 5:57 am I don’t know about you, but one of my biggest insecurities is the color of my teeth.  Don’t get me wrong–they aren’t yellow or anything and I take good care of them, but they aren’t the brilliant white that you see in Hollywood, or on those really genetically blessed people.  I have always wanted to get my teeth whitened but haven’t had a) the time, b) the money, or c) the time! When the people at Smile Brilliant  contacted me about testing out their Brilliantly Simple home teeth whitening system, I was so excited!!  I was even more excited when I… 
 Mango and Smoked Turkey Salad 
 Shera 10 Jul 2012 | 2:11 pm Mango is such a distinct flavor and it’s a very“sunny”fruit. Around here mango is commonly used in smoothies and an ingredient in salsas and other dishes, and they are surprisingly easy to use in your favorite recipes. The flesh of a ripe mango is juicy and tastes like a peach with just a hint of vanilla, but the texture is totally different so not everyone loves raw mango…if texture is an issue for you, don’t write it off in your recipes though or you’ll totally be missing out! Besides delectable flavor, mangos also offer nutrition benefits. One cup of…

 7 Pinterest Life Hacks Worth Trying

 How I’m Forcing Myself Into Becoming a Morning Person

My sleep meter never gets filled, and I pout about it through the morning routine. My dad, on the other hand, leaps out of bed. He’s perky from the get-go, and doesn’t understand why anyone would chose to be otherwise. I remember many of mornings that he would wake me before my alarm would go off, claiming it was past-time for me to…

They borrowed a movie from their best friend at church that they were all just sure was called, “Heiner Drainer Dragon”. Apparently, it’s the German version of the popular movie How to Train Your Dragon . And…

 A Visit to the Nature Park 
 2 Jul 2012 | 6:44 pm Last Saturday my husband and I were drinking coffee before the kids got up and making a plan on what we wanted to do for the day. We both knew that the kids were going to be full of energy, and we didn&apos;t want to spend another weekend window shopping as an excuse to leave the house. There isn&apos;t a lot to do in our area for kids, but I remembered going to a really cool nature park for a school field trip once, so we decided to look it up. Funny enough, it was only 10 minutes from our house! It has walking trails, a lake with fishing and boating, a wild animal rescue center, and a huge public…

 Two brands &apos;shrink&apos; their product line for your kids 
 As Mom Sees It 11 Jul 2012 | 7:34 am With a toddler and a teenager in the house, I have two constant reminders how quickly kids can outgrow or destroy clothes. We like to find fashionable clothes that are also durable; this can sometimes become an impossible chore, especially to find brands that the kids love. Ella isn&apos;t as choosy with her clothing choices as Garrett is. He&apos;s in middle school so he tends to be much more brand-aware. When I think of brands like Calvin Klein, Under Armour and Hurley, I never thought of children&apos;s clothes. Honestly, the first thing that came to mind were underwear, cold weather and sports. But it&apos;s…

 A flawless tan for when you can&apos;t 
 As Mom Sees It 10 Jul 2012 | 5:12 am I definitely notice a slight, naturaldifference between the two ghosts, er, legs. You&apos;ll often hear me say, &quot;I make Casper look dirty,&quot; I am that white. I can&apos;t tan, I just burn, thanks to my freckly, Irish skin. Of course, neither my mom nor my sister ever had this issue so I would hate watching them slather on their tanning oils and lounging for hours in their swimsuits while I sat in 800+ SPF lotion with my big floppy hat, hiding under the table umbrella. While 800+ SPF lotion might be a slight exaggeration, I still have never been able to enjoy a tan and the thought of standing half naked…

 How to Save Water While Watering Your Lawn and Garden 
 The Thrifty Mommy 29 Jun 2012 | 10:22 am It’s almost July and it’s really hot outside! Some areas are lacking rain which can kill your lawn and garden. So how is a person supposed to keep their lawn and garden alive during times of summer heat and water restrictions?  There are ways to use less water, save money, and not break those restrictions. 1.  Use grey water to water your plants. Grey water is simply the water that comes from washing your clothes, dishes, and taking a bath. It is hot here in the south. There have been several summers that we have had water restrictions.

However, many women have managed to achieve success in the field of trading despite leading hectic lifestyles.

 A Few Tools for Work at Home Moms…. 
 Jane 12 Jun 2012 | 8:27 am Most moms dream about working from home as much as possible.  Some moms make it a reality full time, while others try to get home as much as possible.  However, it can be tough to balance work and being home with your children if you don’t have the right tools to get it done.  With the internet, it is getting much easier! Accessing Your Work File  It used to be that you needed to store anything you wanted to take with you on a floppy disk.  Then, you had jump drives, or you could email yourself a file (which is such a hassle).  Now, you can do file sharing over the cloud to get access…

 Eve 6 Jul 2012 | 10:07 pm I joined a free program a while back called the 10K Challenge, and at first I was not sure what it was all about- but after hours of research, using the program, and reading all the forum posts on it I could find- I think it will work. Now don’t get me wrong, it will not work for everyone, but if you work the 30-45 minutes a day like it directs- then I really think it will. I couldn’t be happier! See, everyday you log in there is a short checklist of things to do that day (send out ads, check this, do this, etc) It will not take more than 30 minutes unless you want it… 
 A Few Money Making Adventures to share 
 Eve 29 Jun 2012 | 1:33 am Since the semester ended and I have some free time before the next one starts I went back to my roots and decided to play with some old tried and true money making schemes. The sites below are what I like to call‘fun money’sites, you likely won’t get rich, but it is fun to do and the possibility of making a little money makes it even more fun. The claim is that you can make a ton of money- and it IS completely possible, back when I did sites like this before I have made good money. Below are some of the sites I am using, if you are new and want some more instruction…

I will re-apply in the spring for the nursing program, and assuming I keep my GPA up then I will have no problem getting in that time. Then I will finish my AA in nursing and be able to jump right into the bachelor program without having to worry about general education…

 Wordless Wednesday: Our Antique Piano’s New Tune 
 Stacey Nerdin 10 Jul 2012 | 7:01 pm {This week we’ve had a specialist here to take a look at our antique piano. We bought it from Craigslist about 6 years ago for $50. Not too shabby for an 1896 mahogany McPhail upright with real ivory keys! The specialist has been performing significant repairs and maintenance, as well as a tuning. He has expressed a clear respect and affection for the piece, and his enthusiasm has made me love the piano that much more. I love hearing how impressive it is for its age, and I love knowing that his hard work and expertise are breathing new life into it. It’s a gorgeous instrument, and… 
 These Oregon Parks Are Calling My Name (National Park and Recreation Month) 
 Stacey Nerdin 8 Jul 2012 | 6:03 pm When my family moved from Oregon to Texas in late 2007, one of the things I didn’t consider was how much our summers would change. Yes, I knew it would be hot, but I did not anticipate our difficulty in acclimating to the high temperatures and humidity. Our long summer days of playing outside in Oregon turned to only quick bursts of activity outside here in Texas, and we usually played in the water instead of at the park. Well, our family is now preparing for a move back to our hometown in Oregon, and summer days at the park are one of the things I’m looking forward to the most!

You will become intimately familiar with the phrase“my lens doesn’t feel like it’s on the right spot on my eye.”3. You will lose your contact somewhere in your eye socket and then, after groping around on your face for the better part of 30 minutes, discover that it somehow folded itself in half up under your eyelid. 4.

 What Nougat, Cindy Brady and a Betta Fish Have To Do With Washing Dishes 
 kludgymom 10 Jul 2012 | 9:10 am There are several words I hate in the English language. Nougat is at the top of my list. It creeps me out. I don’t ever want to eat anything with nougat in it. Just saying the word nougat in my head makes me all twitchy and I squirm around in my chair. I also hate the word phthalate. What the hell is UP with that word? There aren’t enough vowels. I don’t know how to pronounce it, and it’s the only word in normal everyday usage that I can’t spell after looking at it once. It is a creepy word. I want to say“thalalate.”There aren’t two…

 Bobble Bottles 
 Paige Dunn 7 Jul 2012 | 7:56 am I have a new favorite thing I’ve discovered and had to share. There is this great company called Bobble that makes water bottles with filters attached. So often I don’t like the taste of water. It sometimes tastes like chlorine or just kinda yucky. Usually there is a reason for that taste. Instead of going through a zillion bottles of water, why not have one with a filter attached to the cap? So brilliant. I bought my bottle a few days ago and can’t believe the difference in the taste of the tap water. It tastes amazing. I also love it because I have an issue with the fact that I pay… 
 Dear Sweet Baby Girl 
 Paige Dunn 29 Jun 2012 | 10:48 am Dear sweet baby girl, Today was a big day. I found out you are you, a precious girl. I had tears of joy streaming down my face through the whole ultrasound. I love you so much already, all 5.5 inches of you. You were just busy as ever in there, moving so fast they had a tough time getting accurate measurements. I thought, oh yes, that’s definitely my girl. Bubba, your dad, said you have a Pemberton nose; that’s your grandmother’s family. I have been praying for you and will never stop. I’ve been praying about what kind of girl you are. I’ve been praying about our relationship. Been… 
 Mini Pies 
 Paige Dunn 22 Jun 2012 | 6:38 pm I have a new favorite toy! It is a mini pie maker—the size of a panini maker. This (new to me) machine has been so much fun to play with, I had to share with you all. I have to admit that baking is not something that comes easily to me. In fact, I usually mess up whatever I’m baking because of my need to be creative and lack of willingness to follow directions. For some reason, though, this pie maker works for me. I found a great mini pies recipe book, which has been wonderful for ideas. So far I have made strawberry (with fresh berries from my strawberry patch), mixed berry, spinach and…

 Shining a Light 
 Crystal 9 Jul 2012 | 5:08 am My 8 year old went to sleep with a flashlight. He’s never been afraid of the dark. He has a nightlight, but he’s never one to think monsters were hiding under his bed. Except something has changed. He still doesn’t fear monsters. That’s not what’s hiding in the shadows of his room. Instead, they’re miniature stickmen. Jumping from his toy chest and lunging towards him in galloping leaps. And of course, all of this had to happen at midnight.“I saw something”, Jedi whispered to me, coming in my room as I was just about to close my eyes after a…

 Guest Post: Clean Summer Eating 
 Mommy 10 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am With the warm summer months among us, barbecued sloppy Joes and hearty beach burgers can become regulars on the menu. Lazy summer days make it easy to skimp on the healthy foods and simply say, “I’ll add ‘eating healthy’ to my New Years Resolutions in 6 months.” However, with fresh seasonal foods making a debut this season, summer is the perfect time to eat clean—not only for yourself, but for your children, too! Take a look at the following healthy habits you should develop this summer. Feel free to print it, tape it to the fridge, and live by it! Healthy Habit #1: Portion…

 I #YOLO, do you? 
 Liz 9 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am The sweet, funny and incredibly-hip Empress first introduced me to the concept of #YOLO back in June. Then my uber-awesome biz partner, KLZ, wrote her very own #YOLO list last week. Now, if you live in TN, KY or NC, YoLo probably means a post-dinner frozen yogurt and gelato treat. But for those hip to the social scene, #YOLO means 1 thing and 1 thing only–You Only Live Once. This hashtagged acronym is seen accompanying tweets about (usually) stupid, immature, reckless, wild or gutsy behavior. While I’ve never been the stupid, immature, reckless nor wild type, I may be a bit… 
 The Things I’ll Do for Love (of PopChips) 
 Liz 4 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am What is a serial snacker to do when her absolutely most favorite ever, too-DIE-for snack is next to impossible to find in the store? Why, she orders a case of it from Amazon. Naturally. And then when she opens her glorious gifts from the UPS Gods, and takes her first, long-awaited bite? All becomes right again with the world. Now that’s a picture of true love if I’ve ever seen one. Chili lime PopChips, you complete me. -–-–-–- - {This post is also part of #iPPP} 
 How to Grow Tomatoes the Lazy Way 
 Liz 28 Jun 2012 | 4:00 am This week Mama Kat asked…Prompt 3.) Do you have a green thumb? Tell us what kind of gardener you are! I’ve attempted many a summer and style of gardening. I’ve had good success with Square Foot Gardening, but last year I decided to tone down my efforts, protect what I was growing from Jack, and move from 2 raised beds to a few containers housed within a gated section of our yard. We had some good output of cherry tomatoes, and the girls and I thoroughly enjoyed our much smaller and more manageable“garden”. At the end of last season, I was very late and very…

 Is Private Kindergarten Worth the Cost? 
 smilingdog 11 Jul 2012 | 12:43 pm Parents today are sending their children to private kindergartens in record numbers. While some of these parents can afford the tuition of private school, others are finding themselves taking out student loans to be able to foot the bill. The question then becomes: is private kindergarten worth the cost? Here are five advantages of taking [...]

 Summer Camp 2012 
 Epic Mom 10 Jul 2012 | 9:18 pm Well, we’re back from camp, and can I tell you we had a FABULOUS week!  The kiddies were rock stars, they weren’t at all bothered by the mosquitos or change in their schedule.  They made lots of new friends and Brie even got her hair done in a fish tail braid by one of the camp staff who was here all the way from Ireland! Hubby had a great time doing programming and I had a blast leading the skill I came up with this year–a daily newspaper and action news report.  Our overall message this week was about the fact that we are all remarkable!  I have to say, the teens and… 
 Awesome Hair Accessories Giveaway 
 Epic Mom 29 Jun 2012 | 7:52 pm Nancy, the owner of Frilly Girly hair accessories said that she never would have imagined during her pregnancy that her daughter would be born with a full head of hair! After her initial shock (it lasted no longer than 10 seconds!), she felt excited at the thought of her darling baby girl wearing hair accessories to match all the cute little outfits waiting for her at home. However, she found that it was nearly impossible to find stretchy headbands for newborns (who most of the time have only a small amount of hair), and even for toddlers or little girls. The ones she found were all the same…

 Seafood Week: Tuna Salad Sundae 
 Laura Keogh 12 Jul 2012 | 4:02 am We’re all well versed in the benefits of tuna, especially for their omega-3 content. It’s also a great source of lean protein. However, did you know it tastes great in an ice cream cup. Stay with me. I know you’re thinking,“This girl has lost her mind or just stuck it into the freezer too much looking for dessert this summer.”But, I’m telling you, it’s a great way to make lunch more fun. Oh, the things we do to keep meals interesting. Actually, Scarlett and I are fans of tuna so it’s not like we need a fancy gimmick. However, we do like to… 
 Chef Notes: The Salt Diaries 
 Amanda Digges 12 Jul 2012 | 4:01 am I love salt. I know it’s not good for you, particularly if you have high blood pressure, and it should be used judiciously and in moderation. However, it is the most important flavor enhancer on the planet–That is not to say that you cannot enjoy your food without it or find other ways of enhancing flavour. Yet there is no getting around the fact that it is the simplest way of seasoning. Unlike herbs and spices, salt doesn’t add flavor it enhances it. If you’ve added enough salt that it becomes a flavor, you’ve added too much.  This is, of course with a few exceptions, where… 
 Food Find: Whole Wheat English Muffins 
 Laura Keogh 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am I think it has been well established on this blog that I love anything that has to do with breakfast. I could actually start another blog devoted to breakfast but, unfortunately, I sleep from the hours of midnight to 6am so the only free time of my day is full. However, these english muffins would be the first posts on my breakfast blog. I tell you, it’s just non-stop reporting over here at SPC. The PC Blue Menu 100% Whole Wheat have all the spaces and crannies of those other muffins (I love those too) but I really like that the Blue Menu version are whole wheat. They’re also are…

 Let go of control (TV and sweets) 
 Marilia Di Cesare 10 Jul 2012 | 5:23 am A while ago, back in Costa Rica, Luísa had to avoid white sugar to get rid of a skin condition. It was the first time in my life I had to give up sugar as well (as I joined her needed sugar free diet) We started eating healthy cookies and my 5-year old was ok with it. We would skip the diet once in a while (probably a few times a week). Since then, we were still eating sweets out of the house, I just thought it was wise not to have it available in the house. Now that she can have sugar again, we´ve been having it almost daily again (when we are out). I was always saying no to sweet requests… 
 Why Madagascar 3 and other lovely cartoons are actually bad for your kid 
 Marilia Di Cesare 28 Jun 2012 | 8:57 am I spent 10 days with my family in São Paulo. Besides the bonding with my loved ones, there were some very negative aspects of our immersion in the big city. The most negative thing is the TV (protagonist thing in most living rooms). In my dad´s house, my 5-year old watched a lot of TV. One day, my girl was watching TV and my dad and his girlfriend invited us to go to see Madagascar 3 (3D) at the mall. I felt stressed inside. First it was my bad memories of being in a mall on a Saturday night, but also it was a lot of screen watching already that day and now we were off to the movies (her… 
 Can your child go against the social norm? 
 Marilia Di Cesare 20 Jun 2012 | 5:38 am I was in São Paulo, Brazil, where my family lives for 10 days. The very first day I got there, I went to the mall with my sister to look for a coat for my 5-year old. After trying out some clothes and shoes, it was time to go. My daughter didn´t want to put her shoes on, she wanted to be barefoot. I let her. My sister tells me horrified: ¨You are not going to let her walk barefoot here, she can´t!¨ ¨Why not? The floors here are almost cleaner than in my house¨. I hope she doesn´t step on something disgusting, I couldn´t see anything on that floor dangerous. Then my sister said: ¨If…

 Missing In Action 
 Elisa 10 Jul 2012 | 4:55 am It has been 9 days since my last post. Everything is ok, nobody is hurt, nothing bad happened…but I have had to face that I might be dealing with a bit of burnout. Not specifically blog-related, either. You might remember that not too long ago, my husband went on a trip and had to stay away for six weeks. Six weeks of doing it all, with both girls, including German homework, home stuff, small emergencies. Six weeks when I started out ok, then stumbled, then got up and kept going, but feeling a little bruised. By the end of the six weeks, I was exhausted, and frankly a little resentful… 
 Mood board: she’s got the blues

To make matters worse, there will be no trip to Sardinia (not any other coastal region) for me this summer – cue major beach withdrawal. How am I going to spend an entire summer without looking at the sea, I am not sure yet – I’ll probably be dreaming about the blue-green waters of the Mediterranean in no time at all and attempt an escape to some place more fitting to an island girl…For now, I’ll have to make do with some blue inspiration! I hope you have…

Here’s what I’ve learned: 1. Healthy food is the best ingredient in your beauty regimen: my skin has cleared and evened out more thanks to green smoothies than it ever did  by putting more time and effort (and money!) into my…

 Tonya Staab 7 Jul 2012 | 11:45 am Guess who finally got all of her photographs off her iPhone?   We had a busy, busy June.  A couple of highlights being the little ones graduating from Kindergarten, and the teen will be a Junior in the fall, and we officially started summer vacation. It&apos;s a lot of work keeping kids entertained over the long summer break.  We&apos;ve been doing an activity each day that will get them out of the house, and when they are at home, they are almost always in the swimming pool. Here&apos;s some of the fun we had in June.  We made organizers at a Home Depot Kids Workshop, we enjoyed family…

 Finish off the summer in cool seersucker looks 
 Courtney Strimel 11 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm When it&apos;s as hot as this record-breaking summer has been, staying cool trumps high fashion. Tank tops, cutoffs, flip-flops...as long as you&apos;re covered and it&apos;s cool, they all become fair game. As we begin the slow slide toward back-to-school, however, you may begin finding yourself invited to events (orientations, meetings) where your look needs to be more pulled together despite the heat. For times like these, seersucker is your friend. A classic lightweight, summery fabric, seersucker looks chic even with a wrinkle or two. Wear it to the office or out to an amusement park. Whatever…

 Christine Fox 10 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm July is national ice cream month and there&apos;s no better way to treat yourself during the summer than with this cold treat.

 Beautifully Designed Bilingual Board Books in Spanish/English 
 kellytirman 10 Jul 2012 | 3:14 pm I love finding new bilingual books for my daughters. Recently I picked up two sets of beautifully designed board books from Bilingual Readers. Tu Cuerpo contains two books about the human body. The other set, Sea Animals and Jungle Animals, also has two board books for your bilingual child. You will be willing to proudly display these books in your home because they are beautifully illustrated and designed, which is sometimes rare when it comes to bilingual books. Another bonus is that Bilingual Readers provides audio files on their website with pronunciation aids, which is perfect when you… 
 Friday iPhone Dump – Stinson Beach, California 
 kellytirman 6 Jul 2012 | 9:27 pm We just returned from a week in Stinson Beach. While I spend the next few days editing the photos I took with Nikon D300 here are several pictures I took and edited with my iPhone. Enjoy! I spent the good part of one day digging this HUGE“river”for the girls. They loved it. We all spent a lot of time drawing in the sand. After drawing Ivey’s name she proclaimed,“Hey, that’s my name. Daddy’s funny!”Linden laughed nonstop. She loved picking up the sand with her bare hands. Now that Linden is walking, the girls have started to actually play together.

 kellytirman 3 Jul 2012 | 9:17 pm Employee behavior is a big reflection of your business.

 Review of PenPalKidsClub.com 
 10 Jul 2012 | 6:51 pm My daughter has always wanted a pen pal... OK, maybe I&apos;ve always wanted her to have a pen pal; I have so many fond memories (and shoe boxes full of letters) from my childhood pen pals growing up. I had a handful in Australia, and getting letters from them were the highlight of a boring week on the farm. Today, kids aren&apos;t as into pen pals as they used to be; everything is online, which can be OK, provided it&apos;s done safely. PenPal Kids Club is a new website designed to give children the experience of having pen pals to converse with… 
 Mac-and-cheese Stuffed Peppers 
 10 Jul 2012 | 8:45 am Do you have an obscenely large stack of recipe books in your cupboard? Are you a hoarder of &quot;clippings&quot; from magazines with extravagant food ideas you&apos;ll likely never use? I am guilty of both of these practices, and yet, I still end up making the same old recipes! Yesterday, I surprised my family with a new recipe that I though they&apos;d enjoy. It was Macaroni and Cheese Stuffed Peppers, and I got the recipe from the Walmart Meal Solutions app on Facebook! The premise was simple: using four ingredients: Kraft Homestyle Macaroni and Cheese, green peppers, Oscar Meyer Fully…

 Guess who is a K-Cup® Ambassador? 
 Henrietta 11 Jul 2012 | 1:28 pm When I first started writing new product reviews on my blog so long ago, one of my first goals was to someday review a Keurig coffee brewer. It seemed like only the big blogs had a chance to review something as cool as a Keurig! As the years have gone by (it’s been almost four!), I put thoughts of owning a Keurig at the back of the shelf.  Can you imagine how surprised and excited I was when I was contacted last week…about reviewing a Keurig! More specifically, I was asked to be a K-Cup® Ambassador for Keurig® brewers and the Green Mountain Coffee® family of brands.  That…

 Pali Baby and Children Furniture: Torino Crib 
 AndreaM 12 Jul 2012 | 6:27 am With the due date of my third child rapidly approaching, to say the least my nesting instinct in in full force.  I have been searching for months (literally since I knew I was pregnant) for the perfect crib for this baby and I found it in Pali. Four generations of our family have been making furniture: 100 years ago our workshop made everything by hand. It now features the most modern technology. The same priceless experience we have obtained over the years by producing chairs we now apply to making cribs and dressers. Pali has become a leader in the industry, noted for our ability to be… 
 New Snapfish 11×14 Lay-Flat Photo Book 
 AndreaM 12 Jul 2012 | 4:44 am I love taking pictures of the kids but am not a big fan of having pictures of myself taken.  Sound familiar?  Well my husband has been wanting to take family pictures for a while now and I just kept putting it off, especially since I am so pregnant.  To my surprise (and yes I will admit it a little irritation too) my husband set up a family photo shoot in the outdoors with a local photographer.  I don’t know why I didn’t have the photos completed sooner since they are amazing.  When Snapfish asked if I would like to review their new Snapfish 11×14 Lay-Flat Photo Book I…

It was a really fun afternoon and I’d love to go back sometime {but not when it’s 110 degrees like it is now.} Anyways, I’m writing this post now because I came across a business card I had taken at the Market while cleaning out the kitchen desk. {Do you have a desk in your kitchen?

 Backyard Bird Watching Western Tanager 
 Erica 10 Jul 2012 | 7:05 am I saw a bird with a red head on our chain link fence yesterday. I though it was a confused woodpecker at first. We had one of those at our old house. It was a female that liked to rap on the metal chimney caps at an unreasonably early time of the morning. Stupid bird. When this bird turned I saw that the body was bright yellow and I ran for my camera. It stayed on the fence the until I returned and turned the camera on then it promptly flew off. Thankfully it didn’t go too far, because I wouldn’t be able to identify this little guy without a photo and the interwebs. This… 
 A Week of Food Firsts 
 Erica 9 Jul 2012 | 7:48 am The morning started with pancakes in the park. Lukas had of course had pancakes before and he had strawberries before just never the two together and in the park. Lukas insisted on having the strawberry soaked pieces – to the point of eating around the dry parts. The absolute opposite of his sister who had her pancakes without strawberries. In the afternoon we couldn’t get the boy to stop running into the street or to not whine in his stroller so during the 4th of July parade I gave him his first ever hard candy followed by popcorn. We had given Lukas popcorn before when he was about…

 Another Anti-Spanking Rant 
 ELiles 4 Jul 2012 | 10:15 am &quot;The claim that mild punishments (slaps or smacks) have no detrimental effect is still widespread because we received this message very early from our parents who had taken it over from their parents. Unfortunately, the main damage it causes is precisely the broad dissemination of this conviction. The result is that each successive generation is subjected to the tragic effects of so-called &apos;physical correction.&apos; ... Physical cruelty and emotional humiliation not only leave their marks on children, they also inflict a disastrous imprint on the future of our society. Information on the effects…

It&apos;s all part of the same thing.&apos;... I says, &apos;What&apos;s this call, this spirit?&apos; An&apos; I says, &apos;It&apos;s love.

 6 Ways to Talk to Your Husband About Your Business (Without Getting Into A Fight) 
 Guest 1 Jul 2012 | 12:04 pm Does pursuing your business dreams give rise to nightmare conversations with your husband? Many mom entrepreneurs find that their business becomes a sore subject. At best, we wind up feeling vaguely unsupported, scrutinized, or misunderstood. At worst, we get in narsty fights with the guy we love the most. All because of this business we’re pouring our hearts into so we can express our gifts and support our families, right? I’m here to reassure you. I coach women on these issues all the time, and seldom do their worst fears turn out to be true. Fears like:“He really…

But she’s not my only motivation. I want to take care of my husband, mother, sister, in-laws, nieces and nephew as well. I also want to take care of my community at large specifically by investing in education in predominately minority neighborhoods and women entrepreneurs in the U.S. and abroad. It turns out that I am not alone. More often than not, when a woman creates a successful business, her entire community benefits. This is because… 
 Why You’re Not Taking A Summer Break 
 Charlie Gilkey 27 Jun 2012 | 11:27 am A bunch of reasons just popped into your head from that headline. You don’t have the money, you don’t have the time, you don’t need to, you’re taking a sorta-break, you don’t have anyone to take care of your business while you’re out and so on. All might be true to some degree or the other, but the real truth is that you’re not taking a summer break because you haven’t given yourself permission to do so. Without the permission, there’s no commitment, and commitment is one of the necessary pieces to actually getting anything done, even when…

 Fun was had by all 
 Melissa 7 Jul 2012 | 8:01 pm It’s hard to know what to do with a vacation sometimes. Should you plan lots of fun activities that you wouldn’t normally get to do? Should you relax? Should you work on projects? As usual, we ended up doing a little bit of it all. Relaxing, working and playing. It was hot, hot, hot, so we did a little swimming. Took a little trip to the river to explore, and we even went to the theater to see a movie (a rare event). We saw Brave and loved it. I got new running shoes and have been breaking them in this week. I can run a full 3 minutes now without stopping. It seems pitifully minor…

We had the opportunity to go to a huge field of sunflowers, but it was so darn hot! We almost withered away. I had to buy a good bit of ice cream afterwards for rewards and cooling off. We took Hazel. I wanted a really good picture of my kids with the dog, and I think I got what I wanted. She only vomited once. I always manage to get car sick dogs. I gave her a bath before hand and tied the pretty blue bandana around her neck. She was looking cute. She did great too. Ya’ll tonight…

 Will the Real Welfare Queens Please Stand Up 
 Rich Single Momma 11 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I saw this on Facebook yesterday and had to post it. This is likely going to cause a lot of controversy but I am beyond caring at this point. All my life I’ve heard the complaints of the so-called Patriots of America and listened to them spew their venom out on the poor. They claimed the welfare moms, mostly single moms, were living off the system and getting free handouts. They complained about welfare programs and consistently try to pass legislation that will greatly reduce or end programs for the poor. There has been a campaign to further denigrate widows (single moms), orphans, and… 
 [Video] Single Mom Depression, Anxiety and Stress Relief Naturally 
 Rich Single Momma 9 Jul 2012 | 12:49 pm Depression and single motherhood seem to go hand in hand, am I right? I lived with depression, anxiety, and stress for a lot of years. Sometimes I still feel stress but I think that’s part of life. But when it gets to severe levels it becomes a problem and affect your quality of life. I won’t go into all the reason why we experience depression but I have learned there are ways to get better without medicine and years of expensive therapy. I’ve used both methods to treat my symptoms but they did not give me lasting relief because they weren’t right for me. You may have…

 I First Held Her 8 Years Ago 
 Danielle 10 Jul 2012 | 11:58 pm Tonight, during bedtime prayers, my husband told my small people that I was the bravest person they might ever know.  At 6 and 8, they blindly believe him.  Eyes wide, heads nodding.  They know the outline of my story, but not the details. Eight years ago at this very moment, I was in a hospital room, waking from anesthesia, having become a mom only a few short hours earlier.  My surgery was sudden.  It was unexpected.  It was terrifying. When they took me away I had only held my sweet girl one time–for less than two minutes.  And I was violently ill from the pain.  When they…

 What to do When Honey Crystalizes 
 iDreamOfClean 11 Jul 2012 | 5:14 am I buy honey by the gallon. It’s real food. It’s natural. And it’s goooood. Buying honey in bulk from a beekeeper is less expensive than buying from the grocery store. However, a gallon of honey is just a tad–ahem - more expensive than a gallon of white sugar. I’m trying to be a good steward of our resources while also feeding my family healthy, whole foods, so I do my best to get every last drop out of that honey jar! The problem with buying in bulk is that raw honey tends to crystalize faster than honey from a grocery store. Now I know crystallization is a… 
 Does Your Home Smell and You Don’t Even Know It? 
 iDreamOfClean 10 Jul 2012 | 9:03 am Your home has a unique smell. So does mine. But since we each spend a good amount of time in our own homes, we’ve become accustomed to the way it smells. Is almost impossible to tell if our own home smells good, has an odor, or is even noticeable at all. If you don’t believe me, go to your grandmother’s house. Go visit your cousin. Stop by a friends house you haven’t seen in a couple of years. You’ll notice! But can you find out how your own home smells? Thankfully, the answer is yes! You can ask a trusted friend. Ask your friend if they can tell your beloved… 
 Quick Serve Watermelon: A No Mess Solution 
 iDreamOfClean 3 Jul 2012 | 8:20 am I’m personally not a fan of cutting up watermelon in triangles, letting half of it get mushy sitting in its juice, and letting the other half rot. If I’m 100% sure the entire thing will be eaten, then maybe. But if there’s a chance for leftover fruit, then I try to avoid it. I recently showed you how I serve watermelon by cutting it like a pumpkin. It’s my favorite way to eat this summer fruit at home; mostly it takes less than a minute to prepare, but also because I don’t have to dirty any dishes in the process. Anything to spend less time cleaning the…

So far, with a family history of Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis, I suspect my body is doing the same with some sort of inflammatory… 
 Sunday&apos;s Sundaes: Continuing a Love Affair&amp;$100 Visa Giveaway 
 Scout&apos;s Honor 28 Jun 2012 | 1:52 pm Those of you who have been with me a while know about my family&apos;s secret. Yes, it&apos;s a naughty, secret addiction...ice cream and frozen dairy desserts! LOTS and lots of it! Yep, it started early with my husband&apos;s first job, which crazy-spoiled us with the ability to bring home ice cream, fresh off the line. Our love of the dessert has never, ever abated--even after he went on to a less exciting (read no more ice cream) career path. Fast forward to today, and we, the Scouty family, still cling to our long-standing love affair with creamy, dreamy desserts... ...and now a tradition of… 
 On Marriage, Motherhood, and Caffeine: I&apos;m Not Worthy 
 Scout&apos;s Honor 15 Jun 2012 | 11:49 am Believe me: I know I am spoiled! My husband brings me coffee everyday. EVERYDAY. Usually before I am up and out of bed. It&apos;s just his thing he loves to do for me. ...Or perhaps he knows his chances of a level-minded wife increase with caffeine. This last week, he got up at 4 AM more than once to take the kids to their morning swim practice and still managed to bring me that blessed steaming coffee. Today however? Today, while the coffee was ground and brewed on timer, he arrived home from practice--only to turn around quickly to grab an earlier van pool. He was…

I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s because I&apos;ve been running my brains out or if I have just been on a cloud still! I had such an awesome time, not just being on the Kathie Lee and Hoda show but also being in NYC with my little ole country momma. I was a bit worried for her since she LOVES to talk to EVERYONE (lol) but I&apos;m proud of her.  I told her &apos;mom, this is NYC-you can&apos;t be your southern-talk to everyone self. It&apos;s NOT Kansas anymore mom!&apos; Her response:…

 Will the Real Welfare Queens Please Stand Up 
 Rich Single Momma 11 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I saw this on Facebook yesterday and had to post it. This is likely going to cause a lot of controversy but I am beyond caring at this point. All my life I’ve heard the complaints of the so-called Patriots of America and listened to them spew their venom out on the poor. They claimed the welfare moms, mostly single moms, were living off the system and getting free handouts. They complained about welfare programs and consistently try to pass legislation that will greatly reduce or end programs for the poor. There has been a campaign to further denigrate widows (single moms), orphans, and…

Sometimes I still feel stress but I think that’s part of life. But when it gets to severe levels it becomes a problem and affect your quality of life. I won’t go into all the reason why we experience depression but I have learned there are ways to get better without medicine and years of expensive therapy. I’ve used both methods to treat my symptoms but they did not give me lasting relief because they weren’t right for me. You may have…

 Little pick-me-ups 
 Judy Schwartz Haley 3 Jul 2012 | 6:03 pm A friend once said to me“Enough with the character building; we’ve got plenty of character.”And I do believe I have plenty of character, yet life keeps the lessons coming at me. One of those lessons is that I need to make a practice of taking care of myself, and I’m not just talking about the physical parts (exercising more, and eating less garbage), although that is an element. I’m talking about taking care of the rest of me–the parts that make me me. Most of the time, I can rattle off 5 or 15 things that I love to do and I know will lift my spirits.

It’s not that I’m faced with the reality of that quote on a daily basis, but it does remind me that while the lingering effects of my cancer still impact every single day of my life, many around me have moved on; my cancer is old news and in their minds, overplayed. I understand this perspective; I’ve been…

You should maybe rethink that strategy. Personally, I have a brother the size of a bouncer and a dog that’s meaner than a lactating wild boar guarding the crib when [...]

 For Kids: Bread Recipe You Can Shape Into Animals (And Other Things) 
 La Jolla Mom 11 Jul 2012 | 7:21 am I have a thing about food shaped like animals, especially during summer when I know such creations can keep La Jolla Girl busy. Though I’ve always been a fan of AllRecipes, I’ve started using it more now that I have a shiny, new Windows Phone. I popped“animal food”into search and this darling bread recipe popped up. Within a few minutes we were baking bread: surprisingly good bread, too. So, his back is a little cracked but this recipe is a keeper, because it took us just a few minutes to make, you can mold it into different shapes, or hollow it out for the cutest… 
 It’s The Party Of The Year – Be There 
 La Jolla Mom 10 Jul 2012 | 8:32 pm I keep the Best of San Diego issue of San Diego Magazine on the coffee table and refer to it year-round. I enjoy reading about the local businesses and people who have been recognized as outstanding in their respective categories. San Diego Magazine is part of how I keep track of who is doing what around town. Love it. The chance to celebrate the Best of San Diego issue is on August 17. Just look at the photo above–you want to be a part of that, don’t you? Well, you can. Visit San Diego Magazine and enter the code“LJMOM”at checkout to receive $10 off each of your… 
 6 At Home Olive Oil-based Beauty Remedies 
 La Jolla Mom 9 Jul 2012 | 7:02 am Kids keep us on our toes and sometimes prevent us from hitting the spa or gym as frequently as we’d like. So, that leaves squeezing in a little“me time”at home. Rather than spend another dime on a mediocre hand cream, have a look in your pantry. Olive oil is a natural way to treat many beauty-related issues. I started on an olive oil kick after a visit to my favorite non-toxic nail place, Bellemani Salon here in La Jolla. I opted for a rare manicure in addition to my pedicure because I was showing items on TV the following day. Like other moms, I fight dry hands due to…

 Our last playgroup

For the past week, every time I’ve thought about it, I’ve felt myself welling up. For two years it has been the special activity that we [...] 
 There’s a new Disney Princess in town! 
 Wendy McAuliffe 2 Jul 2012 | 2:00 pm When it comes to the nature versus nurture debate, there is one thing that is 100 per cent ‘nature’ with girls…and that’s their obsession with princesses. Where does it come from? The whole princess and fairytale thing really fascinates me, particularly since it reinforces all of those female stereotypes that we probably don’t encourage as [...]

 Sedona trip | Pink Jeep Scenic Rim + Broken Arrow Tour 
 sarah 12 Jul 2012 | 5:31 am On the last day of our trip, we took the Pink Jeep combination Scenic Rim and Broken Arrow tour. We rode in these crazy–yes, pink–jeeps with tires like I’ve never seen. The first part of the trip took us around the scenic rock formations.  Our awesome guide, John, is an Arizona native, so he gave us the deep background on everything Sedona.  I asked approximately 598,196 questions, and he probably regrets telling me he is from the area. That’s Smooch Rock.  So cute, no? After the Scenic Rim, we moved onto the Broken Arrow Tour.  Pink Jeeps are the only… 
 Big girl bed 
 sarah 11 Jul 2012 | 5:24 am Over the weekend we converted Kate’s crib into a big girl bed. Everything seemed to be going alright. Until yesterday. When she decided she was no longer going to nap. And wailed for an hour. For an hour she yelled, cried, screamed, got up to open and slam her door shut, whine for me, and throw herself on the mattress, kicking and screaming. I sat in my office, banging my head against my computer desk. Yesterday was a no-break day.  And today I’m getting anxious about what will go down tihs afternoon.  It’s a toddler battle of wills.  And I’m thinking I’m… 
 Sedona trip | Out of Africa Wildlife Park 
 sarah 10 Jul 2012 | 5:46 am I’m sure Dan thought I was going to leave him and stay to work at Out of Africa. I love this place.  I didn’t want to leave. Out of Africa offers a free-with-your-admission tour around some parts of the park.  But we opted to take the VIP tour to get more of a behind-the-scenes look inside the park. We hemmed and hawed about that VIP ticket, but I’m glad we did because we got up close and personal with several animals.  Some more than others. The giraffes were my favorite.  They are friendly, sweet, and all about treats.  Obviously we got along famously.  Our tour…

 5 Ideas to Make the Fourth of July Holiday Even More Fun 
 Sue Kirchner 29 Jun 2012 | 3:06 pm The Fourth of July is the pinnacle event of the summer. You usually get a few days off and this Holiday always seems to really drive home the fact that summer is in full swing. BBQs. Picnics. Family Reunions. The local parades and the firework shows are always a good time. But after you’ve done the typical Fourth of July activities, you still have a day or two off to have some fun with the family. This year the Fourth of July falls on a Wednesday and it’s messing with everyone’s schedule. Do you celebrate this weekend? Next weekend? Which days do you get off of work? 
 Fabulous Father’s Day Gifts to Make with the Kids 
 Sue Kirchner 14 Jun 2012 | 2:58 pm Search for homemade Father’s Day gifts on Pinterest and you’ll be amazed at all of the options. There is everything from super simple to incredibly elaborate. I wanted to find a few ideas for gifts that I could definitely make with the kids but that still had a lot of“Wow”factor. Here were a few of my favorite ideas, however I pinned quite a few more on my All About Dad Pinterest Board, if you’re looking for more inspiration. 1. I loved these Father’s Day Necktie Goodie Bags from LittleFamilyFun.com. The kids want to fill ours with plenty of chocolate for… 
 Very Pinteresting Father’s Day Cards 
 Sue Kirchner 14 Jun 2012 | 9:51 am I was on Pinterest last night (shock!) and fell in love with some of these really creative Father’s Day cards that you can make with the kids. Some are easy, some are a little more involved but all of these ideas will thrill Dad on his special day. Download and print this Father’s Day card and coupon set from Amy at LivingLocurto.com. The download is $3.95 but that’s how much I paid for a Father’s Day card at the store, which didn’t include the fun coupons. I would certainly ask the kids for a few more ideas and add some of our own coupons, as well. I adore the…

 The Wink 
 
 Here’s Why 
 amandamagee 10 Jul 2012 | 11:30 am I planted a garden because it brings me disproportionate joy. Watering the plants is my worship. The smell of the water from the garden hose, the way my thumb shakes with exertion from making the water spray wide, to the way the cold droplets play rat a tat tat on my feet. I lose myself in the unhurried caretaking of the plants that will contribute to feeding my family. I take my morning coffee outside and tiptoe to the mini garden at the foot of the deck and squeal,“OhmygoshIgrewanhonesttogoodnesscucumber!”I run breathlessly upstairs to Sean brandishing the cucumber.“Do… 
 Laboring Love 
 amandamagee 8 Jul 2012 | 7:41 am Labor of love is kind of a tired phrase, isn’t it? I’m guilty of doing that thing where you use incredibly descriptive words to assign more importance and depth to a thing, sometimes more for my own benefit than for those that I am talking to. Maybe I put the girls off to finish drafting copy, or I bag going to the gym or getting my hair done in order to do something else. The guilt will gnaw at me so I construct a scenario where what I have done was worth the things I sacrificed. I’m getting smarter. I am saying no more, making myself acknowledge when something is getting… 
 Bending to Gratitude 
 amandamagee 4 Jul 2012 | 9:40 am Less than two years ago I was learning that living is not a promise. A year ago I was discovering that how I feel (and look) is all up to me. This year I am sitting with my girls reflecting on how very lucky we all are. We have so much on account of the things people before us have done. The things we are doing today may very well influence the life of someone who will come after us. I am choosing to give my gratitude space to live in the decisions I make. Kindness, empathy, generosity. Calm time with my family, driven action at work and a willingness to keep an open mind in each moment.

 Today is the day... 
 GJT 7 Jul 2012 | 5:28 pm Today we leave Colorado and head East. Today we say goodbye to a fantastic city that has served us well, in search of new adventures. Denver&apos;s been good to us. Columbus, what you got??? Today we opt not to say Goodbye, but rather See Ya Later to all of wonderful friends, holding on to hope that through phone, email, Facebook and Facetime, we can stay in touch. Today we take a leap. Though I wish we could step foot on that plane holding hands à la Thelma and Louise, we can&apos;t squeeze through the doorway like that. We&apos;ll be doing so in spirit. Taking… 
 Gypsy... 
 GJT 3 Jul 2012 | 5:27 am I&apos;m sure it really didn&apos;t happen this way, but it&apos;s how I remember it. 8th grade. Coming home from cheerleader tryouts, a ginormous grin on my face from having been chosen to join the squad, getting to finally cheer alongside all of my friends. Ecstatic even. Then hearing the bombshell my parents dropped in my lap... We were moving. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything my parents could have said to make me feel any better. We were moving from New Orleans, my birthplace, the only town I&apos;d ever known, where all my friends and family were. By the end of that… 
 A stay at the Madhouse... 
 GJT 30 Jun 2012 | 9:55 am Ever since I can remember, I&apos;ve loved to laugh. Humor is one of the best things on the planet. That quality is what attracted me to my funny husband, it&apos;s what drives most of my friendships, and it&apos;s what makes my kids tick. The more outlandish, the better.  You know that moment when you&apos;re laughing so hard your belly hurts and you&apos;re a kegel away from peeing yourself? Best. Moment. Ever. I love those. When I&apos;m having a crappy day, when I feel like my kids might be driving the bus I&apos;m taking to the insane asylum, there&apos;s a blog I can retreat to where I…

 Don’t Leave Me, Sweet Baby Talk! 
 11 Jul 2012 | 11:54 pm I don’t want Monkey’s baby talk to go away. Is that so terrible? But every day his vocabulary grows. Every day he has a whole new sentence or thought to communicate to me. Every day he has a new expression that keeps me wondering, “where the heck did he learn that?!” His growing up makes me so super sad. Pretty soon I’m not gonna be the Number One Girl in his life, as I’m sure the moment his beautiful, lilting baby talk melts away, girlfriends and marriage are right around the corner. Which, in turn, means he’s moving away and calling his mom once every other month. And I’ll…

They ran around the empty rooms and played on the swing set. I checked drawers and cabinets….again. I left a note for the new owners to let them know their trash pick up day, how to work the thermostat, etc. I walked around and remembered so many things. Singing a million lullabies to Half Caff. … 
 Paleo Dentistry&amp;Paleo Autoimmune Protocol Update

As for the cracked teeth:  I’ve been oil pulling with coconut oil, taking cod liver oil (regular CLO until yesterday when my fermented cod liver oil/butter oil arrived), eating a grain free diet, and avoiding processed sugar completely.  With all that, imagine my surprise…

Here’s a quick picture that he took of me loaded down with all the things I needed to stay up all night to cheer for him.  Next time he does a race like this, I’m going to buy a tent. As you can tell from my shiny self, it was hot out there. Still well over 80…

A bigger post on that will come soon, when I have the time and capacity to write it–but in the meantime, I couldn’t help but share a pretty funny moment from my dear Avery this morning. She’s now four and a half and one thing I love about her is her logic–the way she thinks about things and presents them often seems far beyond her years, and sometimes reminds me of how I approach things. Except for when she does… 
 gasp :: top baby names 
 Missy 5 Jun 2012 | 9:19 am Yesterday I saw Most popular baby names in Minnesota, 2011 by Jeremy Olson at the Star Tribune. It listed out the top 25 baby names for boys in girls nationally and in my great state of Minnesota. I literally gasped. My daughter Avery’s name listed at #17 for popular names last year in Minnesota. Wow! When I was looking for baby names, I had NEVER heard the name Avery before. I found it in a baby naming book and fell in love with it. Everyone I shared it with told me how unusual and pretty it was. I learned it was a name that could be used for both males and females. And… 
 assembly line:: school lunch sandwiches 
 Missy 28 May 2012 | 7:48 pm Tonight I was making lunch for my son, a Sunbutter and jelly sandwich, and the thought hit me that I should make more than one at once and freeze them! Why did it take me all school year to finally figure this out? Ha! Granted, I only make them 1-2 days a week, and fill out his lunch menu with other meats and proteins…but still. This saves quite a bit of time from having to pull out the various ingredients each time, using one knife instead of 6, you get the picture.. Now you may be thinking,“Hey, these look like those Uncrustables…”Um, yeah–they do, they…

First up was a little something for my daughter. She diligently saved money from chores and birthday to get herself an iPod Touch. I was so proud of her accomplishment because she is usually spending it before she has it. However she is a little rough and tough sometimes so I didn’t want her to break it in the first day. We caroused around the Otterbox selection and she finally decided on this little beauty:…

 International Delight Recipe Creation #IcedDelight 
 Lizzy 2 Jul 2012 | 4:56 pm I recently went shopping at Sam’s Club to find International Delight Iced Coffee to participate in a recipe creation. I was extremely excited to not only try out the iced coffee, but to get creative in the kitchen. I love to come up with new recipes and so this is right up my alley. Not only is the International Delights Iced Coffee yummy, but it is quite a bit more affordable then heading out to a coffee shop daily to buy an iced mocha. At .40 per serving, you can’t go wrong with buying International Delight Iced Coffee. I decided to try out a spin on the classic no bake cookie…

My next favorite find was actually an accidental… 
 Tyson Mini Chicken Sandwiches, Quick and Delicious 
 Lizzy 28 Nov 2011 | 10:27 am Since this past week was somewhat hectic and busy, I depended greatly upon quick and easy meals and snacks for my children.  My kiddos were out of school for the entire week so I knew I’d need to stock up on something that would be tasty and easy to make as well.  Tyson Mini Chicken sandwiches seemed to fit that description exactly.   With plenty of cooking and cleaning to be done, I had to rely upon Tyson Mini Chicken Sandwiches to keep my children satisfied.  We came up with a few varieties of sandwich options that helped make for a great snack and/or meal.  We added scrambled…

 Michelle 9 Jul 2012 | 2:53 am I forced the boys to stop at Hobby Lobby one day when we were out and they were both acting like sullen teenagers being dragged through the girlie craft store. And then, from afar, the Davester spotted it. SPACE FOOD. I am not a boy. I know, you’re shocked. Dave, on the other hand, was one… a long, long time ago. So, there are lots of cool BOY things that I didn’t do as a kid. Freeze dried astronaut food is one of them. They were both beside themselves with excitement. We waited until Tate was tucked into bed and the two of them tore into the package and started…

 It’s the Goddess of America! 
 mariak1 4 Jul 2012 | 7:07 am In the early 1960s, my father came to the US from Greece, in search of his own American dream. When I was growing up, my dad regaled us with stories about coming to America. Fast forward to 2006, when on a boat in New York harbor, gazing at the Statue of Liberty, I recalled the story and shared it with my husband, garnering laughter from all around us. Here it is, with a reminder to keep family history alive. Your children should know where they come from. I hope you enjoy!

 Five Year-old Explains How the World was Created

Mom: Tell me. Boo: There was a very special girl in Heaven. Her name was Mary. God decided that she was special enough to be the mother of His son. So they got married. Mom: They got married? Boo: Let me finish! So they got married, and then the angel came to tell Mary she’d have a baby boy and she was supposed to name him Jesus. Mom: Gabriel? Boo: Good, Mommy. Soon after, Mary gave birth to Jesus, and she became Panayia (most… 
 Do Not Ask Me Again if I’m Going to Have Another Child! 
 mariak1 28 May 2012 | 6:36 am Last year, I wrote a piece that appeared on Harlots Sauce Radio, called “You Did Not Just Say That!” about what not to say to someone who recently experienced a miscarriage. Since then, I have been bombarded with questions – and from people who know better – asking when #3 is coming. When I tell them that I’m not so young anymore – I’m 42… Then they respond with examples of 57 women who had kids at the age of 46. Then I remind them that I lost #3 – it turned out to be a molar pregnancy, with many complications, and required chemotherapy – they still insist that I must have…

 Powering Up Summer with Omega-3 Water 
 Barb W. 11 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I&apos;m a huge fan of Omega 3&apos;s. From first-hand experience taking Omega 3 supplements (Fish Oil) and eating Omega-3 rich foods has had a very positive impact on keeping my cholesterol numbers low. It&apos;s a regular staple in my diet that&apos;s here to stay.

 Barb W. 10 Jul 2012 | 8:50 pm One of the films I&apos;m excited to see this summer is The Odd Life of Timothy Green. Disney, once again, brings a magical story to the screen that looks like a guaranteed heart-warmer full of intrigue and enchantment. The Odd Life of Timothy Green is an inspiring story about a happily married couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton), who can’t wait to start a family but can only dream about what their child would be like. When young Timothy (CJ Adams) shows up on their doorstep one stormy night, Cindy and Jim—and their small town of Stanleyville—learn… 
 Bona Hardwood Floor Motion Mop Review (and a Giveaway!) 
 Barb W. 10 Jul 2012 | 12:48 pm Normally, I&apos;d first give you a run down on features of a product, but I feel compelled to cut to the chase immediately here, because you just gotta love a product that motivates your children to help clean your hard wood floors! The features of the Bona Hardwood Floor Motion Mop are remarkable, but I can’t help but be most ecstatic about how easy and fun this product is to use that even my children can’t resist wanting to use it. That, my Rural Mom friends, is magical! The folks at Bona have been providing quality floor care for over ninety years, and the Hardwood Floor Motion Mop is…

 Under Construction: A Swing Set 
 Athalia Jane 8 Jul 2012 | 10:17 pm We were given a swing set last year, a beautiful wooden one with a slide and two swings and a kids&apos; sized picnic table. The slide was affixed to our porch. The picnic table hosts sandy tea parties and clover-spaghetti dinners made-from-scratch in the nearby sand &quot;pot.&quot; Those swings were dropped, chains and all, into a five-gallon bucket and pushed into a dark corner of our dusty shed. I have big plans to spit-shine that shed into a respectable condition, and Mountain Man has big plans for a family-sized swing set. He took a week of vacation this past week in order to start its… 
 Farm Notions and Other Such Nonsense 
 Athalia Jane 21 Jun 2012 | 4:05 am If you were a literate fly on a wall and happened to buzz around the room for a while before landing on a computer and then another, you might have read an exchange like the one below this evening:  Farm notions to he So, here&apos;s my thoughts so far - I like the idea of a goat dairy. Seems that [our goat friends] think having a cow to follow behind in a pasture rotation would help goats. I know that having chickens follow behind cows in a pasture rotation helps cows. And I like eating turkey. Hogs can eat the whey leftover from cheese-making, so that makes a well rounded farm with… 
 Sleep, any way we can get it. 
 Athalia Jane 20 Jun 2012 | 7:54 pm So, I should probably explain where I have been and what we have been up to and why it has been so long since I have written our daily happenings and my musings. There are certainly things to be said about that, as I have my reasons, and I should like to say more about them. Perhaps I will. Right now, however, I&apos;d like to just pick up where I left off, like old friends do. Mountain Man and I were talking last night, as we are apt to do. He has words, and I have ears. It is a pleasing arrangement. He was telling me how much it meant to him to have our gal finish her dinner and ask, &quot;Can I go…

 The Overwhelming Responsibilities of a Single Parent 
 Marcelina Hardy 12 Jul 2012 | 5:23 am As a single parent, you know how incredibly hard it is some days. You have to juggle your career, house, and children. And just like a juggling act, sometimes everything comes crashing to the floor.It’s overwhelming. That is for sure.Everyone always talks about how you need to time to yourself, but how in the world will you ever be able to do that when you don’t have anyone willing to watch your children? And if they are willing to care for your children, they want to charge you an arm and a leg, which makes time to yourself less than worth it.People always say how great you are doing as…

 Breakfast with Bambi… 
 Jennifer 3 Jul 2012 | 9:19 am I snapped this shot this morning looking out from my bedroom door.  This deer was eating, while casually peering up at us.  This is a completely normal occurrence out here in the rural pacific northwest.  The deer seem to really love this area, and have made themselves right at home in our yard.  It is so fun to see the wild life!

 Be a Motivational Woman and Not a Jealous One 
 Jennifer 28 Jun 2012 | 9:29 am In the competitive world it can be easy to go in the wrong direction. Sure, you have to rise above others in order to make your way in your career, but there is a certain way to go about doing it. Just think about the ways in which you went about getting to where you are today and think about how that information can benefit the younger generation. If you look at a woman like Tyra Banks it can be clear to see how she made a name for herself and constantly made it her goal to spread the word. About 15 years ago it was not as easy as it is not to get the word out there she put her best foot…

 Banking Fees for Overdrafts when Not OverDrawn? Goodbye Old National Bank 
 Katrina Moody 9 Jul 2012 | 11:10 am We’re Saying GoodBye to Old National Bank over Unfair Banking Fees Charged OverDraft Fees When Not OverDrawn for the Last Time Jim and I have grown tired of paying Old National Bank exorbitant and unfair banking fees for overdrafts that never occur. Or maybe they think we should pay banking fees just for the pleasure of being our bank? At least 6 times over the last year we had a negative balance in our account not because of charges that actually went through our account, but because of hundreds of dollars worth of overdraft fees. Enough’s enough. It’s not fair, and…

 I’m me and you’re you or how to confuse a Tinkerous Toddler 
 mother.wife.me 11 Jul 2012 | 12:10 am “I’m me and you’re you”, said the Tinkerous Toddler as she pointed first to herself and then to me.“Yes”, I said.“I’m me and you’re you”. Pointing firstly to myself and then to TT. This went on for a few rounds, with TT becoming increasingly impatient, as she inserted an emphatic“no”before her turn.“No! I’m me and you’re you”. Finally. Exasperated, frustrated and thoroughly miffed with me, she exclaimed:“No mummy! Only little girls can be princesses”. Well, that told me. 
 Teenage Kicks: Problem and Solution 
 mother.wife.me 9 Jul 2012 | 12:00 am I had a midnight run-in with three teenage girls last week. I’d guess were they were 15, 16 at a push. Young enough for me to wonder whether their parents knew, or cared, where they were. Curiosity got the better of me after half an hour of being treated to their loud, studiously ‘stweet,’ chatter right outside our house. As I looked out of the window to put faces to voices, curiosity turned to annoyance. One of the girls was slouching on our car whilst she drew on it with her finger. Not a major crime I admit, but coupled with their lack of consideration on the noise front, it bugged…

 Bullying Between Teen Couples 
 Silly Mummy 11 Jul 2012 | 3:45 pm {image source} Now that I’m using public transport more often and spending time out and about with my son, I tend to witness weird things, funny things, shocking things and even heartbreaking things.  I’ve heard a woman read her credit card number out loud to someone on her mobile phone as she placed an order for delivery. I’ve seen a young girl’s knickers as she tried to fix her short tennis skirt. And I don’t mean the waistband. I’ve seen a grandma remove her dentures, tap it and replace it in her mouth. But one of the most shocking incidents I’ve… 
 I Wish to Wish a Wish 
 Silly Mummy 9 Jul 2012 | 3:45 pm {image source} I wish the world for my son. I wish he gets to grow up without much getting in his way. That he would become as beautiful a young man as he is now as a child. I wish he will always treat people kindly and that they give him the same in return. I wish the moon for my son. I wish he gets to discover all the things the universe has to offer. The oceans, the lakes, the deserts, the mountains, the volcanos and much, much more. That he loves all creatures and develop respect for every being that he touches. I wish the most delicious things for my son. He deserves all things we can…

There’s a review over here and the sneak peek down below. The Dark Knight Rises will be in cinemas across Australia from 19 July. But as we wait I thought what better…

 Unexpected Altitude 
 Susanna 28 Jun 2012 | 2:05 pm When I was a girl, the idea of doing the same job and going to the same place each day, 5 days a week, struck fear into my heart and made my blood run cold. That’s why I decided I would be a reporter. New things. Action. All the time. Mondays different from Tuesdays different from Wednesdays and on and on. Now I have these kids. And I love peace and quiet–at least the little whiffs of it that waft past me now and then. And so I love my peaceful routines that lend some kind of order to my world. Nay, I cherish them. I have this favorite trail that serves as the bedrock of my… 
 Emotional Boundaries and Other Silly Things

They explained that I could set some.“You’re in the wrong season of life to be so kind, Susanna. Save it for when you’re older. Most of your friends are just too needy – for either attention or babysitting—that if you show up and you listen for half a second, you will have someone at your door, asking you for favors and food and babysitting and for your shoulder to sniffle on, every single day of your young life.

 Hey Mr. Tandem Bike Man – Play a Song for Me 
 Susanna 19 Jun 2012 | 1:54 pm Just yesterday, I hear my husband on the back porch, his boots stomping up the steps at the end of his day in the real world. Finally. This summer day has been bejeweled and bedecked with wayward neighbor boys who keep finding themselves in my home office, asking me to make mac&amp;cheese or to bandage their booboos. But now – finally – it is early in the evening – and my man is home, and all I want to do is pour him a glass of wine, and one for myself, and sit on the cushiony wicker chairs on the front porch and kick my feet up onto the front rail and ask him to please tell me about…

 Feet Are Overrated 
 samanthamcgarry 11 Jul 2012 | 4:56 pm I’ve never been a fan of feet. Sure, they help you stand up, which is useful. But apart from ensuring our verticalness, it is my humble opinion that feet serve no redeeming purpose. Feet are ugly, full of callouses, dead skin, fungi, warts, blisters, bunions, gnarly toes and scratchy nails. They are usually smelly. They get hot and swollen from hours of being stuffed into oxygen-deprived socks and often ill-fitting shoes. Don’t even get me started on toe nails and the heinous act of nail clipping. If you are fortunate enough to have reasonably-sized ones, then a nice pair of shoes… 
 Happiness: It’s Your Choice, Kid 
 samanthamcgarry 7 Jul 2012 | 7:12 am Stop complaining. Quit your whining. Stop comparing what you have or don’t have to someone else. Don’t act like a victim. Happiness is your choice, kid. Only you can make the difference between a great day and a crappy one. So smile, keep your head held high, be a good friend, laugh, show kindness, participate and be sure to be silly. See, it’ll rub off on those around you. Make today as awesome as you are. (Applies to grown-ups too.) 
 On a Wing&amp;a Prayer 
 samanthamcgarry 5 Jul 2012 | 6:09 am I exist in“wing-it”mode. Both personally and professionally, I get by thanks to a canny mixture of knowing just enough about a lot of things, being a master of the multi-task, taking life one day at a time, faking it, a large dose of silliness plus the occasional lightning strike of serendipity. Lucky for me, it works most of the time. Being in my 40s helps too–apparently I project a sense of maturity and confidence that makes people think I know what I’m talking about. And much of the time I do! I’m not full of BS. I have experience, credentials,…

 Talkative Thursday: 93% Stress-Free Parenting 
 11 Jul 2012 | 9:00 am Doesn’t the title itself simply inspire? I attended this seminar in church last weekend, and it was taught by Dr. Robi Sonderegger, who is a clinical psychologist. As a parent of two, this title immediately spoke to me. Of course, the first (obvious) question would be … WHY 93% stress free? Haha… But I guess to bill it as a 100% stress free parenting seminar is a little idealistic and let’s face it, unrealistic. Any parent who’s been a parent for all of 5 minutes will experience STRESS! I remember when Jay was first born and we took him home. And then realised he has down with a… 
 A new bag 
 10 Jul 2012 | 6:00 pm Jay, in his last 2.5 years in childcare, has gone through about… 2 bags. That is amazingly frugal (by Mummy’s standard). Both bags had to be changed cos of extreme wear and tear (as can be expected of a four-year-old!). The last one, a Transformers bag, had its zip entirely zigzagged out, so he had to bring a bag with this huge gaping hole at the top for about two full days (while Mummy was a bit too busy to pop over to the shopping centre for a replacement). We popped over to Isetan, and we casually strolled past a display of Deuter bags, and I saw some child-sized ones. “Perfect for… 
 Off the floor&amp;walking! 
 10 Jul 2012 | 8:39 am My little boy is walking! Oh, it took him some time… and he sure took his own sweet time. But officially at a “ripe” old age of 15 months +, he has graduated from a few tentative steps, to walking up and down (and up and down) the house today! What a milestone for my little trooper! And needless to say, older brother is pleased to have his brother all “grown up” now (kidspeak for “Yippee! Finally someone to REALLY play with me!”). It is also perhaps inevitable for me to say: “Where did my baby go to?!?” Nonetheless, what a blessing it is to be able to be a part of…
