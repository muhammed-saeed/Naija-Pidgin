 My bloodtype is gravy. Mmmm.....gravy. 
​ You could say fat runs in my family. Like, genetically. That&apos;s my great grandpa to the right. They called him Chins Mulliggan.

He was an Irish gangster. A hard drinking killer that carried tripe in his overcoat pockets, and taught my father to do the same.

So I don&apos;t entirely blame the fast food industry for suckering me into a lifelong obsession with fried foods via the toys they used to market their food to me as a kid.

Fact is I probably would&apos;ve weighed 320 regardless. Plus, I still collect the toys.

Here are some of my favorite retro fast food toys:
 
 
​ 10. Burger King, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Late &apos;80s, early &apos;90s: I used to have the whole collection until my older brother made a bong out of Leonardo. Don&apos;t ask where he put the bowl.

 
 
​ 9. Long John Silver&apos;s, Free Willy 2 - Early 90&apos;s: Gotta love the irony of a fish house with a sad whale for a toy.

 
 
​ 8. McDonald&apos;s, Hamburglar hand puppet - &apos;80s: Me and this guy had some good times. He was my partner in crime. We used to jack fools for cheeseburgers together.

 
 
​ 7. Hardee&apos;s, California Raisins - 1988: Did anybody else have the Meet The Raisins album on tape? Man those wrinkly fuckers could sure carry a tune. I miss them.

 
 
​ 6. Dairy Queen, Double Dip Ice Cream Cone Fishing Lure&amp;Whistle - &apos;98 and &apos;91: If you&apos;ve ever gotten high and mistaken a piece of plastic for actual food then you know as well as I do that plastic shards will cut you to hell. Do not swallow.
