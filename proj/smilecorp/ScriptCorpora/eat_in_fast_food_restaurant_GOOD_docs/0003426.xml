 Pages : 1 2 3 [ 4 ] 5 6 7 8 9 10 setzor 12-19-2007, 10:47 AM With the mass banning being yesterday.. their might be a chance the RMT got us banned if so this might open up a new can of worms if we do manage to get our accounts back. Im gonna call in today maybe get a few questions answered n ask if they can tell me if my character has been suspended.

I have been having the same fear as well. I guess I should call at some point today and ask. This is just insane. Tawboo 12-19-2007, 11:10 AM Has anyone tried to contact their credit card company. If the hackers changed the credit card number and address but left your name and date of birth i think that is borderline fraud, if not true fraud. Even if it&apos;s just to ask simple questions like is this fraud....

or... to check if SE is PCI Compliant.

I&apos;ve been trying to look up PCI compliance information but I lack the time to really research the standards. Metalmyth 12-19-2007, 11:32 AM Although a world transfer did not happen when they had my account, if as some of you here have stated, the hacker used the rightful account owners Credit Card to charge the 25.00 transfer fee and then changed the credit card info...that is a charge you did not authorize...that is fraud.

If one of you that this happened to could push your credit card company to pursue they would have legal grounds to force SE to investigate as to who actually had contol of your account at the time of this charge, it further puts pressure on SE as to why they do not have a mechanism in place to deal with this type of action...imagine if Visa were to say&quot;either put in measures to prevent this in the future or we (VISA) will no longer allow charges from SE...just a thought Metalmyth 12-19-2007, 11:59 AM I think this is a really fine line here that alot of people are skating.

Outside of it being proven that the people doing this hacked SE&apos;s Databases or retrieved the information directly from SE, the fault HAS TO lie with the player.

SE can not be held responsible for security breaches on your system UNLESS, said breach was caused directly by their software. IE if POL had a security Hole that allowed access to your computer or some junk.

However that being said I do believe they have a responsibility to the customers to help retrieve accounts. However the problem is, there are many many many cases of people paying for peoples accounts. For example there is a person i know ingame who has never paid for her account, she has had random guys ingame paying for the account since she started.

( I am not a Lawyer) but it makes sense that SE can not withhold account information from the person paying for the account, and its a fine line when it comes to giving access to someone else when they are not the one paying for said account.

Either way SE is/would be supporting Identity theft if they did. IF they gave you access to the account after the payment info is switched the problem is by doing so, they are giving you access to the identity of the information of the person who&quot;stole&quot;the account.

Being that everyone lacks proof of whether or not that account is stolen or simply given away. So to say SE Customer service is lacking isnt incorrect, but from abusiness stand point they are in a very hard situation at the moment.

Again not supporting anyone just playing devils advocate

I am starting to get really frustrated with all these DWEEBS!!! Look you Dofus...DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF THAT IT WAS THE KEYLOGGER THAT DID THIS?? ...NO, then shut up and stick your theroies up your ass it is ASSUMPTION since your too stupid to look it up I&apos;ll spell it out for you....ASSUMTION IS A THERORY or THERORIES NOT BASED ON FACT

Yes it is popular theroy that the keylogger was the cause, but until SE gets off their butts and launches an offical investigation they are no better than you and others spouting off nothing but Theroies and pointing fingers, we don&apos;t need your half assed assumptions being logged here.

The fact is that a good 80% or better of us did have some form of protection running at the time of the attack and we were up to date, further and this is a FACT (check the thread for the screenshot) it is WOTG that asked we disable our A/V during installation and before you open your mouth...yes we were intelligent enough to turn it back on after the install. It is true it would have been only for 2-3 minutes but that is a lifetime in the networking world more than enough time to get in...yes that is an assumption but until we have the results from an investigation it seems to be the thing to do now doesn&apos;t it?

What proof (proof not heresy) do you have and not&quot;Well Joey said or it seems you all had XXX on your systems at the time&quot;there are over 400 and counting affected users not counting those who do not log their complaints to the forums...have you talked to every one of them?.......That&apos;s what I thought, the only way to get a concise answer is for SE to perform an investigation as they do know who all the affected users are and have the logs which shows what has been done, so only SE can launch an investigation and get to the truth as they have access to both pieces of the puzzle...deal with it SathFenrir 12-19-2007, 12:10 PM Tomake - Ifrit

Didn&apos;t bother searching for everyone, but...

You aren&apos;t banned. Mystics 12-19-2007, 12:24 PM bahh i sky... hey daniel have u seen novio&apos;s and Gaiters in rolanberry fields recently? Gere 12-19-2007, 12:40 PM I am starting to get really frustrated with all these DWEEBS!!! Look you Dofus...DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF THAT IT WAS THE KEYLOGGER THAT DID THIS?? ...NO, then shut up and stick your theroies up your ass it is ASSUMPTION since your too stupid to look it up I&apos;ll spell it out for you....ASSUMTION IS A THERORY or THERORIES NOT BASED ON FACT

You are an idiot we have plenty of proof the keylogger did this:

1)A single program was found on the PC&apos;s of most of the people who say they were hacked
2)this program is a known keylogger that was proven to have stolen wow accounts recently
3)an iframe was found on somepage.com that downloaded said program onto the pc of anyone who looked at the
front page using IE with a realplayer plugin which, was known to have an exploit that was patched recently (although only people who care enough about realplayer to update it frequently actually received the patch).
5)the iframe being inserted into an FFXI site proves that the keylogger was targeting ffxi users.

Now just because not every single person hacked reported having this keylogger doesn&apos;t prove that the keylogger wasn&apos;t responsible for the majority of the hackings, people have been getting their accounts stolen long before this keylogger even existed, hackings that do not involve this keylogger are merely coincidental in that they occurred in the same time period.

In fact, I suggest that any hacked players who do not find this keylogger on their computers GTFO this topic since you were obviously hacked by some other means (downloading trojan fleehacks and such).

Lastly, just because you run antivirus software does NOT mean you will be completely protected (especially against a newer virus). Only Kapersky and AVG were aware of this keylogger and were able to block it. MaachaQ 12-19-2007, 12:50 PM Funny thing tho that im wondering? With all the account jackings by these chinese scumbags (lets face it all the hackings are coming from there from what evidence we have from IP traces) its a pity SE wont simply just block all chinese IPs from ffxi at the very least it would block all these gilsellers from operating entirely from china at least :/

Pretty sure there&apos;s a lot of legit players in China as well.

A ban on IP addresses might catch me: I&apos;m a US citizen who spends part of the year in Korea, where my husband is a citizen and works. I expect there are other US citizens with US accounts all over the world, either travelling or moved there, who would be harmed by a complete ban on IP addresses in other countries. PrincessMinnet 12-19-2007, 12:53 PM Setzor is STILL on quizicotl farming in zitah on his nin/thf....God I hope they dont get him banned.
The STF is basically reiterating that if this has happened to you (the account hackings) then you&apos;re pretty much fucked because they arent gonna do anything about it. Kedra 12-19-2007, 01:03 PM Minnet

Was Setzor billed for the server transfer? setzor 12-19-2007, 01:19 PM i called and got verification of this yesterday. any server transfers made will be billed at the beginning of the month to the existing credit card on file. so anybody that was server transferred and had credit card information changed, will NOT be billed for the transfer. Clynt 12-19-2007, 01:19 PM So I haven&apos;t been keeping up with this a whole lot&lt;_&lt;is FFXIAH safe to use now? Metalmyth 12-19-2007, 01:21 PM I am starting to get really frustrated with all these DWEEBS!!!

Im an idiot

Let&apos;s take a look at your so called proof:

1.) So....we all had FFXI installed too.....and again did you check with every person who got hacked? Then it is not proof look up the word

2.) Again no proof if it was on every single persons computer ...in other words an assumption look it up still you have no proof

3.) Again do we know every single person visited that page...again no proof

5.) I would list number 4 but you are too stupid to count and when you listed your points you went from 3 to 5 (and I&apos;m an idiot lol) Yes that is what the source code shows but again there is no proof every single user affected had this keylogger so again you have no proof

YOU HAVE NOT PROVIDED ONE SINGLE OUNCE OF PROOF

As for your summary it is SE themslves that say you need to ensure that you are running A/V and your system has regular updates but by your own words&quot;just because you run antivirus software does NOT mean you will be completely protected (especially against a newer virus).&quot;then SE needs to address what else needs to be done, in other words the EU (paying customer) has followed all of SE&apos;s reccomendations and it is up to SE to provide further security. If SE feels there is only specfic A/V programs you can run or specfic updates then that needs to be stated, the fact that SE has done nothing about this other than do what you have done which is finger point and make assumptions further proves it now rests with SE to follow up with an offical investigation.

Before you start calling people idiot....try looking in the mirror

1...2...3...4...5 practice makes perfect Bungee 12-19-2007, 01:26 PM i called and got verification of this yesterday. any server transfers made will be billed at the beginning of the month to the existing credit card on file. so anybody that was server transferred and had credit card information changed, will NOT be billed for the transfer.

I canceled my credit card that I had on file with SE after my account was stolen. I didn&apos;t want the scumbags that stole my account to start making additional charges on it. The credit card company said no additional charges were made and it looks like my character was moved to another server. I&apos;m guessing as you mentioned that they wait until next month to charge for server transfers. I guess at this point SE will find out that the new credit card on file that the hackers put there will be invalid (hopefully). Too bad it didn&apos;t happen at the end of the month at least I wouldn&apos;t have to wait as long. Metalmyth 12-19-2007, 01:28 PM i called and got verification of this yesterday. any server transfers made will be billed at the beginning of the month to the existing credit card on file. so anybody that was server transferred and had credit card information changed, will NOT be billed for the transfer.

Hi Setzor

First off my heart goes out to you this really sucks but being that SE is using any loophole to lay blame and avoid the issue... at the time of the transfer a valid credit card had to be on file before they would initiate the transfer and that credit card would have been your&apos;s so technically regardless when the charge would occur it was your card used for verification before the transfer which you did not authorize in other words SE would not perform the transfer until a valid credit card was tied to the account...a loophole I agree but if SE is going to use them why shouldn&apos;t we Kanachan 12-19-2007, 01:45 PM They found my Assassin&apos;s armlets :/ Lahina 12-19-2007, 01:52 PM Forgive me for getting in this so late, however, doesn&apos;t SE have a bad password lockout policy? Metalmyth 12-19-2007, 02:03 PM Forgive me for getting in this so late, however, doesn&apos;t SE have a bad password lockout policy?

I can only tell you what happened to me....after three attempts it said my account was locked out but after only two minutes it allowed me to try again. And alhough I can&apos;t say for sure once you are logged on if an outside enity attempts while you are logged in nothing will happpen you will only get notified/booted off if they happen upon the correct username and password ronin sparthos 12-19-2007, 02:04 PM If you input the password wrong 3x, you get locked out for a while yes. But yeah... that doesnt help much. DanielRemora 12-19-2007, 02:06 PM bahh i sky... hey daniel have u seen novio&apos;s and Gaiters in rolanberry fields recently?
Nope, theres a couple of Novios being shouted though. Havn&apos;t seen any gaiters around Aidan 12-19-2007, 02:17 PM kimmie, sorry about the REALLY late response. Only info that was changed was the address (a commercial building in chicago with a few business&apos; inside, including a technology company), a cell phone number, and an aol email address. Credit card was still intact, largely in part, I think, because they tried selling the account on Syllna, figured the buyer would want to change servers, and they could tag the fee onto the current cc).

Sadly enough, after a few viral scans, spyware scans, and a change in password to something that was like, 15 letters/numbers long, all that crap, Syllna was hacked again sometime last night, BLM items being sold AGAIN by Oliyoutty, and was whisked away to the Sylph server.&quot;Syllna&quot;has already bought items to supplement his thief (which he was putting on hold re-gearing completely for a while). No idea what the account owner is doing, since I&apos;m assuming he&apos;s too pissed to talk to anyone atm. All I know is he&apos;s trying to get the FBI&apos;s cyber crimes involved. Feh. Stupid crap ftw.

So for those on Sylph, give Syllna absolute crap for us. :mad: Gere 12-19-2007, 02:30 PM I am starting to get really frustrated with all these DWEEBS!!!

Yeah you must be right, we need proof that this keylogger hacked every single ffxi player who has ever been hacked in the entire history of the game order to prove it hacked anyone at all. I must be a huge idiot because I made a single typo by moving my finger a centimeter to the right. :roll:


Now I know for a fact you&apos;re just a troll. Lordender 12-19-2007, 03:30 PM SE needs to get their heads outta their asses and start helping these players get out of this unfortunate experience. All of the evidence collected thus far points to chinese rmt from the ip lookup&apos;s. The I.frame on somepage and possibly a lot of other pages we don&apos;t know about blind sided the community. Who knows how many innocent players got infected just by doing the crafting campaign op&apos;s and using somepage to look up synths&gt;.&gt; Lahina 12-19-2007, 03:38 PM Damnit, if it&apos;s only a short-term lockout the only way to force a reset would be a tool you could just use to hack other people with&gt;&lt; danoob 12-19-2007, 03:58 PM I am starting to get really frustrated with all these DWEEBS!!!

It is true it would have been only for 2-3 minutes but that is a lifetime in the networking world more than enough time to get in...yes that is an assumption but until we have the results from an investigation it seems to be the thing to do now doesn&apos;t it?

What proof (proof not heresy) do you have and not&quot;Well Joey said or it seems you all had XXX on your systems at the time&quot;there are over 400 and counting affected users not counting those who do not log their complaints to the forums...have you talked to every one of them?.......That&apos;s what I thought, the only way to get a concise answer is for SE to perform an investigation as they do know who all the affected users are and have the logs which shows what has been done, so only SE can launch an investigation and get to the truth as they have access to both pieces of the puzzle...deal with it


So explain to me this. Do you think SE has not looked into their systems? Do you think SE is going to come out and say OH wait its a whole in our system and RMT got access to our account database.

What exactly do you want SE to do? I mean besides give you your account back. (Thats a given)

But SE has a good of chance in figuring how the people got the account info as you do IF, they did not hack into their databases.

This forum is a great way to report the toons&quot;stolen&quot;, but like I said it is a fine line.

Hypothetical situation. I have been paying for my friends account for over a year, one day he gets mad at me and switchs the account to his payment info, I call SE report the account&quot;stolen&quot;should they give the account to me?

Again I am not saying that SE is not at fault for not restoring stolen accounts, if you can provide the cd keys. But again its a fine line.

Has anyone tried offering to forward them proof they are the owner of the account (Ie Driver&apos;s License) and see if that helps?

And as far as the argument&quot;the installation told me to turn off my antivirus so lets blame them&quot;goes.. that is the problem with the tort system in America. People want to blame everyone else and even if their own stupidity cost them, well by god they shouldnt have to suffer cause someone should have told them not to.

In fact lets all sue Al Gore. IF he never invented the Internet noones accounts would have ever gotten stolen. danoob 12-19-2007, 04:04 PM For those who don&apos;t want to uninstall or forgot seeing it:


Oh I would also like to add that Background applications would include any and all Keyloggers, trojans and any other viruses.

If you disabled the firewalls and antiviruses but not the viruses, well again thats your own stupidity not SE&apos;s Fhqwghads 12-19-2007, 04:07 PM Well, bad news. I talked with a lawyer in my legal plan who specialized in internet-based law, and he said that there&apos;s really nothing that can be done with regards to this. The most people can hope for is that their account is billed the month their account is hacked and their credit card pays for it. You can call up the credit card company at that point, if SE refuses to help, and dispute the charges for that month only. SE can lose their right to process transactions with that credit card company if they don&apos;t reverse the charges, because you&apos;re paying for services you are not receiving.

He said that since SE is based in Japan, even though there are offices in the U.S., it would be incredibly expensive to go after them over something like this. He said it boils down to proving&quot;consequential damages&quot;, which is very hard to do, especially with a virtual environment like FFXI.

I&apos;m still of the mind that if SE doesn&apos;t change their policy, and the account hacking continues, there will be enough people to band together to hire a lawyer and move on a class-action lawsuit. There&apos;s lawyers who&apos;d love to make a name for themselves by filing a unique complaint such as this. Bungee 12-19-2007, 04:34 PM Has anyone tried offering to forward them proof they are the owner of the account (Ie Driver&apos;s License) and see if that helps?


FYI, I tried this as well. Since my name and date of birth etc. is still on my account I asked them if I can send them a fax of my Driver&apos;s license to prove that it was my name and my account. They said this wasn&apos;t one of the ways they could verify the account :roll: setzor 12-19-2007, 05:10 PM Has anyone tried offering to forward them proof they are the owner of the account (Ie Driver&apos;s License) and see if that helps?

You guys can try every&quot;bright idea&quot;you want to try to get the account information for a US account, but they are FIRM, and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s been hella reinforced by their management, given how firm they stand by it. You will NOT get your account password by giving them ANY other information than the First and Last Sets of 4 Digits on your Credit Card on file at the time you call. They won&apos;t fall victim to your guilt trips or angry tone, they probably tune you out if you go into all the&quot;evidence&quot;you can present them that the account is really yours but was stolen and what not. They don&apos;t care, they will never care unless SE tells them DIRECTLY otherwise. You won&apos;t be able to call back over and over and get a&quot;nice one&quot;. They are obviously following this one by the book for the sake of keeping their jobs. They, by now, are probably getting very agitated everytime they hear the words&quot;hacked&quot;or&quot;hi-jacked&quot;or&quot;stolen&quot;, and already know where the call is gonna end up the minute you say the first digit of your credit card that doesn&apos;t match what they see. We aren&apos;t going to be able to harass them into submission. Period. I&apos;m sure if they were able to treat this with their own gut feeling than MAYBE some of us would get lucky and get our accounts back, but in this case, SE is probably watching them like hawks.

What am I doing to help us get our accounts back? I&apos;ve sent 5 page letters to every email address i can find that has their domain in it in hopes of it reaching the top. All i seem to get back are emails like this:

I would show you guys the email but it contains alot of information I don&apos;t care to share with the whole world. And no, Niel of SE Customer Support, Your email doesn&apos;t answer ANY of the questions I asked in my email. You obviously hit the standard&quot;ffxi related question hand-off reply&quot;button on my e-mail the minute you saw the word&quot;FFXI&quot;in the subject, and went about your business.

This isn&apos;t an easy fight, and I&apos;m already of the firm opinion we aren&apos;t gonna get anywhere with this. I&apos;m personally giving SE til Monday to even respond to us about this matter, and give us a YAY or NAY. If they haven&apos;t even mentioned a word of our problem in specific by then, I&apos;m going to assume they are giving us the proverbial Finger and that we need to do whatever we&apos;ve been considering as alternative options for not getting our accounts back. For me, I won&apos;t be coming back. What if i spend another 2-3 years on this game and it happens again from some new-aged hack. I refuse to go through this turmoil a second time. Even if they change their policy, I&apos;m not coming back, because they might just change it back the day after i signup, or the day before i lose my account. They are literally relying on every fucking antivirus and webproxy/blocker to be exact second updated, and it&apos;s not how it works in real life. Maybe in japan they use smart antivirus/internet security that knows every virus the minute they are created and uploaded, but we dumb Americans have to suffer to regular antivirus and internet security applications.

Oh, and another thing, I sure hope you guys are spreading the word, just because a hundred or so of us are the only reported ones of being hacked, I&apos;m sure they got more account id/passwords then they know what to do with, and planning on using the few that they have until they get banned, then go into the next batch.

Clean up your machines, re-format if you have to, get your password changed, switch to another credit card. Be overly-cautious. setzor 12-19-2007, 07:37 PM Well, just got off the phone with someone from SE&apos;s Playonline Tech Support, and got a bit of info.

For one, I had a lengthy conversation with this guy, I knew from the start of the call that I wasn&apos;t getting my password, so I didn&apos;t even hit up that route, instead I just had a regular conversation about the current events trying to get any hopeful information for us getting our accounts back. He was a WoW player heh...

Here&apos;s the Info I got, don&apos;t look at this as me saying this to you, but what he was saying to me:

-----------
Apparantly the special task force is working heavily trying to come up with a solution to our problem.
They are being very secretive on their strategy and what not, but they are reading all forums available, any forum that has discussions on this issue is being checked, trying to gather any and all information.
We have been suggested to make posts to the special task force with any and all information regarding our accounts and events leading up to and during our characters kidnapping. Any information is helpful in this situation. Posting to them directly our ideas on the policy change is good. Threatening them with lawsuits is not good, and is counterproductive to them being able to help us. Even though our accounts are prepaid monthly, the person with the current credit card has the say on the account information. If we wanna dispute the current monthly charge, we need to take it up with our credit card providers. End of story.
------------

That&apos;s all I got, still waiting for the official announcement from the task force before I buy any of it.


See ya,
Setzor achren 12-19-2007, 07:41 PM 1 Please do not de-rail the thread
2 Ort and MAREM may be rmt.

ort is my rl boyfriend of almost five years whom i live with and have a child with.. we have both been playing on remora for nearly 3 1/2 years now. he is not rmt. can&apos;t say i know who marem is though.

sorry for de-railing but just clearing up the accusation. Bonkerskitty 12-19-2007, 07:47 PM Has anyone actually gone the route of doing what many SE representatives have told people.

Get a subpeona on the account information?

Maybe someone should, last I knew, it doesn&apos;t cost money to get a subpeona, it just takes 10-14days. Depending. nyphani 12-19-2007, 08:46 PM me and tli tried that today, called the Internet Crimes department of the local police, they said a subpeona can only be done if there is monetary loss and online accounts are not considered to have monetary value at this time. the dude tried to be helpful tho, he even called SE for us again(we&apos;ve called like 4 or 5 times now ourselves i think) and they told him that we would have to contact the canadian embasy in the US and that they would make us a subpeona there. he doubts thats posible, but SE said theyve gotten 100s of them. he also told SE that their policy doesnt make sence and they need to change it.. SE also said they passed everyone whos called in about their accounts over to the&quot;special task force&quot;so they can work on a way to deal with the situation and that theyre scrambling to figure out whats going on because they&apos;ve never been hit with something like this before.

i guess tomorrow we&apos;ll call SE back and ask how were suppose to get a subpeona if this isnt a valid situation, and if they dont say anything useful, i guess call the embassy?

and btw, did anyone try giving their reg codes to an EU freind to see if they could do anything? i thought i read someone was going to try that, but didnt see any responce. reg codes would probly be marked as NA anyways.. lucky EU&apos;s with youre logical policies :/

oh, a freind told me that Livinlegend of Titan also got hacked last night. don&apos;t know him or anything but.. another name to add to the list x.x lotsa my freinds are even afraid to log on now, really hope the&quot;special task force&quot;comes up with something soon.. Tlieaxu 12-19-2007, 09:24 PM strange enough I was just about to post that information, this is what I posted in my ls forum from my dealings so far.


Yesterday:

&quot;I called SE again today and instead of having them ask me a bunch of questions about who I am instead I didn&apos;t even tell them who I was and asked them as many questions as I could possibly think of, they stated they know about the issue and they are working on it, asked them what would happen to the accounts that were already lost, she said that they would be restoring them to the original owners once it&apos;s all worked out. I personally have a feeling this may be just a what can I say to get him off the phone but who knows I hope it&apos;s true, she also said there is no projected date of when this will be done, I asked so maybe 1 month or 3 years? she said not 3 years

I asked alot of questions like if this isn&apos;t my account then why did I pay this months service and can&apos;t play for half the month? can I get that refunded then? she said SE won&apos;t issue refunds it&apos;s in the ToS.

she said she has personally had account passwords reset with a subpoena going to be trying tomorow to contact the fraud department at local police.. I asked them what I should tell said police, she told me to tell them exactly what happened that my online account was accessed and taken over without my permision, and access was gained through illegal means. I then asked the question that is the answer about compromised accounts on the website that says SE will give full co-operation, she then said they will with a subpoena.

I asked how people are expected to prevent this or how we could prevent it from happening again in the future if we do get our accounts back she basically said she didn&apos;t know after I explained I used to work removing infections so I know how to protect a system this just got by as it could to others.

I stated they need to do something about the fact that thier encryption that had the POL ID and the password saved has been broken, she didn&apos;t seem to know what to say to that.

Oh, I asked what I need to do once I get said subpoena, she said the officer needs to call them and speak to a manager, and fax over the subpoena, I then asked about the issue where I have supposed to have been given a callback by a manager and haven&apos;t got one yet, and also seems nobody on forums posting is able to talk to a manager either, she said we can speak to one if he is availiable, so I asked, well is he? she then put me on hold for 5min and came back and said he was unavailiable, I asked if they even had managers, she stated the managers will call back people in the order they have asked for calls and there is alot of people wanting to speak to one because of this issue.

I forget what else I asked I will update when I think about it, I got her rep ID. She was more helpful then all the other useless people I have spoken to so far at least..&quot;


Today:

&quot;so, I called the internet crime department at the local police station, I spoke to the guy there, he explained we can&apos;t make a subpoena because it can only be done if there is any monetary loss involved and online accounts can&apos;t be classed as monetary value at this time. He did though take my information and call SE directly which SE then told without all the same questions answered as before they cannot do anything for him. They told him that this situation has now been sent over to the&quot;special task force&quot;and they are working on a way to deal with the situation and they are scrambling to figure out what&apos;s going on because they have never been hit with something like this before. He told them that there policies make no sense and need to be changed. He also asked them how people were supposed to get a subpoena and they told him I would need to call the Canadian embassy in the US and they would make out a subpoena for me, in which he told them that made no sense and he doubted they would do it. They claim they have gotten hundreds from there but I think it sounds really odd, and so did he. Unfortunately he said the only thing we can really do now is keep bugging them about it, and wait for this&quot;special task force&quot;to figure out what to do with the accounts and he said they told him if you have phoned in before to them your information has been sent to them.&quot;

and as Nyph said they claim they are getting hundreds of calls an hour about this.

well here is my update, I will probably end up calling again tomorow. Kelaiah 12-19-2007, 09:29 PM I actually logged on last night to make sure I hadn&apos;t been hacked since at the time I didn&apos;t know what caused it, just heard a rumour that tli and nyph lost their accounts. Thankfully I can log on and my younger brother can log on but this whole ordeal has really put a damper on everything related to the game.

To stay on topic, would I be able to get a subpoena for tli/nyph, or would they have to do it? Mystics 12-19-2007, 09:35 PM and btw, did anyone try giving their reg codes to an EU freind to see if they could do anything? i thought i read someone was going to try that, but didnt see any responce. reg codes would probly be marked as NA anyways.. lucky EU&apos;s with youre logical policies :/

I decided not to try b/c it prob would be a waist due to the fact that i read somebody that has both an EU account and a US account and that he had to install a US playonline to pay for the US account or something like that so i doubt the Playonline EU people will deal with a Playonline US Brill Weave 12-19-2007, 09:43 PM I&apos;m sure that I will probably get laughed off the board for this one. But anyways, I remember a few years ago Carbuncle&apos;s endgame was completely dominated by the RMT&apos;s.

A large group of posters from all the various websites around gathered together in one of the cities and made a mass GM call bemoaning the situation there.

I&apos;m not suggesting something like that. What I am suggesting is a walk out day. Anyone that knows a player who was hacked, any linkshell who has a hacked member in it, just not log on on one day.

I&apos;m just throwing it out there. SE has shown us repeatedly that they have no intention of actually assisting their honest customers. So one massive statement could do alot in showing them just how many people are tired of the shit they do(or don&apos;t do in this case.)

Anyways proceed with the lolz and all that jazz. It&apos;s just an idea. Vilhem 12-19-2007, 10:41 PM oh, a freind told me that Livinlegend of Titan also got hacked last night. don&apos;t know him or anything but.. another name to add to the list x.x lotsa my freinds are even afraid to log on now, really hope the&quot;special task force&quot;comes up with something soon..

Unfortunately this is true. Livinlegend&apos;s account was taken this morning Dec 19 :/ His close friend was able to trace his items to the seller Titlityty.

I spoke with Livin over vent and he had scanned his pc before and found nothing. He scanned again after he found out his pw had been changed and still nothing turned up. He did however, run into that weird POL behavior situation where it asked him to reinstall and re-enter his password and such&gt;&lt;Pretty sure this was the culprit :/ Kedra 12-19-2007, 11:07 PM and btw, did anyone try giving their reg codes to an EU freind to see if they could do anything? i thought i read someone was going to try that, but didnt see any responce. reg codes would probly be marked as NA anyways.. lucky EU&apos;s with youre logical policies :/

I decided not to try b/c it prob would be a waist due to the fact that i read somebody that has both an EU account and a US account and that he had to install a US playonline to pay for the US account or something like that so i doubt the Playonline EU people will deal with a Playonline US


Mystics its still worth a try. I was originally in the UK but was playing on a US account and had difficulties installing ToAU a while back. I called the EU help line and they still helped me even though I was on a US copy of the game. Nothing ventured nothing gained Vilhem 12-19-2007, 11:26 PM crossposting from our linkshell forums


Ran a scan while i played hockey and 3 trojans popped up idk if these are it or not cause im stupid when it comes to this stuff but they are the following:
entry.dll
key.dll
sleet.dll

idk could have nothing to due with this but just throwing it out there

Maybe these are the new wave of hackings?&gt;&lt; Kedra 12-19-2007, 11:30 PM Here&apos;s a couple of Senior people at SE you could try

SE Public Relations Manager EU
Alex Huhtala
Direct Dial Telephone 0044 207 324 5223
Email alexh@square-enix-europe.com

SE Inc (USA) PR team
Sonia Im or Charlie Sinhaseni
Telephone from US 310 846 0400

Clinton Foy, General Counsel, Vice President, Corporate Secretary at Square Enix, Inc.
Telephone 1-310-846-0400
Responsible for:
Intellectual property, international transactions, litigation, licensing, entertainment law.

Was unable to obtain contact details at SE for this guy but I DID manage to get his personal email address which is clintonfoy@gmail.com . But he does seem to be responsible for the Final Fantasy launch according to a few press releases. He also manages Legal and Corporate policies, so it would seem that this may well be the guy to go for. Given the email format for the EU email address its probably something along the lines of clintonf@square-enix-usa.com or something similar. Could be worth calling SE and saying that you are trying to email him using the above address but it appears to be incorrect can I please verify that I have the correct email address. Or if anyone is more email savvy than me and can manage to dig up this guys email address, it&apos;s worth a try.

During my little bit of Square research I came across this story about SE being sued and liable for $3.78 million refund for some cock up to do with failing to provide adequate source codes in Taiwan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. Interesting little read http://news.softpedia.com/news/Square-E ... 4918.shtml (http://news.softpedia.com/news/Square-Enix-Passible-for-3-78-Million-Refund-34918.shtml)

Good luck with contacting these guys. Keep me posted if any of you successfully manage to contact one or all of the above PrincessMinnet 12-20-2007, 12:08 AM FYI, I called the number Kedra has posted. Spoke to a really nice fella who actually treated me like a human being. It still boils down to THEY can&apos;t do anything...they dont have the authorization, no amount of calling pol support or that number can accomplish anything because their hands are tied by the policy and they dont have the authority to change the policy. The kind man did offer the&quot;GET A SUPONEA&quot;advice...and gave me a heads up....when you get a suponea, if it is for ALL the billing information on THAT account...it will have the NEW billing information on it as well.
Now..for those who might not catch the subtleness of that statement, This means we have a means of recourse against the people who stole it ( if the info that is on the billing addy is correct), it also means we can use that information obtained to call up POL with the CURRENT CC info and reclaim our accounts, log in and change the billing info to our own again as well as change all the passwords. This does NOT fix the issues at hand, SE still NEEDS to change their account retrieval policies. We all need to post in the suggestion area of SE our ideas of how they can fix it. We need to remain civil, keep in mind the guys you are talking to...it isnt directly their fault...they are peons just like you and me who have to work for a living and follow the rules their bosses give them. We arent gonna get anywhere in this by threatening law suits (no offense theeye and still think you should keep persuing it as a precaution if nothing else), by being beligerant on the phone, ect. This does NOT mean that I dont think we should hit up the media...I still feel that SE needs to take more responibility for the security of OUR information. When the accounts where stolen...our information was listed....that&apos;s a violation of the privacy act. Anyway everyone keep doing what you can, and dont give up hope...it was reitterated that SE&apos;s STF is monitoring all the forums and sites containing information regarding this situation. BTW....its not hundreds of accounts....its now in the THOUSANDS.
They HAVE realized this is going to hurt them in the long run by the loss of income....so yea they PROBABLY will eventually do something about it, but it&apos;s unknown what at this time. Change of policy takes time, lets try to be patient without rolling over and playing dead.



PS to the SE STF....I feel like an In-game widow...I want my tarutaru hubby back....PLEASE do everything possible to help us. We arent bad people, we are misfortunate. We DID take percautions (personally we&apos;re behind a firewall, have antivirus software, pop-blockers, and are behind a subnet) and still got hit by this. Please try to understand that we all feel absolutely helpless as the current policy leaves us no viable options for recovery. Most of us cant afford attourneys to get subponeas and arent law savy enough to know how to obtain one ourselves. The policy needs to change. I personally feel that a combination of using the original Registration Codes and a Secret Question to ever access or change anything on the account is the best solution. Most of the people I have talked to agree this is a good idea. Thank you for your time and attention to the severity of this issue. Kedra 12-20-2007, 12:15 AM Minnet, see above post, I just got Clinton Foys personal email address. Try it and see what happens, although I suspect he will just change ignore you, its worth a try

Here is a copy of the email that I sent to Mr Foys personal email address


Dear Mr Foy

I am writing to you on behalf of a group of Final Fantasy XI players. I realise that this is perhaps not the most suitable method of contacting you via your personal email. However I have been unable to contact you at Square Enix.

As you are probably already aware, a large number of players have found themselves falling victim to account theft recently on FFXI. It would appear that Square did such a good job at nailing the RMT to the wall that they are now resorting to account theft to make up for their loss of earnings.

Some reports from players are that they have fallen victim to Keyloggers which have been added as In Frame codes on several of the larger and well trusted FFXI sites such as ffxiah.com, Somepage, ffxicyclopedia etc as well as being found on boards such as guildportal which members use as linkshell forums.

Whilst we all do appreciate that computer security is our own responsibility and accept that fact as a given, this keylogger appears to have bypassed most of the major Virus protection programmes and firewalls. Square Enix themselves asked us all during the installation of WoTG to take our computer security offline during the installation.

We, as a community also accept that under the Terms of Service the selling of accounts is forbidden, although we all also know that this does go on.

Our plight is severalfold;

1) Square Enix is offering no support to victims of these recent keylogger attacks. The Customer Service team is implying that the victims have lost their accounts due to the fact that they shared their Playonline IDs and passwords.

2) Square are only offering to reset passwords for people IF they are able to provide the current credit card information on the account and/pr the current password. These are the two pieces of information that no one has been able to provide as the first thing the RMT do is change your password and billing information

3) Square Enix is refusing to accept the original CD registration keys, coupled with historical credit card information etc as sufficient to verify proper account ownership. Instead they are asking victims to obtain subpoenas. What are your customers really expected to do here? The police are too busy dealing with violent criminals, fraud etc to take seriously any complaint of theft which occurred in a computer game.

4) If you are logged into the game and someone tried to compromise your account then you (the rightful owner) are being kicked off by the RMT. Players have found themselves desperately trying to maintain control over their accounts whilst the RMT try to change their passwords.

5) It is too easy for passwords and billing information to be altered by 3rd parties. There should be adequate security needed to do this, for example having the original installation key codes or the use of secret questions.

6) Server transfers being immediate means that the minute an RMT group gains control of your account they are able to jump server with your character. They are fraudulently using the original account owners card details to process these server transfer transactions. Which is adding insult to injury; not only has their account been stolen, but they are paying for the privilege!

7) Square are adamantly advising players that we do not own these accounts, which we also accept. However if we are not the owners then presumably we are renting these from SE. My analogy here is that we are therefore similar to tenants whilst SE is similar to a landlord. If I as the tenant come home to find my apartment has been broken into and the door is damaged, the locks are broken etc then I as the tenant would contact the landlord to advise him accordingly. The landlord would not say to me&quot;well, as long as the people who have broken in are paying the rent then you are homeless&quot;. I would expect my landlord to be morally and ethically obliged to repair the damage so the apartment was habitable once again.

The customer base of Final Fantasy XI is disillusioned and scared that they will be the next victim in all of this and I am writing to you in the desperate hope that our voices are heard. I know that some people take the view that this is&quot;only a game&quot;, however this is a game that requires endless amounts of time and effort to progress in. Some people have poured their hearts and souls into Final Fantasy for over 4 years and have remained loyal to Square throughout this time, yet when they need Square&apos;s support the most they are having the proverbial door slammed in their faces.

We, the players think that Square Enix has a moral obligation here to offer any assistance that they can to restore accounts to their final owners.

Please can you help us?

Yours sincerely setzor 12-20-2007, 01:32 AM Very well written Kedra, agree with you 100%. Hopefully you won&apos;t get redirected to the POL support page like I did :( PrincessMinnet 12-20-2007, 02:43 AM Kedra, thank you for that, however...in my post I stated...the people at that office do not have the authority to do anything about this....this is something that has to go higher up than that. Kedra 12-20-2007, 02:53 AM You are welcome, this is something I feel strongly about. My email was sent to soemeone high up, I sent it to Clinton Foy, General Counsel, Vice President, Corporate Secretary at Square Enix, Inc. The guy who is responsible for SEs policy and legal obligations. I managed to find his personal email address and sent it to that. Lets see if I get a reply, although I doubt it Sika 12-20-2007, 03:10 AM I was hacked on December 10, 2007 :(

I filed my police report on December 12, 2007 :) I have alot of hope in this action.

December 17 I called SE in regards to how my police officer could contact them. Because he was still trying to reach Mr. Bigsby at no avail. They happily gave me a fax number (which I will not provide because I do not want this phone to be spammed and shut down like others have been) and told me to have the officer fax the supena.

I also put my police report number on my IC3 filing, thus giving that complaint more weight.

I know its not fun to sit and explain to a police officer how the game works or how what I lost was of monetary value. But I was able to do it and those of you brushed off by your local authorities might want to try again. Game Currency/Items does have monetary value otherwise companies like ige wouldnt be in business. BTW I referrenced IGE.com in my police statement since they clearly give an exchange rate on the front page ($50 a mil on Kujata).

So I would like to encourage those who havent too or try again to file your police reports and add them to your IC3.gov complaint.


BG OMG no no OOOOMMMMGGG You Guys Are My Biggest Heroes!
and... Tarutaru&gt;ALL Marajade 12-20-2007, 03:56 AM I wonder if they used the same CC for a bunch of different stolen accounts. If so the info one person gets from a subpoena could in turn help others get their accounts back. Catrina 12-20-2007, 04:39 AM I think there&apos;s a limit of 4 accounts per CC (at least I remember someone complaining that the account wouldn&apos;t take any more accounts). Then again, they never had issues getting their hands on multiple credit cards, the RMT boss likely has a lot of bank accounts to ask them from. Ashky 12-20-2007, 07:46 AM I think your best bet at this point is to do as one of the above posters said and show the Internet Crimes people IGE.com and accounts on EBay and such to show them these accounts DO have monetary value and that is the root of this whole problem. If there were no money to be made, IGE would not exist. Sounds like real progress is being made. And to those who said to stop spamming them and threatening them, don&apos;t. That is a complete load of crap. If you all stopped calling today, they&apos;d sweep it under the rug and go on with their lives. The reason they do care is they realize how many people this affects and pisses off. Keep up the good work! isladar 12-20-2007, 09:52 AM A very good letter

Bravo on this. It is well written, and appeals to rather than rages at SE. I hope very much that it is given the time it deserves. Octavious 12-20-2007, 11:06 AM I&apos;ve been keeping up with this since it started and the sad fact is it sucks but 50% of you possibly won&apos;t get your accounts back. Even if/when they do restore rightful ownership, anyone who&apos;s had a character recovered from SE can tell you that certain items tend to be missing anyway (Sorrower came back without W.Turban, orz). Also, the idea that SE will change their policies (while I agree their policies are retarded) is probably going to have a null effect.

The reason I say this, is because it&apos;s like you complaining to McDonalds about a bad batch of fries, and storming out. Now I&apos;m not bringing up the &apos;fat&apos; arguement, simply that McDonalds could piss off 1,000~ people and not give you a second glance, simply because you don&apos;t mean jack shit to them. Sure you can tell 1~10 others about your bad experience, but it won&apos;t stop them. I&apos;m not saying bad service never destroyed a company, but in all honesty when the next FF comes out most/if not all of you will buy it. Most/if not all of you have purchased FFXII, Revenant Wings, or Tactics Adv. etc.

SE&apos;s Policies on one game might lead that game to its demise, but by no means will they take more then a passing glance half of the time as 100~accounts from 500,000 subscribers is equivilant to taking a piss in the ocean.

I do wish everyone the best of luck in the retrieval of your accounts as well as I do hope SE does something to change their mind-numbing policies. However the simple fact is we&apos;re disposable to them and SE&apos;s policies make you feel like less of a customer, and more of a recipt. The Almighty Dollar (Yen?) is what most companys go after, sadly. =/ PrincessMinnet 12-20-2007, 11:34 AM I&apos;ve been keeping up with this since it started and the sad fact is it sucks but 50% of you possibly won&apos;t get your accounts back.

It isnt hundreds of accounts....its thousands of accounts....and the numbers are growing every day. That piss in the ocean....looks like its being taken by a God that&apos;s bigger than it.....given time, enough of these accounts will be hacked that it makes a huge difference. And when all the players who have legit accounts stolen now, give up and those accounts get banned for RMT activities...guess what the RMTS will just steal more....so there&apos;s thousands of more accounts....they wont stop until SE changes the policy which allows them to do this. And yes I know in the big picture, in all likelyhood alot of people WOULD still buy SE products dispite all this....I personally have always loved SE games, but would no longer purchace anything SE puts out no matter how much i&apos;d like to play it. There are some of us with strong enough morals and principles that we would refrain. Getting the news out...may or may not make a difference...but I can garuntee one thing, sitting around on our asses and doing nothing, will accomplish NOTHING. Rescue 12-20-2007, 11:40 AM Here’s a question for those that live in the states. Have any of you tried to contact your states attorney general over this situation? Octavious 12-20-2007, 11:52 AM 1,000&apos;s of accounts? I understand there&apos;s beena high amount of people hacked, however 1,000+? Sounds unreasonably high. danoob 12-20-2007, 12:48 PM Does SE&apos;s account restorale policy suck yes?

But to keep saying somehow that all of this is SE&apos;s fault is comical. First off people need to realise its their own fault. Second they need to follow the instructions provided to them to try and get this sorted out.

SE said the STF is working on it. There is no reason to take them as liars Metalmyth 12-20-2007, 01:03 PM Not sure if everyone has seen this and if it is the one from here but I just signed it:

Online petitions are proven to get SOOOOOOoooo much done.


P.S. Online Petitions are jokes, and no reputable company would ever take one seriously.


P.P.S. If you want results send non-chain letter emails, and write a damn letter. You are way more likely to get a response that way. Sykes 12-20-2007, 01:27 PM write a damn letter

Only to show that petitions can be used to raise awareness to issues and that even government officials use them. So I don&apos;t think petitions are useless. I understand you think they are totally irrelevant and I agree that a majority don&apos;t help, but people are trying to take action and your negative feedback isn&apos;t helping.

If you have a better idea and would like to take some initiative please do so.

BG itself makes up approximately 1-2% of the community of FFXI players. Of about 5000 moderately active posters, about 200-300 of them have lost accounts. Thats a pretty big number. So honestly, I can EASILY see a few thousand if not more accounts lost. Ill tell you right now that if SE doesnt do anything about this, it will get picked up by some large magazines, this is an extinction level event for them, they can be the heroes if they play the cards right. When your shit gets jacked in WoW, blizzard says WUUUUAAAA? And rolls out the fists of fury on whoever did it, thats customer support right there. You get your shit back and they give you a hug and a backrub. Octavious 12-20-2007, 01:53 PM 100,000~? Almost as entertaining as Ron Paul&apos;s run for office. (Yea I Went There, w) Regardless;


While the Constitution outlines the basic process for impeachment, the specific procedures are determined by the internal rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate. To begin, the House of Representatives refers the investigation to its Judiciary Committee, which reviews the evidence and may conduct hearings. It determines whether an official impeachment inquiry is warranted and, if so, asks the House for permission to proceed. An official investigation follows, with the Committee deciding whether to offer articles of impeachment to the full House. The House then votes separately on each of the articles, with a simple majority needed to impeach the official. Articles of impeachment approved by the House are then presented to the Secretary of the U.S. Senate for trial.

He may be able to get people to sign his online petition, but it won&apos;t convince washington in the least. You said it yourself, at best it will bring the issue to light but by no means would an online petition actually accomplish something useful. Shoot, make a picket line they&apos;re more entertaining and they probably will get the issue out there just as much as an online petition.

Additionally, I see where you&apos;re going with the account number which does make more sense as I read your post. However i&apos;ve yet to actually see more then a review from any magazine, even Game Informer rarely mentions FFXI. At least it hasn&apos;t stuck in my mind the last time I read about it...I just got the Dec07 issue so i&apos;ll be flipping through that shortly.

Another angle for this would also be since SE is creating another MMO, part of me wonders if they even care. Hopefully their next MMO won&apos;t have 90% of the bullshit we belly-ached about for 3+ years of FFXI.

I guess you missed it when Kucinich&apos;s impeachment resolution has already been sent to the judiciary committee.

I didn&apos;t post that link to discuss impeachment, but to show that even prominent figures use online petitions to raise awareness. It isn&apos;t guaranteed to have results, but it shows a unified front of opinion.

The hard part is for the petition to actually get into the hands of someone at SE who actually has a say in policy change.
I believe SE will change their policy if they see that their profits will be hurt. Tadghostal 12-20-2007, 02:20 PM Add Cloull of Garuda to the list of hacked players. His mule, Suzaka, was stolen as well.

TAD ANGRY TAD SMASH


As many of you know, I was hacked last week, but I was able to get back on and change my password. Since then, things have be fine and I thought I was going to be okay. I had deleted all the keylogger files last week before I logged on, and was hacked 2 days after I had done so, so they got my password from before and had taken their time to get to my account.

Apparently, even without the keylogger, they got my new password, I don&apos;t know how. Somewhere between 4 am last night and 1:30 today, Cloull and Suzaka are no longer mine, and I&apos;m sure all gear has been stripped, and all the money removed from my account. I had 500k on Suzaka, and about 50k on Cloull, but I&apos;m sure I totalled over 3M in gear.

If I&apos;m ever able to get Cloull back under my control, I may play again, it depends on how much I lost.

I&apos;ll miss you guys until then, you were my friends, and my second family. :)

EDIT: Just to put out there for those that may be curious. No, I never visited somepage.com since I changed my password and I&apos;ve been running FireFox with the add-ons since I changed it. ronin sparthos 12-20-2007, 02:22 PM Meanwhile SE execs drink only the finest sake and when they hear of your plight they blow Cuban cigar smoke in your face?

Awesome S&amp;M.. er tech support SE is running....

Overall SE needs some bad press to change there idea of how to handle ingame issues, and i hope that survey will be the start of them seeing how &apos;loved&apos; there ideas are regarding the ToS and tech/account support is.

Like someone said earlier.... any free services tech support is better than what SE is running in the NA. tymora 12-20-2007, 02:28 PM Anyone did a search on root-kits? That key-logger we thought we found may have a hidden aspect to it or it could be another tool/trojan/virus entirely. Perhaps the&quot;exe&quot;dropped off a rootkit before removing or hiding using the kit after. This would mean that a simple search/scan won&apos;t reveal it at all. And if it self-deleted itself or hid itself, the common user won&apos;t even know their system has been compromised until it is too late.

Fhqwghads 12-20-2007, 02:52 PM SE may be slow to action, but let&apos;s get something straight: they do eventually address issues when they see it&apos;s having a serious impact on the game. Evidence? STF. They&apos;ve created a branch that have devastated RMT to the point that they&apos;re attacking the same people they&apos;re trying to cater to (which is incredibly ironic.) They&apos;ve changed and tweaked game mechanics to cater to (most of) the requests we&apos;ve had over the years. One thing you can count on, when they get the ball rolling on this, it&apos;s going to be effective, and hopefully like Sono-cat said, they&apos;ll help the victims out.

This is IGE (http://www.mmobux.com/articles/760/the-rise-and-fall-of-ige) tymora 12-20-2007, 08:49 PM Hey guys,

I got my pw reset after going to the bank to find an old credit card number i cancelled half a year back to verify since i didn&apos;t have my registration keys.

I thought they would only take the expensive items, like they did with celenes a month back.. hell they left unji/unsho on him.. not me though heh.. They seriously took everything off kys.. Not only my ebow and striders.. they took my fucking war bow too. Everything short of arrows and ninja tools, and half a stack of gold beastcoins which i guess would take too long to sell without a full stack.


i want to say thanks everyone for everything.. Some people i&apos;ve been playing with forever but some i&apos;ve just started playing with recently... Caff&apos;s been through some rough times haha.. like only 2-3 people in LS rough.. but i love the way it is now. We lazy but hell, ain&apos;t shit we can&apos;t kill if we wanted to.

Vig man, it&apos;s been a long time huh? and thanks for letting me caffeine when i came back to play.. even though you made me apply we both knew you had my back if i was ever in game.

i&apos;m happy that we could make up too syan heh.. i know i went ape shit on you the last time i quit, but i&apos;ve changed a bit and you have too so i guess we were able to get along in the end.. wow that&apos;s some sappy shit right there lol


My LS mate got hacked on Pandemonium. Kys is the name and Supmule is the culprit. Except we can&apos;t do shit about it. Kimmie 12-20-2007, 09:55 PM Does anyone know if faxing a police report would suffice? PrincessMinnet 12-20-2007, 10:55 PM I have been informed by someone who spoke with a GM that SE&apos;s legal department is working on sueing the RMT hackers...I dont know if the GM was telling the truth or not...but this is the information I was given. Seems to me...if SE is acknowledging the accounts are stolen, and are seeking lawsuits on the RMT....then shouldnt it stand to reason they&apos;d give us back our accounts? Please SE...make some kind of public statement so we arent in the dark here. Give us some kind of sign that you&apos;re doing something other than sitting there laughing at us. Bonkerskitty 12-21-2007, 03:34 AM This is a post by a fellow LS member after he talked to SE earlier yesterday. Wanted to help confirm Minnet&apos;s posts that thousands of accounts have been hacked/comprimised. As well as update you with some new information. Please report your account if its been touched.



Garion of Lakshmi, The Fallen Angels LS-

Well, I called SE today because I wanted to ask thim if its possible to note my account to say that I will NEVER change my PW in game, and would only call them. And if any of my info changed that it wasn&apos;t me so they would give me my account back. I was told&quot;We have been ordered by the upper managment to not do anything of this type to any accounts&quot;. So yeah, they don&apos;t give a fuck about protecting accounts YET to be hacked.

I continued to speak with the person for almost an hour about what has been going on in FFXI. From what I am told, the number of hacked accounts in EU JP and NA have now reached over the 2,500 mark. With almost 50-100 accounts being reported as hacked every day. They basicly said they are not allowed to do anything at all because it has been turned over to a brand new part of the Special Task Force that is working totaly on the problem. When a solution is reached, the accounts will aparantly be returned to the owner (unknown if it will be transfered back to the right server) AS IS with no Gear compinsation for tradables.

The person i spoke to seemed to have been taking calls on hacked accounts all day every day. lol he told me&quot;Its nice to talk to someone that hasn&apos;t lost thier account and dosn&apos;t want to damn me to hell&quot;From what i understand SE is taking legal action (or atempting to) agaist the CC holders of the accounts being hacked, and they have already linked some of them to the known site http://www.IGE.com. They are seeking legal action in 11 countries to find out if there is anything that they can do legaly to keep IGE from selling gil. He told me that 3 ppl have been charged, but he didn&apos;t know with what, in regards to the accounts being hacked.

At this point he told me that if i didn&apos;t have any more questions he would have to let me go, So i said goodbye and hung up.

I would realy like to know what is actualy being done about the POLICIES SE has for gaining password&apos;s to accounts and basicly Account support in general but he had no information on that at all. He had no idea if it would be changed.

So, that was my chat. Anyone else spoken to them about this? Rena 12-21-2007, 08:24 AM When a solution is reached, the accounts will aparantly be returned to the owner (unknown if it will be transfered back to the right server) AS IS with no Gear compinsation for tradables.
No gear compensation? :| Now that&apos;s screwed up, hopefully that&apos;s not correct, but for various reasons, I see that as pretty believable.

That&apos;s good news though, hopefully they&apos;ll succeed on this point at least.

But still... if they can&apos;t return gear, that&apos;s really screwed up. They&apos;re gonna lose a lot of customers if they don&apos;t. Gilanth 12-21-2007, 08:34 AM So if IGE now has too much gil will we see a supersale and the return of the inflation levels of a couple christmas&apos;s ago :( setzor 12-21-2007, 09:04 AM meh, the problem with not resetting accounts however, is that the fact is, our characters are being controlled by RMT, and what if one of us are the lucky ones that was holding all the gil they were farming to sell, one of us could login and find 200+ mil on our character when we only had like 50k when we were hacked. that person will be overjoyed of course, but to the rest of us, we&apos;ll more than likely end up with completely empty wallets, and just some misc crap RMT gear with everything else we valued tossed or sold for space.

I think you may be able to at least get the nomad cap if they tossed, being non sellable, from fanfest, and that dropped item rule. No idea if that&apos;s what you&apos;re thinking about, though. It&apos;s always shittier when it involves signed items, those may not be replaced if the person that signed quit the game. Anything else can be replaced, it will take time, and effort, but can be done. Tordall 12-21-2007, 09:20 AM Maybe SE will finally realize that gil-BUYERS are the real issue. Until they&apos;re dealt with they&apos;re just playing whack-a-mole. And yes, I know that would decimate the end-game community on most servers.

Either you or your wife posted a pic... lol... I happen to have a good memory, and found the 2 of you posing with them adorable... danoob 12-21-2007, 10:43 AM When I spoke to IGE about the stolen accounts, and how it was strange that they have just stopped buying all gil from players, when we can expect the super duper christmas sell they must be leading to. (they are running out of time!)

And she said there were no christmas sales planned, and in fact they wont even price match anymore.

They also no longer Powerlevel accounts for the time being.


Lots of weird stuff happening... Tenken no Soujiro 12-21-2007, 12:14 PM I gave customer service another call today not to bitch or argue since that&apos;s pointless now but I just wanted to check to make sure that my account had been flagged to the STF since people are being told now that they are handling the issue.

I didn&apos;t talk to the guy for long at all and I didn&apos;t get much info as to what&apos;s going on right now but he did tell me something I haven&apos;t heard before. He said that the STF has been able to&quot;freeze&quot;some of the accounts so far. He said he didn&apos;t know the specifics of why they were doing this to some of them and not all that were reported so it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess right now.

The only other thing I really talked to him about was the reports of UK CSR&apos;s returning accounts if you can provide registration codes for the original and all of the expansions. He said it was the first he&apos;s heard of it and that they (North America) have definitely been drilled to accept nothing other than the current CC like we&apos;ve been told.

Not much else other than that. He claimed that if the STF determined the accounts were stolen then they would be calling us to let us know. I hope what others were told about characters being returned&quot;as is&quot;won&apos;t be the case. I know that may be good enough for some people but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;d be worth it to me. I don&apos;t want to get it back so the only thing I&apos;ll be able to do with it is to try to put back what&apos;s taken me over 4 years to get in the first place. That&apos;s only counting the stuff you can buy too. Who knows how much R/E stuff has been dropped just so they can make room for their crappy farming drops to sell. Only time will tell when or if they will do anything at all. I just have a feeling that even if they do it&apos;ll be too little too late. pinkie 12-21-2007, 01:59 PM Either you or your wife posted a pic... lol...

all suspisios looking mules. unless a bunch of random ppl decided to retire some of their main jobs and make new jeuno mules just to sell their junk(most of these accounts did not have any price history before dec. 16), they look pritty funny to me. some moreso then others..

i pitty whoever the blm that got kidnapped was.. (check padgett) that was some awsome blm :(

algut seems to be the one selling me and tli&apos;s stuff :/ everything hes sold so far is stuff we had.
a freind of mine /sea&apos;d for algut and apparently he had a kclub in bazzar as well(me and tli didnt have one of those, anyone else&apos;s maybe?). freind asked him if he happened to have a plastron for sale too(only uncommon expencive peice of armor i had that i can think of D:), he said he did and&quot;how much u buy?&quot;then another freind started talking to him and i think he caught onto why we were interrogating him, he said&quot;I don&apos;t have you password, if I did then I log onto your character too . lol&quot;then&quot;If I had their password, then I can get more password, include bank. Do you know?&quot;no idea what thats supposed to mean but... yeeah.... livinlegend 12-21-2007, 03:34 PM Titlityty is selling my stuff ronin sparthos 12-21-2007, 05:09 PM Check for this annoying bug: C:\Windows\system32\CMCFG3.dll

Trojan.Win32.BHO.abo is the trojan name for it. Paulisdead 12-21-2007, 05:43 PM Check for this annoying bug: C:\Windows\system32\CMCFG3.dll

Kaspersky/AVG can detect it, but not remove it.

Seems like something new.

Trojan.Win32.BHO.abo is the trojan name for it.

Not too sure on this I googled it and there was a few results but the top links were in Italian I think the one that I could read was http://forum.networktechs.com/showthread.php?t=4525 It mentions a program called Combofix and the I read a second thread that also pointed to Combofix. Not sure if this going to help or not but I wish you the best of luck in removing this.

Also searching for Trojan.Win32.BHO.abo points to this http://www.lavasoftsupport.com/index.ph ... opic=14816 (http://www.lavasoftsupport.com/index.php?showtopic=14816)

But there is not a lot of info from major sites like Symantec etc on this particular file/trojan.

Please note I cant vouch for any of the above links validity. They seem decent enough but please be careful.

Promptly nuked it, booted into linux, IM&apos;d a PS2-onry friend to change my FFXI PW. Copying my school-related files over to the other partition on this drive and reinstalling.

Not taking any chances&lt;_&lt; Minions 12-21-2007, 09:31 PM The file itself is a legit windows file. Well cmcfg32.dll is. As far as I&apos;ve seen. lots of Trojans are renamed to legit files though so you wont know, so that could be the case. Naramaska 12-21-2007, 09:46 PM The file itself is a legit windows file.

Correct, CMCFG32.dll is a windows file. CMCFG3.dll, however, is not :P

AVG didn&apos;t detect it for Sparth but Kaspersky did, so i&apos;m scanning with that now. We&apos;ll see how it goes; told it to do the most thorough scan it possibly could so it won&apos;t be finished for another hour+ ronin sparthos 12-21-2007, 10:08 PM Slowpersky picked it up yeah, but it cant remove it.

Every little bit of evidence helps. Even though it may be a long shot.

ya he did, but it was from another account(no idea why he didnt use his acct), and the GM compleatly ignored him when he sent him tells from his chara til he started to send&quot;innappropriet tells&quot;, then he got jailed, then banned, then he called a new GM who told him&quot;his acct was suspended because he used 3rd pt tools&quot;he was like&quot;uh.. what?&quot;then GM was like&quot;Oh, my bad. I got your account mixed up with another. I&apos;m very sorry.&quot;then he was placed back in whitegate and none of the GM&apos;s actualy looked into why he was orignaly calling..

tli called SE again today to check to be sure our accts have been flagged for the&quot;special task force&quot;to be looking into, we must have got the dumbest dude there.... wanted to conferm what ppl have been saying, about there being over 2500+ accts now, he claimed it was the first he heard about it, and he hasnt gotten any calls about it today at all, we asked for his rep id and he had no idea what that was, tried to give us his name instead, then went to go find out if he had an id.. comes back and said&quot;oh i guess this could work..&quot;&quot;.. what is it?&quot;&quot;theres a number on my badge&quot;&quot;... sure. youve been working there how long?&quot;&quot;quite a while&quot;&quot;and youve never had anyone ask you for your rep id?&quot;&quot;nope&quot;(Wybert, rep id 07198)we also asked him if he hadnt heard anything about anything thats been going on, then where has everyone been getting their info from, he said he didnt know and he didnt think anyone else at SE was telling them stuff like that.

after we found out that he was actualy from the technical support section(we had selected accounts and billing), and neither of us could figure out how we had been transfered there instead. i guess technical support guys arnt kept up to date on the latest info&gt;.&gt;since he was in tech support and didnt know anything, we told him that the passwords were being decripted and that should be considered a technical problem. he said he couldnt change that because it was developer lvl. he mentioned that keylogger only records keystrokes(we hadnt said anything about keyloggers, so much for not knowing anything about the situation..) we told him we hadnt typed in our passwords for months, so its not just a keylogger.

he did say something useful at least, that we could fax in a police report instead of a supoena and then they would&quot;investigate it&quot;. unfortunatly our hightech crimes dept has gone on holidays til the 27th, if that, moste are away til the newyear. so for now suppose all we can do is wait.. or call back SE and see if someone else gives us a different story. seems to change every time we call... Lordender 12-22-2007, 06:00 AM You know SE is damn fucking lucky that people are fighting for their accounts by calling them everyday trying to get them back than people saying fuck this company, call them a joke and take their business elsewhere. SE needs to re-think all their policies, re-structure them so they can handle events like these more efficiently. RMT aren&apos;t gonna just go away like turds do when their flushed down a toliet, their gonna continue to find ways to make gil even if its unlawful.


Those rmt bastards are determined, they will always be determined to make a living off ffxi. I think only up-to-date policies that help people get their accounts back is the right course of action. Account security should be in a players hand up to a certain point, but when you lose your account because you had to use the better fansites to look up recipe&apos;s to beat the crafting campaign op&apos;s that end up causing you to lose your account = fucked up. This could explain why a lot of this is happening after WoTG went live and more people went to those sites. livinlegend 12-22-2007, 10:35 AM Wow nyphani i had Wybert as well about 3 days ago now so bullshit he doesnt know whats going on. Also he did the same thing with me saying he didn&apos;t know who his supervisor was or his phone or anything, he was the most useless out of the 7 people i have talked to thus far. Metalmyth 12-22-2007, 11:01 AM Good Morning Everyone

As most of you know, I like everyone here had my account hijacked, before I begin my heart goes out to all of you that have not been able to get your accounts back and I can only hope that SE will make it right!! I was fortunate enough (if you would like to use that word) to get my account back but was stripped of 13 + million of gear/gil basically leaving me in a postion of logging into Whitegate and standing...no gear..no gil...no food...no ammo. Basically powerless to do anything, it has taken me close to 3 years of lesiure playing to level two characters (BLM and THF) to 75 with various sub jobs.

We have all been told that SE and the STF are all reading these fourms but yet no offical response from SE other than a pre canned statement from May 2007....I realize that we are in different time zones but WAKE UP SE!! it is Dec 2007!!! There has been no helping hand offered to those who have retrieved their accounts or better yet no offical word to even help those that have not recieved their accounts back...Unacceptable...oh wait a minute SE has released a statment that their cracker jack legal team is looking at suing some of the RMT companies that may be responsible for the recent rash of hacks....and who does that help again??? Gee I wonder who would get the winnings from that settlement??

Like most of you I have grown addicted to this game over the years (my wife got me hooked) and most recently I have come to realize that three years of leveling, farming, having some friends leave the game and some of their gear given to me. I will now have to start over minus the leveling part, just to get my THF back to somewhat decent gear it will cost me approx four million gil. Unless I am willing to go buy gil (which I am not) than I am looking at another 4-8 months just to get back to somewhere half decent for one of my two main jobs.

Being that this happened to me on Dec.6 it will soon be time to pay a 1 month fee for Dec. for having the luxry of logging into Whitegate and do nothing more than wait and see if SE will provide any assistance or at this point even make a statement. For those that say why not have gear/gil loaned to you? (which I have been but I declined) Well with no offical word from SE on the situation what assurances do we have that it won&apos;t happen again and any gear/gil I borrow from LS or friends.... if I am hacked again what do you say to those people who loaned it to you?

Well if I am going to have to start over , I started looking at other alternatives...why not right? but...WOW I find to cartoonish (that&apos;s just me) I could sit here and list all the others but in short SE knows that Fans of FFXI are hardcore and they sit there knowing they offer something fairly unique in the MMORPG space...but do they??

I found this...it is not launched yet but it&apos;s close:

Aion&quot;Tower of Eternity&quot;

The point is.... SE if you read these posts....get off your butts and respond there are over 150 affected players listed here and 2500+ worldwide and counting that we know of, I am sure there are more. You are not the only game in town and considering what I just listed above and the sheer numbers and current frustration level I am confident we could contact their developers or PR dept very easily at this stage of their development. I imagine they would love to hear our story, concerns and suggestions for mechnasims we would like to see in their upcoming release (Petition written by Kisada would be very easy to forward on to them) which would entice us to come over. We would have to wait for their release?...oh and how long will it be before you make this situation right with all of us? That&apos;s if you do anything at all other than sue other companies for your own gain? Give you some time? and how many months should we continue paying you while you think about what you will do.... if anything at all.

Correct me if I am wrong but their is no fee to join these fourms is there? So SE/STF if you are reading these fourms..register..respond and at least let us know you hear us and are concerned...otherwise read above. I just gave everyone here an alternative :) nyphani 12-22-2007, 11:24 AM As most of you know, I like everyone here had my account hijacked, before I begin my heart goes out to all of you that have not been able to get your accounts back and I can only hope that SE will make it right!!

Hi Nyphani

I don&apos;t know if it was luck or if the hacker who had my account was just too busy trying to sell off all my stuff but he didn&apos;t change the CC info and I had my character kicked by a UK repersentive at 10:30 am est and had him change my password...I had to wait till 12:00 PM est to call in to POL North America support to get it back but the hacker had my account for just over 12 hours before I was able to get him kicked so I guess I was lucky he didn&apos;t change the info danoob 12-22-2007, 12:57 PM Metalmyth. Can you please go somewhere else with your sob story&quot;SE hates us&quot;.


First off just because you got hacked and they took your stuff, doesnt mean SE should be able to promptly take all that stuff back from the people who bought it and give it back. That would open up the world to a whole lot of&quot;hackings&quot;every time someone regrets trading/selling something. Surely you can understand that.

I am pretty sure SE has acknowledged the issue and are working on restoring accounts, And yet you insist on calling them liars. You need to take a step back and realise it was your own stupidity and/or ignorance that caused this. NOT SE. Sure you can be pissed at them but to bring that sob story here is annoying and just screams how stupid you are.

Have a nice day.

P.S. Maybe you should ask your new game CS, if that you are stupid enough to allow someone to get your user info and steal your stuff, will they take it back from who they sold it to and give it back to you. I guess what I am saying is make sure the new game you choose is idiot proof so you do not lose 3 years worth of work again. Koyuki 12-22-2007, 01:05 PM Metalmyth.

danoob

I have already shut you down numerous times in this thread...Facts about danoob:

1.) You haven&apos;t been hacked.

2.) You haven&apos;t been able to provide any of us here help

3.) No constructive suggestions or for that matter facts as to what actually happened (&quot;I am pretty sure SE has acknowledged the issue&quot;).....whatever

You have provided nothing but finger pointing and heresy, you are not a representative from SE so stop trying to pretend you are one, As for taking back items...go check and see how WOW deals with similar situations when it occurs. The fact is you have no clue about what can or cannot be done.

As for your comment&quot;And yet you insist on calling them liars&quot;where did SE acknowledge officially the situation at hand...they haven&apos;t so how can anything I have said be considered calling them liars? I have never stated that, so stop putting words in my mouth.

as for your childish comments:

&quot;stupid enough to allow someone to get your user info and steal your stuff&quot;

So everyone here is stupid? I don&apos;t think so...newsflash not everyone here may be so called computer experts, but if we all have computers, and FFXI accounts it means we all have some form of disposable income and would have lost everything to hackers long ago. I would have to believe we are all smart enough to know the basics of protecting ourselves online.

BTW how do you know how it was obtained? maybe I am wrong about you trying to be an SE representative and are one of the actual hackers hence the reason every single post you have made blames the paying customer......so I apologize as you would know how it was done ...before you post we are not interested in your assumptions...show us facts

You are turning me into Shumue. You are the retard who installed a Keylogger and didnt have a firewall to stop it. Therefor you are the retard who gave your account away.

By the way someone hacked my account and sold all my crystals for 1 gil a stack.

Can a GM please give me all my crystals back

(P.S. I didnt really get hacked, I just didnt really think someone would bid 1 gil for all my crystals, but dont tell the GM that, I was clearly hacked)

And for the record until the last month 90% of the hackings in FFXI where stupid people giving out their info to&quot;friends&quot;Correct me if I am wrong but pretty sure GM&apos;s have better things to do then to investigate every&quot;hacking&quot;report.

Metal: Glad you got your char back, sucks it was raped. I know if I was in your shoes I&apos;d quit. There&apos;s no way I&apos;d go through everything I&apos;ve been through to get the items I have now a second time. 1st time is a challenge, anything else is just painful. Talk about a bittersweet victory. :? Kimmie 12-22-2007, 03:21 PM Congratulations Metalmyth on getting your account back! I&apos;m a little surprised that you didn&apos;t check the CC before though o.O. And uh, I tend to just read posts, but honestly, can someone get Danoob off the thread? Trolling is really unnecessary for this topic. None of us want to hear it. Infini 12-22-2007, 06:11 PM Nuke danoob prz hes trolling a serious topic for us all! -_- Metalmyth 12-22-2007, 06:35 PM I apologize in advance to everyone, I was hacked on the evening of Dec.6 at 9:10 PM EST. At 10:30 am EST on Dec.7 I was finally able to get thru to the UK web chat of POL a UK rep listened to my story...verified all my information and booted my charcter and changed the password. At 12:00 PM EST (9:00 AM PST) I was able to get thru to North American POL support and had my account back. But all the damage was done during the 13 hours the hacker had my account

Again I apologize if anyone here thought I didn&apos;t have my account, I though my intial post showed that, I wasn&apos;t trying to mislead anyone that I no longer had my account. My account is basically useless but even though I have my account I feel the bigger issue is for SE:

1.) Restore accounts to their rightful owners first and foremost

2.) SE needs to launch an offical investigation

3.) At the conclusion of the investigation restore the items that were taken from their rightful owners

So in a nutshell I have been at point 3 since Dec.7, I feel for every person here who still doesn&apos;t have their account back and I can&apos;t possibly imagine your anger. After point 1 and 2 have been addressed I fully expect SE to address point 3 for all of us, but as it has been stated many times on this thread our greatest strength is in our sheer numbers so I keep pushing along with everyone else here to get SE to at least start with point 1.

Thank you again Kisada!!! Lindstrom 12-22-2007, 09:12 PM Talaquen on Midgardsormr was hacked and moved to Kujata, which is kinda weird since it&apos;s a character I inherited from the original player like a year ago, basically shared between me, my brother, and 2 of my friends. Pretty regularly kept the password changed, even weirder is our mains weren&apos;t touched and Talaquen had nothing of sellable value aside from a Blau Dolch and a SH+1. Also had 100 leathercraft, mostly used him for that, TH in certain situations, and holding King Vinegarroon. Gonna try to make a quick mule on Kujata and see if the name was changed. Pretty bummed about losing him, if anyone on Kujata sees a goofy looking Elvaan THF with the&quot;there&apos;s something about Mary&quot;hair, a Perseus Harpe, Trotter Boots, and leathercraft shit lemme know I guess :/


Oh yeah we noticed something was really fishy (aside from our PW being wrong) when someone bought shit for those Aqueducts Subligar quests as him yesterday which was pretty odd.

Edit: too lazy to read this whole thread since it&apos;s really fucking long but how would I go about getting him removed from my credit card? Guessing call SE or the credit card people, but if there is an easier, faster method I can do myself I&apos;m interested. Tlieaxu 12-22-2007, 09:21 PM if he is still on your credit card, SE will reset your password and you can get it back, if not, then it already should not charge to your account. SE won&apos;t do anything if you don&apos;t have the current credit card on file, name on account, date of birth, address. Goodluck. Lindstrom 12-22-2007, 09:31 PM Thanks. Also a heads up to people on Kujata his name wasn&apos;t changed, still Talaquen and I saw that he&apos;s in Ifrit&apos;s Cauldron, probably doing gilseller things, which is kind of ironic since the original player and I used to MPK gilsellers in Kuftal all the time. Indalecia 12-22-2007, 10:29 PM Dude, Lind, check your computer and stuff. We don&apos;t need gillies with fucking 9 pieces of Salvage gear running around. And if you stopped doing Virtus updates I&apos;d lose alot of entertainment value too. :( Lindstrom 12-23-2007, 12:04 AM I&apos;m not too too worried about our characters, we have way too much shit to skip over any possible threats and we update our passwords regularly.

Also I haven&apos;t updated the front page cuz I&apos;ve been working overtime and no one pays me to draw. Plus with Talaquen gone, we had the Salvage group all random and lowest lot has to level THF to 75 in like a month. I rolled a 16. seph32 12-23-2007, 03:59 AM idk if this has anything to do with hacked accounts but...
I recently noticed http://www.ffxiah.com/item.php?id=15327&amp;sid=29
fumas drasticly decreased in price ever since the hacking account began. They used to be 200-250k now they are barely 60k. Now I&apos;m not sure of it but hacked accounts by RMTs may be used for spamming certain BCs. Just a thought. Rena 12-23-2007, 06:59 AM RMT have been messing with the price on fumas for a long time now, nothing out of the ordinary. Claudussssss 12-23-2007, 09:16 AM Where do you check if a account is activated or not? blister1 12-23-2007, 04:58 PM Metalmyth. Can you please go somewhere else with your sob story&quot;SE hates us&quot;.


First off just because you got hacked and they took your stuff, doesnt mean SE should be able to promptly take all that stuff back from the people who bought it and give it back. That would open up the world to a whole lot of&quot;hackings&quot;every time someone regrets trading/selling something. Surely you can understand that.

I am pretty sure SE has acknowledged the issue and are working on restoring accounts, And yet you insist on calling them liars. You need to take a step back and realise it was your own stupidity and/or ignorance that caused this. NOT SE. Sure you can be pissed at them but to bring that sob story here is annoying and just screams how stupid you are.

Have a nice day.

P.S. Maybe you should ask your new game CS, if that you are stupid enough to allow someone to get your user info and steal your stuff, will they take it back from who they sold it to and give it back to you. I guess what I am saying is make sure the new game you choose is idiot proof so you do not lose 3 years worth of work again.

Why hasn&apos;t this faggot been banned yet? :rocl: setzor 12-23-2007, 06:12 PM Seems this thread has become majorly derailed with petty arguments about shittalk.

What about the issue at hand, it appears we&apos;ve still not heard anything openly official from SE.

This&quot;calm&quot;period after the major influx of lost accounts is kinda uncomforting. I mean it might be showing that SE has gotten to the root of the issue, and are just trying to think about how to correct the problem without affecting game balance. Also, could be trying to figure out how exactly they are gonna let people prove they own the accounts. It&apos;s obvious to us, but then again, we&apos;re kinda looking at it from only a couple angles. They have to approach it from all angles..

Whatever the case, as time goes on, without anything being said, I get more and more in denial of getting my taru back, and it&apos;s thoroughly pissing me off. I imagine this frustration I&apos;m feeling would be much like trying to teach a blind person how to play dr. mario.

anyway,

just my thoughts for the day,

--Setzor. ronin sparthos 12-23-2007, 06:21 PM Heres to hoping SE gives all the hacked people a &apos;Christmas Gift&apos; in the form of our accounts back the way we left them... Mystics 12-23-2007, 07:00 PM Why do i have a feelin we prob wont get them back till somewhere in January after they notice the amount of money spent has decreased a lot (assuming the RMT&apos;s will drop all Characters from the CC currently on the accounts) especially with the number of characters. (100 Solo Characters = $1,300.00 That adds up n with the proclaimed 2,500 Characters missing including the mules the money is up there and is noticeable.)

Not saying the RMT will drop all characters 8 out of 10 they might try keep the most lethal characters to keep them farming until they get banned.

But not to down anyone I do hope we get them back before Christmas but thats wishful thinking. Lordender 12-23-2007, 07:20 PM Why do i have a feelin we prob wont get them back till somewhere in January after they notice the amount of money spent has decreased a lot (assuming the RMT&apos;s will drop all Characters from the CC currently on the accounts) especially with the number of characters.

SE will use the holidays as an excuse as why they moved slow even though this started around the end of nov-beginning of december. Typical SE the way this being handled, taking almost a month now with no public statement about what their going to be doing and how soon people can expect to see their accounts returned through password resets.

Not good enough in my book, this is an issue that needed a fast response is taking weeks now. Kanachan 12-23-2007, 08:28 PM Think I found MD, http://www.ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1110872 @Odin

Sold a bunch of stuff I was holding onto/using.

Can anyone from there give me some insight into some of the stuff he&apos;s doing? Metalmyth 12-23-2007, 10:35 PM Hi All

I found this while pouring over Playonline&apos;s website to see if there has been any kind of mention or even some form of a statement:

http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff ... etail.html (http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/2701/detail.html)

Quote:

&quot;Unauthorized Access

In the past, we have warned users of the dangers of spyware being used to achieve unauthorized account access. User claims persist, however, detailing instances of character and account victimization, traces of access by unknown parties, etc.
In order to further the safety of the PlayOnline experience, we urge users to implement the following precautionary measures whenever possible:

- Do not access websites with unknown or suspicious content.
- Do not download software from unknown or suspicious websites.
- Periodically perform Windows Updates and keep Windows updated to the latest version.
*Refer to Microsoft&apos;s official website for more detailed information.
- Periodically update your web browser to the latest version.
- Do not use external tools not approved by Square Enix under any circumstances.
- Always use the latest antivirus software and Internet security software.

Most importantly, we ask that users maintain the utmost security with regards to their PlayOnline IDs and passwords. We would also like to assure our users that under no circumstances has SQUARE ENIX divulged any of their personal information to third parties at any time.
Users should also confirm that their Windows and internet environments are running under adequate safety&quot;

I find this to be nothing more than a way for SE to wash their hands of any accountability...worded nicely but the overall message remains the same. (In case your wondering this is buried within the Dec.19 STF report so it&apos;s not really frontpage so to speak)

I can&apos;t remeber if I read it on this thread or in another forum, but it was said that SE was pursuing legal action against one of the popular RMT websites in connection with some of the recent stolen accounts. As it is not officially posted my guess (and again it is only a guess at this point) is that SE somehow traced back the changed Credit Card info on one of the stolen accounts to an employee of an online RMT website.

If true, this would only really benefit SE as it would be a lump sum cash settlement and one less RMT website for SE to worry about, you can be sure it would be spun differently as SE helping it&apos;s paying customers blah blah. My problem with all this...if true is that it leaves people like&quot;Setzor&quot;and many others on this thread not knowing what is going on one way or the other.

I realize that the majority of my posts could be viewed as negative against SE (I perfer passionate :) ) or I could be even viewed as a conspiracy theorist of sorts, but as an example of where my frustration comes from, in the very same report I quoted above if you read towards the bottom you will find this jem:

Quote:

&quot;- Are people involved in purchasing RMT gil and items able to avoid punishment by using multiple accounts and feigning ignorance of the source of the gil/items?

All in-game activity is recorded in temporary logs (*4). The Special Task Force uses these logs to track the movement of illegal gil and items, which allows us to discern not only the accounts involved in the initial transaction, but also the accounts that are the ultimate recipients of RMT services.
As well as the use of multiple accounts, we have seen various other methods with which people attempt to evade culpability; however, there is no escape from the data trail left in our logs.&quot;

So let me get this straight in my own head SE..... if something affects your bottom line (as you would not get a cut from RMT&apos;s selling gil/items) you have this cracker jack team that can pour over logs and leave no stone unturned.

But a paying customer...who has been paying with the same Credit Card for years, one day suddenly changes their CC info...sells every single valuable item he/she has, transfers all that gil to some level 1 character (with questionable ties) and you have reports being made in real time that same said account has been stolen/hacked...but you no way to verify any of this???

Is it just me??? Kurokikaze 12-23-2007, 11:00 PM And for the record until the last month 90% of the hackings in FFXI where stupid people giving out their info to&quot;friends&quot;Correct me if I am wrong but pretty sure GM&apos;s have better things to do then to investigate every&quot;hacking&quot;report.

LOL You&apos;re a fucking moron. Wow someone ban this guy already.

Yep thats SE alright... They are really slow on the uptake. This matter isn&apos;t going to get resolved until everyone that has had their POL account stolen calls Info Center and spam emails their execs (try person that Bercus was interviewing about future updates through emails before Ulli got fixed) day in and day out voicing their concerns. grover 12-23-2007, 11:25 PM Honestly, I don&apos;t expect any news until after the new year. Maybe I&apos;m just a pessimist, but I have a feeling that SE will wait and see if the RMT credit card info is good, and only return those accounts that aren&apos;t being paid for.

I&apos;ve asked the POL helpdesk operators, but they wouldn&apos;t tell me if my character was still on Hades, and as far as I can tell, none of my lol&quot;High end gear&quot;is being sold on Hades AH according to ffxiah.com, so I dunno what has happened to my account.

Even if I get my toon back, still not sure if I would return...

/endrandomrant Mystics 12-24-2007, 01:01 AM Grover u could possibly b on Titan or Bahamut if they didnt change ur name its a pretty common name they had 7 servers that had a Grover history but the 2 active n those 2 are titan and bahamut grover 12-24-2007, 03:12 AM Grover u could possibly b on Titan or Bahamut if they didnt change ur name its a pretty common name they had 7 servers that had a Grover history but the 2 active n those 2 are titan and bahamut

Is there a way to check for your toon&apos;s name across other servers on ffxiah.com? None of my mule&apos;s, or Grover have any transactions since my account was jacked. The only gear I had worth selling would be HQ Staffs, but those seem to be only sold by WW mules on Hades. Tlieaxu 12-24-2007, 03:48 AM I haven&apos;t seen Nyphani or Tlieaxu since our accounts were taken also not seen our mules, there is someone selling our stuff and only our stuff however on ffxiah.com name algut so far been selling all my HQ elemental staves, other blm gear, nin gear and cor gear. Also selling a lot of Nyph&apos;s drk and mnk gear, never sold a thing until after our accounts were taken and only sold our stuff, he speaks broken english and basically admitted to it to a friend of ours and still nobody has done anything on SEs end. Considering they claim they can see all the logs and can track things, they are doing a pretty damn bad job at doing it. Jeny 12-24-2007, 04:32 AM Can anyone confirm if these mules belong to real players?

Theres multiple characters named Iii on a couple of servers with a bunch of random other level 1&apos;s to their name.

Iii
Pheonix. Other mules: Play, Qwer, Topp, Graywolf, Wea
Titan. Other mules: Aaa, Uuu, Eee
Fairy. Other mules: Vvmax
Ramuh. Other mules: Setu, Jiru,
Valefor. Other mules: Kii, Wii, Eii, Gii, Oii
Bahamut
Seraph
Ifrit

Iii on Lakshmi was was one of the mules that took my gear the day I was hacked. Just wanting to know if theres any relation between any of these as well.

Nyphani is no longer on Titan. I wasn&apos;t able to send her an item thru mogmail. :/ The same thing happened to Livinlegend. The RMTs have either moved both characters off of the server or deleted them. Nicblue has been combing the usual sites for an account like Livinlegend&apos;s to pop up for sale. I&apos;ll tell him to keep a look out for a character that looks like Nyphani.

Tlieaxu is still there, however. Vilhem 12-24-2007, 08:20 AM Livin&apos;s character is no longer on Titan as of Monday morning :/ Posting some information about his chara, hopefully someone on another server will notice him

Hume male - Face 4B
Jobs: DRG, WHM, WAR, PLD
Notables: wyvern&apos;s name Darug-Borug, Ares body, Ares legs, Ace&apos;s helm, Love Torque, Cleric&apos;s pantaloons, 100 Bonecraft (might be selling a Dragon Harness +1, he was trying to sell one a day before his account was taken)

If anyone sees this chara, or one you suspect is him, please SS and let us know ;-; ahnalia 12-24-2007, 10:38 AM Beware of searching through RMT sites. A friend of mine who doesn&apos;t play FFXI,is helping me do some research on this problem, did some looking around at various FFXI and RMT websites, he visited:
KI, Alla, ffxiah, and somepage, IGE, ThSale and IGEX websites,(we picked the most popular sites to check) he found a trojan on the system he used to visit these pages. It&apos;s call Trojan.Dumaru and it is a keylogger, (detectable and cleanable by spyware doctor) (AVG did not detect it.)
I also noticed that several questionable people who have recently popped up on seraph have bazaar comments that have advertisements for&quot;HNMLS&quot;linkshells and have URL&apos;s included.
Odd thing about it was they were on seraph, and advertising for a ls on titan called&quot;peaches&quot;and they were all /anon farming amemet.
I&apos;m not trying to brainstorm here, but the thought did occur to me that they might be using new webpages to entice players to come visit since most people caught on to the other pages that were being exploited.
I mean, at this point, you can&apos;t really underestimate their means to get gil. Kyreth 12-24-2007, 12:08 PM system he used to visit these pages. It&apos;s call Trojan.Dumaru and it is a keylogger, (detectable and cleanable by spyware doctor) (AVG did not detect it.)

First they use a mis-spelled&quot;Microsoft&quot;site, now they have a off-by-one Domaru trojan?

Someone has a sick sense of humor. nyphani 12-24-2007, 12:12 PM there is someone selling our stuff and only our stuff however on ffxiah.com name algut so far been selling all my HQ elemental staves, other blm gear, nin gear and cor gear. Also selling a lot of Nyph&apos;s drk and mnk gear

you werent paying attention when i showed you, were you?&gt;.&gt;he hasnt sold your HQ staves yet, tho there have been other funny looking mules that have sold hq staves, i dont think they were yours. Alg has sold mostly Tli&apos;s NIN and BLM gear, a bit of COR(lvl 60), and most of my DRK gear with a bit of PLD(lvl 60, with some 50-40 lvl cap gear). he also said he has my plastron for sale, it hasnt sold on AH yet tho. :( i havent seen him sell any of my MNK gear yet, most of it was rare/ex except some 50 cap gear and gaurd skill up junk. i also have a lvl 66 BLM that i havent seen him sell junk from either yet. but still so far everything that he&apos;s sold was something me and tli had.


Nyphani is no longer on Titan. I wasn&apos;t able to send her an item thru mogmail. :/ The same thing happened to Livinlegend.

I&apos;ll tell him to keep a look out for a character that looks like Nyphani.

never thought of that as a way to check, good idea :/ for anyone checking other servers or chara sales:

Nyphani, Mithra: face 6-B
Jobs: DRK,MNK75, BLM66, WHM42, THF,WAR,NIN,RDM37, others all less then 37. All jobs unlocked, cept WotG(luckly, didnt buy expantion yet :/ ).
Rare/EX gear: Shura legs/body/head, Pahluwan legs/body/head, MNK AFv2 5/5, Black Belt, Swift Belt, Ethereal/Fenrir&apos;s/Abyssal/Brutal Earrings, Ohat, Rajas/Ulthalam&apos;s Rings, Walahra Turban, Dune boots, DRK AFv2 4/5(no head), DRK AF+1 head/gloves/feet, Royal Army Mantal, Bibiki Seashell, Trollbane, Flame Gorget, Snow Gorget, other stuff but nomore that id think that would be useful at 75.
Rank 10 Bastok, Rank 8 San d&apos;Oria, done all missions(cept WotG)
Cooking lvl 60, Goldsmithing 52? others 10 or below i think, fishing might be 14?
Bazzar comment has a quote from Zied.. ummm cant think of anything else that could be useful.. x.x

oh, other chara on my acct is Ronsard, male Hume face 1-A, lvl 60PLD, 37WAR rank 5 Sandy, no real notable equipment cept AF. Has a Sandy aketon, suppose thats sellable tho. Bazzar comment is a quote from Spirrow Avendale. Doubt GS would use this chara for anything, but i suppose it might be advertised if anyone trys to sell the acct?

other mules are Rrosa(F1-A, 23WHM, Bastokan Aketon, and yes 2 R&apos;s), and Dogger(F7-B?, Windy Aketon). Ruin 12-24-2007, 12:57 PM system he used to visit these pages. It&apos;s call Trojan.Dumaru and it is a keylogger, (detectable and cleanable by spyware doctor) (AVG did not detect it.)

Just scanned with Spyware Doctor, and a threat name: backdoor.Rbot.AEU came up. Anyone know of this one? Is explained as a trojan that attempts to access you&apos;re computer. Concerned about it but Doctor costs 40$ to install and you have to type in visa card# which I would rather not do on computer... ahnalia 12-24-2007, 02:06 PM Backdoor.Rbot.AEU is a backdoor trojan which opens network ports and attempts to allow an attacker unauthorized access to the infected machine without users knowledge.
There is a free copy of spyware doctor that you can get, but I can&apos;t recall the download URL right off hand, sorry :(
They kinda keep it quiet it seems lol.
I found it when I tried to uninstall the trial version (I didn&apos;t want to pay 40.00 either) and this website popped up and gave details of the freeware version.
I like it, my slow little computer can run it while I play FFXI and it found a few things adaware and windows defender didn&apos;t.
Heres what I found about your trojan:

Backdoor.Rbot.AEU
Type Malware
Type Description Malware (&quot;malicious software&quot;) consists of software with clearly malicious, hostile, or harmful functionality or behavior and that is used to compromise and endanger individual PCs as well as entire networks.

A Backdoor compromises system integrity by making changes to the system that allow it to by used by the attacker for malicious purposes unknown to the user.
Level High
Level Description High risks are typically installed without user interaction through security exploits, and can severely compromise system security. Such risks may open illicit network connections, use polymorphic tactics to self-mutate, disable security software, modify system files, and install additional malware. These risks may also collect and transmit personally identifiable information (PII) without your consent and severely degrade the performance and stability of your computer.

I know hindsight is 20/20, etc.

I&apos;m sad to see you both gone. Best of luck in recovering your shit! ronin sparthos 12-24-2007, 08:13 PM Issue is we dont use the same computer, nor did we have the same trojans affect us.

Everything was spaced out so there wasnt any magic bullet that woulda saved me, tis a pity.

The trojan that slipped into my PC was relatively new, so new that AVG and and Kaspersky cant deal with it yet. Fortunately one EU scanner could deal with it, too bad that was after the fact.

Oh well, i&apos;ll go look for Spar on the AH site while i wait for SE to do something besides dick around. You&apos;d think 2400 accounts would warrant swift action.... guess not.

Edit1: Kerra is holding me/kanachan and jeny&apos;s name on his account i hear, so if you see noobs with our names running around its him.

If I remember correctly, it was Sys32/bho.abo - and there was a file called cmcfg3.dll in system32 folder. (Not to be mistaken with cmcfg32.dll.)

Edit
Also, please, if anyone sees my boyfriend&apos;s character, please let us know.&gt;&lt;Here&apos;s a recent screenshot of his BRD the day he got Marduk&apos;s Shalwar. RMT will probably buy an Errant body and use that combo...

I think I might have gotten hacked too around the same time, but I can&apos;t say for sure yet as I&apos;m across the country. :\ Was logged into POL all the way up until I left for my flight and I didn&apos;t get booted out. I wrote down my POL password before I left and haven&apos;t been able to log in via Friend List Plus or their new account management page; going to call tomorrow to see if my credit card information is still the same. My password&apos;s pretty ridiculous so I&apos;m hoping I wrote it down wrong, as I browse the web with Opera and regularly scan my system and found nothing all the way up until I left. Soulrunner 12-25-2007, 10:39 AM Nothing makes me sadder than seeing all these names, just the other day I observed a train of hacked players being escorted to an xp camp in Bhaflau thickets to level Jobs that RMT can use rather than the jobs those players had played. It&apos;s sick and demented but what did you expect. I&apos;ve seen this move coming, it started when Square Enix first cracked down on the Lucrative Gil Trade, Gil is one of the most valuable game currencies because of it&apos;s rarity, and FFXI is a goldmine thanks to the overly apathic majority among it&apos;s populus. They can hack and trade freely because unlike other mmo&apos;s this game is all about the player, it is built to discourage egocentrism yet people care more for themselves than the community still.

What these individuals are victims of is not a money making scheme, it&apos;s a war, a fight, a Blackmail attempt against SE. RMT are saying the players are the companies income, if SE does not want rmt then RMT will destroy SE. You are victims of a power struggle between the In game mafia, and the Game&apos;s legitimate legal owners. And SE cannot and will not as they have said bow down to the rmt. They don&apos;t want to appear soft, and surrender is not in thier language literally. I expect RMT to continue this they will try to completely subvert the game to make it an example to other mmo&apos;s on what happens when you cross them, and they will make a profit at the same time.

The only way to survive is to tuck in and pray you don&apos;t get taken in the middle of this enormous poo flinging contest. I&apos;ve completely removed my xbox from the network it has it&apos;s own separate dsl line, both my laptop and desktop have no internet access except when being used, when unused the internet is disconnected and the pc is fully scanned with Avast, Adaware, Spybot S&amp;D, and whatever other nasty things I find to counter rmt with. I run Zone Alarm firewall at all times at maximum strength, it has blocked over 25k outside access attempts since it was installed after my last reformat in October. Protect yourself, and if you love this game don&apos;t give up on it, do what you have to.

To the victims I express my deepest sympathy I hope one day you return safely, we all miss you, and hope this ends soon. Manalek 12-25-2007, 11:28 AM Manalek (75 SAM/MNK/NIN) has finally been moved off of Bismarck. If you see my sexy Elvaan, give that RMT slut hell!!! Ruin 12-25-2007, 02:22 PM Issue is we dont use the same computer, nor did we have the same trojans affect us.

Everything was spaced out so there wasnt any magic bullet that woulda saved me, tis a pity.

The trojan that slipped into my PC was relatively new, so new that AVG and and Kaspersky cant deal with it yet. Fortunately one EU scanner could deal with it, too bad that was after the fact.


So none of the most recent hackings are anything to do with the original 4 files that were named the cause?

Is there any 100% way to protect urself atm? Like say rmt did get ur POL ID and password, but you removed the &apos;virus&quot;and changed password on a console system. Or do you need to disable ffxi entirely on your computer to be fully safe ? Im just curious on people thoughts on how to be 100% safe of hacking. ahnalia 12-25-2007, 04:29 PM Ever since this happened, I have been downloading and testing every free spyware and anti-virus program I can find. Me and my friend have spent countless hours visiting ffxi related websites, including gilselling sites. The trojans we keep finding are definately coming from rmt websites at this point. As it stand I am currently running AVG, Spydoctor, and Avira, ontop of adaware, and windows defender, and all of them keeping finding something different.
Also have confirmed my earlier suspicions about the URL&apos;s I have seen in RMT bazaar&apos;s.
They are rigged with trojans =/
I think at this point all players should tighten the security on their systems as much as possible, and run a scan daily before they even log in.
It sucks to be so paranoid, but at this point there isn;t much else we can do.
And stay on SE&apos;s butt to do something about getting the stolen accounts returned, and changing some of their policy&apos;s.
Sure, it wasn&apos;t their fault anyone picked up a keylogger, but it is their fault for not having some sort of.. fail safe if you will, of people being able to go in and arbritrarily change vital information so... easily.
Be very very careful everyone, there seems to be a new wave of keyloggers floating around.
On a side note, I would just like to take a moment to /slap all the virtual currency buyers who keep these parasites in business. I can&apos;t wait till they hack YOUR account and take back all the gil you bought. ahnalia 12-25-2007, 05:23 PM You should be pretty safe, yeah. Nothing is 100% at this point, but with the right precautions there&apos;s no reason to not log on and enjoy the game. Infini 12-25-2007, 05:36 PM Pity we cant just hit THEM with a DDoS attack the likes noone has ever seen theyre well overdue for payback from the DDoS against FFXI from 2 years ago c.c Skycaptain 12-25-2007, 05:51 PM I&apos;m running
1. I.E.Pro for IE7,
2. Spywaredoctor the registered version,
3. a custom host file from----&gt;here (http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm)
4. Another helpful little goodie is a program called Enditall I check my running processes every time I boot my machine.

I have several others but I find if you check enditall every time you start you box and familiarize yourself with the running processes, when they change you will instantly notice. I.E. pro caught the I frame on the somepage sight and it also notified me of something on the portal site for linkshell community that looked suspicious so I didn&apos;t let it install and left without entering my U-name or P-word. You don&apos;t need a ton of crap on your computer if you know what needs to run and what doesn&apos;t.

I really hope SE steps up to the plate and restore the accounts that have been taken. I just don&apos;t think people will want to spend 2-4 years developing a character just to loose it to rmt. The whole player base is watching to see what SE will do. ahnalia 12-25-2007, 06:31 PM I&apos;m pretty impressed with spyware doctor at this point. It runs nicely in the background and doesn&apos;t lag me out while I&apos;m on the game. Gaiden 12-25-2007, 10:09 PM Kammi female taru - Unicorn server

From Kammi - Caught from spyware doctor: Trojan-Spy.Delf.UC under the registry key SOFTWARE\Tencent
Description: Trojan.Spy.Delf.UC open ports and allows attackers unauthorized access to an infected machine. It also monitors and logs keystrokes.

How it was obtained? No clue yet. Kammi was not able to regain control of the account, as if you do a search, there was a background check on this particular player. It was a purchased account awhile ago that transferred to Unicorn. She was unable to regain control, but the help desk was able to cancel her POL ID, content IDs, and prohibit the charge to her credit card. She did not have the POL reg code, so was denied by the help desk the password reset.

This reminded me of a conversation that happened at the Fan Festival.

It appears that I should be able to freeze my account according to the 2nd response that was left. However when I call the information center, they said that they didn&apos;t have this power :roll: They said they would flag my account and call me back later......they said this one before when I first told them my account was stolen, and they never called. It seems like communication is very bad within SE.

Complaint
Complaint Classification: Ad Practices

Complaint Description - Posted 12-14-2007


There recently has been a rise in the number of FFXI accounts that have been stolen due to a keylogger virus on one of the FFXI sites as mentioned in the following forum: viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=27226 (http://bluegartr.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=27226) Due to this, my account has been stolen from me. The person who stole my account went in and changed my password, address, and credit card info. When I called SE playonline Customer Service, they said they couldn&apos;t fix the issue because I couldn&apos;t provide the new address or credit card info. This doesn&apos;t make sense to me since the person who stole my account changed it (probably because they know SE policy). I could however provide the credit card info for the past 18 months, the previous address, the name and birthdate and other info such as the original Playonline registration code to them, but they said this wasn&apos;t enough. So there seems like little hope for me to get my account back. I don&apos;t see how past credit card history etc. doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t own the account. Why is SE allowing people to be ripped off and doing nothing to fix this?? I am out not just the 18 months of work I put into the character, but also the FFXI game itself, plus all the expansions because the registration codes are no longer valid since it is only one account per code.
Complaint Summary


I recently have had my FFXI account stolen from me and I am not getting the support I need to fix this.
Resolution Sought


First off i would like them to fix my account and restore my character back to me. My name is xxxx xxxxxxx and my playonline ID is xxxxxxxx. My email address is xxxxxxxxxx@hotmail.com and my phone number is xxx-xxx-xxxx. You must remember that my credit card info was also compromised since the person involved was able to check my information. I believe SE should also change their policy to make it tougher to change account holder info. Some other check that would make it more secure.

Company&apos;s Response
Initial Response - Posted 12-14-2007


We will not be able to allow access to this customers account as we can only verify the information that is currently on the account. We as a provider cannot prevent players from installing third party software on their machine, in this case an alleged key logger. We do leave account security up to the user. For us to allow access to a lost account, the customer would need to verify the information as it appears on the account. Without that information, no changes can be made.

Initial Response Summary


Security of the login information is left to the responsibility of the user.

Consumer&apos;s Rebuttal
Rebuttal - Posted 12-17-2007


I provided all account information when I setup the account. The person who stole the account changed the credit card info and address, but my name, dob, credit card history etc are still the same as when I setup the account. However SE does not look at past information to verify an account, they only look at current information. This makes no sense as the current information can be changed if the username/password is stolen. It would be like if I opened a credit card account, had my card stolen, but then the credit card company said well whoever has the credit card is the owner of the account. They should be able to verify the account using past payment history or original account info

We can only verify information that is currently on the account, and not by previous information. This is the reason why the security of the account being left to the responsibility of the user. We will not be able to grant access to any account without proper verification. We understand the customers frustration, we are continually looking for ways to improve the service that we provide our customers. Recently we added a policy that allows customers to have accounts that have been compromised frozen. For full details on this the customer can contact the PlayOnline Information Center. We hope this alternative will meet the customers needs regarding this issue. ronin sparthos 12-26-2007, 02:17 PM We can only verify information that is currently on the account, and not by previous information.

Is this for real? Or can they not see that their own reps refuse to having this sorta power? Verification my ass, the fucking codes that come in the box is the MASTER verification for whoever owns the account/s. The only way for someone to get that is to go dumpster diving or break into your house and STEAL IT.

SE doesnt even know its own policy at times, or the communication is really that bad. No wonder RMT are flocking to stealing from this game, the higher ups dont communicate with the low level employees is why. 2400 and im sure thats gone up to over 2500 now and SE still hasnt posted anything on there main pages about the nature of the possible trojans that could compromise you.

Their responsibility or not, something stinks - and they should be finding out just what that is. setzor 12-26-2007, 02:45 PM believe it or not, while i wouldn&apos;t like it, i&apos;d rather see a response from SE that goes something like this, than nothing at all:

SMN BLM WHM had all the af2 heads, was just a mule found the person who used it with the infected files and the files were deleted. Metalmyth 12-26-2007, 03:09 PM Good Afternoon Everyone

I guess like everyone else here I have hit my limit for frustration, although I still feel horrible for those who have not been able to get
their stolen accounts back. I feel the best way to make a stand is to raise eyebrows at a higher level finacally. Although I am sure my 14.95 a month won&apos;t kill them, I do strongly believe that if enough people were to start withholding their 14.00 - 16.00 a month x 2000 accounts a month (alot of people have 2-3 mule accounts as well) all of a sudden SE will take notice.

Biggest problem of course is how to get enough people behind you? At this point the online petitions, bad press, continus calls to both POL and GM&apos;s and even letters directly to the top brass we have access to, has produced very little other than silly statements from SE that either defend the policy or fingerpoint&quot;That is the policy and we are powerless to change it&quot;

Well a good percentage of people that have currently lost their accounts will be behind this wether they choose to or not (Whatever RMT CC info was used is more than likley not valid so SE will not get their payment for the month of Dec) As for people like myself that either were fortunate enough (if you want to use that word) were able to get their account back by having the charcter booted before the RMT changed the CC info or thru some other means, now have their account back but it is crippled. I see no reason why we should pay SE for an account that can no longer be used properly and continue to pay their monthly fee

What I would like to do is somehow cancel my account ...not delete it but cancel it so that when SE decides to address this issue properly (return stolen accounts, return stolen items, implement new policies that will help prevent this in the future) The problem I and others are faced with....no new policies from SE....what is to say it won&apos;t happen again in a couple of months? As of right now the answer will be&quot;you are SOL yet again&quot;As we have seen by&quot;Ronin&apos;s&quot;post who did know what was happening but had not been hacked was hit with a new keylogger so what are we to do...buy/download every single A/V program (as one does not seem to catch it all...be in the middle of a quest or EXP party and have to say&quot;brb have to go update my multiple A/V programs its been 2 hours now&quot;.


Personally I will remain activley involved in pressuring SE on the issue but I will be dammed if they will get my monthly fee, After SE address&apos;s this I can at that time reactivate my charcters account. I am pretty sure this can be done but as I have never been faced with this type of situation is there someone on these threads that has quit the game and then came back at a later time and reactivated their account...if so exactly what did you do? I believe you have two choices Cancel or Delete can someone please let me know.

Hi

Just so you know that the only way to freeze the account is if you have the current CC info, at least that was my situation personally. I was lucky enough that the hijacked had not changed my CC info but I was told by a GM directly after telling him the story via my wife&apos;s charcter while it was happening that he did not have the power to jail a charcter upon request to give us time to get this sorted out by POL during normal buisness hours...in other words&quot;too bad&quot;

Getting my charcter booted by a UK rep via a web chat (POL North American Office was not open at the time) I had to verify my CC info on file before he would boot the charcter and change the password. Point is that if the hacker changes the CC info on file you are SOL and the policy has not been changed this can be confirmed by Ronin on Dec.23 My thought would be if you can verify the current CC info on file they can boot ....if not...too bad, this is not a new policy, otherwise SE would have made an annoucement with the new policy to deal with all the fallout Catrina 12-26-2007, 03:49 PM The problem with the canceling the game to show anger is the fact that a lot of people are too hooked up in the game to be able to go through that (myself included, I&apos;m afraid), but what I do know is this: no way in hell will I allow myself to get sucked into another SE MMO if that&apos;s what we can expect from them. So,whatever lame MMO they&apos;re now producing, they can can count me out of it. This may hold true to a lot of people. I mean,do you really want to go through all of this again? JP onry release date, and whatever else they throw at us, like the worst customer support I&apos;ve ever seen? (I&apos;ve seen better customer support in social security offices, with job-secured state employees).

In short, with this stunt, SE may be chipping away their already small player base,who may decide to go elsewhere and give accordingly bad publicity to the people they know regarding SE&apos;s online product. Metalmyth 12-26-2007, 03:54 PM Stuff like this unfortunately cannot be made overnight. I, too, would like SE to release a statement, but at the time time they will probably have to have a bevy of lawyers to help draft it etc.

At this point, if you haven&apos;t been hacked, and you feel strongly enough to hurt SE, quit the game. If you don&apos;t, then don&apos;t. That&apos;s all you can really do at this point until they release something.

Hi Elphaba

I am not saying quit what I am saying is cancel...big difference, in other words you will have the option to reactivate your charcter at that time. Why should we the paying customer pay SE their monthly fee while they try and sort this out? To put it in context would you continue to pay your Electric Company if they had some problem that prevented them from providing electricity 30 days and could only provide it on the first monday of every month? Of course not, you would say cancel my service till you figure it out and you can be sure they would fix it pretty quick.

My point is why pay for an account that is crippled...give them some time, sort it out and when you get it figured out, let me know and at that time I will once again start paying my monthly fee Metalmyth 12-26-2007, 03:56 PM The problem with the canceling the game to show anger is the fact that a lot of people are too hooked up in the game to be able to go through that (myself included, I&apos;m afraid), but what I do know is this: no way in hell will I allow myself to get sucked into another SE MMO if that&apos;s what we can expect from them.

Hi Catrina

I agree with you and I am caught up in the game as well but are you willing to go in and play..possibly borrow gil from friends go through the process of getting your gear back possibly months of farming with no gurantees you will not be right back where you are right now? Mystics 12-26-2007, 03:59 PM ICR Lea W: Hello, Devon, thank you for contacting the PlayOnline Information Center. Just a few moments while I review your question, please.
ICR Lea W: No, we cannot&quot;lock&quot;compromised accounts if someone calls in. However, if the authorities contact us regarding an official investigation something may be done. However, by then it is handled outside of this department, so I could not inform you of the exact workings of the procedure.
Mystics: i see
Mystics: hrmmm can i ask a question or 2? something has been on my mind
ICR Lea W: Of course, you may ask a question.
Mystics: when will the next billing take place again? Just a thought that all the accounts hijacked CC will most likely be invalid well the charecter that aren&apos;t much use to the RMT will these character&apos;s be deleted even if they have been reported stolen?
Mystics: Im forseeing a huge drop in the sales because of this..
ICR Lea W: Billing always takes place on the first of each month. If there is a valid credit card on the account, we will attempt to bill. If it gets declined for any reason, the account will go into cancellation.
Mystics: so nothing will be done if they were reported as hijacked if the character was canceled?
ICR Lea W: As I mentioned, we urge anyone who was keylogged to report the occurrence to their local authorities and have them contact us in the course of an official investigation.
Mystics: I see ok thank u for answerinf my questions
Mystics: umm do yall flag accounts that have been reported or is that a different group like STF? thats my last question
ICR Lea W: We do note on the account that it has possibly been compromised for future reference, yes.
ICR Lea W: Are there any other issues I can assist you with right now, Devon?
Mystics: i see well thank u for answering my questions yall might be getting calls from me in the future keeping up with this forum to see if anythings going to happen thx again ^^

she seemed nice anyway trying not to give up.. 4years into my taru.. I honestly would play again.. 9 out of 10 even if i did get my account back they prob wouldn&apos;t move me back to Remora in this time I could just level my low jobs to 75 n cook up some gil... NOTE: I was hacked on Dec 8th!!! lol and played hardcore hrs but ehh what can i say other than I already started looking at Aion sites lol... but ill keep trying and lol keep getting shut down Catrina 12-26-2007, 04:05 PM The problem with the canceling the game to show anger is the fact that a lot of people are too hooked up in the game to be able to go through that (myself included, I&apos;m afraid), but what I do know is this: no way in hell will I allow myself to get sucked into another SE MMO if that&apos;s what we can expect from them.

Probably not. I meant more about the people that weren&apos;t hacked. I can only guess at the frame of mind of struggling so much to get your account back in such an appalling condition. And sense of security shattered most of all, the&quot;happened once, can happen again&quot;feeling. Had I been hacked, I would be able to rebuild at at steady rate, not sure I&apos;d want to.

You said it all!!! exactly how I am currently feeling in regards to the trust!! Metalmyth 12-26-2007, 04:45 PM Hi All

I realize everyone has to make their own decsion on this particular issue but just so you know,

I called POL 1-858-790-7529 support and talked to the Account Team who takes care of billing, it was a rather painless process and informed him of my current situation and although he could not comment on a lot of what is going on I was able to get confirmation that:

1.) Yes SE is aware

2.) No their are no changes in policy currently or in the works

3.) Without the current CC info on file you are SOL and the only thing being looked at is a review of the customer satisfaction survey.

As for myself I have cancelled my account (only requirement is the current CC info on file) that is linked to my POL ID (two charcters) what this means is I have the next 30 days to log in and do whatever I want to, but I will not be billed from this moment on, After 30 days my account will be cancelled and is put into a kind of holding state for 90 days, during this time I can log in at any time and reactivate with no reactivation fees. I did recieve a cancellation reference # in case I might need it.

Further in most situations the characters will be held on the system for a period of 12 months at which time they can be reactivated (again no reactivation fee) but the only gurantee is 90 days. As I said, everyone must make their own decsion ,I just felt I would post what I found out for others who may be considering the same...the whole process took about 6 minutes.

Well they aint gonna have many customers for long if they keep goin the way theyre goin atm they really NEED to Make certain details + reg codes the key to the account and not the CC + bill address as they aint gonna have many ppl left to play if they all get hacked or raped so bad they dont have the will to rebuild their character. Cesaria 12-26-2007, 05:19 PM As a possible source of getting some adverse publicity that might begin to get the message through to SE - I was thinking if we started to contact the BBC News Online site they might be inclined to pick the story up (especially this time of year when there isn&apos;t that much happening really). I remember them running an article in the tech section before when the DDOS attacks were going on etc, and they&apos;ve covered the game before - usually in a&quot;what alternatives are there to WoW&quot;angle, so they do appear to know the game exists - unlike a lot of media sources. Not at my home PC at the moment so kinda limited what I can do but it&apos;s a possible avenue. ronin sparthos 12-26-2007, 06:15 PM Hi All

I called and asked if they were aware of the issue, some of the reps said yes - some said no. Its like no one knows what the fuck is going on at SE... Zeth 12-26-2007, 06:33 PM i just talked to another POL rep today. was the most helpful one yet.. he had told me that they are looking into this problem.. i asked about putting a freeze on my account. he told he could not do so. but the best way to&quot;maybe&quot;get it on freeze is to FAX 310-356-3833 Attn: Mr. Bisby with

1) police report -&quot;must have&quot;

2) POL ID and info&quot;reg codes etc&quot;

3) Personal info&quot;real name&quot;address/email

4) what dates/times hacked / gear that was stolen / character name / server

I love how no matter who you talk to, they always seem to direct you over to somebody else, only to end up right where you started.

Thanks SE. I should be able to pick up a police report within the next few days so I&apos;ll report if having one matters or not. Tlieaxu 12-26-2007, 11:27 PM I spoke to another useless person today who actually hung up on me because I was asking questions and he would tell me he couldn&apos;t even answer any questions until I verified myself on the account, his name was david mr.&quot;I don&apos;t have a rep ID&quot;when I told him it was on his badge he then said again&quot;I don&apos;t have a rep ID&quot;he was completely useless stated they could not freeze acounts it was someone else who does so, I asked who he said he didn&apos;t know, he told me people would phone me if things change I told him I didn&apos;t believe that because I have still not gotten a call back from thier manager which has been 2 weeks since I asked. I also asked if has ever met his manager he replied&quot;... yes.. I have before&quot;I asked what his manager does if he doesn&apos;t manage the staff... he didn&apos;t seem to know.

also last person we talked to said we needed a police report in order for them to even look at the accounts, basically stated nobody even cares to look at them unless there is one.

I will be getting a report when the officer gets back from vacation... saskiot 12-27-2007, 01:53 AM DAMN SE really need to get its ass in gear and fix this before someone goes&quot;Postal&quot;in there offices. I was talking to a friend of mine he never played the game. He said he wanted to drive down there with a crap load of bricks and tie papers with stolen account names and throw them at all the windows (hes crazy enough to do it too).
really its sad we are what makes SE they gives us a story and game to play and enjoy now 2500 people are turning there backs on them and many more to come.
i was lucky not only do i use firefox but also im on vista with no real player i found the bug on my system and got rid of it then went on my ps2 and changed my password.

for all of u that got hacked my heart goes out to you. I hope and pray you all get your accounts back.
I say everyone that lives close to the SE office we go out and protest make SE look bad really bad. thinktank 12-27-2007, 01:59 AM Instead of throwing bricks. I would suggest the idea of mailing a brick to their US office with the character name and date of being taken. 2500+ bricks mailed to their office would cause them to figure out how to dispose of the bricks and take the issue seriously.

People are doing this for their congress member in the United States for the border issue.

If I got hacked I would absolutely picket their El Segundo office like how the writers guild is picketing television producers. SwampdonkeyPLD 12-27-2007, 05:17 AM Thought I would post my experience.

I called my local computer fraud detective and told him my account was worth about 7.5k on ebay to hopefully make the crime more serious in his eyes I guess. He talked to SE and as long as I was willing to sign a sworn afidavit saying I never broke SE&apos;s terms of service, he would get a court order to get my account back and SE would investigate as well. I was all hell yea I&apos;ll get my account back, however when I first talked to the cop I screwed myself. He asked if anyone had the password to my account, and I said not when it was stolen. Giving out your password is a breach of the ToS and therefore he said he would arrest me if I signed the afidavit. So I suppose as long as you don&apos;t screw yourself like me there is hope to getting your account back. I had called the POL center and they said they would abide by a court order and not fight it, but I only talked to one person, so who really knows if they would or wouldn&apos;t. The cop did say he would continue to investigate though.

Also, can anyone imagine calling up the police and reporting a stolen car only to have the policemen say if you can&apos;t tell me where it is I can&apos;t help you. Thats what SE&apos;s policy seems to be with accounts, only with CC information. achren 12-27-2007, 06:45 AM Just a heads up, if you cancel your content ID to get a point across, it&apos;s going to cost you $27.90 to reactivate it (I don&apos;t remember why, I just remember that it does).

yeah, they charge you double, i got fucked over so bad one month cause i didn&apos;t know that, haha. my boyfriend and i each have separate accounts, so two accounts doubled one month when we came back from&quot;quitting&quot;really sucked.

the reason for it is because they won&apos;t charge you until the beginning of the next month, so basically if you reactivate your account 2 days before the beginning of the month when they charge you, they will charge you for that month that just started and the previous month as well. :? bombard 12-27-2007, 08:17 AM Just a heads up, if you cancel your content ID to get a point across, it&apos;s going to cost you $27.90 to reactivate it (I don&apos;t remember why, I just remember that it does).

I guess Prorating isn&apos;t in SE&apos;s business model.

Seriously though, I&apos;d like to know if the JP community has the same hacking problems we do, and how they are handled compared to us. It just seems really odd that a business would treat people as badly as they do us with the mindset that people will keep paying. Wow ... i mean come on. They aren&apos;t the only MMO in town. You&apos;re disgracing the Final Fantasy name and shoving it up all your loyal fans of 20+ years SE (yes, worse than that bakaball or whatever it was in FFX). I really hope they are at least treating their JP customers better than the rest of us. I can understand being biased more than working on such a failed business model. If you don&apos;t fix it, it will catch up to you. Poor customer service will ALWAYS catch up to you. setzor 12-27-2007, 08:47 AM Just got off the phone with the computer crimes/fraud division of the Dallas Police Department.

After going back and forth with the guy for 30 minutes, he agreed to try and ask the DA what the options were and if a subpoena was possible.
According to the guy I spoke with, he said the DA would probably laugh at this because it&apos;s over a video game.

He said he&apos;d call me back, I doubt he will.

Good Morning All

I am not sure if SE has changed this recently but I spoke to a Daniel in billing and I specifically asked about reactivation and was told there is no reactivation fee and that I would be charged for the month I reactivated in as an example:

If SE got their heads out of their butts on let&apos;s say Jan.15 and I reactivated at that time, then I would be billed for the month of January, because their billing is issued at the begining of the month. Feb.1 I would be billed 13.95 for Jan.15 to Jan.30 and I would also be billed 13.95 for Feb.1-Feb.30 so I understand how this could be interpreted as a reactivation fee, but really it&apos;s not they bill for a 30 day period regardless.

The point is SE is unwilling to listen and respond to our complaints, respond to online petitions, their support staff depending on who you get will give a different answer each time.....in a nutshell their is no accountability. As I said before each of you have to make your own decsion on the matter, but if SE is unwilling to respond in a offical capacity on the issue, change policy and introduce mechanisms that other MMORPG&apos;s have in place for situations such as this you will be left with the following:

1.) If you do happen to get your account back it will be stripped of all valuable gear possibly you will still have your Rare/EX gear if it wasn&apos;t dropped

2.) You will be faced with borrowing gil from friends or LS to get some of your gear back to enable you to farm to make the rest of the gil you will need

3.) If you do not get your account returned you will be faced with leveling a new character and I don&apos;t have to tell you the time involved to do that and don&apos;t forget the reg codes you will need as your previous reg codes are now invalid, so you will have to go and buy all the software and expansion packs all over again to get the new reg codes you will need but hey you can buy Vana&apos;diel Collection 2007 Windows and the WOTG expansion.....pretty good deal for SE not to give back your account huh?

Oh and by the way the first two options come with the caveat that SE continues to charge you the 13.95 a month fee so there is no incentive on their end to react quickly

Also the above comes with one big gotcha.... if it happens again you are SOL, if you want you can go out and run every possible A/V progam and keep it updated on the hour (as SE does not officially recgonize one in particular) but be warned you are on your own, Run Firefox, do not go to any websites other than Playonline.com or those run specfically by SE as their is no offical list from SE as to what is good and what is bad so....any website is a potentially affected site And if we look at&quot;Ronin&apos;s&quot;recent experience that occured on Dec.23 he was hit with a brand new keylogger Ronin was aware of everything going on in this thread and knew exactly what to look for and what to avoid but got hit anyway.

One final point SE and the STF have made it quite clear that their Anti-RMT efforts have been showing dramatic results, consider this, it would take weeks of fish botting and NM botting on their end with multiple accounts to make millions of gil, On just my account in a 6 hour period the RMT&apos;s made 13 million gil and used only two accounts...mine and the mule he traded all my stuff to sell and thats just me, so if you think that the RMT are not going to continue with this attack or it will slow down anytime soon....why would they?

SE&apos;s total lack of response or actions to protect it&apos;s players against this type of abuse has basically given the RMT&apos;s a licence to hack and for millions of gil, minimal effort and no consequences or at least no apparent consequences. It is true that it will take time for SE to properly respond (if there is even a plan to) but do you really want to continue paying for an insecure service that offers absolutley zero protection to the paying customer?

For myself I have not quit just simply put my account into a status that I will no longer be billed and will wait for SE to properly respond and then I will reactivate but that&apos;s my own personal choice Rutsahl 12-27-2007, 10:28 AM edit Lyramion 12-27-2007, 11:36 AM Random sidenote:


I asked a JP friend about if there aere any reports on hijacked accounts on JP BBS. His imediate response only was&quot;Many, too many.. ; ;&quot;. Seems like the JP are getting hit just as hard :x Ddong 12-27-2007, 12:19 PM Should quit now before you are next =)
For 28 Bucks per 1 million, its not a bad offer to pass up.

You do the math. Icy 12-27-2007, 01:30 PM About them asking for police reports.... I sent in mine and they said it was not sufficient enough for them Lawl. They also did not bother to reply to me after I faxed it in with a note asking for a reply and giving them all my contact info (email, address, home phone etc). I had to call them and wait 40 mins for a supervisor to talk to the person I had on the phone. ronin sparthos 12-27-2007, 01:41 PM So basically nothing short of being the RMT and saying they jacked the account will do anything.

I -knew- the police report was just shit they were using to stonewall....

Good luck setz. I went to my local police department and they said they couldn&apos;t/wouldn&apos;t do anything when I told them my situation. They said they could only do something if you can show them that the haxors used your credit card past when the account was lost to you. So if they charge next months fees on your card, then they MIGHT do something. He then said more then likely you can just dispute it with the credit card company and they can take care of it. The funny thing is I already canceled my credit card which was on file with SE when my account was stolen to protect me from this :roll:

I at least hope the haxors use an invalid CC on my account so it will be frozen when SE tries to charge next months fees. Maybe then they might do something since they will be losing $$$..... setzor 12-27-2007, 01:48 PM So, since when asked by myself and my wife if people were really getting their accounts back with subpoenas, the guy told me that lots of people were getting their accounts with subpoena&apos;s.

By the way, and I hope SE is reading: GM Cayenne is a fking idiot.

SleepySamurai&gt;I called in regards to the recent hackings that have been going on lately. Has SE begun to lock accounts of those

SleepySamurai&gt;that reported them as stolen?

GM Cayenne&gt;I am very sorry that this has happened and apologize for the inconvenience. I would suggest that you contact the Information center on PlayOnline.com, Service and Support, CHAT

GM Cayenne&gt;They will fully assist you with the matter.

SleepySamurai&gt;Okay... I see. SE is not doing anything about the hacked accounts at the moment?

GM Cayenne&gt;If your account was compromised, then please do follow the instructions and call them.

SleepySamurai&gt;I called. Credit Card was changed.

GM Cayenne&gt;Then IO am afraid that there is nothing that can be done. If the Information center cannot assist you with teh issue, there is nothing I can do.

This is all I was able to copy from the POL chat, but that&apos;s the last thing he said before hanging up on me.

A friend was told by a GM that they are supposedly locking down hacked accounts. And that firewalls are being placed on their servers? (Uh... they didn&apos;t have firewalls to begin with?) Gere 12-27-2007, 03:29 PM By the way, and I hope SE is reading: GM Cayenne is a fking idiot.

Sounds more like he&apos;s sick of being asked the same question 500million times that he doesn&apos;t know the answer to and can&apos;t do anything about, he seemed to have filed you under&quot;person who will yell at me about hacked accounts that I have no authority over unless I hang up with them as quickly as possible&quot;. ronin sparthos 12-27-2007, 03:44 PM Much like the 2400+ people are tired of being told to call the cops, then in turn are told the resulting police report faxed to SE isnt enough which then in turns makes the police unwilling to help you at all because they have more important things to do than tell some japanese corporation that someone isnt bullshitting about something happening. Maybe that GM will stop munching on his spongecake and tell his manager:

&apos;hey im tired of answering the same questions, can someone have someone throw up an announcement on POL to STOP calling us and to do &apos;x&apos; to get &apos;y&apos; back&apos;

If i was in his position id be bitching to managers, who can then in turn bitch up the chain of command. That Bisby guy should have some fun reading those support surveys soon as well.

....and they said GMs cant do anything~ Jeny 12-27-2007, 03:54 PM By the way, and I hope SE is reading: GM Cayenne is a fking idiot.

Then maybe forward me to someone who does? What&apos;s the point of filling out a Subject and Body note when contacting a GM on POL? Also, I&apos;ve never yelled at a GM/Rep...

And if he&apos;s so sick of being asked the same question 500 Million times. Then maybe he should quit and go work for a Fast Food Restaurant or something, where he may ask the same question 500 million times instead.&quot;Hi, what would you like to order?&quot; setzor 12-27-2007, 03:57 PM and i&apos;ll be one of those sams wearing a domaru camping a Serket near you.

Gathering from the recent events and things i&apos;m hearing, if it is true they are setting up a&quot;firewall&quot;to block the RMT&apos;s from accessing the system altogether, things kinda come into picture.

Picture this idea for a second (keep in mind, i still think SE policy is bullshit):

------------

SE gets hit with a few account thefts, no big deal, they probably get these all the time...

Then! The big swarm of account thefts come in, oh shit, SE realises they&apos;ve got a serious issue.

SE, once discovering it&apos;s RMT&apos;s hacking their players, realises that this is a perfect opportunity to put a giant nail in the RMT coffin.

SE starts having a buncha meetings and discussions about this issue and how they can fix it(that shit takes time, believe me, especially for them they have to nail it from all aspects), meanwhile still trying to manage the other things going on(expansion stuff, their other MMO, etc). While it is a big problem, they can&apos;t really devote 100% of their time to trying to solve it, the world really can&apos;t stop for maybe 1% of their game population getting raped.

SE comes to the conclusion that they have to work secretly so that the RMT&apos;s wont realise that there&apos;s any plans in the works to rape them, thus no updates on SE website. Reasons for this is so that the RMT&apos;s will think they are winning and can go about their bullshit with no shortened timescale(so that they wont go on a major account raping spree, cuz i guarentee you, they&apos;ve probably got at least 10,000 or so accounts of info, most of which haven&apos;t been even attempted yet), and SE can get even more information on the attackers. This would be understandable from looking into every account that has been reported stolen and checking/comparing IP&apos;s of the people logging into reported accounts.

---- and now here we are ----

SE is probably waiting til first of the month to see how many of these accounts credit cards fail so that they can have even more justification for locking them out. You use a couple thousand bad credit card numbers, yer bound to be attempting something fishy, yah?

No doubt that SE already has firewalls, but they are planning on entering some large blocks of Chinese IP numbers into the&quot;do not allow&quot;list preventing them from logging in.

SE will then make a statement apologizing for the rediculous delay of information and explain everything that went on during the month long account stealing process, and that they are revising their policy, or making a policy exception to allow legit players who&apos;s accounts were stolen to be recovered.

If you think of our stolen accounts as being used for the ultimate justice against RMT&apos;s it doesn&apos;t really feel so bad. It still sucks ass and it&apos;s bullshit, but hey...

I think we&apos;ll have our update by end of next week, and it&apos;s gonna be mostly good news. Only bad I can see is that they won&apos;t be offering full restorations because of game balance issues, blah blah blah...

Anyhow, that&apos;s my 2 cents, what do you guys think... I know alot of you guys are just on the&quot;burn SE to the ground train&quot;like i Mostly am, but seeing these guys at fanfest, I think they really love this game and the players, so I can&apos;t really see them as just snubbing so many hardworking players over shit that for the most part, couldn&apos;t be helped...How safe is&quot;Safe&quot;anyway...

--Setzor Shiriokumo 12-27-2007, 04:46 PM this is SE we are talkin about there is no way anyone involved with ffxi on their part has the iq to come up with something like that lol . Shojin 12-27-2007, 05:19 PM Personally, I&apos;m hoping they implement a way to retrieve characters through the registration codes. Then laugh as every bought account in FFXI shit themselves. :bagel: Popsiclestick 12-27-2007, 05:40 PM Just got off the phone.

Deactivated my 2 accounts (1 primary acct, 3 mules and 2 75&apos;s on the other account with 1 mule) until policies change.

Oh and FYI, the double charge is a delayed charge until the beginning of the next billing cycle. They charge the month you activated + the current month. So if you activated today, Dec. 27, then you would get billed at the beginning for next month for Dec and Jan. Infini 12-27-2007, 06:04 PM Ultimately the only hope we have is if these guys are blocked off from the system alltogether through IP blocks or DNS blockings.
Its a pity tho SE could easily fix alot of the issues if they added a seperate password to the membership section that doesnt use the same password as the PoL/password combo and they added a compromised account procedure that used the ORIGINAL REG CODES FROM ALL CURRENT INSTALLED EXPANSIONS as proof and the unchangable details like name email etc.

Also on another note all payments at the beginning of the month are for THAT current month if your one of those that got hacked have ya tried charging back SE for that month on the grounds that the account was taken from under your control even tho you had the original codes your address and cc was on the account up to the day you were hacked etc?

I called the Credit Card company and canceled my credit card and disputed the monthly charge since my account was stolen. They said they would contact SE, but more then likely they will just eat the monthly charge themselves instead of going after SE for it. ronin sparthos 12-27-2007, 06:26 PM Its a pity tho SE could easily fix alot of the issues if they added a seperate password to the membership section that doesnt use the same password as the PoL/password combo and they added a compromised account procedure that used the ORIGINAL REG CODES FROM ALL CURRENT INSTALLED EXPANSIONS as proof and the unchangable details like name email etc

This is the only way anything will get stopped, blocking IP addresses can be gotten around. Zeth 12-27-2007, 06:41 PM Setzor post does make alot of sense.. there is ALOT of things going on atm and it cant be fixed in a few weeks..... me like MANY others are getting impatient, but what CAN we really do? now that i really think about it :-k nothing... :mad: apperently its very difficult to get a Subpoena mainly cause to ALOT more people its just a game&quot;get over it&quot;.. but like me and many others 4yrs of your life just cant be dropped like this.. im sure now that this toll is so high and people have even stopped playing due to this it will send SE a message. time time time is what it takes.... only thing i can hope for now is FULL item recovery one month - 2 months from now, or until Warhammer comes out...


but for now Counter Strike never gets old Catrina 12-27-2007, 07:15 PM This is the part that astonishes me. People are justifiably getting impatient, since they don&apos;t even see the problem officially addressed, instead all we see is that pre-made text/disclaimer they&apos;ve been feeding us for at least 2 years. I think that at this point it&apos;s what people would like to see addressed at the very least.

Yet...SE is working on a new MMO, so obviously as far as the bottom line, FFXI must have been positive for them at least so far. Is alienating potential customers with horrible customer support a sound move to make? I know Japanese players are usually very loyal towards a product, but NA and EU aren&apos;t nearly as much, and if they get seriously pissed off, they tend to boycott it. Especially with all the (way more popular) alternatives out there, and new MMO&apos;s coming out constantly, and many of them from people with proven MMO market know-how.

Or is SE&apos;s plan to only release stuff in Japan from now on and simply close NA and EU offices? Because if they&apos;re not going to, they certainly have me fooled. And as the saying goes..&quot;fool me once, shame on you,fool me twice, shame on me&quot;. If I even consider picking up another SE online game, guess what I&apos;m gonna read before I spend a dime? That&apos;s right, the ToS (And I&apos;m pretty sure what I&apos;ll find there, which is sad).


But I have to agree, the posts make a lot of sense,especially considering how formal Japanese business models usually are about everything. ronin sparthos 12-27-2007, 07:20 PM Problem is, the longer SE takes to address the issue is the higher the volume of people affected becomes meaning the bigger chance that SE pulls out the:

&apos;we cant help you with your items because it&apos;ll affect game balance&apos; card.

Getting our accounts back is fine and all, but getting the actual &apos;work&apos; back (items) will be my deciding point to if i continue playing or just quit altogether because doing over everything for the sake of fixing what the RMT ravaged isnt worth doing especially when SE is handling the situation so poorly to begin with.

Its no wonder RMT see this as the most logical way to make the paycheck at the end of the day because its a full win situation to them. Free labor, eradication of the legit players in exchange for players more &apos;willing&apos; to buy &apos;services&apos; and little to no resistance from anyone period. Sykes 12-27-2007, 07:24 PM I called the Credit Card company and canceled my credit card and disputed the monthly charge since my account was stolen. They said they would contact SE, but more then likely they will just eat the monthly charge themselves instead of going after SE for it.The merchant is always responsible for the charge-back. Square-Enix will pay for the reversed charge and will pay an additional charge-back fee on top of the refund amount. Metalmyth 12-27-2007, 08:35 PM Just got off the phone.

Good for you Popsiclestick

I feel the only way to send SE a message at this point is exactly that, by financially sending them a message, it may seem that it won&apos;t get noticed but I am sure alot of the accounts that are currently under hacker control is with invalid CC info. Combine that with enough people putting their account in a holding state and someone will start to notice.

An intresting note from the STF report from Dec.19:

Quote:

- Gil and item exchange for real world money.
November 15, Approx. 20 cases
November 28, Approx. 10 cases
December 3, Approx. 110 cases
December 13, Approx. 70 cases
December 19, Approx. 530 cases

It doesn&apos;t take a genius to realize that players that were hacked are being forced to resort to buying gil in order to restore the stolen equipment. I am by no means condoning this behaviour but if the STF used half the efforts they put forth as claimed here in the same report:

Quote:

- Are people involved in purchasing RMT gil and items able to avoid punishment by using multiple accounts and feigning ignorance of the source of the gil/items?
All in-game activity is recorded in temporary logs (*4). The Special Task Force uses these logs to track the movement of illegal gil and items, which allows us to discern not only the accounts involved in the initial transaction, but also the accounts that are the ultimate recipients of RMT services.
As well as the use of multiple accounts, we have seen various other methods with which people attempt to evade culpability; however, there is no escape from the data trail left in our logs.

Maybe the STF could use their cracker jack log reading abilities to get back the stolen accounts and help in restoring the items taken off the legit players. SE what do you think will happen if and when you restore an account that has 3 + years of playing and all the equipment/gil has been taken? Of course those players will consider buying gil. As for game balance if you were to restore at least the items (forget the gil)....get a grip it&apos;s data nothing more, if your that worried about it make the restored items Rare/Ex.

Just so my postion is clear I don&apos;t endorse buying gil all I am saying is if you read the report above there is a reason in the sudden rise and when SE makes no statement, GM&apos;s and POL support say there is nothing they can or will do. Legit and honest players will suddenly feel they have no other alternative.
