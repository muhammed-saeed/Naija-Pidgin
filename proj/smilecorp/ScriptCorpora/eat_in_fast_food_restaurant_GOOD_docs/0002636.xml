 Blue bins also on their way to more businesses, apartments 

BY JILL COWAN Californian staff writer jcowan@bakersfield.com
 
While the city of Bakersfield recently made a big splash by announcing plans to offer citywide curbside residential recycling, an even bigger effort is under way to boost commercial recycling, including at apartment complexes.

As Solid Waste Director Kevin Barnes put it, &quot;Everybody&apos;s going to be real aware of commercial recycling real soon.&quot;

Tons of recyclable dry goods are unloaded by City of Bakersfield worker, Luis Aldaco, Friday, at the BARC MRF, material recovery facility. This is where BARC clients sort, bail and eventually sell the recycled goods.
 
While it&apos;s been shocking to many that Bakersfield is the state&apos;s largest jurisdiction without full curbside recycling, the vast majority of the city&apos;s recyclables and green waste comes from businesses, manufacturers and apartment complexes.

Barnes said Bakersfield diverts about 61 percent of its waste from landfills, and the addition of residential curbside recycling is only expected to bump that up by about 4 percent. It&apos;s unclear how the new commercial programs will affect the rate but they should make a big impact.

They&apos;ll have to.

A new law sets a state policy goal of diverting at least 75 percent of California&apos;s solid waste away from landfills by 2020, which is an increase from the currently mandated 50 percent.

A more legally binding component makes recycling mandatory for businesses that generate more than 4 cubic yards of trash per week, and for multi-family residences with five or more units.

Barnes said most service businesses like restaurants and stores fill up a typical 3 cubic yard dumpster twice a week. He estimated that about 3,300, or 55 percent, of Bakersfield&apos;s businesses will be subject to the new regulations, including the ones already recycling voluntarily.

How cities and counties ensure compliance will be &quot;between the hauler and the jurisdiction,&quot; said Mark Oldfield, spokesman for CalRecycle. And the law doesn&apos;t mandate a specific percentage or amount that businesses must recycle.

Statewide, about two-thirds of all waste comes from the commercial sector, Oldfield said.

&quot;We realize going in it&apos;s not a one-size-fits-all thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s up to the jurisdiction what would be an appropriate model for them locally.&quot;

Municipalities must start phasing in their programs by July 1.

Barnes said he hopes to detail costs and potential implementation plans in a report to the City Council in February or March.

Barnes said the city has had voluntary recycling programs for businesses for about two decades, including cardboard pick-up for mid-sized businesses like fast food restaurants, and on-site recycling compactors that fill up an entire truck load for larger retailers and warehouses.

Now, and under the new law, businesses can also haul their own refuse to recycling centers.

At the moment, he said, &quot;we have about 130 (businesses) on commercial blue bins, we probably have about 50 on blue carts and about 75 really big places that have big compactors.&quot;

Large businesses such as Target and Walmart make most of the city&apos;s trash and, consequently, most of the city&apos;s recycling. So when the city started its major recycling push a couple of years ago to increase the overall diversion rate, Barnes said Bakersfield emphasized commercial recycling.

&quot;Warehouses would be throwing away stacks of pallets and cardboard,&quot; he said. &quot;We set up recycling for all that big, bulky (stuff) soonest.&quot;

In many cases, Barnes said, convincing businesses to start recycling was easy because it can save money.

&quot;If you&apos;re a mid-sized business, like a fast food restaurant or a mini-mart, you might have three times a week trash pick-up,&quot; Barnes explained. &quot;You learn of our cardboard program that we already have and you say, &apos;Gee, I could fit a second bin for cardboard only and then I can cut my trash bin down to maybe twice a week.&quot;

That, he said, cuts back on the landfill fee to bury the garbage. He said three-day- per-week commercial trash pick-up costs $335.24 for mid-sized businesses while twice-per-week pick-up with cardboard service runs $300.36.

Barnes said a major task ahead is working with individual businesses to figure out recycling plans that will work best with what they already do.

Some businesses, like local McDonald&apos;s restaurants, contract with private recyclers and that can continue.

BARC, a nonprofit that runs a large recycling sorting facility, does pick-up for McDonald&apos;s in the area, said the restaurants&apos; spokesman, Jim Darling.

&quot;There is value to the cardboard for BARC,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s a money-maker for McDonald&apos;s.&quot;

Still, said Carole Bahmani, owner of three Bakersfield McDonald&apos;s locations, the golden arches encourage recycling for its own sake.

&quot;There have been some extensive recycling programs we&apos;ve tried in this region,&quot; she said, including in-store recycling for customers. &quot;(There were) simply not enough resources (in local government) to handle it on the other end.&quot;

But, she said, she thinks that will change.

And though Barnes said in some cases the savings from recycling services don&apos;t outweigh the employee time required to sort through garbage, Bahmani said it&apos;s not a problem.

&quot;It&apos;s fairly simple,&quot; she said. &quot;When the (supply) delivery comes in, we make sure the cardboard recycling gets stacked up. It&apos;s a matter of top-of-mind awareness, but not a lot of work.&quot;

Nevertheless, Barnes said, there are still plenty of businesses that throw everything in the trash. And they&apos;re the ones who will need to change under AB 341.

For apartment complexes, no set recycling collection program exists, so apartment dwellers have to drive their own recycling to drop-off centers.

&quot;I&apos;m at three different communities, and you get a lot of questions about why the city doesn&apos;t have (apartment recycling),&quot; said Connie Gardner, community director at Redwood Glen Apartment Homes in Laurelglen, &quot;especially if people located from different areas.&quot;

Aurora Rush, Barnes&apos; counterpart for unincorporated county areas, said that for cities like Bakersfield that have relatively robust commercial recycling programs already, complying with the law will mostly mean creating the most efficient programs to accept the increased demand.

In the county, she said, just identifying all the businesses who qualify will be extra work.

&quot;We just have to be able to do a lot of education,&quot; she said. &quot;Many businesses are already doing recycling with our haulers.&quot;

Waste haulers who contract with the city and county say they&apos;re waiting on official cues before making any definite plans with regards to new routes or equipment.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of different avenues the city and the county could take. We&apos;re just waiting for their direction,&quot; said Ray Scott, an administrator at Price Environmental Services, which services parts of Bakersfield and the county. &quot;There is a cost to recycling, it&apos;s just a matter of how efficient someone is.&quot;

Gardner, who was unaware of the new recycling law, wondered about certain logistical factors -- like how the city would deal with recycling scavengers she sees digging through dumpsters each day.

But ultimately, she said, &quot;I think it&apos;s a great idea to have some type of program implemented because we have so much waste.&quot;
