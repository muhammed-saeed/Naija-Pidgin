 Download   Types of Restaurant services Restaurants fall into several industry classification based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing. Addition ally, how the food is served to the customer helps to determine the classification. Historically, restaurant referred only to places that provided tables where one sat down to eat the meal, typically served by a waiter. Following the rise of fast food and take-out restaurants, a retronym for the older &quot;standard&quot; restauran t was created, sit-down restaurant. Most commonly, &quot;sit-down restauran t&quot; refers to a casual dining restaurant with table service rather than a fast-food restaurant where one orders f ood at a counter. Sit-down restaurants are often further categorized as &quot;family-style&quot; or &quot;formal&quot;. In British English, the term restaurant almost always means an eating e stablishment with table service, so the &quot;sit-down&quot; qualification is not usually necessary. Fast food and takeaway (takeout) outlets with counter service are not normally referred to as restaurants. Outside of North-Am erica the t erms Fast casual-dining restaurants, Family style, and Casual dining are not used. Junk food establishments would also not often be referred to as a &apos; restaurant&apos;. F ast-food restaurants Fast-food restaurants emphasize speed of service and low cost over other considerations. A common feature of newer fast-food restaurants that distinguishes them from traditional cafeteria is a lack of cutlery or c rockery; the customer is expected to eat the food directly from the disposable container it was served in. One popular variation in North America is the de li or delicatessen, offering made-to-order sandwiches and/or salads from behind a counter. Fast- food operations range from small-scale street vendors with carts to franchised mega- corporations like McDonald&apos;s. Although traditionally serving unhealthy food made with pre- prepared ingredients, there are now many fast food restaurants such as Subway and Au Bon Pain that offer fresh and nutritional food. Fast casual restaurants do not offer table service, but may offer non-disposable plates and cutlery. The quality of food, and price point, are h igher than those of a conventional fast-food restaurant. Family style Family style restaurants are restaurants that have a fixed menu and fixed price, usually with diners seated at a communal table such as on bench seats. True to their name, these restaurants tend to be single-family businesses.   C asual dining A casual dining restaurant is a restaurant that serves moderately-priced food in a casual atmosphere. Except for buffet-style restaurants, casual dining restaurants typically provide table service. Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast food establishments and fine dining restaurants. Casual dining restauran ts usually have a full bar with separate bar staff, a larger beer menu and a limited wine menu. They are fre quently, but not necessarily, part of a wider chain, particularly in the United States. Entrepreneur Norman Brinker was the &quot;father&quot; of casual dining. Fine dining Fine dining restaurants are full service restaurants with specific dedicated meal courses. Décor of such restaurants feature higher quality materials with an eye towards the &quot;atmosphere&quot; desired by the restaurateur. The wait staff is usually highly t rained and often wears more formal attire. Fine-dining restaurants are almost always small businesses and are generally either single-location operations or have just a few locations. Food portions are smaller but more visually appealing as well. Others Most of these es tablishments can be considered subtypes of fast casual-dining restauran ts or casual-dinin g restaurants. C afé Cafés and coffee shops are informal restaurants offering a range of hot meals and made-to- order sandwiches. Many cafés are open for breakfast and serve full hot breakfasts. In some areas cafés offer outdoor seating. The major difference with a café and most other casual dining establishments is how the guest orders and pays. A café can offer table s ervice, but many times the guest orders at the front, and the food is brought out to the table. Then, while at most casual dining restaurants the guest pays with the server, at a café the guest most often times pays with a single cashier.   C afeterias A cafeteria is a restaurant serving mostly ready-cooked food arranged behind a f ood-serving counter. There is little or no table se rvice. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter. Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions alr eady on plates, or self-serve their own portions. In the UK, a cafeteria may a lso offer a large selection of hot food similar to the American fast casual restauran t, and the use of the term cafeteria is deprecated in favour of s elf-service restaurant. C offeehouse Coffeehouses are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize coffee and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwich es are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings. Pub Main article: pub Mainly in the UK and other countries influenced by British culture, a pub (short for public house) is a bar that serves simple food fa re. Traditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a decidedly secondary position, whereas the modern pub business relies on food as well, to the point where gastropubs are often essentially fine-dining establishments, known for their high-quality pub food a nd concomitantly high prices. A ty pical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap. Bistros and brasserie In France, a brasserie is a café doubling as a restaurant and serving single dishes and other meals in a relaxed setting. A bistro is a familiar name for a café serving moderately priced simple meals in an unpretentious setting, especially in Paris; bistros have become increasingly popular with tourists. When used in English, the term bi stro usually indicates either a fast casual-dinin g restaurant with a European-influenced menu or a cafés with a larger menu of food. of 00
