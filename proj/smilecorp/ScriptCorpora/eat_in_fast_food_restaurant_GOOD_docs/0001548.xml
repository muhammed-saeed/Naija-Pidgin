 ...Today is World Environment Day ( Every 5th of June is a day used by the United Nations to
stimulate worldwide awareness of environmental issues and encourages
political action.) 
 ...Today is
Gingerbread Day*
...This is International Volunteers Week

 *Gingerbread Exercise...
 Remember the story of the little gingerbread man who
hopped out of the oven and sang, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can...you
can&apos;t catch me, I&apos;m the gingerbread man.&quot; He was chased by a whole
collection of people, but was finally outsmarted by a fox and ended up
as a tasty morsel in the fox&apos;s mouth. Well, you don&apos;t need to be a foxy
snack, but you could pretend you were the gingerbread man and &quot;run, run
as fast as you can.&quot; Or even trot, trot as fast as you can ...or stroll, stroll as fast as you can . Scientific studies are now
showing that only ten minutes of exercise several times a day can keep
you in shape. So run or trot or stroll your way to better health and
lower weight. Instead of eating the gingerbread...run as fast as you
can!

 Got one response to my &quot;Lyle-hates-it-when-I&apos;m-right&quot; question in
yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram. It was from Georgette and she was correct. A

automobiles.

 A woman
asks her husband to figure out why the washer is making a funny noise.
He replies, &quot;Who do I look like...the Maytag Repair Man? Get someone in
to look at it!&quot;
A few days later, she asks her husband to take a look at the car and
see if he can figure out why it&apos;s not running right.
He glares at her and says, &quot;Who do I look like...Mr. Goodwrench? Take
it in for someone to look at it!&quot;
The next week he&apos;s away on business for a few days, and when he comes
back the washer is working great and the car is running smoothly.
&quot;I&apos;m glad you got those things fixed,&quot; he said. &quot;How much did it cost?&quot;
&quot;Our new next door neighbor heard me talking to someone about it,&quot; said
his wife, &quot;and
he offered to take a look, and he had them fixed in no time.&quot;
&quot;Great!&quot; said the husband, &quot;So...how much did he charge you?&quot;
&quot;Oh, he wouldn&apos;t take money. He said I could either bake him some
gingerbread or sleep with him.&quot;
The husband&apos;s jaw dropped. &quot;Well, of course, you baked him some
gingerbread... right? RIGHT?&quot;
&quot;Who do I look like,&quot; his wife replies. &quot;Betty Crocker?&quot;

 ...Today is Cheese Day
...Today is Old Maid&apos;s Day

 Where did I go wrong?
 I was wrong. You won&apos;t hear me say that very often.
Yesterday at a graduation party, while sitting at a table surrounded by
many Faddassers and people from church, Lyle calmly asked if anyone had
read the weekend Fadd Gram. Most of them had. He said he thought it was
interesting that I had the sentence, &quot;Lyle hates it when I&apos;m right&quot; and
then right above it, there was a statement which proved I was wrong. My
&quot;rightness&quot; (not to be confused with righteousness) has been kind of a
joke in church since I told them, &quot;Well, I was an Erickson and we are
always right.&quot; Faddasser Stanley reminded me of that statement. I&apos;ll
put the paragraph in again and see if you can figure out where I went
wrong.
 
The thunder is rumbling and the rain is pouring down. We just came
from a graduation and got home about two minutes before the deluge.
Lyle wanted to drive his &apos;62 Olds Tempest Convertible (with the top
down), but the rain has been sporadic all day and I convinced him we&apos;d
better take something with a roof on it. (He just hates it when I&apos;m
right.)

 Let me know if you
figure it out. I&apos;ll share it with everyone tomorrow.

         EAT BANANA BREAD AND
RAISE MONEY FOR NINA 
 
 Have you noticed the price of gas lately?
Well, here is a real deal for you. Why not consume banana bread instead? Valentino&apos;s
Restaurant in downtown Montevideo is selling banana bread for the same
price as gas. Wow! Fluctuating banana bread prices. The money
raised from the sale will go into Nina&apos;s jar at Valentino&apos;s. Go
have coffee and banana bread there. 
 
 Note:
It will be an enjoyable experience. Valentino&apos;s has the best baked
goods in town and the banana bread awesome. And what a good excuse to
eat banana bread...in moderation, of course.

 Smile for Old Maid&apos;s Day 
 A
story I&apos;ll tell of a burglar bold
Who started to rob a house;
He opened the window, and then crept in
As quiet as a mouse..... 
 He looked around for a
place to hide,
&apos;Til the folks were all asleep,
Then said he, &quot;With their money
I&apos;ll take a quiet sneak&quot;. 

 So under the bed the
burglar crept;
He crept up close to the wall;
He didn&apos;t know it was an old maid&apos;s room
Or he wouldn&apos;t have had the
gall. 

 He thought of the money
that he would steal,
As under the bed he
lay;
But at nine o&apos;clock he saw a sight
That made his hair turn gray. 

 At nine o&apos;clock the old
maid came in;
&quot;I am so tired&quot;, she said;
She
thought that all was well that night
So she didn&apos;t look under the bed. 

 She took out her teeth and
her big glass eye,
And the hair from off
her head;
The burglar, he had forty fits
As he watched from under the
bed. 

 From under the bed the
burglar crept,
He was a total wreck;
But the old maid wasn&apos;t asleep at all
And she grabbed him by the neck. 

 She didn&apos;t holler, or
shout or call,
She was as cool as a clam;
She only said, &quot;The Saints be praised,
At last I&apos;ve got a man&quot;. 

 From under the pillow a
gun she drew,
And to the burglar she said,
&quot;Young man, if you don&apos;t marry me,
I&apos;ll blow off the top of your head&quot;. 

 She held him firmly by the
neck,
He hadn&apos;t a chance to scoot;
He
looked at the teeth and the big glass eye,
And said &quot;Madam, for Pete&apos;s
sake, shoot!!&quot;

 Day 362-363 Weekend
Edition
 ...Today is Family Day
...Tomorrow is Love Conquers All Day
...Tomorrow is Egg Day
...Tomorrow is Repeat Day (Have
two eggs) 

 Sanforized... 
Back in the old days, fabric for our clothing was made from natural
fibers...fabrics like linen, woolens, and cotton. All of them would
shrink if they were washed in water that was too warm. Not only that,
they didn&apos;t dry wrinkle-free. They had to be dampened, rolled up and
put aside overnight, and then ironed. It was an all-day job. Then one
day, clothing that was &quot;Sanforized&quot; was introduced and it could
be
washed without fear of shrinkage. It was a revolutionary idea and when
buying clothing, you always checked for the &quot;Sanforized label.&quot;

 Today, I wonder if my body somehow got Sanforized back in those
old
days because it has a hard time shrinking into a smaller size. No
matter how hot the water, my shape stays the same...round. As Faddasser
David says, &quot;I&apos;m in shape. Round is a shape.&quot;

 The Grapevine 
 The thunder is rumbling and the rain is pouring down. We just came
from a graduation and got home about two minutes before the deluge.
Lyle wanted to drive his &apos;62 Olds Tempest Convertible (with the top
down), but the rain has been sporadic all day and I convinced him we&apos;d
better take something with a roof on it. (He just hates it when I&apos;m
right.)

Only four days and the Faddassers will celebrate their first
anniversary. We&apos;re going to try and put together a little party, but
not until later in June. There&apos;s so much going on right now.

Got this picture and message from Faddasser Dave after yesterday&apos;s
Hug-a-Cat-Day Smile.

 Well, am
I too late for hug your cat day? Tobie loves his coffee, too. (Tobie is their cat.) 
 
 
Tip for Today 
 Egg-zactly what you need in an omelet..no yolk! 
Omelets are usually made of three eggs. Why not try one whole egg and
one or two egg whites? Or better yet, use egg substitute for all three
eggs.

 Smile for Today 
 The elderly pastor was searching his closet for
his collar before
church one Sunday morning. In the back of the closet, he found a small
box containing 3 eggs and 100 $1 bills. He called his wife into the
closet to ask her about the box and its contents. 
 Embarrassed,
she admitted having hidden the box there for their entire 45 years of
marriage. Disappointed and hurt, the pastor asked her, &quot;WHY?&quot; The wife
replied that she hadn&apos;t wanted to hurt his feelings. 

 He asked
her how the box could have hurt his feelings. She said that every time
during their marriage that he had delivered a poor sermon, she had
placed an egg in the box. 

 The pastor felt that 3 poor sermons
in 45 years was certainly nothing to feel bad about, so he asked her
what the $100 was for. 
 She replied, &quot;Each time I got a dozen
eggs, I sold them to the neighbors for $1.&quot;
 
(Disclaimer: This is a joke. I don&apos;t know ANYONE that it could pertain
to. Repeat: This is a joke.)

 Day 361
 ...Today is Fri-i-i-i-i-iday!
...Today is the first day of June
...Today is Hug Your Cat Day
...Today is Side Dish Day
...Today is Pen Pal Day

 Not the main course...
 Sometimes when we have a big meal laid out in front of
us, we concentrate on the entrees and aren&apos;t careful when eating the
extras. Since this is &quot;Side Dish Day,&quot; you need to think about the
little &quot;extras&quot; that you eat with your meal. The before-you-begin
tastes. The olives and pickles. The dressings and croutons on your
salad. Each item by itself isn&apos;t so much, but you put them all together
and you can hang on quite a few calories.

With all the graduation festivities this time of year, it&apos;s good to
think about the &quot;side dishes.&quot; Fresh fruit is good. A small piece of
cake. (Moderation.) A cup of fruit punch. Take it easy on the
sandwiches with the fancy fillings and the extra desserts. Celebrate
with the grads, but be careful that you don&apos;t graduate yourself into
the next size.

 The Grapevine 
 Nina had a tough day yesterday with the bone marrow test, but she
made it back to her school picnic. She&apos;s a real trooper.

It&apos;s been raining off and on in Montevideo today, but not enough to do
more than dampen the spirits of graduation hosts and hostesses.

 A chocolate dilemma...
 My soap opera life goes on. For the bonfire last
Friday, I bought Hershey bars, marshmallows and graham crackers for
s&apos;mores. We didn&apos;t use all the makin&apos;s so I brought them home. Last
year I left the same kind of ingredients in the trunk of my car and
guess what? The Hersheys melted. Have you ever seen a melted Hershey?
They turn light tan around the edges and are not appetizing looking at
all. (They taste okay though.) Well, this year I brought them in the
house so they wouldn&apos;t melt and now they are driving me nuts. Every
time I walk past that drawer, they shout out, &quot;Taste me! Taste me!&quot;
Sometimes I wake up in the night and can hear them calling me. Being
the humane person that I am, I&apos;ve been helping them out by tasting
them...again and again and again. (One good deed deserves another.)
Which goes back to one of my basic suggestions. If you have it in
the house, no matter how good your intentions are, you&apos;ll probably eat
it.
 
Do as I say. Not as I sometimes do.

 Faddasser Sandi is graduating from high school on Sunday. There will

 In honor of Poetry Day 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall
Do you have to tell it all?
Where do you get the glaring right
To make my clothes look just too tight?
I think I&apos;m fine, but I can see
You won&apos;t cooperate with me;
The way you let the shadows play
You&apos;d think my hair was getting gray
What&apos;s that, you say? A double chin?
No, that&apos;s the way the light comes in;
If you persist in peering so
You&apos;ll confiscate my facial glow,
And then if you&apos;re not hanging straight
You&apos;ll tell me next I&apos;m gaining weight;
I&apos;m really quite upset with you
For giving this distorted view;
I hate you being smug and wise---
O, look what&apos;s happened to my thighs!
I warn you now, O mirrored wall,
Since we&apos;re not on speaking terms at all,
If I look like this in my new jeans
You&apos;ll find yourself in smithereens!

No bonfire this Friday because of all the graduation festivities in

 Tip for Today 
 What &quot;lean&quot; means...
 When reading meat labels that say &quot;Lean,&quot; remember that doesn&apos;t
mean &quot;fat-free.&quot; It means that there are less than 10 grams of fat per
serving. Be sure you check the serving size because you could be
consuming 20 grams and thinking it&apos;s just a small portion.

 A
woman pulled into a crowded parking lot and rolled down her windows to
ensure that her Labrador Retriever had enough fresh air. The dog was
stretched out on the back seat, and the driver wanted to impress upon
him that he must remain there. She walked to the curb backwards,
pointed her finger at the car and said emphatically, &quot;Now you stay. Do
you hear me? Stay! Staaay!&quot;

A man, sitting in a nearby car, gave her a strange look and asked, &quot;Why
don&apos;t you just put it in park ?&quot;

 The Emperor&apos;s new clothes...
 There are a lot of scams out there, but
the biggest scam of all is one we put over on ourselves. And what is
that? Sizes. We have sweet-talked ourselves into believing that
the
smaller the clothing size, the better we look. It doesn&apos;t matter how
much more flattering and comfortable a larger size is, we squeeze our
bodies into the smallest size possible. Then we proudly say, &quot;Yes, I
wear a size 10.&quot; Or, for the men, &quot;Oh yeah, I have a 32&quot; waist.&quot; It
doesn&apos;t matter that the seams look like they&apos;re going to pop any
minute. We&apos;re wearing a smaller size . It doesn&apos;t matter that we
can&apos;t sit down comfortably or bend over without splitting a seam. We&apos;re
wearing a smaller size . It doesn&apos;t matter that one or more of our
limbs tingle with numbness. We&apos;re wearing a smaller siz e.

Remember the story of the emperor who was conned into thinking he was
wearing a beautiful set of clothing, when, in fact, he was naked as a
jaybird? It took the voice of a small child to break into the reality
of the situation. The child remarked on what he saw. The man was buck
naked. If your clothing is tight, you&apos;re not fooling anyone. It&apos;s right
there for the world to see. &quot;June (or Jean or Jane) is busting out all
over.&quot; 

 Be true to yourself. Buy comfortable clothing and don&apos;t worry
about the size. If someone put a different label in a size 20...a label
that read Size 16 ...some of us would jump at the chance to buy
it, because it is a smaller size and we&apos;d wear it proudly, with a
big
smile on our faces. Don&apos;t let sizing rule your life. It&apos;s just a con
game. Be comfortable.

 Thar she blows!
 I&apos;ve always used whale jokes to counter questions
about why I don&apos;t go swimming. Like, &quot;If I go in the water, Green Peace
will start circling.&quot; Or...&quot;Not wearing a swimming suit is my
contribution to beautifying America.&quot; It&apos;s easy for skinny people to
say, &quot;Pshaw! Just go enjoy yourself. Don&apos;t worry about what people
think.&quot; That&apos;s because people think they look pretty darn good. It&apos;s
not like it&apos;s going to be a huge surprise (pun!) to anyone. My clothing
doesn&apos;t camouflage my body that much. It&apos;s just that in a swim suit you
are SO exposed. If I want to bare anything, I&apos;ll bare my soles and go
without shoes. That&apos;s the extent of baring anything for me.

Each of us has our own little fetishes about how we look or don&apos;t look.
We&apos;re never quite perfect enough. I know girls who are gorgeous who
think their thighs are too big or their eyes too close together. We
need to love ourselves and appreciate the bodies God gave us. There are
those who would love to have thighs of any kind or eyes that can see.

Love yourself. And here, indeed, I need to practice what I preach.

 Raising money for Leukemia...
 Faddasser Polly (our bride of
only a month) sent me this e-mail. She is training for the Twin Cities
Marathon and raising money for leukemia. Read on. 
 Hi Jean,

I just wanted to pass on to you and the other Faddassers that I am
raising money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and training for the
Twin Cities Marathon - October 7, 2007.

In return for my training (running every Wednesday and Saturday with my team) we
are asked to raise $1700.00 for the Society. 75% of this money will go
directly to the Society for research, patient aid and education.

Can you give me a summary of what type of Leukemia Nina has and if her
family is in contact with the Leukemia Society. My team had an &quot;honored
Teammate&quot; that we are running for. His name is Colton Friendshuh and he
is 6 years old. He has ALL - Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - and will be off
his chemo this December.

I would like to pass Nina&apos;s story on to my teammates as we share information
on people we are running for and are affected by blood cancers.

My fund-raising website is :

and my marathon weekly blog is :

job, Polly! Nina, too, has ALL. We&apos;ll do what we can to support you,

 ...Today is Night
Baseball Day
...Today is Escargot Day

 Turn on the lights...
 It may come as a shock to you younger Faddassers, but
there was a time when outdoor events were held only during daylight.
Gradually, more outdoor fields became lighted, but for the best part of
my youth, we watched the local games on Sunday afternoons. The addition
of outdoor lighting gave us not only more time for entertainment, but
extended our grazing time. You could now eat hot dogs and popcorn and
drink soda and beer late into the night.

Surveys show that evening is the time most people eat food that is
unhealthy for them. They have to have a soda or beer in their hands
while they watch the telly. They stand with the refrigerator door open
and stare wide-eyed at the little bulb, hoping that something yummy
will miraculously appear on the shelves. Sometimes they become so
bored, they scavenge in the cupboards and eat all sorts of foods that
they wouldn&apos;t normally consider: unsweetened chocolate squares, canned
cake frosting, hard marshmallows. Help yourself avoid bad habits and
boredom by doing something: play a game, read a book, weed the garden,
go for an evening stroll. The less food you eat after 5 PM, the better
you&apos;ll feel. That food often lays in your stomach and then jumps into
the passing bloodstream and heads right for your hips.

 The Grapevine 
 It seems like I&apos;m still back in Ireland. It was cloudy and damp most
of the time we were there and that&apos;s what it&apos;s been ever since I came
home. Kind of hard on my arthritic joints, but then I remember that I&apos;m
retired and can rest whenever I feel like it. Yes!

Our triplets are eight years old today. My, how the years have sped by.
Seems like only a couple of years ago and we were burping and changing
and rocking them to sleep. Now they&apos;re almost third graders.

Reminder that the bonfire is tomorrow night at Baldy&apos;s Bend at the
Baldwin Farm. If you want to go and don&apos;t know where it is, just let me
know. I give great directions. Just ask Lyle. (In the 45 years we&apos;ve
been married, he says he should have learned by now, but when I say,
&quot;Turn!&quot;...he turns. Probably why we&apos;ve stayed together this long. He
knows that if &quot;Mama ain&apos;t happy, ain&apos;t nobody happy.&quot;) :-) 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Sometimes it&apos;s best to not know what you&apos;re eating...

 ...Today is World
Turtle Day
...Today is Bifocals Day
...This is Friends Week

 As fast as a turtle...
 The old fable about the turtle and the hare emphasizes
patience and perseverance. We would all like to see our weight go down
quickly, but, unfortunately, that&apos;s not the way it works. Some of the
fad diets have a big weight loss the first few weeks, but the weight
usually comes back within a short time and brings a few more pounds
with it. Just as the turtle won the race with the hare, we can win the
weight-loss race. We need to keep our eating habits on a steady, even
keel and remember moderation. There&apos;s always tomorrow. All the food
doesn&apos;t have to be consumed today. It&apos;s not like the ancient times when
you had to eat the food before it spoiled. We now have refrigeration to
keep the foods fresh.

Continue to be patient, practice moderation, and eat healthy foods.
When you cross the finish line, it won&apos;t matter who&apos;s first. You&apos;ll
still be a winner.

 The Grapevine 
 The bonfire is at Stan and Phyllis Baldwin&apos;s farm on Friday night
about 7. We go down to Baldy&apos;s Bend and watch the river as we enjoy the
fire, the food, and the fellowship. Bring your chairs and fishing
equipment, if you&apos;d like to fish. Contrary to public opinion, Uncle Dan
is not the community tackle center. What if he hides his tackle box
this year? What will you do? Bring your own fishing equipment.

Today is World Turtle Day...the Hoidal&apos;s day to celebrate. Lyle was
known as &quot;Hoidal the Toidal&quot; by many friends. In fact, his friend,
Lizard, still calls him Turtle to this day.

Sandy Rager (Nina&apos;s grandma) is coming back to Montevideo today and
will spend some time in the Monte Hospital. Nina&apos;s Dad, David Buchanan,
has come down with strep throat so there&apos;s concern about Nina catching
that since her immunity is low. The saga continues. Please continue to
pray for them and for each other.
 
 Tip for Today 
 On a clear day... 
Since this is Bifocals Day, let an old trifocals-wearer give you some
advice. Clean your glasses . It&apos;s amazing how much better you
can see! Many of us who have worn glasses for a long time forget about
that and keep peeking around the fingerprints. Clean lenses are like a
miracle. It&apos;s a whole new world.

 In a pickle...
 Are you in a pickle when it comes to losing weight?
Most of us are. Like some pickles, life tends to get a little sour when
we don&apos;t lose weight quickly. Along with moderation, we also need
patience. Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day, and neither were our thighs and
bellies. (Although it seems like the cellulite pops up like
mushrooms...overnight. Weight is an intriguing thing. It takes only a
few bites and a day and you&apos;ve gained five pounds, but when it comes to
taking it off, it takes weeks. It just doesn&apos;t seem fair.)

Pickles are cucumbers in brine. Cucumbers are vegetables. So a pickle
is a vegetable...right? Not according to the USDA. Schools can&apos;t count
pickles as a vegetable. However, when looking for a snack, don&apos;t forget
pickles. Although they have very little nutritional value, they make a
tasty, crunchy, fat-free condiment or snack. Example: Ever
tried a dill pickle and peanut butter sandwich? Awesome. Do
keep in mind that one pickle can contain over half of an adult&apos;s
suggested daily supply of sodium.
 
Share with us your favorite recipes that use pickles as we celebrate
Pickle Week.I&apos;ll pass them on.

 Delightful Dills 
Here is a way to make you relish plain dill pickles.
 1 quart plain dill pickles
2 cups sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
Celery seeds, if desired 
Drain pickles, reserving liquid. Cut pickles into chunks and return to
jar. Add sugar and vinegar and fill remaining space in jar with the
original pickle juice. Seal. Keep turning upside down until sugar
dissolves. Refrigerate for about a week before you sample them. They&apos;re
very good.

 Day 351
 ...Today I&apos;m home!
...Today is Waitstaff Day
...Today is Greek Philosopher&apos;s Day

 It&apos;s good to be home!
 Traveling is fun, but it&apos;s oh, so good to be home. We
were up for 23 hours straight yesterday, which is really tough for the
woman who thinks staying up until 9 PM is staying up late. For two
grandmas, we did pretty darn good. Got there and got home again. (Thank
you, Lord!) We had a good time and saw a lot. Met lots of interesting
people and ate too much food...everything that you desire in a vacation.

I am going to wait until tomorrow morning to weigh. It&apos;s a 50-50 deal;
I may or may not have gained. Haven&apos;t a clue. We had some very rich
desserts, but then we often had only a short time at a fast-food place
for lunch (if we got lunch at all) so maybe it evened out. We&apos;ll see.
Not going to worry about it. I enjoyed every bite and now I need to get
down to business again. I bought a pair of cropped pants on my way to
Sandy&apos;s and they were a size smaller and not tight and they still fit
so that&apos;s encouraging.

Hope you have all practiced what I preach better than I have. ;-) 

 The Grapevine 
 So many things happened while I was gone. The good news: Nina&apos;s
blood count is where they hoped it would be and her Grandma Gail&apos;s eye
surgery was a success. She can see without glasses. Before the surgery,
she couldn&apos;t even see with glasses. On the down side, Nina has
had some nausea with her chemo, but it doesn&apos;t seem to last too long
and she has beautiful, patriotic hair: red, white and blue. Her Grandma
Sandy was airlifted to St. Cloud yesterday, but things seem to be
looking good there, too. Gail and Bob&apos;s grandson in Iowa was burned
when he fell into a bonfire and will be having a skin graft soon so
things are looking pretty good there, too. This is all in the Buchanan
family...more than any family should have at one time, but they have
their faith in God and know that His will will be done. 

 Tip for Today 
 Waitstaff Appreciation 
Think about the waiters and waitresses you know and say a prayer for
them. They put up with a lot so that we can enjoy ourselves. We had
waitstaff of many different nationalities on our trip. Besides being
hard of hearing and having lots of background noise, with their heavy
accents, I couldn&apos;t understand what they were saying. I think they were
a little frustrated at times, but then, so was I.

In some of the fancy hotels we stayed at, we had so much silverware
that it took one person to run around and grab the ones we weren&apos;t
using for the next course. I don&apos;t know why they couldn&apos;t have just
left them, but then what do I know? At our house, we hardly go
beyond
a knife, fork and spoon. (And sometimes not all three, and sometimes (HORRORS!) they&apos;re only plastic!)

 Good friends...
 After I did the &quot;Fair Warning&quot; Fadd Gram yesterday, I
got a message from the daughters of my traveling companion, Sandy.
Their names are Jennifer and Polly and they have volunteered to send
out Fadd Grams from time to time while I&apos;m gone. Aren&apos;t friends great?

Haven&apos;t started to pack, but I did wash a few clothes and have a good
idea what I&apos;m going to take. There&apos;s not a huge selection in my
wardrobe...the choices are mostly which black ones should I take. My
friend Deanna thinks that I lack color, but you can&apos;t go wrong with
black.

Will see you when I get back.

 No update on Nina. She goes in tomorrow for more chemo. There are

Or send checks to the Co-op Credit Union, P. O. Box 447, Montevideo, MN

 Fair warning...
 When you watch PBS and the antique auctions, as the
bidding ends, they always hit the stand with the gavel and say, &quot;Fair
warning.&quot; This is my fair warning to you that I am leaving for Ireland,
Wales and England Thursday morning and will not be back until Monday,
May 21st. Originally, I thought I would write Fadd Grams ahead of time
and have Friend Deanna send them daily, but deep inside I knew it would
never happen because I&apos;m not even close to being organized. I&apos;m going
to the &quot;auld country&quot; to rest; to inhale the fragrance of peat and gaze
at the sheep on the hillside; to do nothing. I heard one day that the
only bad thing about doing nothing is you don&apos;t know when you&apos;re done.
I&apos;m sure the people on the tour will guide me to my homeward flight and
then I&apos;ll know I&apos;m done. Perhaps I&apos;ll even sing so everyone will know
it&apos;s over. :-) 

 While I&apos;m gone, go back to the early weeks of Fadd Grams and read
them. For some of you it will be brand new stuff; the rest of you
probably won&apos;t remember. I&apos;m going to enjoy myself. You enjoy
yourselves also...in MODERATION!

 Nina continues to persevere, but it isn&apos;t easy, especially for a
child. Keep her and her family in your prayers and also pray for her
Grandma Gail, who is having eye surgery next week.

As I sit here, there are two bright yellow finches at the yellow bird

 Tip for Today 
 Evaporate the calories 
If you like cream in your coffee or on your cereal, chill a can of
evaporated skim milk and use that instead. It has a creamy taste and
very few calories. I use evaporated skim milk all the time in my
cooking. It gives the cream flavor without the guilt.

 Ole and Lena were lying in bed one
night. Ole was falling asleep, but
Lena was in a romantic mood and wanted to talk. She said, &quot;You used to
hold my hand when we were courting.&quot;
   Wearily, Ole reached across, held her hand for a
second, and rolled
over to try to fall asleep.
   A few moments later she said, &quot;Then you used to kiss
me.&quot;
   Mildly irritated, he leaned across, gave her a peck
on the cheek,
and settled back down to sleep.
  Thirty seconds later she said, &quot;Then you used to bite my
neck.&quot;
  Angrily, he threw back the bed clothes and got out of bed.
  &quot;Where are you going?&quot; she asked.

 Keeping their heads and hearts warm...
 The local newspaper ran a story on the knitted caps
that have been sent to the troops in Iraq. The young marine who
inspired it all was home and several of us got to meet him. He brought
an autographed USMC flag that is now hanging on the wall of Donna&apos;s
Delights, the yarn shop where it all started.

Faddasser Kay from St. Cloud is mentioned in there, but not by name.
She took up the challenge and, without knowing the details,  just
did it . She had nine caps waiting at the clinic when I arrived for
my next appointment. Minnesota Nice is alive and well. It makes me so
proud that I can&apos;t stop smiling.

 Nina is home for a few days. They arrived last night and will have
to go back again Thursday. Read this week&apos;s Devotional for a little
more information. We visited her on Saturday and the Children&apos;s
Hospital in Saint Paul was really impressive. When they say
&quot;Children&apos;s&quot; hospital...that&apos;s exactly what they mean. It is for the
children. Nina played Bingo on the TV in her room, where the show was
hosted on the in-house network. When you have a winner, you just pick
up the phone, dial, and announce: &quot;This is Nina in Room 4232 and I have
a BINGO!&quot; We had to provide photo IDs and then they took our pictures
and made badges. (Sorry we can&apos;t share those pictures, too, but they
&quot;accidentally&quot; got destroyed when we got back to the car. We looked
like Bonnie and Clyde&apos;s grandparents on a bad day in the home.)
 
 Tip for Today 
 Nature&apos;s Snack 
 According to the National Raisin
Company, &quot;raisins are the original
candy—nature&apos;s candy. They are one of the most nutritious dried fruits
in the world. Raisins are cholesterol-free, low in sodium and totally
fat-free. They provide many necessary vitamins and minerals, including
iron, potassium, calcium and certain B vitamins. Raisins are a good
source of fiber and rich in antioxidants.
Raisins are 70% pure fructose (a natural form of sugar) which is easily
digested for quick energy!&quot; Pediatric dentists, however, caution that
although they&apos;re a healthy food, they&apos;re also a sticky and have a high
sugar content. When stuck to the teeth for a period of time, they help
promote cavities. Like everything else, you need to know &quot;when to hold
&apos;em and when to fold &apos;em.&quot; Eat them. Enjoy them. Brush well.

also did the spinal tap and her first dose of chemo. She was out of

 Tip for Today 
 HEALTHY RASPBERRY POPOVERS    
 Cooking
Time: 25-30 minutes
Number of Servings: 8
Preparation Time: 20 minutes

 You Will Need 
Cooking spray
1 cup plain flour
Pinch of salt
1 teaspoon sugar 
2 eggs
1 cup 1% milk
1/2 cup raspberries
1 tablespoon confectioners&apos; sugar

 What to Do 
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Coat an 8-cup muffin pan or popover
pan
with cooking spray.

2. To make the popovers, sift the flour, salt, and sugar into a mixing
bowl and make a well in the center. Break the eggs into the well, add
the milk, and beat together with a fork. Using a wire whisk, gradually
work the flour into the liquid to make a smooth batter.

3. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. They should
be about 2/3 full. With a spoon, drop a few raspberries into the batter
in each cup, dividing them equally.

4. Bake in the middle of the oven until the popovers are golden brown,
well risen, and crisp around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes.

5. Using a knife, unmold the popovers and dust with confectioners&apos;
sugar. Serve hot. Eat and celebrate Raspberry Popover Day.

 During
the Sunday service, a small boy became restless and starting kicking
the pew ahead of him. He stood up and stared at the people behind him.
Then he started talking and wouldn&apos;t be quiet. Exasperated at his son&apos;s
behavior, the father picked him up and headed for the back of the

 Brothers and Sisters Day...
 There were many times when I was young that I would
have gladly left the &quot;r&quot; out of &quot;brother&quot; and made it &quot;bother.&quot; My kids
were the same way. They irritated each other to no end, but now they&apos;re
best friends and talk with each other almost every day. It&apos;s amazing
how time can change things. How long has it been since you talked to
your sibling(s)? Why not give them a call tonight? You never know when
it is your last chance to talk with them. Do it now and you won&apos;t
regret it later.

 Tons of news on the Grapevine...
First of all, Nina, a spot of sunshine in our church family, was
diagnosed with leukemia yesterday. The good news, if there can be good
news with leukemia, is that it is the ALL kind, which responds the best
to treatment. She is just finishing second grade and has not been
feeling well for quite some time. Every Sunday we get an update, and
sometimes her medical terminology is &apos;way over our heads. She began
chemo today at Children&apos;s Hospital and will be down there with her
family for the next five days. Please pray for the family. Pray for
Nina. Pray for each other.

Good news from Faddasser Mark: His vision should eventually return to
normal. It&apos;s a rather fuzzy world for him right now, but with his weird
sense of humor, a fuzzy world is nothing new to him. When you&apos;re
praying for Nina, don&apos;t forget to thank God for Mark&apos;s projected
recovery.

The bonfire for Friday night will be held at Uncle Dan&apos;s house. It was
originally scheduled for Dave and Amy&apos;s, but they&apos;ll be down at
Children&apos;s Hospital. Uncle Dan lives in Watson...307 3rd Street. Looks
like it could be a beautiful night. There weren&apos;t many &quot;willing
workers&quot; who showed up last week so I think there&apos;s still raking to be
done. Any volunteers?

PS --- I&apos;m going to the orthopedic surgeon tomorrow to get a shot of
cortisone in each knee. Please pray for me, too. I&apos;m not crazy about
needles...especially big ones!

 Did you get a May Basket?
 When I was young, the first of May was an exciting
day. We made baskets out of construction paper and delivered them to
the neighbors. The deal was that you laid the basket on the step, rang
the doorbell and then ran and hid. If the person who answered the door
saw you, they were supposed to kiss you. We usually kept well-hidden
when we delivered to the neighbors, but when it came to boys we liked,
we didn&apos;t hide &quot;fast enough&quot; so they would see us and have to kiss us.

Today a lot of people put candy in the baskets. We lived in Spokane,
Washington, and at this time of year there were lilacs and lots of wild
flowers so we filled the baskets with flowers. It was a fun
neighborhood event, but it&apos;s not celebrated everywhere. When I left May
baskets for my fellow employees in Prinsburg, they said, &quot;May baskets?
What are May baskets?&quot;

I hope you got a May basket today. If you didn&apos;t, here&apos;s one from me.
(And you don&apos;t have to kiss me because you can&apos;t see me!! :-) )

 Pray for each other. I know of several of our Faddassers who are
hurting; several who are facing major decisions on health issues;
several who have family problems; and all of us battling the bulge.
Pray for each other. It&apos;s the best thing you can do.

 A great way to lose weight is to eat while you are naked and standing
in front of a mirror. Restaurants will almost always throw you out
before you can eat too much.

 ...Today is Oatmeal Cookie Day
...Today is Hairstylist Day
...Today is Honesty Day

 How honest are you?
 Today is Honesty Day. It&apos;s a day where you are
encouraged to be honest...at least for one day. It&apos;s a little scary, I
think, that we celebrate this day and hope for one day&apos;s honesty, at
best. What happened to our society? Honesty used to be the norm; it was
a given for most people.

My dictionary has one of the definitions of honest as, &quot;Not deceptive
or fraudulent: genuine: honest weight . Now let me ask you a
question. How honest are you about your weight? Are you really unhappy
with it? Are you making a genuine effort to get to a comfortable
weight? I&apos;ve always thought of myself as quite honest, but I&apos;m not sure
if I&apos;m honest about my weight. Sure, I&apos;d like to be thinner, but do I
really want to put effort into losing weight. Maybe it&apos;s time we all
sat down and gave ourselves a little pep talk.

 Got to meet with our Marine, Matt Olson, today. He&apos;s home on leave
and he brought an autographed marine corps flag to Donna&apos;s Delights.
He&apos;s a tall, thin, good-looking young man. I didn&apos;t realize how thin
until I put my arm around him for a picture. I&apos;m sure my thigh is
bigger around. The difference is he&apos;s all muscle. We proud of what he&apos;s
doing for his country and we&apos;re proud of him. Welcome home, Matt, and a
BIG THANK YOU from all of us.

The bonfire this Friday night will be at the Buchanan Farm. Dave and
Amy and family are hosting. They live on the old Gippe farm between
Watson and Montevideo. It&apos;s a great place for a bonfire. Very rustic
and a good fire pit. If you can make it, hope to see you there!

Faddasser Mark went to St. Cloud today to see an ophthalmologist.
Yesterday he got hit in the eye with a bungee cord. His vision was a
little cloudy and I&apos;m sure it was painful so he was told to go to St.

 An Honest Smile for Today 
 An investment counselor decided to go out on her own.
She was shrewd
and diligent, so business kept coming in, and pretty soon she realized
that she needed an in-house counsel. She began to interview young
lawyers.

&quot;As I&apos;m sure you can understand,&quot; she started off with one of the first
applicants, &quot;in a business like this, our personal integrity must be
beyond question.&quot; She leaned forward. &quot;Mr. Peterson, are you an
&apos;honest&apos; lawyer?&quot;

&quot;Honest?&quot; replied the job prospect. &quot;Let me tell you something about
honest. Why, I&apos;m so honest that my father lent me $15,000 for my
education, and I paid back every penny the minute I tried my very first
case.&quot;

&quot;Impressive. And what sort of case was that?&quot;

The lawyer squirmed in his seat and admitted, &quot;He sued me for the
money.&quot;

...Tomorrow is International Dance Day

 Hasten slowly... 
Have you ever eaten on the run? Have you eaten standing up? Have you
had a meal in your vehicle while you&apos;re driving or riding? I&apos;m afraid
most of us have. Until I started taking the time to think before I ate,
my standard breakfast was two pieces of toast that I polished off in
the car while I drove the three blocks to work. I arrived every day
with crumbs on my chest and sometimes a little peanut butter in the
corner of my mouth. I think it all started in grade school when we had
to eat fast or there wouldn&apos;t be time to hit the playground; and in
high school, where we had band practice during lunch hour. Somehow I&apos;ve
gotten away from actually sitting down and enjoying my food or, if I do
sit down, doing something else at the same time. Did you know that
actually chewing your food more than two chomps is greatly recommended?
When you think about it, what good is shoving something down so quickly
that you don&apos;t even taste it? Food that gets a running start just
rushes down to the hips and the belly.
 
For the next few days, why not trying eating only when you&apos;re seated at
the table or in a dining area? I was going to leave it at &quot;only when
you&apos;re seated,&quot; but I had visions of someone in a Lazyboy surrounded by
food and beverages. Sit down, enjoy the food, chew it and, as I&apos;ve said
before, savor it. Concentrate on the food and the good
taste. If you work on it, I think you&apos;ll be surprised how many
times you&apos;re tempted to grab something...and most of the time, you&apos;re
not even hungry. If you&apos;re going to eat, make it worthwhile.

 The zipper beat the

designers raved over
zippers in men&apos;s trousers. Esquire magazine declared the zipper
the &quot;Newest Tailoring Idea for Men&quot; and among the zippered fly&apos;s many

 ...Today is Arbor Day
...Today is Morse Code Day
...Today is Child Care Professionals Day

 A tree grows...
 Today is Arbor Day, a day that should be very
important to the citizens of the world. Have you ever stopped and
studied a tree? They are magnificent plants. There&apos;s nothing more
comforting than sitting in the shade of a tree with the wind gently
rustling the leaves. They become sanctuaries. Why not celebrate Arbor
Day and plant a tree? Besides being good for the environment, they&apos;re
good for the soul. We planted some at our Black Oak place about 20
years ago and it&apos;s hard to believe how large and lovely they are. It&apos;s
also hard to believe that it&apos;s been 20 years.

As Joyce Kilmer said in his poem, &quot;Trees&quot;...
 
 I think that I
shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree. 

 A tree whose
hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth&apos;s sweet flowing breast; 

 A tree that
looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 

 A tree that may
in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair; 

 Upon whose bosom
snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain. 

 Poems are made by
fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
 

 You probably grew up with this poem and know it by
heart, but it still bears repeating and it still has a message.

 Am not sure if I&apos;m going to get to the bonfire tonight or not. It&apos;s
been an extremely busy day. I put on several miles in Ramsey Elementary
School today for Grandparents&apos; Day. I&apos;m sure hallways were
shorter
when I was young. It&apos;s also amazing how many of the &quot;young people my
age&quot; are grandparents!

Got this message from Faddasser Al.
 Greetings from Seattle! We have been out here for the week---time goes so fast on a visit! We happened to catch a program on the morbidly obese last night--- folks who weigh 700 pounds or more. Despite surgery, or whatever means, they could not, or would not, control their eating. Very thought provoking. Most had breathing tubes full time and still ate. Made us really think about what we put in our mouth. Felt very sad for them. We need to support each other as we are doing. 

 Think about what you&apos;re doing before you put food in your mouth. And when you do, remember MODERATION. Tip
for Today 
 An apple a day... 
When you&apos;re baking, you can substitute unsweetened applesauce for at
least half of the oil in the recipe. You need to do a little
experimenting. I make bars from cake mix for Lyle&apos;s lunch and the
recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil. I substituted the same amount of
applesauce and they turned out very delicious. I did, however, have to
trim almost a whole row off to taste and make sure they were okay.

 ...Today is Bird Day
...Today is Pretzel Day
...Today is Remember Your First Kiss Day

 Eat like a bird...
 Remember when skinny little
people were said to &quot;eat like a bird?&quot; It sounded like they nibbled a
few seeds and were satisfied. Whatever you do, don&apos;t &quot;eat like a bird.&quot;
To survive, most birds must eat at least half their own weight in food each day. Okay, so that would mean I would have to eat...let&apos;s
see...let me figure this out...Wow! I can&apos;t even lift a 10th of that.
I&apos;d have to have a forklift just to shovel the food in. It would change
the meaning of a &quot;peck of food&quot;...we&apos;d be talking bushels here.

Each species has their own survival mechanisms all built in. We have
one, too, but we&apos;ve lost control of it. Our bodies are very confused as
to whether we&apos;re hungry, starving, or overfed. To keep your metabolism
on an even keel, you need to eat regularly (moderately) and exercise.
Don&apos;t forget to drink water, too. It doesn&apos;t make you fatter.
Dehydration does. So drink, drink, drink! (Water! Water! Water!) 

 The Grapevine 
 Bring a rake. I was reminded that we&apos;re supposed to bring rakes
along to the bonfire on Friday night. We can kill two birds with one
stone...oops! wrong expression for Bird Day. Let me rephrase: we can do
two jobs at one time. We&apos;ll rake up the twigs that have accumulated
over the winter and have good burning material for our bonfire.

Got a reply to my &quot;Cuckoo question&quot; in yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram. 
 &quot;I might be telling tales out of school here, but.... Mom&apos;s is wine and cheese popcorn --- just ask her.
I&apos;m not too far behind. I love the Nook&apos;s cheese curds!... evil little fried grease balls of goodness...&quot; 
 Tip for Today 
 Give your diet a twist with a pretzel 
Pretzels are really good snacks...especially the baked ones. Here&apos;s
some trivia from the Sturgis Pretzel House site.
 
 • Pretzels without salt are
called baldies. 
 • An average
pretzel has no fat and only 110 calories per ounce. 
 • It&apos;s believed
that the fastest twister can make 40 pretzels in a minute. Now that&apos;s
some twisting! 
 • European
culture makes the mid-Atlantic states the nation&apos;s Pretzel Belt.
Per-capita pretzel consumption in these states is 4 pounds a year,
twice the U.S. average. 
• Pretzels are
the third most preferred salty snack food in America --–after potato
chips and tortilla chips, respectively.

 ...Today is Cuckoo Day
...Today is Zucchini Bread Day (Why
this time of the year?) 
...Today is Don&apos;t Step in Dog Doo Day (I swear, I didn&apos;t make this up) 

 Cuckoo for...?
 When my kids were young, there was a very irritating
commercial for breakfast cereal. It had a goofy looking bird who flew
around screeching, &quot;Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs! Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!&quot; It
was enough to make you picket the breakfast food aisle. I&apos;m not cuckoo
for cocoa puffs, but I&apos;m foolish for fudgesicles. Frenzied even.

Each of us has a favorite food; a food that doesn&apos;t work well with
&quot;moderation.&quot; I&apos;ve learned that I have to go without fudgesicles, or
every couple months buy a box, knowing I&apos;m going to eat them all. Life
is too short to not eat them, so it&apos;s time again. I&apos;m trying to make
them last and to eat less at my meals, but once the box is gone, I&apos;ll
be satisfied and can get along for another couple months. It&apos;s not a
good example, but it works for me.

What are you cuckoo for and how do you handle it?

 The Grapevine 
 I could not for the life of me think of the word &quot;picket.&quot; I had
blockade, strike...but &quot;picket&quot; wouldn&apos;t surface. I called a friend and
while I was explaining to her, the word popped right into my mind. So I
thanked her, said goodbye, and continued with the Fadd Gram.

Our special Marine, Matt Olson, is now home from Iraq. Remember him? We
sent all the caps to him to distribute to his company. It&apos;s so
wonderful to know that he&apos;s home and safe. Our neighboring town of
Willmar had a local soldier who returned in a casket. His funeral was
today. God&apos;s plans are often hard to understand, but &quot;ours is not to
reason why.&quot;
 
 Tip for Today 
 They don&apos;t fly on a diet... 
Chicken wings seem like they&apos;d be a good choice when eating out. Not
so. There&apos;s almost no meat, but lots of fatty skin. You&apos;re better off
with a piece of skinless chicken breast. More meat and much healthier.

Just
after I got married, I was invited out for a night with &quot;the boys.&quot; I
told the missus that I would be home by midnight ... promise! 
 Well,
the yarns were being spun and the grog was going down easy and at
around 3 AM, full as a boot, I went home. Just as I got in the door,
the cuckoo clock started, and cuckooed three times. Quickly I realized
she&apos;d probably wake up, so I cuckooed another nine times. I was really
proud of myself, for having been quick witted enough, even when
smashed, to escape a possible conflict. 

 Next
morning the missus asked me what time I got in. I told her 12 o&apos;clock.
(Whew! Got away with that one!) 

 She
then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock. When I asked her why,
she said, &quot;Well, it cuckooed three times, said &apos;Dang it;&apos; cuckooed
another four times, hiccuped; cuckooed another three times,
cleared
its throat; and then cuckooed twice and giggled.&quot;

 ...Today is Ambivalence Day
...Today is Plumber&apos;s Day
...Today is Pigs in a Blanket

 Should I or shouldn&apos;t I?
 Why pick just one day? For me, every day is
Ambivalence Day. Should I eat it (it would taste very good and I
deserve it ) or shouldn&apos;t I eat it ( do I want to look like a pig
in a blanket? ) It&apos;s not only food. You have choices every day and
when you don&apos;t know what choice to make, you are ambivalent. As
Faddassers, you know you can do it. If you use moderation, even if the
choice of food is wrong, it won&apos;t be totally wrong because
you&apos;ve only eaten a small portion. Unless it&apos;s salmonella, a small
portion isn&apos;t going to hurt you. Make the decision; make the decision
to eat healthy. Make the decision to practice moderation. And make the
decision to exercise. No ambivalence for us! We know where we&apos;re headed
and we know the choices we need to make to get there.

 Our bonfire this week is going to be at the Evangelical Church in

 Tip for Today 
 Berry good and berry delicious 
The berries are back: strawberries, raspberries and blueberries are now
available. Keep a dish of them ready in the refrigerator and you can
use them on cereal, desserts, and ice cream. Fresh raspberries added to
peach sauce is very good. Even better when the fresh peaches are
available.

...Today is Shakespeare&apos;s Birthday (See my sonnet below) 

 To eat or not to eat...
 To eat or not to eat: that is the question.
Whether &apos;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The pangs of hunger or to take arms full of food
And satisfy temptation.
By opposing pangs we do not die; we sleep with stomachs full.
Forget the heartache; go for moderation and
The thousand natural calories that adhere to flesh.
&apos;Tis a consumption devoutly to be wish&apos;d.

darn good sonnet.)

 Two weeks and three days and I&apos;ll be on my way to Ireland. The info
that I got Friday says that my great-great grandfather and his brother
came to America from Dublin in 1845. One of their sisters married a
ship captain and so during the potato famine in 1846-47, he loaded all
the rest of the Abbott family onto his ship and took them to Christ
Church, New Zealand, where they were some of the earliest settlers. The
story in America is just like a movie. The brothers marry English
sisters. One brother is killed in the Civil War. The other goes to Fort
Snelling and follows the cavalry to Miles City, Montana; his wife dies
of tick fever; he brings his family down the Missouri River in a
flatboat during flood stage; one son is killed by Indians in Kansas.
I&apos;m really excited. 

 Tip for Today 
 Piecing together dessert 
If you could just die for pie, make a smart choice. Choose a
single-crust pie, preferably with a fruit filling. A big share of the
fat is in the pastry crust so you&apos;ll have less fat grams &quot;any way you
cut it.&quot;

calories.

 Boil and bubble means less toil and trouble
 Don&apos;t forget about putting hot dogs in boiling water to prepare
them. A good share of the fat is melted and left in the water. Someone

the water used to cook the wieners. We never had that. Did you? Someone

she sent me some information on my Irish roots. My great-great

given to the historical society. Since the brothers married sisters and
followed the same path through much of their lives, it has given me
lots of information. I&apos;m so excited that I can hardly wait to get the
Fadd Gram done so I can read it again and do some more research. I
don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be too excited to eat, but if I were a betting lady,
my money would be placed on my appetite.

 It&apos;s getting so nice out that one of these Friday nights we&apos;ll be

 ...Today is Primrose Day
...Today is Garlic Day

 Are you being served?
 When was the last time you had your food &quot;served&quot; to
you at home? Do you even take the time to sit down together for the
evening meal? Today I was talking with one of our Faddassers who has
lost 30 pounds this past year. She said the most helpful thing she&apos;s
done is to &quot;serve&quot; the food. That is, she places the food on the plates
and then puts the food away. When she brings the plates to the table,
there is no question of seconds because the food is tucked in the
refrigerator and on its way to being chilled. By doing this, she can
control the portion sizes. When you know you&apos;re not getting seconds,
you&apos;re more apt to &quot;savor&quot; what you have and chew more slowly. This
isn&apos;t being stingy...it&apos;s being practical. How many times have you gone
for &quot;seconds&quot; when you were already full? Food in front of you is hard

he was in had problems and he and the driver had to be rescued. That

...Today is Paul Revere Day

 How beautiful was it?
 It was a gorgeous day and guess where I was?
Working...and I&apos;m retired! Talk about good planning. Oh, well, I have
something to look forward to. Do you realize that it&apos;s been almost a
year since the Fadd Grams began? Only 47 days until our first
anniversary. Have you changed any of your habits? Have you become more
beautiful inside and outside? With the daily cheering sessions and the
weekly devotionals we should have covered both.

Enjoy this beautiful weather and get outside and do something !
Walk, rake, sunbathe...whatever tickles your fancy. After the gloomy
winter, the spring sunshine will bring a whole new glow to your life.

 We must continue to pray for our Faddassers. Each one of us has
something that needs God&apos;s attention. Remember that God is still
working on each of us and there&apos;s still time to change our lives and
the lives of others.

The Credit Union Annual Meeting is tonight and for the first time in 8
years, I don&apos;t have to work. Most of those years, I was in charge of
the shindig and was exhausted the next day. Tonight I&apos;m going to sit
down and visit and enjoy myself. Didn&apos;t eat supper so I can enjoy the
lunch because it&apos;s usually fabulous!
 
 Tip for Today 
 Let the sun shine 
We all know that sunlight triggers enzymes that make us feel better.
Now, according to a recent study, a blast of sunshine could help fight
skin diseases and cancer by attracting immune cells to the skin
surface. Another area where moderation is very important. Too much sun
can also damage skin cells and cause cancer. A happy medium in
all
things is a good goal.

cheese because we&apos;ve been warned that it is too high in fat. Sometimes
that&apos;s true, but like all things, we can practice what? Moderation!

There&apos;s got to something out there that will pique your taste buds. Go

...Today is Eggs Benedict Day
...Today is Patriots&apos; Day (I

...This is Organize Your Files Week (A good idea after shuffling through them to
get IRS data.) 

 Are you aware of your stress?
 Not everyone is. Sometimes we think we have everything
under control and then one tiny thing goes wrong and we see how
vulnerable we really are. Stress is linked to all kinds of illnesses,
including high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke, cancer,
obesity, diabetes, sleep disturbances, fatigue, asthma, depression,
eating disorders, headaches and digestive problems. And that&apos;s just
naming a few.

We need to learn to cope with the symptoms and find cures for the
problems. The following link has some good ideas, but the best advice I
can give you is to see your family physician. Tell him about what&apos;s
happening to you and let him guide through to recovery.

everyone seems to be really enjoying themselves.

I got my taxes finished, filed and confirmed yesterday. Tomorrow
morning the IRS will dip into our checking account. Hope they leave a
little for seed.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Organize your files 
Yes, and while you&apos;re at it, organize your cupboards. If you have a
tasty temptation hiding behind the fruit and vegetables, bring it out
in the open and either take a bite or get rid of it. The longer you
wait, the less apt you are to practice moderation.

 A Less-Stressful Smile for Today 
 Last week a friend of mine went to a
seminar called Stress and Disease by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
expert in psychobiology. He gave an example of a coping skill for job
stress that I would like to share with you. 
 When you have had one of
those TAKE-THIS-JOB-AND-SHOVE-IT days, try this. On your way home after
work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the section where they have
thermometers. You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by
Q-Tip. Be very sure that you get this brand. 

 When you get home, lock
your doors, draw the drapes, and disconnect the phone so you will not
be disturbed during your therapy. Change to very comfortable clothing,
such as a sweat suit and lie down on your bed. Open the package
containing the thermometer, remove the thermometer and carefully place
it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken. 

 Take the written material
that accompanies the thermometer and, as you read it, you will notice
in small print the statement that every rectal thermometer made by
Q-Tip is PERSONALLY tested . 

 Now close your eyes and
say out loud five times, &quot;I am so glad that I do not work in quality
control at the Q-Tip Company.&quot;

my existence most of my life and it isn&apos;t getting any better, except
that as I ease into senility, I have the excuse of not remembering.

We&apos;ve all been guilty of procrastination this past year. We drag our
feet about exercising; we delay moderation while rushing to the table.

...Today is Big Wind Day
 
 Well, blow me over... 
 My grandson and I went on a road trip
today. (His father, my son, thinks of road trips as something else and
is disappointed that I never took him on one.) Quinn and I hit the back
roads and look for birds and animals we wouldn&apos;t see in town. It&apos;s a
good bonding experience and we have a great time. We stopped at the DQ
in Dawson and I thought the door was locked when we went to leave. I
pushed with all my considerable weight behind me and still could barely
open the door. That is a pretty hefty wind.
 
 I&apos;m hoping that one of these days it won&apos;t
take a gale to blow me over...just a gentle breeze. I am down three
more pounds, but haven&apos;t been eating much because I&apos;ve been nauseous
for the past week. (No, I&apos;m not pregnant. Just look that way. As my

 Got this nice response to this week&apos;s devotional, &quot;Empty.&quot;

Just read your weekly devotional and it resonated with me. I
agree that empty is a powerful word/image. I&apos;ve felt so empty at
times
these past months and realized that it&apos;s when I&apos;m empty and relying on
God that I&apos;m open to be filled by God. What a gift we Christians
have
to know that we don&apos;t have to &quot;feel good&quot; to know that God is
working---too bad I&apos;m so hard headed that I need to be emptied to learn
the lessons I&apos;m supposed to learn.

 AMEN to that! Thank you, Faddasser Jean.

 ...Today is Cheese Fondue Day
...Today is Civil Rights Day
...This is Garden Week
...This is Frog Month

 Do you fondue?
 Thirty years or so ago, fondue was very popular. Now
it&apos;s become more of a fon-don&apos;t. We used to always do a hot-oil fondue
on Christmas Eve. It worked great for many years, and then the
grandchildren came along, and hot oil seemed suddenly too dangerous.
One nice thing about fonduing is that you can&apos;t hurry it. You take your
time, chat with your family and friends, and end up eating much less
than you would if you were scooping the food out of a bowl. If you
haven&apos;t had a fondue party for awhile, why not try one. They are fun
and, even with the hot oil, there isn&apos;t enough of it used to clog too
many arteries. Dig out the old fondue pot and celebrate the day. Go to
this website for good suggestions on cheese fondue. http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/fondue.htm

 Tip for Today 
 How do I clean an oral thermometer?
 
 With all the colds and flu going
around, you need to take temps and it&apos;s sometimes confusing to know the
best way to clean the thermometer. Mayo Clinic has this recommendation. 

 Cleaning an oral thermometer is easier
than you think. All you need is soap and water. 

 Wash the thermometer with cool, soapy
water and rinse it with clean
water. Then, let it air-dry or wipe it dry with a clean cloth or paper
towel. Be sure to wash the thermometer before and after each use. 

 You can use rubbing alcohol to clean an
oral thermometer. However,
it isn&apos;t necessary. If you do use alcohol, be sure to rinse off the
thermometer before using it again to get rid of the alcohol taste. --- Mayo

 Today we celebrate the founding of the Salvation Army.
The following paragraph is a good testimonial.
 Identified by author and
management expert Peter Drucker as &quot;by
far the most effective organization in the United States,&quot; The
Salvation Army invests the charitable gifts it receives in the lives of
men and women and boys and girls. 
 &quot;No one
even comes close to it in respect to clarity of mission, ability to
innovate, measurable results, dedication and putting money to maximum
use,&quot; Drucker said. (Forbes, August 11, 1997). 
 According
to the Army&apos;s 2004 annual report, approximately $0.83 of each dollar
spent by The Salvation Army is used to fund direct services for people.
 
We, who have been given so much, should think about giving to those who
are in need. We talked about this verse in Sunday School this week. &quot;Be
careful not to do your &apos;acts of righteousness&apos; before men, to be seen
by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by
men.&quot; --- Mark 6:1-2

 From Faddasser Jodie:
I just got back from the Oncologist, Dr Ryan, and my Chemotherapy is set up to start on April 18th. It will be every two weeks for 4 times. So if everything goes good, my last treatment will be May 30th. The radiation will start one month after the chemotherapy is done. I am feeling good and in a way can&apos;t wait to start this so it can be over. I will be taking the chemotherapy at the Montevideo Hospital---that will be nice to be close to home. They only can give me all the side effects, but everyone is different---so we will have to wait to see how it affects me.

I couldn&apos;t have done it without your support and love.

 For the leftover ham and boiled eggs... 
 Molded Ham and Egg Salad 
2 small packages or 1 large package of lemon Jell-O
2 cups boiled water
1-1/2 cups cold water
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
2 cups finely diced cooked ham
1 cup finely chopped celery
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 hard-cooked egg, chopped

Dissolve gelatin and salt in boiling water. Add cold water and vinegar.
Set aside 1/2 cup. Chill remaining gelatin until slightly
thickened---about 1 hour. Pour reserved gelatin into an 8x4-inch loaf
pan. Chill until set, but not firm (about 15 minutes).

Arrange egg slices on set gelatin. Fold ham, celery, onion and chopped
egg into slight thickened gelatin. Spoon carefully onto gelatin in pan.
Chill until firm (about 6 hours or overnight). Unmold. Garnish with
salad greens.

Note: For an easier way, just make the Jell-O; chill until thickened.
Fold in remaining ingredients, except the sliced eggs. Pour into pan.
Chill until firm. Garnish with the sliced eggs.

Dyngus Day (This is a

Monday in Poland. On this day a peculiar custom is practiced; that is,
a boy would enter the bedroom of a girl he liked and wake her by
completely drenching her with buckets of water. Dyngus Day also
involves exchange of gifts, usually decorated eggs.&quot; How romantic

 She&apos;s gone berserk...
 Mother Nature is showing her age. She&apos;s completely

weather patterns. Sunshine today and the chance of a snowstorm
tomorrow. How crazy is that? Did you see the picture in the paper
titled, &quot;Easter Wonderland?&quot; A couple in Cleveland were taking an
Easter stroll in two feet of snow.

I think sometimes that my eating patterns are just as confused. I was
anticipating eating chocolate yesterday, after abstaining during Lent.
I told my grandson I was going to have a Hershey kiss in my pocket and
as soon as Pastor Bob said, &quot;Amen!&quot; I was going to pop it in my mouth.
Loving little soul that Quinn is, he contemplated calling Bob and
asking him not to say &quot;Amen.&quot;

The thing that is odd is that I really don&apos;t want a Hershey kiss. For
the time being, at least, I&apos;m not craving chocolate. I&apos;m sure if, like
smoking, I &quot;started in again,&quot; I&apos;d really want some. It&apos;s all in our
habits and what we become accustomed to. I may have to extend my
covenant for a few more weeks.

 A delicious way to use up leftover Easter ham 
 ORIENTAL HAM SOUP
 4 cups water
2 cups sliced bok choy
3/4 cup carrots, cut into thin strips
3/4 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry sherry
Dash of pepper
8 ounces fully cooked ham, cut into thin strips (1-1/2 cups)
1/2 cup spinach or regular egg noodles.
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine water, bok choy, carrots,
onion, soy sauce, dry sherry and pepper. Bring to a boil. Add ham and
noodles. Simmer about 10 minutes or until noodles and vegetables are
crisp-tender. Makes 4 servings.
142 calories per serving, 3 grams fat.

NOTE: Bok choy isn&apos;t a native Minnesota vegetable, but it adds
a little crunch to your soup. It looks similar to celery, but has white
stalks and dark green leaves. Slice the stalks and coarsely shred the
leaves. It&apos;s that easy.

Edition
 ...Today is Let Someone Else Clean Day
...Today is Coffee Cake Day
...Today is World Health Day
...Tomorrow is Easter

 Celebrate Easter...
 Like most of our Christian holidays, commercialism has
overshadowed the true meaning. Easter is the time of the resurrection,
a time that should be celebrated on our knees, giving thanks for the
new covenant. Instead, for many, it is a time to buy, buy, buy. It&apos;s
almost a dead heat between buying new clothing and buying candy for the
Easter baskets.

As you celebrate Easter this weekend, remember the sacrifice that was
made for us. Be thankful for the many blessings you have been given and
try to stay out of the candy. The taste of candy is very good for a few
moments, but the flavor of the new covenant lasts forever.

 Portion Distortion...
 Faddasser Mark put my thoughts
into words. Yesterday I was looking at the size of the bowl I eat my
Cheerios in and was wondering how many servings I was actually having.
Then this morning there&apos;s an e-mail from him with exactly the same
thoughts. Let me share it with you. I stopped over and apparently
interrupted mealtime at Faddasser Bob and Gail&apos;s house tonight, and
realized that they are truly following the serving size rule. I looked
at the plates set and saw the small amount of food on the plate.
Because to me it seemed the portions on their plates were incredibly small . After Bob explained portion
size, I realized my huge portion size at home was affecting the huge
PROportion size I have taken on in my body size. So...great going Bob
and Gail for being a good example. I need to do some portion adjusting
myself. Sometimes seeing is believing!

 How about your portions? Are they anywhere near the
suggested serving size? Get a measuring cup down and check...it...out.

resolved. The next step is a referral to the Mayo Clinic
with appointments to be set up with a rheumatologist, neurologist
and
endocrinologist. Hopefully, Kelsey can find out what is going on in her
body and correct it or at least control it.
 Thank you for all your prayers and support. 
Uncle Dan was supposed to be coming home today, but haven&apos;t heard if it
happened. Without that hernia, he&apos;ll blow away in this wind. It&apos;s
ferocious out there!

June 6th will be our Faddasser anniversary. We&apos;d like to have a picnic
so we can meet each other. Let me know if you think you might join us
and if you have a date you can&apos;t make it. We haven&apos;t scheduled anything
yet, so the day is wide open.

Faddasser Jean reported today that she had reached her 30-lb. mark.
Yes, that&apos;s how much she&apos;s lost. She said she has been eating oatmeal
every day for breakfast since last summer, but the last couple of weeks
she switched to fruity yogurt and it pushed her over the top. Good job,
Jean!!!

 Day 302
 ...Passover begins today
...Today is Full Moon Day (Couldn&apos;t
prove it in Montevideo. It&apos;s been overcast for days. Just like being in
dear, auld Ireland again.Only in Ireland, it rains often, but the sun
usually pops out during the day.) 

 Busy, busy...
 I&apos;ve been fighting a cold for the past five days. I&apos;m
helping out at the Credit Union and have a deadline that must be met so
I went back today. Worked Thursday, but didn&apos;t feel up to it Friday. As
a result, I&apos;m getting behind in my Fadd Grams and Devotionals. I worked
until 7 tonight and feel pretty lousy so will make this short.

Here&apos;s the best advice I can give you. Stay out of the Easter candy .
Don&apos;t buy it until Saturday. The prices may be cheaper and in the long
run, even more cost-effective, because you won&apos;t have to replace the
bags you purchased prior to Easter and have now eaten. At least that&apos;s
the way it always worked for this Easter Bunny.

 HEALTH UPDATES: Faddasser Gail went to Sufls to have lasik surgery
today and found out that she has cataracts. She will be having surgery
soon. Uncle Dan is coming home tomorrow so our prayers are being
answered in that direction.

Got a request from Faddasser Jamie to pray for her niece. This is her
message.
 Once again my niece Kelsey is having problems
and is in need of prayers. She is in Duluth. Her blood platelets are
good,
but she is very weak. She has not attended a full week of school since
January. Her DR has ordered chest x-rays and a brain scan as soon as

 ...Today is Bunsen Burner Day
...Today is Lazarus Saturday ( Lazarus Saturday is part of
the Easter celebration of Eastern Orthodox Church and observes the time
when Jesus is supposed to have raised Lazarus from the dead depicting
Jesus&apos; power over life and death. Christians have celebrated the day
before Palm Sunday as &quot;The Saturday Of Lazarus&quot; 
...Tomorrow is Palm Sunday
...Tomorrow is Firefighters Day
...Tomorrow is April Fools&apos; Day

 Get up and do something...
 Since today celebrates the raising of the dead, maybe
it would be a good time for the rest of us to get up off our dead ends
and do something. It&apos;s easy, after a long winter, to sit back with the

Yesterday I wrote in The Grape Vine that Uncle Dan&apos;s tumor was

but evidently the messages from my brain didn&apos;t get as far as my finger

 Thoughts for Today 
 Palm Sunday 
 Two names for the same day: Palm Sunday
and Passion Sunday.   I propose a third
name:
Fickle Sunday.   For the same crowd that was
cheering during the parade was jeering a few days later.   They’d been wowed by his sermons, fed with loaves and fishes,
healed of their diseases, delivered of their demons.   But
as soon as the tide began to turn, so did they.   Their cries of“Hosanna”turned to shouts of a very
different kind:“Crucify him!”

 Day 299
 ...Today is Doctor&apos;s Day
...Today is the Birthday of Vincent Van Gogh (It&apos;s ironic that with all the beautiful
paintings he did, he&apos;s most remembered for cutting off his ear.) 

 Read those labels...
 Just read an interesting article in the USA Weekend that came with our newspaper today. It&apos;s entitled &quot;Low-fat food makes
you fat.&quot;
Author Jean Carper says that although low-fat foods are good for your
health, they are often not good for your waistline. The popular
conception is that low-fat foods have about 40% fewer calories than the
regular one. Not always true. In order to keep the taste, other
ingredients (often corn syrup) are added to enhance the flavor.
Overweight people seem to be the most vulnerable. Because they think
it&apos;s low- cal , too, they eat more. The only way to be sure is to
check those labels. Here is a little comparison that was highlighted in
the article.
 
If you switch to reduced fat 
 You might save a few calories ....
 
 1 Tb. reduced-fat peanut butter has 2 fewer calories
than regular peanut butter 1 chocolate chip cookie has 3 fewer calories 1 cup frozen vanilla yogurt has 4 fewer calories 
 
... or unintentionally add them 
 
 1 cup reduced-fat chicken noodle soup has 20 more
calories than regular 1 cup fat-free half-and-half has 145 to 160 calories
vs. 146 calories in 1 cup whole milk 
 Read
the labels.

 The Grapevine 
 Uncle Dan has had his surgery and, except for a lot of pain, is
recovering. He will be hospitalized a couple of days longer than
originally thought, but at least he&apos;s rid of it. I was told the tumor
was the size of a watermelon. Uffda. Continue to pray for Uncle Dan and
always pray for each other.

Faddasser Gail was talking with Faddasser Phyllis the other day and was
asked how she was doing with those 7 bags of Hershey kisses she&apos;d found
hidden in a drawer. Phyllis was wondering if she was &quot;savoring&quot; them. I
replied with just two words, &quot;Are you?&quot; Gail&apos;s answer was, &quot;How you do
pry! Some days better than others.&quot;

We all have our little hidden stashes in our lives and it&apos;s not always
chocolate.

I brought home several things in my travels this week...one of them a
cold. (Or flu. I never know how to tell the difference.) Whatever it
is, it&apos;s settled in my lungs and is causing a lot of coughing. If it
ain&apos;t one thing, it&apos;s another. Just lovin&apos; this old age stuff.

I was watching the rain just now and listening to the thunder and
wondering why the rain doesn&apos;t make me shrink. It sometimes does for

soaks up stains like a sponge, but doesn&apos;t shrink or wear out.

 Tip for Today 
 Take me out to the ball game 
If you get taken to a ball game, eat healthy foods before you go in the
gate so you can avoid the vendors. Their wares are very tempting, but
they&apos;re also loaded with calories. If the ball park has no restrictions
on bringing in food, bring some fruit and raw veggies and bottled
water. If you have to have a hot dog, have only one and then try to cut
back a little the next day.

 The Grapevine 
 Uncle Dan has been having some serious medical problems and has
developed an extremely large hernia. Because of the size of the hernia
and the pain involved, he will be having the surgery tomorrow instead
of the 13th of April. Please pray for him. Pray for his recovery and
pray that no damage has been done to the kidney he received on January
1st.

Gas prices were interesting on my little getaway. They varied from

 Hot Tub Smile for Today
 Three women...one
German, one Japanese and a redneck...were sitting naked in a hot tub.
Suddenly there was a beeping sound. The German pressed her forearm and
the beep stopped. The others looked at her questioningly.

&quot;That was my pager,&quot; she said. &quot;I have a microchip under the skin of my
arm.&quot;

A few minutes later a phone rang. The Japanese lady lifted her palm to
her ear. When she finished, she explained. &quot;That was my mobile phone. I
have a microchip in my hand.&quot;

The Redneck Woman felt decidedly low tech. Not to be outdone, she
decided she had to do something just as impressive. She stepped out of
the hot tub and went to the bathroom. She returned with a piece of
toilet paper hanging from her behind. The other two ladies raised their
eyebrows and stared at her.

 The
Redneck woman looked over her shoulder and then said, &quot;Well, will you
look at that! I&apos;m getting a fax!&quot;

 Frosty Words for Today
 The
Road Not Taken 
by: Robert Frost
 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth; 
 
 Then took the tother, as just as
fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy ans wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
I took the one less traveled by
And that has made all the difference.

Edition
 ...Today is Pecan Day
...This is Cleaning Week

 Clean up your eating habits...
 Since this week is Cleaning Week, it&apos;s a good time to
also clean up our eating habits. Like our homes, our eating habits can
become a little untidy after continuous use. My biggest problem is
eating too fast. It started back in grade school where we had to eat
our lunch quickly or there wouldn&apos;t be time to go out to the
playground. It continued on through my life: half-hour lunch times,
errands to do, slow service in restaurants. It all added up to a habit
of two-or-three-chomps-and-a-quick-swallow.

I keep talking about savoring your food, but it&apos;s a good point. If you
take the time to enjoy and really taste your food, you will eat less
because you&apos;ve given your body time to assimilate the fact that you&apos;ve
eaten and, as a result, the hunger messages will cease.

Start a new habit. Savor. 
 
 The Grapevine 
 A few medical problems upset my schedule yesterday and so I am, once
again, a day late. (And, as always, a $ short!)

If you don&apos;t think fast food is full of fat, read this message from
Faddasser Bob: 
 Yesterday when we were coming back from
Iowa, we stopped in Hutch at Burger King. Someone in the drive-up ahead
of us ordered a triple whopper, large fries and large drink. I
wondered how much fat the whopper had, so I asked. The lady taking my
order didn&apos;t know so I said I would look it up when I got home. It
took a long time to get our order and when she came back she said,&quot;You
won&apos;t believe it, but there are 82 grams of fat in just the burger!&quot; 
 When they advertise
&quot;fast,&quot; I&apos;m wondering if they&apos;re referring to the time it takes to get
to the thighs! Have you seen the TV ad where all you see is some feet
on a scale and a man&apos;s voice saying something like, &quot; I&apos;ll have a
double
burger...&quot; and the scale rolls up over 200, then he adds, &quot;and a double
order of fries.&quot; The scale whirls and goes to 240 or something like
that. And then he says, &quot;and a double shake.&quot; The needle goes into a
perpetual spin. I think it&apos;s an ad from Subway. Makes you think though.

 Fact or fiction...
 Today&apos;s West Central Tribune had a very
interesting column by Kimberly Asche of the U of M Extension Service.
It was entitled, Some food myths live on . She states that the
International Food Information Foundation recently wrote a new column
on myths and facts about eating. After years of study, they have
determined the following things.
1. No scientific evidence that low-calorie sweeteners increase
the
chance of cancer.
2. Low-calorie sweeteners have no effect on the appetite and do
not
promote weight gain.
3. Fats in food are not bad. Use moderation (where have we heard
that
before?) and keep your intake of trans fat and saturated fat as low as
possible.
4. High fructose corn syrup in average daily amounts do not cause
obesity. &quot;Too many calories, combined with too little exercise is the
primary cause.

Just about any food can harm your body if you eat or drink too much of
it. Remember the woman in Sacramento who died from a water-drinking
contest sponsored by a local radio station? She drank so much water she
drowned herself. It was called &quot;water intoxication.&quot; Too many vitamins
can also be harmful. An excess of Vitamin C can cause degenerative
damage.

Moderation is the key. It will unlock the door to a healthier life.
Moderation in eating. Moderation in exercise.

 Tip for Today 
 How much water is enough? 
 There are many different methods for
calculating daily fluid
requirements. However, a simple equation to help adults figure
their
fluid needs is that for every pound of body weight, you need about half
an ounce of fluid intake per day. For instance, if you weigh 140
lbs.,
simply multiply 140 by .5 to estimate your daily fluid needs in ounces,
then divide by eight to estimate your fluid needs in cups per day,
rounding up to the nearest full cup. [example: 140 x .5 =
70 ounces;
70 ounces divided by 8 = 9 cups of fluid per day]

 0.5 ounces x Body
Weight in Pounds = Daily Fluid Requirement in ounces

 Cool, cool water...
 Most of us have never been really, really thirsty, but
many of us have probably suffered from dehydration. Some of the
symptoms are dry or sticky mouth, low or no urine output, not producing
tears, and sunken eyes. The person may also be lethargic when the
dehydration gets severe. In addition to the symptoms of actual
dehydration, you may also have vomiting, diarrhea, or the feeling that
you &quot;can&apos;t keep anything down,&quot; all of which could be causing the
dehydration. ---Reprinted from Medline Plus, a service of the U.S.
National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.

 Many of you measure out the daily requirement of water each day and
keep it in a container so you can monitor your intake. That is
definitely a good idea. A huge percentage of the population is
dehydrated and they are not aware of it...they just think it&apos;s natural
for them to feel a little &quot;punk.&quot;

So..Drink your water and be thankful that you have clean, fresh water
to drink. Much of the world&apos;s population lives with polluted water. Do
you ever stop to think how blessed we are? You should.

 Lyle got the hand controls out of the handicap van today and then
gave our friend Don and his wife, Marilyn, some operating
instructions. They did a test run and all of them went out for coffee
this afternoon. Don has been in a wheelchair for 11 months so it was a
huge event for him. Isn&apos;t it something, the way we take things for
granted? Things that are almost impossible for other people? He is one
happy man and we&apos;re happy because he is.

Once again, it was illustrated to us yesterday what a small world it
is. On our way to St. Cloud we stopped in Paynesville to grab a cup of
coffee at the Casey&apos;s store. As we were leaving, someone behind me
said, &quot;Hi, Jeanie!&quot; I turned around and there was Dave Anspach from
Montevideo. He was on his way to St. Cloud for therapy. Then when we
were eating at Red Lobster, as I came up from the scampi for air, I
looked ahead and there sat Deanna and Weldy Hodge from Monte...more
friends.

 Good to the last smidgen...
 Lyle and I took an unexpected trip to St. Cloud this
morning to pick up a van for our wheelchair-bound friend. The salesman
suggested that we go have lunch and he&apos;d have everything ready when we
got back. We went to Red Lobster and, I&apos;m ashamed to admit, I did very
little moderation practicing. I had the Shrimp Feast with three
portions of shrimp scampi. As I was sitting there frantically trying to
get the last tidbit out of the shell, I had to laugh out loud at
myself. I had eaten more than a normal helping of shrimp and here I
was, trying to squeeze out the last little morsel. I wasn&apos;t even close
to moderation. In fact, I was greedy!

Since I haven&apos;t been to a Red Lobster in several years, and probably
won&apos;t get to one again for another few years, I doubt if it will become
a habit. It&apos;s okay to overeat once in awhile. After all, if opportunity
is knocking, it isn&apos;t polite to ignore it. So don&apos;t worry about special
occasions. If you stick to moderation the rest of the week, the little
detour should not do much harm. (Well...I&apos;ve talked myself into feeling
better about gluttony. How do you feel?)

 J-E-L-L-OHHHH! 
For some reason, I keep forgetting about Jello. It&apos;s so simple to

made a bowl of plain Jello with mixed fruit. It is a good snack to have
on hand. I already have plans for the next batch. Create different
flavors by using fruit juices or soda instead of the water. Cola is
good with black cherry; lemon-lime soda is good with almost all of the
flavors. The carbonation from the soda provides a little tickle to your

 ...Today is Smile Rejuvenation Day
...This is World Clown Week
...This is Spring Fever Week

 Not only your smile...
 Your smile is not the only thing that could use a
little rejuvenation. Our weight-loss journey could also use a little
boost. I&apos;m getting the feeling that everyone is coasting, not really
putting a lot of effort into it. The bulky, winter coats will be coming
off soon for the summer and you will be exposed to the world. Will you
still look bulky...even with your coat off ? Then maybe it&apos;s
time to start watching what you&apos;re eating and remembering these three
words: moderation...moderation...moderation!

 The Grapevine 
 Had a good chat with Faddasser Julie today. I met her at the gym and
was totally in awe...she ran (not walked, but ran ) on the
elliptical for an hour! She is really shaping up and has a lot of
determination. Maybe some of it will spread to me. I tried a little
bike riding today to strengthen my knees. (&quot;Little&quot; being the key word.
Will see tomorrow how my knee reacts.) 

 Recipe for Today 
 TOMATO DRESSING 
 (5 calories per tablespoon) 
1 8-oz. can of seasoned tomato sauce
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 teaspoon onion juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon each, dill seed and basil
Combine all the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting cover. Shake
until well blended. Chill. Makes about 12 servings.
 (I&apos;m going to try substituting a V-8 for the tomato sauce. I always
have V-8 (the low-sodium kind) on hand.)

 Days
287-288
 ...Today is Let&apos;s Laugh Day (Sometimes that&apos;s all you can do.)
 ...Today
is Act Happy Day ( Get
rid of the blues and be happy.) 
 ...Today is St.
Joseph&apos;s Day (A holy
day to celebrate the earthly father of Jesus) 
...Today is Swallows Day (The
swallows return to San Juan Capistrano. The padres of long ago noted
that the swallows usually returned on St. Joseph&apos;s Day) 

 Act happy...
 Sometimes it&apos;s hard to act happy when everything seems
to be going wrong, but studies have shown that just the act of smiling
and laughing (whether you mean it or not) will boost your endorphins
and make you feel better. If you fake laughter long enough, the real
thing will eventually bubble forth and no more effort will be involved.
Act happy long enough and you eventually will also feel happy.
It may not last for long, but a respite during time of stress is a
healthy thing.

Instead of focusing on how overweight we are, we need to &quot;act happy and
act thin.&quot; If your spirits are high, there&apos;s less temptation to eat and
if you act thin, eventually the feeling will become a habit and you
won&apos;t want to spoil it by overeating. Because the physical aspect of an
overweight body is so obvious, we often forget about the emotional
aspect. Smile, then laugh, and then thank God for the good things you
enjoy and quit concentrating on the downside of life.

 The Grapevine 
 No messages from the Faddassers, but forgot to share last week&apos;s
hair-raising episode. My 10-year-old grandson came upstairs five
minutes before it was time to leave for school. He smiled and said,
&quot;Look, Grandma!&quot; He had shaved off his eyebrows and run the trimmer
down the middle of his head. It was kind of a reverse Mohawk and made
him look like a skunk. He&apos;d also attempted a few swaths on the sides.
We finally got it evened out and made it to school with 5 minutes to
spare. The next day at therapy, the therapist asked me how I like
Quinn&apos;s hair. Appears that his son dared Quinn to shave off his
eyebrows. He added the hair for good measure and guess what he won...a
bottle of glue and a pencil. He is wearing the cap I knit. He found out
just how much his hair had kept his head warm. Kids say the darnedest
things, according to Art Linkletter, but they also DO the darnedest
things. 

 Tip for Today 
 Eating on the run 
It&apos;s easy, when you&apos;re running late, to stop at a fast-food place and
order some kind of a breakfast egg-sandwich. They sound healthy enough,
but they&apos;re loaded with fat and cholesterol...approximately 8 grams of
fat and almost 250 mg of cholesterol. Try a bagel with fat-free cream
cheese instead. Only 3 grams of fat and no cholesterol.

285-286 Weekend Edition
 ...Today is Saint Patrick&apos;s Day 
...Tomorrow is Paper Dress Day
...Tomorrow is Awkward Moments Day
...Tomorrow is Grandparents and Grandchildren Day

 Green is good...
 Today is &quot;wearing of the green&quot;
day...celebrated by everyone who has Irish blood (and many who don&apos;t.)
Green food and green beer are part of the day&apos;s menu, along with corned
beef and cabbage and Irish stew.

Green is good. Have a lettuce salad. Add peas to a hot dish or eat snow
peas raw. Sugar-free instant pistachio pudding is tasty and can be
prepared quickly. Don&apos;t forget green Jello, green eggs and ham, green
beans, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. Green food is usually healthy
and has lots of vitamins so why not practice the &quot;eatin&apos; of the green.&quot;
 
 The Grapevine 
 Just got home from a day-long trip to the Twin Cities searching for
a handicap-accessible van for a friend. No luck, but we learned a lot
about lifts. If you know of any for sale, please let me know. We have a
friend who desperately needs one.

This from Faddasser Gail:
 About cooking vegetables: the microwave is very
good. I cook all our vegetables in it, and because most of them
are
frozen, I don&apos;t add any water. Fresh vegetables are good with
only the
water that remains after you wash them. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 A little splash will do it... 
Instead of high-calorie dressing on leafy, green salads, try a splash
of flavored vinegar. It adds taste and zest to an otherwise rather dull
salad and has no fats or starches.

 ...Today is Everything You Do Is Right
Day...was it?
...Tomorrow is Saint Patrick&apos;s Day
...Tomorrow is Quilting Day
...Tomorrow is Submarine Day

 Temperatures are relative...
 After a week or so of 50-degree weather, we&apos;re
shivering in our socks over 34 degrees. If our weather had been
hovering around zero, we&apos;d be thrilled by 34-degree weather. The heavy
coats would come off and we&apos;d be basking in the &quot;high&quot; temps. Come
autumn, when we&apos;ve grown accustomed to summer heat, we get a real jolt
when the temps drop and our first frost arrives. Temperatures
definitely are relative. 
 
Food portions are relative, too...and definitely relevant! If you are
used to eating huge portions, an average portion looks pretty skimpy.
Once you&apos;ve eaten smaller portions, they become the norm and the old
portions seem gigantic. Reset your body&apos;s expectations and savor the
smaller amounts. Your body will get along just fine on smaller
portions. After all, you have plenty of fat on reserve.

 The Grapevine 
 Just talked with Jodie. The surgery is over, she&apos;s home now, and
all went well. She won&apos;t hear any results until Monday, but the doctors
feel that there&apos;s an 85% chance that everything is okay. Jodie&apos;s
strength comes from her faith in God and He has given her this
opportunity to do a lot of witnessing. Please continue to pray for her
and her family. 

 Tip for Today 
 Cheap and tasty... 
The cheaper cuts of meat can be very tasty when marinated before
cooking. Try a low-fat Italian dressing as a marinade. Your taste buds
will be happy and so will your heart.

---------------
 HEALTH QUESTION&amp;ANSWER SESSION 

 Q : I&apos;ve heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life; is
this true? 
 A : Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that&apos;s it...
Don&apos;t waste them on exercise . Everything wears out eventually.
Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that&apos;s like
saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want
to live longer? Take a nap.  

 Q : Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
 A : You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?
Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing
more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your
system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field
grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of
your recommended daily allowance of vegetable products

 Q : Should I reduce my alcohol intake?
 A : No, not at all. Wine is made from fruit. Brandy is distilled
wine, that means they take the water out of the fruity bit so you get
even more of the goodness that way. Beer is also made out of grain.
Bottoms up!  

 Q : How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
 A : Well, if you have a body and you have fat, your ratio is one
to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one,
etc.  

 Q : What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular
exercise program?
 A : Can&apos;t think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No
Pain...Good!

 Q : Aren&apos;t fried foods bad for you?
 A : You&apos;re not listening....Foods are fried these days in
vegetable oil. In fact, they&apos;re permeated in it. How could getting more
vegetables be bad for you?  

 Q : Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft
around the middle?
 A : Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.
You should only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger
stomach.  

 Q : Is chocolate bad for me?
 A : Are you crazy? HELLO! Cocoa beans! Another vegetable. It&apos;s
the best feel-good food around!!  

 Q : Is swimming good for your figure?
 A : If swimming is good for your figure, explain whales to
me.  

 Q : Is getting in shape important for my lifestyle?
 A : Hey! Round&apos; is a shape! !  


Well, I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had
about food and diets.

 Day 283
 ...Today is the Ides of March...did you
beware?
...Tomorrow is Everything You Do Is Right Day
...Tomorrow is Hiccup Day

 The March wind doth blow...
 Mother Nature is playing a little trick on us again.
It was pretty nice earlier this afternoon and now the wind is bending
the tops of the neighbor&apos;s gigantic pine trees. (I use them as my wind
gauge.) One thing about being a little on the chunky side...the wind
doesn&apos;t push you around much. If I find one that does...I head for the
cellar.

Many times we become a little windy ourselves and talk about what we&apos;re going to do, but we never seem to get it done. If you haven&apos;t
gotten back on schedule, then maybe it&apos;s time to get going. Today is
the middle of March and before we know it, April will be fooling around
the corner. Get out and walk against the wind. It&apos;s good exercise. Or
run. This quote reminds me of my childhood. I can feel the wind go by when I run. It feels good. It
feels fast. --- Evelyn Ashford  

 Get out and feel the wind...feel how fast
it is. 

 The Grapevine 
 Have not heard how Faddasser Jodie is doing. She had surgery
today...a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. She explained the
process in a recent e-mail.
 The sentinel node biopsy will tell if the cancer has spend to my lymph nodes. If my lymph nodes are not clear, then I will stay in the hospital one night. After surgery they will know what treatment I need to do next. I know I will have to do radiation for 5-7 weeks and maybe chemotherapy. A lot of unknowns until they get in to see everything.

We are doing good. The more we learn about this type of cancer, the less scary it is. I am blessed with great family and friends.

 Please continue to keep Jodie and her family in your prayers. She is such a neat lady!

The bird feeders are swinging in the wind so hard that the birds have to hover to land. It&apos;s kind of like when two other people are turning the jump rope and you&apos;re trying to get in to jump. There&apos;s a whole flock of house finches with their bright raspberry breasts flying into the trees and back down to the feeders. Looks like a busy airport. The wind blew a lot of the feed on the ground so the juncos are busy snapping that up.
------
Don&apos;t know about anyone else, but I swear I heard a rumble of thunder earlier this afternoon. Lyle was over at our son&apos;s house and he said he heard it, too. How &apos;bout you?
 Tip
for Today 
 Fable: No pain, no gain 
For years, exercise gurus have been strutting around saying, &quot;No pain,
no gain.&quot; Not true. Don&apos;t injure yourself. Set your own pace, but
exercise regularly. At intervals you can shift into a higher gear for a
few minutes, and then coast for awhile, and then put the pedal to the
metal again. Exercise does not have to be full-bore all the time.
Changing your pace breaks the monotony and gives you a chance to really
get some good exercise in.

 Smile (Hiccup) for Today 
 A man goes into a drug store and asks the
pharmacist if he can give him something for the hiccups.

The pharmacist promptly reaches out and slaps the man&apos;s face.

&quot;What the heck did you do that for?&quot; the man screams.

&quot;Well, you don&apos;t have the hiccups anymore do you?&quot;

The man says, &quot;No I don&apos;t, you IDIOT...But my wife out in the car still
does!&quot;

 Day 282
 ...Tomorrow is the Ides of March
...This is Irish-American Heritage Month

 Beware the Ides of March...
 Remember Shakespeare&apos;s play, Julius Caesar ?
The two most memorable quotes in this play are &quot;Beware the Ides of
March&quot; and &quot;Ettu, Brute?&quot; Ides means &quot;half division&quot; and so it would
mean the middle of March, which was the 15th on the Roman calendar.
Julius, unfortunately, didn&apos;t beware and was murdered.

Although nothing fatal will probably happen, as Faddassers, we should
beware the Backsl ides of March. It&apos;s very easy to slip back into
bad eating habits and head down the backslider&apos;s hill.(In our case, it
would probably be UP the hill since going down would indicate weight
loss.) Don&apos;t let your healthy eating habits melt with the snow.
Practice them faithfully and then when it gets warm, plant them,
nourish them (in moderation) and watch them grow. We need to continue
to develop a healthy life style. It&apos;s a simple thing to do. Let&apos;s get
to it and see what we can accomplish before the ides of April...April
13th.

 The Grapevine 
 Neat response to yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram from Faddasser Gette:
 The
nice weather has me out walking the dogs again, for more than just
the perfunctory &quot;business.&quot; The down side is all the mud and water we
track in. Not only do I walk more, I get more frequent mop
aerobics. Is that good news or bad?

 We think it&apos;s
good news. Thanks, Georgette!
 
 Tip for Today 
 In the raw is healthy 
So, what were you thinking? We mean vegetables. Vegetables and fruits
are much healthier if eaten raw. Heating them destroys some of the
vitamins. Munch and crunch your way to health.

 Irish Smile for Today 
 It seems three Irishmen,
Sean,
Michael and Tim, passed over at the same time. Upon encountering the
Pearly Gates, they were met by Saint Patrick himself, and he addressed
the boys thusly: &quot;Lads, I&apos;m here to welcome you to heaven, where you
will spend eternity. Just remember one thing, when you go through these
gates, don&apos;t step on any of the ducks or you&apos;ll be punished for
eternity.&quot;
   Sean went in first and was amazed to see that the
entire
landscape was encompassed by ducks, and try as he might, sure enough he
stepped on one. He was immediately joined by one of the homeliest
colleens he&apos;s ever laid eyes on, and she said,&quot;Well, love, you stepped
on a duck and now we&apos;re together for all time.&quot;
   And of course the exact
same thing happened to Michael, only his companion was even the worse
for wear. By this time Tim was absolutely terrified. He gingerly
managed to make it most of the way across the court without stepping on
a single duck. Suddenly, his arm was taken by a young lass. Tim looked
over and beheld the most beautiful, graceful, blue-eyed woman he&apos;d ever
seen in all his life. He gasped, &quot;I don&apos;t understand it!&quot;
   The young
beauty answered, &quot;Well, I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t either. I was walking along
minding my own business, when all of a sudden I stepped on a duck.&quot;

smoking. It hasn&apos;t been easy, but we are so proud of you, Mark! 
...Tomorrow is Genius Day--- We
can ALL celebrate this one! Let&apos;s all call Sid Hartman. 
...Tomorrow is White Day--- Thought
I was going to have to wash sheets tomorrow, but this is a day of
celebration in Japan. Men send gifts to the ladies they love.
 ...Tomorrow is Pi Day
--- Pi ( π) is the mathematical mystery that affects our
daily lives. It is not to be confused with PIE DAY, a day which our
Faddassers like to celebrate with gusto whipped
cream. It is celebrated on March 14th, because that represents the
approximation for Pi: 3.14 
 
 Seriously...
 The winter blahs seem to have affected our eating
habits. I have talked to several of our Faddassers and they are all
having the same problem. It&apos;s been hard to stay motivated the winter.
The largest weight loss was last summer when we first started. Now that
we&apos;ve been at it nine months, we&apos;re coasting. Nine months...we could
have produced a baby in that time!

It&apos;s time to get moving. The weather has been nice so walking is once
again pleasant, and the markets are getting in fresh fruits and
vegetables from Chili and other places. Let&apos;s get with the program!
Walk! Make healthy food choices! Practice moderation!

 The Grapevine 
 No Fadd Gram yesterday because I seem to have a touch of what I
think is the flu.

The birds are so busy at our feeders. The snow birds are coming back
from the south. We had a mourning dove and a flicker at the feeder this
weekend and have lots of finches, juncos, cardinals, chickadees and
nuthatches. Haven&apos;t seen a robin yet, but I&apos;ve heard some have returned
to the area.

The Caps for the Troops continues to do well. Can&apos;t remember if I told
you that Faddasser Kay dropped 9 caps off at my doctor&apos;s office in St.
Cloud. I&apos;m just starting my 30th one. I need to quit for awhile and get
something else done, but it&apos;s a relaxing thing to do when you&apos;re
hurting.
 
 Tip for Today 
 One time to skimp on water... 
Drinking lots of water is a must for a healthy body. There is, however,
one time when you are encouraged to skimp on water. That&apos;s when you&apos;re
cooking vegetables. Lots of vitamins are water-soluble and the more
water you use, the more vitamins you lose. Why not try steaming them or
using them in a stir-fry. They&apos;re delicious and much more nutritious.

 I have a dream...
 &quot;Don&apos;t
be afraid of the space between your dreams and reality. If you can
dream it, you can make it so.&quot; -- Belva Davis 
 
We all have dreams of what we want and how we&apos;d like things to be. The
images of success and beauty flit across our mind&apos;s eye and it&apos;s up to
us to either file them away for future reference or to toss them to the
night winds. Dreams are the rest stops, the oases, along the road of
our life&apos;s journey. Pick a dream and make it a reality. Want to be
slim? Want to be healthy? Picture yourself that way; dream about it.
Then do it. Eat healthy, practice moderation, and exercise. &quot;Dream a
little dream of you&quot;...a healthy you; a slim you.

 I
started doing Pilates last year. I&apos;d stopped...but have started again
and my arthritis feels so much better. I use a beginners (hah! I&apos;m
scared to go to the intermediate level!!) DVD and have been doing it
every other day (every day seems too much for my joints, while every
other seems to take the pain away) for a few weeks now and am again
amazed by its effects. (Why do we quit doing something when we know it
makes us feel better and is good for us?) It&apos;s based on the idea of
&quot;core strength&quot; and it&apos;s supposed to be used with cardio exercise
added, as tolerated. I&apos;ve simply been dancing for the cardio (which I&apos;m
sure is a sight to behold). Anyway, I don&apos;t know if anyone else has
talked to you about Pilates and wanted to let you know how wonderful I
think they are. I have a big ball to balance on, but know I&apos;d just fall
off so haven&apos;t inflated it yet. --- Faddasser Jean 

Note: Pilates (pronounced &quot;puh-lah-teez&quot;) is a method of exercise
and physical movement designed to stretch, strengthen, and balance the
body. This web site explains it. http://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/whatis.html   Also, there are tons of books and videos available and scores of web
sites. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Emotional about food? 
When we get stressed and over-react or become crabby, we need to
practice what we preach to our children: Have a time-out. Your children
are sent to their rooms or the special &quot;time-out spot&quot; to think things
over and settle down. You need to do the same. Take your time-out by
taking a warm bath, go for a walk, listen to relaxing music or call a
friend just for a chat. By settling your emotions with a time-out, you
will divert your thoughts from food, the most common stress buster.

 A woman was sitting
at a bar
enjoying an after-work cocktail with her girlfriends when an
exceptionally tall, handsome young man entered. He was so striking that
the woman could not take her eyes away from him. 
 The young man noticed her
overly-attentive stare and walked directly
toward them. Before she could offer her apologies for being so rude for
staring, the young man said to her, &quot;I&apos;ll do anything, absolutely
anything, that you want me to do, for $100, on one condition.&quot; 

 Flabbergasted, the woman
asked what the condition was. 

 The young man replied,
&quot;You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words.&quot; 

 The woman considered his
proposition for a moment, took some money
from his purse, and gladly pressed it into the young man&apos;s hand. 

 She looked deeply into his
eyes and slowly and meaningfully said, &quot;Clean my house.&quot;

 I missed you...
 As you may have noticed, I didn&apos;t get the Fadd Grams
out this week. I couldn&apos;t figure out Sandy&apos;s e-mail and I hate to
monkey around on someone else&apos;s computer. We got back last night and
had a sick grandchild with us today, so this is the first chance I&apos;ve
had to talk with you. We came home via St. Cloud so I could work my
post op exam into our schedule. It saved us a lot of miles.

Hope you have all been remembering to eat healthy and practice
moderation. No plans for leaving town for awhile so I should be able to
keep the Fadd Grams coming.

 The Grapevine 
 Couple of things today.
We need prayers for Faddassers Dan and Jody. Dan, who had a kidney
transplant in January, is now scheduled for hernia surgery. When I got
home, I also had an e-mail from Faddasser Jody. She has breast cancer
and will be going in for surgery next week. Please pray for these two
friends and also for each other. We can all use some extra prayers.

Here&apos;s an e-mail that I received from one of our Faddassers. It made me
feel good. Thanks, Jen.
 
 Your plans
must have backfired. I am
really trying hard to hang in there, but I miss the your wonderful
words of

 ...Today is I Want You to Be Happy Day
...Today is Full Moon Day
...Today is National Anthem Day
...Tomorrow is Hug a GI Day 

 We&apos;re being eclipsed...
 According to the news, a full lunar eclipse will be
happening this afternoon between 2 and 5 PM CST. An
eclipse is the partial or complete obscuring of a celestial body. The
sun is so brilliant this afternoon that I don&apos;t know how we&apos;ll see it,
but the moon is supposed to turn a deep red as the shadow crosses it.

Our bodies may not be celestial, but they are often doing the
eclipsing. They eclipse our self assurance by focusing on our weight
and not our personalities. We get so intent on the shape of our bodies
that we forget about all the positive attributes that God has given us.

Eat healthy foods, practice moderation, drink lots of water and
exercise. By doing so, you&apos;ll soon be down to only a partial eclipse
and eventually that big shadow will disappear completely. Don&apos;t let
your spirit be obscured by your weight.

 The Grapevine 
 My nanny career continues tomorrow when we head for Eagan to take
care of the triplets. Lyle will be leaving Monday at noon to join their
parents in Vegas. I&apos;m looking forward to it because the grandkids don&apos;t
get up until 8 AM and school starts at 9. The school doors are about
3/4 of a block from their house so I can sit on the sofa and watch them
as they go to school and again when they come home. The crossing guards
are very conscientious about their duties and escort them almost to
their front door. I&apos;ll be on my own from 9 AM until 4 PM. Ah, sweet
solitude.

Tomorrow when you&apos;re at church, find the GIs in your congregation and
give them a hug. They&apos;ve sacrificed much for all of us and often go
unappreciated.

 I Want You to Be Happy Day goes without saying. Sometimes you
need just a pinch of sorrow so that you appreciate happiness when it
appears on the threshold. May you have a happy ending.

I have sent an e-mail template of the Fadd Gram to my daughter so I&apos;m
hoping I can get the Fadd Grams out every day this next week. If you
don&apos;t hear from me, my plans backfired.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Don&apos;t forget shrimp 
There are a lot of specials on seafood during Lent. You can get a large
bag of peeled, cooked shrimp for a reasonable price. Keep them in the
freezer and use them in salads and stir fries, or just thaw them
and
savor them, using moderation in the dip, of course.

 Cup of Friendship becomes a kitchen quandary 
 L ast year the 14-year-old son of a
friend had a baby. More accurately,
he had a 10-pound sack of rice, right off the grocery store shelf, that
he swaddled in a worn, blue blanket. He wasn’t supposed to let the
precious bundle out of his sight for a couple of weeks. 
 It was a school
project, a lesson in responsibility. And a lesson between the lines in
the perils of becoming a teen-age parent. 

 You think taking
care of a sack of rice is hard? Try a real baby. That&apos;s what the school
wanted to get across. Ha! Our public schools should wise up. Throw out
the rice babies. Give the kids some Amish Friendship Bread Starter!
Then the kids would learn responsibility. With a capital R. Real Fast!
I&apos;m three times the age of my friend’s son, and I still had some
learning to do. 

 Another friend
thrust a cup of the bread starter into my arms as I left his house the
other day. He shoved a piece of paper in my pocket. &quot;It&apos;s Day Six,&quot; was
all he said as he and his family waved goodbye. I could see them
smiling knowingly in the rear-view mirror. I was the recipient of a
bread-starter version of the chain letter. My &quot;baby&quot; was given to me in
an old plastic salsa container. 

 DAY SIX. The
instructions, listing Day One through Day 10, said that was the day I
was to add to the starter a cup of milk, a cup of sugar and a cup of
flour and to mix well. 

 Great. I got
home late. The milk in the refrigerator -- barely a cup left -- was at
the high end of its expiration date. I had just a cup of sugar. And,
well, less than a cup of flour. But I was darned if I was going to go
to the store when all I wanted to do was go to bed. I dumped in what I
had, mixed it up in a glass bowl and covered it with a dishtowel. That
would have to do. 

 I liked Day
Seven. It said to do nothing. All I had to do on Day Eight was stir
the stuff. On Day Nine I was to do nothing again. 

 The peace ended
on Day Ten though. I had to add more milk, sugar and flour. I had to
stir. Then I was to take out three one-cup measurements and give two
cups to two friends, saving a cup for myself. 

 To the rest, I
was to add a whole bunch of other stuff and bake some bread. Only
trouble was, I hadn&apos;t gone to the store, and I had been out of milk,
sugar and flour since Day Six. Day Ten came and went. So did Day
Eleven. 

 The actual
culmination of the Amish Friendship Bread into edible form -- two
beautiful, brown-topped loaves -- came on Day Twelve, with no bad
consequences. In fact, the stuff was pretty good. And good it should
have been. After all, it took five days longer to make than the whole
world did!

Have a good weekend and remember that God loves
you and

 Still coming down...
 The snow continues to fall, but is playing a game of
hide-and-seek with us. One minute it&apos;s a white-out and the next it&apos;s
just white out and not a flake in the air. We are protected from the
wind, but I hate not being able to see the storm. One of the nice
things about storms, if you&apos;re inside and cozy, is to curl up and watch
the snow swirl around outside. In our yard, it just falls...no
swirling, no dancing snowflakes. Pretty, but also pretty ho-hum.

I hope your weight is coming down almost as quickly as the snow. Losing
weight can be just as monotonous as watching it snow, but when it&apos;s all
over, we&apos;re into the spring season and our bodies are in our spring
shape. As Annie says, &quot;The sun will come out tomorrow...&quot; Be in
shape
to sport those summer clothes.

 Fadasser Roland left at 8:30 this morning to pick up the Buchanan
Family in the Twin Cities. They flew in from Washington, DC last night
and got the last available room at the Super 8. Just heard that they&apos;ve
arrived home safely so we can be thankful for that. It sounds like the
roads are pretty treacherous.

Most of the area churches had to cancel or postpone the World Day of
Prayer Services scheduled today. World Day of
Prayer, according to their website, is a
worldwide movement of Christian women of many traditions who come
together to observe
a common day of prayer each year, and who, in many countries, have a
continuing
relationship in prayer and service.Through World
Day of Prayer , women affirm
that prayer and action are inseparable and that both have immeasurable
influence in the world. It is celebrated the first
Friday in March of each year and all are welcome to participate. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Banana Cream Pie Day 
Banana cream pie is a good dessert and can be &quot;light&quot; it doesn&apos;t have a
crust. Prepare a box of instant banana pudding mix per the
directions,
using skim milk. Slice some bananas in the bottom of a dessert dish or
pie pan and pour the pudding on top. Put on a dollop of Lite Cool Whip
before serving and you&apos;ve got a Banana Cream Pie without the crust.
Tastes as good and you&apos;ve saved a lot of calories.

 Salesman Smile for Today 
 A customer at Morris&apos; Gourmet Grocery marveled
at the proprietor&apos;s quick wit and intelligence. &quot;Tell me, Green, what
makes you so smart?&quot; 
 &quot;I wouldn&apos;t share my
secret with just anyone,&quot; Morris replies, lowering his voice so the
other shoppers won&apos;t hear. &quot;But since you&apos;re a good and faithful
customer, I&apos;ll let you in on it. Fish heads. You eat enough of them,
you&apos;ll be positively brilliant.&quot; 

 &quot;You sell them here?&quot; the
customer asks.
 

 &quot;Only $4 apiece,&quot; says
Morris. 

 The customer buys three. A
week later, he&apos;s back in the store complaining that the fish heads were
disgusting and he isn&apos;t any smarter. 

 &quot;You didn&apos;t eat enough, &quot;
says Morris. The customer goes home with 20 more fish heads. Two weeks
later, he&apos;s back and this time he&apos;s really angry. 

 &quot;Hey, Morris,&quot; he says,
&quot;You&apos;re selling me fish heads for $4 apiece when I just found out I can
buy the whole fish for $2. You&apos;re ripping me off!&quot; 
 &quot;You see?&quot; says Morris. &quot;You&apos;re smarter
already.&quot;

 ...Today is Pig Day
...Today is Share a Smile Day
...Today is Peanut Butter Lover&apos;s Day
...Today is Plan a Solo Vacation Day

 Would you rather be a pig...
 Back in my youth, Bing Crosby sang a popular song with
these lyrics that he wrote: Would you like to swing on a star,
carry moonbeams home in a jar; be better off than you are or would you
rather be a pig? Hey, a pig is an animal with dirt on his face, his
shoes are a terrible disgrace. He ain&apos;t got no manners when he eats his
food. He&apos;s fat and lazy and extremely rude. But if you don&apos;t care a
feather or a fig...you may grow up to be a pig.

 I can&apos;t say that we go to these extremes, but some of us tend to be
piggy. We hog down the food and forget my favorite advice. And what is
that? SAVOR! Savor the food that you eat. Don&apos;t dive in and eat
everything as fast as you can. It&apos;s more than eating; it&apos;s dining .
Dining is where to eat slowly, have sweet converse with your fellow
diners, and savor the food. So...do you care a feather or a fig? Don&apos;t
grow up to be a pig.
 
 The Grapevine 
 Many of you probably don&apos;t know who Bing Crosby is, but if you&apos;re
reading this, you have online access. Google him. He was quite the guy.
Also, there are at least a hundred Christian books ( old Christian books) authored by Grace Livingston Hill. I&apos;ve read most of
them and always am in the process of re-reading one. Her characters
always have &quot;sweet converse.&quot; I just LOVE that phrase and it&apos;s not
often that you can work it into conversation, so humor me. If you
didn&apos;t read &quot;Would you rather be a pig...&quot; up above, then either go
back and read it or ignore this paragraph.

It&apos;s a beautiful white world outside and, thankfully, I&apos;m inside. The
news media have been telling us about it for so long that, you know,
I&apos;m almost missing Anna Nicole. Early dismissal yesterday, no school
today and probably no school tomorrow. I&apos;m thinking about coming out of
retirement. :-) 

One of our Faddassers found a bag tucked away in the back of a dresser
drawer and it had several bags of Hershey&apos;s Kisses in it. Now that&apos;s temptation! (Also, it could be the first signs of old age. How else
could you forget a chocolate stash?)

 A priest and a nun were lost in a
blizzard. After a while they came upon a small cabin. Being exhausted,
they prepared to go to sleep. There was a stack of blankets and a
sleeping bag on the floor, but only one bed. 
 Being a gentleman, the priest said,
&quot;Sister, you sleep on the bed. I&apos;ll sleep on the floor in the sleeping
bag.&quot; 

 Just as he got zipped up in the bag and
was beginning to fall asleep, the nun said &quot;Father, I&apos;m cold.&quot; 

 He unzipped the sleeping bag, got up,
got a blanket and put it on her. 

 Once again, he got into the sleeping
bag, zipped it up and started to drift off to sleep when the nun once
again said, &quot;Father, I&apos;m still very cold.&quot; 

 He unzipped the bag, got up again, put
another blanket on her and got into the sleeping bag once again. Just
as his eyes closed, she said, &quot;Father, I&apos;m sooooo cold.&quot; 

 This time, he remained there, giving
the woman a wink and a smile, then said, &quot;Sister, I have an idea. We&apos;re
out here in the wilderness where no one will ever know what happened.
Let&apos;s pretend we&apos;re married.&quot; 

 The nun said, &quot;Well, I am awfully cold so I guess it&apos;s alright.&quot;
 

 The priest rolled over, closed his
eyes, and said, &quot;Okay then, get up and get your own blasted blanket!&quot;

 Day 268
 ...Today is the last day of February
...Today my baby girl turned 40!

 I still have my baby fat...
 Can&apos;t believe it has been 40 years since I gave birth
to our daughter. In those days it seemed so exciting to gain weight
because it meant I was really pregnant and soon I would &quot;show.&quot; Well,
I&apos;ve been &quot;showing&quot; ever since and it&apos;s not exciting anymore. Since I&apos;d
never had a weight problem, I never dreamed I&apos;d still be carrying that
&quot;baby fat&quot; 40 years later. (Well, it&apos;s probably not the same fat. I&apos;ve
yo-yoed through the years, but never did get back down to my &quot;pre-birth
weight.&quot;)

I&apos;m not the only one who still looks pregnant... and it isn&apos;t only
women. I&apos;ve seen guys who look like labor is imminent. We need to get
rid of these bellies. They&apos;re not healthy, but it&apos;s not easy. Unlike
many of the ads you see, there is no way to pinpoint where you&apos;re going
to lose weight. The best answer? We need to pursue our goals: healthy
food, moderation, water and exercise.


 The Grapevine 
 Well, &quot;the big storm&quot; may or may not have started in Montevideo. We
had snow off and on since about 3 o&apos;clock. Our home is down in a little
&quot;bowl&quot; so it&apos;s hard to tell how hard the wind is blowing. Our schools
closed at 2:15 this afternoon. There&apos;s lots of anticipation among the
students and a good deal of trepidation among the parents. We&apos;ll see
what happens overnight. We&apos;ll have one child here whatever happens with
the weather. Mackenzie was sent home this morning with a sore throat
and a temp. The clinic verified that it was strep. Isn&apos;t it funny how
your throat aches after you hear that someone in your family has strep?
Don&apos;t know if it&apos;s my imagination or if it&apos;s the real thing. Grandpa is
a little nervous because he&apos;s leaving for Las Vegas for his birthday
trip on Monday.

Faddasser Kay is knitting caps for the troops in Iraq and told me about
other projects that are available for knitters who want to help those
less fortunate.  Guideposts has a special Knitting for
Kids
project. She participated in this project and so I looked it up. You
can&apos;t imagine how many sweaters they ship out! Go see for yourself: www.dailyguideposts.com/help/sweater.asp 
 
You can Google &quot;Knitting for Charity&quot; or go to this web site: http://www.knittingforcharity.org/ 

There are lots of places out there where you can help. After all, how
many afghans does a family need? Thanks to Kay for sharing, and thanks
to all of you who, in your own special way, help others.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Work in a work-out 
If you&apos;re snowed in tomorrow, you can still do some exercise. Put on
some music and dance. Jump rope. March while you&apos;re washing dishes or
on the phone. Be creative. Still haven&apos;t got time? Get up a half hour
earlier in the morning. You&apos;ll hardly notice the half hour and you&apos;ll
get your exercise out of the way for the day.

 It was snowing heavily and blowing to the point
that visibility was
almost zero when the Lena got off work. She made her way to
her car and wondered how she was going to make it home. She sat in her
car while it warmed up and thought about her situation. She finally
remembered Ole&apos;s advice that if she got caught in a blizzard she
should wait for a snow plow to come by and follow it. That way she
would not get stuck in a snow drift. This made her feel much better
and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and she started
to follow it. As she followed the snow plow, she was feeling very smug
as they continued and she was not having any problem with the blizzard
conditions. After quite some time had passed, she was somewhat
surprised
when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to her
car and signaled for her to roll down her window. The snow plow driver
wanted to know if she was all right as she had been following him for a
long time. She said that she was fine and told him of Ole&apos;s
advice to follow a snow plow when caught in a blizzard.

The driver replied that it was OK with him and she could continue
if she wanted to, but he was done with the Walmart parking lot and was
going over to K-Mart next.

 ...Today is Polar Bear Day
...This is Eating Disorder Awareness Week
...The Month of Love and Romance is drawing to a close. Better hurry!

 Polar Bears have extra fat for a reason...
 Yes. Polar Bears have extra layers of fat to keep them
warm in the cold, arctic weather. We have down comforters and warm
houses. We don&apos;t need that extra fat. We do need to exercise year
&apos;round...not necessarily a plunge in icy waters, but a good, brisk walk
outside...or inside, too...to get your blood flowing and strengthen
your heart.

Unless you&apos;re going to the far north to live in an igloo, you can
relieve your body of excess fat and not worry about it. What are you
waiting for?

 The Grapevine 
 The Marines have received their caps! Julie got a call from her son
today. Ironically, the second batch arrived first. Nothing has been
seen yet of the caps mailed a week earlier. Evidently &quot;neither rain nor
snow...&quot; works in Iraq. They&apos;re loving the caps so it&apos;s a good feeling
to know that our work is appreciated.

Sounds like we&apos;re in for more snow. The snow makes it seems like
winter...now that winter is almost over. With the bad weather on
Sunday, most area churches canceled their services. Without going to
church, it didn&apos;t seem like Sunday. We grow accustomed to our ways.

Faddasser Jeff just sent out an announcement that the Flat Earth
Belgian Pale Ale is now ready to taste. The tasting party will be
Thursday night at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul. This has been a dream of
Jeff&apos;s...to have his own brewery and he&apos;s had a lot more patience than
most of us would have had with all the little bumps along the way.
Congratulations, Jeff! Wish we could be there.
 
 Tip for Today 
 BORing...
 For many people, exercise can be boring. That&apos;s because they
haven&apos;t done enough of it. Once you get into an exercise routine, you
look forward to it. It can be alone time or fellowship time, depending
on your needs. The Mayo Clinic suggests that you rethink your
rituals. Your weekly Saturday matinee with the kids or with your best
friend could be reborn as your weekly Saturday bike ride, rock-climbing
lesson or trip to the pool. 

 Smile for Today: A Polar Bear Buffet 
 Q: What are polar bears called
when they get caught in the rain? 
 A: Drizzly bears. 
 
Q: How does a polar bear stop a VCR? 
 A: It just presses the &quot;paws&quot; button.
 
Q: What do polar bears like to eat
in the cold? 
 A: A &quot;brrr&quot;-&quot;grrr&quot;!
 
An Arctic explorer came face to face with a polar bear. Afraid of being
eaten, he fell to
his knees and started praying. When the polar bear knelt down beside
him and started praying, too, the man shouted, &quot;It&apos;s a miracle!&quot; The
polar bear opened one eye and said &quot;Don&apos;t talk while I&apos;m saying grace.&quot;

long.

 I&apos;m ba-a-a-ck...
 Got the bandages off and I&apos;m ready to go again. Went
to the therapy department at the local hospital instead of going to St.
Cloud. That saved a lot of driving on treacherous roads. It&apos;s amazing
how much the doctors can do with only three tiny incisions.

 Have several messages to share with you from
Faddassers. 
 From Faddasser D.K.
 God
bless you on the surgery. I appreciate your messages.  To pass on
if you like.... Another great movie is Facing the Giants . It
uses
football as an example, but relates to any trials we have in life and
gives us hope. If any one would like to see it, it can be checked out
at Salem church from the lib for
free!  As you know, I had the
gastric by pass, so I&apos;m down 70 pounds, but it has been
tough. I
admire and encourage people to lose weight the old fashion way, exercise and watch what you eat! 
 This was interesting
because I received it on Friday and the Evangelical Church in Watson
had a free movie that night and it was....you guessed it.... Facing
the Giants .

 ...Today is Teddy Bear Day
...Tomorrow is Banana Bread Day

 Yesterday, today and tomorrow...
 I hit a little speed bump in my life yesterday.
Actually, it started Friday when I went in for my pre-op and my blood
pressure was kind of high. I was told to monitor it over the weekend.
When I went in yesterday afternoon, it had gone over the top and they
sent me home to rest and do nothing and prescribed a strong blood
pressure medicine to take three times a day...besides my regular meds.
It was a depressing day for various reasons and the fact that after all
this waiting, there was a very good possibility that my surgery would
have to be delayed. As I was praying, I just prayed, &quot;Thy will be
done.&quot; When I went into the clinic this afternoon, my blood pressure
was 128/68. I leave at 8 tomorrow morning to get my knee fixed. Am not
sure when I will get the next Fadd Gram done, but you have lots of
archives to explore and revisit.

 AMAZING GRACE 
Tomorrow is the release of the new epic film, Amazing Grace .
David Buchanan sent me this e-mail:  http://www.amazinggracemovie.com/   I watched
this Trailer  on the telly last night so I
thought you
could put it in your thing somewhere. We should go out in force to see
this movie, the story of John Newton

 They&apos;re hitting the airwaves
pretty heavy with ads for this film and what I&apos;ve seen looks really
good. I&apos;ve seen smaller films about John Newton and the hymn, Amazing
Grace, and it is an unbelievable story. If you get a chance to see it,
don&apos;t pass it up.

Mark:
 Subject: Now the pressure is on! 
 Thanks for the words of encouragement. But as long as
we are talking about it, as far as Faddassers who
exercise and lost weight, I think I am about the
least. Fellow exercising Faddassers Steve, Al, and
Julie all have lost considerably more than I have.
Its nice to hear, though...thank you! And the no
smoking has been almost 5 months now! Woo hoo! You
may pass this on if you like! Thanks again! Smile for Today 
 Old man Johnson limped into the doctor&apos;s office and said, &quot;Doc, my knee
hurts so bad, I can hardly walk!&quot;

The doctor slowly eyed him from head to toe, paused, and then said,
&quot;Mr. Johnson, just how old are you?&quot;

&quot;98!&quot; Johnson announced proudly.

The doctor just sighed, and looked at him again. . .

Finally he said, &quot;Sir, I&apos;m sorry. I mean, just look at you. You&apos;re
practically one hundred years old, and you&apos;re complaining that your
knee hurts? Well, what did you expect?&quot;

The old man said, &quot;Well, my other knee is 98 years old too, and it

...Today is Love Your Pet Day
...This is Nostalgia Week

 Remember when...
 Remember when you could see your toes? Remember when
you didn&apos;t puff after climbing a flight of stairs? Remember when you
enjoyed looking in the mirror? Nostalgia can work for us as we
continue to lose weight. Plant a picture of a &quot;thin you&quot; in your mind
and then recall it and focus on it when you feel the urge to
overindulge.

Lent starts tomorrow and I really encourage you to use the next six
weeks as a challenge to lose 10 pounds. You can do it.

 Tip for Today 
 Love your pet... 
Pets, like humans, need exercise. Take your dog for a walk and it will
do both of you good. Got goldfish? Tape the bowl on a skateboard and
tow it. Got a cat? Forget about it. Cats don&apos;t do anything they don&apos;t
want to.

 Day 259
 ...Today is Presidents&apos; Day
...Today is Temporary Insanity Day
...Today is Solar System Day

 Crossing the Delaware...
 Two of the most well-known U.S. Presidents, at least
to school children, are George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. One of
the most recognized paintings in the world is the picture of Washington
crossing the Delaware. He was leading his troops into a surprise attack
on the English and Hessian troops on the other side of the river. This
became known as the Battle of Trenton.

In our daily battle for weight loss, each of us must make the decision
to cross the river of excess fat and enter the battle of the bulge.
There is no surprise attack involved, but once we make the decision to
lose weight, we have to follow our planned strategy and persevere.
Victory can be ours if we follow the plan: eat healthy foods, practice
moderation, drink lots of water and exercise. And a little advice from
old George himself: It is better to
offer no excuse than a bad one. 
 
 The Grapevine 
 Congratulations to Faddasser Mark who has not only been exercising
and working on weight loss, but he has gone for almost four months
without smoking! That&apos;s double jeopardy and he&apos;s winning the game. If
you have any words of encouragement for him, send them to me and I&apos;ll
pass them on. Great job, Mark!!!

Is it a coincidence that Temporary Insanity Day is celebrated on a
federal holiday when all the kids are home from school? It&apos;s something
to think about.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Because little George is associated with cherry trees...
 Cherry Almond Supreme 
 1
can (8 oz.) pitted dark sweet cherries in light syrup, undrained
1 package (4-serving size) Sugar-free Cherry Jello
3/4 cup boiling water
Ice cubes
2 tablespoons chopped toasted almonds
1 cup thawed Cool Whip Lite

Drain cherries, reserving syrup. If necessary, add enough water to
reserved syrup to measure 1/2 cup. Cut cherries into quarters.
Completely dissolve Jello in boiling water. Combine measured syrup and
enough ice to measure 1-1/4 cups. Add to Jello mixture. Stir until
slightly thickened. Remove any unmelted ice. Measure 1-1/4 cups Jello;
stir in half the cherries and half the nuts. Set aside.

Gently stir whipped topping into remaining Jello. Add remaining
cherries and nuts; spoon into 6 dessert glasses. Chill until set, but
not firm, about 15 minutes. Top with clear Jello mixture. Chill until
set...about an hour. 6 servings, 70 calories and 3 g. fat each.

 There was a boy who had to use an outhouse and
he hated it so bad.
One day it started to rain really hard and it got the bank all slippery
and wet so he decided to push it off. He did it and later that night
his father asked him if he pushed off the outhouse.

He said: &quot;Yes.&quot;

The father told his son to come with him to get his whipping.

The boy said: &quot;George Washington didn&apos;t get in trouble when he chopped
down the cherry tree because he was honest.&quot;

The boy&apos;s father said: &quot;But George Washington&apos;s father wasn&apos;t in the
cherry tree when he chopped it down.&quot;

 Day 258
 ...Today is the Chinese New Year
...Today is Thumb Appreciation Day
...Today is Pluto Day (Celebrating
the dog or the almost-planet?) 

 Two thumbs up...
 Today is Thumb Appreciation Day and I&apos;m all for it. If
you&apos;ve ever had an injury so you couldn&apos;t use your thumb, you&apos;ll know
how important a thumb is. You can&apos;t grasp hold of anything and it&apos;s
even hard to pull your trousers up. To be complete and to function
properly, a hand needs all five fingers. I&apos;m not saying you can&apos;t
function without your thumb...I&apos;ve seen it done. One of our friends can
out-bowl all of us and he no longer has a thumb. I&apos;m just saying that
things work better when everything is attached.

A healthy weight-loss program is like that. You can lose weight by just
cutting calories. You can also lose weight by exercising. The best
program, however, is a mixture of both. Give yourself two thumbs up and
do the whole program: choose healthy foods, practice moderation, drink
lots of water...and exercise!

 The Grapevine 
 Big strides in my eating habits. The grandkids were here Friday and
when the Schwan&apos;s man rang the doorbell, they yelled, &quot;Fudgesicles!&quot;
Being the good grandmother that I am, I bought a box...for the kids, of
course. (If you&apos;re a Faddasser newcomer, you don&apos;t know about my
addiction to Schwan&apos;s fudgesicles. Let me tell you, it&apos;s not a pretty
story.) Anyway, here it is two days later and most of the box is still
there. They don&apos;t seem to taste as good anymore. A big step for me.

Presidents&apos; Day has caused Lyle and I to split up. For nanny duties,
that is. He headed to the Twin Cities to take care of the Eagan kids
and I&apos;m on the home front with the young Hoidals. I&apos;m sure we never had
so many days off from school when I was young. Of course, we had &quot;mud
vacation&quot; in the spring, which no one has now. When the dirt back-roads
got muddy and full of mud holes, our country school was put on hold
until the roads dried up.
 
 Tip for Today 
 March to a different tune 
You can get some exercise in whenever you&apos;re standing around: waiting
for the toast, cooking something on the stove, or folding clothes. Turn
on some music and keep step to the beat. If your hands are idle, hunch
your shoulders up and down and back and forth. It will get the kinks
out. I have a tape of marching songs that I use. Try to stand still
while listening to a march. It&apos;s pretty hard to do. (Unless you have a
baton in your hand, I would recommend that you keep the marching
activities indoors..especially if you use a headset.)

 A minister was making a
wooden trellis to
support a climbing vine. As he was pounding away, he noticed that a
little boy was watching him. The youngster didn&apos;t say a word, so the
preacher kept on working, thinking the boy would leave.

However, the little boy didn&apos;t leave. Pleased at the thought that
his work was being admired, the pastor finally said, &quot;Well, son, trying
to pick up some pointers on gardening?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; the little boy replied. &quot;I&apos;m just waiting to hear what a preacher
says when he hits his thumb with a hammer.&quot;

 ...This is Mardi Gras Weekend
...This is Big Brothers and Big Sisters Week
...This is New Idea Week (To
celebrate Thomas Edison&apos;s birthday week) 

 A new idea...
 There are lots of creative people out there and
they&apos;ve all got creative ideas. When it comes to losing weight, we each
have our favorites: Eat off a smaller plate so the portions look
larger, drink a glass of water a half hour before eating, hang onto the
wall on each side of the scale when weighing, and
........................................ (fill in your own favorite.)

While they do help us on our food journey, they don&apos;t solve the
problems. You can come up with all kinds of creative eating ideas, but
it all boils down to one thing, and it isn&apos;t a new idea: You have
to just do it . You have to make good decisions. You have to
practice moderation. You need to get those limbs moving. It&apos;s your baby
(and I&apos;m not saying that because some of us look like we&apos;re pregnant),
but because you&apos;re the only one who can make you a thinner you.

Echo Company is 150 caps. Then we&apos;re going to start on another local
soldier&apos;s company. Her Mom is one of our knitters and she&apos;s stationed
in northern Iraq.

Only six weeks until Easter. It is a practical length of time to set a
weight goal. The angel rolled the heavy stone away from the door of the
tomb that morning long ago. How many pounds can you roll away by April
8th...Easter Sunday?
 
 Tip for Today 
 Walking poles (not to be confused with people from Poland who stroll) 
I&apos;ve never heard of walking poles before, but then I&apos;m old and don&apos;t
get out much. Just discovered them in a magazine. They&apos;re like a pair
of ski poles that you use as you do your aerobic walking. It gives your
upper body an extra workout, helps you keep your balance, and takes
pressure off your knees.

...Mardis Gras begins today
 
Lent begins Wednesday...
 Lent is quickly approaching and for some of us it is a
season of watching what we eat. I don&apos;t how much of this is done
anymore, but years ago that&apos;s what good Catholics did. They gave up
something for Lent. Since e very
roommate I ever had was Catholic ,
it was easier if I did it, too. It has become a tradition with me and
for almost 50 years I have been giving up sweets for Lent. I&apos;ve had to
make some decisions about the definition of &quot;sweets&quot; though. Does it
include &quot;sweet&quot; salads? &quot;Sweet&quot; rolls and pastries? Or just candy,
cake, and cookies.

It&apos;s a good practice and one you might want to try. It&apos;s only for six
weeks, but you know, by the time Easter morning comes around, the
chocolate marshmallow eggs aren&apos;t very tempting. Once the sugar is out
of your system, so is the temptation.

Did you know that cottage cheese has less calcium than other cheese?
The whey is drained off during processing and along with it, a good

fortified with calcium, so check the the label. Even without the
calcium, there is still protein and riboflavin.

 ...Today is Burger Lovers Day
...Today is Gumdrop Day
...Today is Jewelry Day

 Flip those burgers...
 Gotta love hamburgers. Here are some ways to cut down
the calories and still enjoy the flavor.
1. Grill them. Eat where they grill the hamburgers or, if you&apos;re
preparing them at home, grill them yourself. The George Foreman grills
work well in the winter season when most outside grills are put away
for the winter.
2. Whether at home or in a restaurant, use a paper napkin or
paper
towel to blot off the excess fat. (If you&apos;re in a restaurant with cloth
napkins, it&apos;s probably a good idea not to do this. However, if you&apos;re
in a restaurant with cloth napkins and you order a hamburger, just eat
it.)
3. Hold the mayo. When ordering, tell your waiter to hold the
mayonnaise. It just adds calories.
4. No cheese please. (Or bacon!) These additions can add tons of
calories to your burger.
5. Half a bun is better than one. Couple of options. Don&apos;t eat
the bun
at all, just the hamburger and veggie trimmings, or take the top off
and use a fork and knife to eat the hamburger and the bottom of the bun.
6. Forget the fries...or split them with several other people at
the
table. French fries are like peanuts...you can&apos;t eat just a few.
7. Don&apos;t supersize. If you do, it will also supersize your
thighs.
Gravitation, you know.

Making wise choices will get those pounds off eventually. And by losing
them slowly, there&apos;s a better chance they&apos;ll stay off. The turtle beat
the hare with a slow, but steady pace. Let&apos;s work on that.

 The Grapevine 
 Like the turtle above, slowly, but surely, the pounds are coming
off. I&apos;ve had reports of losses from half a pound to almost four pounds
for the last couple of weeks. Good job!

We&apos;ve had a lot of response to last week&apos;s Devotional: Waiting .
Not an easy thing to do...waiting. Many of us feel that way about
losing weight. It&apos;s kind of a &quot;weighting game.&quot;

Gumdrop Day. Do you know there&apos;s about 300 calories in 10 gummy worms?
They&apos;re almost pure sugar. Eating worms, gummy or otherwise, is not my
idea of food. It would be like eating licorice cockroaches. And
what
part of the food pyramid would they fall into?

 Tip for Today

 Love is in the air...
 And if it is, it&apos;s probably freezing! It was 16 below

violets are blue...&quot; was either written or spoken today?

How about your own heart ? Is it
happy and healthy? This is National Heart Month.
The best way to love your heart is
to love yourself first. If you love yourself, you will take care of
that heart . You will eat healthy
foods, you will practice moderation and you will exercise. I&apos;ve
repeated that statement so many times you should know it by heart now. If you haven&apos;t before, have
a change of heart now by putting
your heart and soul into keeping
your body healthy.

of Love Week, International Friendship Week, and American
Heart Month. Today is Final Warning Day. It&apos;s a reminder for men in
special relationships that tomorrow is Valentine&apos;s Day and their lives
would be a lot more enjoyable if they remembered that special person
with a Valentine.

It could also be a message from your body...a final warning that if you
don&apos;t shape up, your heart may go on strike. Something as important to
your life as your heart needs special treatment all year long...not
just on Valentine&apos;s Day. Your heart enjoys it when you eat healthy
foods and when you take it for a walk. Keep that relationship special
by practicing healthy eating, moderation and exercise. Your heart will
feel better and so will you.

asked what I was knitting. When I told her about the caps, she wanted
the pattern. (Can&apos;t remember if I told you this or not.) Anyway, Kay
wrote to ask for more information and to tell me that she has two caps
done and enough yarn for six more! We sent 52 caps out last Friday and
as of this afternoon there were 32 more in the basket. Another shipment
goes out this Friday.

Today is also I Value Our Friendship Day and I want you all to know

 President Abraham Lincoln is remembered for freeing

the shackles of extra weight? Free those pounds and proclaim yourself a
new person. You might even want to write your own Emancipation
Proclamation and set guidelines for your future freedom from fat. No
longer be a slave to your diet.

Once you get on track it becomes a habit and you&apos;ll hardly miss the
extra food. Enjoy your freedom in moderation, of course.

 Our church served coffee this morning at the Watson Community

anything. Instead I took off at 6:30 AM for Brookings, SD. I celebrated
yesterday today: I found a new friend. Barb belongs to the Brookings
Area Genealogical Society and we went to Arlington and then on to
DeSmet. The courthouse in DeSmet was built in 1898 and still has a
wooden-floored front porch. It was really neat. Did not find exactly
what I wanted...the name of my great-great grandfather...but I got some
other useful information so I can pursue my heritage.

Faddasser Eileen and I are going for our ten-pound goal. We report our
weight to each other and we&apos;re finally on a losing pattern.

Faddassers Mark, Julie and Al are really into fitness right now and are
working out at my son&apos;s gym, 1st Street Fitness. They&apos;re &quot;regulars&quot; and

 Get that heart pounding to lose pounds...
 We&apos;ve been talking about what it takes to gain or lose
a pound of body fat. Other than through liposuction or illness, weight
loss is something that you have to work on. You do this by watching
what you eat and by exercising. Remember that you had to burn 500 extra
calories a day to lose a pound in one week? Here are some ways.
 
 Run for half an hour. Climb stairs continually for 45 minutes. Do an hour of one of these activities: racquetball,
stationary rowing, swimming, tennis, or jogging. Mow the lawn (not on a riding mower) for 1 hour 15
minutes. Walk briskly for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Clean house for 2-1/2 hours. 
 Think
about that before you pop a little just-a-taste into your mouth. To
calculate calories burned on other activities, go to http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_burn.html .

 The Grapevine 
 Today is Make a New Friend Day. Have you done that? I made several
new friends down at the knit shop while working on the troop caps. Look
around. There&apos;s someone out there who is waiting to meet you. (I&apos;m
starting to sound like a dating service.)

My genealogy software arrived yesterday and I&apos;m anxious to get going on
that. I&apos;m on my 8th cap for the troops so it&apos;s a tossup as to which one
I should do. Since the ancestors have been where they are for years, I
think I&apos;ll concentrate on the caps. Although, if I could learn to type
with my toes, I could knit and search at the same time.

Scrap that. Not a pretty picture! :-( 

I&apos;m going to meet a nice lady in Brookings tomorrow (possibly a new
friend?) and she&apos;s going to help me find info in Arlington, SD about my
maternal great grandparents. Told my family I was going to the
Arlington Cemetery and they thought I was going to Washington, DC.
Nothing I do surprises them anymore. No, I&apos;m going to look for the
unknown in South Dakota.
 
 Tip for Today 
 If you exercise, DO drink 
Your body needs extra fluids as your burn off those calories. Have a
water bottle with you when you exercise and use it. Just because it&apos;s
cold outside doesn&apos;t mean your body doesn&apos;t sweat when working.

 Day 250
 ...Today is Umbrella Day
...This is Love and Laughter Week
...This is Snack Food Month (...or as we say, HEALTHY Snack Food Month)

 About that pound...
 Although sometimes we think a pound loss is
disappointing because it&apos;s &quot;only&quot; a pound, there&apos;s a lot more to it
than that. One pound of body fat is equal to 3,500 calories. So to lose
a pound, you have to reduce your normal intake by 3,500 calories. How
many calories a day? About 500. (Seven days x 500 calories is 3,500)

Supersizing going in makes supersize on the outside. Do you know that
adding a large order of fries and a large soft drink can add 650
calories to an already fat-laden burger order? Or that a piece of
apple pie is 450 calories? Watch those pats of butter, too. Each pat of
butter is 100 calories. If you&apos;re also putting on jelly or sandwich
meat, you won&apos;t miss the butter...or at least, not much.

Look for ways to cut back 500 calories a day and that pound could add
up to more than 50 by the end of 12 months.

Moderation.

 Ole was opening gifts at his graduation party. Many
of
the gifts were books, including a Bible. Ole didn&apos;t look very enthused
about the books, but then he opened a long, clumsy-looking package, and
there was an umbrella...a gift from his pastor.

&quot;Uffda,&quot; said Ole&apos;s father, &quot;that&apos;s a different graduation gift.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; replied the pastor, &quot;I thought of a book, too, but I wanted to
give him something that he&apos;d open.&quot;

 ...Today is Fri-i-i-i-i-i-day!
...Today is Weather Day
...Today is Pizza Pie Day
...Today is Toothache Day
...This is Valentine&apos;s Day Weekend

 Celebrate Pizza Day...
 Pizza has been given a bad rap. It&apos;s not a junk food;
actually, it&apos;s quite healthy...unless you load it up with junk. Prepare
it yourself so you know what the ingredients are. Make the crust thin
and don&apos;t use greasy meats like sausage or pepperoni. Or cut down on
the meat and add more vegetables and mushrooms. The sauce is basically
tomato and spices, so that&apos;s healthy. The cheese can make or break the
healthy aspect. Use low-fat cheese, remembering &quot;moderation&quot; when you
sprinkle it on. Moderation also becomes a factor when you&apos;re eating it,
too. Good choice: Sweet Swine, which is Canadian bacon and pineapple.

Best pizza to eatza...one with no meatza.

 Caps for the Troops update: We shipped out 50 stocking caps today to
marines in Echo Company in Iraq. Hope to have that many again next
Friday. They use them as helmet liners, even in the summertime, when
the natural fibers of wool soak up the perspiration.

We&apos;ve added some new addresses to the Faddasser Address Book. If
anything is going to get bigger, it&apos;s better for it to be the address
book and not us.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Healthy Pizza Crust
 Everyone can make their own pizzas at
home by using fat-free flour tortillas lightly
brushed with extra virgin olive oil. Or... spray the flour
tortillas with an olive-oil-flavored nonstick spray. Use tomato paste
for the sauce or combine the tomato paste with crushed tomatoes. Add
Italian seasoning and you have a very healthy pizza sauce.

 That joke was pretty bad. I&apos;d

A college pizza delivery boy delivered a pizza to Ole&apos;s trailer. After
getting the pizza, Ole asked: &quot;What is the usual tip?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; replied the youth, &quot;this is my first trip here, but the other
guys say if I get a quarter out of you, I&apos;ll be doing great.&quot;

&quot;Is that
so?&quot; snorted Ole. &quot;Well, just to show them how wrong they are, here&apos;s
five dollars.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied the youth, &quot;I&apos;ll put this in my school fund.&quot;

&quot;What are you studying in school?&quot; asked Ole.

The lad smiled and said: &quot;Applied psychology.&quot;

 Just a pound?
 Many people who are trying to lose weight are
disappointed when they weigh in and they&apos;ve only lost one pound. After
all, they&apos;ve been eating healthy food, practicing moderation, and
exercising. They expect a bigger weight loss.

A pound is a good loss. If you steadily lose a pound a week, you are
more apt to keep it off than if you have a big weight loss and then
plateau. Look at a pound of butter. That&apos;s how much fat has disappeared
from your body!

My doctor gave me some information on knee problems and osteoarthritis.
I was dumbfounded to see that for every pound you gain, you put
three extra pounds of pressure on your knees ! That is mind
boggling. If you&apos;re overweight 40 pounds...that&apos;s 120 pounds of extra
pressure on your knees! Since obesity is rampant in the United States,
it&apos;s no wonder the knees give out on so many people.

Just a pound? No...a pound!! That&apos;s three pounds of pressure off your
knees.

 I&apos;ve gotten hooked on knitting and am spending a lot of time down at

 ...Today is Send a Card to a Friend Day
...Today is Ballet Day
...Today is Run for Your Life Day
...Today is Sports Day

 Run for your life...
 This day is probably celebrated more widely in warmer
climates. Running in 20 below weather is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. In
fact, running itself may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea either. As an
aerobic exercise, it can strengthen your heart, burn off calories and,
perhaps, lengthen your life span. Running is a strenuous activity and
if it&apos;s not for you, try walking. Walking is a wonderful exercise that
not only makes you healthier, it relieves stress and can bring you
close enough to nature to &quot;smell the roses.&quot; If the cold weather is
making you stay inside, go to your local mall, or in Montevideo, go to
the TACC center. There, in the early morning, you can walk on rubber
mats as many times as you can make it around the perimeter of the room.

Whether it&apos;s walking, running, dancing, or aerobics...do something! Get
off that couch and get moving.

 One of our Faddassers has had a dream come true and he is finally

 This week&apos;s Montevideo American News has a front-page article about the caps we&apos;re knitting for the soldiers

 Tip for Today 
 Don&apos;t graze in too many pastures! 
If you find yourself grazing when it comes to snacks, watch your
portions. Those little bite-size snacks can add up to big-size
calories. They don&apos;t seem like much when you eat them, but if you don&apos;t
use moderation, it doesn&apos;t matter how low-cal they are. If you have 20
bites of 25 calories each (which doesn&apos;t seem like much per bite) you
would have 500 calories. That&apos;s in addition to your regular meals. You
don&apos;t have to count the calories, just the &quot;helpings.&quot;

 Two men were walking through the woods when a
large bear walked out into the clearing no more than 50 feet in front
of them. 
 The first man dropped his backpack and
dug out a pair of running shoes,
then began to furiously attempt to lace them up as the bear slowly
approached them. 

 The second man looked at the first,
confused, and said, &quot;What
are you doing? Running shoes aren&apos;t going to help, you can&apos;t outrun
that bear.&quot; 

 &quot;I don&apos;t need to,&quot; said the first man,

 Just say &quot;Thank you&quot;...
 Today is Pay a Compliment Day. Giving a
compliment is a lot easier for most of us than receiving one.
We seem to feel a need to explain why the compliment couldn&apos;t be true.
If someone says to you, &quot;What a nice jacket!&quot; you might reply, &quot;Oh,
this old thing? I&apos;ve had it for ten years.&quot; Or you&apos;re told, &quot;You look
like you&apos;re losing weight&quot; and you respond: &quot;I wish my scale said so!&quot;

Don&apos;t demean the compliment with explanations. Just say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;
It&apos;s that simple. If someone takes the time to compliment you, then you
deserve it. Really, you do.

 Diabetes Sunday...
 There are several of our Faddassers who are diabetic.
There are others of us who could develop the disease if we don&apos;t change
our ways. Their healthy eating habits set a good example for us. The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association follow
pretty much the same dietary program: healthy foods and moderation. One
of the causes of both diseases is obesity. So lose weight for your
health. Lose weight for yourself.

Uncle Dan&apos;s car was parked in front of the church and there he was,

 Keep the Bowl super, not the snacks 
Super
Bowl Sunday can be a real pitfall for healthy eating. Try to have
veggie snacks and low-cal snacks. And, as far-fetched as it may seem,
it is possible to watch a Super Bowl game without tons of food. We
Americans love to work food into all of our celebrations. Today should
also be call the Great American Pig-Out. I read in the paper today how
many tons of chips and dips Americans consume on this day. Football
players want to gain...yardage that is. We want to lose...pounds that
is. Watch them. Watch yourself. Enjoy the game.

What kind of a shadow do you cast? Are you working to diminish it? The

 Do you know why you are eating? 
Awareness is important in eating. We&apos;re already watching portions and
practicing moderation, but also be aware of why you&apos;re eating.
Are you using food as a crutch for something else or are you really
hungry? Emotional eating can really pack on the pounds. Finding another
outlet for your stress, like exercise, will benefit you two-fold. It
will burn up calories you have consumed and keep you from consuming
more.

 Tip for Today 
 Celebrating the Twist-Off Cap 
It&apos;s been 50 years since the twist-off bottle cap came on the scene. In
1956 it was a big innovation. Before that, you needed a &quot;church key&quot; to
open cans and bottles or a cork screw if a cork was used to stop up the
bottle. (If you don&apos;t know what a church key is, to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_key or  www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-chu2.htm .)
Today, you can get a bottle of water, take a swig, and screw the cap
back on until you&apos;re thirsty again. No spilling. It&apos;s especially nice
for carbonated beverages that need to stay &quot;confined&quot; to keep their
bubbles.

 Looking back on Backwards Day...
 We&apos;re
always told to look forward, but today would be a good day to look
&quot;backwards&quot; and see how our weight loss has progressed. By looking back
over what we&apos;ve accomplished, we can see our strong points and our
weaknesses. We often forget how hard we worked to get those pounds off
and how easy, in our weakness, it is to have those pounds return.
Pounds are social things; they like to have company and so bring other
pounds along with them when they come back. We need to pull the welcome
mat inside and lock
the door so that the Pound Family gets the idea that the party is over
and they and their pudgy friends are no longer welcome.

 Montevideo has a really neat yarn shop called Donna&apos;s Delights.
Donna raises sheep and spins the wool into yarn. (I&apos;ve spun a few yarns
in my day, but never anything involving wool.) Anyway, a local
mother
of
a soldier in Iraq brought in the idea for knitting stocking caps for
soldiers over there. My first question was, &quot;Isn&apos;t it too hot over
there for wool caps?&quot; Not at this time of the year, I was told. The
soldiers sleep in sleeping bags, but their heads are exposed and the
temps are in the 40s at night. So guess what? I&apos;m knitting my first
stocking cap. Very simple pattern. If you would like to knit a cap for
a soldier, let
me know and I&apos;ll send you the pattern. Donna is collecting the caps in
her shop and they&apos;ll be sent as soon as we have a lot of them.

Uncle Dan continues to do well and is expected to be back home in

are some ideas on how to celebrate from &quot;The Perpetual Preschool&quot;
website.

 On Backwards Day we: .
 
 Call each other by our last name
instead of our first
 Sit on our chairs backwards
 Lay under a table and draw on
paper that is taped under the table instead of it placed the top on the
table
 Go up the slide instead of going
down
 Ride the tricycles backwards
 Say &quot;Goodbye&quot; when we come to
school; say &quot;Hello&quot; when we leave
 Eat our dessert first at lunch Sing songs/describe things or
give instructions using &quot;opposites&quot;
 Count backwards

 FIVE STEPS TO A HEALTHY DIET 
 The Federal Drug Administration
is planning to issue a Guideline for Gourmets that advises you to:
1. List your ten favorite foods
2. List your five favorite beverages
3. List all green vegetables that look like marsh grass, fur
balls, or
little trees
4. List water
5. Avoid 1 and 2; eat only 3 and drink only 4

 ...Today is
Puzzle Day
...Today is Bubblegum Sculpture Day
...Today is Freethinker&apos;s Day
...Today is Kansas Day

 My mind is going...
 Yes, I think my mind is going, but it&apos;s going without
me and I have no idea in what direction! Still have not had an
inspiration for this week&apos;s devotional and I&apos;m really struggling with
the Fadd Gram tonight. So...I&apos;m going back to the beginning and start
over.

Evenings seem to be the most tempting time for most of us. We need to
get some hobbies. If you&apos;re busy, you don&apos;t have time to eat. Crafts,
knitting, crocheting, reading, games, doing dishes, straightening the
junk drawer, computer surfing...all of these things could keep your
mind off the hunger that isn&apos;t actually there. And...dare I say it? You
could even sit down and read the Bible or do some devotions.

Busy hands don&apos;t have time to stuff food in your mouth and busy minds
don&apos;t have time to think about food.

 The Grapevine 
 Am so anxious for Wednesday, when I see the orthopedic doctor in St.
Cloud. The not knowing what is wrong is almost as bad as the pain. (Ah!
And now I have a subject for my Devotional. Thank you, God!)

Tomorrow is weigh-in day. If you&apos;re working on that 10-pound goal, like
many of us, it can be an upper or a downer of a day. If it isn&apos;t
exactly what you expected, step off the scale, put on your positive
attitude and start over. You can do it!
 
 Tip for Today 
 You don&apos;t know the HALF of it! 
Hungry for a burger? Have one. Here&apos;s a couple of ways to make the
burger more healthy. Take the top of the bun and toss it. Take a napkin
and use it to soak up any fat on the burger. Then cut the burger, along
with the bottom of the bun, in half and put the two halves together.
It&apos;s like a double burger. It tastes just as good and you&apos;ve gotten rid
of a lot of excess fat and calories that you don&apos;t need.

 ...Today is Daisy
Day
...Today is Blueberry Pancake Day
...Today is International Make Your Point Day

 Make your point...
 There&apos;s a phrase around that a lot of people say: &quot;And
your point is?&quot; This is usually said after you&apos;ve made a long
explanation and is intended to be sarcastic. Well, a little sarcasm
goes a long way and certainly isn&apos;t a necessity.

Today, without being sarcastic, I&apos;d like to make a point: The object of
the Faddassers was to lose weight. Are you losing weight? Are you even
trying? It&apos;s not easy, but it can be done.

 Moderation : Half a loaf is better than one.
 Healthy food : Choose a food that is most healthy and habit will
make it the most agreeable.
 Exercise : A Faddasser, however
hard he (or she) tries, grows tubby without exercise .
 Water : Water, water everywhere. How many glasses
did you drink? 
 
 The Grapevine 
 The weekends go too quickly. I&apos;m still in a work mode and at noon on
Sunday, I&apos;m already wondering how many hours of &quot;freedom&quot; I have until
I have to go back to work. It&apos;s not easy, this retirement stuff. Old
habits are hard to break.

Evidently there aren&apos;t any poets out there. No one has answered my
challenge to journal their eating in poetic form. That was in
Thursday&apos;s Fadd Gram.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Rinse the fat off... 
One of my friends has to watch his diet because of heart problems. His
wife told me that when she browns hamburger, she blots it on paper
towels and then rinses it in hot water. The hamburger doesn&apos;t lose that
much flavor and it certainly has very little fat.

 Spice up your life...
 Just called a friend I hadn&apos;t seen nor spoken to for
almost 20 years. He&apos;s been on my mind so I looked him up on the web and
called him. Told him about the Faddassers and he said he had just heard
on TV (or the radio) about some doctors who are trying a tabasco sauce
diet. After they eat their favorite food, they mix tabasco sauce and
water together and drink it. The mind associates the hot taste with the
previous food and when you go to eat it again, your mind remembers the
ugly taste and sends out &quot;Don&apos;t eat it!&quot; signals. (I think it
was tabasco sauce...something hot, anyway.) I&apos;m going to do some
research on it. He said other doctors had tried it and felt that it
worked well.

 Today is our 45th wedding anniversary. Just goes to show what

 Tip for Today 
 Thank goodness for Ranch Dressing 
There are so many uses for Ranch Dressing mix. Adding it to bland
low-cal foods like yogurt and sour cream gives these dairy products a
little pep and makes a wonderful dip for vegetables. I made veggie
pizza today and it is a wonderful addition to the cream cheese topping.
Try it as seasoning in casseroles and on chicken.

...Today is Australia Day

 Get a mustache...
 If you don&apos;t have a milk mustache, then you need to
get one. Many of us don&apos;t drink enough milk to meet the minimum daily
requirements. Milk is a very healthy food and if you drink skim or 1%,
very low in fat. You need to strengthen your bones early in life and
keep on building on that strength. Try low-cal yogurt, cottage cheese,
and sour cream. And cheese. There are so many different kinds of cheese
that there&apos;s got to be one that you&apos;ll like. Get creative. Get milk.

 Couldn&apos;t

the order.

Lena came to the door, and Sven said, &quot;I found your note to leave 15
gallons of milk. Did you mean 15 gallons or 1.5 gallons?&quot;

Lena said, &quot;I want 15 gallons. I&apos;m going to fill my bathtub up with
milk and take a milk bath.&quot;

 We have quite a few Faddassers of Scottish descent who

down-to-earth poetry. Go to this site for interesting facts on Burns. http://www.robertburns.org/ 

Maybe we should be writing our journals in poetic form. It would take
longer and we&apos;d have less time to snack. Something to think about.

 I&apos;m back to work today. I must have had at least a hundred people

&gt;From my e-mail:
 I was
sorting laundry tonight and I had a huge
basket of whites/lights and a small basket of
darks. To save time and energy, I stuffed
all of my darks into my dark orange capris. They were stuffed from the waist down to the knees.   I had a feeling of relief as I accomplished my goal
and could now toss the darks right on top of the basket
and head down the stairway. One trip; not two. Alleluia.   Before I
ventured downstairs, however, I took the
jeans by the belt loops and held them up and
to see what these jeans actually looked like
when they were &quot;stuffed&quot;. Ah,
ha. Very interesting. Enlightening. 
 Tip
for Today 
 Orange you glad there&apos;s citrus fruit? 
With the freezing weather in California and the huge orange crop loss,
now is the time to buy oranges because they&apos;ll probably be very
expensive soon. They are such a refreshing fruit and very healthy. Not
only do they provide vitamin C, but they have lots of potassium, fiber
and folate...all contributors to a healthier body.

 ...Today is Compliment Day
...Today is Peanut Butter Day

 Compliments are nice...
 By sticking to your eating plan, you will soon be
receiving compliments. Get those 10 pounds off and your friends and
family will take notice. Compliments are the stroking we all need to
keep us going toward our goals. Think positive, eat healthy food
moderately, drink lots of water and exercise. That&apos;s the program.

There are all kinds of &quot;complimentary&quot; perks out there. Feeling the
urge for a snack? Think of it as a &quot;complimentary snack&quot; or a
&quot;complimentary drink&quot; and envision the way you&apos;ll look and the
compliments you&apos;ll receive if you don&apos;t eat &quot;complimentary&quot; foods.
That&apos;s the way to get compliments.

You can do it. Just say &quot;No.&quot;

 Quinn and I are doing some genealogy work and today, after a lot of

amazing how many names and birth dates he remembers about people he&apos;s
never heard of until now.

 Let the buffalo wings fly on by 
It seems like chicken wings would be a pretty healthy snack, right? Not
so. They&apos;re almost all fat and just a small amount of meat. Add the

 ...Healthy Weight Week
continues

 10 pounds...
 Been
thinking about the 10 pounds I&apos;ve pledged to lose. Looking at it from
this point of view, it seems like a lot, but SO much less than the
total amount I need to lose. That amount is overwhelming. As I said
before, losing weight is like starting on a journey. If you concentrate
on the first step, it&apos;s not intimidating. If you concentrate on the
complete journey, you get a feeling of hopelessness. It seems like more
than you can accomplish. How can you do all that?

How? By concentrating on your daily steps. When you&apos;re walking, if your
focus is on the horizon, you may stumble over something right in front
of you. You need to check the horizon occasionally to keep your
bearings, but you need to watch where you&apos;re stepping also. Practice on
the small steps and the rest will follow.

 The Grapevine 
 We&apos;ve added another Faddasser to our group. Welcome, Darla!

Our Fadd Family is getting larger while we&apos;re getting smaller.

 Set small goals 
Set a small goal...one that you can reach. Once you&apos;re there, set
another. If ten pounds is too much, set a goal of five. The amount
doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s just getting started. Do it now.

 ...Today is
Celebration of Life Day
...Today is Come in from the Cold Day
...This is Healthy Weight Week

 A day late; a dollar short...
 We didn&apos;t get home from the Cities until this
afternoon. Stayed an extra night. It was a fun time and, now that I&apos;m
retired, did not have to worry about reporting for duty. Lyle bought
another vehicle so we traveled separately, which was just as well,
since I&apos;d run out of clean clothes. Freshness isn&apos;t one of my strong
points today.

Life&apos;s journey has many detours and we run into them in every phase of
our lives. It&apos;s how we cope with these detours that make us or break
us. This is Healthy Weight Week. It would be nice to lose enough weight
to look great, but it&apos;s more important to lose weight for your health.
It has been medically proven that a loss of only 10 pounds can make an
amazing difference in your body. Look out for Number One...look out for
YOU...lose weight for your own well-being.

When I got home, there was a message from Fdsr. Eileen:
 I need to set goals for myself this
year. I need some incentive to help me lose this weight. I am
setting
a goal to reach by Mother&apos;s Day. I will record my weight the
first of
every week and see how I am doing and will send them to you also. I
have to get this weight off for health purposes, but I also want to do
this to look and feel better. 
 
AMEN! Set a goal of 10 pounds. Faddassers Sandy, Eileen and I are all
doing that. Won&apos;t you join us?


 The Grapevine 
 We are now the proud owners of a Mitsubishi &quot;Grand something&quot;...a
little SUV. That&apos;s why we had to stay over an extra night. Talk about a
small world. We went down to nanny because our daughter and her husband
were going to Duluth for a broomball tournament (which they won). Lyle
called on an ad for the Mitsubishi and guess what...it was about half a
mile from Sandy&apos;s house. The owners answered on their cell phone and
guess where they were. You&apos;re right again. They were in Duluth for
their son&apos;s hockey tournament. Anyway, the owners didn&apos;t get home
until 9 last night so we stayed on because we really need another car.
Lyl e&apos;s
already getting a lot of teasing because the model name sounds a lot
like &quot;grand Viagra.&quot; :-) 

I found a new career...knitting scarves for Webkins. If you&apos;re not
familiar with Webkins, they&apos;re soft stuffed animals sold at craft
stores. You get a &quot;registration&quot; number and when you go online to www.webkins.com ,
you can name your animal, choose a room for it, feed
it, and buy things for it. You earn &quot;money&quot; by playing games on the
site and using your winning points. I made 10 little scarves this
weekend. (My grandchildren are really deprived.)
 
 Tip for Today 
 Turn blue into happy 
Today is supposed to be the &quot;bluest&quot; Monday of the year. Someone did a
mathematical equation and said January 22nd was the day. Contributing
factors were cold, winter weather; Christmas bills coming due; and New
Year&apos;s resolutions having been broken. Don&apos;t let &quot;blue&quot; turn you into a

producing hormones that make us happy. Listen to some cheerful music.

 Eat a meal...
 I&apos;m finding out that I need to sit down and eat a
meal...not just a handful of something...even if I&apos;m not particularly
hungry. If I don&apos;t do that, I end up snacking until the next meal time.
I&apos;m out of Lean Cuisine dinners because the store was out of my
favorite &quot;flavors.&quot; That supply needs to be replenished. When I come
home for lunch, I just put it in the microwave and then sit down and
eat it. When I do that, I never seem to be as hungry as I am when I&apos;m
&quot;not hungry.&quot; Being &quot;not hungry&quot; and putting off the meal really
stimulates my appetite.

It all goes back to being prepared. Have the right food on hand and
you&apos;ll eat the right food.


 The Grapevine 
 Can&apos;t believe how my walking is improving. I doubled yesterday&apos;s lap
total and walked 8 laps today. Only had to sit down a couple of times.
While I sat, Deanna made another lap and then when she came around
again, we resumed where I&apos;d left off...on the back stretch. It&apos;s been a
hurtful experience, but I hope it&apos;s also a helpful one.

There are a couple of Faddassers who go to my son&apos;s gym and get the
tread mills and ellipticals smokin&apos;. That is so good. The exercise will
eventually make you feel better and you&apos;ll get stronger and stronger.

We have a dental situation in our family. Mackenzie (my granddaughter)
is struggling with her first loose tooth. It is just hanging there and
the new tooth is already completely grown in behind it. Like everything
else, she wants to &quot;do it myself&quot; so we made a dental office on the
couch, complete with dental assistant (me), dentist with pliers
(Quinn), and tons of Kleenex in case of blood. Lyle sat in the &quot;waiting
room&quot; and read. It was quite an ordeal. The TV had to be turned
completely off because it was &quot;nervousing&quot; her. Sure don&apos;t want any
nervousing! As of this morning, it was still dangling, like a charm on
a bracelet. It&apos;s such a dinky little thing that it&apos;s hard to get a good
grip on it. We&apos;ll keep you posted.
 
 Tip for Today 
 No sour cream? 
I don&apos;t know if I told you this before or not, but when I have a baked
potato, I put cottage cheese on it instead of sour cream. It melts down
and tastes good. If you&apos;re eating out, cottage cheese is usually a
salad choice. It works for me. Might work for you.

 Ben Franklin was probably one of the wittiest and most
intelligent men of my * his time. We all grew
up on &quot;Early to bed, early to rise..&quot; While I was doing a little

for making excuses is seldom good for anything else.&quot;

Maybe it&apos;s time to quit making excuses and get on with this moderation
program.

 The Grapevine 
 I&apos;m not ready for a marathon, but I walked one more (painful) lap
today than I did yesterday. Hopefully, the exercise will strengthen the
muscles that are hidden amongst the fat on my chubby little knees. I
thought my knees were just clicking in and out when I bent them, but
when I listened closer, I thought I heard, &quot;Help! We&apos;re surrounded and
we want to get out!&quot; Could have been my muscles instead. Fat is a tough
jailer sometimes.

Not everyone is making excuses. I heard from another Faddasser
yesterday.
 I
really enjoy reading the fad grams, Christmas was hard on me. I gained
a few pounds. My pants were getting tight on me so I decided to
start
working out again and watch what I eat. Today has been 2 weeks
since I
started and I lost 8 pounds. I am so happy. I have been working
on the
elliptical every day for 30 min. It almost kills me, but I do it and
when
I am done I feel good. 
 As well you should ! Eight pounds is wonderful...and all that
exercise! GOOD JOB!!! Here&apos;s a gold star.  

Note: Ben Franklin is from a different era than mine, but he DID make a
kite for me when I was a little girl.

 Did you weigh today?
 Tuesday is our weigh day. I have kept my scale on
kilograms because I like the smaller figure. Doesn&apos;t really matter if I
weigh kilos or pounds...the lumps are still in the same places either
way.

Did you drink 8 glasses of water today? That is such a simple thing to
do. Pretend your water bottle is your cell phone and then you&apos;ll always
have it with you. (Don&apos;t forget and pour it in your ear by mistake
though.)

 Are you journaling your journey? I
have read a lot of articles about weight loss and a large percentage of
the people who have been successful say they have kept a journal.

These are all things that take very little time and no money; things
that can give you strong support,

 Started my exercise program today. Took those first small steps. My
friend Deanna doesn&apos;t want to get her car out of the garage on cold
mornings. My car is warmed up from taking the grandkids to school so I
just swing by and pick her up. A perfect match. We went to the TACC
center and made a few laps. She did four; I did three. I had to rest my
knees after 1 1/2 laps. We got passed a lot by faster walkers, but we
feel that whatever we do is an accomplishment. After all, the turtle
won the race with perseverance.

Now think about &quot;how many hats you wear&quot;...meaning different jobs you
do. We need to put on our healthy hats and wear them proudly. For many
of us, temptation is only a &quot;drop of the hat&quot; away. So &quot;toss your hat&quot;
into the moderation ring and eat right. Believe it or not, there&apos;s more
to life than just eating. And I&apos;m not &quot;talking through my hat!&quot;

&quot;Hat&quot; enough? I&apos;ll quit now, but remember to put your healthy hat on
often.

reassuring to know others are going to through the same struggles and I

 An elderly man was quite unhappy because he had lost his
favorite hat. 
 Instead of buying a new one, he decided he would go to church and swipe one out of the vestibule.

When he got there, an usher intercepted him at the door and took him to a pew where he had to sit and listen to the entire sermon on &quot;The Ten
Commandments.&quot;

After church, the man met the preacher in the vestibule doorway, shook his had vigorously, and told him &quot;I want to thank you, preacher, for saving my
soul today. I came to church to steal a hat and, after hearing your sermon on the 10 Commandments, I decided against it.&quot;

Preacher: &quot;You mean the commandment &apos;Thou shall not steal&apos; changed your mind?&quot;

Old Man: &quot;No, the one about adultery did. As soon as you said that I remembered where I left my old hat!&quot;

 Become a drinker...
 Our bodies require 6-8 glasses of water a day to
function. Most of us do not even come close to consuming that amount.
Many people think that coffee and soda count toward that goal, but they
don&apos;t. You need water...simple, as-close-as-your-faucet water. If you
don&apos;t get enough water, your body starts to dehydrate. We often think
of dehydration as a symptom of high fever and sickness. It is, but it&apos;s
also a very common every-day problem. It happens daily and most people
don&apos;t realize they have it. Dehydration can cause symptoms such as
headaches, tiredness and loss of concentration. If you keep yourself
dehydrated on a regular basis, you could end up with major health
problems.
 
 Start the day with a drink. Have a glass of water as
soon as you wake up. If at all possible, keep a container of water near you
during the day. It can be a container of fresh water in your
refrigerator or, if you&apos;re away from home, bottled water. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. They contain
a lot of water. 
 Besides
being a healthy habit, it gives you a feeling of fullness that will
fend off hunger pangs. Drink a glass about a half hour before your
meals and you will not eat as much.

Water is important to your health. It&apos;s not an expensive habit; it&apos;s
not a hard-to-do habit.

 Drink water.

 Here are the results that I received when I asked how the year had
gone.
 After a &quot;break&quot; from LA Weight Loss, two weeks of holiday parties and, unfortunately, two funerals in one week (long story ) I went back to LA Weight Loss, went back on program. So, starting at 177.8 lbs in April, I&apos;m down 42.6 lbs! My goal is to get under 130...another 6.2lbs to go! 

 I look so forward to the fadd grams. This fall things haven&apos;t been going off as fast, but I haven&apos;t been exercising as much and as vigorous as I do in the summer so no one to blame but myself. I have kept off 27 lbs that I had in June but I don&apos;t have now, so that is progress. If I can maintain over the holidays and then hit it hard in the new year... The fadd grams make me more aware of what I&apos;m doing and give me good tips. Thanks for all your encouragement !
 
 Because of the Fadd Gram 
 Or 
 Maybe its a Queen like Jean 
 I have lost 15 pounds

and kept them off. I always look at the

can drop 10 more pound by our first anniversary (faddasser anniversary) 
 Tip for Today 
 Since this is Oatmeal Month, I want to share this recipe for Crock
Pot Oatmeal. There were 25 reviews on it and they all said it was
excellent. How nice on these cold winter days to get up in the morning
to a bowl of hot oatmeal. Leftovers can be warmed up in the microwave.
Just stir in a little milk before you microwave. 

 CROCK POT OATMEAL 
2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal
6 cups of water

Spray the inside of the crock pot with non-stick cooking spray. Add the
oatmeal and water and stir. Set the crock pot on LOW and let it cook
for 8-10 hours. In the morning you&apos;ll have hot, creamy oatmeal. You can
add raisins, cranberries, cinnamon, apples...whatever you like...before
you cook the oatmeal. Stir before serving.4 servings.

...Today is the Oatmeal Festival in Lafayette, Colorado ( For more information, go to http://www.discoverlafayette.com/oatmeal.nsf/html/Press+Release ) 

 Oatmeal Month... 
This is Oatmeal Month and Lafayette, Colorado, is celebrating today.
Not only is oatmeal good for your health (it can lower your
cholesterol), but it&apos;s also a wonderful treatment for your skin. I
encourage you to go to the Lafayette website and read about it. One of
our Faddassers has been eating oatmeal daily since we started in June.
I&apos;m not sure if his cholesterol is lower, but he feels better. I love
oatmeal, but always think it&apos;s too much fuss to make. Actually, it
isn&apos;t. The microwave kind is tasty and can be prepared quickly. Even
the old-fashioned oatmeal can be prepared in just a short time on the
stove top. Add oatmeal to your diet, both for your heart and your
hearty appetite. It fills you up and &quot;sticks to your ribs.&quot; Isn&apos;t that
an interesting saying? Sticks to your ribs? It means that you have a
feeling you&apos;ve eaten a lot; a full feeling. I very seldom eat anything
without spilling on my bosom area. When you have a glob of oatmeal
stuck to your front, it&apos;s literally &quot;stuck to your ribs.&quot;

The cold weather that is upon us is a good reason to eat hot oatmeal.
Besides milk or cream, there are many popular toppings. Most people use
sugar. Some use brown sugar. The Quaker Oatmeal has many other
suggestions. Here are a few. For the rest, visit their website http://www.quakeroatmeal.com/qo_quakerKitchen/toppers/index.cfm .
 
 Raisins and brown sugar Low-fat granola and skim milk Currants and golden raisins Raspberry nonfat yogurt and dried

yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon Maple flavored pancake syrup and a
sprinkle of sunflower seeds Canned crushed pineapple, sliced

Roller Skating Day
...Today is Make Your Mark Day

 Make your mark...
 An interesting idea came to mind when I read today&apos;s
calendar of events.

Make your mark. Many of us have marks on our woodwork or walls to show
the growth of our children. Every birthday you make a mark to show how
much they&apos;ve grown. What if we pretended it was Opposite Day and stood
in the corner against the wall and made a mark where our hip ended.
Then as we lose weight, we could see how much narrower we&apos;re becoming
(narrow in body, not in mind.) If you don&apos;t want to mark up your wall,
put a piece of painters&apos; tape on the wall and mark that. It might work
out even better to see that broad blue mark. It&apos;s worth a try.
Sometimes it takes a gimmick to make us see the truth.

 Good old Faddasser Bob. He&apos;s always there to give me a boost. This
is what I received this morning.
 I hate to
pop your bubble, but maybe the scale is set on k and not lbs. There
should be a switch on the back for either. If it is k, then we all know
how much you weigh. Maybe that is your accountability or maybe not. Just
trying to be helpful.

 By golly, there IS a switch on the back . 
 
 Granddaughter Mackenzie weighed last night and the
scale
showed only 10.1. She was in tears because she wants to be a big girl
and she KNOWS she weighs 40.5. 

Ah, to be upset because the scale didn&apos;t weigh enough.

 Roller Skate your way to fitness 
Today is dedicated to roller skating. If your body is still up to it,
it&apos;s a great way to get some exercise. Take your family skating. When I
was young we used to take a bus from Hanley Falls to Granite Falls on
Sunday afternoons so we could skate for an hour in the outdoor rink. It
had a big tent roof on it and I think we got clamp-on skates. We
thought we were pretty cool. The return bus left before skating was
over so we had to leave early, but we loved skating.It&apos;s good family
fun.

 Ole and Lena owned a small farm in Canada,
just yards
away from the North Dakota border. Their land had been the

One day her son came into her room holding a letter. &quot;I just

 Breaking habits...
 Habits, whether they&apos;re good or bad, are hard to
break. Your body likes routine. In fact, your brain produces a chemical
called dopamine that works to control reinforced behavior...or habits,
as we say. In order to make or break a habit, you have to be constant
in your efforts. In our first weeks as Faddassers, we set 21 days as
our goal to moderation and healthier eating. I read that if you do
something every day for 21 days in succession, it will become a habit.
The problem is staying &quot;constant&quot; for that long. Pick out one thing
that will improve your health and practice it for 21 days straight.
After that, each day will be much easier as your habit forms. So take
advantage of your body and use your brain to help you lose weight.

 The Grapevine 
 Forgot to tell you that, although I didn&apos;t lose any weight last
week, I stayed the same: 103. Once during the week I was up to 104.4 so
I know the numbers change. I know what my weight was when the scale
dropped to 103. I&apos;m going to leave it for awhile. After I start losing,
I&apos;ll put the new battery in because if I drop below a hundred, I&apos;ll be
anorexic. For now, it&apos;s rather nice to weigh 103.

 Seven Principles of Success 
 
1. It is okay to fail (We just start over the next day)
2.  Don&apos;t be afraid to start.  (That is harder than
it seems.)
3. Dare to dream big (or in our cases, smaller)
4. Don&apos;t be afraid to try something new
5. Take things one step at a time
6. Keep moving forward
7. The only thing that can stop you is you!

 ...Today is Make Those Dreams Come True
Day

 You can make them come true...
 If they&apos;re realistic dreams, there&apos;s a very good
chance you can make them come true. If they&apos;re unrealistic, they still
might happen, but it will take big-time effort. For most Faddassers,
the dream is a slim and healthy body. We dream of ourselves in skinny
jeans; we dream of ourselves in sleeveless blouses with no crepe capes
hanging close to our armpits; we dream of looking down and seeing our
feet, without leaning forward. It&apos;s sounds so simple: eat less,
exercise more. It may sound simple, but it&apos;s very difficult. It is,
however, a realistic goal and one that you can do. Start now. Use
moderation, exercise and healthy eating. Those three things can help
you make that dream body come true.

 I&apos;m beginning to believe that God really wants me to lose weight.
Monday night Lyle was gone so I didn&apos;t bother to fix supper. I just
snacked my way through the evening because I &quot;wasn&apos;t really hungry.&quot; By
bedtime I was craving something sweet and, since the cupboards were
pretty much empty of &quot;sweets,&quot; I ended up with a small Dixie cup half
full of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I was going to nibble them in
bed
while I finished my book. As I passed the bathroom, I thought I&apos;d
better make a pit stop there...kill two birds with one stone, so to
speak. As I went to set the cup on the vanity, I tripped on the rug and
the chocolate chips went up in the air and floated down into every
crack and cranny of our small bathroom. It looked like a rather large mouse had been
running rampant. I picked up what I could, which was no small feat,
given the condition of my knees. If I missed any, my cleaning lady is
going to really wonder what&apos;s going on when she comes to clean next
Tuesday. Saved by the fall. My cup didth no longer runneth over and I
didn&apos;t have any more chocolate chips.

 The long and short of it... 
 From Faddasser Kyle: &quot; I was watching Good Eats with Alton Brown one day and he was expounding on all the wonderful properties
of the shorter grains of rice that are more commonly used in other areas of the world.
America is unique in it&apos;s devotion to long-grain white rice which, though still quite healthy, is
the Wonder Bread of the rice world when compared to its shorter , sometimes darker, cousins.&quot;

He&apos;s going to see if he has the episode on DVD and I&apos;ll see what I can
learn. Thanks for the input, Kyle.

 Get a buddy..
 Since we don&apos;t hold meetings, we each need to get a
buddy. By buddy, I mean a friend; someone who is also trying to lose
weight. You can work together for each other&apos;s health. I have a
granddog named Buddy, but he&apos;ll eat anything in sight so I don&apos;t think
he&apos;d be a good influence. However, today I was talking with my
traveling friend and she said that she wants to lose 10 pounds by the
time we leave on our trip in May * . We decided we needed some
accountability; we needed someone to report to so that we couldn&apos;t just
sit back and say, &quot;Tomorrow. I&apos;m going to really get going
tomorrow.&quot; Like all the refrigerator magnets read, &quot;Today is the tomorrow you
talked about yesterday.&quot; We&apos;re
going to be accountable to each other. Find
someone or &quot;someones&quot; to be your buddy/buddies. Then you, too, will
have someone to report to; to talk things over with; to get that little
boost that you need at the end of the day.

 *I mentioned above about losing weight &quot;before our trip.&quot; We are
leaving May 11th for Dublin and will journey south through Ireland,
ending up at Waterford. Our bus will then go by ferry across the Irish
Channel to Wales. Then we wind our way through Wales up to Cardiff,
where we&apos;ll have some free time. Before we&apos;re done, we&apos;ll have visited
Bath, Stonehenge and London. A little more ambitious than our original
plans, but we&apos;re very excited about it. Even a small weight loss would
make our trip a lot easier.

 Rice is nice... 
Did you know that the world grows more than 40,000 types of rice and
about 1.3 trillion pounds a year ? Try rice instead of potatoes.
Add it to salads. Make Minute Rice, substituting tomato juice for the
water. There are all kinds of recipes out there. Google &quot;healthy rice

 Schedule the time...
 We all have busy schedules and we&apos;re all struggling to
work in time for exercise. Somewhere in your busy day there is time .
You just have to find it. Start by writing down your daily schedule,
including the time you start each step and how long it takes. You&apos;ll
have to guesstimate on some of it, but you&apos;ll have something concrete
to look at. Now go over your schedule and see if there&apos;s a niche where
you can work in some exercise. You may have to do some juggling or
revise your standards a bit, but you should find a place for some kind
of exercise. Keep in mind that you are number one and you are
important. You need to make time for YOU...even if it&apos;s only 15
minutes. Do that for 5 days and you&apos;ve got yourself an hour and 15
minutes of exercise. Include the weekend and you have almost two hours! Keep this up for a year and it comes to 81 hours! That&apos;s
quite a start. Once you get into a routine, your body will urge you to
stretch your mind and the time.

 ...Today is Fruitcake Toss Day (Finally!) 

 Get rid of it...
 Yesterday was a day of decision for me. I started
cleaning my &quot;nest&quot;...the area that encircles my computer. I have two
bookcases, a two-drawer file, two computer desks, and a table...all
things that originally had top areas that I could stack and pile papers
on. When I got to the point that there wasn&apos;t a square inch of open
space, I was forced to dig in. The job involved a lot of decisions:
what to keep and what to toss. I have two bags of shredding and two
junk bags so I think I did quite well, since I am the result of
generations of pack rats. I find it very tough to toss anything out,
but there comes a time when we have no other choice.

Now is the time for the Faddassers. We need to look at our habits and
toss those that aren&apos;t doing us any good. We need to sort through our
cupboards and toss or give away the foods that will lead us astray. We
tell our children not to hang around people who could be a bad
influence. We need to quit hanging around food that is not good for us,
even though it tastes good. We need to do some major reorganizing. If
it&apos;s not there, you can&apos;t eat it. If you crave a food so badly that
you&apos;ll go out in the winter cold to get it, then eat it...but do so in
moderation.

To keep or to toss? That&apos;s the question. What is your answer?

 The Grapevine 
 Faddasser Eileen, after reading about my scale and my weight of 103
pounds, asked, &quot;Can I use your scale?&quot; Unfortunately, my bubble was
popped by Faddasser Gail, who said, &quot;Oh, you just need a new battery.&quot;
It&apos;s amazing that a tiny little battery can make a hundred pounds
difference!

We talked with Uncle Dan at our potluck dinner after church today. He
sounded in good spirits, as well he should. Sounds like he&apos;ll be moving

VanderLaan film. Mark had an epiphany that affected him.

Perhaps it&apos;s time that, as Faddassers, we all have an epiphany on the
meaning of &quot;moderation and healthy eating.&quot; I think we&apos;ve strayed from
the fold a bit (&quot;Speak for yourself, John,&quot; said Priscilla.) Yes, the
queen has strayed. Sometimes it&apos;s a royal pain to try and keep on

 Turn up the heat...
 How to turn up the heat? Some people crank up their

 Bob went down to visit Uncle Dan today and he&apos;s getting better each
day. He&apos;s been off dialysis for two days.

After a full day of work, I remembered why I retired. Tired was the key
word. Even though it was the only day I worked this week, it was very
TGIF. Probably from losing so much weight. I got on the scale three
times this morning and each time it read 103 pounds. That is one HUGE
weight loss in three days!
 
 Tip for Today 
 Just a short walk will get you started... 
Did you know that with a 5-minute walk you will get in about 400 steps?
Only five minutes! Do that several times a day and you&apos;re on your way.
Take the long way to the supermarket. Park close so you don&apos;t have to
go so far with your groceries, but take the long way to the store. It
will help shake the cobwebs from your mind and you can think about a
grocery list so you&apos;re prepared

 What down?
 The game continues. Are you still on first down or
does the other team have the ball? Rather than throw the whole game
plan into the first down, it would be best if you concentrate on one
play. Whether it&apos;s eating the five fruits and vegetables, exercising or
journaling, it&apos;s too overwhelming to try and do everything at once.
Start out with one &quot;play&quot; and use it until you get your first down.
Should work. After all, the Vikings used it for years. Once you&apos;ve
mastered one play, go on to another.

If your game plan doesn&apos;t work, then you need to go back to the locker
room and focus on another play. Fortunately, our game doesn&apos;t have a
time element so we can keep plugging along.

 Surprise! I&apos;m going back to the Credit Union to help out tomorrow.
Just found out how much my trip in May is going to cost and it&apos;s

Uncle Dan is progressing slowly, but steadily. These things take time,

 A &quot;regular&quot; deal... 
Keep lots of fiber in your diet. Not only does it help the digestion

 ...Today is Full Moon Day
...Today is Start Your New Year&apos;s Resolution Day
...Today is the Festival of Sleep Day (A day to catch up on your sleep by grabbing a
few extra zzzzs.)
 
 We&apos;re going for the first down...
 Yesterday, after I had written the Tip for Today and used the analogy &quot;Forget the hail Mary and go for the short pass,&quot;
I started thinking about how our weight loss is a lot like
football. Instead of trying to do everything at once, we need to
concentrate on a first down. That&apos;s our main goal right now. In the
background, we&apos;re thinking about a touchdown, but we need to keep
grinding away and get that ball down the field. The same way with our
Faddasser program: we need to take it one step (or down) at a time and
keep working toward our goal. How do we do that? We stick to the play
book (moderation and healthy eating) and try not to get offside (eating
the wrong food) during the game. Our opposing team is called the
Temptations, and they are an experienced team who would really like to
blitz us so we fumble. We&apos;ve got a good offense and we need to block
our opponents and hang onto the ball.

Who knows...if we do a good job, maybe we&apos;ll be invited to the Lettuce
Bowl!

 Uncle Dan is continuing to improve. The doctors now have his pain

in all things.

 Day 211 
 ...Today is Get
Over It Day

 Get over it and get on with it...
 The holidays are over and it&apos;s time to start anew and
get on with it. Today was our official restart.
1. Did you weigh yourself this morning?
2. Did you record your weight?
3. Are you keeping a journal of what you eat?
4. Are you drinking plenty of water?
5. Are you eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables
each
day?
6. Are you watching what you eat for snacks?
7. Are you moving more...getting some exercise?
8. Are you practicing moderation?

We need to keep a record of our progress because without a &quot;map,&quot; we
have no way of knowing where we are if we take a wrong turn, or how to
get ourselves back on track.


 The Grapevine 
 Uncle Dan is in a lot of pain, but is doing well and, best of all,
his new kidney is already producing urine. He was up this morning,
bright and early, and although he had to go through dialysis today,
everything is going &quot;as expected.&quot; Now that&apos;s GOOD NEWS! (I typed it
&quot;GOD NEWS&quot; first and I&apos;m not so sure that &quot;God News&quot; is a typo.)

We just returned from taking a friend to Methodist Hospital to have
work done on her prosthesis. By February she is hoping to get a
natural-looking leg. She takes everything in her stride (although her
stride is a little shaky at this point) and has a cheerful outlook on
life.

There is much to learn from these two medical situations and much for
which to be thankful...for both of them and for us.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Trash the hail Mary and go for the short pass 
It&apos;s alright to have a positive attitude, but if you set your goals too
high, your chance of reaching them diminishes. Set small goals that you
can reach. Once you&apos;re up that step, set another goal. Achieving one
small step at a time will eventually add up to one large step for
success.

 ...Today is New Year&apos;s Day
...Today is Hangover Day

 Hangover? Hangover...
 For drinkers, a hangover is a next-day illness from a
night of drinking. For Faddassers, a hangover is probably what hides
your belt buckle. Many of us have them. Unfortunately, they&apos;re a little
harder to get rid of than an alcohol-induced hangover. And neither one
if healthy for you.

This is the Year of the Faddassers. Before it&apos;s over, we&apos;re going to
find our belt buckles again. We&apos;re going to see our feet. We&apos;re going
to tie our shoes with ease and we&apos;re going to look great. Tomorrow is

 What a way to start the new year! A new year and a new kidney!
Our friend &quot;Uncle Dan&quot; got a call at midnight last night that there was
a kidney available for him. Faddassers Bob and Mark took him down to
the Twin Cities at 3 this morning. I just got word (7:17 PM) that he&apos;s
on his way to the recovery room. Praise God! What a miracle.

Dan had no kidneys at all. He was on dialysis and had almost given up
hope that he&apos;d get a donor kidney. Please keep him in your prayers. He
is the brother of Pastor Bob and Kathy Goeden of our church, and the
uncle to about 3/4 of the rest of the congregation. We all love him. He
loves us back in what some of us like to call, &quot;cranky love.&quot; He
enjoys sounding crabby and we enjoy ribbing him about it. 

 Tip for Today 
 Get that Savoring Spoon 
 It was no joke . Get yourself a savoring spoon. It should be a
small spoon, like a baby spoon or iced tea spoon. Then use it. You
can&apos;t shovel as much food in your mouth. At the Hoidals, our meals
aren&apos;t over until I&apos;ve spilled on my chest so maybe I can break that
tradition when I take smaller &quot;baby&quot; bites.

 ...Today is New Year&apos;s Eve
...Today is New Year&apos;s Resolutions Day
...Today is Make Up Your Mind Day

 Make up your mind...
 Make up your mind. That&apos;s what you have to do to lose
weight. No one can do it for you, unless they do liposuction or
amputate, and we don&apos;t want that! It&apos;s a decision only you can
make and one that only you can keep. With the new year just
hours away, and resolutions on everyone&apos;s minds, think about not only
what you WANT to do this coming year, but what is realistically
feasible for you to do. Too many resolutions can undermine your
program. Remember that one small step forward is better than not moving
at all. Take that first step and regain control of your eating habits.
The year 2007 is going to be our year!!

 Hope you have special plans for welcoming in the new year, even if

conversation before retiring to the family room to turn on the game. 
 Several
minutes later, Lena came into the family room and graciously bought a
cold drink for Ole. She smiled, kissed him on the cheek and asked what
the score was. He told her it was the end of the third quarter and that
the score was still nothing to nothing.

 Day 208
 ...Today is Day Before New Year&apos;s Eve
Day

 Doesn&apos;t take a genius...
 It doesn&apos;t take a genius to figure out that today is
the day before New Year&apos;s Eve. I&apos;ll use it though because I have
nothing else on the events calendar. Sometimes things are so obvious
they&apos;re, as they say, right at the end of your nose. Right in front of
your face. Or you can&apos;t see the forest for the trees. If you&apos;re
overweight, for example. It&apos;s not something you can hide in the
closet...not unless it takes you with it. It&apos;s going to be pretty
obvious to anyone who sees you that you&apos;re not exactly willowy. You can
try and cover it up with big sweaters and tops, but you&apos;re not really
fooling anyone but yourself. Years ago when I was in TOPS, we were
weighed in a closet-like room. One of the heavier ladies would stand on
the scale and brace herself on the walls with each hand. She thought it
would make her weigh lighter, and it probably did. The lady who did the
weighing wasn&apos;t hurt by it nor was anyone else. She knew and we knew
and no one said anything.

If it&apos;s obvious that you need to lose weight, then let&apos;s do something
about it and quit fooling ourselves. Next Tuesday is the 2nd of January
and our scheduled weigh-in day. We need to jump start our eating, just
as we have to sometimes jump start our cars in the cold weather. For
some of us, a jolt of electricity may be just what we need. Make plans
for 2-Day on Tuesday . It&apos;s time.

 Savoring Spoon ---Forgot to tell you about my new savoring
spoon. When I got to church last Sunday, there was a bright red, shiny
package laying on the chair where I usually sit. When I opened it, I
found a red plastic spoon and this note: Jeremiah was using this
spoon one Saturday for lunch. Someone asked him why he was using this
spoon. He said, &quot;This spoon is my savoring spoon.&quot; Now you are the
owner of a savoring spoon.

 I believe the young man is onto something. Why not get a small
plastic spoon (red is good) and use it as your savoring spoon? Every
time you eat, use it . It will help you to remember to slow down and
savor the food; to chew the food before you swallow; and to pamper your
taste buds with flavor.

Thank you, Jeremiah!!
 
 Tip for Today 
 If you&apos;re going to drive, don&apos;t drink 
Tomorrow is the night every parent worries about: New Year&apos;s Eve. The
night when the roads are scattered with drunken drivers. If you knew
that every driver out there was drunk, you&apos;d probably stay home.
Unfortunately, you don&apos;t know. It&apos;s a guessing game and you don&apos;t know
the answer until something happens. There IS something you can do. You
can drive defensively. Drive as if your life depends upon it. It could.

 (Don&apos;t know who wrote this, but it&apos;s funny.)

 &apos;Twas the week after Christmas, and all through the house,
Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse;
With cookies to nibble, and eggnog to taste,
All the holiday parties had gone straight to my waist.

When I got on the scales, there arose such a number
When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber),
I&apos;d remember the marvelous meals I&apos;d prepared,
The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared;

The wine and the rum balls; the bread and the cheese;
And the way I&apos;d never said, &quot;No, thank you, please.&quot;
As I dressed myself in my husband&apos;s old shirt,
And prepared once again to do battle with dirt,
I said to myself, as only I can,
&quot;You can&apos;t spend a winter disguised as a man!&quot;

So, away with the last of the sour cream dip.
Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip.
Every last bit of food that I like must be banished,
&apos;Til all the additional ounces have vanished.

I won&apos;t have a cookie--not even a lick.
I&apos;ll want only to chew on a long celery stick.
I won&apos;t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie,
I&apos;ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry.

I&apos;m hungry, I&apos;m lonesome, and life is a bore,
But isn&apos;t that what January is for?
Unable to giggle, no longer a riot.
Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet!

 Day 207
 ...Today is the first day of Hogmanay
 According to Wikipedia , Hogmanay  (pronounced hog-muh-NAY) is the Scottish word for the last day of the
year and is synonymous with the celebration of the New Year in
the
Scottish manner. Its official date is the 31st of December. However
this is normally only the start of a celebration which lasts through
the night until the morning of January 1st
or, in many cases, January 2nd, which is a Scottish Bank Holiday (legal
holiday). 

 There are many customs, both national
and local, associated with
Hogmanay. The most widespread national custom is the practice of first-footing which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first
person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbor and often
involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as salt (less common today),
coal, shortbread,
whiskey, and black bun (a fruit pudding) intended to bring different
kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts, and
often Flies cemetery, which are fruit squares) are then given to the
guests. This may go on throughout the early hours
of the morning and well into the next day. The first-foot is supposed
to set the luck for the rest of the year, so it is important that a
suitable person does the job. A tall, handsome, and dark-haired man
bearing a gift is strongly preferred. According to popular folklore, a
man with dark hair was welcomed because he was assumed to be a fellow
Scotsman; a blonde or red haired stranger was assumed to be an
unwelcome Norseman.  

 The Hogmanay custom of singing Auld
Lang Syne  (a traditional poem reinterpreted by Robert Burns
which was later set to music is commonly practiced), has become common
in many countries. Outside Scotland the words are often corrupted with
a common mistake being to sing &quot;For the Sake of Auld Lang Syne&quot; in the
place of &quot;For auld lang syne!&quot; 
 First footing...
 Perhaps we could arrange it so that the &quot;first footer&quot;
at our houses would be thin and healthy looking. That could mean that
we would have a successful year at losing weight and getting healthier.
Resolution time is knocking at the door. When you open it, the old year
will whoosh into history and the new year will enter. It&apos;s going to be
a Faddasser year...I can feel it in my bones fat.

 Today is a special day for Faddasser Sandy. She turns 18! That&apos;s a

 Tip for Today 
 Spread it on! 
You can make all kinds of appetizers by using low- or no-fat cream
cheese as the base. Add a sprinkle or two of dry Ranch mix and spread
it on baked crackers. Add almond flavoring or fruit juices.
Spread it on wafers or angel food cake. Be creative.

 ...Today is Call a Friend Day

 Good idea...
 Try celebrating &quot;Call a Friend Day&quot; and dial up
someone you haven&apos;t seen or talked with for awhile. It will brighten
your day...and probably the day of the friend you call. Tuesday I
decided to call my cousin Alice and see if they were going to be home
on Wednesday. They were and so we went and visited for a few hours. It
was so much fun. We reminisced and hugged and visited her brother and
her daughters. Got a personal tour through their newly-built
church...the Baptist Church in Pillager. It burned down a couple of
years ago and now they have a brand new church. It was designed by my
cousin Don, Alice&apos;s brother, and the whole church worked on it. There&apos;s
still some finishing touches, but it is very, very nice. They even have
a gymnasium on the end of the building that can easily be turned into a
dining hall.

Feel like a snack? Get some exercise instead. As the phone company used
to say, &quot;Let your fingers do the walking.&quot; Call a friend.

 Days 204 and 205 
 ...Today is
Kwanzaa
...Today is Boxing Day
...Today is Coffee Percolator Day
...Today is St. Stephen&apos;s Day

 Boxing Day...
 Boxing Day and St. Stephen&apos;s Day are based on the same
premise: giving to those less fortunate. Wikipedia explains:
 
Because the staff had to work on such an important day as Christmas Day
by serving the master of the house and their family, they were given
the following day off. Since being kept away from their own families to
work on a traditional religious holiday and not being able to celebrate
Christmas Dinner, the customary benefit was to &quot;box&quot; up the leftover
food from Christmas Day and send it away with the servants and their
families. Hence the &quot;boxing&quot; of food became &quot;Boxing Day .&quot;

 A great idea...rather like our Food Shelf. Instead of
eating that extra food, why not put it in a box and bring it to the
food shelf? It will help those who are hungry and, also, those of us
who just hunger, but aren&apos;t actually hungry.

 Tip for Today 
 Water first... 
If you feel like you&apos;re hungry, drink a glass of water and then wait
for half an hour. If you still feel hungry, then eat. It&apos;s hard for
our bodies to distinguish between thirst and hunger. The water
will do
you good and perhaps you&apos;ll forget all about that snack.

 Illegal Alien Has
Illegitimate Birth; Baby Expected To Be
Charged With Treason 
 
 By Harold Kitchenmouse 
 BETHLEHEM -- It was rumored today that
an unmarried couple from
Nazareth stopped in a manger owned by Alfredo Pinchi, a notorious
local slumlord, and a baby was born. 

 &quot;There was no running water, and the
place was filled with straw,&quot;
commented local public health authorities. &quot;We even found a
donkey inside!&quot; 

 &quot;The mother gave birth under extremely
questionable circumstances,&quot;
offered Pontius Pilate, Judean candidate for District Attorney.
&quot;She claims to have been a virgin.&quot; 

 Unconfirmed reports indicate that Roman
authorities are
investigating the baby on charges of sedition and treason. &quot;There
are a bunch of people running around alleging that the baby is the
son of God,&quot; explained Pilate, &quot;and that he will have some radical
ideas about religion in the future.&quot; 

 Three Kings from the Orient were caught
on the outskirts of

 Day 203
 ...Today is Christmas!

 Did you remember...
 Did you remember that the celebration is about Jesus,
the babe born in the manger?
 Did you remember to sing Happy Birthday to
Jesus? 
Did you remember to say &quot;Thank you&quot; ...&quot;Thank You&quot; to God for the
greatest Gift of all time and &quot;Thank You&quot; to all who helped you
celebrate?
Did you remember Christmases past?
Did you remember to tell someone you loved them?
Did you remember to hug someone?
 Did you remember to use moderation in holiday eating?
If you did, then you had a great holiday.
 
 The Grapevine 
 Our Faddassers are all over the place...many of them traveling. We
pray that they have a safe journey. This old hen will be much more
comfortable when all the chicks are back in their nests.

Tomorrow we need to jump start our program. Tuesday has been our
weigh-in day. Tomorrow is also Tuesday, so don&apos;t have a heart attack
when you step on the scale. Stay calm. We&apos;re going to get through this
together with healthy eating and moderation. You can do. So can I.
Let&apos;s go!
 
 Tip for Today 
 It can wait... 
If there&apos;s no emergency, &quot;it&quot; can wait. Just like our food, you need to
savor this holy season. Do what you have to do, but don&apos;t get so
absorbed in &quot;things&quot; that you forget the real meaning. It&apos;s a joyful
time. Most of the festivities should be done so the stress should be
gone...or at least waning. Stress causes many people to eat more. Don&apos;t
stress yourself out by getting everything done by tonight. Believe it
or not, your family will survive if the house isn&apos;t perfection and the
garbage isn&apos;t out until tomorrow. In fact, they&apos;ll probably even
survive if you take a nap, leave the dishes until tomorrow, or sit down
and read your new book. Sit in the dark and look at the Christmas tree;
concentrate on it; appreciate the beauty. Your body will relax and your
soul will be refreshed.

 Every Christmas
morning, when her kids were little, she read them the nativity story
out of the big, family Bible.

When her son was old enough to talk, he asked her what a stable was.

She thought for a moment about how to explain it to him in terms he
could
understand, then told him, &quot;It&apos;s something like your sister&apos;s room, but
without a stereo.&quot;

 Why Jesus is better than Santa Claus 
 
 Santa lives at the North Pole ... 
   JESUS is everywhere.

 Santa rides in a sleigh ... 
   JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the water.

 Santa comes but once a year ... 
   JESUS is an ever present help.

 Santa fills your stockings with goodies ... 
   JESUS supplies all your needs.

 Santa comes down your chimney uninvited ... 
   JESUS stands at your door and knocks, and then
enters your heart
when invited.

 You have to wait in line to see Santa ... 
   JESUS is as close as the mention of His name.

 Santa lets you sit on his lap ... 
   JESUS lets you rest in His arms.

 Santa doesn&apos;t know your name, all he can say is
&quot;Hi little boy (or girl,) what&apos;s your name?&quot; ... 
   JESUS knew our name before we did. Not only does He
know our name,
He knows our address      too. He
knows our history and future and
He even knows how many hairs are on our heads.

 Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly ... 
   JESUS has a heart full of love.

 All Santa can offer is HO HO HO ... 
   JESUS offers health, help and hope.

 Santa says &quot;You better not cry&quot; ... 
JESUS says &quot;Cast all your cares on me for I care for you.&quot;

 Santa&apos;s little helpers make toys ... 
   JESUS makes new life, mends wounded hearts, repairs
broken homes
and builds mansions.

 Santa is a &quot;jolly old elf&quot; 
   JESUS is the King of Kings

 Santa may make you chuckle but ... 
   JESUS gives you joy that is your strength.

 While Santa puts gifts under your tree ... 
   JESUS became our gift and died on a tree. 

 Don&apos;t know who wrote this, but it is awesome.

 ...Today is Two Days to Go Day
...Today is Popcorn Popping Day
...Today is Feast of the Radishes --- A Mexican celebration where carved radishes
are displayed, buñuelos are served,
and ceramic plates are smashed in the streets. Buñuelos are fritters that are a popular dessert in many Latin American
countries, and are traditionally eaten at Christmas. They typically
consist of a simple, wheat-based yeast dough, often
flavored with anise, that is thinly rolled, cut or shaped into
individual pieces, then fried and finished off with a sweet topping.

 The commercial part should be over...
 The commercial part of
Christmas...the shopping...should be over. There are a few stragglers
who will be shopping until closing time tomorrow, but, hopefully, most
people are ready to celebrate. Our physical needs wants seem to have overpowered our spiritual needs during this season.
We need to remember that it&apos;s the birth of the baby that&apos;s important.
It&apos;s not eating so much that you look like you&apos;re about to
give birth to a baby.

 Eat moderately, taste joyfully, and worship gratefully.

 It&apos;s amazing how each Fadd Gram has a different impact on our
Faddassers. One of our Faddassers wrote that she was having a &quot;whopper
of a week&quot; and then read Mark&apos;s Disturbed Christmas Carols . It
brightened her day and the rest of her week. Others have written that
something we talked about was just what they needed. We all have
different needs so it&apos;s rewarding to hear that the Fadd Grams help.

The farewell for Emily, our Australian exchange student, was a great
party. Lots of people, lots of food, and plenty of fellowship. She&apos;s
not leaving until January 2nd so we need to pack in lots more memories
in the next week.

 Smile for Today 
 &apos; Twas the night before Christmas and all round my hips
Were Fannie May candies that sneaked past my lips.
Fudge brownies were stored in the freezer with care
In hopes that my thighs would forget they were there.
I in my girdle and my spouse in chin straps
Had just settled down to sugar-borne naps.
When out in the pantry there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the kitchen I flew like a flash
Tore open the icebox, then threw up the sash.
The marshmallow look of the new-fallen snow
Sent thoughts of a binge to my body below.

When what to my wandering eyes should appear
But a marzipan Santa with eight chocolate reindeer!
That huge chunk of candy, so luscious and slick
I knew in a second that I&apos;d wind up sick.

The sweet-coated Santa, those sugared reindeer
I closed my eyes tightly, but still I could hear;
On Pritzker, on Stillman, on weak one, on TOPS
A Weight Watcher dropout from sugar detox.

&gt;From the top of the scales to the top of the hall
Now dash away pounds; now dash away all.
Dressed up in Lane Bryant from my head to nightdress
My clothes were all bulging from too much excess.

My droll little mouth and my round little belly
They shook when I laughed like a bowl full of jelly.
I spoke not a word, but went straight to my work
Ate all of the candy, then turned with a jerk.

And laying a finger beside my heartburn
I gave a quick nod and to the bedroom I turned.
I eased into bed, to the heavens I cry
&quot;If temptation&apos;s removed, I&apos;ll get thin by and by.&quot;

And I mumbled again as I turned for the night
&quot;In the morning I&apos;ll starve . . . &apos;til I take that first bite.&quot; ---

 We have a farewell party tonight for Emily, our Australian exchange
student. When I say &quot;our,&quot; I don&apos;t mean that she stayed with us, but
she has been a part of our church family for the past year. She&apos;s a
lovely girl and we will miss her a lot, but I&apos;m sure she&apos;s anxious to
get back &quot;down under&quot; and see her family again.

One of our Faddassers e-mailed that I needed to come up with a sponge
cake recipe to use up all the left-over egg yolks from the angel food
cake recipe. I looked up a sponge cake recipe that uses 6 egg yolks and
thought I had solved the problem. As I typed the ingredients, up popped
6 egg whites further down the list. So much for that. Then I looked on www.allrecipes.com and found one called
&quot;Egg-Yolk Sponge Cake.&quot; All Recipes is a great site.

Also, here is a good site for tips on using left-over egg yolks. http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/leftovereggyolks.htm

...Today is Crossword Puzzle Day

 Looking at the Bright Side...
 That&apos;s a day worth celebrating. We often think that
things are so tough for us, but we&apos;ve got it pretty good. Like to lose
weight? Be thankful we have food. Look at the people in the Third World
countries with their pathetic expressions and their protruding ribs.
Feel badly that you&apos;re missing holiday celebrations because of the flu?
How do you think terminally-ill people feel when they think about
missing the rest of their lives?

Be thankful. Be very thankful. We are so blessed. This is a good time
to contribute to a charity or two. We have so much and so many have so
little. There&apos;s still time to share the holidays. As Mother Teresa
said: &quot;If you can&apos;t feed a hundred people, then just feed one.&quot; Like
weight loss, giving begins with just one small step.  

 The Grapevine 
 Lots of our Faddassers will be traveling in the next few days. Drive

Speaking of being thankful...be thankful you&apos;re not sitting in the
Denver airport or even not sitting in the airport, but digging
your car out of two feet of snow. A white Christmas is nice, but
Mother Nature went overboard on her holiday &quot;spending&quot;...just like so
many of the rest of us.
 
 Tip for Today 
 &quot;The&quot; Angel Food Cake Recipe 
1 cup cake flour
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
12 egg whites (1-1/2 cups)
1-1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Stir together flour and first amount of
sugar; set aside. In a large mixer bowl, beat egg whites, cream of
tartar and salt until foamy. Add second amount of sugar, 2 tablespoons
at a time, beating on high speed until meringue holds stiff peaks.
Gently fold in flavorings. Sprinkle flour-sugar mixture, 1/4 cup at a
time over meringue, folding in gently just until flour-sugar mixture
disappears. Push batter into ungreased tube pan, 10x4 inches. Gently
cut through the batter. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until top springs back
when touched lightly with finger. Invert tube pan on funnel; let hang
until cake is completely cool.

 From Eileen: I
completely mix it with the electric mixer. I start it on
high beating egg whites and then beating in the second amount of
sugar. Then I put the mixer on the lowest setting and add the
flavorings and flour sugar mixture. I also use real vanilla, not
the
artificial flavored ones. - Eileen

 After being away on business for a week before Christmas,
Tom thought it would be nice to bring his wife a little gift.

&quot;How about some perfume?&quot; he asked the cosmetics clerk. She showed him
a bottle costing $50.

&quot;That&apos;s a bit much,&quot; said Tom, so she returned with a smaller bottle
for $30.

&quot;That&apos;s still quite a bit,&quot; Tom groused.

Growing disgusted, the clerk brought out a tiny $15 bottle.

Tom grew agitated, &quot;What I mean,&quot; he said, &quot;is I&apos;d like to see
something real cheap.&quot;

So the clerk handed him a mirror.

 ...Today was Jean&apos;s Retirement Party
...Today is Dot Your I&apos;s with Smileys Day

 It was a wonderful day in the neighborhood...
 What a wonderful day I had today! About 200 people
came for our open house and my retirement party and I had so much fun.
Got three vases of red roses, a mixed floral arrangement, and a pine
arrangement. This is the first time I&apos;ve had a moment to myself since 5
this morning and I&apos;m exhausted, but it&apos;s an exhilarating exhaustion.
Never had so many hugs in my life. What great friends I have.

Thanks to all of you who showed up, to those of you who sent messages,
and to those of you who thought about me. I appreciate it.

 The Grapevine 
 My dear friend Jean came all the way from St. Cloud and although she
could stay only a few minutes, it was wonderful seeing her. What a nice
surprise.

I have been inundated with food today. We had a great buffet at the
retirement party and then tonight we had our Bible Study party at
Brookside Manor (a retirement home, for those of you who don&apos;t know).
Faddasser Eileen makes the best angel food cake I&apos;ve ever tasted and I
had two pieces to celebrate. Actually, if you&apos;re going to splurge,
angel food cake isn&apos;t a bad thing to splurge on. I asked her once for
her special recipe and she said, &quot;It&apos;s easy. It&apos;s in the old Betty
Crocker Cookbook.&quot; I&apos;ll put the recipe in the Fadd Gram some
night
when I&apos;m not so tired.

 ...Today is a Christmas Carol Day
...Today is Greetings from Space Day

 Heritage vs Hair-itage...
 We are funny people...odd even. No one thinks twice if
we make fun of our heritage by doing Ole and Lena jokes, but do a
blonde joke and we are offensive. &quot;Hair-itage&quot; jokes are politically
incorrect. This is interesting since you have no choice in your
heritage. It&apos;s the lineage you are born with. Hair color, on the other
hand, is as near as your drug store and can be changed at will.

My lineage is full of plump people...on both sides. We&apos;re eaters; we
enjoy food. I&apos;ve always tried to blame my weight problems on my
lineage, but like hair color, most of the time weight can be changed.
Not as easily as a dip in dye, but by moderation and healthy eating.
(And no Christmas cookies.)

Enjoy yourself the next few days because we&apos;re going full bore on this
losing weight business after Christmas. 

 The Grapevine 
 Still waiting for input on the first six months of our Faddasser

there is food involved. Sounds like the weather may hold off so I&apos;m

 Dessert for Today 
 Strawberry Angel Fluff 
This is a quick and tasty dessert.
1 container of Strawberry Philadelphia cream cheese (the
soft kind in the little round container)
1 carton of Cool Whip (low cal)
1 angel food cake
 Mix one carton of Strawberry Philadelphia Cream
Cheese with a carton of low-cal Cool Whip. I usually beat the
cream
cheese first so it&apos;s fluffy and then fold in the Cool Whip. You
can either frost slices of angel food cake or cut the cake into cubes. If
you choose to do the cubes, then put them in a cake pan and let the
mixture &quot;set&quot; for a couple of hours. Garnish with frozen strawberries
or almonds.

This also works with the berry cream cheese, too.

 A
Parents Night Before Christmas 

  &apos;Twas the night
before
Christmas when all through the house
I searched for the tools to hand to my spouse.
Instructions were studied and we were inspired,
In hopes we could manage &quot;Some Assembly Required.&quot; 

 The children were quiet
(not asleep) in their beds,
While Dad and I faced the evening with dread:
A kitchen, two bikes, Barbie&apos;s town house to boot!
And, thanks to Grandpa, a train with a toot! 

 We opened the boxes, my
heart skipped a beat....
Let no parts be missing or parts incomplete!
Too late for last-minute returns or replacement;
If we can&apos;t get it right, it goes in the basement! 

 When what to my worrying
eyes should appear,
But 50 sheets of directions, concise, but not clear,
With each part numbered and every slot named,
So if we failed, only we could be blamed. 

 More rapid than eagles the
parts then fell out,
All over the carpet they were scattered about.
&quot;Now bolt it! Now twist it! Attach it right there!
Slide on the seats, and staple the stair!
Hammer the shelves, and nail to the stand.&quot;
&quot;Honey,&quot; said hubby, &quot;you just glued my hand.&quot; 

 And then in a twinkling, I
knew for a fact
That all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact
To keep parents busy all Christmas Eve night
With &quot;assembly required&quot; till morning&apos;s first light. 

 We spoke not a word, but
kept bent at our work,
Till our eyes, they went bleary; our fingers all hurt.
The coffee went cold and the night, it wore thin
Before we attached the last rod and last pin. 

 Then laying the tools away
in the chest,
We fell into bed for a well-deserved rest.
But I said to my husband just before I passed out,
&quot;This will be the best Christmas, without any doubt. 

 Tomorrow we&apos;ll cheer, let
the holiday ring,
And not have to run to the store for a thing!
We did it! We did it! The toys are all set
For the perfect, most perfect, Christmas, I bet!&quot; 
 Then off to dreamland and
sweet repose I gratefully went,
Though I suppose there&apos;s something to say for those self-deluded...
I&apos;d forgotten that BATTERIES are never included!

 Day 196
 ...Today is Bake Cookies Day
...Today is Flake Appreciation Day
...Today is Mother Goose Day

 Appreciate the flakes in your life...
 Whether it&apos;s your cereal, your detergent, your
relatives, or the snowy particles that fall from the clouds, we might
as well celebrate Flake Day instead of baking cookies. Much healthier.
Read a few nursery rhymes and &quot;flake out,&quot; so to speak. You can still
have the holiday spirit without the holiday weight gain.

I can vouch for that. I had someone else bake the cookies, but couldn&apos;t
stay out of them and gained two pounds over the last week. Finally
realized my willpower had gone bonkers and sent the cookies to church
to share. What it all boils down to is this: if you can&apos;t stay out of
the cookies, you&apos;d better get out of the kitchen until you get your
willpower repaired. (Willpower has never been one of my strong suits
and since you lose different faculties as you age, the prospects don&apos;t
look that good for any improvement. There is one positive thing about
the golden years...if my memory keeps going, I can hide the cookies and
not be able to find them.)

 My first Monday of retirement and I only had to put in 12-1/2 hours.
Scott says he&apos;s hoping to cut it way back to only 11 hours for the rest

but when she slept so did I so it wasn&apos;t all bad. 

 Tip for Today 
 Fruit Baskets... 
Fruit baskets are wonderful holiday choices and much healthier for you
than all the sweets. The Clementine tangerines are very good and the
apples have a great crunch. A nice mixture to suit everyone&apos;s taste
buds.

 ...Today is Cookie Cutter Day
...Today is Wright Brothers Day
...This is the first day of Tell Someone They&apos;re Doing a Good Job Week

 Cookie cutter image...
 Cookie cutters make the same image, over and over.
Each cookie looks exactly the same. Same shape, same size, same color.
While it&apos;s a handy, dandy way to cut out cookies, it&apos;s not something
that we want to encourage in our daily lives. It would be pretty boring
if we all looked the same. God created each of us as an individual star
and like snowflakes, unless you&apos;re an identical twin, no two are alike.
Be the best that you can be by highlighting your good points and
working to improve those bad points. And above all, be unique. You
don&apos;t need to be like everyone else. Be happy with yourself and you&apos;ll
be happier with everyone else.

 The Grapevine 
 Our Christmas is over...at least the family gift-giving part.
Christmas continues as we celebrate the Birth, but now we can sit back
and enjoy it, or, as I always emphasize, savor the season.
This afternoon Mackenzie complained of a sore throat and when her Dad
looked, it was red and raw, with big white blisters, so it looks like
we&apos;re in for a bout of strep throat. Thankfully, she had been to the
doctor for an earache on Friday and he gave Scott a prescription for
antibiotics, in case she ran a fever. So tomorrow I won&apos;t have to worry
about not going to work. My new &quot;job&quot; calls since she won&apos;t be able to
go to school. 

 Tip for Today 
 Cutting fat, not vitamins 
Be careful that you get your five servings of fruit and vegetables each
day. Sometimes we concentrate so much on eliminating fat content that
we forget about making sure we&apos;re getting the balanced diet that we
need each day. Now that we&apos;re in the flu season, it&apos;s even more
important because we need those vitamins to fight off the germs. Drink
lots of citrus juice and remember to have 8 glasses of water.

 Day 194
 ...Today is Sleep Comfort Day
...Today is Beethoven&apos;s Birthday

 ZZZZZZs are important...
 Today is Sleep Comfort Day. If you&apos;re waking up in the
morning and dragging yourself out of bed, then you need to take a look
at your sleeping schedule. I found the following information on http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/obesity/a/sleepweight.htm . I t is entitled &quot;Less Sleep, More Weight.&quot;
This is just part of it. I encourage you to go read the full article. 

 A recent study reveals that the number of hours slept has an
influence on
the risk of obesity. The less we sleep, the more at risk we are. This
fact could explain why people who suffer from sleep apnea, a known
thief of sleep, tend to gain weight at an above normal rate. 
 It&apos;s a known fact that obesity is a major factor in sleep
apnea,
and is often listed as one of the main causes. But that appears to be a
two-way street. Once a person becomes a victim of sleep apnea, without
very strict dietary control, even more pounds pile on. 

 Sleep apnea causes sleep deprivation, and, of course, the
more
sleep deprived a person becomes, the less active he or she is. Less
exercise causes weight gain .
 
How many reasons do we need before we realize the importance of
sleep in our lives? And yet, still we skimp, putting everything else in
our lives first. Four hours sleep, five hours sleep, anything less than
the seven (as the least) to nine hours sleep we need is asking for
trouble. It could lead to a loss of physical and mental health, to poor
memory, poor coordination, and now, to weight gain and obesity. 

 It&apos;s time we all wake up. No! Go to sleep for a healthier
and slimmer population.

 The Hoidals are having their Christmas later this afternoon. It is
now 12:09 and I haven&apos;t started wrapping gifts yet. (Remember: I&apos;m also
the Procrastinator Queen.) Once the Fadd Gram is done, I&apos;m headed for
the family room and wrapping paper. I&apos;ve been blessed with a son who is
a gourmet cook so he is hosting the whole shebang. I just have to go
over and enjoy myself and leave him to find solutions for sleeping
accommodations.

Still waiting for those replies to my question on what the Fadd program
has done for you. Two is nice, but more would be nicer.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Skim off the calories 
It&apos;s cocoa season. The other day we had the Cocoa Mix recipe. No time
for that? Use what you have, but substitute skim milk and get rid
of
95% of the fat.

 From Steven Wright...
 I can
remember the first time I had to go to sleep. Mom said, &quot;Steven,
time to go to sleep.&quot; I said, &quot;But I don&apos;t know how.&quot; She said, &quot;It&apos;s
real easy. Just go down to the end of tired and hang a left.&quot; So I went
down to the end of tired, and just out of curiosity, I hung a right. My
mother was there, and she said &quot;I thought I told you to go to sleep.&quot;

 Day 193
 ...Today is Lemon Cupcake Day
...Today is Underdog Day
...Today is Firefighters Day

 An ounce of prevention...
 Today we salute our firemen. And our firewomen.
Firepeople? Those who put out fires: we salute you. A dangerous job and
we appreciate what you do. Smokey Bear urges us to be careful for &quot;Only
you can prevent forest fires.&quot; Every October the fire stations have
Open House and educate us on how to prevent fires. Prevention is their
motto.

As Faddassers, we would do well to listen to them, follow their
rules, and apply prevention
to our daily eating.
 Rule Number One : Plan ahead . You can&apos;t eat it if it&apos;s
not there. This is a double-edged sword. If you have healthy food
on
hand, you&apos;ll eat it. If you don&apos;t buy junk food, then you won&apos;t eat it.
(Unless you&apos;re desperate and then it won&apos;t matter...you&apos;ll find a way.
What&apos;s 15 miles on icy roads when it comes to satisfying a craving for
chocolate?) Plan ahead and shop wisely.
 Rule Number Two : Prepare your family . If your family
knows that the only snack in the house is an apple and not potato
chips, do you know what? They&apos;ll grumble, but they&apos;ll eat the apple
and, though they&apos;d never admit it, enjoy the taste sensation of that
first bite into a crisp apple. It&apos;s the element of surprise that raises
their dander. &quot;What...we&apos;re out of Oreos?&quot;
 Rule Number Three : First Aid . Normally, you wouldn&apos;t
need to know first aid for losing weight, but there are times when you
&quot;bite off more than you can chew&quot; that a little Heimlich may come in
handy. Or knowing how to dress an open wound in case you &quot;bite the hand
that feeds you.&quot; They also recommend preparing a Home Disaster
Preparedness Kit . Another good idea. If the football game comes on
and there&apos;s no snacks, it could be a real disaster, but if you&apos;ve
followed Rule Number One, you&apos;ll be healthy and happy and, hopefully,
your team will win.

When it comes to fire prevention, these are serious rules. When it
comes to good health, they&apos;re also serious rules. (Except maybe Rule
Number Three, which is a little facetious.)

 3:47 PM, December 15, 2006
For me that was D-Day. Today was my last day of work. By 3 o&apos;clock I
was doing last-minute notes through misty eyes. By 3:15 I was trying to
focus through the tears that streamed out of my eyes and down my
cheeks. By 3:30 my &quot;roommate&quot; had to get a new box of Kleenex. Goodbyes
are difficult, but I&apos;m sure retirement is going to be satisfying, so it
was just another speed bump on the road of life. By Wednesday, when we
have the Retirement Party, I should be in great spirits. I wanted to be
a more shapely vision, but I&apos;ll just be a vision instead. Got a new
dress and I&apos;m going out in style!

When I went to clock out (we use fingerprints) my print kept being
denied. I was beginning to wonder if God was trying to tell me
something, but after six tries, Bingo! I was clocked out and retired.
Went right straight to my son&apos;s house to begin my nanny career. That&apos;s
why the Fadd Gram is a little late.

Don&apos;t mean to be so wordy, but as I typed the &quot;Today is...&quot; I wondered
if I had missed something in my life. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had a
lemon cupcake, and here&apos;s a day dedicated not just to cupcakes, but
LEMON cupcakes.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Is your house number clearly visible? 
Do you even HAVE a house number? Make sure your house number is visible
from the street—emergency
personnel will need to find your house in a hurry. The best place for your house number on your house is near the front
door, at or slightly above eye level and lit by a light . When
you
drive home at nighttime, check to see if your house number is clearly
visible. Consider moving the number or adding additional lighting if
necessary.   And finally, make sure
your
mailbox number faces the traffic side of the street.

 Day 192
 ...Today is Deck the Halls Day
...Today is Opposites Attract Day
...Today is Buy a Tree Day

 Are you done shopping?
 Or haven&apos;t you started? The people who deliver the
Sunday newspapers have to be very strong this time of the year. The
inserts must weigh at least 10 pounds. So many bargains...so many
options. Are you a Christmas Eve shopper? Or are you organized and all
done? The bargains don&apos;t stop at the mall. The grocery stores are
overflowing with Christmas treats. How much do you buy on impulse?
Remember: if you don&apos;t have it, you can&apos;t eat it. Of course, you can
always run to the store and replenish your supply, but the best plan is
not to buy it in the first place. Do a Santa-thing and make a list.
Check it twice. Be nice, but don&apos;t be naughty and buy tons of treats.
The happiness of Christmas will still be there, chocolate or no
chocolate. After all, it is CHRISTmas...not CANDYmas...or
CHOCOLATEmas...or GIFTmas. Enjoy the real reason for the season.

 ...Today is Cocoa Day
...This is Read a Good Book Month

 Temptation is just around the corner...
 That&apos;s right. Temptation is lurking just around the
corner, waiting to pounce on us. Temptation is found holding a plate of
cookies out to us. Temptation is found offering dishes of candy and
bowls
of salted peanuts. Temptation is found insisting we try lefse and
rommegrot and fruit soup. Temptation is a real party animal at holiday
parties. Temptation is found all over the place at Christmas time.
There&apos;s only one place where you won&apos;t find Temptation... where
they&apos;re serving lutefisk.

There&apos;s no getting around it. Unless you&apos;re a hermit, it&apos;s pretty hard
not to run into Temptation sometime or somewhere during this season.
It&apos;s a time to enjoy yourself, so do it...in moderation. Taste, but
don&apos;t overeat. Sip, but don&apos;t overindulge. Do the best you can to
practice moderation. My feeling is that if we get through the holidays
without gaining, we&apos;re doing a great job.

 THE HUSBAND STORE
A store that sells husbands has just opened in New York City, where a
woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the
entrance is a description of how the store operates. You may visit the
store ONLY ONCE!

There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the
shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch . . . you may
choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a
floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building. 

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. .

On the first floor the sign on the door reads:
 Floor 1 - These men have jobs and love the Lord. 

The second floor sign reads:
 Floor 2 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, and love kids.
 
The third floor sign reads:
 Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, and are
extremely good looking.
 
&quot;Wow,&quot; she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads:
 Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are
drop-dead good looking and help with the housework. 

&quot;Oh mercy me&quot; she exclaims, &quot;I can hardly stand it!&quot; Still, she
goes
to the fifth floor and sign reads:

 Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are
drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic
streak. 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign
reads:

 Floor 6 - You are visitor 4,363,012 to this floor. There are no men
on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are
impossible to please. 

 Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. Watch your step as you
exit the building, and have a nice day!

 Our Lady of Guadalupe

to a peasant. The occasion is celebrated every year in Mexico as their
most famous religious festival. 
 
 Scrub, scrub, scrub...
 It&apos;s flu time again and the best way to stay healthy
is to wash your hands...many times a day. By touching other people and
things other people have touched, you pick up germs that can then be
spread directly into your system when you touch your nose or mouth with
your hands. Good hygiene remains your primary defense against
contagious diseases.

The Mayo Clinic offers these instructions for proper hand washing
 
 Proper hand washing with soap and water 
Follow these instructions for washing with soap and water: 

 Wet your hands with warm, running water and apply liquid
or clean bar soap. Lather well. Rub your hands vigorously together for at least 15 seconds
to loosen the germs. (15 seconds is two verses of &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;)
 Scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands,
wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Rinse well. It will help wash the germs off your hands.
 Dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel. Use a towel to turn off the faucet.

 Be careful what you wish for...
 How many times have you heard that phrase? I&apos;m kind of
experiencing it this week. I&apos;ve wished for many years to
retire...looked forward to it, in fact...but today when I checked my
time sheet and realized it would be my last full pay check, I got a
little nostalgic. Nostalgic partly because I&apos;ll miss the people I talk
with every day and partly because I like to spend money. :-) 

As much as I want to be thin, it&apos;s not always the blessing that we
imagine. The other day I saw someone who was anorexic; I also saw a

 One small step...
 This weekend while I was putting cream cheese on a
sliced bagel, I had a revelation. If you&apos;re going to put the two sides
together, there&apos;s no need to put cream cheese on both sides. Simple
enough, but not what I&apos;m in the habit of doing. I butter both slices of
bread, put peanut butter on both slices, and then smash them together.
I could save calories by buttering just one slice. Better yet, I could
use moderation and just eat one slice of toast or one-half of the bagel.

There are lots of things that we do from habit that can be changed.
Small changes can add up to bigger weight losses. So think while you&apos;re
preparing the food and again as you eat it. Half a loaf is better than
none...and has a lot less calories.

your thighs, perhaps.

 Fondue dipping 
Fondue is a holiday tradition with a lot of families. Here&apos;s a low-cal
recipe for the chocolate dip.

3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 teaspoons cornstarch
2/3 cup evaporated skim milk
Mix the sugar, cocoa and cornstarch together in a small sauce pan. Add
the evaporated milk and cook over medium heat until it bubbles and
thickens. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Hint: Don&apos;t use high
heat or the mixture will cook too fast and become lumpy. Dip fresh
fruit pieces into the warm chocolate. Try strawberries, bananas,
pineapple chunks and grapes. There are only 4 grams of fat in the whole
batch of chocolate.

 Weary Willie...
 Weary Willie Day is a
tribute to the famous clown created by Emmett Kelly. Weary Willie was
based on the hobos of the Depression era and was unique because he did
not have a white face and was a &quot;tragic&quot; clown...not a funny one. His
signature routine was when he swept the circus rings after the other
performances and tried to sweep up the pool of light coming from a
spotlight. This was a totally new concept, since clowns were known for
doing slapstick stunts intended to make people laugh. He was a major
attraction with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus and
was famous world-wide.

Perhaps we Faddassers should celebrate today by vowing to stop clowning
around and get serious about our weight losses. Those pounds are a lot
like the spotlight that poor Willie tried to sweep up...very evasive
and hard to pin down. Instead of sweeping up after others, as Willie
did, we need to clean up our own acts.

   Meanwhile, line a small baking sheet with aluminum
foil. Lightly
spray with vegetable oil spray.
   In a small, heavy skillet, cook the sugar over
medium heat for 6-10
minutes, or until it dissolves and liquefies, stirring frequently with

...Today is Microwave Oven Day

 Mike it...
 Whatever did we do before the microwave oven? I
remember when they first came out and how expensive they were and how
big and clumsy. It&apos;s kind of like computers. They get smaller and
smaller with more and more storage. The prices have come down a LOT on
them, also. I got my first computer, an Apple Classic, in 1988. Along
with the printer, it cost me almost $2,000. It was obsolete before I
had the third payment made. Cute little thing. I still have it. Very
compact.

The microwave oven has made healthier eating much easier. No more
frying to warm up leftovers. Just pop it in the microwave and warm it
up. There are many frozen dinners, entrees and snacks...all of them can
be warmed in the microwave. You have a vast menu of choices. Have some
healthy frozen food on hand for those times when you need to make
something in a hurry. Just remember that not everything you microwave
is low-cal. Check out the calories in some of the microwave popcorn and
you&apos;ll see what I mean.

Make good choices.

 The Grapevine 
 I was looking for some of the slang terms for microwave. I
came up
with mike it, nuke it, and zap it. A nukeorphan is something
you&apos;ve
forgotten in the microwave and a microwave is called a nukeulator. Let
me know if you can come up with other terms for microwave. It&apos;s
interesting how these slang terms spring up and explode into our
vocabularies. 

 Microwave Tips 

 Size ---Always use a
dish twice the size of what you are putting into it to avoid your food
spilling out. 
 Salt ---Do not
add until cooking is finished. Salt draws out moisture. Sugar (brown) ---Loosen
hard-packed sugar by placing an apple slice in the bag and microwaving
at full power 5 seconds. Vegetables ---Cook
on high power. Figure around 6-7 minutes per pound. Add butter to the
water before cooking. Cook in beef, chicken or vegetable broth for
better flavor. Cover dark green vegetables with wax paper for better
flavor and color.

 ...Today is Full Moon Day
...Today is Blue Jeans Day

 How do YOUR jeans fit...
 Today is Blue Jeans Day. I think every overweight
woman (or a good percentage of them) has a goal to look good in a pair
of jeans. It&apos;s something we strive for. You never consider yourself
really thin unless you look good in jeans. To meet the huge range of
sizes in the marketplace, manufacturers have come up with all kinds of
styles: regular fit, relaxed fit, straight leg, boot cut, slim leg,
flare leg...and even skinny jeans. According to wikipedia, the average
American owns seven pairs of jeans. Go to the site, it&apos;s really
interesting. There&apos;s a lot more to it than just Levi Strauss. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans
 
It&apos;s common knowledge that jeans are usually worn tight...that is,
there is no bagging in the strategic places...but there are people who
make you wonder where they found a shoe horn large enough to squeeze
them into their jeans. When Marilyn Monroe made the movie, &quot;The River
of No Return,&quot; she wore jeans that were tight to start with, and then
they sat her in a tub of water so they would shrink against her as they
dried. The movie magazines said that she had to remove them, she had to
have them cut off. I know skinny people who have to lay down on their
bed to zip their jeans. (Everything rolls down the sides, leaving a
flatter tummy...until you stand up, but by then the zipper can hold it

I think, as Faddassers, we&apos;ve kind of fallen into the &quot;relaxed fit
mode.&quot; We&apos;re pretty comfortable with what we are, at this point, and if
this size gets uncomfortable, we&apos;ve always got the old &quot;big-sized

and
go for the skinnies. Eat right. Use moderation. And exercise.

 A man and woman were having dinner in a
fine restaurant. Their waitress,
taking another order at a table a few steps away, suddenly noticed that
the
man was slowly sliding down his chair and under the table, but the
woman
acted unconcerned.

The waitress watched as the man slid all the way down his chair and out
of
sight under the table.

Still, the woman appeared calm and unruffled, apparently unaware that
her
dining companion had disappeared.

The waitress went over to the table and said to the woman, &quot;Pardon me,
ma&apos;am, but I think your husband just slid under the table.&quot;

The woman calmly looked up at her and said, &quot;No he didn&apos;t. He just
walked in the door.&quot;

 Eat right, stay fit, practice moderation...
 From Faddasser Bob: 
 I caught the word
&quot;moderation,&quot; and thought this was interesting. People that live
to be 100 say they eat right, stay fit, practice moderation. Most
say
faith in God plays a big part. By and large, they are the most
positive people I have ever known. Age and infirmity haven&apos;t
dampened
their zest for living. There&apos;s the 101-year-old man who
walks a half
mile each day. The 107-year-old woman who never misses a Red Sox
game. The former Ziegfeld Follies star who still dances. ---By Willard Scott from the
Today Show     Wonder which one
or two of the Faddassers will make it to 100?

We may not all make it to 100, Bob, but we can increase our chances of
making it to retirement by following this good advice.

 Tomorrow is weigh-in day again. Barring any severe thunderstorms, I
should be able to get back on schedule. The wind early this morning was
so wild, it sounded like the roof was coming off. Maybe some of
my

How about you? Are you ready to face the scale in the morning? Let me
know how you&apos;re doing.

Am wondering about Sandy, my traveling companion. She moved from her
house to an apartment today. The last time I talked with her, which was
about a week ago, she hadn&apos;t started packing. Don&apos;t you just love
procrastination? A woman after my own heart. Somehow it always gets
done, so why stress yourself out? Would like an update from her family
please!
 
 Trivia for Today 
 What part water? 
Did you know that a half-cup of broccoli is 91% water by weight? Hard
to believe. It&apos;s such a solid, crunchy vegetable. On the other hand, a
half-cup of watermelon has only 1% more water by weight...92%. With a
name like &quot;water&quot; melon, that goes without saying. (So why did I just
say it? I confuse even myself sometimes.) Lettuce has the most...95%
for a half-cup.

 Wrong dimension? 
Have you ever wondered if you might be in the wrong dimension?
Telescope Day made me think of that. What if the whole world is looking
through the wrong end of the universe&apos;s telescope and we are actually
too thin; that if they flip the telescope around, we&apos;ll look almost
emaciated. In another dimension, I am &quot;normal.&quot; In another dimension,
I&apos;m taller and thinner. I think it&apos;s all being done by mirrors. So...if
you look in the mirror and the image is distorted, then perhaps it&apos;s
not in the eyes of the beholder. Perhaps it&apos;s the telescope.

Be happy with yourself the way you are. Do what you can to make
yourself healthier. Then tell God about it and leave the rest to Him.
We make it so difficult sometimes.

Later that night, when I checked my e-mail, I had this from Faddasser

 Kissed again...
 Just when I&apos;ve come to terms with my fudgesicle
withdrawal problems, Hershey&apos;s comes out with a new kiss...one that
tastes like chocolate-covered cherries. One of the &quot;wicked elves&quot; put a
bag of them on the lunch table at work and, since it would have been
discourteous to not have one, I did. Now I have another detour on my
journey, which has become more like a pile of spaghetti than a straight
and narrow path. My Dad loved chocolate-covered cherries and they were
one of our Christmas traditions.

While at County Market today, I was going to show them to Lyle because
he really likes chocolate-covered cherries and I like to keep him
happy. (Not for any reason of my own.) Didn&apos;t find them, but I
discovered they have caramel ones, too. I already have tangled with the
chocolate almond kisses. I can see the holiday season is really going
to be tempting.

What to do? What to do. Why not give someone you love a REAL kiss. No
calories and it also raises your endorphin levels...possibly more than
chocolate. Plus, you don&apos;t have to run to the store to replenish the
supply. (That is, unless you&apos;re in love with the butcher or the baker.)

 Potluck at church tomorrow. The months just keep rolling by and the
food keeps rolling in. It is a good time of fellowship for our church
family and the food is always awesome. We&apos;re never &quot;short.&quot;

One of our farmer Faddassers told me about the effects of the harvest
on her weight loss. She gained during harvest and then went right into
Thanksgiving with a few more ounces added. She&apos;s back on schedule now
and I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be hearing about a new weight loss soon. During that
time of year, they eat whenever and whatever they can. The harvest
doesn&apos;t wait.

Each of us has a different challenge in our journey, but it&apos;s amazing
how we all find ways to cope.

You are so special...each one of you...and don&apos;t ever let anyone
convince you otherwise!

 Cookies 
Christmas cookies are wonderful and are a part of Christmas. Many are
oozing calories, but this one isn&apos;t...and it&apos;s still very good. I think
I&apos;ve shared it before, but it&apos;s a good time to do it again.

 FORGOTTEN COOKIES 
2 egg whites
3/4 cup sugar
1 cup saltine cracker crumbs
1/2 cup walnuts

In the morning:
Preheat oven to 375°and grease two cookie sheets
Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Continue beat slowly. Add sugar.
Beat until stiff meringue. Fold in cracker crumbs and walnuts. Drop by
teaspoonful onto greased cookie sheets. Place in oven and turn off
heat. Let them remain in the oven until it cools to room temperature.
Remove from cookie sheets and store in airtight containers.

*Can substitute raisins, chocolate chips, etc. for nuts.

 Keep the doctor away...
 The new crop of apples contains some very delicious
Delicious apples. Eat a red apple. Use it as a dessert or ending to
your meal. Need something a little sweeter? Dip your apple slices in
caramel. The McDonald&apos;s chain has realized the purchasing power of
health-minded mothers and has added apple slices to their kids&apos; meals.
More and more, the fast food places are veering to the side of healthy
eating. And, since this is also Pie Day, why not make an apple pie?

We have taken apples for granted for much too long. In the past, they
were a big part of Christmas treats. Remember the brown bags of hard
Christmas candy, mixed with peanuts-in-the-shell, and one red apple?
That was a standard treat from Santa. You usually got another one after
the Sunday School program. I must have been an abnormal unusual child because I never cared much for the hard candy that my
aunts and uncles liked so well. It would stick to the peanut shells and
make a mess. But brown bags are grab bags and you accept what you get.

Have an apple today and keep the doctor away.

 Got a neat e-mail from Faddasser Gail.  
 My grandson was working a puzzle at the end
of the long table, while the guys had come in for break from working on
the house. Someone asked him if he wasn&apos;t going to finish his
donut. He said &quot;I&apos;m savoring it while I finish this puzzle&quot;. I was so
surprised. I said he must be reading the Fadd Grams.

 Got another e-mail from Faddasser Dee. She said she enjoyed
the attachment to yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram. Didn&apos;t know there was one. I
was going to send it and then kind of forgot about it so I didn&apos;t
mention it in the Fadd Gram. By golly, it was attached. A miracle! If
limbs can be reattached, why not attachments? If you didn&apos;t notice it,
go back to FG 177 and look at it...especially the Monday morning part.
   Tip
for Today 
 Go back over our journey 
If you get some time, go back and read some of the first Fadd

Have something special to eat tonight. Some little snack that you&apos;ve
been craving. Eat it. Chew it slowly. Savor it. Remember moderation.

 Here&apos;s an e-mail I got from one of our Fadd Gram readers.

 ...Today is Throw Out Your Leftovers Day
...Today is Camera Day
...Today is French Toast Day

 What leftovers?
 Throw out my leftovers? What leftovers? As if I wasn&apos;t
suffering enough deprivation without the Events Calendar reminding me
of the fact that I didn&apos;t prepare a Thanksgiving dinner and, so, had no
leftovers. Kind of reminds me of the Little Red Hen story of my youth.
If you don&apos;t do the work, you don&apos;t get to eat. We got to eat...we ate
plenty...but nothing to nibble on the rest of the week. What is better
than cold stuffing with a little cranberry sauce on it? Or a turkey
sandwich? Or stuffing and gravy? Or sweet potatoes? Or just plain
stuffing?

There is an upside to not cooking, besides not having the dirty dishes
or the labor. Although we didn&apos;t have leftovers, I didn&apos;t pack on the
extra pounds I could have put on by grazing; and we saved on
electricity because the refrigerator door wasn&apos;t in perpetual motion.

 The Grapevine 
 Got caught by Faddasser Bob this morning. He stopped into the Credit
Union and in passing, asked how my weigh-in went this morning. The fact
is, I didn&apos;t weigh. I always weigh after I step out of the shower. I
figure the hot water will melt a few ounces off and perhaps wash a
pound or two away. We had a really strong thunderstorm passing over our
house at 5 this morning and everyone knows you shouldn&apos;t shower in a
thunderstorm. I did a sponge bath instead. I&apos;m not going to do that
again. Had a bad (or &quot;badder&quot; than usual) hair day.

Mark Wednesday, December 20th on your calendar. That&apos;s the day of my
retirement party at the Credit Union. We usually have home-made
Christmas cookies and call it Appreciation Day. This year I&apos;m included.
And when they close the doors for the day and it&apos;s all over, perhaps
I&apos;ll sing. (You know who sings when it&apos;s over.)   :-)  

Anyway, join us. I&apos;d like that.

 Winter is just around the corner and if the
temperature drops overnight, the mist we&apos;re seeing now could be
snowflakes or ice in the morning. The snow shovels should be ready, the
snow blowers in shape, and that bag of salt by the garage door. That&apos;s
how you get ready for winter. Your body also needs to prepare for cold
weather. Get out those gloves and caps and winter boots. Although
shivering, by an extreme stretch of the imagination, could be
considered a mild form of exercise, it&apos;s not healthy. Exposure to wind
and cold temps is not good for your body. Wrap up. It takes a little

Got this message from one of our Faddassers.
&quot;This was my first Thanksgiving that I practiced moderation. Thank you,

Can you say the same thing? Because we went to Scott&apos;s for
Thanksgiving, we have no leftovers and that has been a blessing and a
bummer. I love leftovers, but if they&apos;re not here, I can&apos;t eat them.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Have your cake and eat it, too 
Do you know that cake doesn&apos;t have to have three inches of frosting to
be good? You can save a lot of calories and still satisfy your sweet

it...moderate-sized piece, of course.

Today is Flossing Day and although there are a lot of jokes about it,
flossing is really important. I read that gum disease is a serious

can lead to heart attack, stroke and cancer, so floss your way to
better health. Do it daily.

 Twas the night of Thanksgiving, but I just couldn&apos;t sleep.
I tried counting backwards, I tried counting sheep
The leftovers beckoned --- the dark meat and white,
But I fought the temptation with all of my might.

Tossing and turning with anticipation
The thought of a snack became infatuation.
So I raced to the kitchen, flung open the door,
And gazed at the fridge full of goodies galore.
I gobbled up turkey and buttered potatoes,
Pickles and carrots, beans and tomatoes.

I felt myself swelling, so plump and so round,
Till all of a sudden, I rose off the ground !!

I crashed through the ceiling, floated into the sky....
With a mouthful of pudding and a handful of pie,
But I managed to yell as I soared past the trees ...

 Yes, stuffing yourself, as well as the turkey, is an

another helping. Mothers and Grandmothers feed us well. It&apos;s

Mom used to say? &quot;If everyone jumped off a cliff, would you jump off,
too?&quot; No. Have a little of everything...that&apos;s part of
Thanksgiving...but watch the portions. And remember to savor the taste.
Don&apos;t be a turkey. Take your time and enjoy each bite.

 Our yard seems so much bigger. The big flowering crab tree that

That may not sound like such a big deal, but we have no alley so no
backyard access. Now we&apos;d like to replace the patio door with a French

didn&apos;t get caught&quot; and refuse to say anything more. 

 3. Bring
along old recorded football games, pop them in the VCR when Dad&apos;s not
looking. Make sure it is set to the last two minutes of the game. When
he comes into the room, turn off the VCR and turn on the regular TV. 

 4. Bring a date that only talks about
the tragic and abusive conditions known to exist at turkey farms.

During mid-meal turn to mom and say, &quot;See mom, I told you they wouldn&apos;t
notice that the turkey was past the expiration date. You were worried
for
nothing.&quot;

 Well, after looking at the &quot;Today is&quot; list, I see I
can celebrate two &quot;days&quot; in one. It&apos;s absurd to think I&apos;m going
to air my dirty laundry . Hey, I can&apos;t even bend my knees enough

it...I could wash it! Oops! Now you know that my dirty clothes are on

I almost sure I would have come to grips with my bedroom: I&apos;d either
have cleaned it or I would have purchased a land-fill permit.

Kind of like our eating habits, isn&apos;t it! We pig out today and put off

 Calcium, continued...
 As I grow older, I&apos;m becoming more and more aware of
the power of calcium in my diet. My experience with joints that ache
and bones that break is making me realize how important it is to have
enough &quot;bone builder&quot; to steer me away from osteoporosis. Like
everything else that&apos;s healthy for our bodies, we need to make drinking
milk a habit. You need three servings of milk a day. Try a
fruit-n-yogurt for breakfast and a cold glass of milk with at least one
of your meals. The other serving could be in the form of cheese or you
could drink another glass of milk. It doesn&apos;t matter if the milk is
skim, 1%, 2% or whole; chocolate or white; flavored or not...the
calcium is about the same.

Get milk.

 We added another Faddasser to our group today. Welcome to Faddasser
Carol.

The birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese was long and kind of boring for
the adults. The place was packed tighter than a pair of size-smaller
jeans, but the excitement on Mackenzie&apos;s face more than made up for it.
When you have a birthday party there, Chuck comes out and dances with
you, and waves his arms to the singing. His helpers led us in singing
&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and clapping, while the birthday kids blew out the
candles on their individual cakes. I still have the chant from the
helpers going through my head, &quot;I&apos;ll say happy, you say birthday;
happy.....birthday; happy.......birthday.

 Another week... 
Monday seems to be &quot;get a fresh start&quot; day so if you&apos;ve strayed from
the pasture, so to speak, and haven&apos;t been practicing moderation, it&apos;s
time to get back inside the fence and give it another shot. Remember:
You don&apos;t have to give up your favorite food, you just have to not eat
as much.

 Take a Hike...
 Take a hike could mean several things. In this
instance, it means to walk. Walking and hiking are both healthy
exercise and are a very enjoyable pastime for many people.

If the person saying it points to the door and commands, &quot;Take a hike!&quot;
then there&apos;s an all new meaning. It means scram! Get lost! Outta here!
I certainly wouldn&apos;t say that to any of my Faddasser friends, but it
would be appropriate to say it to any junk food you have laying around
the kitchen. Get outta here! I&apos;ll eat fruit or vegetables. Scram! I
want to be healthier.

 Lyle and I are taking off to Eagan tomorrow morning so this is going

evening with a Fadd Gram and a Devotional.

Got a note from Faddasser Sandy who says she&apos;s discovered a new way to
lose weight: the flu that&apos;s going around town. She won&apos;t recommend it,
however. The low appetite that comes with it isn&apos;t exactly the ideal
weight loss plan. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Soft drinks are hard on your enamel 
Just a reminder that cola drinks are full of sugar and phosphoric acid.
These two ingredients work together. The acid softens the enamel and
then the sugar takes over to promote decay. Drink water. It&apos;s much
better for you and a lot cheaper.

 Fast food. Fast for food. Interesting...
 Yes, it&apos;s interesting that today is Fast Food Day and
also Fast for a World Harvest Day...which means Fast for Food Day. It
is a day that is celebrated to express our sympathy for the plight of
the poor, by fasting for a whole day.

Somehow &quot;celebration&quot; and &quot;plight of the poor&quot; do not seem to meld. I
just looked up the word &quot;celebrate&quot; and one of the definitions is &quot;to
observe with ceremonies of respect.&quot; That&apos;s a little better, but not
your first thought when you use the word &quot;celebrate.&quot;

Take a moment to thank God for the abundance of food we have. We are so
spoiled that we have no idea what the other half of the world is going
through. While we strive to take off pounds, they strive to stay alive.

 Almost the weekend again. We&apos;re celebrating Mackenzie&apos;s birthday at

One of my younger friends told me he loves meeting new people. I told
him, &quot;You&apos;re going to love old age then. Everyone you meet is

 Tip for Today 
 Got milk? 
If you haven&apos;t thought about it, do so now. How much calcium are you
getting each day? Do you drink milk? Besides being our primary bone
builder, calcium helps your muscles contract, transfers nerve impulses,
helps your blood to clot and your heart to beat. It&apos;s also the main
ingredient in growing new teeth. More calcium can be found in orange
juice, sardines and cheese.

 Toss the sauce...
 I definitely need to clean out my refrigerator.
Probably you do, too. The &quot;green&quot; food isn&apos;t a problem, but if you have
a jar with just a little teeny bit in the bottom, it&apos;s tempting to
finish it off rather than throw it away. Just like you do with
leftovers. Two scoops left? Not enough to save and too good to toss.
Gulp. Only six olives? Gulp. Only one serving of peach sauce and you
have a family of five? Gulp.

Clean your refrigerator and give yourself permission to toss the &quot;old&quot;
stuff. We&apos;ve been raised to &quot;waste not, want not.&quot; It&apos;s okay to get rid
of leftovers. If you&apos;ve got a dog or cat, great. Otherwise, if it&apos;s
going to go to waste, don&apos;t let it be your waist.

 Got a note from one of our smaller Faddassers. Wouldn&apos;t you know

would have been closer!

GOOD RECYCLER: You fill up the recycle bin every week with cans,

NOT-SO-GOOD: You give the recycle bin to the kids to use as a toboggan.
 
GOOD RECYCLER: You take your used motor oil to the nearest recycling
station or collection facility.
 NOT-SO-GOOD :
You avoid the used-oil problem by never changing your oil. You recycle
engines instead.
 
GOOD RECYCLER: You recycle not only your newspapers, but also your

 NOT-SO-GOOD :
You leave your newspapers in the bathroom stall at work after you&apos;re

 Pickle Trivia 
 
 The pickle got
its name in the 1300s when English-speaking people mispronounced
William Beukelz’name. Beukelz was a Dutch fisherman known for pickling
fish. The phrase &quot;in a
pickle&quot; was coined by none other than William Shakespeare himself. He
writes, in The Tempest , &quot;How cam&apos;st thou in this pickle?&quot; and
&quot;I have been in such a pickle….&quot; Dill pickles are
the most popular, followed by sweet pickles. According to the
U.S. Supreme Court, pickles are technically a &quot;fruit of the vine&quot;, but
they are generally known as a vegetable. And last, but not
least, the children of Israel wandering around in the desert pined for
those cucumbers (pre-pickles) back in Egypt: &quot;We remember the fish,
which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers and the melons, and the
leeks, and the onions, and the garlic...&quot; Num. 11:5 (KJV) .

 Moving slower...
 Moving slower. That&apos;s what I&apos;m doing these days. It&apos;s
an effort to get around. I always said about traveling that I was
&quot;going to go before my knees do.&quot; I may have waited too long. Although
I&apos;ve had some wonderful trips, I was looking forward to retirement and
the chance to travel even more. We&apos;ll have to see what the future
holds, but for now, moving slower does have some good sides.

Most of us are guilty of racing through our meals or eating standing up
or on the run. We finish our breakfast in the car on the way to work.
We grab whatever is quickest for lunch (if we have lunch at all), and
we hurry through our evening meal. Slowing down is good when it comes
to eating. The longer the meal takes, the better chance you have of not
overeating. Chewing your food slowly and taking your time eating will
make you much healthier, and probably thinner.

Hasten slowly.

 Anyone out there have a stray bunk-bed ladder? We really need one.
If I can&apos;t find a &quot;ready-made&quot; one, I&apos;m going to talk to my local
contractor (who is also a Faddasser) and see if he can build one. Quinn
got a loft bed and the ladder is bolted on to the side of the bed with
no angle. It&apos;s quite difficult to go up and down...at least that what
he says, and it certainly looks like it. There is no way on God&apos;s green
earth that I would try it and see. (Nor on His brown earth
either.) That was one of my Mother&apos;s favorite phrases. &quot;There is no way on God&apos;s
green earth that I&apos;m going to let you stay out that late.&quot; Or something
to that effect. I know it always was stated firmly and in regard to
something I wanted to do or had done. &quot;What on God&apos;s green earth gave
you the idea that you could get away with that?&quot;

 Wholesome is as wholesome does

is, check out the list of ingredients on the label.

...This is Sleep Comfort Month

 How comfortable it is...
 Today I celebrated Sleep Comfort Month...really
celebrated. I took a wonderful 2-1/2 hour nap this afternoon. The
afternoon is gone, but not wasted. I feel quite refreshed.

Do you realize that not getting enough sleep can cause you to gain
weight? Here&apos;s a recent news release from USA Today.
 
 Not enough sleep can make you fat. That&apos;s the
conclusion of some groundbreaking research, including two new studies
released Monday. 
 Scientists have
found that sleep deprivation
increases levels of a hunger hormone and decreases levels of a hormone
that makes you feel full. The effects may lead to overeating and weight
gain. 

 It could explain
why so many Americans who are
chronically sleep-deprived also are overweight. And it could be part of
the reason sleepy college students, new parents and shift workers pack
on pounds. 

 Researchers say
getting enough shut-eye might be
a critical component of weight control. And nutritionists one day might
routinely advise dieters to &quot;sleep it off&quot; as well as to cut calories
and increase exercise. 

 &quot;We know the
obesity epidemic is due to
overeating—too big portions, too much rich food and too little
activity —but why do we crave too much of these rich
foods?&quot; says Eve
Van Cauter, a University of Chicago sleep researcher who is the lead
investigator on one of the new studies. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she says, &quot;it&apos;s
because we are sleep-deprived and unable to curb our appetites.&quot; 

 Sleep does
indeed appear to be an important
piece of the weight-control puzzle, says Stanford University sleep
researcher Emmanuel Mignot. --- USA Today

 Crossing the Salad Bar 
Before going through a salad bar, look it over carefully from one end
to the other. Then go back and get a small plate and start filling it.
You&apos;ll have a better idea of what you want. If you load up at the
beginning and then find something you like better farther down the
line, you&apos;ll most likely add it to the plate. If it&apos;s on the plate, no
matter how good your original intentions are, you&apos;ll probably eat it.

 Salad bars: Deal or No Deal? 
A
salad bar can provide you with a very healthy meal in itself. It can
also provide you with more calories than a deluxe hamburger
basket...fries, shake and all. There&apos;s something about the name &quot;Salad
Bar&quot; that conjures up visions of healthy, low-cal foods. If it&apos;s on the
salad bar, you can eat as much as you want, right? You&apos;re doing fine if
you
load up with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and other fresh vegetables.
It&apos;s what you heap on top of the salad, and beside the salad, that
starts heaping up calories: A large ladle of dressing, olives,
croutons, sunflower seeds, cheese, bacon bits and chow mein noodles.
But this is just a &quot;side dish,&quot; so you add a small portions of potato
salad, creamy fruit salad, and macaroni salad. But wait...is that
broccoli-cheese soup? Broccoli is good for you. Have a cup of that,
too. And those neat little packets of crackers. A few of those won&apos;t
hurt. After all, you&apos;re watching your weight. Then when the others pile
their plates high with entrees, you can stay at the table and smugly
say, &quot;Thank you, no. I&apos;m watching my weight.&quot; With a menu like that,
you can watch it soar.

Deal? It depends on what you say &quot;No deal&quot; to.

 Been pretty quiet in the trenches lately. Haven&apos;t heard from any
Faddassers for a few day so I&apos;ll go by the old adage, &quot;No news is good
news.&quot;

I saw Scott&apos;s neighbor hauling out his snowblower this afternoon.
Everyone knows &quot;it&apos;s coming.&quot; I was just a baby when the famous
Armistice Day blizzard occurred. (Until 1954, Armistice Day was 11-11.
That year Congress voted to change it to Veterans Day to honor ALL
veterans, not just those from WWI.)
----------------------
 The Armistice Day Blizzard Ranks #2 on the Minnesota
State Climatology Office Top five weather events of the 20th century.
Ask any Minnesotan born before 1940 and they can tell you where they
were during the Armistice Day Blizzard. The weather was relatively
benign the morning of the November 11, 1940. Many people were outdoors,
taking advantage of the mild holiday weather. The weather forecast that
morning was for colder temperatures and a few flurries. Few people were
prepared for what was to come. The storm started with rain, however the
rain quickly turned to snow. By the time the blizzard tapered off on
the 12th, the Twin Cities had received 16.7 inches of snow,
Collegeville 26.6 inches, and 20-foot drifts were reported near
Willmar. In all 49 Minnesotans lost their lives in this storm, many of
them hunters trapped by the sudden turn of events. ---University of Minnesota Climatology Department.

 Don&apos;t forget... it&apos;s Fri-i-i-i-day!
 Friday closes the door on the work week for many of
us, but it opens another door...the door to temptation. We get off our
schedules and don&apos;t always eat at our regular times. There&apos;s more
opportunity to look for snacks because, supposedly, weekends are meant
for rest. We need to keep on that schedule. Don&apos;t skip meals,
especially breakfast. Eat what you really want, but take smaller
portions and practice moderation. Practice, practice, practice.
Remember that we don&apos;t want to give up the foods we like; we just need
to be aware of the serving size. I was going to say &quot;watch the
serving
size,&quot; but many of us can sit and &quot;watch&quot; ourselves shovel in several
servings, knowing that we&apos;ve super-sized.. So instead, be aware of

 In the thick of it 
When thickening soups, use pureed beans, potatoes, or other

 ...Today is Neon
Sign Day

 EATS...
 That was one of the most common neon signs of
yesteryear. Many of you probably don&apos;t remember, but back in the 40s
and 50s (and maybe earlier, for all I know) neon signs were used by
every business. If you look at the old black-and-white movies, there&apos;s
always a neon HOTEL sign flashing through the ragged lace curtains on
the hotel window as the hero/heroine waits desperately for rescue. A
business place wasn&apos;t officially &quot;open&quot; until the neon OPEN sign was
lit up. As you drove down the street, there was flashing color
everywhere. Today you see very few neon signs, unless you&apos;re in Las
Vegas. And, from what I hear, that&apos;s a neon extravaganza.

What we Faddassers need is a neon sign that flashes when we overeat.
One that says, STOP! or MODERATION! or even just THINK .
It seems like we all need a reminder...and sometimes a pretty physical
one. After several times of rescuing me with a can of gasoline after
I&apos;d driven on fumes until it was too late, Lyle told me that since I
couldn&apos;t remember to read the gas gauge, he was going to set it up so a
rock fell on my head when the tank was down to a quarter. He never did
it, though..just like we never get around to really &quot;stopping&quot; or
&quot;moderating.&quot; Read the signs (fat belly, shortness of breath,
tight
waistband) and do something about it! There&apos;s no better time than
right now.

 What a difference a day makes. Today was a great day. I got to sleep

green just as I approached the intersection on my way to work, and the

with the grandchildren this afternoon and when Lyle came home, I was
smiling instead of in tears. I think this retirement deal is going to
work out well...quite well, indeed. (Haven&apos;t retired yet, but I had
this afternoon and tomorrow off so it&apos;s kind of a preview.)

 Serving sizes for the health of it 
We need to keep watching the sizes of our servings if we&apos;re going to
practice moderation. What seems like a small serving in the bowl, could
turn out to be two servings when measured. We each have different
nutritional needs, depending upon how much energy we use up. To help
you out, here are a few portions that you can eyeball to get close.
1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice....................small computer mouse
1 cup of dry cereal...................................a baseball
1/2 cup cooked vegetables.......................small computer mouse
1/2 cup fruit.............................................small

Hate to Cook Day

 It was a terrible day...
 If nothing else reinforced my decision to retire,
today did. You&apos;d think the next day would be stress-free, but not so.
It was a day from...well, it was a bad day. We were short of staff,
things kept going wrong, and to top it all off, the inside temp was 80
degrees with no air movement. And, of course, the day I needed to get
out on time so that I could get air, turned out to be a day that ran
late and never seemed to end. Well, I made it through the day without
seriously injuring anyone, but a few more days in stuffy heat and I
won&apos;t be responsible for my actions.

We do need to be responsible for our actions. No one else can lose our
weight for us. It&apos;s something we have to do ourselves and to do that
you have to make a sincere commitment to try.Being a Faddasser

 One of my Fadd friends said that when feelings take over her day, in
any form, she tells &quot;the feelings&quot; to &quot;Sit down and shut up.&quot; She
thinks it would work for hunger, too, and to those of you who find the
phrase offensive, you can tell the feelings to go home...that
they&apos;re
not welcome there. Or, perhaps, make those feelings take a time out in
the corner. And she added, &quot;When all else fails, humor works.&quot; 
 
 Tip
for Today 
 Savor the flavor 
Earlier in our program I encouraged you to savor the taste of the food
and not to shove it down your throats with little or no chewing
involved. Savoring the flavor adds a new dimension to your eating
enjoyment and it takes longer to eat so you&apos;re less likely to eat as
much. Tomorrow...just for tomorrow...try savoring every bite.

Election Day
...This is Nurse Practitioner Week
...Today is Bittersweet Chocolate with Almonds Day (Too late for most of us to celebrate unless
you have a private stash.) 

 It was time...
 Today I handed in my resignation at the Credit Union.
I will be retired by the end of the year. It&apos;s hard to realize in my
mind that it&apos;s time to retire, but my body has known it for a long
time. My body finally convinced my mind and I will soon be out of the
work force. Where does time go? But that&apos;s another story.

Do you realize that we&apos;ve been faddassing for five months already? The
first months we went like a house afire and ate healthy and
&quot;moderated.&quot; Now it seems like the &quot;house afire&quot; has diminished to
glowing embers, somewhere in the ashes. Remember
my plans to be so thin by Christmas? That&apos;s six weeks away and I&apos;m not
very close. Let&apos;s get that fire going
again. What can I do to get you motivated? Let me know. Or even better,
what can YOU do to get me motivated? Help!

 I&apos;m anxious to follow the new path to retirement as I continue on my
life&apos;s journey. I&apos;m just retiring from paid work...not retiring from
work. I&apos;d like to do some volunteer work that I was never able to
do
working full-time.

I started writing the Fadd Gram tonight and then Lyle came home, so we
went to cast our ballots. As I was standing in line, a friend and I
were talking about how many people had been there. She said there were
some from her work place who came at noon and got right in and out. I
told her that I&apos;d thought about voting at noon, but didn&apos;t want to let
a thing like &quot;freedom&quot; interfere with my lunch. (Just joking. I&apos;m as
patriotic as the next person.) She only has a half hour at noon so she
laughed and said, &quot;Isn&apos;t that the truth.&quot; Seriously, I hope you took
the time to vote today. A lot of lives have been sacrificed just so we
could do that very thing.

 ...Today is the
Halfway Point of Autumn
...Today is Peanut Butter Lover&apos;s Day
...Today is I Love Nachos Day
...Today is Saxophone Day

 Do you butter up?
 There are so many really unimportant things that
people argue about... like which way to put the toilet paper on the
holder. With all the problems in today&apos;s life, who cares which way the
paper comes off the roll? Just be thankful you&apos;re not out in the jungle
looking for leaves.

Peanut Butter Lover&apos;s Day made me think of a young couple who are going
to be married soon. The girl asked me, &quot;When you have peanut butter
toast, do you put butter on your toast and then peanut butter?&quot; I said
that I did. Her fiance said, &quot;That&apos;s crazy. Why would you put butter
on, when you&apos;re going to put peanut butter on?&quot; I hope that&apos;s the worst
problem they have in their life together.

But it brings up another thought. Do you really need butter on
your sandwiches? Do you really need butter under the jelly?
You&apos;d save a lot of calories by not buttering the bread. And another
plus...if you drop it, you won&apos;t have to worry about if it will land
with the butter side up!   :-)  Most of the time, you&apos;ll hardly notice that the butter is missing. It&apos;s
another one of our fatty habits that we could practice moderation on.

 The Grapevine 
 My grandson was sick and I wasn&apos;t feeling well either, so we stayed
home together today. When television was called a vast wasteland, they
knew what they were talking about. This afternoon we watched &quot;Family
Feud&quot; on the Game Show Network and I couldn&apos;t believe some of the
answers. There was a family of cute sisters from Texas who came up with
a few real doozies for answers. One of the questions was: &quot;Name
something that people argue over.&quot; The other family guessed four of the
answers, which were everyday things, like marriage, but they struck out
without guessing the number one answer. The Texas girls then put their
little heads together and came up with &quot;nuclear energy.&quot; Needless to
say, that wasn&apos;t the answer. It was &quot;money.&quot; Of course, I should talk
about their intellect. I actually spent an hour watching the show.

Got a message from one of our new Faddassers, who said, &quot; Thanks for the daily reminders. I was sinking and
spreading fast.&quot; The spreading fits right in with our
butter
message. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Fruit spread 
There are some very tasty fruit spreads out there that contain little
or no sugar and are, basically, all fruit. That&apos;s the brand name of one
of the lines. We used to call it jam, but now it&apos;s a spread. Fruit
spreads are good on toast or English muffins and also make a good
topping for pudding or ice cream. I&apos;ve also used apricot spread on pork
chops and chicken.

 It&apos;s a beautiful day in the
neighborhood...
 After the chilling winds and cold temperatures of the
past couple weeks, today&apos;s weather was virtually a breath of fresh air.
It was a beautiful day in the neighborhood. How many of you watched Mr.
Rogers when you were young? If you didn&apos;t, your children probably did.
It was always a beautiful day in his neighborhood. No matter how
upsetting your day was, when Mr. Rogers opened the door and stepped
inside, the whole world was suddenly calmer. It
was a soothing program. He never hurried. He never raised his voice.
And he could talk and tie his shoe laces at the same time.

He had a routine that was the same day after day. You could depend upon
it. He opened the door, welcomed you, changed his jacket to a sweater,
and then took off his street shoes and put on his tennis shoes. Part of the routine was visiting or introducing something new. Mr.
Rogers was an anchor to
thousands of children who never knew what was going to happen in their
disruptive personal lives.

I think that we, as Faddassers, could do well to imitate Mr. Rogers.
Develop a routine of eating at the same time every day. Don&apos;t hurry.
Don&apos;t raise your voice at the table, and, occasionally, introduce
something new to your menu.
 
 The Grapevine 
 It was a real test for the Faddassers at the Evangelical Church
today. Pot Luck Sunday. Our tables were full of hot dishes and salads.
I made a pumpkin pie dessert because it was my turn to bring dessert.
Most of you know what a &quot;hot dish&quot; is, but go to another region of the
country and they&apos;re called casseroles. We use the word &quot;dish&quot; a lot in
Minnesota. Besides hot dishes, we bring &quot;a dish to pass,&quot; and we &quot;bring
your own dishes.&quot; We never say anything about food...just dishes. The
nice thing about Minnesota is that we all know what a &quot;dish to pass&quot; is
and whatever we bring will be bountiful.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Walk the walk 
It&apos;s a good time of the year to begin a walking program. The weather is
cool so walking is comfortable. There are no mosquitoes and the air
fresh. Just 15 minutes a day can make a huge difference to your heart
health. If you find a walking buddy, you can not only walk the walk,
but you can talk the talk.

 ...Today is Candy
Day
...Today is King Tut Day

 What did your mummy tell you?
 What did my mummy tell me? Like every other mother in
America at that time, she told me to &quot;Clean your plate.&quot; My childhood
occurred during and shortly after World War II, and with the rationing
of food and supplies, we were told to get the last drop out of
everything. That was also the philosophy of the school system and, in
1946 when I was in 1st grade, I was introduced to dried eggs. They were
supposed to be &quot;scrambled,&quot; but there was no resemblance to the real
thing. I gagged on every bite and since we had to clean our plates
before we could leave the table, on egg days I never got any recess
time. The schools were using the surplus military food left over from
the WWII. How we ever won the war after feeding those atrocious eggs to
our soldiers is something I will never understand.

Times have changed and we&apos;re no longer rationing food. We&apos;ve become a
nation of obesity instead. There&apos;s plenty of everything...except
exercise. It&apos;s still not good to waste food, but it is no longer
mandatory to clean your plate. If you make the right decisions and have
moderate servings, a clean plate won&apos;t be a problem and it certainly
won&apos;t send your scale spinning.

 The Grapevine 
 Another test tomorrow. We have pot luck at church and they&apos;re
usually very tempting. So will I pass the test? Will I practice
moderation? I hope so. There will be a lot of Faddassers there watching
each other so we&apos;ll see if guilt works to limit serving size.

I just checked the event calendar again and noticed that it is Giant
Omelette Celebration in Louisiana today. Didn&apos;t notice that until after
I did my &quot;dried eggs&quot; story. Even after 60 years, associating the word
&quot;giant&quot; with those so-called omelettes gives me goose bumps.

...Today is Tunnel Day
...Today is Housewife&apos;s Day

 The end of the tunnel...
 Tunnel vision isn&apos;t the best way
to look at life. Narrow-mindedness is not a positive addition to
thinking, but in the case of losing weight, sometimes that&apos;s just what
you need: tunnel vision. You need to focus on the light at the end of
the tunnel; the light that will emphasize how well you look; how thin
you are. It&apos;s easy to get lost in peripheral perception and stray away
from the goal.

For awhile, at least, focus on losing weight. There&apos;s an old hymn
called &quot;Life&apos;s Railway to Heaven.&quot; One of the lines goes something like
this: &quot;Watch the curves, the hills, the trestles; never falter, never
fail. Keep your hand upon the throttle and your eye upon the
rail.&quot; We
need to watch the detours that tempt us on a daily basis and focus on
the end of the tunnel.
 

 The Grapevine 
 This from our
newest Faddasser: With three preschoolers serenading me
at dinnertime, I found the perfect way to determine portion size: eat
like a preschooler. They seem to manage quite well. 
   Scales are
intimidating to me. With the birth of my last child, I topped 230
pounds, and my body
chose 210 as it&apos;s favorite number. At medical appointments, I would tell the nurses, &quot;You
can keep &apos;that&apos; to yourself. &quot; I&apos;ll let you know when the
scale gets
taken out of the closet. I am not that gutsy right now.   Does anyone find
that seeing the &quot;number&quot;
is just a really big let-down after working so hard to reduce the
&quot;number&quot;? I do. Forget those scary movies, I am terrified of
stepping
on the scale. :-) 
 
 One solution: I
choose a favorite style of jeans that are one or two sizes smaller, hang them in my closet, and
try
them on every now and then. It works for me. This keeps me away
from
the fast food...sometimes.   I find that the
more I think about not eating, the more my &quot;body&quot; craves more. The fasting mechanism
must
trigger something that says, &quot;Oh, no, she&apos;s gonna starve me, have two
more servings-; it&apos;s now or never....&quot;     I do BETTER if I
keep my MIND busy and
my HANDS busy. The doctor and nurses would tell me to keep moving, and
to
REALLY work hard...work up a sweat. The doctor told me that
&quot;folding
clothes and matching socks&quot; was no longer an exercise program&quot;. Ouch!   So....those are my
thoughts about food, Jean. Feel free to use it or delete
it. This is
a great forum! 
 Tip for Today 
 Sandwiches don&apos;t need to be two-faced 
That&apos;s right. You can enjoy an open-faced sandwich just as much as one
with two slices of bread. It often takes a little more dexterity to eat
it, but the flavor is there, and by setting aside the top half of the
bun (usually the larger part) or the top slice, you have cut your
calories down by quite a bit. Next time you have a hamburger, take the
top half of the bun and get rid of it . If you just take it off
and eat the rest of the sandwich, you&apos;ll end up eating the top as
dessert. This is the voice of experience speaking. Good intentions go
out the window when you see good food being &quot;wasted.&quot; By eating it, you
have now &quot;waisted&quot; it instead.

It really bugs me that spelling has changed since I learned. In my day,

Deviled eggs are very good and so easy to make. The thing is, we forget

 There&apos;s more than just a little nip in the air...the
cold weather has progressed from a gentle nibble to a full-fledged
bite. Like Pollyanna, you can find a good side to the frigid temps, if
you really try. For instance, did you know that you can burn calories
by shivering? That&apos;s what some studies have shown. Your muscles
&quot;exercise&quot; without any help from you. All you have to do is experience
the discomfort. It sounds easy, but it might not be everyone&apos;s exercise
of choice. For instance, my husband, the man who dips one toe at a time
into a heated swimming pool, might find this exercise program almost
impossible, but the old boy can really shiver so he&apos;d be good at it.

If you&apos;re going to freeze something, make it something like fruit cups.
They&apos;re nutritious and a great way to start the day. Freezing
entrees
can be a big help, too, if you freeze them in reasonable amounts.
There&apos;s usually enough leftovers for at least one serving. Instead of
scraping the bowl and licking the spoon * , you can put together a
tasty little meal and pop it in the freezer. Then when you&apos;re very
hungry and short of time, you can take one out and be eating before you
start combing the kitchen for snacks.

 * I&apos;m pretty sure there was a law during the 40s and 50s that
the person who cleared the table had to eat the leftovers when they
scraped the bowl. Something like the Clean Plate Club, but it was
called the Clean Bowl Club instead .
At least it was practiced in our home and the homes of my relatives.

 This has to be a record. Last night I spent an hour and 45 minutes
on the phone trying to get Lyle&apos;s minutes transferred from one TracFone

had expired. October 31, 2006 popped up as the date his service ended.
When I tried to tell &quot;Cortez&quot; that we wouldn&apos;t be able to use the 840
minutes because the service time was today&apos;s date, he suggested that I
buy some more so I could extend the time. I told him that we had
service until May 10, 2007, when he and I started the telephone
marathon. As the smoke cleared from the ear piece on his headset, he
told me I would have to call again tomorrow because they were
getting
ready to close.

If we used a cell phone a lot, I would drive over our TracFones with
the car...several times. Episode II continues tonight as I try to talk

 Mix the following ingredients together in a large bowl .
2 small cartons of frozen strawberries
    or one bag of mixed berries (thawed)
1 can crushed pineapple and juice
3 bananas, sliced or cubed
1 6-oz. can of frozen orange juice
1 6-oz. can of frozen lemonade
3 cups of water
2/3 cup sugar
Arrange 5-oz paper cups in a cake pan.Take a ladle and spoon the
mixture into the paper cups. Cover the pan with Saran wrap and put in
the freezer, making sure it&apos;s level. Take out of the freezer about half
an hour before serving. You can also run warm water on the outside of
the paper cup so the contents slide out into a glass. As it thaws, add
some 7-up for a refreshing drink.

 Today&apos;s
joke celebrates Nutty Pecan Day. 

 On
the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just
inside the cemetery fence. One day two
boys filled up a bucket with pecans and sat down by the tree, out of
sight, and began dividing the nuts.

 &quot;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,&quot; said one boy.
Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down
to
investigate. Sure enough, he heard, &quot;One for you, one for me. One for
you, one for me.&quot;   He
just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just
around the bend, he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. 
 
&quot;Come here quick,&quot; said the boy, &quot;you won&apos;t believe what I heard! Satan
and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.&quot; 

 The man said, &quot;Beat it kid!
Can&apos;t you see it&apos;s hard for me to walk?&quot; When the boy insisted though,
the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they
heard, &quot;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.&quot;

The old man whispered, &quot;Boy, you&apos;ve been tellin&apos; me the truth. Let&apos;s
see if we can see the Lord.&quot;

Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable
to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars
of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, &quot;One for you, one for me. That&apos;s all. Now let&apos;s go
get those nuts by the fence and we&apos;ll be done.&quot;

They say the old man made it back to town a full five minutes ahead of
the kid on the bike.

 So...how did today go?
 Things went pretty well for me. How about you? Thank
goodness no one brought Halloween candy to work. I have my handy-dandy
dish of coins ready, but since we don&apos;t have the front light on, I
doubt if we&apos;ll have any trick-or-treaters...other than the
grandchildren, who would never let the lack of a porch light stop them.
Having been around Grandma, they know that &quot;the light may not always be
on, but Grandma&apos;s always home.&quot; Coins work better than candy. Never
been desperate enough to eat them, but that doesn&apos;t include the
chocolate one. There were a lot of people in the grocery store tonight
buying treats. I heard one guy say, &quot;If we buy the candy early, there&apos;s
nothing left come Halloween.&quot; Been there; done that.

How many times did the light go on for you today? The refrigerator
light. The kitchen light. The bathroom light. Yes, there have been
times when I sneaked candy into the bathroom so no one would see me eat
it. I have no shame. It&apos;s pretty obvious that I haven&apos;t been the first
one to push myself away from the table.

 Roasting pumpkin seeds from AllRecipes.com 
 
Roasted
pumpkin seeds have a nutty flavor and are packed with protein and
fiber. Pumpkin seeds are delicious toasted and salted, but they&apos;re
even
better flavored with sweet and savory spices.

How to Roast Pumpkin Seeds

 Rinse
pumpkin seeds under cold water and pick out the pulp and strings. (This
is easiest just after you’ve removed the seeds from the pumpkin, before
the pulp has dried.) Place the pumpkin seeds in a single layer
on an oiled baking sheet, stirring to coat. If you prefer, omit the oil
and coat with non-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt and bake at 325 degrees F. until toasted,
about 25 minutes, checking and stirring after 10 minutes. Let cool and store in an air-tight container. 

 Why carve pumpkins? 

 
The
story of the Jack o’Lantern comes from Irish folklore. Jack was a
crafty farmer who tricked the Devil into climbing a tall tree. When the
Devil reached the highest branch, Jack carved a large cross in the
trunk, making it impossible for the Devil to climb down. In exchange
for help getting out of the tree, the Devil promised never to tempt
Jack with evil again. When Jack died, he was turned away from Heaven
for his sins and turned away from Hell because of his trickery.
Condemned to wander the Earth without rest, Jack carved out one of his
turnips, took an ember from the devil, and used it for a lantern to
light his way. He became known as“Jack of the Lantern.

 The wind doth blow...
 The wind tonight is so strong that it is blowing
everything and everyone around. I&apos;m no lightweight, yet it started
shoving me away from the car. It was almost like swimming against a

there
was debris all over the lawn. Picked it all up so I got my exercise in

I&apos;ve been a little windy myself and, as one of our Faddassers asked,
&quot;Are you practicing what you&apos;re preaching?&quot;

My answer was, &quot;Kind of.&quot;

There are several of us on a plateau and we&apos;ve been lounging there for
the past few months. We need to get out of the gray area and back into
business. We started on a Tuesday in the beginning, so tomorrow I&apos;m going to restart my original plan and get going.
I challenge you to get a piece of paper, a notebook, or a chisel and
stone...something to keep track of what you&apos;re eating. Then write down
every bite. You don&apos;t have to have exact measurements. You know how big
the helpings are. Journal your eating for one week and by the end of
the week, you&apos;ll either have lost weight or you&apos;ll know the reasons why.

I double-dog dare you.

 The Grapevine 
 Had quite an argument going this morning. The kids and I went to
Java River for muffins and juice and on our table was a little tent
sign for the Congo Hog Roast. Mackenzie is in kindergarten and is
learning to read. She studied the sign and then asked, &quot;What is eleven
am?&quot;

Quinn scoffed at her and said, &quot;It&apos;s not am...it&apos;s A - M.&quot; 

She still thought she was right (a child after my own heart), so I
explained that AM meant morning. Then she got really upset and said,
&quot;They got it all mixed up! Morning starts with an &quot;M&quot; so it should be
MA.&quot;

We&apos;d still be arguing, but I sent them up to pay the bill.

 ...Today is the
end of Daylight Savings
Time for this year
...Today is the Internet&apos;s Birthday

 It was a great day...
 This has been a great day. This afternoon the young
people of our church went to our neighboring town of Granite Falls to
take advantage of their wonderful Community Center. What an awesome
place! Something for everyone. I didn&apos;t bring my swim suit along
because once I hit the beach, Green Peace starts circling. But I wish I
had...environmental issues or not. I&apos;ve always said that not wearing
shorts, halter tops, and swim suits is my contribution to beautifying
America.

The Kilowatt Center almost changed my mind. There is a lap pool, a 3-ft
deep side pool with a big, twisty slide, a wonderful kiddie pool with a
mushroom waterfall, and a big hot tub in the corner...one that really
bubbles. The kids had a wonderful time and there was even more to come.
We went back to the Buchanan&apos;s farm for a bonfire and hot dogs and what
should we find there, but a haunted house. Their two foreign exchange
students, Emily from Australia and Albert from Hungary, had gotten
together with friends and made the old summer kitchen into a haunted
house. It was really neat.

This weekend we celebrate Make a Difference Day and I want to let Amy
and David Buchanan know just how big a difference they are making in
the lives of our young people. There are many kids who do not go to our
church, but don&apos;t miss the Sunday night King&apos;s Kids. They&apos;ve had pizza
parties, bowling parties, sledding parties and swimming parties. That&apos;s
in addition to the weekly leadership that Amy does. So thanks a lot. We
appreciate you.

Making a difference doesn&apos;t have to be a big thing. Sometimes just a
smile, a note, or a hug can push the clouds away from an otherwise
dreary life. We never know what suffering is going on behind the faces
that we meet. Make a difference.

 Phew! That almost sounded like it should be my devotional!

Got a little Daylight Savings Time story to pass on. Faddasser Steve
has an alarm clock in his bedroom that automatically resets itself when
the time changes in the spring and fall. This morning he woke up,
looked at the alarm clock and saw that it was five o&apos;clock and decided
to get up and get something done. A little later he was in the kitchen
and, glancing at the kitchen clock, noticed that it was already 6:45.
My gosh, he wondered, where did the time go? He&apos;s always a little bit
on the fuzzy side, but this one really confused him. Since he had to
call his parents about something else, he thought he&apos;d check with them.
He dialed and the phone rang and rang and rang. No answer, so he hung
up, thinking they must be outside. A little later, the phone rang and
it was his Dad, asking if he&apos;d called. Steve said that yes he had, but
figured since they hadn&apos;t answered, they must be outside. His father
did not want to say to his firstborn,&quot;Are you nuts?&quot; Instead he
explained that since it was not even 6 AM, they had been sound asleep.
Hopefully, Steve will figure it out before the last Sunday in April.

The thing I can&apos;t quite understand is the people who overslept and were
late for church this morning. That&apos;s not what usually happens when we
&quot;fall back.&quot;

 Boiled Dressing for Cole Slaw 
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup vinegar
1 teaspoon mustard seed or celery seed,
  or a half teaspoon of each
1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
Combine all the ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Boil
about one minute. Cool and put on salad or store in a small jar. Makes

 Another
episode of Calories That Don&apos;t Count 
I f you have a drink in your right hand, anything eaten with the
other hand has no calories. The principle at work here is this. There&apos;s
the electronic field: a wet glass in one hand forms a negative charge
to reverse the polarity of the calories attracted to the other hand.
It&apos;s not known exactly how this works, but it&apos;s reversible if you&apos;re
left-handed.

Chocolate Day

 Celebrate Chocolate...
 That&apos;s what I&apos;m doing and it&apos;s working well. The new
fudgesicles aren&apos;t as tasty. They don&apos;t have the creamy, milk chocolate
taste that the real ones do. But they&apos;re satisfactory and I don&apos;t eat
as many and since they&apos;re half the calories, I think I&apos;ve come up with
a livable solution.

Whether it&apos;s smoking or eating, it takes some compromise. I know people
who want to quit smoking and have gone to menthol cigarettes because
they don&apos;t like them. They satisfy their nicotine need, but don&apos;t
overdue it.

If you have a food that is hard to resist, look around for a healthy
substitute. It&apos;s a big step on the way to gorgeous.

 It&apos;s Saturday night...barely...it&apos;s 5:07 PM... and I&apos;m already
thinking about bedtime. Plus we set the clocks back an hour tonight so
if I stay awake until 8 PM, it will be like going to bed at 7. My, how times do change. (Little pun there.) The grandchildren hate to go to bed early and
Grandma can&apos;t wait. We never picked the babysitter up until 8 in the
old days.

With the time change, how many people do you think will be an hour
early for church services tomorrow? Falling back isn&apos;t so difficult. It
may be inconvenient to be early, but at least you&apos;re there. In the
Spring, it&apos;s a whole different story. That hour seems like a day.

 Snuggle up a little closer...
 As the weather gets colder, it becomes more difficult
to get your body to move outside to walk or exercise. It&apos;s the kind of
weather where you like to curl up in a big chair and snuggle down into
a blanket. With the World Series and football along with that, it
sometimes becomes a real workout to even get up from the chair to get a
snack. It&apos;s that kind of weather that creates couch potatoes.

There are a lot of good exercise videos out there. Pop one in and

 Well, I did it. The Schwan&apos;s man was here today and I bought some
fudgesicles. I just have to learn moderation because I don&apos;t want to
live my life without them. I compromised though. I bought the diet
ones, which aren&apos;t quite as good so I shouldn&apos;t eat as many at a time,
and they are only half the calories. The real fudgesicles have
110 calories; these have 50. That&apos;s quite a difference when you
consider that there&apos;s 24 in a box. I&apos;m going to do it. Love conquers
all and I love fudgesicles so I need to either learn to eat just one or

 ...Today is Mule
Day

 Stubborn as what?
 Mules certainly have a reputation for being stubborn,
but then there are many humans who have the same trait. In fact, they&apos;d
make mules look like gentle lambs. My almost-six-year-old granddaughter
is one of them. She crosses her arms and gives you a glare, but,
thankfully, Grandma can outlast her. And she doesn&apos;t hurry. When I told
her the other day to hurry up and get dressed, she turned her little
nose up in the air and said, &quot;I&apos;ll tell you just what I told my
brother: the more you yell, the slower I&apos;m going to go.&quot; (I think she
considers being told to do something as &quot;yelling.&quot;)

Back in the 50s there was a very popular movie called &quot;Scudda Hoo
Scudda Hay!&quot; If you look on the theatre marquee in the town square in Back
to the Future , you&apos;ll see that it was the main feature. It was
about a team of mules with big hearts and a stubborn farmer with no
heart. Walter Brennan is one of the good guys. If you look quickly,
you&apos;ll also see Marilyn Monroe at the swimming hole. It was one of her
first parts.

If you&apos;re going to be stubborn, make it worthwhile. Be stubborn about
eating healthy. Be stubborn about exercising. Be stubborn about
moderation. Being stubborn can be a positive thing if you make it that
way.

A preacher went to his church office on Monday morning and discovered a
dead mule in the church yard so he called the police. 
 Since
there did not appear to be any foul play, the police referred the
preacher to the health department. They said since there was no health
threat, that he should call the sanitation department. 

 The
sanitation manager said he could not pick up the mule without
authorization from the mayor. 

 Now
the preacher knew the mayor and was not to eager to call him. The mayor
had a bad temper and was generally hard to deal with, but the preacher
called him anyway. 

 The
mayor did not disappoint. He immediately began to rant and rave at the
pastor and finally said, &quot;Why did you call me anyway? Isn&apos;t it your job
to bury the dead?&quot; 

 The
preacher paused for a brief prayer and asked the Lord to direct his
response. He was led to say, &quot;Yes, Mayor, it is my job to bury the
dead, but I always like to notify the next of kin first!&quot;

 Do it yourself...
 That&apos;s what today is: Do It Yourself Day. When it
comes to getting thinner, that&apos;s exactly what it boils down to. You
have to do it yourself. No one else can do it for you. Of course, a
personal chef, a personal trainer, and tons of money for fresh seafood,
makes the course a little easier, but you&apos;re still the one who is
ultimately responsible. I suppose you could consider liposuction and
then someone else would be removing your fat, but for reality&apos;s sake,
it&apos;s up to you.

Have you slipped into some of your old eating habits? It&apos;s time to get

 I&apos;ve been like a drunken engineer...steered myself
right off the rails...but I&apos;m back on track and heading forward. It was
a wonderful weekend and I ate what I wanted to and enjoyed every bite.
Now it&apos;s time to get back to business. Actually, I really didn&apos;t do
anything real extravagant, as far as overeating. When I got
&quot;uncomfortably full,&quot; I stopped. And, if you can believe this, I passed
up cheesecake for dessert. And it wasn&apos;t a sliver. It was about an
eighth of the cheesecake. When I saw that big slice of gorgeous
cheesecake, I almost caved, but held my ground. Maybe I&apos;ll have to
change from fudgesicles to cheesecake. I seem to have more willpower.
Of course, if I was eating fudgesicles in front of eight people, I
probably would have a little more restraint.

If you&apos;ve strayed off your eating plan this weekend, forget about it
and get on with your journey. A little extra food isn&apos;t going to change

 The best part of the weekend was meeting the family of my friend
Sandy. We surprised her big-time. She and her daughter, Jennifer, and I
celebrated Sandy&apos;s 65th birthday. We spent the afternoon shopping in
Stillwater and then went to the Saint Paul Hotel, where we had
reservations for Saturday night. Jennifer decided to spend the evening
with us, but not the night. When we went across the street to Kincaid&apos;s
for dinner, the waiter led us to a table for 9. Sandy, looking
confused, said, &quot;Why would they seat the three of us at a large table
like this?&quot; Jennifer just laughed and said, &quot;Maybe because there are
more guests coming.&quot; And so there were. All three of her children and
their spouses/fiances were there, as well as her oldest and youngest
grandchildren.

I had a wonderful time matching faces to all the names that I&apos;ve heard
about through the past several years. For you know, it would be
impossible for two proud mothers to talk as often as we do without
mentioning our children! I&apos;d traveled with Jennifer and her daughter,
Katie, and knew daughter Polly from the baggage claim area at the
airport. She seems to have been the official airport picker-upper for
her Mom. Turns out Katie looks just like her dad, John. Polly&apos;s fiance
builds street rods and that&apos;s certainly right up our alley. Son Jeff
has a micro-brewery and a &quot;micro-baby.&quot; Darby is only two months old.
Darby&apos;s mom, Kathy, reminded me of my &quot;granddaughter&quot; Jenny. All in
all, every single family member had interesting things happening in
their lives and it&apos;s an evening I won&apos;t forget.

The party broke up about 8 o&apos;clock and the kids kind of snickered at
us, because we were topping the evening off by putting a jigsaw puzzle
together back in the hotel room. About 10 we had the puzzle together
and went to the lobby to people-watch and have a night cap. There was a
big wedding in the hotel so there was a lot of people-traffic passing
through the lobby.

Long story. Great weekend. Thank you, Jennifer, for putting it
together. And thank you to the Williamson kids for the warm reception.

 You can, can do it...
 The &quot;Days&quot; this week write their own little story. Boost
your brain by watching a squirrel . Note that they don&apos;t eat
everything they get their little paws on...they store most of it for
long, cold, winter days. Thursday, take the time to l ook back on
your life . For the past four months, we Faddassers have been
improving our lives. We&apos;ve already celebrated Change Your Life Day and we keep on celebrating it on a daily basis. If this sounds like I&apos;m babbling , it&apos;s because I am. It&apos;s one of the ways I communicate
best. Remember that you can can do it...you can eat
healthy foods and you can get by on one helping.

Got a message from Faddasser Georgette about my fudgesicle problem.
  Hee
Hee! Made me think of you anyway...

This week&apos;s theme: words about books.

fascicle (FAS-i-kuhl) noun

  1. Part of a book published in installments. For example,
     the Oxford English Dictionary was
published in fascicles.

  2. A bundle. For example, a bundle of nerve or muscle
fibers, 
      or a
bundle of leaves. 
-----------------------------
 Installments, huh? Yes, my fudgesicles
come in installments of 24, but I&apos;ve always been a fast &quot;reader&quot; so I
can get through a LOT of installments in an evening. And that&apos;s &quot;a
bundle&quot; of fudgesicles. The Schwan&apos;s man comes this week and I&apos;ll be
gone so I should be able to stay clean for another two weeks.

 X is for X-emption 
 You&apos;ll be
exempt from Fadd Grams for the next three days. I&apos;m
taking a few days off, so this is a multi-day Fadd Gram. If you get
desperate, you can always go back and read the early Fadd Grams on http://www.hoidal.com/fadd_index.html 

It&apos;s MEA weekend so I&apos;m going to be a &quot;traveling nanny&quot; and take the
Monte grandchildren down to Eagan to visit their city cousins.

 There were four country churches in a
small Delaware town: The
Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, and the
Catholic Church. Each church was overrun with pesky squirrels. 

 One day the Presbyterian Church called
a meeting to decide what to
do about the squirrels. After much prayer and consideration, they
determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they
shouldn’t interfere with God’s divine will. 

 In the Baptist Church the squirrels had
taken up habitation in the
baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the
baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow
and there were twice as many there the next week. 

 The Catholic group got together and
decided that they were not in a
position to harm any of God’s creation. So, they humanely trapped the
squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days
later, the squirrels were back. 

 But the Methodist Church came up with
the best and most effective
solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of
the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.

 Go to this site to read
one of my favorite poems, The Creation by James Weldon Johnson.
I&apos;ve been reading it for 50 years and it still makes me smile.
 
 Sleep on it and call me in the morning...
 Yesterday the new loft bed was not okay. Today, it&apos;s
great. A night&apos;s sleep and a good bed can give you a whole new
perspective. (If you don&apos;t know about the loft bed, read the Fadd Grams
from the last two days.)

Sleep is a wonderful thing. When we&apos;re young, we pout because we have
to take a nap. When we&apos;re old, we&apos;d give a lot to lay down for an
afternoon snooze. Sleeping can keep you healthier, and when you&apos;re less
stressed, the impulse to snack isn&apos;t as great. According to the charts,
not many of us get the required daily limit of sleep. Not enough sleep
can make us less efficient, more irritable and can cause confusion.
Give your body a treat. Go to bed early and get a good night&apos;s rest and
then see what tomorrow brings. 

 The Grapevine 
 Some of you got two Fadd Grams yesterday and some of you got none.
For some reason, I got all the messages back (twice) that were
@yahoo.com. The DSN message said the message had been temporarily
deferred. That was at 11:30 AM and again at 5 PM. If that&apos;s your
address and you&apos;d like to read the Fadd Grams, they&apos;re online.

One of our Faddassers turned 65 yesterday. I was going to put it in the
Grapevine and forgot all about it. So Happy Birthday! Welcome to the
world of Senior Citizen Discounts!

Another of our Faddassers, who has been 65 for quite some time, should
be celebrating Gaudy Day. She wears very colorful clothing and makes
fun of my black clothes. (Hey...black worked for Johnny Cash! If only I
had been to prison and could sing.)

 Speaking

 Tip for Today 
 W is for whole grains 
(I bet you thought it was going to be water ! It should have
been, but you should have gotten the &quot;pitcher&quot; by now.)
From the American Dietetic Association: Whole-grain foods are rich
in complex carbohydrates and fiber and low in fat. Beyond that, they&apos;re
important sources of antioxidant nutrients, including vitamin E and
selenium. Whole grains supply minerals such as zinc, copper, and iron,
and vitamin B 6 .

 Want or need?
 Pastor Bob&apos;s sermon yesterday was on how much in our
lives we want and how much we really need. We often get them confused.
If we bought only what we actually needed, we could probably all retire
early. If we ate only what we needed, instead of what we wanted, we&apos;d
all be in a lot better shape.

Learn to distinguish between the two. Are you really hungry or do you
just feel like a snack? Maybe you&apos;re thirsty. Try a glass of water
first before heading for the snack drawer. We are so accustomed to
plenty...and more...that we often times forget that our needs are not
that big. &quot;A glass of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou...&quot;

 The Grapevine 
 Added another Faddasser to this list, perhaps a little unwillingly,
but he&apos;s there. Welcome, Steve. Hope you enjoy your daily Fadd Grams.
Remember, you always have a DELETE button. (Oh, if life were as simple!)

Dave Buchanan is heading a group of people who are going to serve
breakfasts to hunters over MEA weekend. It&apos;s at the church and will
begin at 5:30 AM (I think) and go until 9:30 AM. He&apos;s a good &quot;cooker&quot;
so even if you&apos;re not hunting, you might want to stop in.

After three trips to Willmar and Scott working until 1 AM to get the
thing together, Quinn thinks he might like his air mattress better than
the loft bed. Mackenzie would like it, but doesn&apos;t want to give up her
big room to get it. Another continuing saga in our family.
 
 Tip for Today 
 A bowl of oats 
Years ago when Scott was about 4 years old, we had an early-morning
breakfast in western South Dakota. An old cowboy came into the
cafe, swung his leg over the stool, and said, &quot;Give me a bowl of oats.&quot; Scott
thought that was about the funniest thing he&apos;d heard and all the way to
Oregon he repeated it...often. Well, a bowl of oats is good for you.
It&apos;s extremely good for your heart and can help lower your cholesterol.
Today is a good day to start celebrating Oatmeal Day; it&apos;s kind of
miserable out there and something warm in the tummy would feel pretty
good. What you put on your oatmeal is a personal thing. Some people
like sugar, others insist on cream; my brother-in-law loves brown
sugar. I like fruit. Oatmeal can now be made in the microwave so it
doesn&apos;t take long to prepare. Try some.

 Smile for Today 
 A tough old cowboy counseled his grandson
that if he wanted to live a
long life, the secret was to sprinkle a pinch of gun powder on his
oatmeal every morning.

The
grandson did this religiously to the age of 103. When he died, he left
14 children, 30 grand-children, 45 great grandchildren, 25 great-great
grand children, and a 15 foot hole where the crematorium used to be.

 Preparing for winter...
 The weekend weather has been perfect for getting all
the outdoor preparations for winter done. A bit windy at times
yesterday, but today is just gorgeous.

We need to get our bodies ready for winter, too. Get the warm clothing
out, buy extra lotion, and stock up on oatmeal so you can have a hot
breakfast. If you&apos;re prepared, the weather isn&apos;t nearly so bad. In
Ireland, they say, &quot;There&apos;s no bad weather...just inappropriate
apparel.&quot; I think I&apos;ve told you that before, but between writing this
every day and talking most of the time (if someone will listen...and
sometimes even when they won&apos;t) my recall on what I&apos;ve said is pretty
poor.

The blustery snow showers the other day were just practice. The real
thing could surprise us any day now. Shivering may burn up a few more
calories, but pneumonia isn&apos;t worth it.

 The Grapevine 
 Did you tell the Sunday School teachers &quot;Thank You!&quot; today? I tried,
but think I may have missed a couple. When I was in grade school, I
went to release time at the Alliance Church in Onamia. During the
summer, they held Vacation Bible School at District 40, our country
school. They were both great learning experiences and I often
wonder
if those ladies had any idea how important their teachings were in my
life. I should have told them, but I didn&apos;t realize it then.

Made the third trip to Willmar last night after supper. We picked up
the forgotten board and turned around and came right back home. The
great thing about it was that this time my friend Deanna was free and
she rode along. We had a nice, long chat and I&apos;m really thankful for
the forgotten board. Isn&apos;t it something...we live less than two blocks
apart, but with our separate nanny duties and other things in our busy
lives, we don&apos;t see each other that often.

Tomorrow is my first &quot;Schedule Day&quot; so we&apos;ll see how it goes with the
kids, and how it goes with me. (See Day 127) I&apos;m going to have
to quit procrastinating and that is going to be a big hurdle. I&apos;ll let
you know.
 
 Tip for Today 
 V is for variety 
Variety can make eating so much better. The same old food, prepared in
a different, way can seem like a whole new eating experience. Get those
cookbooks out and experiment. There&apos;s a great site on line called All
Recipes. The recipes are submitted and reviewed by the readers. You can
look at the comments to see if it&apos;s something you might like. My family
and I have tried a lot of their recipes and have never been
disappointed. http://allrecipes.com/Default.aspx They also have a section on healthy eating.  http://allrecipes.com/recipes/healthy-living/main.aspx

 ...Today is Honey Bee Day
...Today is Monarch Day
...Tomorrow is Sunday School Appreciation Day

 It&apos;s been a yo-yo day...
 Started off for Willmar this morning to look at a loft
bed. Bought the bed; came home and got the pickup; went back to Willmar
to get the bed and came home again. Got home and there was a message
from the seller that one of the side boards was still leaning on his
fence. So it looks like another trip back there...maybe yet tonight.
It&apos;s going to be a surprise for Quinn and since he&apos;s with his Mom this
weekend, it would be a good time to get it set up.

Some days you just keep going back and forth and don&apos;t seem to get
anywhere. Whether it&apos;s life or the Faddassers, you just have to take a
deep breath and start over. Eventually, you&apos;ll get to your destination.

 The Grapevine 
 Scott has been down at the fitness center all day. New carpeting was
installed and it really looks nice. Been a lot of work for him, but
he&apos;s so anxious to get it updated. I bought a new bathroom vanity and
sink when I was in Willmar so he&apos;ll have some painting and plumbing to
do, too.

Remember that tomorrow is Sunday School Teacher Appreciation Day. They
do so much and get so little credit. Give them a pat on the back and a
big &quot;Thank you!&quot;
 
 Tip for Today 
 U is for urine 
No, this is not a food tip; it&apos;s a health tip, and a very important
one. I keep harping on drinking enough water and I will keep doing so.
I was talking with an athletic coach last Sunday and he said he tells
his team that they must drink lots of water; that dehydration is an
everyday occurrence and a continual battle for athletes. Unless you
have other medical problems, a daily check of your urine will tell you
if you&apos;re drinking enough water. A small amount of dark-colored urine
means that you&apos;re dehydrating. It should be light and almost colorless
if you&apos;re drinking enough water. Also, a strong smell to the urine is
another sign.

With the heating season upon us, we need to keep our bodies hydrated
because of the drying effects of the heat. You can use all kinds
of
lotion, but the best moisturizers come from the inside.

 Smile for Today 
 A
Sunday school teacher was telling
her class the story of the Good Samaritan, in which a man was beaten,
robbed and left for dead. She described the situation in vivid detail
so her students would
catch the drama. Then she asked the class, &quot;If you saw a person lying
on the roadside all wounded and bleeding, what would you do?&quot;
   
A thoughtful little girl broke the hushed silence, &quot;I think I&apos;d throw
up!&quot;

...Today is U.S. Navy Day

 Anchors aweigh... 
 Anchors Aweigh is the anthem of the U. S. Navy. It was composed
in 1906 by Charles A. Zimmerman, with lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles. Zimmerman
was at the time a Lieutenant, and had been bandmaster of the U.S. Naval
Academy Band since 1887. Miles was a Midshipman First
Class at the Academy, in the
class of 1907, and asked Zimmerman to assist him in composing a song
for that class, to be used as a football march. The song was first
played during the Army-Navy football game on December 1, 1906, at
Franklin Field in Philadelphia. Before a crowd in excess of 30,000,
Navy won the game 10-0...their first win in the match-up since 1900. Recruits are taught during boot camp that when
this song is played or
sung, as a U.S. Navy Sailor, you are to stop doing whatever it is you
are doing, stand at attention, and sing. --- Wikipedia Encyclopedia 
 
To weigh anchor means to haul the anchor aboard the ship in preparation
for departure. The sailors would yell &quot;Anchor&apos;s aweigh&quot; to let the
commander know that the anchor was up and the procedure completed.

What kind of anchor are you pulling around? An anchor of weight? An
anchor of low self-esteem? An anchor of rage or anger? Whatever is
holding you down, keeping you in one place, needs to be moved so you
can continue on your journey. Lighten your life&apos;s load and you can say,
&quot;Anchors aweigh!&quot;
 
 The Grapevine 
 Here&apos;s a salute to all our Naval friends and family, both past and
present. We have several ex-sailors among our Faddassers. Thanks, guys!

Now I&apos;m going to have that song running through my head all weekend!
It&apos;s a peppy song and would make good walking music. When I want to
really get some cleaning done, I put on my tape of marching songs. (The
tape is like new.) It&apos;s pretty hard not to move to the beat. It&apos;s very
insistent.

No bonfire tonight because of homecoming in Montevideo...which is a
good thing because the wind is really strong. If you live on the right
side of the street, all the leaves have blown off your lawn into the
neighbor&apos;s yard. There are virtual sheets of leaves blowing around.
Very autumny. (Just love doing that to Spell Checker.)
 
 Tip for Today 
 Eggs can be egg-zactly what you need 
Celebrate World Egg Day. It&apos;s okay to eat eggs. Unless you have a
definite medical problem that dictates no eggs, go ahead and enjoy
them. They&apos;re another food that has been in and out of the health food
circle. The latest studies say that an egg a day won&apos;t hurt you a
bit...yolk and all...if you watch that you&apos;re not loading up on other
foods with cholesterol. You should have no more than 300 milligrams of
cholesterol a day and an egg yolk has 215. Doesn&apos;t leave a whole lot
for the other stuff, but it can be done. Of course, if you fry them,
you&apos;re off the top of the cholesterol meter. The new sprays take care
of that problem, along with the no-stick cookware.And don&apos;t forget the
&quot;hidden eggs&quot; in mixes and packaged foods. (Sounds like an Easter
event, doesn&apos;t it!)

 Smile for Today (This ones

 There was once a
Scotsman and an
Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen
and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen&apos;s
eggs for breakfast.

One day he looked outside and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the
Englishman&apos;s garden. He was about to go next door when he saw the
Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and
told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. The
Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.

They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, &quot;In my family
we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I punch you in the
nose and note how long it takes you to recover, then you punch me in
the nose and note how long it takes for me to recover, whomever
recovers quicker wins the egg.&quot;

The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman held the heaviest
object he could find, took a few steps back, then ran toward the
Englishman and punched him as hard as he could in the nose. The
Englishman fell to the ground and was howling in agony and holding his
nose for thirty minutes.

Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, &quot;Now it&apos;s my turn to punch
you.&quot;

The Scotsman said, &quot;Keep the lousy egg.&quot;

 ...Today is Dessert Day

 Save the best for last...
 Dessert Day. A favorite for most of us. When I think
of a dessert, I think of something chocolate with loads of whipped
cream. It&apos;s the &quot;topping&quot; for our meal...the last thing served. In
European countries the meal ends with fresh fruit. Fruit knives are
part of the place setting and as the family peels their fruit, they
enjoy the fresh, juicy taste...a taste that doesn&apos;t make you feel like
you&apos;re overstuffed. Just a light, piquant ending. Most of us have
European ancestors. Why aren&apos;t we doing this?

 The Grapevine 
 Here in Montevideo, it&apos;s been snowing all day and there&apos;s a blustery
wind. Not pleasant weather to be out in. Last week it was 80 degrees
and we were roasting; this week we&apos;re freezing. You can&apos;t say Minnesota
doesn&apos;t offer a variety when it comes to temperatures. We go from 110
in the summer to 40 below in the winter. That&apos;s 150 degrees...quite a
temperature range. But then, we&apos;re tough.

 From one of our Faddassers yesterday: Just
checked my fadd gram, I may not be the best speller so it gives me
great pleasure to ask, what is a teaspoon of sale? 

Yesterday I had several typos in my Fadd Gram. Actually, they were
words that were spelled right...at least that&apos;s what Spell Checker
said. The only thing is, they weren&apos;t the right words. You have to
admit that a teaspoon of sale is a lot easier to handle than a
high-pressure sale. :-)

 T is for tacos 
Tacos have become part of the mainstream American diet. They&apos;re very
healthy and really tasty. You can spice them to fit your taste buds.
Our grandkids like &quot;Baby Tacos.&quot; We prepare hamburger with taco
seasoning and then use the Scoops tortilla chips to scoop the meat out.
You can add sour cream, salsa, lettuce...whatever you want. You&apos;re
pretty much limited to one or two extra ingredients because of the
small size of the Scoops. I love them with a squirt of sour cream and
some ripe olive slices. You can have tortillas on hand for the hungrier
ones in the family. My daughter gave me this idea and I&apos;ve brought them
to several of our campfires this summer.

would have to point at the Sausage Pizza on the menu and say
emphatically, &quot;LITTLE SAUSAGE pizza.&quot; Took some of those girls awhile

 Got this message from Faddasser Linda, and it goes right along with
the &quot;name thing&quot; in today&apos;s Fadd Gram.
 
Our daughter is 14 today. Brooke loved her Grandma Bev and so I
thought of her this morning when I was looking for my &quot;honeysuckle&quot;
muffin recipe from the family cookbook.  The story goes
that Brooke was
(and still is) a fussy eater, but has a pretty big sweet tooth. I
used
to limit her sweets, but when she went to Montevideo, anything was
OK
at Grandma&apos;s. So for many years, Grandma always
had &quot;honeysuckle&quot;
muffins ready and waiting for &quot;little missy&quot;. She would sometimes
eat
three in a row. It wasn&apos;t until recently that she found out
they were
actually zucchini muffins!
---------------------------------------
 And from Faddasser Gail, who had the Today Show on this
morning.

 I caught
the word moderation, and thought this was interesting. It was by
Willard Scott.
   &quot;People that live to be 100 say they eat right, stay fit,
practice moderation. Most say faith in God plays a big
part. By and
large, they are the most positive people I have ever known. Age
and
infirmity haven&apos;t dampened their zest for living. There&apos;s
the
101-year-old man who walks a half mile each day; the 107-year-old
woman who never misses a Red Sox game; and the former Ziegfeld
Follies
star who still dances.&quot;   Wonder
which one or two of the Faddassers will make it to 100?

 S is for salt; S is for sodium 
Here are some interesting notes about salt, as provided by the American
Dietetic Association.
 
 1 teaspoon of salt contains about 2,300 milligrams of
sodium Most sodium that Americans consume comes from
processed or prepared food...not from the salt shaker at the table A preference for salty foods is acquired You can cut back on salt in your food choices without
giving up flavor 
 To
keep the flavor and consume less salt, use herbs like celery seed,
garlic powder or onion flakes.

 Scheduled for what?
 Last night I made up schedules for Scott and his kids.
Each has their own schedule of things to do after school. In thinking
about it today, I decided that maybe I should make a schedule for
Grandma, too. It would only be fair. They have to do homework, pick up
the stuff in their rooms, lay out clothing for the next day...stuff
like that. My schedule will be similar. It would be nice to not
scramble at the last minute to see if I have a clean uniform. It
wouldn&apos;t hurt me to keep my room from being messy. And I could
definitely add exercise to that list. I&apos;m going to have the grandkids
check it for me once a week while I&apos;m checking their schedules. I
really do my best work under pressure.

Why not put yourself on schedule for weight loss and good health? I
challenge you to find a schedule partner and go for it.

 Sounds like we may get our first flakes of snow within the next

 R is for rice 
Rice is kind of a forgotten food for many of us, but it shouldn&apos;t be.
It&apos;s tasty, full of fiber and, if you use instant rice, can be prepared

with the recipe. For example, if it&apos;s a Spanish Rice, cook the rice in
tomato juice. Making glorified rice? Cook it in pineapple juice. The
rice absorbs the liquid, as well as the flavor, and it no longer has
the bland taste.

Here&apos;s what I hope DOESN&apos;T happen with the new schedules. 
 The homework
schedule 
 Here is an explanation
of the
school homework policy for the average student. Students should not
spend more than ninety minutes per night. This time should be budgeted
in the following manner if the student desires to achieve moderate to
good grades in his/her classes.

 
 15 minutes
looking for assignment. 11 minutes
calling a friend for the assignment. 23 minutes
explaining why the teacher is mean and just does not like children.  8 minutes
in
the bathroom. 10 minutes
getting a snack.  7 minutes
checking the TV Guide.  6 minutes
telling parents that the teacher never explained the assignment. 10 minutes
sitting at the kitchen table waiting for Mom or Dad to do the
assignment.

 ...Today is
Columbus Day
...Today is Leif Erikson Day
...Today is Canadian Thanksgiving

 It&apos;s about YOU!
 Whether you think Columbus discovered America, or if
you think he was preceded by Leif Erikson, what really matters is
discovering YOU! You need to dig deep and discover you and what you
really want. Do you really want to be thinner...or would you
just like to be thinner. Do you really want to quite
smoking...or do you think it would be nice, but it&apos;s probably something
you won&apos;t accomplish.

You need to do it because you want to be healthier; you need to do it
because you want to feel and look better; you need to do it because you
think you deserve it. Once you can convince yourself that you&apos;re worth
it, then make the commitment and do it! There&apos;s no time like now.
Tomorrow is in the future. Today is here and you can take that first
step. Go ahead. You can do it because there is not another person in
the whole wide world who is you. You&apos;re it! Go!

 The Grapevine 
 One of our Faddassers is giving up smoking while trying to
lose
weight. He&apos;s combining abstinence from tobacco with moderation in his
eating habits. We know he can do it, but he&apos;s going to need our
prayers. That is a big undertaking.

Just ruined another pan. I was heating apple cider because the house
was pretty cold and we needed to warm up. I gave Lyle his cup of hot,
steaming apple juice. Then I came back to finish the Fadd Gram and
suddenly my sniffer alerted me to the aroma of burned apple. There is
just a blackened crust on the bottom of the pan. Didn&apos;t turn the burner
off. Thankfully, it was one of my cheapo pans and nothing caught fire.
This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve done this, but when it was cast aluminum
and stainless steel pans without a no-stick coating, Lyle could take
the pan over to his shop and sandblast it. This one is past that. It
needs to go to the garbage...soon.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Q is for quick 
No time to cook? Need something quick?
There are a lot of good foods out there that are frozen. I eat Lean
Cuisine meals almost every day for lunch. No dirty dishes and a very
tasty meal. Plus no leftovers that tempt me to take seconds. Check the
packages and find the ones that are low cal and low in sodium. Not
every one of them is the meal of your dreams. (I tossed the LC pork
dinner. Couldn&apos;t hack it.) As you try different brands and different
kinds, you will come up with a very palatable solution for those
moments when you&apos;re in a hurry. 
 
Smile for Today 
I&apos;m not saying I burn the food often, but when Lyle hears the smoke
alarm go off, he thinks it&apos;s time to eat.

...Today is Fluffernutter Day

 And a Fluffernutter is?
 That&apos;s the question I asked, so I looked it up.
 
 Fluffernutter 

 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 A Fluffernutter is a sandwich made with peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff, a brand
of marshmallow creme . Many Fluffernutter
eaters insist that no other brand can be substituted. The use of Wonder
Bread is also favored. It is particularly popular in the U.S. New
England states where Marshmallow Fluff is readily available. 

 Variations of this recipe include the addition of bananas,
honey, graham crackers , M&amp;M&apos;s ,
or any ingredients that are deemed compatible with peanut butter. 

 &quot;Fluffernutter&quot; is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower Inc. , the maker of
&quot;Marshmallow Fluff&quot; brand marshmallow creme. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma was
selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under
the &quot;Fluffernutter&quot; name. 
 

 -------
 It&apos;s hard to imagine marshmallow creme on white
bread.
Yuck! Doesn&apos;t sound like a healthy sandwich, but
evidently the taste is popular. I believe it is the official state
sandwich of Massachusetts. 
 The Grapevine 
 Our family spent the afternoon at the Nelson Pumpkin Patch southwest
of Litchfield. Wonderful place. All five of the grandkids together for
some old-fashioned fun. The kids loved the place...and it was all
simple things. 

 Tip for Today 
 P is for ...what else?...pizza! 
It&apos;s America&apos;s favorite food, or if it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s very close. Pizza
doesn&apos;t have to be loaded with calories if you make the right choices
for toppings. Thin crust is best; whole wheat thin crust even better.
Canadian bacon is better than sausage or pepperoni; and pineapple and
mushrooms are better than olives and extra cheese. One slice of a
medium pizza (cut into 1/8s) is a little less than 200 calories. Order
a salad and eat it with your pizza. You&apos;ll be less apt to have the
second or third slice. Many pizza places are now offering veggie
pizzas, too. There are all kinds of options. You don&apos;t need to give up
pizza; you just need to think about the toppings when you order.

 ...Today is
Bathtub Day
...Today is Frappe Day
...This is Clergy Appreciation Weekend

 The Saturday night bath...
 Someone knew what they were doing when they made
Bathtub Day on a Saturday. Back in the days when water had to be hauled
into the house in buckets, and then heated on a wood stove, baths were
weekly Saturday night rituals. It was too time and energy consuming to
be done every day. How times have changed. We&apos;re supposed to have new,
modern technology, but give me an old cast-iron, claw-foot bathtub any
day. I was thinking about that this week when I was having back
problems. Back when we lived on the farm north of Watson, my brother
hauled an old bathtub all the way from upper Michigan for me. On nights
when the pain was bad, I would get up and soak in warm water in that
deep, old tub until the pain was relieved. The water went all the way
up to...well, anyway, most of my body was covered. The new standard
size bathtubs have overflows that are about 10&quot; above the drain. If you
have real skinny thighs, you might get them covered. For the &quot;fuller&quot;
body shapes, it&apos;s like sitting on a wet towel.

Just like the bathtubs, it&apos;s good to get back to the basics sometimes.
Basic food, basic exercise and basic sleep patterns. We&apos;d all feel
better and be a lot healthier if we did.
 
 The Grapevine 
 We&apos;re going to leave right after church tomorrow morning and head
for the Nelson Pumpkin Patch near Litchfield. Our daughter Sandy and
her triplets will meet us there. Jenny Sather Olson and her Mom, Sue
Sather, are bringing little Landon, who is almost a month old, to the
Pumpkin Patch, too, so that he can meet his &quot;Aunt Sandy.&quot; It&apos;s always
been confusing to the people of Montevideo because the Sather kids have
called Lyle and I &quot;Grandpa&quot; and &quot;Grandma&quot; since they were toddlers.
We&apos;ve been to all the family birthdays, baptisms, confirmations,
graduations, and weddings. They&apos;re family, as far we&apos;re concerned, but
it does make people scratch their heads a little.

This is Clergy Appreciation Weekend so thank your pastor tomorrow. (You
are going to church, aren&apos;t you?) We have a wonderful pastor who
manages to be a good friend to each of us in our small congregation. He
puts us at ease, but still manages to get his wonderful messages
across. I have done an occasional sermon and it&apos;s not that easy. I
can&apos;t imagine having to come up with something every Sunday. People
seem to think a pastor should be able to keep them riveted to the pews
every week. Let me tell you, you should all have the opportunity to do
the sermon at least once. You&apos;d REALLY appreciate your clergy then. So,
&quot;Thank you, Pastor Bob. We just love being a part of the Evangelical
church family.&quot; 

Note: Bob is the one who pushed me into doing the Faddassers and for
that I&apos;m grateful. Just got a new pair of jeans (two sizes smaller) and
I can wear them, zip them, and still breathe!
 
 Tip for Today 
 Why not frappe today 
 Since today is Frappe Day, let&apos;s learn a little about
it. I kind of knew what it was, but not really. It&apos;s pronounced fra-pA and comes from the French word frapper , which means to chill.
It&apos;s a drink that is chilled or partly frozen. Coffe Frappe, an iced
coffee, has become the newest national drink of Greece. They love it,
and it was only invented 50 years ago. Iced coffee doesn&apos;t sound
that
good to me, but I love iced tea, so perhaps I&apos;d really like it. I&apos;ll
have to give it a try. Go to this web site to learn more about it. It&apos;s
really interesting.

 Pastor Bob
gave his
Sunday morning service, as usual, but this particular
Sunday, it was considerably longer than normal. 
 Later, at the door, shaking hands with
parishioners as they moved out, one man (let&apos;s call him Dan) said,
&quot;Your sermon, Pastor, was simply wonderful ... so invigorating and
inspiring and refreshing.&quot; 
 The minister, of course, broke out in a
big smile, only to hear the man add, &quot;Why I felt like a new man when I

 Good old Friday...
 I&apos;m thinking about putting Fridays in my will. They&apos;re
very special to me. Always there when you need them. The only problem
is that they&apos;re the prelude to the weekend and, much as I love the time
off, I tend to forget about eating schedules on weekends. And therein
lies my problem. I need to get up and eat breakfast and not graze. I
need to start thinking with my head instead of my stomach. And...I need
to &quot;just say no!&quot;

 The Grapevine 
 I
thought this was the Friday that the Schwan&apos;s man comes, and I was
trying to tell myself that I should give fudgesicles another try. Just
when I decided, what the heck, let&apos;s do it, I realized this wasn&apos;t
Schwan&apos;s Friday. Who says God isn&apos;t watching us! He&apos;s evidently got His
eye on more than just the sparrow!

The movie in Watson should be starting any minute now. My back is just
getting where I can sit without pain so I&apos;m going to pass on sitting in
a lawn chair and getting chilled. Hate to miss it though.
 

 Tip for Today 
 O is for oranges 
One of my favorite foods is fresh-squeezed orange juice. Whenever I get
near a Byerly&apos;s, I buy a couple of quarts. Orange juice is so healthy
and so refreshing. There&apos;s nothing like that fresh taste. Juice from
concentrate doesn&apos;t even come close...although it&apos;s not bad...it just
isn&apos;t the same as fresh-squeezed. (Or is it sqwuzz?) When we were
little, for special occasions, our Mom would make us orange cartwheels.
She did this by placing the orange pieces around a center &quot;hub&quot; of
powdered sugar. It was so good. And a little household hint: Run the
peelings through your garbage disposal, if you have one. It leaves a
lovely, fresh scent and lasts for several grindings.

 Walk the walk...
 Today is Long Walk Day. What a gorgeous day to do just
that. One of these days the walking conditions will deteriorate and
you&apos;ll wish you&apos;d taken advantage of the beautiful Autumn days.

Walking is some of the best exercise you can get. And you don&apos;t have to
walk 10 miles to make it beneficial. It&apos;s been proven that short walks
are good. So get that heart pumping and enjoy the smells and colors of
Fall.

 The Grapevine 
 Good news for Faddasser Linda. They sold their house up north and
can now look for permanent housing in New Ulm. They&apos;ve been camping in
a small one-bedroom apartment for a few months until their house sold.
The wide open spaces will be really welcome. Not that the honeymoon is
over, but it is nice to be able to pass each other in the kitchen
without sucking your stomach in. :-)   Big is better in housing.

Reminder that tomorrow night is the season finale for outdoor movies in
Watson. It will start pretty early because darkness descends at a
much
earlier hour now. Bring your own popcorn.

Made it through a whole day of work today. Grabbed a bottle of
Ibuprofen out of the cupboard to take with me. Didn&apos;t want to take the
mega dose prescription I have. It makes me a little tipsy. The bottle
from the cupboard had an expiration date of January of 2000 so I
decided to take Excedrin instead. Lots more caffeine than I&apos;m used to
so I&apos;ve been wound pretty tight today.
 
 Tip for Today 
 N is for nuts
 Nuts are another protein option. They also provide fiber and other phytonutrients .
They can be added to salads and casseroles, sprinkled on yogurt, or
mixed in with cereal. I have become hooked on Cheerios and walnuts.
They make a wonderful breakfast with milk and also a great snack just
left dry. I&apos;m working on a lower-calorie snack option. I&apos;m going to
take a bottle of I-Can&apos;t-Believe-It&apos;s-Not-Butter spray and add a couple
drops of Watkins walnut flavoring. Then I&apos;m going to spray the Cheerios
on a cookie sheet and bake them for a short time. I&apos;m hoping I&apos;ll get
the nutty flavor without the extra calories.

A little trivia. Dry-roast and oil-roasted nuts have about the same
amount of calories. The nuts do not absorb much oil when they&apos;re
roasted. The oil is part of the nuts and peanuts themselves. Like
everything else, moderation is the key. A small handful...not a jar.

 As I was saying...
 Sometimes I live in my own little time zone. Monday
morning when I checked my e-mail, I realized that I had completely
forgotten to do a Fadd Gram on Sunday. By Monday night, I hadn&apos;t heard
a word so I began to wonder if anyone was really reading them. I
decided to wait. I got my first message Tuesday morning and do you know
what? The message didn&apos;t ask where in the world the Fadd Grams were; it
said, &quot;Are you okay? We&apos;re concerned.&quot; Three other Faddassers have
contacted me, either in person or by e-mail, and they all asked the
same question, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Yes, I&apos;m okay. Thanks for your concern. It made me feel great.

Now we need to get back on schedule and make up for lost time. After
talking with several Faddassers, I&apos;m wondering if we haven&apos;t become a
little too complacent on our journey. Perhaps it&apos;s time to &quot;Just say
&apos;No!&apos;&quot; for awhile. If you&apos;re eating healthy food and practicing
moderation and you haven&apos;t lost weight for several weeks...it&apos;s time.

Which uncle would that be, Mark? ;-) 

Actually, I am having some medical problems. Have had severe back pain
for the past two days. Hopefully, a little pampering and exercise will
get me back in shape. It&apos;s not much fun.

On the brighter side, the last outdoor movie of the season will be this
Friday night on the big screen by the Evangelical Church in Watson.
Uncle Dan the Popcorn Man has stopped pursuing that career and is going
to sit down and enjoy the movie for a change. So...it&apos;s a B.Y.O.P.
situation...bring your own popcorn; bring your own pop. If he&apos;s not
available, bring someone else&apos;s. We&apos;ll still have a pot luck snack
table for those who want to bring snacks to share. There will also be a
bonfire to keep us warm. Last time there was a lot of litter left on
the grounds for Pastor Bob to pick up. I think it would be good to have
a Flashlight Patrol and then we you could all pitch
in and help clean up. I can&apos;t bend over, but I could carry a flashlight
and tell you what to do. I&apos;m good at the &quot;telling&quot; part.

 M is for milk 
Have you had your milk today? It&apos;s important that you do. Milk is a

 While walking down the street one
day, a
US senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul
arrives in
heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.

&quot;Welcome to heaven,&quot; says St. Peter. &quot;Before you settle in, it seems
there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts,
you see, so we&apos;re not sure what to do with you.&quot;

&quot;No problem, just let me in,&quot; says the man.

&quot;Well, I&apos;d like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we&apos;ll
do is
have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you
can choose
where to spend eternity.&quot;

&quot;Really, I&apos;ve made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,&quot; says the
senator.

&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but we have our rules.&quot;

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down,
down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the
middle
of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse, and standing in
front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked
with him.

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him,
shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while
getting rich at the expense of the people.

They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster,
caviar and
champagne. Also present is the devil, who really is a very
friendly
guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are
having
such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go.

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator
rises...

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St.
Peter is waiting for him.

&quot;Now it&apos;s time to visit Heaven.&quot;

So 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls
moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a
good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St.
Peter returns.

&quot;Well, then, you&apos;ve spent a day in hell and another in Heaven.
Now
choose your eternity.&quot;

The senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: &quot;Well,
I would
never have said it before, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but
I
think I would be better off in hell.&quot;

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down
to hell.

Now the doors of the elevator open and he&apos;s in the middle of a barren
land covered with waste and garbage.

He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash
and
putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The
devil
comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder.

&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; stammers the senator. &quot;Yesterday I was here and
there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar,
drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there&apos;s just a
wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?&quot;

The devil looks at him, smiles and says, &quot;Yesterday we were
campaigning...... Today you voted.&quot;

 Queen for a day...
 What&apos;s the use of being &quot;queen&quot; if you can&apos;t make a
royal pronouncement once in awhile? (There. I celebrated Ask a Stupid
Question Day.) I had big plans for doing things today, but when I
got
up at 6 AM, I decided to take the day off and celebrate me
instead. So
I read the paper, went back to bed and slept until 9:30, and then
managed to stay up until 2:30, when I could take a nap.

Back in the 50s there was a radio and then TV show called &quot;Queen for a
Day.&quot; Host Jack Bailey , in
pre-airing interviews with audience members, would select
3-4 contestants who would pour out their (mostly pitiful) hearts
explaining why they deserved to be Queen for a Day, and the audience
selected the winner . She was draped
in a sable-trimmed red velvet robe and a jeweled crown. And more; she
got whatever she had
requested. 

 There are days in your life when you just need to
pamper yourself. It makes life a lot
easier. When you feel overwhelmed, stop and smell the flowers. It&apos;s
wonderful. I think it will be an annual event...or maybe even monthly!

 L is for lentils 
The weather is getting cooler and we&apos;re approaching &quot;soup season.&quot;
Nothing smells better than a pot of soup. Today most of us use a crock

They are tasty and cook quickly. To find out more about lentils, visit

Talked to Faddasser Jean today and she told me how she and Fadd Bob had

had not given up his cream. He gives up something else to compensate
for it. Well, she tried it and now she&apos;s hooked. Can&apos;t seem to get

What made this a little weird was that I stopped at Java River for
coffee before work this morning, and Vernon Lund, one of their older

 Tip for Today 
 K is for kohlrabi
 It&apos;s pronounced KOLE-rah-bee. 

Kohlrabi is a light-green member of the turnip family and looks and
tastes almost like a turnip. You can use it in any recipe that calls
for turnips. You can slice it and use it in stir fry or peel it and eat
it raw or put it in salads. (American Dietetic Association) 

 The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to
those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of
flesh to skin. The young stem in particular can be as crisp and juicy
as an apple, although much less sweet. (Wikipedia) 

 In the British Isles turnips are called Neeps and are boiled
and mashed with potatoes. It&apos;s very good. Since I didn&apos;t have a clue on
how to prepare kohlrabi, I looked it up on the Internet. Go to this
page for prep instructions. http://www.victoryseeds.com/catalog/vegetable/brassica/kohlrabi.html

 J is for Jello 
Put the &quot;J&quot; into jiggle with Jello. Every time I eat Jello, I wonder
why I never make it. The fact is, I forget about it. It&apos;s easy and oh,
so tasty. Whether it&apos;s in a salad, in blocks, or just plain, it is just
plain good. Here&apos;s some info from the Jello Web Site.
 
American families have been going for something JELL-O®since 1897, when
JELL-O gelatin was invented by Mr. Pearle B. Wait in Leroy, NY. Today,
JELL-O gelatin is the world&apos;s most popular prepared dessert, selling
over 300 million boxes every year.
 Fun Facts 
 
 JELL-O gelatin was given
its name by Mr. Waite&apos;s wife, May. The four original JELL-O gelatin flavors were
strawberry, orange, lemon, and raspberry. Nine boxes of JELL-O gelatin are sold every second in the
United States. Jack Benny, Andy Griffith, and Bill Cosby have all
been spokespersons for JELL-O gelatin . 
 Give
your JELL-O gelatin an unexpected zing by adding club soda, ginger ale,
or a carbonated fruit drink. Click here for more recipes.

 Crazy
Food Facts Where Calories Don&apos;t Count 
 Food on foot: All food eaten while standing has
no calories. Exactly why is not clear, but the current theory relates
to gravity. The calories apparently bypass the stomach, flowing
directly down the legs, through the soles of the feet, and into the
floor...just like electricity. Walking seems to accelerate this process
so that a frozen custard or hot dog eaten at a carnival actually has a
calorie deficit.

 Two divine...
 After several weeks of just coasting along, my
weight
loss this week was &quot;two divine.&quot; I just came from the grocery store,
and, yes, I went there at 5 PM...the jungle hour. Because I&apos;m getting a
little quicker on my feet, I managed to avoid any serious injuries from
groceries carts pushed by frenzied working mothers and those used as
go-karts by young, unsupervised children. Even though I was hungry
(another reason not to shop at 5 PM) I managed to control myself and
buy 80 bucks worth of healthy food. Figured if I was there, might
as
well make it worthwhile.

The two pounds has been a real boost. After the dry spell, it feels
like 20. Now whenever I&apos;m tempted, I think about the 3 pounds I have to
lose and I&apos;ll be down into the next (what DO you call 20-lb.
increments?)...zone. So remember...little things, when added together,
make big losses happen. Hang in there. It may take awhile, but
eventually it will happen.

 Note that the bonfire is going to start an hour earlier...sixish.
I&apos;m going to bring an old family favorite which will separate the men

 Tip for Today 
 I is for Ice 
If you want a real thirst-quencher that&apos;s also really refreshing, try
ice water. So many times we just grab a glass and fill it from the
faucet. Filling a glass with ice and then adding water (or in my case,
tea) is so much nicer. Remember the &quot;G&quot; item---garnish? A twist
of
lemon with either water or iced tea adds a little zing to your drink.
Don&apos;t chug-a-lug...sit down and sip it. Savor the coolness as it
trickles down your throat. Iced drinks aren&apos;t just for hot weather
either. As the home heating systems kick in, the air is going to become
very dry and you&apos;ll need to drink liquids to keep your skin from
itching.

 More to obesity than meets the eye...
 Just re-read an interesting article entitled &quot;10
Causes of Obesity Other Than Overeating, Inactivity.&quot; I&apos;ve shared some
of them with you in earlier Grams.

 Medicine . Many different drugs---including contraceptives,
steroid hormones, diabetes drugs, some antidepressants and blood
pressure drugs---can cause weight gain. Use of these drugs is on the
upswing.
 Population age, ethnicity . Middle-aged people and
Hispanic-Americans tend to be more obese than young European-Americans.
Americans are getting older and more Hispanic.

 Interesting. I understand how a person can get older, but how can
you get more Hispanic? Eat more burritos? Seriously, sometimes
it&apos;s a no-win situation. Example: contraceptives. How fat do you think
you&apos;d get if you quit taking them? Another example: antidepressants.
You don&apos;t take the medicine and become so depressed that you use food
as an emotional outlet. Another one: If you watch TV, you&apos;ll sometimes
see ads for sinus medicines, followed by a disclaimer that says the med
could cause headaches, congestion, etc. Good Jay Leno material, and he
makes great use of it.

So if you&apos;re having problems losing weight, and you&apos;re definitely
giving it the old college try, then maybe you are taking a medicine
that is hindering weight loss. Check with your doctor. It won&apos;t hurt to
see, and it&apos;s something you should do anyway.

 H is for hot cakes 
Wanted to do something in honor of Pancake Day and it&apos;s &quot;H&quot; day in the
Tips, so let&apos;s make it &quot;hot cakes.&quot; Pancakes are good for any meal.
It&apos;s the toppings that you have to watch. Use a butter spray instead of
butter. After all, it melts anyway. Try all-fruit preserves as a
topping. They&apos;re all natural and very tasty. As kids, we used to
sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar on hot cakes and roll them up. That was
good, too. And remember: we&apos;re not giving up sugar, we&apos;re just not
using as much.

They scrambled around the house, undoing what I&apos;d done, and just before

 Seconds...
 The traffic mentality has been close to zero lately.
People are taking chances that could have serious consequences, and all
to gain a few seconds of time. They pull out in front of you from a
side street, they pass when they shouldn&apos;t. Drivers have gotten crazy,
and it&apos;s no wonder that road rage continues. I&apos;ve counted, and
sometimes it involves only four or five seconds of waiting. Wouldn&apos;t
you think that the risk of human life and limb would be worth five
seconds of time?

Seconds do count when it comes to eating. &quot;It&apos;s not the minutes
spent at the table that put on the weight, it&apos;s the seconds.&quot; By
practicing moderation, we don&apos;t count the seconds. Why? Because we
don&apos;t have any. Eat the first helping and then wait. It takes about 20
minutes for the messages from a full stomach to reach the brain. (That
is, if the brain is located where it&apos;s supposed to be. Some of those
drivers seem to be sitting on theirs.)

 The Grapevine 
 Got through the sermon okay. It was kind of hit and miss, right up
to the last minute. It seemed like Satan didn&apos;t want me to do it,
because there have been roadblocks all week. But it is done, and I hope

 Tip for Today 
 F is for Fitness 
There are so many good &quot;F&quot; topics...food, family, fad diets,
fiber...but we&apos;re going to focus on fitness. In order to achieve a
healthy life style, you need exercise. Even if you&apos;re not physically
able to do aerobic activities, there are exercises that you can do.
Walking is one of the best. It strengthens your respiratory and
cardiovascular systems, your bones, and stabilizes your blood pressure.
No special equipment is needed and it can be done any time. Try 10-20
minutes a day to begin with. Pretty soon you&apos;ll want to do more. Before
you know it, you&apos;ll find yourself walking a mile or two a day. Exercise
can be addictive, but if you&apos;re going to be hooked on something, it&apos;s a
good one to have.

 Chocolate is good...
 Too
bad I found out so late in the day that it was Chocolate Day. I could

practice
moderation so it would have been only for half a day.

A small piece of dark chocolate has been found to be good for you.
Several scientific studies show that dark chocolate (not white
chocolate or milk chocolate) can help control blood pressure and make
you healthier. In moderation, of course. For more information, go to
this web site. It&apos;s very interesting.

 We are now the parents of a gym owner. Scott purchased 1st Street

It&apos;s pretty cool. Has a card-entry system like a hotel so you can go

something he&apos;ll enjoy. 

 Tip for Today 
 E is for Evaporated Milk 
With the advent of convenience
stores and big refrigerators, evaporated milk isn&apos;t seen in advertising
like it once was. I always have several cans on hand. The evaporated
skim milk is great for making cream sauce or adding to vegetables. On
Nestle&apos;s web site they state: ...made from fresh whole milk with half the water
evaporated, delivering twice the calcium of regular whole milk. Perfect
for cooking and baking, and for whitening your coffee or tea.

 There are tons of
recipes out there. I used to whip it and use it for whipped cream
topping. Keep a can in your refrigerator because it whips best when
it&apos;s cold. Bit of trivia: their web page says that the cans are
now
made so they&apos;re stackable.
 1 cup
NESTLÉ®CARNATION®Evaporated Milk
1/4 to 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 POUR
evaporated milk into small mixer bowl; place beaters into mixture.
Freeze for about 30 minutes or until ice crystals form around edge of
bowl. BEAT on
high speed for 1 minute or until very frothy. Gradually add sugar and
vanilla extract; continue beating for 2 minutes or until mixture is
stiff. Serve immediately spooned over fresh fruit or your favorite
dessert. 

 Makes 4 cups.

 It&apos;s Fri-i-i-i-day!
 For some of you with &quot;non-traditional&quot; hours, it&apos;s
just another day. For the Monday-Friday workers, today is the one we
look forward to all week. It&apos;s our earthly day of redemption. For me,
today seems like Saturday, since I took a vacation day to watch my
Monte grandchildren. (No school today.) I&apos;m doing the sermon in our
church on Sunday and I don&apos;t know how many times today that I&apos;ve had
little jolts of panic, thinking it was Saturday and I wasn&apos;t ready yet.

Sometimes a little jolt of panic is good for you. Actually, I usually
function the best under pressure or little jolts of panic. I am
big-time into the process of getting organized now so perhaps Good
Housekeeping will eventually let me renew my subscription again.
We&apos;ll see. My heroes are those organized people who don&apos;t have to panic
because they&apos;ve kept on schedule and done a little every day. They can
welcome drop-in visitors without a qualm.

Organization is important in eating, too. It&apos;s the same story, second
verse. If you don&apos;t have something healthy on hand when hunger pangs
strike, you&apos;ll eat whatever&apos;s handy. Stock your cupboards and
refrigerator like there was going to be a three-day blizzard. If it&apos;s
there, you&apos;ll eat it. Make it something good...and healthy.

 Tip for Today 
 D is for Degreaser 
You can get rid of a lot of calories by just &quot;degreasing&quot; your food
before you eat it. Blot your hamburger patty with a paper towel or
napkin before you eat it. Brown meat in a nonstick pan and some
vegetable oil spray. Using two tablespoons of oil to brown meat will
add an extra 240 calories. Grill, roast or bake meat on a rack so the
fat drips down.

 ...Today is supposed to be
International Day of Peace. Unfortunately,
according to the media, it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s going to happen. 

 In rainy Monte town...
 It&apos;s almost like being in Ireland in the winter
again...at least here in Montevideo. Scattered showers and cold that
goes right into your bones. It&apos;s a good night to stay home with a good
book and a warm blanket.

Years ago, a good share of the clothes were cotton and if they were
washed in hot water, they would shrink. In the 50s, a lot of the
clothing was &quot;Sanforized&quot;...which meant it wouldn&apos;t shrink as much.
Today most of the clothing is made up of blends and they don&apos;t wrinkle
and they don&apos;t shrink.

There have been times in my life when I really thought I must be
Sanforized because no matter how hard I tried, I didn&apos;t shrink. Now, as
I get older, I find that I am shrinking, only it&apos;s in height,
not weight. And the shorter I get, the less pounds I can weigh to be
&quot;normal weight&quot; for my height. (According to the charts.) It sometimes
seemed like a no-win situation, but now that we&apos;re doing our Faddasser
bit, I&apos;m enjoying my food and losing, too.

Join me on the journey. We&apos;ll travel together.

 Tip for Today 
 C is for calcium 
It is one thing to use moderation, but you need to be careful that
you&apos;re still getting all the vitamins and nutrition that you need.
Calcium is vital to keeping your bones strong and it is something that
doesn&apos;t end with your &quot;growing years.&quot; You need to continue to get the
daily requirements. Getting them naturally, like in dairy products and
fruits and vegetables, is best. Calcium supplements are good, too, but
remember: they are exactly what their name says...a supplement. That
means in addition to your normal daily calcium intake.
Weight-bearing activities also help strengthen your bones. On the other
hand, smoking and excess alcohol both interfere with healthy bones.

 Many of us started our journey during the height of

loss. Several of you have mentioned that you&apos;re eating less, but the
food isn&apos;t as healthy as it was. Things
are slacking off a little, but there&apos;s still plenty of fresh fruit out
there.

Fruit is usually high in fiber and pretty low in calories so they may
make you feel fuller faster. And because most of them require quite a
bit of chewing, look at all the exercise you get! It&apos;s a win-win
situation: The good taste of fruit, and vitamins to boot!

 It&apos;s time to come clean...
 Who was it who decided to have Laundry Day on a
Tuesday? Don&apos;t they know you wash on Monday , iron on Tuesday,
mend on Wednesday, churn on Thursday, clean on Friday, bake on Saturday
and rest on Sunday? Evidently they didn&apos;t have any relatives who
embroidered dish towels; otherwise they&apos;d have known better.

Just as we have to launder our clothing, we also need to clean up our
eating activity.
...Brush after every meal, if you can. It makes your mouth feel
fresher, and will make you think twice about getting food or drink
on
your freshly-cleaned pearly whites. 
...Rinsing is an important part of laundry, and to eating, too. If you
can&apos;t resist temptation and must have a cola, remember to r inse your
mouth after you&apos;re finished . The cola softens the enamel on your
teeth
if it stays there, so get rid of it. HOWEVER, do not brush your teeth
after you&apos;ve had cola. Wait for at least an hour. Your toothbrush can
do damage to the vulnerable, softened enamel. ...Grandma used a
washboard to get at the tough spots; we use dental floss. A clean mouth
will keep your teeth strong...&quot;the better to eat meat with, my dear.&quot;

 Tip for Today 
 B is for butter 
There&apos;s often the question of which spread is better for you: margarine
or butter. Actually, they both have about 12 grams of fat per
tablespoon, but margarine has a third less saturated fatty acids, so it
would be a little better for you. For those who truly enjoy the taste
of butter, there is the option of moderation. A little good taste is
better than more not-as-good taste. For myself, I&apos;m definitely hooked
on I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not Butter spray. I had an egg for supper
tonight and sprayed a little ICBINB on it. The buttery flavor was
definitely there. Of course, the spray doesn&apos;t work on toast or bread
very well,
but on vegetables and popcorn, it&apos;s great.

 Thank You Day is celebrated today and it sounds like

yourself for hanging in there and practicing moderation and healthy
eating; thank yourself for being there for family and friends; thank
yourself for caring enough about those you love (and who love you in

 A is for Apples 
It&apos;s getting downright chilly outside. Now is a good time to warm up a

 He
was only a chocolate chip cookie...but I loved him.

I met him at a party. There he was at the end of the buffet...a loner,
the last one on the plate. He had a certain something...a sweetness, a
sensuality. He was one hot cookie. I felt as if I&apos;d always known
him...hungered for him.

When he looked at me with those warm, brown eyes, I melted. Before I
knew it, I had my hands on him, my mouth all over him...in public!
After that night, we were inseparable. With him, I could be myself. He
didn&apos;t seem to care what mood I was in, how I looked, or even if I
gained weight. Together we had the recipe for happiness. No one
satisfied me like Chip.

 Then things changed 
My friends said he was no good for me. He made my heart pump harder,
and gave me heartburn. He hung onto me, fastened himself to my hips,
and wouldn&apos;t let go. I felt crummy, but I knew it had to end.

Now we&apos;ve gone our separate ways. I hardly think of him anymore. Oh, if
I see a certain TV commercial, a particular magazine ad, a coupon for
money off...that old longing returns. And when we run into each other
in the supermarket, we nod. We&apos;re friendly, but it&apos;s over !

God bless America...
 The song, God Bless America , is a powerful
song. &quot;...land that I love, Stand beside her and guide her, through the
night with a light from above.&quot; We had a dramatic audio presentation in
church this morning. Perhaps you have heard it on the radio. It is a
9/11 tribute. I don&apos;t know what the title is, but it was like God was
speaking, and He said, &quot;I was there. I was there with you...in
the stairwell, on the 28th floor, on the plane.&quot; It was a reminder that
no matter what the situation, or where we are, God will be by our side,
helping us get through it.

Are we standing beside our country and helping guide her, or are we
letting our freedom and our country slip through our fingers? We take
so much for granted in this life that we sometimes don&apos;t realize what
we have until we lose it. Protect your freedoms. We have our spiritual
freedom through the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus, and we have
our physical freedom through the death and determination of our
citizens. Don&apos;t take anything for granted. Tomorrow it may be gone.

God bless America.

 (Step down from soap box) 

 The Grapevine 
 It is wonderful how &quot;God works in mysterious ways...&quot; Yesterday I
was thankful for my friends and so I wrote my Devotional and called it
&quot; Friend,&quot; without even looking at the events calendar. And today I
found out it is Women&apos;s Friendship Day. How cool is that!

Then to top it off, when I checked my e-mail early this morning, there
was a response to the devotional from my friend and fellow Faddasser,
Kris. This is the message she sent, and I&apos;d like to share it with you.

 Jean---what a wonderful message. Thank you. I
am working on exercise. I took a rowing class, learning how to
row
those long, skinny crew boats with 8 people! If we ever get
together,
believe me, I can regale you with funny stories! I also joined
Curves
with a friend from work, so just started that this week. I am
thinking
about going back to Weight Watchers, but one thing at a
time. I find
that since my daughter married and moved out, it is really difficult to
eat balanced meals and resist snacking...no one looking over my
shoulder! I enjoy your messages. Keep &apos;em comin&apos;! 

You can do it, Kris. Just plan your evening meal ahead of time so it&apos;s
ready to heat up when you get home. Pamper yourself. Sit down and eat
it in style, and as I keep repeating, savor it. You&apos;re worth it.
 

 Tip for Today 
 Write it on the back... 
As I&apos;ve said before, I get tons of &quot;forwards&quot; in my e-mail. One of the
recent ones told how a small post office in the southwestern part of
the U.S. was told they had to remove a sign that read IN GOD WE TRUST.
A local radio announcer suggested that his listeners write the words IN
GOD WE TRUST on the back of all the mail they send out. A few days
later, I got a similar one, and they suggested we write IN GOD WE STILL TRUST on the back of our envelopes. I don&apos;t use snail mail that much
anymore, but I&apos;m definitely going to do some writing on the back. Might
even print a few labels.

 The tide is turning...
 Our younger Faddassers probably don&apos;t know who Twiggy
is...she was famous before their time. Twiggy Lawson was an English
model and actress of the 60s who had a figure like a stick; hence the
name Twiggy. She was the epitome of thinness. If you thought someone
was a little chunky, you could say, &quot;Well, you&apos;re okay, but you&apos;re no
Twiggy!&quot; That person would understand exactly what you meant. Models
and starlets of today are overly thin, too, and often look emaciated.

Last week Spain started a new trend: they want their catwalk models to
look healthy. Their decision is echoing through the modeling houses of
the world.
 
 No Skinny Models Wanted in Spain 
 From the Associated Press
September 9, 2006 
 Spain&apos;s top fashion show has turned away
a slew of models on grounds
they are too skinny—an unprecedented swipe at body images blamed for
encouraging eating disorders among young people.

Organizers of the pageant, known as the Pasarela Cibeles, used a
mathematical formula to calculate the models&apos; body mass index—a
measure of their weight in relation to their height—and 30% of the
women flunked, said the Assn. of Fashion Designers of Spain.

The association said Friday it wanted models at the Sept. 18-22 show to
project &quot;an image of beauty and health&quot; and shun a gaunt, emaciated
look. 

 The trend setters are leaning
in the other direction, and I think it&apos;s about time. There are so many
people, especially young girls with peer pressure to be thin, who have
eating disorders. When looking at catalogs, it&apos;s hard to envision
yourself in an outfit modeled by a girl who could fit her whole body in
one pant leg of your size clothing. Big is not especially the best, but
it&apos;s better...better because it is more often healthier.

Off-the-wall diets not only make you look gaunt and sickly, but they
take the luster out of your hair (for those who still have some) and
the glow from your skin. Besides all the cosmetic defects they can
produce, they&apos;re just not healthy.

Keep on eating healthy foods and using moderation. By Christmas time,
we could be like Baby Bear&apos;s porridge...just right. Just right for our
bodies, and just right for the stage of life we&apos;re in.


 The Grapevine 
 The bonfire was held last night, as scheduled. The fire site is
pretty protected, so evidently the wind didn&apos;t hinder them too much. I
decided to stay home because I was just plain tired. (As opposed to
fancy tired...that&apos;s right...I&apos;m a simple girl.)

Faddasser Mark had an addition to my Smile for Today from
yesterday, about not trying this at home.
 &quot;And don&apos;t forget about my theory that every house has a personality. Mine has a bipolar disorder...clean one minute, dirty the next.&quot;

Can&apos;t argue with logic like that. My house must be related. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s bipolar or not, but there&apos;s certainly disorder.

 ...Today is Make a Hat Day

 How many hats do you wear?
 Today is Make a Hat Day and, although we don&apos;t
actually make them, each of us wears many hats. For instance, I&apos;m wife,
mother, grandmother, receptionist, and queen. ;-) That&apos;s some of the hats (and one crown) I wear, but
only a few of many.

Have you ever noticed that when you&apos;re wearing certain hats, you don&apos;t
eat as much? When I wear the receptionist hat, I&apos;m so busy that I don&apos;t
have time to eat. Hardly even think about it. Although, one day when we
had treats at work, and I came back to my desk, chewing vigorously. Who
should be standing there, but Faddassers Bob and Mark. There wasn&apos;t
much I could say, but they laughed and said, &quot;You&apos;re busted! You&apos;ve
been caught.&quot;

When I&apos;m wearing the wife hat and preparing food, then the temptation
to eat is very strong. A little taste here, a lick-the-spoon there, and
a finish-the-leftovers-since-there&apos;s-not-enough-to-put-on-the-table.
Little things that add up to a lot...probably as much as the meal
itself. So what happens? I&apos;ve actually had two meals, even though I
used moderation on the second.

With the weekend upon us, we might have to switch hats. One of the
reasons I don&apos;t eat at work very often is that I&apos;m busy. Wear your
&quot;busy hat&quot; on the weekend. It doesn&apos;t have to be work, but find
something to keep you busy , and you&apos;ll be less likely to eat. We&apos;re
not giving everything up, so do enjoy some healthy snacks.
Instead of
candy or pop, or cake or chips, however, have some fruit juice or V-8
(low-sodium, of course) or fruits, vegetables, milk...something
healthy. You&apos;ll feel much better about yourself on &quot;weigh day.&quot;

 Haven&apos;t heard any update on the bonfire. They&apos;re a pretty robust

talking to Bob and Mark today, and someone passing by made the remark,

on good housekeeping and thought they said, &quot;Don&apos;t try this at home!&quot;

 Figment of your imagination?
 Are you really eating less...or do you just think you&apos;re eating less? Take a good bird&apos;s-eye view of your portions. Is
the serving size less than you used to have 100 days ago? It is easy to
spoon on the food, take a quick glance, and think, &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s less
than I used to eat.&quot; After awhile, if you think it long enough, you&apos;ll
believe it&apos;s true.

Remember that one serving of meat is about the size of a box of regular
playing cards. I know we&apos;re not measuring and counting, just using
moderation, but if it isn&apos;t really moderation, but hallucination, you
need to re-dish your food. Portion distortion is the little crack in
the dike that will eventually let all the water (pounds) come in (or
back) if it isn&apos;t taken care of.

 The Grapevine 
 One late-bloomer in the crowd.
 I read some of the testimonials and remembered I never wrote you back on my progress. Even though I have yo yo&apos;d back and forth, with your help I am eating a lot better. I have probably had 50 or 60 more salads than without the help of Faddassers. Thanks again Jean!!!! 

FRIDAY NIGHT BONFIRE
The bonfire is scheduled for tomorrow night at the Buchanan farm. The weather forecast is for 20-30 mph winds and a 60% chance of thunderstorms. Sounds like a delightful night for a bonfire. Will keep you updated.
 
Tip for Today 
Know your portions 
Eat from a plate, not a package, so you know how much you eat. Start out with small helping and put the rest out of sight. Chew slowly and savor the taste.If, after 10 minutes, you&apos;re still r eally, truly hungry, then take a little more. Smile for Today 
 During a visit to America, Winston
Churchill was invited to a buffet luncheon at which cold, fried chicken
was served. Returning for a second helping, he asked politely, &quot;May I
have some breast?&quot; 

 &quot;Mr. Churchill,&quot; replied the
hostess, &quot;in this country we ask for white meat or dark meat.&quot;

Churchill apologized profusely.

The following morning, the lady received a magnificent orchid from her
guest of honor. The accompanying card read: &quot; I would be most obliged
if you would pin this on your white meat.&quot;

 Day 100 
 ...Today is the
100th day of our journey
...Today is Positive Thinking Day

 The first 100 days...
 Faddasser Bob suggested that we do a little report on
the first 100 days of our journey. The President of the U.S. usually
gives a speech on the first 100 days of his term in office. Of course,
the President is elected and this is a monarchy ( :-) ), but I think it&apos;s a
great idea. Even knowing how much I like to talk, I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve
sent 100 messages to you! Here are the messages I got in response to my
e-mail last week.
 
 Jean, the Fadd Grams
are great I look forward to them every day and, as
of this week, I&apos;m down 25 lbs. Keep it up... you are doing a great job
of
inspiring us. Thanks!!!! 

 I love the Fadd
Grams... They definitely keep me doing better during the week...
weekends, however are definitely a challenge. I haven&apos;t lost really
much more, but I did order a misses size 18 in pants and they fit
great... so something is helping... Gotta be you! My ultimate
goal is misses 14.... but I&apos;m thinking 16 misses is more
realistic. Thanks. 

 Am still at the loss of
16 pounds, but (my friend and I) are still getting in some walking.
With the start of school, the early morning isn&apos;t working, and she is
busy sometimes (in the afternoon.) But we haven&apos;t given up. I am doing
some exercising at home. Just keeping the &quot;Just Say No&quot; theme in mind
always helps. 
 
 Yes, you have helped.
Am waiting for day 100. Tomorrow I go to the Dr. so I will check
my
weight on a real scale .   
 
 Maybe now
during this fall season, I will
think of Fadd Grams when I see all those Halloween treats.   They do help bolster my self control if I
read before I chew!!   Thanks for
hanging in there for us and cheering us on, even when we maybe haven’t
been as faithful as your daily Fadd Gram is in coming to my mail box.
Thanks again. 
 
 Actually, I noticed
this morning that the Faddassers have passed the 3 month point. I&apos;d be
very interested in seeing any specific results y&apos;all are seeing if
you&apos;re comfortable sharing them. It seems to me that a key to success
is being able to objectively quantify results, and one of the strengths
of you all doing this together is that you have other people to help
give you the &quot;objective&quot; part. Just a thought . …praying that God will give you
all strength and overwhelming success.
 

 These are great
inspirations! I will have to keep better track of the
weight loss since I have read your Fadd Grams.

 The bonfire this week is going to be hosted by Dave and Amy. They

Tomorrow is going to be Day 101. Let&apos;s start over again and pretend

coasting, and that&apos;s not bad, but we could be stepping on the
accelerator and really getting somewhere on this journey.Think positive

 ...Today is Day 99
...Today is Video Games Day

 Get real...
 We all have dreams of being our high-school size
again, but it probably isn&apos;t going to happen. We need to set a
realistic goal...one that we can reach. It could be getting to a
certain size clothing; it could be a specific amount of pounds; or it
could be until we feel good. Each Faddasser is unique; each Faddasser
is a different age and has a different metabolism, a different
lifestyle and different goals. We need to work to satisfy ourselves and
not worry how we appear to others.

A good idea is to come up with the largest size that you&apos;d be content
with and aim for that. If you&apos;re a size 20, maybe a size 16 would make
you feel satisfied. If you were a size 8 in high school, I have to tell
you that the sands have shifted and the hour glass is filling on the
bottom...if you get my &quot;drift.&quot; For some of us, getting out of women&apos;s
sizes and getting into misses&apos; sizes...even if it&apos;s an 18 ...would be
something we could live with. Pick a reasonable goal and then work on
it. If you choose something that&apos;s almost unreachable, you&apos;ll become
discouraged and quit and then you&apos;ll gain. A half loaf is
better than none. That may not be the best metaphor for us,
but you know what I mean.

The tags on clothing have, for several years, been also in Spanish.
There&apos;s something disheartening about buying a size GRANDE or worse
yet, a MUCHO GRANDE. At least XL is more subtle. You can translate it
to mean whatever you want. I like to think of it as meaning &quot;more
durable&quot;...extra lasting.

Remember: You&apos;re number one and pleasing you is what counts. Do it for
yourself and you&apos;re more likely to succeed. Do it for yourself because,
as the hair product ad proclaims, &quot;You&apos;re worth it!&quot;


 The Grapevine 
 Tomorrow is Day 100 and I&apos;ve had only a couple of e-mails. We&apos;ll see
what happens. I hope that the Fadd Grams are helping you in your
journey, and are uplifting to you whether you&apos;re losing weight or not.

 Can Non-Stick make you sick? 
That&apos;s the name of a special produced by ABC news. There is growing
evidence that Teflon can cause flu-like symptoms and even cancer in
humans. I&apos;m going to do more research and I encourage you to do the
same. I know aluminum is bad. Even if it wasn&apos;t, it makes my fillings

but it sounds like it&apos;s a lot safer.

 Today is about loss...
 Today is about loss, but it&apos;s also about recovery. As
we remember the tragedy of 911, we need to do what we can to prevent it
from happening again. It was another day of infamy that changed the
lives of everyone in some way. But we are a strong nation, a determined
nation, and we are rebuilding our country and our lives. God bless
those who have given up so much that we might continue to enjoy freedom.

 The Grapevine 
 From Faddasser
Jen: 
I should have read your Fadd Gram earlier, because now I really feel guilty about
buying that fresh
Halloween candy that is out there, and telling myself that the boys
needed a
treat.   I think I have treated
myself more than they have….now I am miserable and glad that tomorrow
is
a new week and I will start fresh and have some male in my house hide
the
remaining fresh Halloween candy. Maybe now during this fall
season, I
will think of Fadd Grams when I see all those Halloween treats. 
------------
 I can relate to that! I bought a big bag of
Tootsie treats to bring to the bonfire Friday night. (For the kids, of
course.) I did indulge, but I only had one...at a time. The next day in
church, Pastor Bob had a message for the kids and, nodding toward me,
the lady who brought the candy. He said the kids had left candy
wrappers all over the yard and he had to pick them up the morning. I
brought the candy, but I didn&apos;t leave any wrappers laying around. I hid
mine in my pockets so no one could see how many I had eaten. 
 
Tip for Today 
 Loss and recovery 
Tomorrow is weigh day again. We need to recover from our
lackadaisical ways and start back on our plan: healthy food and
moderation.That&apos;s the only way we&apos;ll see the loss that we are
striving for.

 It seems like every month there&apos;s a new temptation. As Faddasser
Jen
mentioned above, now it&apos;s Halloween candy. I&apos;ve always preached: &quot;If
you have it around, you&apos;ll eventually eat it.&quot; Here&apos;s what I do for
Halloween. I buy a roll of dimes...$5 for 50 of them...and have them in
a dish. I give those out to the kids. I&apos;ve always been going to be
creative and put them in a little pumpkin envelope, but they don&apos;t seem
to mind plain cash. We don&apos;t have that many
trick-or-treaters, but even if
you had to buy two rolls, you&apos;d be money ahead. Candy is very
expensive, it&apos;s not good for the kids, and when you eat all the
&quot;leftovers,&quot; it&apos;s not good for you either. I used to end up buying
several bags before Halloween because I always ate them before it was
time. I haven&apos;t been desperate enough to swallow dimes...yet.

 A simple formula...
 There&apos;s no magic formula about losing weight. It&apos;s
simple logic: You need to consume fewer calories than your body uses
every day. To do that, you have two choices (1) Cut back on calories,
or (2) Increase your exercise. Even better, do some of both.

There are all kinds of diets out there. More carbohydrates, less
carbohydrates; more meat, no meat; fasting, feeding. When it comes to
calories, your body isn&apos;t selective. It doesn&apos;t say, &quot;Today I feel like
protein calories&quot; or &quot;Today I think I&apos;ll be vegetarian.&quot; Your body
takes whatever calories are available and uses what it needs. Most
excess calories are then stored on your body as fat.

This is where moderation comes in. By taking small steps like cutting
down on portions, leaving the cream out of your coffee, or eating
broiled instead of fried, you will end up with a lower calorie intake.
Try for &quot;even&quot; first. As you become accustomed to smaller portions, try
other things that will cut calories down even more, without taking away
from the taste of the food. Eventually, your body will have to dig in
the &quot;pantry&quot; for fat to use in its burning process. That&apos;s where the
formula ends up with a negative balance and you end up with a positive
attitude.

 Haven&apos;t heard from anyone yet about the influence of Fadd Grams in
their eating. The 100th day is only three days away. Would like to hear

 Cuddly is good...
 Fat and cuddly, not so good, unless you&apos;re a little
pig. If you&apos;re a big pig, then go for cuddly and get rid of the fat.
This is Teddy Bear Day and teddy bears are definitely cuddly; so are
blankies and poohs. We all have our &quot;security blankets&quot; and that&apos;s
good. Hopefully, your security blanket isn&apos;t food. For a lot of us, it
is.

Food can be comforting; it&apos;s convenient, and no one raises their
eyebrows when they see an adult dragging it around. If food is the
focus for releasing your stress, you need to search for a new focus.
Walk out the door and take a quick trip around the block. Do some
washing. Grab a good book and read a few chapters...away from food. (A
cookbook would probably not be a good choice at this point.) Music is
another way to take your thoughts off food. Your favorite music can
relax you and swing your thoughts in a different direction. I know it&apos;s
tempting to chew in time to music, so if you do, go for a slower
beat...nothing bouncy. (Does anyone but me listen to &quot;bouncy&quot; anymore?) 
 
When nothing seems to work, remember that there is a Greater Comforter,
but that&apos;s getting into this week&apos;s devotional.

 Sometimes you just have to walk away and regroup.

 What do Winnie the Pooh and Rupert the
Bear have in common?
 Their middle names.
 
 And one more...
 If you&apos;re a bear, you get to hibernate. You do nothing but sleep
for six months.
I could deal with that.

Before you hibernate, you&apos;re supposed to eat yourself stupid.
I could deal with that, too.

If you&apos;re a mama bear, everyone knows you mean business. You swat
anyone who bothers your cubs. If your cubs get out of line, you swat
them, too.
I could deal with that.

If you&apos;re a bear, your mate EXPECTS you to wake up growling. He EXPECTS
that you will have hairy legs and excess body fat.

 ...Today is Pardon Me Day
...Today is Nose Hair Maintenance Day (I only included this because I can&apos;t believe
someone actually dreamed up such a day. Are there nose-hair stylists
out there somewhere?)
 
 Pardon me, but you need to get back on
track...
 The Faddassers I&apos;ve talked with lately have mentioned
that we need to get back on track. Since we&apos;ve done well up to this
point, we can&apos;t stop now. After reading yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram, I
decided it sounded more like my personal blog* instead of a Faddasser
blog. I do need to get back on track; I do need to get us back to the
basics. Perhaps we need a little refresher course.

I have a young friend who just started basic training in the Air Force.
He&apos;s not having a good time...hates it...would like to quit. He&apos;s been
selected as the recruit to pick on and he&apos;s really suffering.

The good thing about being a Faddasser is that we don&apos;t need to suffer.
We do, however, need to be tougher. You know my fudgesicle
thing...well, I&apos;ve been trying to catch the Schwan&apos;s man for two days,
but he&apos;s been rather elusive. Tonight I cornered him in the McDonald&apos;s
parking lot to buy mini cinnamon rolls for the grandkids. You have no
idea how tempted I was to buy fudgesicles. I came thatclose to
buying them. Then I thought, &quot;You cannot buy them. You know you&apos;ll eat
them. Get real.&quot;

So I am real... real hungry for fudgesicles, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll
survive without them. It&apos;s only three days until we weigh again. As the
platoon leader, I need to say, &quot;Get off your big butts so you can get
your big butts off.&quot; Let&apos;s see what Tuesday brings.

 Most of you probably know this information, but
for some of us, it&apos;s a little confusing. If you&apos;re a nerd, skip this.

*A weblog , which is usually shortened to blog , is a
type of website where entries are made (such as in a journal or diary),
displayed in a reverse chronological order.  
 Blogs often provide commentary or
news and information on a
particular subject, such as food, politics, or local news; some
function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web
pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily
textual although some focus on photographs (photoblog), videos (vlog)
or audio (podcasting), and are part of a wider network of social
media.  

 The word blog can also be
used as a verb, meaning to
maintain or add content to a blog. - -- Wikipedia

 Tonight&apos;s bonfire night. If you can make it, we&apos;d love to have you
join us.

Years ago, Dean Martin (if you don&apos;t know who he is, google him) had a
variety show. One of his lines became kind of a cult phrase: Keep
those cards and letters coming . I&apos;d like to hear from you, and not
just &quot;forwards.&quot; A lot of the time that&apos;s the only e-mail I get and
sometimes I feel like the Maytag repairman. So &quot;keep those cards and
letters coming.&quot; And while we&apos;re on the subject, I read my &quot;forwards&quot;
and save those I think I might have use for later. I do not forward
them to 10 people and I don&apos;t love you any less because I don&apos;t. It&apos;s
just something I don&apos;t do so if you don&apos;t get a response from me, don&apos;t
be concerned. I&apos;m still here. (Lots of &quot;don&apos;ts&quot; in that paragraph, but
look at the bright side: at least they&apos;re not donuts.)

 ...Today is Full
Moon Day 
 ...Today is Postal
Workers&apos; Day

 What rhymes with June? 
 Croon,
swoon, spoon...oh, yes, and moon. For you young Fadds, spoon is an old,
old word meaning to &quot;make love, by kissing or caressing.&quot; Years ago,
they were popular rhyming words in love songs. By the light of the
silvery moon, I want to spoon, To my honey I&apos;ll croon love&apos;s tune. Honey moon, Keep a-shinin&apos; in June, Your
silv&apos;ry beams will bring love&apos;s dreams, We&apos;ll be cuddling soon, By the
silvery moon.

 By the Light of the Silvery Moon w as the
theme song and the title of a 50s movie with Doris Day and Gordon
MacRae (a duo whose names also rhymed.) The song is a favorite
of barbershop quartets. Later on, words were added and sung by a second person or persons , while the the
soloist held the notes. Example: By the light ( not the
dark, but the light ) of the silvery moon ( not the sun, but the moon ) I want to spoon ( not croon, but spoon )...  

I guess you had to be there. 
 
 Moon facts: The moon controls the tides on
Earth through gravitational pull. Even though it is smaller than the
sun, since it is closer to Earth, it has a stronger effect on water and
earth. I&apos;ve always thought that only water was affected, but I read
that in some places the Earth&apos;s surface does rise and fall 1-2 inches
because of the Moon&apos;s gravitational pull. &quot;This(the tides) is achieved
only because the moon&apos;s gravity acts over the ... diameter
of the earth, which pulls back with a comparable force. But
the moon exerts no influence on smaller bodies of water,
such as lakes and even some seas, and the difference between a
person&apos;s weight in the presence of the moon&apos;s gravity and his
or her weight if there were no moon is &quot;less than the effect of
a mosquito on one&apos;s shoulder.&quot; ( Crowe R. Astrology and
the scientific method. Psychol Rep 1990;67:163-91 )

 Well, there goes my theory about the full moon making me weigh
more. That may be true, but you&apos;ll never convince me that it doesn&apos;t
affect people&apos;s behavior. Researchers
can say what they want, but try telling ER personnel, police, or
bartenders that a full moon doesn&apos;t create &quot;moon madness&quot; in some
people.

 Tomorrow night is the free movie and bonfire by the Evangelical
Church in Watson. We&apos;ll begin gathering about 7 o&apos;clock and the movie
will start when it gets dark enough. That won&apos;t be so late because the
days are getting shorter much too fast.

Some of our Faddassers are coffee lovers and were bummed that coffee
didn&apos;t count toward your daily intake of water. Here&apos;s an e-mail:
 Gee,
If coffee doesn&apos;t count…count me out! (just kidding.) 
 
In the movie mentioned above...or was it in the prequel &quot;On Moonlight
Bay&quot;...anyway, there&apos;s a scene with couples in canoes and the men are
strumming ukuleles as they croon love&apos;s tune. When we were cleaning
closets this weekend, we ran across my baritone uke and the grandkids
have been strumming ever since. Grandma let them take it home. :-)       Doesn&apos;t
bother
them that the instrument is not in tune, or even close to being tune,
but it rather grinds on their father. He, by the way, mentioned
something about getting bongo drums for them to play with at our house.
You can please some of the people some of the time...
 
 Tip for Today 
 Bigger is not better... 
It&apos;s very tempting, when eating out, or buying food, to buy the bigger
size because it&apos;s cheaper. If you have it, you&apos;ll eat it, unless you&apos;ve
got a lot more will power than most of us. When you super-size, the
super size goes to your hips. Hip-Hip Go-Away!

 How dry I am...
 Are you drinking enough water? I have been really
hungry lately and it seems like I crave a lot of food that I really
don&apos;t need. Did some research and found that hunger is a symptom of
dehydration. Your body gets to a point where it can&apos;t tell hunger
signals from thirst signals. Tests have proven that most of the time
when you wake up hungry and go for that midnight snack, you really are
thirsty. Drink a glass of water and, in a short time, you won&apos;t feel
hungry. Dehydration can cause fatigue, migraines, joint pain,
drowsiness, loss of concentration and irritability. Just a few of the
effects.

After thinking about it, I know that I haven&apos;t been drinking enough
water. I tend to forget about it when I&apos;m at home, so the long weekend
was pretty dry. I&apos;m going to really concentrate on drinking enough
water. It&apos;s Do It Day...so I&apos;ll do it!

 The Grapevine 
 Not much feedback from our Faddassers. Hope the weigh-ins went well
yesterday. Remember the free movie and bonfire in Watson on Friday
night.

My brain well is running a little dry tonight and I have an appointment
soon, so will talk with you tomorrow.
 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Coffee doesn&apos;t count...
 Water means water. It does not include beverages with alcohol or
caffeine. A glass of cool water is very refreshing. It doesn&apos;t need any
additives. You can&apos;t improve on perfection.

going to bed, take the red pill with another big glass of water.&quot;

 ...Today is Be
Late for Something Day

 But not dinner...
 There&apos;s a saying, don&apos;t
know who said it, but it goes:
&quot;You can call me anything, just don&apos;t call me late for dinner.&quot; We&apos;ve
all heard it. Since today is Be Late for Something Day , I
suggest that if you ARE going to be late for something, it IS dinner.
The evening meal seems to be the heaviest and it&apos;s not good to go to
sleep with a full belly. Judging by my profile in the mirror, it
wouldn&apos;t hurt me to miss a meal or two, and it probably wouldn&apos;t hurt
any of us. The thing is, it&apos;s not good to miss a meal. Being late and
missing the first serving is one thing; being so late that you miss the
entire meal is something else.

Your body needs to be fed on a regular basis or your survival button
hits the panic button and they do a tag-team scream and start storing
fat. Your body is insecure and needs to be reassured on a regular basis
that there is going to be food available. Then, and only then, will
your survival button relax and let your body burn up some of the extra
fat.

Eating many small meals throughout the day is called grazing. Grazing
is good, as long as you use moderation. It&apos;s when you go too long
without food that your sense of direction goes screwy and you head for
the handy Oreos, instead of the crisper in your refrigerator, where you
have to spend all that time opening the door and the drawer. Think
before you sink your teeth into something you really don&apos;t need.

 The Grapevine 
 The Friday night bonfire is going to resume again this week. We&apos;re
going to have it at the Evangelical Church in Watson and sit outside
and watch the Ma&amp;Pa Kettle movie. The last time we tried to do
that, severe weather forced us to call it off. Hopefully, this week the
weather will cooperate.
 
 Tip for Today 
 An apple for the teacher, an apple for you... 
It&apos;s apple time again. There&apos;s nothing like the crunch of a good, crisp
apple as it cuts into your gum tissue on the first bite. M-m-m-m. Just
joking. Apples are so healthy and so good. Whether you like them sweet
or tart; green, yellow, or red, there&apos;s an apple on a tree somewhere
that&apos;s just for you. And remember, &quot;An apple a day, keeps the doctor
away.&quot;

For some odd reason, I remember the song from the 1953 Senior Class
Play in Cottonwood. Have no idea what it was about, but there was a
catchy little tune that went like this: An apple a day, they say,
keeps the doctor away, okay; but an apple a day will never keep me from
you.
 
An apple a day can help control what you weigh.

Moving further along the lunch line, at the other
end of the table, was a large pile of chocolate chip cookies. A child
had written a note, &quot;Take all you want. God is watching the apples.&quot;

 Quick way to lose...
 This morning in the grocery store, I overheard two
people talking. One of them said, &quot;I lost my butt in 10 minutes.&quot;

&quot;Wow!&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Even South Beach isn&apos;t that fast.&quot; I edged
closer to see if I could pick up any tidbits on weight loss. I mean,
this was extreme .

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he continued, &quot;I was down 40 before I left.&quot; He had a butt that
weighed 40 pounds?! I shoved my cart nearer and dug in my purse
for a
pen and note pad. They would think it was my grocery list and I could
write this great information down so I could pass it on. Pen poised, I
tried to look like I was checking my list, but my ears were tuned to
the conversation.

&quot;Everything was tight for me today,&quot; replied his friend.

&quot;Buns of steel!&quot; I thought. &quot;That man must exercise a lot.&quot;

Then he added, &quot;I tried different machines, but nothing happened.&quot;
You&apos;d think a man with buns of steel would know that you don&apos;t get immediate results from different exercise machines.

The first guy...the one who lost his butt...turned to go, and I
panicked. &quot;Don&apos;t go yet!&quot; I&apos;m shouting in my mind.&quot;You haven&apos;t told me
the secret to your weight loss!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s the last time I go to the casino for awhile.
Well, see you later.&quot; As he disappeared around the end of the aisle, it
was obvious that everything was still behind him.

There is no quick and easy way to lose weight. It takes patience and
perseverance. Use moderation. Eat healthy foods. And hasten slowly.
Take time to enjoy life. Haste makes waste...or in our case: Haste
makes waist.

Tomorrow is a new beginning. Let&apos;s go for it!

 The Grapevine 
 To those of you who helped me search for my earring after church: I
found it on my bedroom floor. Evidently, I arrived at church wearing
one earring. I&apos;m
disappointed. I thought wearing one earring meant you were available
and no one even asked. ;-) 

 Also, I just proved to my children that I could
write a Fadd Gram based on &quot;I lost my butt in 10 minutes.&quot; When they
heard the line, they snickered and said, &quot;There you go, Mom. You can
write about that for the Faddassers.&quot;

Smart alec kids.
 
Tip for Today 
 Preparation fixation... 
 Preparation
is vital to good-eating habits. It may sound like repetition and that&apos;s because it is. I can&apos;t stress
enough the fact that you need to have healthy foods around. If you&apos;re
hungry and there&apos;s nothing healthy available, your only choice is
between bad and not-so-bad. Hunger makes it easy to justify eating bad
food today and making up for it tomorrow. It usually doesn&apos;t happen.
Have healthy choices available and the decisions you make will be
good...good to eat and good for you.

 ...Today is Football Day
...Today is Working Mother&apos;s Day

 Follow the game plan...
 Today is Football Day. The sporting seasons are
running together: Baseball is winding down and football is at the line
of scrimmage, ready to tackle the new season. Fantasy Football teams
are being put together and favorite-team shirts are coming out in
bright colors. September is an exciting time in sports. Unlike sandlot
days, there is a rhyme and a reason to professional sports. They have a
game plan. If you don&apos;t follow the game plan, you usually don&apos;t
win...unless the opposing team does a worse job of sticking to the
plan. Preparing a game plan and sticking to it is an important part of
being a winner.

The same applies to losing weight. Even though we know how to &quot;play the
game,&quot; we still need guidance; we need a game plan. The Faddassers have
a game plan: Eat in moderation and choose healthier foods. Today is the
90th day of our journey. Some of us have forgotten to check the map and
have gotten off the beaten path. We need to think back to the first
days of our trip and try to regain some of the enthusiasm. We&apos;re
getting too relaxed in our routine and are straying away from the
original plan.

Think about the plan, check the map, and let&apos;s get a fresh start
on
Tuesday morning. It&apos;s the first day back to school for some and for us
it can be the first day back on our journey. Let&apos;s hit the trail!

 School supplies... 
One of the exciting things about going back to school is getting the
school supplies. As we get back on track, we need some supplies, too.
Get a small notebook for journaling; a good pen that stays with the
notebook; and a pedometer to see how far you&apos;re walking. We&apos;re
completing the first Faddasser summer. On Tuesday morning, be ready to
start on the second part of our journey...the autumn phase. (Never say
&quot;Fall&quot; to a clumsy lady; autumn; autumn&apos;s the word. It was a year ago
this weekend that I fell and broke my ankle.)

 In
honor of Labor Day, here&apos;s some poor guy&apos;s personal work history.
 
 My first job was working in
an
orange juice factory, but I got canned...couldn&apos;t concentrate. Then I worked in the woods
as a
lumberjack, but I just couldn&apos;t hack it, so they gave me the ax. After that, I tried to be a
tailor, but I just wasn&apos;t suited for it ...mainly because it was a
so-so job. Next I tried working in a
muffler
factory, but that was too exhausting. Then I tried to be a chef
...figured it would add a little spice to my life, but I just didn&apos;t
have the thyme. I attempted to be a deli
worker,
but any way I sliced it, I couldn&apos;t cut the mustard. My best job was being a
musician,
but eventually I found I wasn&apos;t noteworthy. I studied a long time to
become a
doctor, but I didn&apos;t have any patience. Next was a job in a shoe
factory;
I tried, but I just didn&apos;t fit in. I became a professional
fisherman,
but discovered that I couldn&apos;t live on my net income. I managed to get a good job
working for a pool maintenance company, but the work was just too
draining. So then I got a job in a
workout
center, but they said I wasn&apos;t fit for the job. After many years of trying
to find
steady work, I finally got a job as a historian...until I realized
there was no future in it. My last job was working at
Starbuck&apos;s, but I had to quit because it was always the same old grind.

 ...Today is Blueberry Popsicle Day

 Doing the furniture shuffle...
 My mission: organization. The first phase has been
accomplished. We got most of the furniture rearranged today and now I
can start putting things in their new places. (&quot;We&quot; meaning that Scott
and his friend, Tim, moved the furniture and I directed. Lyle, as I
predicted in yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram, had urgent business in St. Paul and
left at 5 this morning. He returned this afternoon, the proud owner of
a &apos;73 El Camino.) It was a big-time shuffle. We moved the HUGE
entertainment center (that I bought to use as a pantry) several times.
Moved the armoire from the bedroom and then back again. Moved the TV
stands and the storage cabinet: twice. The new &quot;pantry&quot; finally ended
up with the top half in the lower-level family room and the bottom half
(with the drawers) in the kitchen. And, finally, I emptied out the
closet in the lower-level bedroom and hauled all the &quot;valuable&quot;
contents into the middle of the family room. Lyle and Scott then
switched the old sewing table that had been stored in the garage with
the bookcase that been in the closet. It&apos;s very confusing, but I think
it&apos;s going to work out well. Now, if we had some Superman powers so we
could leap over the tall piles that need to be sorted. Where did I put
my red cape?

Our eating habits sometimes need a little shuffling, too. By moving
things around a bit, getting rid of some old habits, trying some new
foods, and adding more resolution to our dreams, we can find a
refreshing design that will give us a whole new outlook on life.

 The Grapevine 
 An ironic thing happened today during the shuffle. When I emptied
the armoire, I found the JC Penney&apos;s bag with the new pair of gray
pants I ordered a year ago. They arrived when I had my leg in a cast so
I had my friend put them in a drawer of the armoire. We never saw them
again until today, when we took a drawer out and there was the bag
wedged behind. They were to have been part of our new fall uniforms at
work last fall. The irony is that we start wearing this fall&apos;s new brown uniforms on Wednesday.

1/4 cup skim milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried, crushed
oregano leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
Dash of pepper
1 small can of mushroom pieces, drained
2 tomatoes
 
Dip the tomatoes in hot water to remove the skins. After taking out the
core, cut the tomatoes into small pieces and drain in a sieve. With a
fork, beat together all the ingredients except the mushrooms. When egg
mixture is well-beaten, fold in the mushrooms. Pour into a warm
non-stick skillet that has been sprayed with PAM. Cook over low heat.
Lift mixture from the bottom of the pan with a spatula. When half done,
fold in the tomatoes. Serve immediately. Serves 4. 136 calories per

 I was wrong...
 It&apos;s takes a big person to admit that they&apos;re wrong,
and, unfortunately, I&apos;m a big person. After looking at the JCP catalog
that just arrived; the one that I harped about yesterday, I found some
tiny print that reads: Christmas 2006. The little words
were under the BIG letters that read: unwrap
the magic . I guess the small letters got lost in the wrappings.
It wouldn&apos;t be the first time something was found missing after the
&quot;magic&quot; was unwrapped.

Some of the magic seems to have unwrapped from my daily eating and I
need to find it and bring it back. Maybe if I look in the wrappings,
I&apos;ll find it. Or what about this...maybe all the wrappings are what are
getting in the way. If I counted the wrappers, I think I&apos;d be horrified
to see just how much I&apos;m consuming. I need to journal. Gotta start
practicing what I preach. How &apos;bout you? Do you have any idea how much
food you&apos;ve eaten today...nibbles, tastes, and all?

 The Grapevine 
 No bonfire tonight. It won&apos;t seem like a Friday night without one,
but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll find things to do. I&apos;m planning on reorganizing my
migrating junk. It moves from one room to another and I&apos;m going to find
permanent homes for it. Lyle wasn&apos;t here when I got home from work, so
I&apos;m hoping he hasn&apos;t skipped town until it&apos;s all over. Should have
surprised him. 

 Tip for Today 
 Stuff it! Another way to prepare tomatoes 
There are lots of recipes out there for stuffed tomatoes. Here&apos;s how to
get the tomatoes ready for stuffing. Slice 1/2&quot; from the stem end of
the tomato. You may need to take a thin slice off the other end, too,
so that the tomato will stand upright. Scoop out the seeds and the
pulp. The shell should be about 1/4&quot; thick. Turn the tomatoes over on a
paper towel and let the juice drain out. Drain the pulp, saving it for
the stuffing, if needed. Arrange the drained tomato shells in a baking
dish. Stuff with your favorite filling and bake at 350 degrees for
20-30 minutes or until the shells are well-heated. Make a stuffing like
you would for a turkey, being creative with extra ingredients. Try
mushrooms, cottage cheese, rice and spices.

 Lena goes to the doctor for her yearly physical. The nurse
starts with the usual basic items.
&quot;How much do you weigh?&quot; the nurse asks.
&quot;115,&quot; replies Lena.
The nurse puts her on the scale. The scale reads that her weight is 145.
&quot;How tall are you?&quot; asks the nurse.
&quot;I&apos;m 5-foot 8,&quot; says Lena.
The nurse measures Lena&apos;s height and she&apos;s only 5 feet, 5 inches.
Finally, the nurse takes Lena&apos;s blood pressure and tells her it&apos;s very
high.
&quot;Of course it&apos;s high!&quot; shouts Lena. &quot;When I came in here I was tall and
slender; now I&apos;m short and fat!&quot;

 ...Today
is Eat Outside Day

 Ho! Ho! Ho!
 It&apos;s not even the 1st of September yet, and guess what
arrived at my door yesterday. Yep...the JCPenney Christmas HOLIDAY catalog. If you order by October 3rd, there&apos;s free shipping.
Wow! They evidently don&apos;t cater to procrastinators. Who ever heard of
having your Christmas shopping done by the end of September? (Oops! I
said Christmas again. That&apos;s not allowed in advertising circles
anymore. We certainly don&apos;t want to offend anyone. What about us? I&apos;m
personally offended by NOT having Christmas mentioned. But that&apos;s
another story.)

We got the BIG FALL&amp;WINTER catalog in June, so by the time it
starts getting chilly and I begin to think about warmer clothing, there
won&apos;t be any winter stock left. They&apos;ll be loading up on Spring styles. As
if life weren&apos;t speeding along fast enough as it
is, they
expect me to order
my summer things in January. 

It&apos;s no wonder there&apos;s so much stress in the world today. They&apos;re
trying to take Christ out of Christmas and out of our schools and our
government and our workplaces. They&apos;re trying to move the calendar four
months ahead. Who do &quot;they&quot; think they are? How I long for the good old
days when the Christmas lights didn&apos;t go up until after Thanksgiving
and we got five Christmas &quot;wish books&quot;---JCP, Sears, Monkey Wards,
Alden&apos;s and Spiegel&apos;s. Those
catalogs made the anticipation so much more fun. And they said CHRISTMAS on the front and you could say &quot;Merry
Christmas&quot; and nobody worried about being politically correct. 

When Scott was about 3 years old, he would sit by my Dad and they would
look at the Christmas catalogs. Dad couldn&apos;t speak because of several
strokes so Scott did the talking for both of them. All my Dad had to do
was point out his favorite thing on each page and Scott did the color
commentary. The little apple didn&apos;t fall far from the tree, because you
just read my commentary!

If JCP can change the calendar, so can I.

Merry Christmas everyone!

 Today is Eat Outside Day, but it&apos;s pretty windy...and not just here
in the Fadd Gram. Ants are usually associated with picnics, but I
haven&apos;t had to go outside to enjoy their company. The teeny tiny ones
made themselves at home on the table where I do my Faddasser stuff.
Evidently I&apos;ve been spilling bits of food, because the whole works
showed up. But then I look at it this way...whatever food they got, I
didn&apos;t. (I don&apos;t think it was enough to qualify for &quot;moderation&quot;
though.) 

 Tip for Today 
 Cucumbers...actually fruit 
Yes, we think of cucumbers as vegetables, but since they contain the
seeds for reproduction, they&apos;re considered fruit. Oh...so men are
vegetables and women fruits. :-\ ?? 
 
 FRESH CUCUMBER PICKLES 
8 cups sliced cucumbers, 1/8&quot; thick
1 cup sliced onion
2 cups sugar
1 cup vinegar
1 tablespoon celery seed
2 tablespoons salt

Slice vegetables and let drain in colander for two hours. Mix sugar,
vinegar, celery seed and salt. Pour over cucumbers in mixing bowl. Mix
well and put in jars or plastic containers with tight lids. Keep
refrigerated. Makes about two quarts.

 Note: Seems like a lot of sugar, but most of it should stay in the
juice...so eat the pickles and don&apos;t drink the juice and you&apos;ll be okay.

 Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Raymond, decide to go on a picnic. So
Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and
sandwiches. The trouble is that the picnic site is 10 miles away, so
the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. By the time they do
arrive, everyone&apos;s exhausted.

Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the
sodas and says, &quot;All right, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t bring the bottle opener,&quot; Steve says. &quot;I thought you packed
it.&quot;

Naturally, Raymond doesn&apos;t have it, so the turtles are stuck ten miles
away from home without soda.

Joe
and Steve beg Raymond to turn back home and retrieve it, but Raymond
flatly refuses, knowing that they&apos;ll eat everything by the time he gets
back. After about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Raymond to
go, swearing on their great-grand turtles&apos; graves that they won&apos;t touch
the food.

So, Raymond sets off down the road, slow and steadily.
Twenty days pass, but no Raymond. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled,
but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Raymond,
but a promise is a promise.

After three more days pass without
Raymond in sight, Steve starts getting restless. &quot;I NEED FOOD,&quot; he
yells with a hint of dementia in his voice.

&quot;NO!&quot; Joe retorts. &quot;We promised.&quot;

Five
more days pass. Joe realizes that Raymond probably skipped out to the
diner down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a
sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.

But then, right at that instant, Raymond pops out from behind a rock,
and says, &quot;Just for that, I&apos;m not going.&quot;

 ...Today
is Toasted Marshmallow Day
...Today is Red Telephone Day

 Get ready, get set...
 The last long weekend of the summer is almost upon us.
Evenings and weekends seem to be the time that we tend to stray from
moderation and healthy foods, so we need to make this a Boy Scout
Weekend and Be Prepared ! Get an early start and do your
shopping tonight or tomorrow morning. Tomorrow night and Friday night
will be wild at the grocery stores. When you walk in the front door of
the store and all the carts are gone, you know you&apos;re in trouble.
Everyone else is shopping at the same time and they&apos;re either in a
hurry or they&apos;ve parked their cart in the middle of the aisle and
they&apos;re reading all the labels. Reading labels is great...I&apos;m all for
it...but it&apos;s like using a cell phone in a car: You need to pull over
to the shoulder.

There&apos;s lots of home-grown melons and fruit available; tons of tomatoes
and still some sweet corn. Make good choices like chicken breasts
instead of hot dogs; fruit instead of rich desserts...OR...if you have
the desserts, just use moderation.

Be prepared and then you&apos;ll have a healthy and happy weekend. Get
ready; get set; and let&apos;s go!

 Can you see any smoke coming out of this Fadd Gram? I was just
interrupted by a phone call from some woman with an Indian or Pakistani
accent, who said that she was calling me because I was a senior citizen
and that my Medicare and insurance benefits would be dropped the first
of the month if I didn&apos;t get my personal card now. She said that
everyone has to have a card or their benefits will be gone. To verify
my identity, she wanted all of the information off
the bottom of my check
blanks. When I wouldn&apos;t give it to her, she told me I was going to
have to pay all future
medical bills myself since I wouldn&apos;t give her my bank information to
verify that I am who I am. Once I did that, she would give me my
personal number and the regional telephone number. I have to admit, she
was persistent and had a comeback for all my questions, but when I
absolutely refused to give her the information, she said that I would
have to take care of my own life and thank you and good-bye and CLICK.
Most of the time I know who I am and that&apos;s all that matters. I
did call the police department because, even though I hear about these
scams every day, she was a little overbearing and scary and I can
imagine what some of our senior citizens might think when they answered
the phone. I looked up Medicare Scams on the web and there&apos;s many
variations of this call.

Reminded me of Exodus 3:14: God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM. This is
what you are to say to the Israelites: &apos;I AM has sent me to you.&apos;&quot;

I know who I am, and God knows who I am, and I don&apos;t have to give Him
any account numbers!

 ...Today is Lemon Juice Day
...The first motorcycle patented on this day in 1885

 It&apos;s a lemonade day...
 This has had to be one of the best days of the summer.
Nice, cool, morning, temps in the 70s during the day, and a gentle
breeze to fan your happy face. At least that&apos;s what I felt this morning
as I left for work and then again during my noon hour. It&apos;s tough being
inside on a day like this, but a 40-below-zero day evens things out.

A good friend sent me this poem and I think it was written for a day
like this.

 A quilt and a porch swing;
a soft, gentle breeze;
some cold lemonade
from a lemon just squeezed.
a favorite old novel
to read as you please...
May the Lord give you
sweet, tranquil moments like these.

 Enjoy this lemonade day to the fullest; tomorrow it may snow. (Hey,
we&apos;re in Minnesota!)


 The Grapevine 
 By now, many of you know that the &quot;two friends in the vehicle
accident&quot; mentioned in yesterday&apos;s Fadd Gram were fellow Faddassers Bob
and Mark. Thankfully, they were not badly injured, but the van was
totaled. For those of y ou who don&apos;t think y ou have
to wear y our seat belt in town, g o look at the van .
The front end is curled around the driver&apos;s side, the new battery has a
side missing, and the glass is shattered. Had the other car hit
them a
split second later, the driver&apos;s door would have been in the
passenger&apos;s lap. They were both wearing seat
belts, or they probably
would have landed in Clara City. (17 miles to the east for you
out-of-towners.)

 L ast
mention of &quot;the accident&quot;...maybe. Bob had just filled the van with $50
worth of gas. He was already upset over the new tire being slashed and
the new battery broken, so the thought of leaving 50 bucks worth of gas
in the tank really torqued him. But,
never fear; Lyle was there. He brought down his siphon set and a car
battery to run the little electric motor. As he set it on the ground by
the gas cap, he said, &quot;Brought you an Oklahoma credit card.&quot; Bob did
smile at that, but Mark, who hadn&apos;t heard that one before, really
cracked up. (Little pun there.) 
 
I have to share else something with you. When I was typing a couple of
paragraphs above, I typed &quot;the new batter has a side missing.&quot; It would
make sense to Spell Check, but it sounds like a lonesome baseball
player to anyone else. Love that Spell Check. Now if I had a mind
check, I&apos;d be able to stay out of the home. Oh, that&apos;s right, I&apos;m
clumsy, too. Never mind.
 
 Tip for Today 
 A marinade to serenade... 
I love this marinade. It&apos;s great for the cheaper cuts of beef. Makes
them tender and tasty, whether you&apos;re broiling, roasting or grilling.

2 to 5 lb. beef roast (1 1/2&quot; thick)
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup salad oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp celery salt
Dash of pepper
1 garlic clove, minced

Mix all the ingredients together. Add meat to the marinade and let
stand 1 to 1 1/2 hours on each side. Use marinade to baste meat while
cooking. (This is an old recipe, used before the handy zip locking bags
that make marinating so easy. Also, I use garlic powder instead of the
clove; just in case Lyle would get hyper and think it&apos;s an onion!)

 The
local bar was so sure its bartender was the strongest man around that
they offered a standing $1000 bet.The bartender would squeeze a lemon
until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron.
Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the
money. Many people had tried over time, including the professional
wrestlers and bodybuilders, but nobody could do it.

One day a scrawny, little man came in, wearing a tie and a pair of
pants hiked up past his belly button. He said in a squeaky, annoying
voice, &quot;I&apos;d like to try the bet.&quot; Even the hillbilly chicks burst into
laughter.

After the laughter had died down, the bartender said, &quot;Okay,&quot; grabbed a
lemon, and squeezed away. He then handed the wrinkled remains of the
rind to the little man.

But the crowd&apos;s laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched
his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass. As the
crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man,
&quot;What did you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, weight lifter, or
what?&quot;

“No,”the man replied, &quot;I work for the IRS.&quot;

 ...Today
is ?

 What day should we celebrate?
 The Events Calendar that I use had no special days
listed for today, a rare occurrence because they come up with some real
doozies. That means we can celebrate whatever we want to. It&apos;s just
like a new day...the page is blank.

I&apos;m going to celebrate &quot;It&apos;s Great to be Alive Day.&quot;

Sometimes we don&apos;t stop to appreciate how good we have it. Every day I
hear of people I know facing new challenges in their lives. One of our
local farmers just passed away from West Nile disease, something we
think is just being hyped by the media and not really a threat. Two
friends found out this past week that their cancer was no longer in
remission and was spreading. A toddler in the area lost part of her leg
in a freak lawn mower accident. In another mower accident, an elderly
area farmer lost his life. Today two friends were in an auto accident
that totaled the vehicle they were in. Their guardian angels did their
jobs and the boys escaped with minor injuries. This
is all within the last week . 

You never know what the future holds, so live today to the fullest. We
worry too much about tomorrow and we worry about things that probably
will never happen. One step at a time; one day at a time. Our worries
are insignificant compared to losing a loved one or finding out your
cancer is terminal.

What was the toughest thing you faced today?

 Close, but no cigar
 I&apos;m still looking for the bagel/tomato recipe for
Mark. The cream cheese one was good, but not the one he remembered. I
found this on a California restaurant menu. Sounds like you would toast
the muffin, place the tomato on top, then the cheese, and broil or put
in a toaster oven.
 
 Bagel Melt 
Toasted Bagel topped with Melted Cheese&amp;Tomato. Served open-faced. 
 I also
found another recipe that would
be easier if you don&apos;t have a toaster oven. You make a regular toasted
cheese sandwich, adding a slice of tomato before you put the
buttered-side-down in the frying pan. That sounds good, too

 ...Today
is Just Because Day
...Today is Banana Lovers Day
...Today is Compassion Day

 Just Because...
 Just Because Day brings back special memories for me.
When I was young (how many times have I said that in the last 82 Fadd
Grams? I&apos;m starting to sound like my Grandma!)...when I was young, and
there was something that I really wanted, but my birthday or Christmas
was a long time away, my Mother would often buy it for me. She called
it a Because-I-Love-You present. It wasn&apos;t real often, but when it
happened, it was so great. I continued the tradition and did that for
my children. I was talking about it one day to my daughter, and she
didn&apos;t remember anything about Because-I-Love-You presents. We all have
different things that make up our memories, just as we all have
different tastes in food.

If you watched Casey and Roundhouse when you were young, or if your
children did, you will remember one of their signature songs was &quot;I
Love Onions.&quot; So do I, but I&apos;m married to a man who gets sick
even
thinking about onions in his food. We&apos;ve managed quite well. I don&apos;t
cook with onions, but he doesn&apos;t say anything when I order onions on my
hamburgers. I try to be discreet, but when you&apos;ve got part of a raw
onion ring dangling from the corner of your mouth, and you&apos;re trying to
be ladylike in shoving it back in, discreet really isn&apos;t much of an
option.

We all have different tastes in food and we need to cater to those
tastes...in moderation, of course. If you really like something, go for
it. The more you stay away from it, the stronger will be the desire for
it and the more you&apos;ll probably consume when you finally break down and
eat it. Moderation...Just because we want to be thinner.
Moderation...Just because we want to be healthier.

 One of our Faddassers is riding her bike for exercise this summer.
Her goal was to ride 1,000 this summer. She rides about 20 miles a day
and has ridden over 950 miles now. She will reach her goal, if not
already, some time this week. What an accomplishment! And it shows,
too. Great job! 

 Tip for Today 
 Start out slow... 
For some of us, there&apos;s no other option: we do everything from start to
finish &quot;slow.&quot; (Actually, it should be &quot;slowly,&quot; but there&apos;s not much
humor in &quot;slowly,&quot; and come to think of it, very little in &quot;slow.&quot; Like
the sign that reads: SLOW CHILDREN.)

If you&apos;re going to set an exercise goal, start out slowly. The old
adage, &quot;No pain, no gain,&quot; is not true. If you end up in pain, then you
haven&apos;t exercised correctly. Don&apos;t forget to stretch before you start
and drink lots of water. Our Faddasser Bike Queen didn&apos;t start out at
20 miles a day, she worked up to it. With the autumn colors beginning
to show soon, and the cooler days, it&apos;s going to be wonderful weather
for walking outside. Put on those walking shoes and enjoy God&apos;s
colorful gifts to us.

 ...Today
is Cherry Popsicle Day
...Today is Women&apos;s Equality Day

 Frozen delights...
 Popsicle is a
trademarked name for a frozen treat on a stick. The treat is commonly
known in the United Kingdom as an ice
lolly . In Australia it is known as an icy
pole . 
 
When it comes to popsicles, cherry is my favorite so I&apos;ll celebrate
today. Well, maybe not; I really like orange, too. Oh, and the grape
ones are great, if they don&apos;t melt on you. And then there&apos;s banana.
They&apos;re very good. What to choose; what to choose!

Do you know what? You don&apos;t have to choose a favorite anymore. Some
advertising exec somewhere came up with the idea of a variety pack.
What a good idea. For those who are indecisive and for those who love
them all, it&apos;s the answer. In looking back, I think I used to try and
pawn off the lime ones to the kids, but they caught on in a hurry.

During World War II, sugar and other basic foods were rationed and the
popsicles had a burnt taste. I don&apos;t know what they used for
sweeteners, but we ate them anyway. Back then, they were &quot;twin pops&quot;
and, in order to split them, you had to get just the right grip on the
package so you could break them apart. Sometimes they broke unevenly
and you lucked out and got your half and part of the other. Now they
have the single pops so everything&apos;s fair and square.

Calories are only about 70, but the nutritional value is only
carbohydrates. It&apos;s a cooling treat on a hot day. So...what&apos;s your
&quot;flavorite?&quot;

 Tip for Today 
 Break the fast; break the monotony... 
If you&apos;re skipping breakfast, you&apos;re not eating to promote good health.
Breakfast is just what it says: it&apos;s breaking the fast that you&apos;ve been
on while sleeping. It&apos;s usually 10 hours or so since you&apos;ve eaten. Skip
breakfast and it could be 15-16 hours of fasting. That is very
confusing to the survival part of the brain. Ever had a breakfast
salad? Try this.

Make a dressing of apple cider vinegar, a little olive oil, and a
splash of maple syrup. Mix well and dribble over a salad of greens
tossed with chopped Canadian bacon and chopped pecans. It makes a light
meal any time of the day...even breakfast!

Ole asked Lena to help him shed some unwanted pounds so she stopped
serving fattening TV snacks and substituted crisp celery.

While he was unenthusiastically munching on a celery stalk one night, a

 Squash those zucchini rumors... 
 Low-cal Apple-Zucchini Pie 
3 cups peeled and thinly-sliced apples
1 1/2 cups pared, cored and thinly-sliced zucchini
1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 cup sugar

 ...Today is Waffle Day
...Today is Can Opener Day

 A can can open problems...
 One of the handiest tools to ever hit the pike is the
can opener. A few twists of the wrist and you have instant food. It&apos;s
not quite so necessary with today&apos;s frozen food products and the new
pouch products as it was a few years ago, but nevertheless, it&apos;s a
well-used kitchen utensil.

Did you now that the blade on a can opener is probably the dirtiest
place in your kitchen? The food stays on the blade and, hopefully,
dries before it contaminates the next can you open. So...don&apos;t forget
to clean that blade!

As far as a pouch product, I have one of my own, but not for long.
Pouch products are designed to last a long time. Mine did, but it&apos;s on
the way out.

Read the label before you buy the product . .
Sodium makes up a large part of canned food and if you&apos;re watching your
blood pressure, that&apos;s not good. Buy low-sodium foods. That&apos;s another
of my pet peeves. Why does it always cost more to get less?
Low-sodium/no-sodium products cost more than those with the salt added.
Fat-free is not free when compared to the same product with the fat
left in it. Hard to understand. Eating less salt isn&apos;t. Watch your
sodium intake.

 Tip for Today 
Marinated Vegetables
Here is a marinade for fresh vegetables. Use as many different kinds as
you want. Chop them up and add a can of drained mushrooms. Put them in
a large bowl.

 Vegetable Marinade 
1 1/2 cups wine vinegar
1 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
2 tsp. dried oregano, crushed
2 tsp. dried tarragon, crushed
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup vegetable oil

In a saucepan, heat vinegar and stir in sugar, salt and pepper. Cool
slightly and add oils. Mix well. Pour dressing over the vegetables,
stir, and refrigerate 24 hours. Drain before serving. That will get rid
of a good share of the oils.

 Food on the run can kill like a gun
 Drivers with cell phones glued to their ears drive me
crazy. Now I&apos;m starting to cringe when I see a driver chomping away on
food while driving. I&apos;ve had several close calls in the last two weeks
and the drivers didn&apos;t seem to even know I was there. One time the
driver was so busy craning his neck to see something that he almost hit
me broadside. The other times, the drivers were concentrating on either
opening food containers or shoving the food into their mouths, without
spilling on themselves. So why am I not visible? It&apos;s
not that I&apos;m so skinny you can&apos;t see me if I&apos;m standing sideways; I&apos;m
still in women&apos;s sizes. It&apos;s not that I drive a little economy car; my
Buick Park Avenue is a big car. Could it be that you can&apos;t concentrate
on your driving when you&apos;re using one hand or your knees to steer,
while trying to lean so you don&apos;t spill on yourself? Duh! 
 
I&apos;m not saying I&apos;ve never eaten while driving; I&apos;d be lying through my
teeth if I did, because it wasn&apos;t too long ago that I mentioned eating
toast in the car on the way to work. (That is, I&apos;d be lying through my
teeth, if they weren&apos;t full of toast.) After watching other drivers
jeopardize traffic and lives, I&apos;ve decided maybe I&apos;m worth more than a
few chicken nuggets. Besides, we Faddassers are eating less, but
enjoying it more. It&apos;s hard to savor the flavor while you&apos;re trying to
steer and eat at the same time. Both
food-on-the-run and a gun, when used carelessly, can be lethal. 
 
My new plan is:: If you don&apos;t have time to sit at a table and eat
it, you don&apos;t need it. 

Here&apos;s a great website describing eating different foods while driving.
I recommend it. http://www.dietitian.com/danger.html

 Yesterday I accidentally sent out a memo to all four of our Credit
Union offices when I only meant to send it to the staff in the Monte
office. It was someone&apos;s birthday and the person who brought the treats
said they were &quot;chocolaty things&quot; so I was letting everyone know they
were in the lunch room. Got an e-mail from a Faddasser in one of the
other offices that said, &quot;Thanks a lot. I&apos;m sitting here eating
cucumbers and salad and you&apos;re talking about &apos;chocolaty things.&apos; I&apos;m
not that crazy about chocolate, but it sounds pretty good right now.&quot;
And then a second \memo, &quot;Oh, yes, and three wheat thins.&quot;

Eating healthy is good. Chocolaty things are okay, if you remember
moderation and don&apos;t get carried away.

 ...Today is Be An Angel Day
...Today is Tooth Fairy Day
...Today is Eat a Peach Day

 Put them under your pillow...
 Today is Tooth Fairy Day. Remember when you wiggled
and jiggled your little baby teeth, trying to see if they were any
looser? The faintest movement brought joy to your heart because once
you lost your tooth, you could put it under your pillow and the next
morning the Tooth Fairy, who arrived in the dark of night, would have
left money in exchange for the tooth. Personally, when I think back on
it, I&apos;m amazed that I wasn&apos;t scared out of my wits. Just the thought of
someone prowling around my room in the dark and shuffling teeth and
money under my pillow...while I&apos;m sleeping on the pillow...gives me the
willies. Inflation has hit the Tooth Fairy big time. I got a dime and
thought I
was rich. Sixty years later, the minimum is a dollar and it goes
upwards to ten dollars.

So why isn&apos;t there a Fat Fairy when we need her? I&apos;d like to put a few
empty butter boxes under my pillow and get some money for the fat I&apos;ve
lost. That would be an incentive! Hey...I&apos;ve got a better idea...why
not put the stuff under the scale? I&apos;m going to have to google a little
bit and see if there might be a Fat Fairy out there hiding somewhere.
We could use her!

Let&apos;s adapt the Tooth Fairy routine to our Faddasser eating. When you
go to bed at night, put all your eating problems under your pillow and
forget about them. In the morning, you can start a new day without
them... just leave them under there. Eventually, when you launder the
bedding, they would wash away.

Itemize your problems by writing them down. The list will
help you know what you need to work on. Then
put the list under your pillow and go to sleep. (It&apos;s probably best not
to count sheep; you might get hungry for lamb chops!)

Sweet dreams!

 Two of our Faddassers stopped into the Credit Union today. They
stepped up to my desk, and the older one asked me, &quot;Do you have a

It&apos;s been cream-can week and everyone&apos;s been bringing change in for us
to count so, helpful receptionist that I
am, I replied, &quot;Yes, we
do!&quot; 
 
The shorter guy then said, &quot;Okay, I&apos;d like to be taller and thinner.&quot;

The other guy said, &quot;I&apos;m okay with my height, but I&apos;d sure like to lose
my belly.&quot;

(I walked right into it!)
 
 Tip for Today 
 Acid or toxic? Could be both. 
Several hundred years ago, tomatoes were thought to be poisonous.
People with money had plates made of pewter. Tomatoes have a high acid
content and caused some of the lead in the pewter to leach into the
food. This &quot;lead&quot; to what we know today as lead poisoning and,
eventually, death. After 400 years of being feared, it&apos;s only been the
last 100 years or so that tomatoes have come back into our diets.

Today&apos;s tip: Eat lots of tomatoes...but not on pewter.

 ...Today is Scrape the Bugs Day

 Scraping...
 Scrapings can be loaded with calories. No, I don&apos;t
mean scraping bugs. Hopefully, you have enough sense to not eat the
bugs. (Although, I must admit that, if done right, bugs dipped in
chocolate aren&apos;t all that bad!) I mean scraping plates and scraping
pans. When you cook, it&apos;s often habit to get a rubber scraper and clean
the pan out. The object, I expect, is to get every last bit so the food
isn&apos;t wasted, but more often than not, the scraper is detoured to your
mouth instead of the bowl. That last little bite is the tastiest
bite
of all.

How many people make slurping noises with their straws as they try to
suck up that last little droplet out of the bottom of the glass? It&apos;s
the best part. And what about clearing the table? When
you&apos;re &quot;family,&quot; there&apos;s no stigma about eating off a family member&apos;s
plate. Why let those choice morsels go into the garbage? Waste not,
want not, so why not send them directly to your waist? Have you ever
thought about all the little &quot;don&apos;t-count-bites&quot; of food that you
consume in an average day?

It&apos;s time to think about it. Little things count up. It only takes one
small step to start on a thousand-mile journey. Let that small step be
to the garbage disposal or the garbage can. If you feel there are too
many leftovers, then maybe it&apos;s time to downsize your cooking. For a
lot of us, a refrigerator full of leftovers is like the &quot;Field of
Dreams&quot;...you fill it and &quot;they&quot; will come...and &quot;they&quot; will probably
be you.

Watch out for the little things and the big things will disappear.

 Tip for Today 
 Tomato season is here! 
 Don&apos;t store tomatoes in the
refrigerator: They lose their taste when refrigerated and become mushy.
Place them on a rack on your windowsill, if you have one, so the air
can move around them.

Another easy way to serve tomatoes is to just slice
them thick and drizzle with olive oil and a bit of salt and fresh
pepper. You can get pepper in disposable grinders now so there&apos;s no
excuse to use old pepper.

 ...Today is Lemonade Day

 76 days; 76 trombones&apos; 76?...
 We&apos;re
watching Day
76 of our journey drop into the
sunset and slide over the horizon. My first thought when I hear
seventy-six is &quot;76 Trombones,&quot; from the musical &quot;The Music Man.&quot; Once
you think of the song, it&apos;s almost impossible to keep from humming it
over and over and over in your mind. Repetition can be a good thing if
it isn&apos;t beating a rhythm on your brain cells. Remember when we talked
about repetition in the first days of our journey? It&apos;s said that is
you do something for 21 days, it will have become a habit.

We want to develop good habits. We want to eat smaller
portions; we want to eat healthy foods; we want to exercise. All of
these things can become good habits if we do them on a daily basis.
We&apos;re getting so wrapped up in our initial weight loss that we&apos;re
forgetting about the rest of the journey. In today&apos;s sermon, Pastor Bob
used the example of traveling with small children and the ever-popular
question, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;

We&apos;re not there yet. We&apos;ve hardly gotten past the city limits. This is
the journey of a lifetime. Let&apos;s watch the signs along the way and keep
on the path to health. We don&apos;t want to have to use &quot;wide load&quot; signs
and we will, if we disobey the &quot;No U-Turn&quot; sign and return to our old
habits.

 Tomato, tomahto... 
The tomatoes are ripening and it&apos;s time to enjoy them. They make a

cheese or egg salad. Slice them, dice them; chew them, stew them. Just
enjoy them.

Tomato facts: 
 
 Tomatoes are lipophilic, which means
their nutritional value is increased by being cooked in some fat. Cooked tomatoes may be more
beneficial to your health than raw tomatoes. Tomatoes are rich in vitamins (A, C
Calcium) and fiber. Tomatoes are rich in Lycopene, one
of nature&apos;s most powerful antioxidants. It is found
almost exclusively in tomatoes. There may also be an association
between heart health and tomatoes.

 The best part of waking up...
 The best part of waking up is turning over and going
back to sleep. I LOVE Saturday mornings! Other mornings, I have to rise
and shine. I rise, but there&apos;s no way that I shine. I&apos;m not a shiny
person; not a morning person, I guess, but once I&apos;m up, I&apos;m okay. It
doesn&apos;t matter if I have to get up early or late...I push it to the
limit and then hurry to catch up.

Our eating in moderation is a lot like getting up in the morning.
Sometimes you want to say, &quot;I&apos;m going to roll over and forget about it
for today.&quot; Other times, you make yourself get up, so to speak, and
follow the program. Once you&apos;re doing it, things work out just fine.
Getting started, for a lot of us, is the problem. If you don&apos;t get
started, you&apos;ll have wasted a lot of valuable time and will have to
hurry to catch up.

 Tip for Today 
 Potato, potahto...they both taste the same 
There seems to be a myth that potatoes are fattening. Not so, if you
use moderation. A medium potato (about 4 oz.) has only 88 calories.
It&apos;s the toppings you add to it or the way it&apos;s prepared that boosts
the calories.

Baked potatoes are easy to prepare and very good. One pat of butter is
36 calories, and who stops at one pat? Sour cream is about 30 calories
for a tablespoon. It&apos;s fine to use them. Just be aware of the portions
so you don&apos;t overdo it. Another
choice: Use
salt and pepper and spray it with I-Can&apos;t-Believe-It&apos;s-Not-Butter. Or
make the sour cream from cottage cheese, like we suggested a couple
days ago. 
 
Fry potatoes in lots of oil or add mayonnaise to potato salad and
you&apos;ll add enough fat to put your arteries in shock.

...Today is Sand Castle Day

 Sand Castles...
 Sand castles are a lot of work, but so much fun. You
sit in the damp sand and pat the parts into place. If you&apos;re by the
ocean, you can sniff the pungent smell of seaweed and hear the hypnotic
sounds of the waves as they roll into shore in monotonous rows. If
you&apos;re by the lake, you can inhale the fragrance of dead carp and watch
the still, green water. In your own private sandbox? You are surrounded
by the fragrance of newly mown grass and the neighbor&apos;s barbecue smoke.
It&apos;s a lazy time and you forget that soon the tide will come in or the
rain will fall and your sand castle will melt away.

Remember the old Sunday School song about the wise man who built his
house upon a rock and the foolish man who built his house on the sand?
There were wonderful motions with it. You could trickle your fingers so
they looked like rain coming down and then you could thrust your palms
upward and almost see the water rising. It was a fun song, but it had
more to it than just the motions. The choice was a no-brainer. You knew
that you needed the rock. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if the answers to our
other decisions were so easy to see?

We build a lot of personal sand castles in our lives and then are
disappointed when they wash away. After awhile, we should begin to get
the message. It doesn&apos;t work to build your hopes on sand. It&apos;s
wonderful to dream, but you need the solid rock to anchor you to
reality. Jesus is that rock. Build your hopes on Him and the rains can
come down and the floods come up, but you will be safe.

I should have saved this for my devotional this week, but today is Sand
Castle Day. Don&apos;t build your eating habits on a fad diet either. When
it&apos;s washed away, you&apos;ll be back where you started. Use moderation and
eat healthy foods and you&apos;ll have a solid foundation.

Amen.

better than descending?)
 
 Tip for Today 
 Experiment and try something different... 
We had frozen turkey mignon fillets in the freezer so I made a roaster
of dressing and put them on top to bake. I used our family&apos;s old secret
recipe for stuffing: Kellogg&apos;s Stuffing Mix. The package calls for
chicken broth and a half cup of butter. I heated the broth, but
substituted applesauce for the butter. We&apos;ll see how it tastes and let
you know tomorrow. I&apos;ve very seldom tasted a stuffing I didn&apos;t like.
It&apos;s my favorite part of Thanksgiving.

 The Ups and Downs of Life...
 Today is Roller Coaster Day. If that doesn&apos;t describe
life, I don&apos;t know what does! Sometimes it goes so fast that I want to
yell, &quot;Just let me off!&quot;. Other times, the exhilaration takes my breath
away. We never know from day to day if we&apos;re approaching a peak or a
valley. Life would be dull without these little surprises. &quot;The secret
is keep the valleys from becoming Grand Canyons.&quot; (Bern Williams) It&apos;s
not until you&apos;re in the valley that you will appreciate the peaks. 
 
This quote is mind boggling.
&quot;Search for the seed of good in every adversity. Master that principle
and you will own a precious shield that will guard you well through all
the darkest valleys you must traverse. Stars may be seen from the
bottom of a deep well when they cannot be discerned from the
mountaintop. So will you learn things in adversity that you would never
have discovered without trouble. There is always a seed of good. Find
it and prosper.&quot; --- Og Mandino (American essayist and psychologist,
1923-1996)

 As Faddassers, we have ups and downs in
our eating. Remember that each day is a new beginning and you can start
over and do better. Do
your best; let God do the rest.

 Got some more input. One of our Faddassers lost 12 pounds since July
17th. Isn&apos;t that wonderful? We&apos;re proud of you. Keep up the good work

 FRIDAY NIGHT BONFIRE ...For the &quot;regulars&quot; and anyone who wants
to join us, the David Buchanan family is hosting
the bonfire this week. Their daughter, Nina, is in a play at the Fine
Arts Center. The curtain goes up at 6 PM. The bonfire will start
about 7 PM at their farm. If you&apos;re from the area, it&apos;s the old Gippe place
located about half-way between Montevideo and Watson.

If you&apos;d like to join us and don&apos;t know the way, just contact me for
directions. If you&apos;re a guy and don&apos;t want to ask for directions, pass
this on to a woman. We&apos;re not shy about finding our way. Or e-mail me.
I won&apos;t tell. Maybe. 
 
Tip for Today 
 Brush, brush, brush. Gargle, gargle, gargle 
You&apos;ve just eaten a full meal (in moderation, of course) and you still
crave something sweet. Before you jump into the cookie jar, brush your
teeth and gargle. That may take the craving away. It also will make you
think twice about getting sugar on your newly brushed choppers.

 Ole
and Lena were on their way to Valley Fair for their first roller
coaster ride. They were very excited and couldn&apos;t wait to get there.
When they got close to the amusement park, they saw a sign that read:
Valley Fair left.

So they turned around and went home. (Talk about disappointment!)

...Best Friend&apos;s Day

 Best friends...
 Lael and I have been friends since 1949. She and I met
in District 40 country school near Onamia, Minnesota. We only lived
there for another three years, but in that short time Lael and I
developed a life-time friendship. That&apos;s unusual in grade school, where
your best friend can often change on a daily basis.

It&apos;s not that we see each other that often or talk regularly. We just
know that the other is there and if we want to talk, we take can right
up where we left off. This quote pretty much sums up our friendship. &quot; Together forever, never apart.
Maybe in distance, but never in heart.&quot; We
usually communicate on birthdays and try to get together once a year.
Unfortunately, that hasn&apos;t happened for a couple of years, but it&apos;s
something I intend to do this fall.

Do you have a friend you haven&apos;t seen or talked with in a long time? Do
you have a friend you talk with often? If you have friends, you have
wealth...a wealth that money can&apos;t buy. Why not celebrate Best Friend&apos;s
Day and contact some of those friends? It will brighten their day and
it will lift your spirits. Being happy is good for your heart and good
for your health.

 The Grapevine 
 I asked for results and got quite a few responses. Here are some of
them.
 
 I hit a new low (in weight)
at the end of last week and am getting into clothes that are a size
smaller.
 Since I get the Fadd Grams, I
have lost 5 lbs. Before that I was trying for about one month and I had
lost 5 pounds also, but it seems like I am losing a little faster with
the pep talk I get from the Fadd Gram. I have been trying to have the
attitude that if I lose slow that is okay as I am learning a new way to
live, not just going on a diet. I have lost 14
lbs. I started keeping track on Mondays. I still have more
than an
inch to pinch. Hey Jean, I just wanted to
respond. I&apos;m down 20 lbs. as of yesterday. I
really enjoy your e-mails. You give me a lot of inspiration. Thanks!
 
 It&apos;s so
nice to hear from you. I send
out a lot of e-mail and it just seems to go into the great beyond and
there is no response. I want to shout, &quot;Is anybody out there?&quot; I&apos;m glad
the Fadd Grams are helping. I&apos;ve lost 20 pounds, too. It doesn&apos;t seem
like we&apos;ve been doing this for over two months.

Keep up the good work!
 
 Tip for Today 
 Call in the subs 
By using healthy substitutions, you can eliminate a lot of calories.
Here a two examples.
...Substitute 1/4 pound lean ham for 1/4 pound bacon and you&apos;ll save
480 calories
...You&apos;re making muffins and the recipe calls for 1 cup of oil.
Substitute 1/2 cup applesauce
  plus 1/2 cup of oil and you&apos;ll knock off almost 900
calories.

 ..Today is Monday

 Mondays aren&apos;t so bad...
 Couldn&apos;t find anything worthwhile for &quot;Today
is...&quot; Today is just Monday. Did you know Monday got its name from the moon?
For a lot of people, Monday is the start of a new work week; or the
beginning of another school week. Monday has always had kind of a bad
rap. It&apos;s been called Blue Monday. There are songs like Rainy Days
and Mondays Always Get Me Down . Solomon Grundy was born on Monday.
Nothing real positive. That is, until 1970, when ABC added &quot;Monday
Night Football&quot; to its programming.

 Tonight
is the first game of the season and it
features our own Minnesota Vikings vs. the Oakland Raiders. Randy Moss,
past hero of the Vikes, is now their Nemesis, and everyone is waiting
to see how he plays against his old team. Game starts at 7 PM on ESPN. Last
year was the final year on ABC. 
 
Just a reminder that it is not mandatory to eat and drink while
watching football. There will be those who disagree, but I cannot find
anything in the NFL rules that state you must have a beer in one hand
and potato chips in the other. It&apos;s easy to get lost in the excitement
and not realize how much you&apos;re eating. The faster the action, the
faster you shovel in the snacks. On the other hand, if the game is slow
and boring, the only excitement there is will probably involve food.
Just have some healthy snacks on hand and you&apos;ll still enjoy the game.
And tomorrow, when you weigh in, you won&apos;t have the morning-after
blues. (Not to be confused with Blue Monday.)

Go Vikings! Go Faddassers! Eat healthy! Eat in moderation!

 The Grapevine 
 We would really like to find out how this is working for you. If you
have a minute, will you reply to this e-mail and let us know how much
you&apos;ve lost and how it&apos;s going? I won&apos;t mention any names, unless you
want me to. 

 Tip for Today 
 Most dips start with sour cream 
If you have a recipe for a snack dip, it probably starts out with sour
cream. Here&apos;s a healthier substitute.
 Mock Sour Cream 
2 cups low-fat cottage cheese
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup skim milk
Use a blender or processor to mix the cottage cheese and lemon juice
until it&apos;s creamy. Add skim milk to desired consistency. Add your
favorite seasons.

 Calorie
Myth: Food on toothpicks, like sausages, cocktail franks, cheese and
the like, are all fattening unless impaled on frilled toothpicks. The
insertion of a sharp object allows the calories to leak out the bottom.

Day 69 
 ...Today is Left-Handers Day

 The best laid plans...
 Robert Burns had it right when he said the best laid
plans often go awry. The good thing is that we&apos;re adaptable. At least
most of us are. If you aren&apos;t, you will find life to be quite a trial.
The heavy rains in our area made our Block Party&apos;s Sunday schedule take
a few unplanned-for turns, but we adapted. The Town Hall hosted the
community church service and the dinner. It wasn&apos;t all that we had
hoped for, but on the other hand, we needed rain badly so it was a
small sacrifice on our part. (I can say that since I wasn&apos;t feeling
well and stayed home from the festivities today.) For those who hauled
food and equipment back and forth between the church grounds and town
hall, it was a lot of work, but they got it done. Good job!

You&apos;ll find that your menu plans don&apos;t always work out for the best,
but you need to adapt and get on with it. One or two meals isn&apos;t the
end of the world and you can compensate for it when you&apos;re back on
track. As I keep saying, &quot;Do the best you can and let God do the rest.&quot;


 The Grapevine 
 We have some Scottish Faddassers out there who will probably remind
me that my Robby Burns quote isn&apos;t exact. It should read The
best-laid schemes o&apos; mice an &apos;men gang aft agley. I simplified
it a bit. Gang aft agley isn&apos;t an
everyday phrase for most Minnesotans.
Simple or not, it&apos;s a lovely poem and an apt thought. Plans do go
awry.

For all the left-handers out there...enjoy your day! My husband and
both kids are lefties. I keep telling them I&apos;m the only normal one in
the family.

Ever seen three people roll their eyes in unison?
 
 Tip for Today 
 A Scottish vegetable dish... 
 Clapshot 
(Potatoes, Carrots&amp;Rutabaga)
 This is a very intriguing dish. The flavours blend so well it is
hard to identify any one of the components; instead it seems like some
new, mysterious veggie. 
 1
lb white potatoes 
 1
lb carrots 
 1
lb rutabagas 
 3
tablespoons butter 
 1
teaspoon salt 
   pepper 
 1
egg (optional) 
 6
servings; 50 minutes; 10 minutes prep
 
 Peel the rutabagas and cut into thin slices. Put slices in a large pot with plenty of water and
bring it to a boil. Meanwhile, peel the carrots and cut them in thick
slices. When the
rutabaga has been cooking for about 10 minutes, add the carrots. Peel the potatoes, and cut them into large chunks. When the rutabaga has been cooking for 20 minutes
(total), add the potatoes, and cook for about another 20 minutes. When all the vegetables are tender, drain them and
mash them with the butter, salt and pepper.
 
 These
are delicious mashed somewhat coarsely and served as-is.You can also
purée them very well, beat in the egg, and turn them into a
buttered
casserole dish, then bake them until lightly toasted on top.

 ...Today is Thank
You Day
...Today is Romance Day
...Today is Middle Children&apos;s Day
...Today is International Youth Day

 Thank You Day...
 Thank You Day came
at an opportune time. We had our
huge rummage sale today. Two big-top tents lined with tables and
furniture. It was a huge undertaking and it took the help of a lot of
people to pull it off, so Thank You Day seems appropriate.

It&apos;s amazing how people can work
together when they put their minds to
it. We like to think it&apos;s a Minnesota thing, but it happens all over
the world when disaster strikes or the need is there. Wouldn&apos;t it be
nice if the world could continue to help each other and work together
for the common good all the time? How God would smile then to see his
children &quot;doing unto others...&quot;

As Faddassers, we&apos;re working together
for the good of each of us. Good
job! Thank you.

 The Grapevine 
 Like most rummage sales, we came home with more than we brought, but
they were SUCH BARGAINS! How could we resist? We are now the proud
owners of four queen-size bedspreads. I bought two and then Lyle came
over and said he thought we should buy a couple more because surely
someone could use them.

Tonight is the FREE MOVIE in Watson. We&apos;re going to sit outside and
watch &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; and have popcorn and soda. The whole community
is invited, so it should be a fun thing.
 
 Tip for Today 
 Have some old-fashioned family fun
tomorrow 
The fun in Watson doesn&apos;t end
tonight. Tomorrow there is a community
church service at 10 AM under the big-top. At 11:30 we&apos;ll start serving
the hog roast menu: roast pork sandwiches, homemade baked beans, corn
on the cob, lemonade or coffee, and a dessert.

From 12:30 to 3:00 PM there will be
carnival games, followed by
Christian music. The music lasts from 3:00 - 6:00 PM and then we will
have a grand finale with an old-fashioned tent meeting. There&apos;s
activities all day long so join us if you can.

 A couple had two
mischievous young boys, ages 8 and 10. They were always getting into
trouble,
and their parents knew that if any mischief occurred in their town,
their sons would get the blame.

The boys&apos; mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in
disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.
The clergyman agreed and asked to see them individually.

So, the mother sent her 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the
older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.

The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy
down and asked him sternly, &quot;Where is God?&quot;

They boy&apos;s mouth dropped open, but he made no response, he just sat
there with his mouth hanging open.

The clergyman repeated the question. &quot;Where is God?&quot;

Again, the boy made no attempt to answer.

So the clergyman raised his voice some more and shook his finger in the
boy&apos;s face and bellowed, &quot; Where is God !?&quot;

The boy screamed and bolted from the room. He ran directly home and
dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.

When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, &quot;What
happened?&quot;

The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied: &quot;We are in real BIG
trouble this time! God is missing, and they think we did it!&quot;

 ...Today

Hello...goodbye
 Aloha! What a great word. It means &quot;hello&quot; and it
means &quot;goodbye.&quot; You don&apos;t have to know whether you&apos;re coming or
going...aloha covers it all. I&apos;m thinking about using it as my greeting
at the Credit Union. I had to quit saying, &quot;Good morning, Credit Union&quot;
and &quot;Good afternoon, Credit Union&quot; because I would often say the PM in
the AM or vice versa. Now I just say, &quot;Credit Union. This is Jean.&quot; I
wonder what our members would say if I answered the phone, &quot;Aloha,
Co-op Credit Union.&quot; Probably &quot;uffda.&quot;

We Faddassers are on an aloha journey. We&apos;re saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; to the
extra pounds and &quot;Hello&quot; to a healthier way of eating. I&apos;m going to
start using that word more so don&apos;t be surprised if someone says,
&quot;Aloha&quot; to you. It will be me ...I?

 Many of you live in the Montevideo/Watson area. If you do, don&apos;t
miss the big Block Party put on by the Evangelical Church in Watson.
The rummage sale is under the big top next to the church and starts at
8 AM tomorrow morning. There&apos;s tons of beautiful furniture, bedspreads,
drapes, bedding and pillows. The bed pillows are polyester and are only
a quarter each...and they&apos;re nice and clean. The two big tents are full
of our treasures at almost give-away prices. We&apos;re also serving coffee
and rolls so why not join us? 

 Tip for Today 
 Grilled Pineapple 
 
 1
large ripe pineapple
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon or lime
juice
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 

 Trim,
core, and peel pineapple. Cut into
quarters from top to
bottom. Slice out the core from each quarter. Cut each quarter slice
into four pieces (two pieces lengthwise and two crosswise). You should
now have 12 wedges of pineapple (about 3-inch by 1-inch each). 

 In a
small bowl, combine honey, lemon or lime
juice, and
black pepper. Brush the glaze onto each slice of pineapple, coating
completely. 

 Preheat
barbecue grill. Either oil or spray
the grill rack
with non-stick cooking spray. Place pineapple wedges on the grill and
cook approximately 4 minutes on each side (turning so that grill marks
are on all sides) until the pineapple becomes fragrant and starts to
dry out on the surface. NOTE: Don&apos;t overcook, or they&apos;ll turn mushy. 

 Remove
from the grill and brush with any
additional glaze one
more time. Serve and enjoy!

 A man was walking along the beach and found a bottle. He looked around
and didn&apos;t see anyone, so he opened it.

A genie appeared and thanked the man for letting him out. The genie
said, &quot;For your kindness I will grant you one wish, but only one.&quot;

The man thought for a minute and said, &quot;I have always wanted to go to
Hawaii, but have never been able to because I&apos;m afraid of flying and
ships make me claustrophobic and ill. So I wish for a road to be built
from here to Hawaii.&quot;

The genie thought for a few minutes and said, &quot;No, I don&apos;t think I can
do that. Just think of all the work involved with the pilings needed to
hold up the highway and how deep they would have to be to reach the
bottom of the ocean. Think of all the pavement that would be needed.
No, that is just too much to ask.&quot;

The man thought for a minute and then told the genie, &quot;There is one
other thing that I have always wanted. I would like to be able to
understand women. What makes them laugh and cry? Why are they
temperamental? Why are they sometimes so difficult to get along with?
Basically,
what makes them tick?&quot;

 Day 66
 One man&apos;s junk is another man&apos;s treasure...
 This morning I helped get the rummage sale ready for
the big Watson Evangelical Church Block Party. Talk about treasures. We
have them. Procrastinator that I am, I waited until this morning and
then went through the house and grabbed things we hadn&apos;t used in
several (how about 30?) years and loaded them up in the pickup. Yes,
for 30 years I&apos;ve been going to refinish an antique drop-leaf table
that is solid oak. It hurts to part with it because I can envision how
nice it will look, but it&apos;s time to get real. If I haven&apos;t done
anything with it in 30 years and I&apos;m 66 years old, the odds of it
getting refinished by my liver-spotted hands are very low. Although I&apos;m
hurting a little about the table, I have a good feeling because I&apos;m
getting rid of some of our other clutter. We live in a town house and
I&apos;m running out of room to put all these treasures. I used to think I&apos;d
&quot;save them for the kids,&quot; but when I&apos;ve mentioned giving them one or
two of my valuables, the looks on their faces said it all. It&apos;s going
to be one big rummage sale when I&apos;m gone. But, by that time, I won&apos;t
care. (There will be new treasures in heaven that I can stash
away...for eternity!)

Life is a lot like that. We have so much clutter that we can&apos;t get to
the good things in our lives. As Faddassers, we&apos;re decluttering our
bodies by getting rid of excess pounds and we&apos;re declogging our
arteries by eating healthier. And I&apos;m driving the spell checker nuts
with words like declog and declutter. Let&apos;s continue to get rid of the
excess baggage...the clutter in our lives...and live each day to the
fullest. God has given us so much to enjoy that it will take a
lifetime. Better get started.

 The Grapevine 
 Faddasser Bob told me today that he has had an expensive suit
hanging in his closet for several years because it was too small. Last
night he took it out to see if he was getting closer to fitting into
it. Imagine his dismay when he found that moths had eaten tiny holes up
and down the sleeves. So while he was NOT eating, the moths were. 

 Tip for Today 
 If it doesn&apos;t fit, get rid of it 
We all have clothing in our closets that we&apos;re saving because we hope
it will fit again some day. Don&apos;t wait until the moths beat you to it,
get rid of it. Give it to someone who can use it while it&apos;s still in
good shape. When you reach that goal, pamper yourself and go get
something new. I know they say, &quot;What goes around, comes around,&quot; but
when it comes around again, fashion has a way of making it just a
little bit different. Just enough so you look dorky in your retro
outfit. Close only counts in horseshoes and it definitely doesn&apos;t count
in fashion. Clean out those closets.

 Oops! I hit it again...
 Remember when I said I was clumsy? Well, I&apos;ve decided
it sounds better to say that I&apos;m dexterity challenged. (Dexterity:
Skill in use of hands or body.) Yes, another little bump in the road of
my life. Well, actually, it was quite a large bump for awhile.

You see, yesterday morning I got out of the shower and prepared to do
my weekly weigh-in. Dripping wet and buck naked, I caught a glimpse of
myself in the full-length mirror on the back of the bathroom door and
almost let out a shriek. Who was that fat lady in my bathroom!! I
turned my back on her and stepped on the scale. As I told you before, I
bought a new digital scale so my old eyes could read the numbers. My
belly seemed to be blocking the numbers, so I bent forward, the better
to see, you see, and slammed my head into the end of the wooden towel
rack. I&apos;m like the little girl in the nursery rhyme, only instead of a
curl in the middle of my forehead, I&apos;ve got swelling.

Now I&apos;m wondering if a swelling can make you weigh more. If I&apos;d have
been able to see the scale before I hit the wall, I could have
told you. On the brighter side, the place mats at Trailways Cafe have a
trivia section that says you burn quite a few calories hitting your
head against the wall...so maybe it was exercise after all!


 The Grapevine 
 One of our Faddassers spent a few hot days down at the Brickyard 400
in Indianapolis. He lost a lot of weight by lots of walking, sweating,

now she&apos;s got the cleanest ulcers in the land.&quot; I f
you want to know more, I think I still have the sheet music for it some
place. That
really has nothing
to do with the Tip for Today, but I wanted to show off my memory for
lyrics.

If you aren&apos;t losing as much as you think you should be, maybe it&apos;s
time to journal for a week. Just make little notes of all the food you
eat in a day. Even the little snacks you grab on the run. You will
probably be surprised at how much you&apos;ve consumed. Once you know where
the problem is, then you can figure out how to remedy it. Remember,
we&apos;re all &quot;above-average intelligence and real good lookin&apos;.&quot;
We can do it.

 ...Today
is Cheesecake Day
...Today is Happiness Happens Day
...This is Smile Week

 Happiness DOES happen...
 What
a positive thought. Happiness happens. It happens all the time;
every day. It&apos;s just that we don&apos;t always know happiness when we have
it. Have you ever looked for something and, in frustration, asked your
spouse or someone else to help you look? They give a little laugh,
point right in front of you, and there it is...in full view. It&apos;s so
exasperating to know that it was, actually, &quot;right under your nose.&quot;
Or, as your Mother would have told you, &quot;If it had been a snake, it
would have bitten you.&quot;

I think happiness is a lot like that. We don&apos;t know what we have until
we lose it. Then we realize what happiness really was...that it was
right there in front of us all the time.

On the flip-side of the coin, our weight is right there in full
view...under our nose. We&apos;ll know even more happiness when we lose it
(our fat) because we&apos;ll be healthier. Those Faddassers who have lost 20
pounds or so, admit that they feel better already and are looking
forward to feeling even better. You can have that same feeling, if you
haven&apos;t got it already, by eating healthier foods and using moderation
in all things.


 The Grapevine 
 Got a
weight report from one of our Faddassers this morning. He lost 7-1/2
pounds this week! It has to be the walking. He&apos;s not bragging though,
because &quot; I know what

pride, so I am just very pleased.&quot;

I&apos;d better get on my new walking shoes and hit the trail.

thing, but very satisfying and healthy.

1 cup boiling water
1 small package lemon Jello
12 oz. fat-free cottage cheese

Put boiling water in blender. Add Jello and blend for a few seconds to
dissolve. Add cottage cheese and blend until very smooth. Pour into
small bowls and chill.

Options: Try no-sugar cranberry Jello. Add a small can of pineapple
tidbits with juice and blend slightly to mix, but not crush the
pineapple. Or orange Jello and mandarin oranges. Use your imagination.

 Putting my best foot forward...
 Well, it&apos;s finally come down to this: I&apos;ve run out of
excuses. My latest excuse for not exercising was that I didn&apos;t have any
tennis shoes that fit. (Don&apos;t know what they&apos;re called today, but in my
mind they&apos;re still &quot;tennis shoes.&quot;) Admittedly, my feet are hard to
fit, but Saturday I found a pair of Reeboks that fit...and they were on
sale...and we had a coupon for an additional 15% off. Had no choice but
to buy them. I&apos;ve been putting Richard Simmons on hold until I had the
correct footwear, but now we&apos;re going to have to meet...face to face.
You may wonder why I need shoes to exercise. Three little words will
explain: I am clumsy. Have broken every one of my toes and broke my
ankle just walking down the steps about this time last year. Foot
protection is definitely a must for me.

We have a family of Faddassers who all lost five pounds each last week.
Their diet is the same, but they get up early and walk two miles each
day. Two miles! That&apos;s a pretty good morning walk, but it has had
amazing results. In disbelief, they even went out and purchased a new
scale. Same weight. Exercise and a healthy diet go hand-in-hand
together. You really shouldn&apos;t have one without the other if you want a
total health package.

Let&apos;s see what exercise can do for me. Hopefully, it doesn&apos;t involve
injuries.

The Watson Evangelical Church, whose members make up a large (no pun intended) portion

 Tip for Today 
 Have an uplifting telephone call... 
It&apos;s possible to exercise while you&apos;re talking on the phone. Grab some
canned food and lift while you&apos;re chatting. This will work only for
those who can do two things at one time. If you can&apos;t walk and chew gum
at the same time, this might not be the tip for you.

 ...Today is Friendship
Day
...Today is the Halfway Point of Summer
...Today is International Forgiveness Day

 Through the eyes of a child...
 Today is the halfway point of summer. The days are
getting shorter and, hopefully, cooler. The kids (and the parents) are
ready for school to start and a whole new cycle begins again. Our
youngest granddaughter is starting kindergarten and is so excited.

Can you remember the excitement of your first day of school? For some
of us, that&apos;s a LONG time ago. I don&apos;t remember the excitement, but I
remember getting new clothes and shoes and picking out the
all-important tablet. What cover picture did I want to look at every
day? It was a big decision. When I finally got to school, I remember
the smell of the newly waxed wooden floor as we laid down to take our
afternoon rest. And I remember playing cowboys near the pine trees in
the corner of the school yard. Everyone wanted to be Roy Rogers and
Dale Evans. Roy was the &quot;King of the Cowboys&quot; and rode a beautiful
palomino horse named Trigger. That&apos;s for you young folks. The older
ones will know all about Roy and Dale. Besides being movie stars, they
were wonderful Christian people and practiced that Christianity in
their work. I drove by Sheridan Elementary School in Spokane when we
were out there in 1997. The school is new, but the pine trees are still
in the corner of the yard.

If you could have half the enthusiasm for life as a child entering
kindergarten, think of what a great time you&apos;d have. Dig up some of
those old memories and try to experience the excitement again. You&apos;re
never too old to see life through the eyes of a child.


 The Grapevine 
 On Friday I mentioned Faddasser Framma&apos;s new grandson. He had a
traumatic time entering the world, but mother and child are recovering
and doing well. The father is still a little shaken, but is expected to
be okay. Framma had to wait until the next morning to see her new
grandchild because she was working. It was her first destination
Saturday morning and she said he&apos;s beautiful.  (Her youngest
granddaughter always calls her Framma.) 

 Tip for Today 
 The grapevines are fruitful... 
The stores are full of grapes: red, green and black. Use them in
salads, freeze them for snacks or &quot;ice cubes,&quot; or just enjoy them fresh
from the bunch. One of my favorite salads is made up of chopped cooke
chicken, grapes (red or green), canned pineapple chunks, pecan pieces
and Miracle Whip salad dressing. Don&apos;t overdo the dressing; just enough
to moisten the ingredients. The flavors of the fruit and chicken are
light and too much dressing can overpower the other ingredients. It&apos;s
awesome and is a lot like the chicken salad on the sandwiches at Arby&apos;s.

 ...Today is Mustard Day

 Mustard...the other condiment
 When I was a very little girl, I
ate mustard because my Dad ate
mustard. (Like the little girl in the TV commercial who folds her
peanut butter sandwich the way her Dad does.) I could hardly get it
down, but he laughed when I ate it, and even back then, I loved
getting laughs. When I put mustard on my mashed potatoes, it was a real
knee slapper, and he told all his cronies about it. 
 
Times have changed and so have my tastes. There&apos;s no
doubt that ketchup reigns. (Or is that Morton salt? I can
never remember.) It seems that everyone has their own favorites;
mustard on hot dogs, ketchup on hamburgers; and for the adventurous, a
squirt of both. I still
like mustard, but I
now prefer horse radish.

Condiments add a little
zing to an every-day meal without adding a lot of calories (when used
in what? moderation!) Try something besides ketchup and mustard. Ever
had chutney? Live dangerously...add something new to your taste palate.

 Spread your wings...

 Low-Cal Mustard Wings 
12 Chicken drummettes (drummies)
1 Tablespoon honey
Pepper and Cayenne pepper, to taste
1 Clove garlic, finely minced
2 Teaspoons Dijon mustard
Whole wheat bread crumbs, very finely ground

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray Pam on a baking sheet. Remove as
much skin as possible from the drummies. Sprinkle chicken with the
black pepper.

Combine honey, cayenne, garlic and mustard. Brush mixture onto chicken,
coating all sides lightly and evenly. Then dip them in the bread crumbs
or shake them in a Ziploc bag with the crumbs.

Place on prepared baking sheet and bake until light brown (about 30
minutes). Serve hot.

 A
condiment story to tie in
with our theme... 
Most people don&apos;t know
that
back in 1912, Hellmann&apos;s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In
fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled
for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of
call for the great ship after its stop in New York.

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever
delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to
New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever
lost.

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly
awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss.

Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of
Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known,
of course, as Sinko de Mayo. --------------------------------------

Day 60 
 ...Today is Champagne Day
...Today is Pie Day in Minnesota

 Tiny bubbles... 
 Today is
Champagne Day. Everyone needs
a little sparkle in their lives. Champagne may be just the thing.
People often think of champagnes as a ladies&apos; drink...not much zap to
it. Not so. Champagne has more alcohol than beer and more than most
still wines.

Of course, if you can&apos;t get the bottle open, it won&apos;t matter. Years
ago, the media announced that a recent study showed that drinking red
wine built up your blood and made you feel stronger. So I went down to
the liquor store and talked to Hank Roberts, the manager. He
recommended a red wine and I took it home to try it. Couldn&apos;t get it
open. I pulverized the cork with the cork screw, cut my hand trying to
pry it out with a knife, and finally called Hank. Told him no wonder it
made you stronger, it took an ox to get it out. He laughed, and said I
needed a better cork screw. So back down I went and got one with
butterfly handles that you pushed down to bring the cork up. (Kind of
like going to START to turn off your computer.)

Eventually, I got the cork out and after all that commotion, found out
that I really didn&apos;t care much for it. It always looks greener on the
other side of the fence; and often looks better in the bottle.

There are some sparking non-alcoholic wines out there that taste very
good. Most grocery stores have some in stock. If you want to class up
your meal a little, try one in a fancy glass. It always seems to taste
better. And don&apos;t forget moderation.

 Pie is not square... 
When I was looking up &quot;low-cal pie recipe&quot; on the Internet, I saw this

figured there was no way a Snickers pie could be low cal. Just goes to
show that you shouldn&apos;t go by outside appearances.

 Low-Cal Snickers Pie 
1/2 cup chocolate ice milk , softened
1 cup Lite Cool Whip, thawed
1 pkg sugar-free chocolate pudding, prepared
1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter
3 oz. grapenuts

Spray an 8&quot; or 9&quot; pie pan with Pam. In a large bowl, combine ice milk
and Cool Whip. Blend in the remaining ingredients. Freeze at least two
hours. First time cutting, cut into eight pieces and refreeze.

 Little Johnny and his family lived in the country,

father. His father passed it to one of the guests. Little Johnny came
in with the second piece of pie and gave it to his father, who gave it
to the second guest.

Day 59 
 ..Today is Watermelon Day

 Seedless is nice...
 Since today is Watermelon Day, let&apos;s talk about this
crunchy, wonderful fruit. It originated in Africa and quickly spread
around the Mediterranean and, eventually, around the world. It&apos;s no
wonder it&apos;s called &quot;water&quot; melon since it is 92% water. Served cold, it
is an icy thirst quencher on a hot summer day. The best way to eat it
is by the slice. Wear old clothes or a bib so you can put your face
right in there and enjoy the coolness of the fruit on your cheeks and
the tickle of the juice running down your chin. Today, we refrigerate
watermelon to cool it, but years ago, the melon was put in the well or
in a brook so the water would cool it and cool it.

You need a large knife and a steady hand to cut watermelon. I tried to
cut a slice for myself at the last bonfire. It was wasn&apos;t a pretty
sight. I couldn&apos;t get all the way through the melon so I turned it over
and started from the bottom. There&apos;s a poem that reads &quot;never the twain
shall meet.&quot; Well, neither did my slice cuts. Because I&apos;m so clumsy,
I&apos;m not usually allowed to have sharp objects like butcher knives so
it&apos;s probably from lack of practice, not lack of skill. The good thing
about watermelon is that it tastes just as great cut crooked as it does
cut straight. My kind of fruit!

I prefer the seedless kind because I&apos;m a lazy eater. Some people have a
lazy eye. I have a lazy appetite. I don&apos;t like to eat food that has
work involved, like picking out seeds and fish bones. And, of course,
there&apos;s the old wives&apos; tale about swallowing a watermelon seed and
looking pregnant. Well, I still look like I may have swallowed a seed,
but don&apos;t expect any surprises. I&apos;m working on getting rid of my belly.
Gonna be flat one of these days. Yes!

And to top it all off, watermelon is really good for you. It&apos;s a
healthy fruit. The USDA states: 
 
 &quot;Watermelon
is fat free and is a source of vitamins A, B6, C, and thiamine. Studies
have shown that a cup and a half of watermelon contains about 9 to 13
milligrams of lycopene. On average, watermelon has about 40 percent
more lycopene than raw tomatoes. Red, ripe flesh is the best indicator
of the sweetest and most nutritious watermelon, though it&apos;s hard to
choose the ripest melon when it&apos;s uncut&quot;.
 

 Let&apos;s
celebrate!

 It DOES melt in your
trunk...
 Yesterday I told you about my jump-start experience.
There&apos;s more. While rummaging through the trunk, searching for the
jumper cables, I ran across a bag of groceries. It was stuff left over
from the last bonfire and included fun-size Hershey bars, marshmallows
and graham crackers for S&apos;Mores. When I saw the Hershey bars, I went
for them like a crow with fresh roadkill. Forgot about the trunk being
hot, though, and the bars were liquid. I almost squirted one right
through my fingers when I picked it up. To be honest, I really thought
about opening one and licking the chocolate off the wrapper, but
there&apos;s just a shred of dignity left in me, so I left them there. If I
bring them in and put them in the refrigerator, it will be too easy and
too tempting.

Chocolate does that to people. What is your favorite food? Can you eat
just a little or is the temptation too great? There are challenges out
there daily, but we&apos;re doing quite well at making wise choices...or, in
my case, they&apos;re being made for me. (If it hadn&apos;t been melted, I&apos;d have
had one.) Continue to eat in moderation and make wise choices and we&apos;re
going to be GORGEOUS when we reach our goals.

 An overweight businessman decided it was time to shed some
excess pounds. He took his new diet seriously, even changing his
driving route to avoid his favorite bakery.

One morning, however, he arrived at work carrying a gigantic chocolate
cake. His fellow employees scolded him, but his smile remained cherubic.

&quot;This is a very special chocolate cake, &quot; he explained. &quot;I accidentally
drove by the bakery this morning and there in the window was a host of
goodies. I felt this was no accident, so I prayed, &apos;Lord, if you want
me to have one of those delicious chocolate cakes, let me have a
parking space directly in front of the bakery.&apos; And, sure enough,&quot; he
continued, &quot;the eighth time around the block, there it was!&quot;

 ...Today
is Girlfriends&apos; Day

 Jump starts...
 This has nothing to do with Girlfriends&apos; Day. It&apos;s
about another day with detours. As I was leaving work, I got a call
from Lyle. He was leaving his truck in Sacred Heart and needed a ride.
It&apos;s only a matter of 20 some miles so it wasn&apos;t a big deal. When we
got to Trailways, where he&apos;d left his car this morning, it wouldn&apos;t
start. The headlights came on, but the starter wouldn&apos;t work. Luckily,
jeanie-on-the-spot that I am, I had jumper cables in my trunk. Guess
what? With all the parking spaces available, someone had pulled in
right on either side of him so I had no alternative but to hit the
ditch.
The grass in front of his car looked awfully muddy, but I gave it my
best shot and did an Eskimo stop right by his car. (Nose to nose.) The
car started right up when the cables were hooked up and I managed to
get back up on the pavement without getting stuck.

At some time or another in our lives, we all need a jump start; we need
a little more spark in our lives to get us going. There  are occasions when the lights are
on and nobody&apos;s home, but not with
Faddassers. We&apos;re the Lake Woebegone types: above-average intelligence
and &quot; real good lookin&apos;.&quot; Our lights are on and we&apos;re

 Today is &quot;weigh day&quot; for some of us, and I got this note from a

 Down

can, too. I know it would not have happened without a queen leading us,
and also prayer. Don&apos;t give up.

 A gratifying
e-mail for me because I have been struggling in my daily bouts with
moderation. I made a decision right after I weighed early this morning
and had gained half a pound, that this week I was going to get going
and do things right. The e-mail was a positive reinforcement. Thanks,

 Surprise package...
 My
granddaughter, Mackenzie, came to see me when I got home from work. We
had several games of Care Bear dominoes and watched some cartoons
together until Grandpa got home. That delayed the Fadd Gram a bit, but
she&apos;s worth it.

The Fadd Gram is a real surprise package. It&apos;s kind of like some first
babies...you never know when they&apos;ll arrive. That&apos;s the interesting
part of life. You never know what surprise is going to be around the
next corner. Some of them can be a real challenge; some of them a real
joy. As you experience the surprises along our Faddasser journey,
remember that you can do it. You can use moderation when you
eat. You can choose the healthier foods. We&apos;re in this together

have to be crazy! You wouldn&apos;t need collagen
   injections. In this heat, the burning would puff

big-time.) 
...Last day of Coffee Week

 Stop and smell the fresh bread...
 There is nothing that tickles the taste glands like
the smell of fresh bread. It&apos;s an aroma that seems to penetrate the
whole house and as you enter the front door, it says, &quot;Welcome. Come in
and make yourself at home.&quot; We would eat a lot healthier if fruits and
vegetables smelled like fresh bread. Did you know that smell
contributes 80% to the taste of food?

Aromas can bring up memories from the little niches in your mind where
they&apos;ve been tucked away and forgotten. I have some orange hand
soap
called Lifebuoy that I special order because it reminds me of my
Grandma&apos;s bathroom. I used to lather up with that in her old claw foot
bathtub. It hasn&apos;t been around for years and only our older Faddassers
will remember it. I think it&apos;s carbolic acid that gives it the
uniqueness. Not a &quot;fragrance,&quot; just a good, clean smell.

Think about aromas that send you into the past. When I smell diesel
smoke, I think of Spokane. When I was very young and very short, my
nose was at the level of the bus exhaust and when the bus pulled up to
let us on, I got a good whiff.

If you&apos;re tempted by the aroma, stop and inhale, and then think about
it. Are you hungry or are you just loving the smell? Chances are, it&apos;s
just the smell... so enjoy yourself. Deep breaths don&apos;t contain
calories and oxygen is good for you.


 The Grapevine 
The sermon seemed to go pretty well. I went over 15 minutes on Father&apos;s

 Tip for Today 
 Cold cuts and salad 
When it&apos;s hot and you don&apos;t want to cook, it&apos;s tempting to put out some
sandwich meat and cheese and toss a salad together. A lot of cold cuts
are smoked and could be loaded in carcinogens, so be careful. Choose
turkey breast, boiled ham, and beef. Better yet, make extra when you
have a roast and freeze slices. And hold the mayo. Sandwich spreads can
make you spread.

 Last coffee joke. 
Making coffee has become the great compromise of the decade. It’s the
only thing“real”men do that doesn’t seem to threaten their

the spring back into the toilet-tissue holder or taking a chicken out
of the freezer to thaw. --- Erma Bombeck

 Need more memory...
 My computer is running a little slower than usual and
after doing some checking, I realized that I have only 128 whatever of
memory. (Is it megs...like in nutmegs?) Lyle says his computer runs
really fast. I checked his. He has 512 of those things. I ordered more
memory and it should be here Monday.

Wouldn&apos;t it be great if we could order memory for ourselves? This is
the 54th day of doing Fadd Grams and I can&apos;t remember if I wrote about
something or if I just THOUGHT I&apos;d written about it. If I start to
sound like an echo, please let me know. I probably won&apos;t remember that
you told me, but it might make you feel better.

A lot of people have &quot;selective memory.&quot; They forget things they don&apos;t
like to do. (Oops! I FORGOT to take out the garbage.) If we&apos;re going to
be successful Faddassers, we need to be selective in our memory and our
eating. 
 
 Remember to eat in moderation. Don&apos;t forget to drink lots of water. Remind yourself to have fresh fruit and
vegetables on hand.

I&apos;m running a little late today because I&apos;ve been working on my sermon
for tomorrow. In case you don&apos;t know, we go to the Evangelical Church
in Watson. Our pastor, Bob Buchanan, does the preaching and his wife
Gail the piano playing. They are at a family reunion this weekend so
Bob asked me to do the sermon. Then Gail remembered that she&apos;d be gone,
too, and said, &quot;Oh, and will you play the piano, too?&quot; Later she told
me it wouldn&apos;t be so bad because the piano stool has a swivel seat and
I could just twirl around and start the sermon. We&apos;ll see. With my
history, I&apos;ll probably go to twirl and fall right off the stool.

 Eating corn makes you smile from ear to ear... 
For those of you who have trouble boiling water, here are two alternate
ways to prepare corn on the cob. (1) Roast them on your grill. Soak the
ears (not yours) in water for 30 minutes or so with the husks on. Grill
with the husks on. (2) Mike them. For moist corn, wrap ears (again, not
yours) in wet paper towels before you microwave them. Remember: You
have to climb 500 steps to work off the fat gained in a pat of

 It&apos;s Fri-i-i-i-i-day!
 This has been one long, hot week. I&apos;m fortunate to
work in an air-conditioned office. Can&apos;t even comprehend how people who
work outside can do it. My husband works on road construction and now
has an air-conditioned truck. Some of the guys, however, work right by
the hot mix, which is over 350 degrees. In a situation like that,
there&apos;s no way to get away from the heat. The weekend and home offer
the only relief.

Are you ready for the weekend? There&apos;s
nothing nicer than the clink of ice in a big glass of cold water. Do
you have ice and fresh fruit and vegetables on hand? If you&apos;re
not
prepared, you&apos;ll find yourself eating food that&apos;s not good for you and
your best intentions will go right out the window.

 Tip for Today 
 Pick a pickle 
I tried one of our family&apos;s favorite snacks the other day. It had
slipped to the back of my mind, along with most of my memory. There are
several variations, but you need baby dill pickles, low-calorie cream
cheese and sliced dried beef. I&apos;ve also had them in a tortilla. Take a
piece of dried beef large enough to wrap around the pickle. Spread a
light layer of cream cheese on the dried beef, lay the pickle in the
middle and roll it up. You can eat it whole or slice it in half. If you
use the tortilla, put the cream cheese on the tortilla and then the
dried beef and pickle(s). It&apos;s a very tasty treat.

 Another coffee joke. Will Coffee Week ever end? 
A man and his wife were having an argument about who should brew the
coffee each morning.

The wife said, &quot;You should do it, because you get up first, and then we
don&apos;t have to wait as long to get our coffee.&quot;

The husband said, &quot;You are in charge of cooking around here and you
should do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait for my
coffee.&quot;

Wife replies, &quot;No, you should do it, and besides, it&apos;s in the Bible
that the man should do the coffee.&quot;

Husband replies, &quot;I don&apos;t believe that...show me.&quot;

So she fetched the Bible, opened the New Testament and showed him at
the top of several pages, that it indeed says:

 ...Today
is St. Pantaleone&apos;s Day
 Pantaleone was an
Italian physician who died in 305. He became a Christian martyr and was
eventually made a saint by the Catholic church. For more information,
go to this web site. It&apos;s really quite a story. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11447a.htm 
 ...Coffee
Week continues (and so
do the coffee jokes) 
 
 You don&apos;t have to be a martyr to reach your
goal...
 A martyr is described as &quot;a person who makes great
sacrifices or suffers much in order to further a belief, cause or
principle.&quot; ( American Heritage Dictionary ) There are diets out
there that do require you to become a martyr in order to reach your
goal. Remember that we are not on a diet. We are practicing MODERATION.
You don&apos;t have to be a martyr and give up all of the food that you
like...just a little bit of it.

I remember when my little grandson, Justin, was trying to justify the
chocolate that was all around his mouth. His two sisters were caught
standing on a stool in the pantry, guilt written all over their
startled, little faces. They didn&apos;t have a leg to stand on, so to
speak. Justin denied eating any chocolate at first, and then relented
and said,
&quot;But I only had a teeny, tiny little bit. Taylor and Aly ate a whole
bunch.&quot; He seemed to think that the quantity was directly related to
the amount of guilt he should feel.

It&apos;s not so much to give up... probably more than a teeny, tiny bit...
but, after all, half a loaf is better than none. It&apos;s better to have
not quite so much as to have none at all.

And remember to slow down and enjoy the taste. I keep going back to the
word &quot;savor,&quot; which means to taste or enjoy with zest;
relish .
(Actually, skip the relish. It will just add calories.) How many times
have you gulped something down without really tasting the flavor? Slow
down and eat healthy foods...all in moderation. That&apos;s our journey in a
nutshell. (Not insinuating that any of you are nuts, but if the shell
fits, don&apos;t crack it.)

 Tip for Today 
 I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s corn, without butter 
The local sweet corn is ripe and the little corn stands are popping up
all over. You need the butter taste to really appreciate corn on the
cob, but you don&apos;t need to slather it on so it&apos;s running down your
arms. Here is a place to really use moderation. Actually, the I Can&apos;t
Believe It&apos;s Not Butter spray is pretty good on corn. If you have to
use real butter, use it sparingly. Give up something else to compensate
for all the extra fat. Your arteries will appreciate it.

 A sweet little boy surprised his grandmother one morning
and brought her a cup of coffee. He made it himself and was so proud.
He anxiously waited to hear the verdict on the quality of the coffee.
The grandmother had never in her life had such a bad cup of coffee. As
she forced down the last sip, she noticed three of those little green
army guys in the bottom of the cup.

She asked, &quot;Honey, why would three little green army guys be in the

 There&apos;s a joke about Norwegians and how stolid they

down and Lena running away with Sven.&quot; Without any expression, Ole
replies, &quot;It could be worse.&quot; Sometimes you wonder how it COULD be
worse.

Lately, I&apos;ve been looking at one of my friends who wants to lose
weight. She&apos;s about four sizes smaller than I am and I think, &quot;I&apos;d love
to be your size.&quot; She&apos;s looking at someone two sizes smaller than she
is, and thinking, &quot;That&apos;s how I want to be.&quot; I&apos;m sure there&apos;s
someone
out there who&apos;s larger than I am who is wishing they could be down to
my size. So when I think about my weight, I think &quot;It could be worse.&quot;

 Be happy with who you are, while doing your best to improve, and
you&apos;ll eventually get to that spot where you want to be . We
evidently all have good appetites so let&apos;s put that &quot;moderation theory&quot;
to the test and cut our portions in half for just one day. It soon
becomes the norm. I can no longer eat the same amount of cereal in the
morning that I did 51 days ago. I&apos;m comfortably full at half the volume.

Try moderation. It works. If you think you&apos;re still hungry, fill in
with water and fresh fruit and vegetables.

 Tip for Today 
 Get in the groove with chicken 
Today is &quot;Groovy Chicken&quot; day and whether it&apos;s groovy or not, chicken
is good for you. There&apos;s so many different ways to prepare it. It&apos;s
healthiest to take the skin off before you cook it. (Be careful that
you don&apos;t &quot;skin&quot; yourself while skinning the chicken.) Food is much
more appetizing if you don&apos;t serve it with bleeding knuckles. That&apos;s
experience talking. Here&apos;s a recipe from the Cooking ala Heart cookbook published by Appletree Press in Mankato, MN.

 SHAKE AND MAKE 
 Use as a crispy coating for chicken, fish, meats and vegetables 

2/3 cup non-fat dry milk powder
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons low-sodium chicken-flavored bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
Mix all ingredients thoroughly. Makes
about 2/3 cup...enough for one chicken or several fish fillets. Moisten
meat slightly and shake in the mixture.

If using chicken, remove the skin first. Place in non-stick sprayed
baking pan and bake at 375 degrees until chicken is tender. (About 45
minutes to an hour.)

 Life is a carousel sometimes...
 As you can see, I&apos;m
running a little late. There are
days like that, when things happen that are beyond your control. That&apos;s
when you celebrate Carousel Day. Started out going in circles this
morning and haven&apos;t stopped. When your life gets out of control, just
&quot;Let go and let God.&quot; That&apos;s what the Reverend Robert Schuller advises.
It&apos;s hard for those of us who like to be in control to let go, but
there comes a point when that&apos;s the best alternative. So if you&apos;re
having problems, whether eating or otherwise, turn them over to God.
Sometimes I go in a room by myself and say it out loud. &quot;I&apos;m letting
go, God. Please take over from here.&quot; Try it. It works.

Well, the highligh t low point of my day was
having
my nasal passage cauterized with an electric branding iron. It wasn&apos;t
exactly a branding iron, but it does the same thing. I&apos;m sure if you
looked up my nostril there would be a little horseshoe imprint or some
kind of brand so you&apos;d know what clinic I belonged to. I had actual
ashes coming out of my nose when I tried to whinny. (Is this more
information than you wanted to know? Okay. Enough said.)

That was at noon so it took away my craving for lunch. Also, things HAD
to get better from that point on. Actually, out of boredom while
waiting for the doctor to arrive, I read all the labels on the

 My heart burns for you... 
People who are overweight are more
prone to heartburn and acid reflux.
One tip: Avoid eating large meals. The more you stuff into your
stomach, the more likely there&apos;ll be an overflow into your esophagus.
Try eating four or five small meals instead of two or three large ones.
And drink a small glass of water after the meal. It helps dilute the
acid.

 Pour me another cup of coffee...
 Good news for those
of you who always have a coffee
mug in your hand. One of the latest studies shows that coffee, in
moderation , may be quite healthy
for you. Besides clearing the cob
webs and perking up your mind, it has some healthy antioxidants that
may prove to be useful in promoting heart health and decreasing the
risk of type 2 diabetes. Moderation
would be two cups a day. 

Keep in mind that caffeine is one of
the main parts of coffee and no
matter how you look at it, it is still a drug and can become very
addictive. When you have an addiction, you can run into withdrawal side
effects that include headache and jitters. Also, coffee can raise your
cholesterol levels considerably.

Two cups...two things. One:
Forget about the cream and the other
things you can add to your coffee. They&apos;re just going to add calories.
Two: Coffee is no substitute for fruits and vegetables when it comes to
antioxidants.

The &quot;good coffee&quot; research is
relatively recent and the jury is still
out on whether it is really that healthy for you.

 I&apos;ll have my coffee black 
If you have coffee, order it black.
Black coffee has basically no
calories. The calories really mount up fast when you add cream and
sugar products. Example: Starbuck&apos;s caffe latte (grande 16 oz.) has 260
calories, 120 of them from fat; 14 grams of fat, and 200 mg of salt.

 At my Mother&apos;s table...
 Today is Parent&apos;s Day. We have Mother&apos;s Day in May,
Father&apos;s Day in June and now, in July, Parents&apos; Day. That should pretty
much cover the bases. Not that I&apos;m against celebrating parenthood, but
it seems like it&apos;s a bit overdone.

Many people blame most of their faults on their parents and their
upbringing. Personally, I think you&apos;re your own keeper, but often your
childhood does affect the way you live. Food, in our family, was kind
of a reward. When my Dad went on a drunken binge, we went on a food
binge. We packed ourselves into the car and went to the supermarket in
Marshall. We got lots of snacks and the makings for California burgers.
This was back in the days when restaurants in small towns were closed
by 6:30 PM. That was my Mom&apos;s way of coping, and ours, too. I&apos;m not
complaining. I&apos;m just saying that the ways you learn in childhood often
stay with you and I find myself using food for consolation even
today...even when I know why I&apos;m doing it.

You know about my fudgesickle habit. Well, the Schwan&apos;s man was here
Friday and I thought I&apos;d give it one more shot. Didn&apos;t work. I cannot
seem to control my fudgesickle intake any more than my father could
control his alcohol intake. So... I guess I&apos;d better quit buying them.
That&apos;s my last resort. If I buy them, I&apos;m haunted until they&apos;re
gone.

Do you have something in your life that you can&apos;t control? If you do,
and moderation doesn&apos;t work, then you need to get it out of the way.
We&apos;re in this together and we can do it. We ARE doing it.

 Go stir crazy...
 When the weather is hot, don&apos;t forget about doing a stir fry. You
can get by with much less meat and lots more vegetables. They&apos;re very
tasty, very healthy and can be made quickly. Keep some frozen stir-fry
veggies in the freezer, or better yet, visit your local farmers&apos; market
and get them just-picked. Beware of the soy sauce though. It has
a lot
of sodium and if you&apos;re watching your blood pressure, you need to use
moderation on your salt intake.

 It doesn&apos;t hurt to take a hard look at yourself from time

&quot;Well,&quot; said the director, &quot;we fill a bathtub, then we offer a
teaspoon, a teacup and a bucket to the patient, and ask him or her to
empty the bathtub.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; said the visitor. &quot;A normal person would use the
bucket because it&apos;s bigger than the teaspoon or teacup.&quot;

 Losing it while
you sleep...
 &quot;Why do I
weigh less in the morning?&quot; is a question that I&apos;ve been asked by the
the &quot;daily weighers.&quot; Found this question and answer on the Internet.
Should help answer the question.

 Q: The law of conservation of mass states that the combined mass of
the reactants is equal to the combined mass of the products. Why then,
do we weigh less in the morning than in the evening, and how does this
support the law of conservation of mass?

A: You are correct in your statement that matter must be conserved in
any closed system. When you weigh yourself in the evening and
then
again the next morning, however, you have not maintained a closed
system all night . Weight losses include any urine or other
body
wastes, plus the things that are less obvious. The normal daily
urine
loss at normal temperature is approximately 1400 ml/day or
approximately 3.3 pounds. When your body converts food materials
to
energy, CO2 and water vapor are released to the blood stream that
ultimately may leave through the lungs. Water lost through the
lungs
amounts to approximately 350 ml/day at normal temperatures or
approximately 3/4 pound. The skin loses another 350 ml/day to
insensible perspiration (that which you do not notice as liquid water,
but evaporates directly into the air). The sweat you do notice as
liquid is lost at a rate in proportion to the surrounding temperature
and the level of activity. Normal temperature with little
activity can
produce approximately 100 ml/day this way while under prolonged heavy
exercise this number may go up to 5000 ml/day or 11 pounds.

The daily totals for water loss during a normal day add up to between
2400 and 6700 ml/day or from between about 6 to about 15 pounds per
day. If 1/3 of this occurs at night, the body weight loss could
be in
the range of 2 to 3 pounds.

Just a couple of squirts on salad is all it takes. A serving is 10

Here&apos;s the final word on nutrition and health. It&apos;s a relief to know
the truth after all those conflicting medical studies.

The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than
the British or Americans.

The French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart attacks
than the British or Americans.

The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks
than the British or Americans.

The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks
than the British or Americans.

 Chew-chew training...
 I am probably one of the fastest eaters you&apos;ll ever
munch with. Sometimes I hardly chew my food. It&apos;s a quick
crunch-crunch-gulp type of eating. With today&apos;s hectic lifestyles, we
all seem to be in a hurry. One thing I need to practice is chewing my
food longer. And slowing down. I have a couple of friends who are a
little on the slow-side when it comes to eating. When we&apos;re out
together, I&apos;m washing down the final scraps of my meal and
contemplating dessert and they&apos;re still arranging their napkins. I
spend a lot of time sitting watching other people eat. There&apos;s an up
side though: they&apos;re kind of a captive audience and, although I&apos;m
usually short of words, I manage to keep the conversation from lagging.

So if you&apos;re a fast eater, slow down and smell the pork chops, so to
speak. As long as the calories are tallying up, you might as well get

 Back in the late 80s

indication of how the film dragged and the fact that you wanted to
hurry it along and get it over with.

You can&apos;t hurry losing weight either. Some of our Faddassers have
experienced a relatively steady weight loss. For others, it has been a
struggle. On our journey, we want to hurry things along. It&apos;s like
following a Sunday driver on a busy Monday morning. You want to go

and fellowship. We sit around the bonfire and chat and eat...two of our
favorite pastimes. You&apos;re all welcome if you&apos;d like to join us. Just
let me know. It&apos;s in a different place every week. (No, we&apos;re not
trying to outrun the fire marshal, we&apos;re just taking turns hosting it.) 

 Tip for Today 
 Are you exercising yet? 
It&apos;s been hard getting started on an exercise program. In Minnesota we
find that engines are hard starting in the winter. My motor is the
opposite. It&apos;s a &apos;40 model and it doesn&apos;t like to start in the heat.
Exercise is not like doing a cannonball off the high board. You can
ease into it. Try 10 minutes a day. It should build your enthusiasm a
little and once you&apos;re out there, you might decide to make it 15.

 Little
things become big things... 
Just came from the drug store where I had to pick up a prescription. As
I was leaving, I walked by the candy aisle and remembered how many
times I had grabbed something from there and paid for it with my
prescription. Then, before I got the car started to head for
home, I
had torn the package open and was greedily taking the first bite. By
the time I left the parking lot, I was wiping chocolate from my face
and saying, &quot;Aaah...that was good.&quot;

Today I just passed by the aisle. It wasn&apos;t that I wouldn&apos;t have
enjoyed a candy bar, but I did some thinking first. It&apos;s a no-brainer.
I&apos;m losing weight; I&apos;m on my way home for lunch, which is only a
two-minute drive; and I&apos;m in control. So here I am eating some fresh
melon while my Lean Cuisine is heating up in the microwave.

If you add up the little things, like a candy bar, half of a hamburger
bun, extra dressing on your salad, and quick handfuls of snacks as you
pass by, they do become a big thing. And then multiply by 365 and that
could amount to a pretty good weight gain. So keep on practicing your
self-control and do the best you can. God will do the rest.

 Tip for Today 
 Dental
Awareness Day 
Here I am on my soda soap box again, but I really want you to know what
you&apos;re getting when you drink pop. Have you ever seen what cola can do
to the paint on a car? It strips it and discolors the paint. It&apos;s
powerful stuff and it&apos;s not necessarily the sugar, like everyone
believes. The active ingredient in cola is phosphoric acid. Its pH is
2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about four days. If it&apos;s that
corrosive, think what it does to the enamel of your teeth. One thing
though: Do not brush your teeth right after drinking cola . The
cola softens the enamel and you can damage it by brushing. Wait an hour
and then brush. If you don&apos;t believe me, google &quot;uses for coke.&quot; You&apos;ll
be absolutely amazed.

 This minister just had all of his remaining teeth

But, on the third Sunday, he preached 1 hour 25 minutes.

When asked about this by some of the congregation, he responded this
way.

&quot;The first Sunday, my gums were so sore it hurt to talk. The second

...This is Hug Week

 Hugs help...
 Sometimes a hug means more than any words you can say.
A hug can brighten your day. A hug can bring your attitude up several
notches. There
are even studies
that show hugs can make you healthier and lift depression. And
a hug is free. There is no cost, no calories, and very little effort.
Just put out your arms and embrace someone. And look at us! Pretty soon
our loved ones will be able to reach farther around us and we&apos;ll get
even better hugs.

Hugs themselves are great, but who came up with the name hug ?
Ever stopped to think about it? The word sounds like a something a
foghorn would blast out in the fog. H-H-H-H-UGGG! It sounds like ugh
and bug and slug and chug and thug. None of those words create warm
images in our minds. I think we should change the name to rainbows.
Rainbows arch like arms and they are such delights when they surprise
us after a rain shower. And there&apos;s always the thought of the pot of
gold at the end. Wrap a rainbow around someone and let the &quot;golden&quot;
sunshine shine forth from your heart. It will be a treasure that money
cannot buy...not even a pot of gold.


 The Grapevine 
 At least one of our Faddassers is
&quot;baching&quot; it this week. How DO you
spell that? It&apos;s like the b-a-c-h in bachelor. The dictionary shows
both spellings: baching and batching...and they both mean the same
thing. And they both look weird. Anyway, he&apos;s on his own this week. He
needs to be very careful. It is so very easy to graze continually when
you&apos;re alone. I can give a true testimony to that. Remember moderation.. 

 Tip for Today 
 Something&apos;s a little too fishy... 
Haven&apos;t said much about eating fish because I&apos;m not a fish eater. I
love lobster and shrimp, but I&apos;m kind of a lazy eater and like to have
something I can gulp down quickly. Not something I have to pick bones
out of. But fish is good for us and we should try to have a couple of
servings a week. This is a rather tasty sandwich. Like the pie hint
yesterday, using one slice of bread saves a lot of calories and is much
healthier.

 Hawaiian Tuna Toast 
1 6-1/2 oz. can of water-packed tuna, drained
1 8 oz. can unsweetened crushed pineapple, drained
1/4 cup calorie-reduced mayonnaise
4 slices of whole wheat or rye bread

Combine tuna, pineapple and mayonnaise. Mix well.
Spread mixture over bread and place on a baking sheet. Bake at 450
degrees until hot. Serve immediately.

 ..Today is Ice Cream Cone Day
...Today is Talk to a Telemarketer Day

 We all scream for ice cream
 The weather is perfect for celebrating Ice Cream Cone
Day. Better be a fast licker though or it will melt and run down your
arms to your elbows and then drip off on your jeans. Doesn&apos;t happen to
me because I not only lick my cone, I often chomp. Love the coolness of
ice cream (and fudgesicles) going down my allergy-beaten gullet.
Because of its cooling effect on my hot throat tissues, I consider it
medicinal. (Don&apos;t laugh; we each have our own way of justifying things.)

Have an ice cream cone, but a small size instead of large one; a single
scoop instead of a double decker and, when you can&apos;t decide on a
flavor, try vanilla, plain, or white. Adding chocolate or other
flavorings often increases the calorie count.

As far as Talk to a Telemarketer Day goes, it was a startling
coincidence when that popped up on the calendar. You see, last night,
after a hot and weary day, I answered the phone and a man&apos;s voice that
was much too perky for the weather, bounced into my ear. &quot;Hey, Jean!
How is your day going so far?&quot; At that point, I knew it wasn&apos;t anyone
local. No one in the Montevideo area could sound that peppy after the
weather we&apos;d had. So I answered, &quot;It was going pretty well until you
called.&quot; He laughed and went into his spiel on satellite dishes...and I
hung up on him. A little voice inside said, &quot;He&apos;s a people, too. You
could have been a little more polite.&quot; With that little guilt trip
nagging me, you can imagine my thoughts when I saw what day it was
today. To sooth my guilty feelings, I had an ice cream cone. I&apos;m an
equal-opportunity celebrator.

We do, however, need to remember moderation in our comments, as well as
our appetite. God loves everyone...even telemarketers.

 Tip for Today 
 Piecing together dessert 
If you could just die for pie, make a smart choice. Choose a
single-crust pie, preferably with a fruit filling. A big share of the
fat is in the pastry crust so you&apos;ll have less fat grams &quot;any way you
cut it.&quot;

...Today is Shark Awareness Day

 Can&apos;t see the forest for the trees...
 Ever had something
really obvious right in front of
you and didn&apos;t see it? When it finally dawns on you that it&apos;s there,
you do an inward, &quot;Duh!&quot; That happened to me this week. I&apos;ve had
grocery store managers in several stores combing the shelves looking
for my favorite cereal: Corn Total. This has been going on for several
months and I&apos;ve been kind of irked at the stores for no longer carrying
it. I settled for Whole Grain Total.The other day I decided to try
something a little different and was drawn to a box of Oatmeal Crisp
with Almonds. There&apos;s a big red heart on the box and it reads, &quot;May
help REDUCE THE RISK of heart disease.&quot; I like oatmeal and I like
almonds so I decided to give it a try.

As I was preparing to take the first
bite the other morning, I read the
box. Right on the front, in a big blue banner, was this statement: ALL
General Mills Cereals are made with Whole Grain!&quot; So that&apos;s where my Corn Total went! One bite and I dumped the bowl. It&apos;s very,
very sweet. I looked at the nutrition facts and found that there were
220 calories per serving and that eat serving had 16 grams of
sugar...or over three teaspoonsful.

You may think we have no cause to
celebrate Shark Awareness Day, but I
think I just proved that we do. Read the labels. As Snagglepuss would
say, &quot;Read the front even !&quot; Now that I&apos;m examining the box, I
see that on the side...yellow print on a yellow background...it reads,
&quot;Sweet, crispy flakes with whole grain oats, crunchy almonds, and
delicious oat clusters.&quot; I&apos;ll repeat: Read the labels. You could
be
surprised.

 The Grapevine 
 We went to the Friday night bonfire
with a little trepidation; after
all, it was 100 degrees and most people, with any sense at all, would
have been inside where it was cool. It turned out to be awesome. The
fire pit was in a big shaded area and, as early as 7 PM, it was really
quite comfortable. A little breeze blew the smoke into the woods and by
9 PM we were almost ready for sweaters. Only in Minnesota can the temps
bounce around like that. Good thing we&apos;re so tough. 

 Tip for Today 
 Water, water, water... 
Just can&apos;t keep saying it enough: you
must drink lots of water in this
kind of weather. And no pop, soda...whatever you call it. A friend told
me the other day that her doctor had said soda is a big cause of
gaining weight. She asked, &quot;What about diet soda?&quot; He replied, &quot;That&apos;s
even worse...five times worse. It will just make you hungrier.&quot;
Remember moderation and, if you can&apos;t stop cold-turkey, at least try to
cut down on the pop. Soda is so &quot;duh.&quot;
 
Smile for Today 
 &quot;Yeah, sure, you betcha...we
WISH&quot; calorie counting. 
Pies and cakes should be cut neatly, in even wedges or slices. If not,
the responsibility falls on the person putting them away to &quot;straighten
up the edges&quot; by slicing away the offending irregularities, which then
have no calories when eaten. If pie or cake is neatly cut, but the
remainder is not easily divisible into equal servings, it&apos;s also
permissible to even things up, also without calorie consequence.

 ...Today is French Fries Day
...Bastille Day
...Pandemonium Day

 The French Connection...
 Today is French Fries Day. For some of you, that may
be cause for celebration, but for me, it was the start of one of my
downward spirals into the fatty kingdom of O-B City. One of the times,
years ago, when I was in Weight Watchers, I had reached my goal and was
struttin&apos; my stuff, happy to have a somewhat girlish figure again. That
night at the meeting, one girl asked the leader, &quot;Will I ever be able
to eat French Fries again?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the leader, with pride in her voice, &quot;once you&apos;ve
reached your goal and gone through maintenance, you can have six French
Fries.&quot;

Now I don&apos;t even especially care for French Fries, but the idea
that I would have to &quot;count&quot; my food for the rest of my life, if I
wanted to stay as I was, just blew my mind.

I never went back, and without the support, I steadily gained back
everything that I had worked so hard to lose...plus about 50 more
pounds through the years.

The only way that I can see myself successfully losing weight is the
way we&apos;re doing it in the Faddassers: with moderation and forethought.
It is working for me, and though I&apos;ve had some fudgesicle glitches, I&apos;m
steadily losing weight and I&apos;m feeling better. We&apos;re developing a
healthy lifestyle that will soon be habit for us. It&apos;s the weekend
again...the worst time for many of us to &quot;moderate.&quot; Remember to eat
meals at your regular time and just say NO if it&apos;s something you don&apos;t
need.

 The Grapevine 
Got another success-gram yesterday. One of our Faddassers had finally
gotten off the plateau she&apos;d be on. That is a GREAT feeling.

And one of our teen members, who looked pretty good when she started,
is steadily losing weight and is going to be thisclose  to gorgeous by the time school starts again.

Also added another name to our mailing list so the list is getting
bigger while we get smaller. Can&apos;t beat that!

 Berry, berry good... 
There are so many ripe berries in the markets today, why not try mixing

 This isn&apos;t really a food joke, but it&apos;s too good not to

 One Sunday morning,
everyone in one bright, beautiful, tiny Norwegian community got up
early and went to the local church. Before the services started,
the
townspeople were sitting in their pews and talking about their lives,
their families, etc. Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the
church. Everyone started screaming and running for the entrance,
trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil
incarnate. Soon everyone was evacuated from the church, except
for
Ole, who sat calmly in his pew, not moving, seemingly oblivious to the
fact that God&apos;s ultimate enemy was in his presence.

Now this confused Satan a bit, so he walked up to Ole and said, &quot;Do you
not know who I am?&quot; 

Ole replied, &quot;Yeah, you betcha I do.&quot;

Satan asked, &quot;Are you not afraid of me?&quot;
 
&quot;Nope,&quot; said Ole, &quot;I am not.&quot;

Satan was a little perturbed at this, and queried, &quot;Why are you not
afraid of me?&quot;
 
Ole calmly replied, &quot;Been married to your sister for over 48 years.&quot;

 Stormy weather...
 The storms that hit here about 4:30 this afternoon are
moving out of our area. There is a continuous rumbling in the east, the
winds have died down, and a kind of spooky calm has taken over. The sky
has been almost greener than our parched grass and there are reports of
hail and damaging winds.

I&apos;ve been down in the lower level watching the weather channel, waiting
for the weather to pass through so I could get online and send out our
Fadd Gram.

Just before I left the office about 4:30 today, there were a couple of
guys talking about our need for rain and would this be another false
alarm. One of them said, &quot;I&apos;d like to see about three inches of
rain.&quot; Well,  KDMA just reported 3&quot; of
rain in this short time, and there are flash flood warnings. Hopefully, there isn&apos;t much crop damage, but you have to be careful
what you wish for.

Run across any storms in your healthy living lately? Or has it been
pretty much a &quot;dry run.&quot; There will always be storms in our path, but
isn&apos;t it great that God ties up the storm package with a beautiful
rainbow? Our rainbow will be the feeling we get when we can see our
feet; when we can bend over and pick something up without a pounding in
the head; and when we no longer puff when we walk a few feet.

Speaking of puffing, when I was in Italy, we were hurrying back to our
bus and I was trying to keep up with our fast-walking guide. Between
gasps, I mentioned to him that if I was going to do any heavy
breathing, I&apos;d like it to be from something besides walking. I don&apos;t
know if he thought I was &quot;soliciting&quot; or what, but he increased
his
pace and I didn&apos;t see him again until we got to the bus. He
evidently
didn&apos;t understand American female humor.

Each of you: Keep up the pace. We&apos;re doing well and we&apos;ll do even
better as we get healthier.


 The Grapevine 
Have had another success report and I&apos;m so glad that our Faddassers are

Since it&apos;s International Puzzle Day and I&apos;m home alone and a box of new

 It&apos;s tea time 
Advertising agencies are hyping today what many people have known for
ages: green tea seems to have a healing effect on our bodies. If you&apos;ve
been out in the sun too long and come home lobster-red, trying drinking
three cups of green tea daily. The tea provides extra antioxidants that

 How hot WAS it today?
 Our outside thermometer read 90 degrees at 4:30 this
afternoon. The people I talked with today said that it was &quot;better
today than it was yesterday.&quot;  It
was so hot yesterday that people were sitting in each other&apos;s shadows. 
 
I can&apos;t judge since I sit in air
conditioning all day, except for the
brief treks I make from the car to the office or from the attached
garage to the house. As a receptionist, I sit right near our front
entry and the most popular comments (not especially with me) the last
few days have been, &quot;Wish I had your job...just sitting in this air
conditioning.&quot; Or &quot;Boy, you&apos;ve got it made! You should go outside and
see just how hot it is!&quot; I&apos;m thinking, &quot;I&apos;m not dumb, people, why do
you suppose I&apos;m sitting here in the A/C? I&apos;ve been outside
and
I know enough to &quot;get out of the kitchen&quot; when it&apos;s hot.

 Did you know that air conditioning may
cause you to gain
weight...or, at least, not lose weight? You&apos;re thinking I&apos;m crazy,
but this time I&apos;m not. Your body has to burn calories if your
environment is too cold or too hot for comfort. Burning calories, as we
all know, is what burns up the fat. So keeping a moderate temperature
lets our bodies kind of idle in neutral. Maybe moderation doesn&apos;t work
particularly well in this instance. I&apos;m not saying you should crank
your A/C way down and freeze, or turn it off completely, but it&apos;s
something to think about. Another excuse for gaining weight: moderate
temperature. Thought I&apos;d heard them all.

 The Grapevine 
Two of our Faddassers were in the attic of the building they&apos;re working
on right now. There&apos;s no temperature control up there and one of them
remarked that it wasn&apos;t that hot walking from his truck. Then he added
that the streams of perspiration running down all sides of his body
were &quot;residual.&quot; Residual or not, he&apos;s gotta be pounds lighter by
tonight! 

 Tip for Today 
 It&apos;s good to be &quot;cool&quot;... 
It&apos;s important to keep your body from
overheating in this weather. Like
most auto engines of today, our body&apos;s engine is water-cooled. If you
don&apos;t keep a car engine cool, you could pop a head gasket or crack a
head. Heat is serious business with your body, too. You need to keep
those glasses of water going down your throat. (Not the glasses...the
water. You have to clarify everything to this group or you get notes.)
If all else fails, take off your clothes and cover your body with damp
towels and then sit in front of the fan. Not a mind picture that
everyone wants, but it works. We did it for years before we had air
conditioning.

 Let&apos;s meet at the water cooler... 
If the forecast is right (and after day, it looks like it is), we&apos;re in
for some tropical heat. It&apos;s so important to remember to drink lots of
water. Your body needs it and it isn&apos;t going to affect your weight
unless you drink gallons of it. Your body will run it through your
plumbing and take what it needs. We take the plastic soda bottles and
fill them about a third full of water and put them in the freezer. When
you add cold water in the morning, it will stay cool for a long time.
There isn&apos;t a better beverage out there than water when it comes to
quenching your thirst. And if times get really hot, you can pour it
over your head. (Or someone else&apos;s, depending on the situation.)

 You snooze, you lose...
 Part of a healthy lifestyle is getting enough sleep.
Recent studies show that not getting enough sleep can increase your
weight. Today&apos;s Americans are getting by with less sleep than ever and
research scientists think that lack of sleep might be contributing to
obesity. Sleep debt can cause many physiological changes to the body
and one of them could be the hormonal signals that tell us we&apos;re
hungry. When you can&apos;t sleep, what&apos;s one of the first things you do?
After counting sheep, of course. You head to the refrigerator for the
infamous &quot;midnight snack.&quot;

Do you get eight hours of sleep a night? If not, maybe you need to go
to bed a little earlier. Waking up to the sound of an alarm clock when
you&apos;re so tired all you can think about is how many hours until you can
go to bed again is not the best way to start the day. A well-rested
person can cope with the day&apos;s glitches and coping brings contentment,
which, in turn, contributes to your well-being.

 Whether it has an effect on your weight or not, it
certainly has an huge effect on other phases of your life, so get your
zzzzzzzzs.

 Got a nice message from one of our
Faddassers regarding my recent typo at the end of the Fadd Gram. To
quote: I
think &quot;God loves you and so DO IT!&quot; works just fine. He wants
us to be healthy. Just &apos;cause we&apos;re his children we don&apos;t have to

 Tip for Today 
 Getting enough sleep 
If you can&apos;t get to sleep or, if you wake up in the night and can&apos;t go
back to sleep, don&apos;t just lay there. Sleep
specialists recommend that after 15-20 minutes of sleeplessness, you
get out of bed, go to another room and do something relaxing, like
listening to music or reading. Return to bed when you feel sleepy.
Above all, avoid watching the clock.

&quot;I want beer...lots and lots of beer!&quot; said the third little piggy.

The drinks were brought out and the waiter took their orders for dinner.

&quot;I want a nice big steak,&quot; said the first piggy.&quot;
&quot;I would like a salad,&quot; said the second piggy.
&quot;I want beer...lots and lots of beer!&quot; said the third little piggy.

The meals were brought out and later the waiter approached the table
and asked if anyone would like dessert.

&quot;I want a banana split,&quot; said the first little piggy.
&quot;I&apos;ll have a root beer float,&quot; said the second piggy.
 &quot;I want beer...lots and lots of beer!&quot; exclaimed the
third little piggy.

&quot;Pardon me for asking,&quot; said the waiter, &quot;but may I ask why you&apos;ve only
ordered beer all evening?&quot;

The third piggy replied, &quot;Well, someone has to go &apos;wee, wee,
wee&apos; all the way home!&quot;

 Field of Dreams...
 Remember the movie, Field of Dreams ? Kevin
Costner is told, &quot;If you build it, they will come.&quot; I&apos;ve had something
like that happen this weekend. I&apos;ve been dreaming of Schwan&apos;s fudge
sticks. They&apos;re my favorite food so when the Schwan&apos;s man came on
Friday, I ordered a box of the low-cal ones. He was a sub for the
regular driver and insisted that the box he gave me were the low-cal
sticks. (Well, the sticks were probably low-cal; the fudge on them
wasn&apos;t!) 110 calories per fudge stick. My dream should have warned
me,;&quot;If you buy them, you&apos;ll eat them!&quot; I&apos;m having a tough time staying
out of the freezer. (Didn&apos;t think I&apos;d fit, did you! We have a large
freezer.) So be warned. If you buy it, you probably WILL eat it and if
it&apos;s something you can&apos;t resist, then maybe you need to think about it
before you purchase it. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t buy just one fudge
stick; they come in a box of 24. Oh, boy...I could be in big trouble.
The good news is that pretty soon there won&apos;t be any left to tempt me
and I&apos;ll be over that hurdle...that is, if I can heave myself over the
hurdle with 24 fudge sticks inside me!

 Mark came back from his trip to

 Lyle pointed out to me that I&apos;ve been
signing my Fadd Grams for the past few days with &quot;Remember that God

be &quot;I&quot;. At least I know he&apos;s been reading them! Guess I can&apos;t criticize
anyone&apos;s spelling any more. That should make at least one of
our Faddassers happy. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 Walk the walk... 
If you&apos;re having difficulty finding time to walk, sit down and write
down your daily schedule. When you see it in writing, you may be able
to find a task that can be shortened. Or better yet, find a walking
buddy. If you have to meet your buddy every day at a certain place and
time, it&apos;s much easier to stick with the plan. We don&apos;t hesitate in
letting ourselves down, but we try to not let our friends down.

 Not ON a diet...
 We need to remember once again that we&apos;re not ON a
diet...we&apos;re developing a healthier diet. Last night at the
Friday-Night Bonfire, there was homemade ice cream, and I think almost
everyone had second helpings. That&apos;s just fine. We&apos;ll compensate on
something else because when was the last time you had homemade ice
cream? And when do you think you&apos;ll have it again? You need to seize
the moment when it&apos;s handed to you and be thankful. I seized the
moment, two cups of ice cream and several salads. It was wonderful.
Some of the Faddassers in attendance sometimes looked over their
shoulders like they were committing a felony. We need to not forget
that each of us is on our own personal journey and though we&apos;re
traveling together, we need to set our own pace. We haven&apos;t given up
eating. We&apos;re practicing moderation. We&apos;re eating healthier; and we&apos;re
going to enjoy ourselves, or it isn&apos;t going to work.

So seize those special moments when they happen and I&apos;ll see you &quot;on
the road.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
..Today is Father-Daughter Take a Walk Together Day
..Today is Strawberry Sundae Day
..Today is Chocolate Day

 It&apos;s Fri-i-i-i-i-day...
 That means the weekend is upon us and that&apos;s when the
temptation to eat strengthens. It&apos;s something like the hurricane season
we&apos;re in: the closer the hurricane gets to landfall (the weekend), the
stronger it gets. We get out of our routine and our eating habits
relax. Example: You sleep in late and decide to skip breakfast; you
decide to combine breakfast and lunch and have brunch instead. Then you
think, &quot;That&apos;s actually two meals, so I can eat a little more.&quot; And you
do. Then about 1 o&apos;clock you start to get hungry and decide that maybe
you shouldn&apos;t have skipped lunch after all. So you head for the
refrigerator. Do you see where I&apos; m going with this? (And it&apos;s not to
the refrigerator!)

Stay in your routine. Health articles say it&apos;s best to not change your
sleeping patterns. If you&apos;re tired, get up at your regular time and
then take a short nap in the afternoon. Eat at your regular times. Your
body likes routine.

Think before you eat. Eat in moderation. Exercise. Stick with the plan
and you&apos;ll do okay.


 The Grapevine 
 A couple of days ago I asked for input
on weight loss. Now I have to clarify weight loss again. One of our
Faddassers wrote this: &quot;Can
I count the same two pounds multiple times if they keep coming and
going and coming and going? (There&apos;s the advantage to daily
weighing!)&quot;

The answer, of course, is NO! And I &quot;no&quot; she&apos;s just trying to make a
point. Your beginning weight (choose ONE weigh-in weight) minus your
current weight is what you&apos;ve lost, but since that can change daily,
it&apos;s best to take the weight by weeks. If you first weighed in on
Tuesday, then your &quot;current weight&quot; should also be on a Tuesday. I
know: Rules, rules, rules. But we need to be fair. 
 
 Tip for Today 
 An apple a day... 
If you&apos;re baking, you can substitute unsweetened applesauce for at
least half of the oil in the recipe. You need to do a little
experimenting. I use cake mix to make bars for Lyle&apos;s lunch and the
recipe calls for a 1/2 cup of oil. I substituted the same amount of
applesauce and they turned out delicious. (I had to trim almost a whole
row off to be sure they were okay.)

 That&apos;s what&apos;s happening here. Last night I came home
from a meeting about 9:00 and there was a message on the answering
machine. We&apos;d advertised our camper for sale. I met the interested
parties at the lake last night and sold the camper. We&apos;re moving out

The nice people who bought the camper are going to load everything for

It&apos;s going to be a busy night so I will stress &quot;moderation&quot; in my Fadd

moderation is advisable here, as well..

 Variety is the spice of life 
It&apos;s fruit and vegetable time in Minnesota and the fresh veggies are so
good. Try a little variety in your menu. Here&apos;s a dip that can be used
with raw veggies or even on a baked potato. It&apos;s from the American
Heart Association No Fad Diet book.

 Cucumber and Avocado Dip 
1 medium cucumber
1 small avocado (about 4 ounces)
1/4 cup fat-free or light sour cream
2 teaspoons snipped fresh dill weed or 1/2 teaspoon dried, crumbled
1 teaspoon grated lime zest
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt.

Peel the cucumber and cut in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, remove and
discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber into 1-inch slices. Peel and dice
the avocado. In a food processor or blender, process all the
ingredients until smooth. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerator
for up to two days.

..The bikini swim suit debuted on this day in 1946

 The After-Work Snack Attack 
 Most of us do quite well when we&apos;re in our work
environment. Many of us are too busy to have time to snack and unless
you have a secret stash in your desk drawer or your locker, the
temptation isn&apos;t available. Of course, there&apos;s always the vending
machines, but if you keep yourself low on quarters, that will help.

It&apos;s when we get home from work and relax that temptation jumps out
from behind the door and leads us straight to the kitchen. We&apos;ve had a
long day, nothing is ready, and some of us still have to figure out
what we&apos;re going to have for supper. In the meantime, a handful of this
and a scoop of that; a lick of the spoon and a bite of whatever will
get us through until we can get &quot;real food&quot; to eat. Ever stood in front
of the refrigerator door, ready to eat almost anything that wasn&apos;t
green and fuzzy? And when all else fails, green and fuzzy doesn&apos;t look
so bad? The pre-meal snacks will rack up in a hurry and you&apos;ll have
nothing left for your meal.

The Fadd Gram helps me a lot because it&apos;s the first thing I do when I
come home. It&apos;s hard to think, type and eat at the same time (although I&apos;ve done it). I grab a glass of iced tea, sit down and start
thinking. Busy hands don&apos;t have time to shovel food into your
mouth. I&apos;ve also found that if I have something about 3:30 in the
afternoon, it cuts my appetite quite a bit. I usually have some small
containers of apple sauce in my desk and it&apos;s very tasty about that
time.

 It comes down
to being prepared and getting your mind off of food. If you sit down to
relax, have a cool glass of something low-cal with you. Read the paper
or watch the news; do something that takes your mind off of food.
Veggies and dip are good when you&apos;re hungry. Nuts are full of protein
and energy. Just remember moderation and slam the door on
temptation (and probably the refrigerator, too.)

 The Grapevine 
 If you&apos;ve lost weight, will you let me
know and I&apos;ll post the total amount we&apos;ve lost. It would be so great to
stack empty butter cartons up to show the weight loss, but since we&apos;re
cutting down on fats, we shouldn&apos;t have that many cartons. Look forward
to hearing from you. 

 Tip for Today 
 Adding to subtract 
You need to add some exercise to your lifestyle to get yourself in
shape. It has to be in addition to your normal exercise. If you don&apos;t
have a pedometer, you might want to get one. Begin by adding just 250
steps a day. Walk around the grocery store twice if you have to, or put
on some music and dance. We need to get some action here so we don&apos;t
become couch potatoes. I&apos;ve been parking farther away from my
destination when I can. Inch by inch it&apos;s a cinch. Let&apos;s inch
our way to fitness. (Actually, you may want to take bigger steps
than that!)

When Lena returned in two weeks, she&apos;d lost nearly 20 pounds. &quot;Why

Lena nodded. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you, though, I thought I was going to drop dead
that third day.&quot;

 Detour...there&apos;s a muddy road ahead 
 Detour...there&apos;s a muddy road ahead
Detour...paid no mind to what it said
Detour...oh, these bitter things I find!
Shoulda read that &quot;Detour&quot; sign!

 Back in
the 50s Detour was a popular hit by Patti Page, &quot;The Singing
Rage.&quot; Many of you can identify with the song. This is one of the
most-traveled weekends of the year and, in Minnesota, it is said that
we have two seasons: winter and road construction. We&apos;re well into road
construction season now and it seems like any direction you travel, you
run into a detour. Some of them are long and tedious; some short and
just a small interruption in your travel plans.

I ran into a detour this past week. It started with the meatballs and
ended with the 4th of July weekend. It was a tough week and I found
myself craving food in general. Moderation was my goal, but I didn&apos;t
make it. I
should have read the &quot;detour&quot; signs, but I chose to ignore them and
&quot;muddied&quot; up my eating. So I need to remember: Life happens, but I&apos;m going to
make this detour the short one. I&apos;m going to really put more
effort into getting back on the main highway of moderation. See you
there. Don&apos;t forget to exercise!!

 The Grapevine 
Got a reply from Georgette on yesterday&apos;s bean message. She says there
are more dangers to watch out for with baked beans than just the
digestive interruptions. Baked beans usually have a lot of brown sugar
in them and if there&apos;s bacon, watch the trans fats. Good idea. Just
like all foods, you have to watch what&apos;s been added. 

 Tip of the Day 
 It&apos;s easier to make than to pronounce... 
With all the fresh fruit available, here is a dessert that is healthy
AND tasty. It&apos;s called a clafouti (which is pronounced kla-foo-TEE) and
is of country-French origin. It&apos;s almost like a tart. There&apos;s fresh,
ripe fruit topped with a cake-like batter. Originally, it was made with
cherries, but any fruit works well. One cake makes six servings.

 Fresh Fruit Clafouti 
1-1/2 cups sliced ripe nectarines, plums, peaches, or pitted
cherries (about 10 oz. cut fruit)
2/3 cup fat-free evaporated milk
1 large egg, beaten (or 1/4 cup egg substitute)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt

 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Prepare an 8&quot; glass pie plate with nonstick pan spray. Layer fruit in
the pie plate. Combine the
rest of the ingredients in a food processor or use an electric mixer.
Process until smooth; pour over the fruit. Bake 35-40 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.
Serve warm or at room temperature. At serving time, you can serve it
plain or you may want to sprinkle the cake with a tablespoon of sifted
powdered sugar. Cut into six slices. 
 
One slice has only 92 calories and 1 gram of fat.

 ...Today is Eat Beans Day
..Today is Compliment Your Mirror Day

 Spilling the Beans on Beans 
 Today is Eat Beans Day; very appropriate for the 4th
of July holiday since baked beans have always been a staple of picnic
dinners. If ever there was a food that had a &quot;bad rap,&quot; it has to be
beans. Remember this ditty? &quot;Beans, beans, the musical fruit; the more
you eat, the more you toot.&quot; And there are tons of jokes about the
results of eating beans.

Beans are not only good, they&apos;re good for you. They&apos;re part of
the legume family. (Pronounced leg&apos; yoom . I cringe every time I
hear the word butchered.) When
checking the health books, you won&apos;t find legumes under Vegetables. No,
they&apos;re under the Meat list.

&gt;From the BC Cancer Agency web page:
 Legumes come from plants with seed pods that split on both sides
when ripe. They are inexpensive and easy to incorporate into your
favorite dishes.

Healthy benefits are plentiful - they are a rich source of protein,
complex carbohydrates and fiber, low in saturated fat and important
sources of B vitamins. Most beans are very similar in their
nutritional content and are an excellent source of energy.

These foods are part of the Meat and Alternates food group. One-half cup of cooked legumes (beans and lentils) provides the same
protein as one ounce of meat.

Some examples are:
Beans: Black, kidney, lima, white, pinto, garbanzo (chickpeas)
and soy beans
Peas: Yellow and green split peas (not garden peas)
Lentils: Yellow, red and green 

 So celebrate the day. Get some protein with legumes. And I&apos;m not
saying this because I&apos;m full of beans . It&apos;s because I want to
look more like a bean pole .

 The Grapevine 
 Tomorrow is the start of our 5th week.

you&apos;re certainly celebrating this day! Congratulations! 

 Mark, if you&apos;re reading this in
Phoenix, hope things are going well. 

 Tip for Today 
 Adding beans to your menu 
There are several ways to integrate beans into your daily menu without
anyone even noticing. Start by adding small amounts of beans or lentils
into meat dishes and casseroles. Or add chick peas to salads.

Chili has to be one of the healthiest foods out there, if prepared with
that in mind. Double the amount of kidney beans and halve the amount of
meat. Don&apos;t use tomato soup; use tomato puree or tomato juice. If you
check the nutrition facts on the back of the can and see how much
sodium (salt) is in the product, you might be surprised. Many of us are
fighting high blood pressure and it&apos;s important to watch our sodium
intake.

Senior Moments
 I Forgot Day...that&apos;s a
day I can really celebrate...if I remember. It could have been created
for me. For that matter, it could have been created for Lyle, too. It&apos;s
a celebration for everyone, although the older you get, the more your
expertise seems to increase. Young people have more selective memory
functions. They forget things like when to come home, how to take out
the garbage, that they have homework, and wiping their feet.

Older people laughingly refer to their forgetfulness as &quot;senior
moments.&quot; Well, I&apos;ve had enough of these moments; it must be time to
graduate. 

 Forgetfulness can be
bad, but it can also be good. It&apos;s bad to forget that you&apos;ve already
taken your medicine and take it again. It&apos;s good to forget that you
have a Hershey bar stowed away in the cupboard. It&apos;s bad to forget your
anniversary; it&apos;s good to forget the differences you&apos;ve had.

Forgetfulness happens to all of us eventually. There are times when we
forget moderation; and there are times when we forget to think before
we bite. Forgetfulness can be positive though. Let&apos;s forget about the
second helpings. Let&apos;s forget about the TV. And let&apos;s remember that
we&apos;re in this together and have fun on the journey. (And it&apos;s better
for your body if this is a walking journey and not a riding one.)

I had an uncle who had a potbelly. During a family birthday party, all
the relatives were sitting in the kitchen when he offered to get
something off a high shelf for his sister-in-law. As he reached up and
stretched out, his stomach sucked in and his pants hit the floor so
fast it almost caused a breeze. He had a hard time living that one

 Neither snow nor rain... 
 &quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night
stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed
rounds.&quot; Everyone thinks this is the motto of the U. S. Postal Service,
but they actually have no motto. It was first seen as an inscription on
the New York City Post Office building when it was dedicated in 1914.

Since it is Postal Workers Day, I got to thinking. What if we had that
same dedication to our exercise programs? What would happen to our
excuses?  It&apos;s too hot to walk today. It&apos;s cold and snowy and
I don&apos;t want to slip. It&apos;s raining...I might get hit by lightning! I
don&apos;t like to get up early and it&apos;s too dark when I finally have time .
Our excuses would be gone and we&apos;d be out there walking, biking,
exercising.

If it&apos;s too hot outside, as it is for some of us, do something inside.
Climb some stairs. Put on your favorite music and dance. Lie on the
cool floor and do stretching exercises. Remember jumping jacks? They
were the staple of gym class. All of the gym exercises were inside,
although I admit it was a much larger space. You probably shouldn&apos;t do
laps or play basketball...at least not at my house. I told my kids for
years that our living room was not a gymnasium. Now I have to hide my
smirks as their children leap to touch the ceiling and have races in
their living rooms.

Be dedicated. Be wise. Exercise.

Sabotaged by Meatballs
 This has been a difficult week
for me. I&apos;d been striving for moderation when I was accosted by evil
meatballs on Tuesday. It all started Monday night when we had a
retirement party for one of my fellow employees. The hors d&apos;oeurves
were awesome. When the night was over, the extra food was taken back to
the office and put in the refrigerator. When I opened the fridge door
the next day, there were two huge containers of meatballs right in the
front, waiting for me. They were very tempting, as they lay there in
their silky, red barbecue sauce. The next thing I knew, I was eating
cold meatballs off of a napkin. Didn&apos;t even take the time to pop them
in the microwave. A little voice in my head kept whispering,
&quot;Moderation! Moderation!&quot; A louder voice blew the whisper away,
shouting &quot;Meatballs! Meatballs! Must have more meatballs!&quot; Finally, my
self-control back in place, I left the kitchen, leaving behind a napkin
covered in barbecue sauce that lay on top of my &quot;good
intentions.&quot; I didn&apos;t mean to succumb to those meatballs, but I let
temptation lead me astray. Not only Tuesday, but again on Wednesday,
I&apos;m ashamed to say. Thank goodness the meatballs won&apos;t last 21 days or
they could be habit-forming.

So this is my confession to my fellow Faddassers. I haven&apos;t
practiced what I preached . As always, confession is good for the
soul and I&apos;m heading into the weekend with my self-control in place. I
just hope the meatballs don&apos;t decide to camp in the same campground!

 TIP OF THE DAY
 Veggie
Pizza...you gotta love it!
 One
of the leftovers we had on Tuesday was Veggie Pizza. Every time I eat
it, I wonder why I don&apos;t make it at home. It&apos;s very simple. You can
lighten up the pizza by using low-fat cream cheese and spreading it on
tortillas. Sprinkle on the chopped vegetables and roll it up. No
baking. They&apos;re best if you let them cool in the refrigerator for a few
hours. You can slice them into little spiral-looking pieces and place
them on a plate with the cut-side up or eat them whole. They&apos;re very
good.

 A New Exercise Program 
This is great and really works, I feel fab now !!

At last a sensible exercise program to burn off the calories after
those meatballs.

If you&apos;re over 25, you might want to take it easy at first, then do it
faster as you become more proficient. It may be too strenuous for some.

Always consult your doctor before starting any exercise program.

The Good Old Days
 Today is Remote Control Day. No wonder obesity is spreading
over America. We don&apos;t have to move any more. Everything is at our
fingertips. We don&apos;t have to pump the water, chop the wood and then
heat the water for our morning showers; we don&apos;t have to hunt or fish
or pick or clean or snip to prepare a meal. If we want to, we can just
pop it in the microwave. We walk a few feet to our car, which is
probably in an attached garage, hop in and drive to our destination,
parking as close to the entrance as possible. We take an elevator, if
necessary, and have our purchases carried or carted to our car. Our
dishes go into a dishwasher, the water comes out of the pipes and we go
outside to &quot;get some exercise.&quot; We crawl onto our riding lawnmower, use
our electric hedge trimmer and weed eater, and then go back into the
house to rest after all the exertion of mowing the lawn. We sit in our
chairs, pick up the remote, and disappear into TV land...unless we&apos;re
hungry. Then we have to actually get up and walk to the kitchen and/or
refrigerator. Tough life, right? As Waylon Jennings, said, &quot;It&apos;s time
to get back to the basics...&quot;

Walk to the store, mow the lawn with a walk-behind mower (you don&apos;t
even have to push!), wash the dishes by hand, walk the dog, visit
someone in a nursing home who lives at the end of the hall. There&apos;s all
sorts of things to do to increase your exercise.

Let&apos;s do it! Let&apos;s be wise and exercise.

 The
best diet drink on the market
 The
long 4th of July holiday is coming up (at least for those who have
Monday off) and you may be doing lots of extra outdoor activities.
Don&apos;t forget the best diet drink available...water! It quenches your
thirst better than anything else. Make sure you have a pitcher of ice
water in the refrigerator or have a Thermos jug of it with you so that
it&apos;s easily available. We always need lots of water, but in the hot
weather we need more. Hydrate...hydrate...hydrate. And you don&apos;t even
have to use moderation. Drink until your thirst is quenched.

 Guess what! Fat people burn

finally have an advantage over them. Of course, it makes sense when you
figure that we&apos;re hauling around the equivalent of several 20-lb. sacks
of flour, while they&apos;re skipping freely around unburdened. I don&apos;t know
about you, but I&apos;m getting sick of my &quot;little red hen syndrome&quot; where I
haul all the flour and do all the work. I want to enjoy the results. I
want to get out of WOMEN&apos;s sizes! I don&apos;t want to be &quot;special&quot; anymore.
I want to wear regular misses&apos; sizes and not special sizes. To do that,
I am going to continue my moderation, but I&apos;m going to increase my
activity. If you&apos;re going to increase something, it&apos;s better to
increase your exercise than your helpings!

Let&apos;s do it. Let&apos;s be wise and exercise!

OF THE DAY
 Chicken
out at the last minute?
 Love
my chicken, but did you know that a fast-food fried chicken breast and
drumstick have almost 24 grams of fat? The same amount of rotisserie
chicken (or baked or broiled without the skin) has only about 7 grams
of fat. The choice is a no-brainer and I actually like the rotisserie
chicken better...not so much of that tasteless breading.

PORTION DISTORTION
 The American Heart Association, in their book No-Fad
Diet,  say that &quot;not only are we eating out more often than
before, but we are eating much larger servings than we did 25 years
ago. Portion distortion is a major contributor to many
expanding waistlines.&quot; They show a chart with changes in serving sizes
over the last 20 years. Super-sizing is now the norm. A blueberry
muffin used to be 210 calories; today&apos;s mammoth muffins are 500
calories. Hamburgers used to be &quot;regular&quot; and had about 300 calories;
super-size that and it&apos;s closer to 600. Soda now comes in larger
containers and has gone from 85 calories to 250 calories.
 
 As a result, we&apos;ve come to expect larger portions,
and since we feel that to get our money&apos;s worth, we need to eat
everything, obesity is spreading. (Little pun there.) Miss Piggy once
said, &quot;Never eat anything bigger than your head.&quot; As Faddassers, we
should say, &quot;Never eat anything without using your head...think first.&quot;

The three important steps to a healthy life style, according to the
American Heart Association, are:
 
 Think Smart: Change your mind-set;
change your body Eat Well: Enjoy your life with
healthy food Move More: Ease into an active life
style 
  Our first 21 days are up today and
we should be well on our way to establishing healthier eating habits.
(Studies show that after doing something for 21 days straight, it
becomes a habit.)

Good job, Faddassers!

 TIP OF THE DAY 
 Oil
consumption... 
We Americans consume more oil than anyone in the world, and that&apos;s not
only in our vehicles. When baking and cooking, try cutting down on the
amount of butter, margarine, oil and mayonnaise in the recipe. It&apos;s a
small step that will usually not affect the taste, but will be a big
step for your heart.

Yes, you can eat it...just think smart!
 In our enthusiasm, I think we&apos;re getting away from the fact
that we are not on a diet . Instead, we&apos;re promoting a healthier
life style. All foods are available, but not in the quantities we
previously consumed. Someone may tell you, &quot;No, you can&apos;t have that
food.&quot; That isn&apos;t true, unless you&apos;re being monitored for a
specific health problem like diabetes. You can eat the same foods as
you did before. Just think before you opt for the first bite.

Last night we were over to some friends&apos; home to play whist. Katie
always &quot;puts on a good feed&quot; and we hadn&apos;t been together for 18 months
because of multiple health problems. So, yes, I did have potatoes and
gravy. Yes, I did have a piece of roast pork, and, yes, I had fruit
salad and vegetables. I just scooped out smaller portions. But I
did not have the apple pie and ice cream served later. I COULD
have...it was my option, but I prefer to choose my battles and there
are other things I would rather have than apple pie and ice cream.

I didn&apos;t choose to take one of the chocolate-covered peanuts passed
around at church this morning. That was a difficult choice, but had I
popped one gorgeous, little, chocolate-covered peanut into my mouth, it
would have lingered on my palate and teased and tempted me until I made
Lyle stop on the way home to buy a bag of them for me. I know my body
and I know my temptations, and just like an alcoholic, I don&apos;t take the
first bite (drink).

So, go ahead...eat what you crave, but make a smart choice.

 Hello, fellow Faddassers... 
 ...Today is Flying Saucer Day
...Today is Swim Day
...Today is Celebration of the Senses Day (Food: We can see it, we can smell it, and we can
taste it. Celebrate your senses as you sit and savor your food.) 


 Soda is POPular 
 Soda, soda pop, soft drink...not matter what you
call it, soft drink consumption has increased 135% in the last 30
years. Health experts call soft drinks and fruit drinks &quot;liquid candy&quot;
because they&apos;re so full of sugar. In theory, they say, a soft drink is
really a dessert. In fact, many times a can of pop will contain more
sugar than a sweet dessert. An average 12-oz. can of Coke contains 9
teaspoons of sugar. Soft drink manufacturers are the largest single
user of refined sugar in the United States

Soda has almost no nutritional value and contributes to many health
problems. Studies have proven that sugar increases insulin levels,
which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease,
diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and osteoporosis. Most sodas
include over 100% of the RDA of sugar.

Sugar and water are the main ingredients, but there are often several
others.

Phosphoric Acid: May interefere with the body&apos;s ability to use calcium,
causing a softening of the teeth and bones. It neutralizes the
hydrochloric acid in your stomach. If your digestion is affected, so is
the body&apos;s ability to utilize nutrients.

Caffeine: We all know what caffeine will do. Too much and you can get
jittery and be unable to sleep. It can also affect your heart beat,
your blood pressure and your cholesterol level.

Artificial Sweeteners: Several chemicals are used as sweeteners in diet
sodas. Aspartame has been proven to have a lot of bad
side effects. Splenda (sucrolose), which is advertised as &quot;Made from
sugar, so it tastes like sugar,&quot; is not really sugar once it gets
through the chlorination process. That process makes it very difficult
to digest the sucrolose so it is pushed through the digestive system
and excreted intact. There are several law suits pending about the
&quot;made from sugar&quot; statement.

So, what&apos;s a guy (or a gal) gonna do? The best diet drink is water. It
has no calories, is refreshing, and quenches your thirst. I know, the
pop machines are everywhere, but why not substitute one of these?

My two favorites are Lipton Unsweetened Iced Tea and Mendota Springs
Sparkling Water. I find the little fizz that the sparkling water has
gives me a boost. It also comes in several flavors and has no calories
or sodium.

This has gotten kind of long, but it&apos;s Saturday and you should have
extra time today. Otherwise, you&apos;ll have to read it in stages.

 Remember: Soft drinks are very
addictive. They&apos;re very convenient. They&apos;re very tasty. Drink them if
you must, but remember that you&apos;re drinking &quot;liquid candy.&quot; 

Enough said.

 Hello, fellow Faddassers... 
 ...It&apos;s Fri-i-i-i-day!
..Today is Typewriter Day (You older Faddassers will remember what they are.) 
..Today is Midsummer&apos;s Eve

 Hasten slowly 
 Have you ever eaten on the run? Have you eaten
standing up? Have you had a meal in your vehicle while you&apos;re driving
or riding? I&apos;m afraid most of us have. Until I started taking the time
to think before I ate, my standard breakfast was two pieces of toast
that I polished off in the car while I drove the three blocks to work.
I arrived every day with crumbs on my chest and sometimes a little
peanut butter in the corner of my mouth. I think it all started in
grade school when we had to eat fast or there wouldn&apos;t be time to hit
the playground; and in high school, where we had band practice during
lunch hour. Somehow I&apos;ve gotten away from actually sitting down and
enjoying my food or, if I do sit down, doing something else at the same
time. Did you know that actually chewing your food more than two chomps
is greatly recommended? When you think about it, what good is shoving something down so quickly
that you don&apos;t even taste it? F ood that gets a running start just rushes down
to the hips and the belly. 
   For the next few days, why not trying eating only
when you&apos;re seated at the table or in a dining area? I was going to
leave it at &quot;only when you&apos;re seated,&quot; but I had visions of someone in
a Lazyboy surrounded by food and beverages. Sit down, enjoy the food,
chew it and, as I&apos;ve said before, savor it. Concentrate on the
food and the good taste. If you work on it, I think you&apos;ll be
surprised how many times you&apos;re tempted to grab something...and most of
the time, you&apos;re not even hungry. If you&apos;re going to eat, make it
worthwhile.

Hasten slowly. 

 The Grapevine 
 One of our Faddassers has started to graze
these past few days, and it&apos;s a habit she&apos;d like to break. Your body
needs to be constantly reminded that there&apos;s food available and it will
be nourished on a regular basis. The consensus in the dietary world is
that you shouldn&apos;t go longer than three hours without food. Maybe you
need to eat something more satisfying than fruit and veggies. Any ideas?
 
 Tip for Today 
 Don&apos;t go to the dogs 
Tonight is campfire night for a lot of us and it hurts me to say this,
but if you&apos;re going to roast a hot dog, try a &quot;fat free&quot; or &quot;low-fat&quot;
wiener. Regular hot dogs have almost 16 grams of fat each! And they&apos;re
loaded with sodium.

 A Dieter&apos;s Prayer 
 Lord, My soul is ripped with riot
Incited by my wicked diet.
&quot;We are what we eat,&quot; said a wise old man,
And, Lord, if that&apos;s true, I&apos;m a garbage can.

To rise on Judgment Day, it&apos;s plain,
That at my present weight, I&apos;ll need a crane.
So grant me strength, that I may not fall
Into the clutches of cholesterol.

May my flesh with carrot curls be dated,
That my soul may be polyunsaturated
And show me the light, that I may bear witness
To the President&apos;s Council on Physical Fitness.

And at margarine I&apos;ll never mutter,
For the road to Hell is spread with butter.
And cream is cursed; and cake is awful;
And Satan is hiding in every waffle.

Mephistopheles lurks in provolone;
The Devil is in each slice of baloney,
Beelzebub is a chocolate drop,
And Lucifer is a lollipop.

Give me this day my daily slice
But cut it thin and toast it twice.
I beg upon my dimpled knees,
Deliver me from jujubees.

And when my days of trial are done,
And my war with malted milk is won,
Let me stand with the Heavenly throng,
In a shining robe--size 30 long.

I can do it, Lord, if You&apos;ll show to me
The virtues of lettuce and celery.
Please teach me the evil of mayonnaise,
And potatoes a la Lyonnaise

Barbecued ribs and T-bone steak
Chocolate chip cookies and devil&apos;s food cake
And crisp-fried chicken from the South

Lord, if you love me, shut my mouth.

 Hello,

 ...Today Chocolate Pudding Day
..Today is Auto Race Day 
 Keep healthy snacks in your vehicle!! 
 I had to drive for five hours immediately after work tonight, and had the foresight to throw a whole package of rice cakes in the truck a few days ago. After passing a dozen fast food joints and the stomach started growling, I conjured up every bit of anti-double-whopper c ourage I had and tore into those cakes like it was going to keep the Quaker Company from bankrupcy! I only bought a soda and chocolate chip cookie on the rest of the trip. I know it&apos;s not a huge win in some eyes, but after gaining a pound last week after trying so hard, it&apos;s a small victory for me. I hope this advice saves just one person from certain demise on this &quot;supersize me!&quot; tainted road that we are all on. Someone said this week it&apos;s a journey, not a destination. We could all stand to spend less of it in the drive-thru lane! So throw that trail mix in the glove compartment, and may you forget about it till you need it. Good eatin&apos;! 
 ---Mark Denson 

 I think it&apos;s a HUGE step, Mark. It&apos;s all about thinking before eating. You thought it out and considered the choices and opted for good health. We&apos;re on our third week and will soon reach the 21-day mark...the day when making smart choices should have become a habit. 

 Next week we&apos;re going to focus on the second phase of our journey...movement.

 Got the munchies? 
If you really need a little extra something, try one of these. Frozen
fruit bars, no-sugar fudgsicles, non-fat frozen yogurt, fresh or dried
fruit, hard candy or jelly beans. Some of the frozen treats are as good
as, or even better, than their sugar-saturated counterparts. Or have
what you&apos;re craving, only in a smaller portion. The downside of that
choice is if you&apos;re like I am, one bite and I want to eat more...and
more...and more! When Lyle asks where all the ice cream has gone, what
can I say? I only had a &quot;small portion.&quot; : )

 Hello, Fellow Faddassers...
 ...Today is the first day of summer; the summer solstice
..Today is Cuckoo Warning Day
 
 Cuckoo Warning Day: It&apos;s
believed in the British Isles that if the cuckoos sing today, then it
will be a wet summer. Since we don&apos;t have an cuckoos (of the avian
kind) around here, we probably won&apos;t know. The phrase did bring a TV
jingle to mind: &quot;Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.&quot; It was on every kids&apos; show
when my children were young...one of the more irritating cereal
commercial sounds. I don&apos;t eat Cocoa Puffs, but I do eat Total
Whole Wheat flakes every morning for breakfast. We have a small Corelle
salad bowl that I just fill up (looks like a serving to me!), pour the
skim milk on and eat. Today I thought I would measure it...maybe I
wasn&apos;t getting my full serving! Well, it turned out to be almost two
servings. That&apos;s okay, as long as I am aware of it and am not being
fooled into thinking it&apos;s a serving. When I think of some of helpings
I&apos;ve plopped onto my plate, I sometimes think it&apos;s going to take more
than &quot;moderation&quot; just to get down to a standard size serving. So
double-check your serving sizes until you get familiar with them. You
may not be down-sizing as much as you think!

says you should weigh every day. Taken into consideration
with what Mark said about being very aware of what your intake
is, you see results immediately.

 I did some research, too, and it seems that you are
encouraged to weigh every day once you&apos;re at your goal weight .
They encourage you to &quot;confront your weight&quot; so you won&apos;t be surprised
by pounds that sneak up on you. When you&apos;re in the process of losing
weight, however, most of the sources say to weigh once a week. Although
things like alcohol, drugs and sugar go quickly into your bloodstream,
it takes several days for food to make its way all through your
system. The immediate results you see, may be misleading and can
often undermine your enthusiasm.

However...and this is a BIG however...we are each working on our own,
at our own pace; and in order to be comfortable and to succeed, we have
to do what works best for us. If weighing every day makes you feel
better...more power to you. As for me, I&apos;m sticking to my original
statements about weighing weekly. It&apos;s working for me. 
 
 The Grapevine 
Our mystery Faddasser from yesterday, the one who weighs daily, chatted
with me today and he is getting more comfortable with thinking before
he eats and with moderation. He seemed to think everyone knew who he
was, but I&apos;m sure my hints were subtle enough to cover up his identity.
: ) 

 Tip for Today 
 Put It in Reverse 
Are you finding it harder and harder to get everyone together for an
evening meal? Do you come home from work and just grab what&apos;s handy
because you&apos;re tired? I read about a family who switched their schedule
around. They put food in a crock pot and the family sat down and had
that for breakfast. Then when everyone came home at different times in
the evening, they had cereal for supper. When Moses came down from the
mountain with the tablets in his arms, I don&apos;t think there was anything
in stone that said you had to have cereal or eggs and toast for
breakfast. Give it a try. You have all day to work the meal off. It&apos;s
better than eating a large meal at night and falling into bed and lying
there like a stuffed sausage.

 Hello, fellow Faddassers... 
 ...Today is Butterfly Day
..Today is World Jauntering Day
 
 The end of week two. Can you believe that many of us
have been &quot;moderating&quot; for that long? And no fad diets; no special food
purchases; no weighing; no journaling, unless you want to. It&apos;s great.
Just eat your regular meals, but downsize the serving. We&apos;re so used to
super-sizing everything that when you get a regular serving, it looks
really puny. I went to the doctor today and was weighed. In the last
two weeks I have lost 9 pounds. I am ecstatic. My doctor asked me if I
had a goal in mind, and I said, &quot;No, I hope that sometime I get down to
a smaller size, but for the Faddassers, it&apos;s a journey...not a
destination.&quot; I don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;m having fun on the
journey. The destination will come eventually. 

 The Grapevine
Heard that one of our group did not read the first e-mail, or if he
did, it didn&apos;t register. I won&apos;t say his name, but it is could be an
acronym with &quot;B&quot; on both ends and an &quot;O&quot; in the middle. Here is the
base information again. 
 
Most of the material I&apos;ve read says,“Don&apos;t weigh yourself every day!”Your weight fluctuates, especially in this hot and humid weather. If
you eat in moderation and nothing happens the next day, it&apos;s easy to
become discouraged so for the first few weeks, weigh only once a week.
I&apos;m going to weigh in the morning (Tuesday) and will weigh again at the
same time next week.
 
We&apos;ve got three new e-mail addresses added to our list today. Welcome!

 FAT THEOLOGY
 In the beginning, God populated
the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and spinach, green and yellow
vegetable of all kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy
lives.

And Satan created McDonald&apos;s. And McDonald&apos;s brought forth the
double-cheeseburger. And Satan said to Man, &quot;You want fries with that?&quot;

And Man said, &quot;Super size them.&quot; And Man gained pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her figure
that man found so fair.

And Satan brought forth chocolate. And woman gained pounds.

And God said, &quot;Try my crispy fresh salad.&quot;

And Satan brought forth ice cream. And woman gained pounds.

And God said, &quot;I have sent your heart healthy vegetables and olive oil
with which to cook them.&quot;

And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own
platter. And Man gained pounds and his bad cholesterol went through the
roof.

And God brought forth running shoes and Man resolved to lose those
extra pounds.

And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would not
have to toil to change channels. And Man gained pounds.

And God said, &quot;You&apos;re running up the score, Devil.&quot;

And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat and
brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy centre
into crisps and deep-fat fried them. And he created sour-cream dip
also. And Man clutched his remote control and ate the crisps swaddled
in cholesterol.

And Satan saw and said, &quot;It is good.&quot;

And Man went into cardiac arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers!
 ...Today is Father&apos;s Day
..Today is Go Fishing Day
..Today is Splurge Day

 Hope all you Fathers
and father-figures out there had a good day. If you weren&apos;t as
&quot;moderate&quot; as you&apos;d have liked to be, don&apos;t worry about it! Tomorrow is
another day and there&apos;s a nice, clean slate out there. Just start over
and get on with it. We&apos;re zooming in on the end of week two and Tuesday
will be &quot;weigh day&quot; again. I&apos;m really anxious to see what happens
because the first week you always lose a lot of fluid and the second
week tells the true story. Someone has said that the second week of a
diet is easier because by then you&apos;ve quit the diet. : )

That&apos;s often true for a lot of the restrictive diets out there. Not so
with us. We are not dieting. We are developing a new, healthy
lifestyle. I haven&apos;t made any special purchases since I started. I&apos;ve
still got the same grocery list, although I may have crossed off a few
things.

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers!
 ...Today is Eat Your Vegetables Day
...Today is World Juggling Day
...Today is Sweden-America Day

 Day 12...and it&apos;s Eat
Your Vegetables Day. How timely is that? Since there&apos;s only two of us
and since we never know what time Lyle will get home in the evening,
it&apos;s been very easy to just &quot;grab something&quot; for supper and that
usually isn&apos;t vegetables. We don&apos;t always have a sit-down meal and a
lot of the time, I eat when I get home and he eats when he gets home.
Cooking sprouts or cauliflower seems like too much work. I&apos;ve been
buying raw veggie trays from Bill&apos;s and keeping them in the
refrigerator and that helps. Sometimes 5 servings of fruit and
vegetables seems a little overwhelming, but when you look at the
charts, a serving is only a 1/2 cup of vegetables or 1/2 cup of fruit
juice. Our servings are usually larger, so you may be eating more fruit
and vegetables than you think.

If you &quot;carrot&quot; all about yourself, eat some veggies today to
celebrate. Faddassers is about YOU and it&apos;s not a diet. We&apos;re making
healthier choices IN MODERATION.

 When I get a new e-mail address, I usually send all of the
previous Fad-Grams so we&apos;re all in the same pew, so to speak. I&apos;ve put
them all together and am going to make a pdf file that I can attach to
e-mails. I&apos;m also going to add Faddasser to my web site, which is www.hoidal.com .
It would save a lot of printing. The only thing is, I update the page
about every two years and it takes a while for it all to come back to
me. I&apos;m old, but I&apos;ll get it done...eventually!

 Today&apos;s Tip 
 Spray Away
 Last night on TV, I saw an ad for Wish Bone Spritzers. Your
salad dressing comes in liquid form in a spray bottle and you just
spritz it on your salad. One calorie per spray. Did a little research
and found that the first ingredient is high fructose syrup, so if
you&apos;re diabetic or watching your sugar intake, don&apos;t get carried away
with the spray.

Reviews from consumers said the Balsamic Breeze was the best tasting.
The Italian was a little too sweet. They also reminded us to shake the
bottle before using because the dressing contains a lot of water.

For myself, I&apos;ve discovered Balsamic Vinegar this week and have
sprinkled that on my salads. Not bad...not bad at all. (Try it before
you wrinkle your nose.)

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers!
 ...This is National Iced Tea Month
..Today is Recess at Work Day

 Here we are on Day
11...almost two weeks. Ten days and we should have our eating
habits rearranged. I don&apos;t know about you, but they&apos;ve really gone
quickly for me. I haven&apos;t had to attend any meetings; I haven&apos;t had to
run to the grocery to get special foods; and I haven&apos;t felt really that
hungry. Oh, there were times when I thought I might be a little hungry,
but I think it was all in my head.

Evenings seem to be the most tempting time for most of us. We need to
get some hobbies. If you&apos;re busy, you don&apos;t have time to eat. Crafts,
knitting, crocheting, reading, games, doing dishes, straightening the
junk drawer, computer surfing...all of these things could keep your
mind off the hunger that isn&apos;t actually there. And...dare I say
it?...you could even sit down and read the Bible or do some devotions.

Busy hands don&apos;t have time to stuff food in your mouth and busy minds
don&apos;t have time to think about food. 
 
 Grapevine
 When I was in Hutchinson last night, Shopko had a sale on their
digital scales so I thought I&apos;d invest in one. Tonight I was sitting in
Smith Park talking with my son Scott and I said that I&apos;d gotten a
digital scale and it was 30% off. Without blinking, he said, &quot;Do you
think that&apos;s fair to the others?&quot;

I should have said 30% DISCOUNT.
 
 Today&apos;s Tip 
 How Sweet It Is!
 One of the biggest cracks in our moderation sidewalk is soda pop,
soda, soft drinks or pop...whatever you call them. You all know that
&quot;just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot; Well, the more
sugar, the more possibility that you&apos;ll have to have more medicine.
Diabetes is one of fastest growing diseases for all ages. Did you know
that a 20-oz. bottle of Coke contains over 1/4 cup of sugar? That&apos;s 12
teaspoons. Food labels usually show sugar in grams and that&apos;s
confusing to most of us. To find out how many teaspoons, divide the
grams by 5. We&apos;ll talk about artificial sweeteners later. They&apos;re
not all they&apos;re cranked up to be either and no one knows for sure how
safe they are.

 Hi,

 ...Today is Sneak a Kiss Day (That would NOT be a Hershey kiss!)
..Today is Smile Power Day
..Today is a Friend in Need Is a Friend Indeed Day

 A friend in need..we&apos;re
all friends in need. Mark Denson sent a message to me that I&apos;ve printed
in the Grapevine below. We need to talk with each other. You should
have everyone&apos;s e-mail address on this Fad-Gram so keep in touch.

Mark brings up another very good point. If you don&apos;t think about what
you&apos;re eating, you have a tendency to graze. Ever grabbed a handful of
old Halloween candy when you went by the plastic pumpkin in November?
Didn&apos;t really want it; it didn&apos;t really taste that good; it was just
there. Ever gotten up from eating a full meal, feeling stuffed as
a Thanksgiving turkey, and and 15 minutes later stood in front of the
refrigerator with the door open, wondering what there was to eat?

If it isn&apos;t something you really want; something you need; or something
you&apos;re not that fond of, don&apos;t eat it. Think first . This sounds
so obvious, but I think we&apos;re all guilty of it.
 
 
 Grapevine 
 From Mark Denson: 
 I am still 225, same as a week ago, but the good newsis... because of that fact, Bob sat me down and wewent through all that I ate yesterday. I didn&apos;t think I ate that much, but after going through everything, I found I received all 2800 calories I require, plus 3 times as much fat as I need! So now I am watching everything! I am telling you this as a testimonial that we need to really talk to each other and help each other out. I am happy to report today, so far, I probably only ate...at the most...half of what I needed!!!! Oh, and I stopped at the store and picked up some no fat, lite 85 yogurt and skim milk. It&apos;s really good for you. Wish me luck. Feel free to share this with anyone who will listen. Thanks for your help, Jean and Bob!

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers!
 ...Today is Flag Day
..Today is Family History Day

 Family History Day. My family
history is short-lived. Both of my parents and all of my grandparents
died at ages younger than I am now. From all the reading I&apos;ve done,
I&apos;ve found out that family history does indeed play a part in your
health, but a lot of times it can be remedied or reversed by a
healthier life style. And what is the first remedy suggested? Lose
weight. I declare, if I went into the doctor&apos;s office with something in
my eye, they would weigh me and then tell me that it would be easier to
remove if I lost weight. And, they&apos;re right about that...not the eye
deal, but the losing weight. My three medical problems right now are
blood pressure, bad knees and reflux. All of these will be greatly
improved as I lose weight.

&gt;From the American College of Rheumatology: “The accumulated reduction in knee load for a 1-pound
loss in weight would be more than 4,800 pounds per mile walked,”notes
Stephen P. Messier, Ph.D., the leading author of the study on
Osteoporosis and Weight.“For people losing 10 pounds, each knee would
be subjected to 48,000 pounds less in compressive load per mile walked.
Although there are no longitudinal studies indicating that weight loss
in humans slows the progression of knee OA, a reduction of this
magnitude would appear to be clinically relevant.”

 Kick that around for awhile. Wow! 
 
 Grapevine 
 Still haven&apos;t heard much about weight loss so
I&apos;m assuming (which one should NEVER do) that things didn&apos;t go that
well. I know Gail lost. I hate the word &quot;lost&quot; because it makes you
sound like a loser, which you are if you lose, but winner would be much
more positive! Every day is a new day and you start over, that&apos;s what&apos;s
so great. 

 Today&apos;s Tip
 You don&apos;t know the HALF of it!
 Hungry for a burger? Have one . Here&apos;s a couple of
ways to make the burger more healthy. Take the top of the bun off and
toss it. Take a napkin and use it to soak up any fat on the burger.
Then cut the burger (along with the bottom half of the bun) in half and
put the two halves together. It&apos;s like a double burger. It tastes just
as good and you&apos;ve gotten rid of a lot of excess fat and calories that
you don&apos;t need.

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers!
 
 ...Today is Kitchen Klutzes of America Day
 ...This is
Meet-a-Mate Week (There you go, Mark. Better tell Uncle Dan about
it, too.) 
..This is Hermit Week (Probably won&apos;t meet-a-mate if you celebrate
this week too much.) 
 
 Can you believe it? For
those of us who started together, we&apos;ve got one day down on our second
week! How did &quot;weigh day&quot; go for you? It was great for me. I weighed
twice because I couldn&apos;t believe it, but I do have to confess that when
I got on the scale last Tuesday, I had run out of my &quot;water pills&quot; for
my blood pressure. Got the refill this weekend so that may have
something to do with it, but hey! I&apos;ll take whatever I can get.

I was thinking today that we&apos;ve had tips and devotions and all kinds of
things to motivate us, but have we forgotten the best help of all? We
need to pray that we&apos;ll be able to &quot;remodel&quot; our temples so that God is
pleased. Sometimes I think that God doesn&apos;t really want to hear all my
feeble little pleas, but in my heart I know that He is always
there for me and with His help, all things can be easier. Think about
that when you&apos;re tempted to eat something that you don&apos;t really need.
Can you imagine a deep voice saying, &quot;I said, just say no!&quot; I
can. I think I can then hear a little chuckle because I truly believe
God has a great sense of humor.

 Pick your battles 
We&apos;re into moderation here and we don&apos;t have to give anything up that
we don&apos;t want to...we just have to have smaller portions. Craving
chocolate? Don&apos;t settle for a handful of chocolate chips or peel off a
piece that has melted to the seat of your car.

Have a piece of your favorite kind. Sit down and enjoy it. Chew it.
Savor it. Then forget about it. Get on with your life. (In moderation,
of course.)

 Got this
e-mail from Bob after yesterday&apos;s tip that mentioned a serving of meat
was about the size of a deck of cards. 
 
 Is the
deck of cards to be laid out end to end or side by side, in a square or a rectangle,
because it makes a difference in the size of meat I eat. 
 
 No, Bob, it is
just the standard deck with the cards all piled up...and not the
jumbo-size either that geezers have to use. (Old folks...you gotta love
them!)

 
 Today&apos;s Tip
 Eat like a baby 
 Dieticians recommend that you eat every three hours, just like a
baby. And baby-size portions...not a three-course meal. Just something
to keep your blood sugar stable. I eat breakfast about 7:30 and then
have to take my lunch break at 11 so I get a little shaky about 3 PM. I
need to have some V-8 or raw vegetables with me. I&apos;ve also thought
about apple sauce because it doesn&apos;t have to be refrigerated. Look
around...I&apos;m sure you can find something healthy to get you

 HOW TO USE BATHROOM
SCALES 

 When using bathroom scales, these
simple rules must be followed: 

 1. Always place the scale on thick
shag carpeting. 

 2. Hold tightly onto the sink or
shower rod (both when possible) and gradually release the weight of the
body onto the scale. 

 3. Make sure needle placement is
accurate by cautiously adjusting the little round knob on the
centre-front, very slowly to the left. (Zero is a wide number and
should be treated accordingly.) 

 4. WARNING: Stay away from digital
scales. (They are not properly adjustable and therefore inaccurate.) 

 5. Do not weigh yourself
constantly. Every time you stand on the scales it stretches the little
springs and wing nuts inside and slowly presses them flat. the result,
even with no weight gain whatsoever, is that the scale makes you appear
to weigh a little more each time.

 Hi,
fellow Faddassers! 
 ...Today is Day 6
..Today is Full Moon Day

 It&apos;s
interesting to me that this is World Hunger Awareness Week and here we
are, trying to come up with ways NOT to each so much. The more &quot;mature&quot;
of us, as Pastor Bob would say, grew up with this admonition: &quot;Clean
your plates. There are children starving in Europe.&quot; And so we cleaned
our plates and became members of the Clean Plate Club. The Clean
Plate Club had no meetings, no officers, no anything. If you cleaned
your plate, you automatically became a member. That was it. It would have
been nice to have a uniform or a beanie, but the only beanies were
those we just cleaned up. I think the Moms of America were probably the
unofficial board of directors. It&apos;s alright to clean your plate, but
only if it isn&apos;t heaping. Remember that our motto is Moderation .
Avoid temptation with moderation. 

 Grapevine 
 We&apos;ve added several new e-mail addresses for
our fad-grams so welcome to those of you who are just joining us. Mark
gave a splendid testimonial in church today when he said his
cholesterol dropped 26 points on the second day. Just goes to show how
misleading things out of context can be. He didn&apos;t tell us that he&apos;d
been watching his diet and eating healthier for the past six months. : ) 

 Today&apos;s Tip 
 Nice to Meat You 
One serving of meat is not a slab. It&apos;s a piece of meat about the size
of a deck of cards. One serving of meat is 4 oz. raw meat, poultry or
fish...3 oz. cooked. According to that, I&apos;ve eaten about a week&apos;s worth
in one T-bone.

 Did any of the rest of you smell like a smoke

did), but the smoke was so strong that I finally got up and showered.
Today I have real funky hair.
   Gail...the salad was awesome. I&apos;m going to look for
dried cranberries. Did you make those little &quot;muffin things?&quot; They were
were SO good.
   Actually, I really liked the meat loaf, too. I
didn&apos;t see any marbling in it so it must have been pretty fat-free. I
made chili for grazing today and after thinking about it, decided to
not &quot;accessorize&quot; my serving(s) with sour cream and cheese. It&apos;s a
sacrifice, but I&apos;m worth it. : )

I&apos;m going to send this (and the others) to David because he sounded
like he wanted to be part of the group. It will give him a chance to
get up-to-speed with the rest of us. Also, do Rollie and Jeannie have

 Today&apos;s Tip
 Crackers count.
 One serving is not the whole box or even a sleeve of crackers.
Read the label and munch accordingly. (A serving of Nabisco Saltine
Crackers is five crackers for a total of 60 calories. On the front of
the box it says: Sensible Snacking. No cholesterol. No saturated
fat. Contains 1.5g fat per serving.

time to weigh in. No matter what happens, we&apos;re in this together.
Knowing that you three are out there fighting the same temptations
gives me more self-control. Thanks for that.

 Thanks for the input, Mark. Sounds like you&apos;re
&apos;way ahead of us on this healthy eating thing. Bob mentioned that he
was a little discouraged when he found out that 15 minutes of bicycle
riding only burned 97 calories. The one that really throws me is one I
heard on WCCO several years ago. You would have to climb 500
stairs to burn off the calories in one pat of butter. Dry toast sounds
a WHOLE lot better when you think of that. See you guys tonight at the
bonfire. Can&apos;t imagine how we can have one in this wind, but we&apos;ll see.
The wind has been pushing me around and when that happens, you KNOW
it&apos;s a strong wind! 

 Today&apos;s Tip
 Food choices are not all that complicated...you do just need to
eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and go easy on
the junk food. But to do this, you will first have to recognize and
then deal with, the hidden ways in which food companies promote the
opposite. ---What to Eat by Marion Nestle 

Example: You buy hamburger that says 80% lean. Sounds healthy,
right? But, in fact, that means it&apos;s 20% FAT and that&apos;s a lot of fat.
The marketing makes everything sound low cal and healthy. You have to
really read the labels and do some calculating.

 Hi, fellow Faddassers!
Day three and only 18 days to go until this &quot;moderation&quot; is easier.
They say if you do something every day for 21 days, it will become a
habit and so we&apos;re well on our way.

 Great to hear that Mark&apos;s cholesterol dropped
26 points! That is awesome. Good job, Mark. What did you do? We need
input here! 

 Today&apos;s Tip
 You can&apos;t pick it up at the grocery store, but attitude is everything .
 Even something as small as using one pat of margarine on toast
instead of your usual two will save 4 grams of fat every time you do
it. It&apos;s a small step, but every step counts. And all the steps
together add up fast!

 Day
2
 Hi, Faddassers...

So...how did day 2 go with you? It went pretty well with me. I did have
lunch with a friend and we met at the Pizza Ranch, but I only had one
plate and it wasn&apos;t heaped and, as you know, their plates are pretty
small! (You can justify just about anything if you try.)

Glad to hear that things are looking better for Mark&apos;s Mom, and I have
another praise. Taylor Donahue is holding her own after almost six
hours of surgery. The doctors said it was a nightmare for them, but a
dream for her because had the injury been in just a little bit
different place, they&apos;d be waiting for transplants. She has tubes
sticking out everywhere and goes in and out of a coma, but it looks
like she&apos;ll recover. Keep on praying.

 Seven Principles of Success 
1. It is okay to fail (We just start over the next day)
2. Don&apos;t be afraid to start. (We HAVE!)
3. Dare to dream big (or in our cases, smaller)
4. Don&apos;t be afraid to try something new
5. Take things one step at a time
6. Keep moving forward
7. The only thing that can stop you is you!

I&apos;m really tired so I&apos;m going to bed, but hang in there. We can do
it...if we have to...whatever they say at &apos;Possum Lodge.

 Day
1
 Faddassers! Fadassers! Which way to spell it?
 Here
we go with our first Faddasser bulletin. Like I said in the
&quot;announcement&quot; e-mail, I think it needs to be a change in life
style...not a diet. Something that we can do without preparing lots of
different foods and keeping copious notes of quantities and amounts.

 
 First of all, this is not a diet. We&apos;re going
to change our life style by moderation. If you make two trips to the
Grand Buffet hot tables normally, then next time just make one trip. If
you have two slices of toast for breakfast...try having one and more
juice. I have a friend in Danvers who lost over 40 pounds in about four
months doing that. Of course, guys have a better metabolism so they
usually lose faster. That means I&apos;ll have to work a little harder and
I&apos;m not into that, but let&apos;s see what happens. (I can always use that
as an excuse.)
 Most of the material I&apos;ve read says, Don&apos;t
weigh yourself every day ! Your weight fluctuates, especially in
this hot and humid weather. If you eat in moderation and nothing
happens the next day, it&apos;s easy to become discouraged so for the first
few weeks, weigh only once a week . I&apos;m going to weigh in the
morning (Tuesday) and will weigh again at the same time next week.
Mark, I hope this is being forwarded to you. Drink lots of water. It&apos;s very important
always, but especially during this hot weather. When you start losing
weight, your body needs to move the toxins out of your kidneys and out
of your body. And finally, this is just a suggestion, but I
think it would be fun to journal our journey. Write down what you ate
(not portions, unless you want to) and any comments. It will be fun to
look back and see how it all started...PLUS, if the scale doesn&apos;t go
down as fast as we like, we can look back and see if we can made some
adjustments. (Moderately, of course.)
 
 That&apos;s all for tonight.
Let&apos;s get started and we can e-mail back and forth to all of us.

pronounced FADEassers and nothing has faded yet. )
