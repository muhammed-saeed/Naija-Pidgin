How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

It is an unbelievable thing that students go to College for 2,4,6, and even 10 years to attain a job that may feel makes the student feel that they are going to make a difference. Although, attaining a formal education is highly esteemed, paying the loan on the other hand is not the favorite part of attaining an education.


Many students struggle after attaining their education in the&quot;Real World&quot;to find find a position pretaining to their education. One may reason,&quot;If I don&apos;t find a job, then I will never be able to pay off my student loan!&quot;This thought has crossed every students mind from one time to another. The truth of the matter is just about every college graduates start off with $25,000 in debt and without a job that graduate will remain in debt.

I believe that to keep this from happening there should be a program at the college or a program that the government provides to work off college graduate&apos;s debt. That program could involve cleaning the surround area of the college and college grounds, cleaning parks, or helping to make roads. Whether it be any of the above choices, I believe that some sort of program should be in place for the students who cannot find jobs to be able to pay off their loans.

Since it is the graduates responsiblity to pay off these loans, they must either obtain a job or participate in that program offered. Only then should the student start to pay of the loan in the amount of labor done or the percentage of money being made and must be paid off less than 10 years. This allows time for the student to either pay off completely or have the fruits of their labor completed to fufill the debt amounted.

Sad to say that most students today that go to college to get an education end up with a huge debt after they have graduated. Some type of solution has to be made to solve this problem, because not every student finds a job right away after graduating to pay off their loans. I mean banks give out loans knowing that most of those students will not be able to pay it back right away.

I believe that a way to fix the problem would be by opening up more jobs to graduated students. What I mean is that there should be a lot of small businesses that should open around the campus or just near the college, that particularly hires students in debt, for example restaurants, cafe&apos;s, hang out spots,etc... I don&apos;t know if the idea is realistic, but I know those small businesses would have a lot of customers because students around the campus are always looking for a place to study, eat, and see their friends. It would be a way of giving jobs to students who have to pay off their debt and getting a lot of customers at the same time which will provide more jobs.

Also a loan should not take a long time to pay off, but it depends on how much the person may work and how much they get payed. In the end, with more job openings it&apos;ll give the student the guarantee that their loan is going to get payed off, and by giving them the opportunity to get hired at a place that is willing to take mostly students who are in debt than maybe the banks will finally start getting their money back on time and students will have a way of getting rid of their debt quicker.

This topic is a great question that should be brought up in every college or university in the United States, and graduating seniors in high school. Many student go off to college and take out a bunch of loans to pay for school. At the time the student is worrying about the long run because all they see is the money at the moment. After they graduate they see how much debt their actually in and start looking for that career job.

Not everyone finds a job after graduation and cant afford to live on their on so thats why so many college graduates move back home with their parents. What needs to be done about this situation is, upon graduation, students should be required to find a job in their major and start interning with that company and have a secure spot when finished with school. This would be a great solution for having a job in your career after graduation.

As for paying back loans, it shouldn&apos;t take long to pay them back as long as you work and make a decent salary. Like I stated earlier, some students take out more money than they actually need making their debt even more deeper. Needless to say, If there were more jobs available for college graduates, student loans would be paid back more faster than a grad that cant find work. If there were companies out there willing to hire college graduates then it would help the company by expanding its brand, and help the student by making a decent salary and start paying back student loans.

Many college students are ready to finally work on there degrees so they can live better lives, that they go out and ask for numerous loans without getting fully informed, causing for the debt percentage to increase. It&apos;s amazing to see how more students are drowning in debt because of school loans and yet nothing is being done in order to decrease the numbers. Rather then lowering the schools tuitions they have raised the prices reflecting on the percentage of students in debt.


It should be in everyone’s concern for students to pay off there student loans. Schools could get more involved and help the students find internships in order to get a foot in the door and possibly have the opportunity to have a secure job once they graduate. For those that aren’t able to find internships the government can open up a few business that are only intended for college students in order for them to pay off there loans a lot quicker.


As for paying back loans the students income should be looked at in order to make a reasonable decisions of how long it should take them or when to start. The sooner students start paying off the loans the sooner they’ll be out of debt, but without making suitable changes the number wont decrease but increase more each time.

The unfortunate reality is that without an education your job prospects are limited, but the same rings true for having an education. The degrees that are now being obtained are overpriced with many areas oversaturated, such as law degrees and degrees in mass communication. Additionally, there are degree programs that do not correlate with the job market, such as health care administrators and human resource administrators, which are usually staffed by people who have worked up through the ranks instead of the new graduates in their 20’s, although the person who filled the position may have obtained a degree in Healthcare Administration and Human Resources. Additionally, the human resources field is being outsourced to companies that specialize in software programs to manage their human resource needs.
Prior to starting a degree program, one should research the field to determine the need in the area where they reside or would like to reside, the cost of that degree and the projected salary for that degree. Once taking these things into consideration, then a decision should be made as to whether they will really benefit financially, professionally and personally in their chosen field.

Due to the cost of schools, most people must take out loans to pay for school. Prior to the increase in the cost of school, one could take out a Stafford loan in addition to scholarships and grants, which would cover tuition, books, fees and housing, and at the end of the term they would receive the remainder of the funds that were not spent. Now the funds that can be obtained for college does not cover the costs of tuition, books, fees or housing and unsubsidized loans must be obtained including Parent Plus loans.

Going back to the last blog, I reiterate that jobs need to be brought back to the United States and not outsourced to other countries. This will create jobs that are needed by college graduates, former military personnel and those who have been downsized or laid off.

Repayment of student loans should be based on the degree earned and the earning potential of that degree with a graduated/escalated payment plan. The interest on student loans is capitalized yearly when the monthly payments or interest payments are not paid. This needs to be revamped to keep the total amount of the loans at a level where the graduate student can afford to repay the loan in a timely manner, whether this is 10 years, 15 years or 20 years.

“A plan to create new jobs and pay back college loans”
In order to create new jobs to grow our economy, the legislative and executive branches of government both have to bail out the big industrialized companies from bankruptcy, provide free grant and subsidized loans to boost up small businesses, charter railroads’constructions, and establish other government jobs. Actually, many graduate students are not working nationwide, and they have been looking for jobs in every state and cannot find any employment to satisfy their physiological needs; on the merits, politicians are playing tactful games instead of trying to really solve our economic issues. They have barely touched on economic problems, which has been always the case Throughout American governmental history. Once they get in federal offices, they have already forgotten their promises made to the people during the election process.

From my own perspective, student loan program is very helpful, but our governmental lenders should eliminate or reduce the unsubsidized loan interest and work with Congress to pass a“tuition reduction budget”for college and university students so that we as student will pay less tuition and will not owe too money to pay back after graduation. Most graduates are currently working for companies in which they’re being offered a lower wage than their major’s valuable average, which makes no sense to me to have a 4-year or 6-year college degree and be working in dishwasher for only $ 7.35 per hour. How will I be able to pay for my basic bills and my loan?

Let’s wake up students! This is not a joke, and the economic situation is getting tougher and worse; it’s time for us to act (mobilize) because we are getting more debts and do not really know when and how we will pay our student loans off.“Nothing will be beneficially given to us unless we students fight for it”, and let’s not forget our civil rights’movements.

The prospect of paying back a tuition that has increased 600% in the past 20 years is super scary. Most people can&apos;t pay back a credit card payment on time, and banks expect timely payment for highly inflated college loans? Normaly payment for student loans begin 6 months after you graduate from your chosen institution, but for most graduates that time period is just the beginning of their new lives. Six months goes by with a blink of an eye when your hitting the pavement looking for a job under your degree. Perhaps you have some money saved, but how far will it take you. Banks should allow students up to a year to find a suitable job, or atleast one that pays enough that it allows you to pay back a loan.

With the question of how to make jobs for those students, its a logical answer. Bring back the jobs taken to foreign countries. Manufacturing, customer service, and many other jobs have flown the coop because of cheaper taxes and labor costs. The government needs to make the domestic job market look appealing and suitable to economic growth.

Additionnally, I think the government should invest into industries that solve more than one problem. For example, with an increase in&quot;green jobs&quot;not only would more jobs be created, but sustainable power and products would benefit the environment.

In oreder to create jobs for stuents that have just graduated should have been directed to create jobs. Creativity and business sense does not seem typical of a formal education. Most students graduate without skills but with knowledge within the field they studied. Knowledge they would ideally use while in a career within their field of study. Students should be trained in business and what it takes to create business in the field which they have studied. Formal education simply measures the students capacity to learn. This demonstrates to a possible employer their potential to perform.

A student should have to pay tward their loan as soon as they graduate, especially if they still are being funded by the government. The loan payment should be based on the students ability to pay. I believe that students should be held accountable for some payment wheather its significant or not. I believe the amount should also be based on the lifestyle the student chooses to live.

When jobs are scarce as they are today graduates as any other citizen should be required to look for work. Work that may or may not be within their fied of study. Many students obtain a degree and apply for work that may have nothing to do with their major. Income level should indicate how long it should take to pay back their loan.

I also think that the government should help build new business by lightening the load of taxation on new business. Unfortunately the government seem to know little about creating successful companies. Government jobs seem to be the least efficient use of tax monies.

This is a problem that affects mostly all graduating students. These students have to not only worry about finding a job, but also paying off there student loans. However, there is little being said or done to resolve this issue.

I think it should be the Schools responsibility to find the students a job so they can pay back there loans. When the student is on there last semester of school I think it should be the Schools responsibility to find the students a job so they can pay there loans. Also, the Government should open institutions that will hire the student right after graduation and the institution should specifically hire College Kids only.

During this time of work the newly Graduated student can work at this institution for 1 year where they will have a certain amount of deduction that will go directly to paying of the student loan, but also having enough to survive on there own. This method of paying off their student loan should go through to when nearly 15-20 % is paid off. After that it should be their own responsibility to find a job and pay their debts on their own. when they leave this facility new graduating students will take there place at that institution paying off there debt.

The thought of going to college to attain a better job is faulty; especially in todays economy. A professor of mines once told me that college students are the poorest class in america, below infants, but yet college loan debt is higher then credit card debt, and the cost for college books are 600% over inflation. this problem has gone on for much too long, and needs to be corrected.

Firstly, we the people of the united states need to come together as one, and elect the right congressmen to run the country. We need the politians that are concerned with the future, and the current issues that jeoparidize the generations to come. There needs to be proactive politians that can recognize a problem, and be willing to find a solution. After all, college students today, are the leaders of tomorrow; so if those students aren&apos;t properly prepared and equipted with an adequate education that is suffient enough to alleviate the U.S. out of the current situation, then the future seems bleak.

In my opinion the best solution to this crisis would be for the government to issue college graduate grants. The government gives a ton of money to novice unfortunate college students that are pursuing a better education, so why not lend a helping hand to those that have endured a grueling stressful four years of college, and triumphed? College Grads have been put to the test and were victorious. If anyone can commit to school, and not give up, then there should be a recompense waiting for them at the finish line.

Jobs can be created after students graduate by the government creating a program that matches graduating students with job opportunities in companies. Companies would voluntarily sign up with the program. They would get certain benefits for being involved like tax cut for employing graduating students. Students with the appropriate degrees would just need to a fill out a form online. Then the government would notify the student of any job opportunities in which they meets the required criteria’s. Student would then apply for job. This way student would be able to find job opportunities right after graduating allowing them to start paying their student loans.
The best method for paying student loans I think would be for student to start paying after getting a job. But the job must meet a certain criteria which is that student should be able to pay off their student loans, over a ten year period using 10 percent of their salary. As long as the loans interests rates don’t increase and student are able to pay off large sums of the loans when they can this ideas would be efficient.
I recognize there may be certain flaw with my ideas but I truly believe that it is one of the most efficient ways to deal with student loans. Instead of changing the whole system which could take years, we should try and resolve the problems that it has by finding an innovating solutions. By going about it this way everyone is happy the banks and the students.

first of all i would like to say that i don&apos;t think i would ever pull a student loan because i feel like its not worth the education. for example if i were to not go to school at all and work for myself i could make twice as much money as the loans the student has accumulated by the time of graduation. now the student has graduated and is looking to start their life with there degree which some students don&apos;t even succeed to do anything with the degree they have. people are paying way to much for school and its unnecessary.
i think the best ways to start jobs for people is by opening new places all the time such as hospitals and court rooms. i also think that wherever a student pulls their loan from should guarantee them a job after they graduate. which would also benefit the bank the loan was pulled from because it will actually be payed off. i think which ever school the student attends should guarantee the student a job in the field they are practicing. you pay so much money for all the education that you should expect to be offered a job right after you graduate, which is unfortunately not always the case.
i really dont like to owe anyone anything, especially money. so i would suggest the student to pay off the loan he/she pulls as soon as possible. if i ever had to pull a student loan i would not pull another loan till the first one was payed off. which is what i would suggest to someone who has a student loan. if you pay off the loan in small incraments it wont be that much of burden when you receive have your degree. i much rather pay off 4,000 dollars, or as close as possible to 4,000 dollars at a time instead of 30,000 dollars once you graduate.

Its unfortunate that so many students in america graduate with so much debt and no means to pay it back. Students spend so much time in school trying to futher their education to have a better quality of life but after school it almost seems like it wasnt worth it. There are many ways students can find a way to start paying off their loan while looking for a job in their field such as working in a low level job.

A plan that could help build jobs for new grad students would including the government giving grants to buisnesses and tax cuts for providing jobs for newly graduate students. The job position wouldnt have to necessarily be the position the grad student wants but a start up place with opportunity of advancement. Another plan that can be created is to put off students loans until the grad student finds a job with the income that can pay off the loans a little by little.

There has been talk about a plan that the president wants to put into action regarding student loans. That plan includes that student loan payment should be decreases from 15% to 10% of their income and that if a students pays off their loan at a percentage every month, in 20 years if the loan isnt completely paid off, the loan will be overlooked. I think this is a great plan becasue it can give some future graduating student peace of mind that they wouldnt be drowned in debt for the rest of their lives. Although i believe that students should start paying off their loans at least 6 months after graduation and it should be paid off by 10 years, if that isnt a factor for everyone there is a back up plan.

The fact that it is so difficult for college graduates to find jobs is devastating. As a college student, the thought of not being able to work after I get my degree is a scary one. This is why it is essential that the government creates a program that makes it possible for college students to be employed right out of college and start paying off student loans.

To begin with, graduates should not begin paying student loans until a year after working in a secure, well paying job. Also, these payments should be in a monthly bill similar to an electricity or a phone bill. The amount they pay each month should depend primarily on their salary. The big question is, where will these jobs come from? One solution is, the government could start requiring earlier retirement from the elderly people. For example if someone has been working as a psychologist for thirty years, they should be forced into retirement as they make room for someone in more need of employment.

It is understandable that some people want to continue working because they enjoy what they do or they would like to continue making profit; however, they must realize that the younger generation is eager to share their more modern knowledge as well. The younger generation is more technology advance as we are able to complete task at a faster pace than the elderly. Furthermore, there are many ways for the elderly people to continue doing what they enjoy: writing books, creating websites, mentoring the young, etc.

In all, having the elder people retire early will create more jobs for upcoming college graduates.

Debt for recent college graduates is at an all time high. The average debt for a student is around $25,000. Now a days many students are also parents, with low paying jobs, balancing not only their family but their budget. When student debt out ranks credit debt, it obvious there is something wrong for our school systems. One problem that I find is that our finical aid system is very bias and only helps out a very small percentage of students. Universities make that even harder by not taking finical aid in certain courses or all together. The fact that everything is inflating, is a sure sign that finical aid needs to raise the income requirement. You may make a decent amout of money but the way things are now, people are still scrapping by making 40 to 50 thousand a year. Financial aid need to look at all aspects of the students life, and make decisions based on debt, homeownership, transportation, dependents etc.. Financial aid reform may not fix all the problems, but it can be a cushion to keep debt low.

One idea I had is that any graduate that chooses a high pay high debt career should be offered more help then most. Professional companies or government should set up a graduate job plan, something on the lines of affirmative action. Large high cash yielding businesses should hire a new percentage of graduates per year. So a lawyers offices that generates more then a million dollars a year, should hire five to six graduates per year for a certain time frame. They can pay the graduate a reduce number based on no experience. After say like six months the program would be over for the individual, and it&apos;s a win win situation. The graduate would get six months of experience, and the law office has a steady demand of cheap labor. If the office decides to keep the graduate it&apos;s an even better deal. They will also weed out the weak, and the student can finally decide if this profession is for them. The company can still fire the graduate if their performance was not up to par, Then student would have to finish of the remainder of their program at another office. If they get fired from there to, it is obvious they&apos;re in the wrong profession, and would show on their profession progress report. Either way they make some money, and get experience, which makes it much easier to find a new job. Those who are really good would be offered a permanent position.

My last suggestion should be that the government or cities could open a special graduate assistance offices. They would only help recent college grads find jobs in their field, or any place that was hiring. This would be in conjunction with official pay back dates being pushed to three years. This would give the graduate an ample amount of time to find some steady income. This would help people who are not working themselves, because they could work at these centers. The former students will get much needed support to find jobs. As a manager myself I would love to only hire college students. If I had the option of contacting a referral office, for qualified college graduates my choice would be easy in hiring people, and I think most people who hire will agree. Businesses would actively search for employees vs employees desperately looking for a job. There are jobs out there finding open good positions is the hard part. I feel that a combination of all three things would definitely improve the job market for all. This would create job reassurance, making more people go to school because there chances of finding a job are increased. It would also force Americans to achieve higher education, also making America the most educated country in the world.

The intended purpose of student loans has always been to give the graduate enough time to find a good job in the field that they are trained for in the first place. They should not be forced to take the first job that comes along just so they can pay back their student loan. I believe the time period should be at least two years before beginning to pay it back. This allows time for the student to get temporary employment, find aplace to live, and look at all options before making a decision that could be somewhat permanent. There should be serious job placement programs available for students after graduation employed by students trained in that field of job placement. There could be a small percentage of 1st years salary charged at the end of the year as a finders fee to support the program on top of any funding that could be provided to stop this dilemma.

There are new jobs being created. It&apos;s up to the students to research what new and old areas that have a demand for properly educated employees. It used to be good enough to have a Bachelor of Arts to acquire an entry level position, but times have changed. Students must be made aware of this predicament.

With tuition costs on the rise and jobs difficult to acquire, the government could implement a program in which graduates of fields that are in demand would be guaranteed a job. In return, the graduates would repay student loans based upon income and loan amount in a specific time period.

Corporations could be given incentives for hiring these graduates. If the graduates fail to be able to fulfill these jobs properly, then their programs could be forfeited. This is not easy as it would take cooperation in our political, educational, and corporate institutions; if we are to regain our standing as a world-leading nation, something radical must be done.

This is an appropriate and important topic that pertains to every college student. It is amazing how debts are at an all time high right now for college grauates. Unfortunately, not only do students have to worry about finding a job after college but also paying back their loans. It doesn&apos;t seem that there are many actions being taken to solve this problem.

A way that could help with this situation would be for jobs to open near college campuses for students only to help them pay their loans and tuition. It would attract more customers and help open up more jobs. It would be beneficial for everyone. Another idea would be for the government to start up a program at college campuses to help students pay their debts. This can be accomplished by allowing those who don&apos;t have a job to do work for the college or around it to take off that debt. There can be different choices with that program.

Those ideas would help with the problem of college graduates struggling to pay off their debts. I feel that they should try to pay off the loan quickly as it is their responsibility, depending if they have a job or how much they work. If not, they should try to get into the program stated above or the job
so that they could attempt to pay. Then money gets put back in the bank and jobs can be opened up to help pay the loans. The solution for one problem helps the other problems be solved.

In my opinion, students should apply to small businesses such as restaurants and retail, and only then should they begin sending in resumes to businesses of their major. Why? Because some students are so set on making money and think life is so easy that they only apply to the major businesses that they want to go to. Let&apos;s all face it, life isn&apos;t easy and sometimes it takes a period of time to get what you want. Sometimes you have to go through hell to get heaven. This way graduates can still continue to make money while sending in resumes at the same time. There should be many businesses around college campuses so that after graduation, the student doesn&apos;t need to move at times and can continue working.

I believe that students should get to have a choice when they get to begin paying back, not many years, but when they are comfortable. But the longer the student takes, the more profit the loan company receives. Just like a credit card payment, you don&apos;t want to wait forever, but if you don&apos;t have the money then pay what you can knowing it will be more in the long run.

As for how the payments go. Think of it as a car payment: For 60 months you can pay $350 at 1.9% interest. Or for 72 months you can pay $275 at 4.5% interest (don&apos;t begin doing the math, I just threw numbers on here to make a point.) If you pay more to these loans, they will trust that you have the money and won&apos;t screw them over, leading to a lower interest percentage and you not having to pay as much. But if you don&apos;t pay as much, the opposite pretty much occurs. This all leads up to the first paragraph stating that graduates shouldn&apos;t always just stick to applying to their major businesses, but find a smaller place to work at and then begin sending in resumes. It will be better for the individual in the long run.

I think that most of the problems we have in our society are because there are too many of us and there are very little amounts of resources. In order to create jobs I think that old people that have been working for a long time should retire and allow the new young graduates to take their place.

I think the government should make a plan that can work at a fast rate to get these graduates jobs. Maybe a plan were students can work their way up to a good loan from the governments and that way the can start their own businesses. But is going to be hard if they have to pay their loans.

Students should start paying their loans as soon as they have some money saved. Students should be given a chance to work, save some money (or not) and maybe after a couple of months when they are stable they can start paying back their loans. They can start paying their loans by getting ten percent out of their check and they should do this for as long as it takes until the loan is paid off, unless they pay really high taxes.

The intended purpose of student loans haas always been to provide a different type of loan which will make it easier or at least possible, to have enough time to look for suitable and hopefully long term employment. If the student is forced to take the first job that comes along in order to start paying back the loan, it defeats the whole purpose.

I believe the time period should be at least two years before having to start paying on the loan. This allows a student time to get tempoary employment, find a place to live, and look at all options before making a decision that could be somewhat permanent.

The stigma of having a student loan to pay off has deterred many intelligent people from going to college. These potential students could be making more money at higher paying jobs and adding to the economy. Job placement after college is an important factor which seems to be lacking enormously. We should give students jobs as career placement specialists to assist other students in finding jobs in their field. A small percentage of salary after one year could be charged as a finders fee to help keep the business going, along with any funding that could be provided. More success means more jobs, which means more money for more programs, in order to solve this dilemma.

Firstly, the facts given in the blog topic are remarkable yet saddening. People spend the first 25 years of their lives chasing a diploma and then a degree in hopes of finding a job that in their field that they enjoy. The sad truth is that a college degree does not necessarily mean that you will find the job of your dreams and you may be paying for loans without the dream job. My sister and a few friends of mine have already graduated from college only to find that can’t get work in their field just yet. My question is, if college is so expensive, why can’t finding a job that can help pay back your expenses be easier?
It makes you wonder if all the studying and years of school is really worth it. As far as job creation goes, I honestly do not know what they can do. In this country, it is about who you know, not what you know. Therefore, somebody with better connections may get a job over someone who is more qualified and I think the problem lies there. I suggest that college students should pay back their loans when they find the job or a related job in their field that they went to school for.
Until then, it is unfair to ask a college graduate who is working at a fast food restaurant to pay off his college loans when the degree obviously isn’t worth the investment. When they get their job in the field that they studied for in school or a job that pays well enough, I think that is the proper time to pay back the loans. All in all, college is an investment and if it doesn’t pay off, it shouldn’t leave people worst off.

Today&apos;s economy is in a bad condition; the devastating recession that the United States of America has faced, has made it difficult for young adults to get promising jobs. This is sometimes causes by the fact that the economy has dropped and new college graduates have to be paying off their student loans. Some also decide to continue their academic career.

I believe that in order for there to be more jobs available the government should assist every college student in getting the proper education they need to be qualified for the working world. If this strategy is applied the students will be able to go through college without all the stresses of getting a tertiary; making them ready for whatever difficulties that may arise.

After allowing students to complete college the government should allow them to gain a suitable amount of money; so they will be comfortable and secured when paying their loans back.

For a while now, the tuition for college students have risen tremendisly throughout the years, and are leaving college students penniless. I dont get why the amount of tuition is not following the amount of inflation, because now tuition is 600% above the limit. The whole reason people are going to college is to get a better education so they can obtain better jobs. Sometimes there are no jobs that are open right after students graduate, so they are left with this huge debt that they cant start paying off.


There should be jobs that are created so that graduates can start working in their feild right after they graduate. Then theis way they can start paying off their debt in no time. Also, by doing so they will have a better understanding of what their feild is consisted of and have more expierence.


We should create jobs that assist the workers in the feild that the graduate wants to enter. For exapmle, there could be a job to assist a pyschologist with helping their patient resolve a problem. The graduate would obtain much more knowledge because they are actually working with mentors in their field. As long as we get this problem of creating jobs so that graduate students can pay off debt as soon as possible, then the inflation wouldnt be a strain as much.

Instead of waiting for students to graduate from college, jobs should be created while students are still in college. Businesses and companies should be partnered with college students in their field of work. For example, investment firms or banks should have internship opportunities available to business majors at a local university. By the time that student graduates, they should have a secured job.


With this method, students are able to work while they are still in school and already able to start paying off that student loan. They shouldn&apos;t wait to graduate to start paying that off. The debt from student loans in this country is obviously too high. If students and local businesses take initiative while the students are still in school, they won&apos;t be thrown into the deep end when they enter the&quot;real world&quot;after they graduate.


Eventually, this method will become an on-going cycle. Alumni will start hiring students from the university they went to, and future students will be assured that if they go to college, they will have a job opportunity waiting for them at one of their local businesses,hospitals,schools, etc. The immediate working opportunity gives hem an immediate way to pay off their student loans. In 20 years, if the individual hasn&apos;t payed off their loan completely, then the rest of the amount should be forgiven.

It is the right time for people to go back to college, but it is also the most expensive, since prices are ridiculous! Nowadays it&apos;s less and less people that can actually afford college without relying on loans.

The problem with the student loans is that students sometimes get on several loans without proper information about forms of repayment and interest rate details; they just get the money. In my opinion students need to get any job while they are going to school, it does not matter if it&apos;s minimum wage, in order to keep the loans to a minimum.

A proposal for helping students to pay loans it&apos;s been on TV the last few days. Obama has proposed to decrease the maximum payment from 15% to 10% and he will also allow borrowers who have a loan from the Federal Family Education Loan Program and a direct loan from the government to consolidate them into one.

I believe that colleges need to help students to get internships in their junior or senior year. This will help them to set their&quot;noses&quot;into their field of study and might be able to get a job after graduation. Also,I think that they should be a program where if you do not find a job then you can work for example for the government as a form of payment of the loan. The student should start to pay the loan not 6 months after graduation, but when she/he gets a job! Specially in this times where it is harder and harder to get a job!
Regarding the time the student should be paying off the loan, would depend on the loan itself; Obama is saying 20 years, and I believe that is about right.

Jobs can be created after a college student graduates by opening more jobs around the campus as said above. ALso the school can open its doors to graduates by allowing them to work as assistants for teachers. They can gain experiance and have a better chance of acquiring a job outside the campus.

Also student should NOT be paying THAT much money for tuition, it is rediculous. Its as if the head people want of this country to be full of stupid people. Education gives everyone opportunities, but by making it impossible to pay education will be scarce, also the fact that teachers are getting pay cuts! its RIDICULOUS!

Finally, how and were do i suggest they can get jobs and pay off their loan? Start paying it off right after you are done with college/university and get a job around the campus and save to pay it off.. sadly.

To begin I believe that tuition in the United States is completely outrageous. Most students are just coming out of high school and would like to increase their education to full fill a career of their choice. College students do not have careers they are just starting their life out. In order to attend college without financial assistance from your parent’s one must take out massive student loans in order to maintain their education.
I believe the best way to increase jobs would be to provide students with a program that is designed for them to go into their industry directly after college. I also believe that student should only be responsible to pay back their loans after two years of this program being offered. It takes someone after college to gain the experience that is needed to increase their salary.
Therefore allowing students a two year grace period after schooling with a program that allows them to have a job would be sufficient enough time for graduates to stay out of debit. I also believe students shouldn’t be paying more than 5- 8% back not 10 percent or each pay check which is the amount you would currently have to pay.

The only way for there to be job growth in the current is through government spending. Private business long ago forfeited any responsibility to the public welfare. The government should nationalize more industries and regulate rates of employment so that no member of society should have to fail because of a lack of opportunity to work. Additionally the federal government should invest in industries that will see growth in the future so that the American worker can stay relevant in the future.

Graduates should try and pay back their student loans as soon as possible, otherwise it will hang above their head the rest of their lives like the sword of Damocles, accruing interest. Even if other priorities have to be put on hold, debts should be paid as soon as possible. If left alone, debts will only fester.

How student debts should be paid is another issue entirely. In my opinion, student debt should be subsidized by the federal government. Key to the American dream (work hard and succeed) is the implicit assumption that we all start on the same level; this is self-evidently false. Sliding scale subsidized loans by the federal government based on economic need would make it so more people would have access to a college education and allow them to achieve their goals and become beneficial members of society.

Graduating college is supposed to be the official start of your adult life, you are expected to go out into the world with a degree in something that will be sufficient enough for you to live off of. And in past decades this was the case, many people who graduated college found jobs and made good money, enough to support a family. Even people who didn&apos;t graduate from college could find a job! Back in the day it wasn&apos;t even necessary to have a degree in something to make a decent salary. But in todays day and age with the economy the way it is, people find that it is increasingly more difficult to find a job, let alone one that even pertains to what you&apos;re qualified for. So this sends people back to school, with the idea that if they earn a degree or get a second one, that they will be able to find a job. So, now, you have all of these people with no jobs who are going back to school to earn a degree that they probably won&apos;t even get to use due to the fact that everyone else is also getting that same one.

The cost of a college education is ridiculously high and with everyone going back to school that means a lot of people are going into debt and taking out a heavy sum of loans from the banks. The typical loan is allowed to start being paid off 6 months after a student has graduated from college, but those 6 months flash by when you&apos;re starting your life, trying to find a job that falls under your degree. The banks should extend the amount of time from when you graduate and when you can start paying off your debt. This would allow for the student to concentrate on finding a solid, stable job and earn and save money so that they can get on their feet and start paying back to their loans.

For the question as to how to create jobs for job-seeking graduates, the most logical, thought about answer is to bring back jobs that have been taken from other countries. Why outsource what we have here? Sure, its cheaper for the bigger corporations but in the long run they are only hurting themselves, with more people with less money to be able to keep their businesses running. The government should step in and make it a law that outsourcing should be limited to what is only necessary, thus, leaving ample jobs available to those in our own country who need them. Thats just one way to do it, another would be to start while the students are still in college. Have companies partner with schools to take the incoming field workers under their wings and show them the ropes while also getting paid. A study program with benefits. With all of the schools out there and all of the big businesses looking for cheaper labor this works in favor of both parties.

It is very sad that today in 2011 students are being in a way punished to go to college. We pay thousands of dollars to go to school to try and better ourselves and receive an education that will further us in life. Many students have to take out loans for this amount of money and it will take forever to pay back in the end after they have completed there degree. We need to come up with a better system in which students can pay faster and easier and get a job faster after graduation.

I believe that jobs should be created around the school campuses, such as restaurants and book stores and small business&apos;where the local students can start earning more money to better prepare for after college lifestyles. If the jobs are created before it will help be able to pay off the loans faster and at a cheaper rate.

Also I think that if the students began to pay while in college and not have such a high interest rate while paying it will make paying for college easier. The jobs should be built around for these students now so that they can learn to have a good work ethic which would make getting a real job after graduation easier and create experience. When creating these extra jobs it will make it better for the economy and the students because each will be making money and creating more jobs for the country.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

It is ridiculous to think that in todays world the average college student has to start their adult lives with so much debt, it hinders young adults before they even get started. To think that a new married couple will have to start with 50,000 dollars in debt is way too much. Personally I have not taken any loans out but to think the person I marry will already have debt attatched to them somewhat scares me. Lastly, to know our country has reached one trillion dollars is student loans is also a scary thought. This country has so much debt as it is to think that this huge deficit is continuing to grow is not a good thing.

Jobs need to be created for college students to have accessible to the room after they graduate, too many students graduate and then struggle to finds job and this is the majority of the problem. How can one pay for a debt if they themselves are not making any money? Its a hard question to answer, I feel that the country needs to create a surplus of jobs whether it be through the colinization of untouched land or changing our countries policies on workers now. Jobs can only be filled if there is an opening the problem in todays society is that there are no jobs for graduates to recieve. Students should also look into fields with more job openings, personally I am planning on being a teacher and this career choice leaves me a wide variety of options as I progress to the future. There are always going to be need for teahchers, doctors, nurses, businesses, and so on.

I feel that students should not have to ppay their students loans back until they are making a certain amount of money. When student loans are forced on a graduate as soon as they graduate it only makes their situation tougher. Each situation is obviously different from the amount of money you owe and the amount youre going to make in your profession but if there was a certain percent taken out every year and put towards your student loans it would slowly diminsh. Also for people on salary maybe having a portion taken out every paycheck that goes automatically to student loans no matter how much it may be. College loans can not sit around forever though or they will build up, after one hits the&quot;percentage&quot;they should have 5 to 10 years depending on the agreement they have with their loan company. There is no certain or perfect way to fix the problem with student loans but there are ways to prevent this deficit from growing into an even bigger epidemic than it already is.

I already knew that college tuition has been going up and still continues to increase as the years go by but I did not know it was up to 600%. Reading those facts has given me quite a scare and it makes me think twice before doing anything myself. But all this could be prevented before jumping into college by doing well in high school, dual enrolling, going to a two-year community college first and living at home, watching what you spend, work part-time, and/or applying for scholarships. Most people don’t plan it out and just dive in and end up being on of those percentages above.

It takes 2-10 years or more depending on what degree you are pursuing and costs a lot of money to attend school. Imagine putting all this time and effort to finish school and then find out that there are no jobs out there for you. Jobs need to be created by the government for graduate to be able to work in their field and pay back all their loans. We need more small businesses out there to more hire people to keep them from being unemployed. Maybe even have large companies hire graduates or allow them to be interns and then see how it goes from there. Colleges should help college students decide on what jobs are on demand and other statistics to prevent this from happening.

Graduates should start paying their loans as soon as possible to get it out of the way and keep it fro increasing. The best loan for a student to get is a subsidized loan because you begin to pay your first payment six months after you graduate and interests start that first payment as well. If a student works part-time while they’re in school then they will have some money to pay off their first loan payment, if they saved up that is. If not then start searching for a job as soon as possible.

How does the government expect us to succeed in life when their so much road blocks in front of us?! Just from reading all the facts from this blog i feel that the government is setting up college students for failure because we go to college to prepare ourselves for the“job”that we are suppose to get after years of intense studies.

On way jobs can be created for college students once they graduate is by the universities or colleges giving them a job. The schools takes a lot of money from the students, one thing the school can do with all that money they make in profit is find the college students a job in their career field. This would really take a lot of stress of the students because students worry about what they are going to do after they graduate because in today’s economy it is very hard to find a job.

I suggest the best way students pay of there loans is they are given a job from where they studied. Second their load should be taken off there salary. From every pay check ten percent should go directly go toward the load. There should not be time length because everyone will does not make the same amount of money. Another way to pay of the loans is make tuition cheap so students do not have to struggle paying mortgage, insurance and loans off.

According to the statistics it pretty much saying that most college students are broke and unemployed by the time they graduate. The way we could elemanite this is by creating more jobs for when college students graduate. Jobs can be created by giving and students obtaing internships. If they show themselves capable of what ever them are doing then i think they should get hired.

The time given to a student to pay back their loans is reasonable to a certian extent. The certian extent is that it might take a student longer in this economy to find a job. I personally think that if they made the grace period for loans any longer it would make the government go into more debt, becasue their are more and more peolpe taking out loans. The grace period is six months, but i think they should give them at least six to ten months to begin to pay their loan back.

I think the way students already pay back their student loans is okay. Again if the government or banks allowed more time people will take advantage and not pay or make late payments. The length of time to pay back your loan should be condensed, meaning that some students should pay what they can give. Again they dont have a job so how are they supposed to pay the amount assigned to them? I really think that the cost of school should go down and then the statistics would drop a whole lot than what they are.

College tuition has increased and will keep increasing, but the true topic is more than college tuition increase. The question that should be asked now is,“Is College going to make a difference?”In the past if this question were asked, the answer would undoubtedly be, absolutely, but now times have changed, along with our economy. Tuition has increased, along with student loans, but jobs and careers are steadily decreasing.

It is almost safer to say not to go to college. With the rates being so high for college, and student loans excelling from previous years, the only thing being gained from college is a high student loan payment that you cannot afford because there are not any jobs hiring for someone with your educational background. However, we have put in the time and effort to not let anyone tell us that we do not deserve an opportunity.

I think that with our economy being at a slow increase of workforce, it may be our job to find a way for us to gain opportunities. I think one to create jobs would be by informing students of areas that need work. Allowing students to pay thousands of dollars in a field that has no work is unnecessary. Instead of allowing only 25 students to enter the medical field, open the number up and allow 75 students. This will create more jobs at the school and allow students a better chance of a career start.

In order to pay back student loans, we need to have jobs. I think part of the idea of a student loan should be that once we are out of school, we have eighteen months to find a career. Once we have found a career, we have to start paying back student loans. The way our economy is right now, it is difficult to just find a job. I think how much you would have to pay should also be based on your income level. This proof could be provided by pay stubs or letter from your supervisor. With all of the issues in our economy, I think it is best that we look at this issue as a whole. New rules and standards need to be created to help our country grow and benefit from our education system.

Increased college tuition has become a problem for just about every college student. It seems really unfair that you must pay so much to receive an education and to be able to achieve a career. We all want to better ourselves and we think that going to college and receiving a higher education in the key to success. And it is! But with high college tuition, loads of student loan debts, and no jobs that pay enough to repay the loans, College Graduates find themselves between two walls.

Most college students now are fresh out of high school which means that they do not have money to be paying for such high tuition rates. Then when they graduate and try to find jobs, they can&apos;t. So I think that: One: tuition rates shouldn&apos;t be so high. And two: re-paying the loans should be easier. Three: New jobs should be created to fascilitate loan repayments and the quality of life of College Graduates.

College tuition should be lowered because they are way too high, period. Loan re-payment should be easier, by lowering the interest rates for these loans. And, college students should really begin to pay them as soon as they can. Even if its just a little every month, they should try and eliminate the debt faster by re-paying what they can as soon as they can. Even if they have not graduated yet. Finally, and most importantly, new jobs should be created. How? Simple. The government should step in and realize that the economy will not arise if they do not begin to create new jobs for the college graduates and everybody really. They need to do the research and figure out where it is that the government needs to invest the money. Not in things that are just making the economy worse.

The way we could create jobs for students after graduation would be for all schools to implement a networking system with future employers. My sister went to Northwood a private college that helps all students to set up internships and or jobs after graduation. Most colleges do not have these programs, two weeks out of college my sister had a payed internship with the Detroit lions football team in there marketing program. Even after the internship her college helped her find further employment. Northwood is a very expensive private University, these types of programs need to be implemented at all schools even community colleges so we all have equal opportunities. This would be one way to help ensure employment after college

Now when it comes to college loans I think that there needs to be more information about how the loans work the different options interest rates etc. A lot of young people are taking out large loans with out realizing the finical burden they are creating for there future. I also believe in working while going to school so that your student loan money does not become food money or rent money. I know many young people who have taken out loans for more then they needed so they could use the money for luxury items and figured they would worry about it later. I do not think there is enough information out there on student loans or scholarship.

If you do have to take out a student loan I believe you should have to pay it back once you have a job after college. I also think you should be able to choose how much you pay as long as you have some time of financial plan set up in which to pay it.

More jobs could be created for newly graduated college students if businesses would be more open-minded in hiring fresh out-of-college graduates. A lot of businesses shy away from hiring them because they view them as not as experienced as other candidates. I tend to think that it would be better for companies to hire these&quot;fresh out-of-college&quot;graduates because their minds are more active and vibrant than the&quot;old hag&quot;who has been working for the company for 40 years. This means new and fresh ideas for your company.

The more people that are put through college means more than likely that those people will one day create more jobs for the soon-to-come graduates as well. If colleges and the government made it easier for funds to become avaliable for students to be able to attend school, then more people would graduate meaning more jobs in the future. So it&apos;s almost like a snow-balling effect.

I think that the system we have now for students to pay back their loans when they have fully completed school is good, but perhaps extending that time to at least 5 years after will give the student more time to be able to find a good job and to be able to pay back the loan in full. It is highly difficult to find the perfect, great paying job right after you graduate and then start paying of your loans immediately.

I think that the way to go about creating jobs is for more companies to hire out of college students. Perhaps the government could give companies an incentive for hiring people who are freshly out of school. The school system could also work with companies to provide paid internships to help prepare more college students transition into there career field. With more companies getting college students into paid internships, and the government giving incentives to companies for making these programs more jobs could become available.

I think hiring more college students would be beneficial to more companies because college students are more inclined to try and diversify a companies policies as well as trying to create a more updated work place. I think that companies who hire a wider range of employees, and especially employees of w wider age range would have a better chance at making more profitable sales.

I would say that college students who are in debt and have a job should try to pay back as much of there loans as soon as possible, try to be as fiscally responsible. The faster you can pay back your loans the less you&apos;d have in interest, and the less likely you are to default and end up with bad credit. And since credit pretty much runs the country at this point it would be a wise idea to try and gather up as much positive credit as possible.

The days when college was only accessible to the rich are over. Nowadays with the help of Goverment grants and the students loans , almost everyone can get a college education. A lot of pressure has been put on students to attend college in order to find a good job. But the reality is the more college graduates means more competition for the limited number of jobs available.


The main reason why a college graduate can&apos;t find a job is because most of the possitions offered requires work experience. A degree alone won&apos;t qualify us for a job. But how can we get experience if no one hires us ?. One solution can be intern for free at a company you would like to work in the future, while you are there try to acquire as much skills as you can. If after some time that company don&apos;t hire you then apply for a similar job and use the intership as your work experience. Creating a good impression on your internship may get you a good recomendation.

I do agree that the price of tuition is really high, I don&apos;t think those prices are fair especially in this moments of crisis that we americans are going trough. I think everyone should be eligible to recibe a grant from the goverment. I also believe that Banks should reduce the interests on the students loans and start paying them back 6 months after we get a job , not 6 months after we graduate.

The fact that so many students fresh out of college are not only in huge debt but also jobless is a very sad thing to see. A student works so hard on a degree just to have nothing to show for it. The college could help in tremendous ways. They could provide many internships for them so when they do graduate they have some experience in the field.

Also the colleges could come up with a deal with the local companies for the class to also be helping them. For example in Johnson and Whales University they cater and plan huge evens for companies and only charge the companies the expenses to do everything. So when they do graduate they can put down that they worked for this company through the school.

One huge thing that would help the graduates is if the banks would not only give them more time to pay the loan back but to also make the payments manageable. For example not make them pay until they get a job. Then look in to what they make and come up with a monthly payments manageable so they could live on there own and pay it back.

Today we have reached an all time high for student loans and supprisingly its passed credit card debt. this is a problem for todays youth still in school. there should be an opening for new jobs.

creating more jobs with local coorporations affiliated with the schools should have openings for all students to work off their debts.Universities that are sponsored by local restaraunts , big time store jobs should be created. people that are over a certain age should be asked to step down and retire to give the youth a shot.

i also believe that the fixed rate should&apos;nt be so high for a graduate to have to pay back.maybe the banks lending out the money would get their money back way quicker if the payback rates were a lot lower

Jobs can be easily created by making programs to help students that just graduate find a job, whether it be interning for a company or even working full time based on the grades of the student. Having a college owned company that specializes in a particular field also is an ideal way to hire graduate students. It gives them the opportunity to earn money and start paying off their debts.

I believe that when a student has found a steady job they should begin repaying their student loans. The student themselves has a certain year period from when they get the job to decide when to start paying back their debts. If a student has to repay their loans as soon as they get a job they might not be satisfied with that particular job and might decide to quit. As a result will have no income and still be stuck with debts.

A student, when they decide to repay debts, should pay the debts back by a portion of it coming out of their paychecks. Just like how taxes automatically come out of you check and additional and reasonable amount should be taken off your income so the student doesn’t have to worry about it. I feel that doing it that way will create less hassle and a overall better outlook on student loans and when to pay them back.

When a student graduates college they usually don’t have a job waiting for them but do have loans waiting to be paid. Unfortunately if the college graduate doesn’t have a job how are they supposed to start paying back the loans. Now days a college degree doesn’t just get you a job in the field you would like. Most college graduates end up working jobs that high school students work making an hourly wage, they also end up moving back in with their parents because they are in so much debt with no job that they can’t afford to pay back they loans. There has got to be a way to create more jobs for students.
One way to create more jobs for college graduates would be for companies to higher people with a college degree. Most businesses and companies have a decent amount of employees who don’t have a college degree so what’s the solution, increase the number of well-educated workers in our workforce. Another way to create more jobs for college graduates would be for business and companies to create some entry level jobs that seek college graduates. It would benefit both the company and the graduate because the graduate could get a job in the desired field and the company will not have to pay as much for the position. I know it doesn’t sound right but you can’t except to graduate college and immediate be making 100K but you can work your way up if you start out making 25K.
College graduates need to start paying off the loans immediately; although this may seem hard to do it will benefit them in the long run. One way to begin paying off the loans is to take a look at you monthly income and then take a look at your monthly bills, including student loan payment. Then then need to set up a budget to see how much they append and how much they need for expenses and how much they need for daily living. After dong this they should cut down on unnecessary spending and pay off loans with the highest interest first because this could be a waste of money if they wait too long.

When a student graduates college it is least likely for them to have a job but if students focus on paying their loans back first then everything wont seem rushed and will fall into place.
Jobs can be created after students graduate college by allowing students with a college degree to be able to have a full paid job instead of interning and earning no value for their assistance.
I strongly feel that if students don&apos;t pay their loans back they should not be able to work until do so! There is no reason why you should not be able to pay off your debt. If you can&apos;t pay back the money you borrowed then you should not rush into trying to find a job you should focus on the impotant things which is clearing your name out of the system so it wont effect you and your credit in the future.
Loans should be paid in a time spand of the person dealing with their situation. The only thing that should matter is the debt you are in and trying to find a solution to your problem so that if you do luck up and find a job your name is clear and your credit score is extremly high!!!

It is a shame that students start off their career in a heap of debt and with few job oportunities. Going to college is supposed to be a way to brighten your future, not condemn it to a life in debt.

I believe that there are ways for jobs to be created. I think that jobs would be created if the U.S. would turn its focus on fossil fuels to new, cleaner, sources of energy. If we could develop these new technologies I believe it would open up a whole new feild of careers and jobs. Most of these jobs would be skilled positions and thus require people with college degrees to perform them.

I feel like people with college loans should not have to pay them back as soon as they graduated college. I think that they should be able to wait until a year after they get a job, depending on there salary, before they are required to start paying them back. This is just so they can get settled into a place to live and sort of figure out thier budget. I also believe that students should have a fair amount of time to pay there loans back. I believe that income and expenses should be taken into account when determining the time period that college graduates should be allotted to pay back thier loans.

Debt is inevitable when it comes to college. unless a student puts all their effort into school maybe scholarships are an option but for those of us who must work in order to live, loans are the only option. There is truly no solution to lowering the cost of tuition, with the economy in shambles students are flocking to the college scene because an education is the only way to go, but at what cost.
There is a limit on jobs at this time and finding one out of school is near to impossible. in my opinion tech jobs are the most secure. A nursing major can graduate and find a job fresh out of school, but that does not go for a business major. It is very common for students to struggle finding a job so much that they are forced to move in with their parents. How can we be expected to pay back a 50,000 dollar loan when we cannot even afford to support ourselves.
The only solution to this problem is lowering the rate at which students must pay back loans. Also giving them a cushion of one full year out of college to start paying them back. some of us will get lucky and find our dream job but that is a low 10 percent if that, the rest of us will be stuck with our parents with no job or security no health plans nothing just a fat sticking pile of debt.

The monetary system in this country has yet again found another way to wrap it&apos;s greedy hands around consumers and take them for ransom. Only this time the targeted age group is much younger, and much less experienced. It&apos;s absurd how high the cost of tuition has risen in the past 20 years. And the fact that most graduates move back home with their parents just goes to show how much a failure our great nation has become. College graduates should be on the front lines of this economy, obtaining good paying jobs straight out of school. The sad reality is that most of them move back to their home town and pick up a job at the local Barnes and Noble. This has got to stop.

The first thing our country needs to do is lower the cost of tuition to ensure these students don&apos;t dig themselves into a ridiculous amount of debt from the get go. Secondly, we must stop outsourcing jobs to places like India. I understand that it is much cheaper to do so, but we have to look into the future. If things keep up the way they are going, we are in for a world of trouble.

With these two changes it would be much easier for students straight out of college to get jobs and pay back their loans because a job would be easier to come by and the debt to pay back would be less. Also, the time to pay a loan back should be restructured. Instead of having to pay back the student loans 6 months after graduation, it should be changed to 6 months after getting a job.

Most students attend school for at least four years, in hopes of becoming a professional in the field of their choosing. During that time, a large debt, that most won&apos;t be able to pay back is created. Between books, supplies, classes, labs and so on that debt can easily sky rocket. It is very hard to find a job, even with four plus years of education, without any real field experience in that profession. Most students end up taking a lower paying job for a short to long term to build their experience, only to compete once again for a spot that they deserve but may be over looked because they may be over qualified.



Though students are allowed to intern for corporations of their professional choosing, students should also be allowed to compete for real paying jobs in that area at least two years prior to graduating, giving them at least two years of experience in that field. In doing so, students would be able to leave school, obtain a experienced/graduate level position, instead of the normal entry level, giving them the financial option of paying back their student loans faster without being in anymore debt.



Student should have the option to pay back their loans on an individualized level, after they have held a job for at least six months, and a job that provides enough of an income to pay other life expenses- mortgages, family, insurance, groceries, in addition to their student loans. Some professions require more in depth schooling and education, but may not have the same availability of open positions as another job that didn&apos;t require as much, so why are they expected to pay back their debt at the same rate? I believe, if students had the option to work the government o their loans, the drop out rates wouldn&apos;t be so high, more people would return to school and most would go above the degree they initially started school for.

Understandably having little no jobs once a student graduates college is a huge concern today for students in the United States. To be honest it is hard to say how we can create jobs after students graduate. Most students do not want to be working at a grocery store or coffee shop after graduating college. But now days that is exactly what has happened. Job opportunities are created because there is a need for that service or the goods that is being offered. So to create jobs we need economic growth.
Fortunately for me I have not and will not have to experience being in debt or paying loans back because my parents are paying for my education, but this is a huge concern for most of the college population. I think college graduates should start paying the loans back when they have the means necessary to do so. Meaning after they find a job that will allow them to and have the money to be able to do so. By doing this graduates will have to worry less about how to come up with the money and more on where to find a job, and how to get a good start to making an income for themselves.
I think students should get the opportunity to begin paying off their loans while there in college. We could make this happen by letting them work at certain places doing the school year that allows them to make some money to pay off their loans. Also I think scholarships should be available to every student that needs it. This would cause less debt as well. They should be allowed to be able to pay off their loans for twice as many years they are in school for, considering how expensive education is.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

A concept worthy of investigation is to encourage college graduates to work for the government in any field related to the degree. Not to say that they would be forced to work there forever, but if the government could guarantee entry level positions for college graduates, it would provide income to the students, a regularly rejuvenated crop of new employees, peak possible interest in a new, related field for former students, give by default as a latent function a better understanding of the system of which we are all apart, but few understand with clarity, and bring new ideas and strategies to an institution that is currently devoid of them.

This concept could be applied to each level of government as well, not solely the federal. In fact, more good would be done for the system on the whole if the graduates were encouraged to work for local institutions in order to promote interest in the community. Who is more likely than a local to see a cause through to the end? I believe that if more students&quot;gave something back&quot;to a community, system or institution after college, that they would care more about what is going on in the world aside from their personal lives, which is something that many forget to consider when voting or seeking degrees for a future career.

Student loans causes graduates to begin their post-college life beneath square one because of the debt incurred while attending school. I think that students should have as long as needed to pay back student loans. A limit should be set of course, perhaps 20 years. Some may think that sounds too long a time to pay back a loan, but the investment is in a person, who will be living for quite some time, ideally. Logically, 20 years makes more sense as a time limit than five or ten years. For the first several years after graduating in most cases, the income will not be abundant enough to pay back loans on top of typical monthly expenses. If you increase the time limit, you reduce the financial strain of repaying them. I do think, however, that loan holders should begin making payments on their loans within one year of finding employment. As long as money is flowing in to the loan, it is being repaid, even if it takes a while longer.

It’s incredible to see how much college tuition has raised this last couple of years and seems to keep on rising toward the future. Contributing to more students going to the work force after high school or thinking twice about getting a college degree without a scholarship or help from financial aid. Also to make things worse, after graduation students find it really difficult to get a job of the acquire profession and are most likely force to move back with their parents. All those factors make more and more students question if college was even worth the time and money, because most end up where they started and with a debt. Naturally is a position nobody would like to be in and doesn&apos;t have to be in, if the government puts some time in the predicament and comes up with some ideas that will help the students and the country in the long run, because the country depends on the youth.
One of these ideas would the creation of agencies, organization or programs that focus only on certain professions and work with colleges to assure a job to students after graduation. The best example of this idea on the real world would be the medical field; most medical graduates tend to get jobs after graduation because a lot college have programs that help the students find a job as soon as they get their degree. This dea is something that would really help out with those professional fields that are tough to finds jobs in and require more than a good education to get into, which in the real world are good connections. Also talking about who u know and not what you know, supporting the same idea, it would be a good investment for colleges to keep good relations with local business and companies. I say this because as the saying goes&quot;one hand washes the other&quot;, what would be an easier way for a college student to find a job after graduation, than if it was given a job by a local business or company that has ties to the college, almost like a family thing.
Second, I believe graduate students should start paying for their education debt four years after their graduation. Even if it sounds like a long period of time, it&apos;s really not because the first two years is for students to get back on their feet and the other two years would be for buying essential things such as a house and a car and the money after that would be surplus wealth, which would be the most favorable money for students to payout out their debt. Also this long period of time would give students enough time to work on their profession and accumulate an enough salary to pay debt and still have money to live comfortably and realize college was worth the time and money. Last, I believe students should pay their college tuition debt to the max and even a little more. I believe on this because after a getting a college degree and working four years into a profession, money should not really be an issue anymore, and there will be more students in the future that will need the money, and we can&apos;t depend the government to pay everything, that&apos;s why the country is in such a high debt that only keeps going up and up, and I believe its up to the students, the future generation to change that by giving back to the country, after the country already gave to them.

The daunting reality of debt after college plagues a majority of students. Unless a student fits into the narrow guidelines established for receiving financial aid, they are most likely going to have to take out a loan or grant of some sort. This route is undesirable for most due to the lack of jobs and/or positions directly related to a student’s major.

While creating more jobs to ensure employment for college graduates may not be an option, especially in the current economic situation, a solution to the growing debt of college graduates may be to offer incentives for less desirable positions. There is currently a program for education majors that if they work in a certain school zone for two years, all college loans will be forgiven. The schools they have to work in are generally in poorer areas with low school ratings, but after two years they are permitted to work anywhere and no longer carry any debt. Both the school district and students benefit from this program. In other fields, there are positions and/or areas that a more experienced professional is unwilling to take, but a new college grad would be willing to work under the pretense that after a given amount of time, part or all of their existing school loans would be forgiven.

Changing how and when student loans are repaid would also be beneficial to the college graduate. Like when a new television is purchased and there is no interest for a year, the same principle should be applied to student loans. There should be no interest applied to loans until after one year of graduation. This allows the student time to enter the work force, become established, and possibly get ahead before having to start payment.

An option that would eliminate the need for student loans or decrease the dollar amount of them would be to reduce the cost of college tuition. As already stated, college tuition is up 600%. If this gross inflation were to be brought back to a more reasonable number, students either wouldn’t need a loan to cover tuition, or would be able to take out much smaller loans, thus allowing them to graduate with less debt and be able to pay back the loan in a more efficient manner. Also, if students entering the workforce have less debt, they will be able to buy more, thus stimulating the economy.

There is no easy solution to the debt of college graduates. In order to decrease the debt of college students, there are issues that need to be addressed on a federal, state, local, and personal level.

There is no guarantee that a student that graduated from college will be given the opportunity to be offered a job, a career is even more distant to achieve. However, there is hope. There are several different ways to attain a job that do not include the typical way of paying a tuition, studying, getting a certification, then finally, landing a job. For the motivated, there are several solutions to finding a job and starting a career such as applying in the Insurance Industry or any other Sales or Marketing Companies. It is highly recommended that you look into the product and the credibility of the company before applying. A similar approach to providing income would be becoming an entrepreneur. This approach of selling your own product is challenging by itself and again, only for the motivated, but if done correctly is much more profitable then waiting around for someone to call you back from an interview if you have even gotten that far.

Lastly, is entering in a trade such as Plumbing, Landscaping, Roofing, Cooking etc. Even though these trades require a certain amount of skill and study, they are relatively easy enough jobs that should have you receiving steady and sufficient income within 6 - 12 months, and from then on becoming a&quot;Foreman&quot;or&quot;Supervisor&quot;would typically be the next time frame which would require about 1 - 2 years to accomplish from the end of that time period. However be prepared to physically work hard or to work long hours in these Industries. It should be noted that in any Industry or trade that you are looking into be prepared to research not only the credibility of the company, but the life style of the Industry that you are interested in fits the life style you want to live, and if you have already decided to work in a Industry, or be self employed be sure to surround yourself with people who have worked in that area of work.

Student Loans should have already been planned into the budget of the student by the Parent/Legal Guardian or by the Student Him/her Self. If the Parent does not have the sufficient funds to send their child in into a College/University it is then up to the Student to find a way into a College/University by either a Scholarship or by working towards that by finding a job, if he/she has decided to further their education via a College/University. The student can also take the alternative route towards self - employment or small time contract work such as: cutting grass, Handyman work, or by being a minimum wage laborer to save for such expenditure. If the student has already fallen into debt because of college loans or expenditures, then using the same process will work as well, however, it will be much more difficult if the student is looking for a job (which is also another option) while balancing school work if the student is still in school. Time Management is the key to minimizing debt in the sense that the student needs to see what is the best solutions for him/her and then manage those options into his/her lifestyle. After this stage the Student should be able to see how long until the debt is paid off.

Students are graduating college today without being able to find a job. In newspapers and magazines, people can read articles about the best degrees to graduate with to find work in high paying jobs. A lot of students who graduate with degrees of those jobs find themselves in the dark and moving back home because they can’t find work. Most companies won’t hire the college graduates because training them to fit the position costs a lot of money and a lot of time to train them. I think with special tax pulled from tuition, jobs for college grads can be created and be a win-win situation for everyone.


Jobs can be created for graduate students from college if there was some sort of tax students paid every year they went to school. A very small percentage of what students pay for each class (something that’s hardly noticeable) would be added and given to companies and corporations of their major to use only when hiring college graduates. There are so many people going to school that it would all add up. What I mean by this is that a lot of times companies don’t hire students fresh out of school because of all the time and money it costs to catch the students up to where everyone else. Training college students is costly for companies and a lot of times prevents them from hiring graduates. If college students knew they were paying taxes that was given to companies for their training, students would hopefully be more motivated to graduate and stay in school as well.


As far as paying back student loans, college grads shouldn’t be required to start paying loans as soon as they graduate college. Loans should start to be paid back after graduates have held a stable job for at least a year or so, and loans shouldn’t necessarily have to be paid back immediately. Depending on how much the graduate is in debt (of school loans), a time span should be given as to how long they should have paid them back. Since jobs will be given to graduates of their major, which might allow them to jump into making salary (instead of the hourly wage of a mediocre job), students should be eligible to pay their loans back at a reasonable pace.

Being a college student in the process of finishing my AA and pursuing medical school following a degree in biology, it can be extremely frustrating and frightening when considering not only how long it will take me to finish but also the added pressures of being able to pay for my education when all is said and done. As the cost of tuition rises and the availiability of jobs post-graduation decrease, a couple hundred thousand dollars is not the kind of money you can take without a plan to pay it back. Realistically, I would even be able to begin covering student loans until after a 5 year residency and assuming I&apos;m 35 before that happens, I&apos;m looking at menopause or a midlife crisis before I&apos;m even earning the money I&apos;ve worked and been in school for, for 25 years. It&apos;s disheartening and it&apos;s most of all annoying to be constantly critisized for going to school. I can&apos;t tell you how many jokes or&quot;good luck with school, I hope it&apos;s worth it for you in the end&quot;&apos;s I endure on a daily basis.

The other day I went to Dunkin Donuts to study before an exam. I hadn&apos;t slept the night before and I needed to stay awake so of course a 24 hour establishment that sold coffee was the ideal place to be. A gentlemen in a construction hat in his mid-thirties approached me and asked what I was stuying for. Nothing he could process through his hard hat but I kept my comment to myself. He told me I was wasting my time and that&quot;ALL HIS FRIENDS&quot;graduated with degrees and can&apos;t find jobs. Am I really spending all my free time and money for an education that in the grand scheme of things will be worth the equivilent of a numbered ticket at the deli? It seems like graduating college with your degree is as common as putting gas in your car. It&apos;s like,&quot;oh, you went to Harvard? I went to publix earlier...&quot;

I don&apos;t necessarily know what we can do to increase the opportunity for new jobs but I do know that as long as there is no longer a need for professions that are being outsources by computers and technology the more dependent we become on a robot society that sadly, is becoming more efficient than humans. Steve Jobs built an empire and 100 years from now whose to say we&apos;ll still be using surgeons and not machine operatives? Or for crying out loud a computer controlling another computer until people are the minority and hovercrafts and iPeople have taken over the world.

All we can do is hope that Obama continues to lower the rate of dollars students are expected to give back annually on our loans and continue our degree with the assurance that we are needed in our communities, not because we floated through college and managed C&apos;s graduate but because we worked our butts off and are productive, determinded, hardworking, educated individuals of society.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

Jobs can be created for college students after they graduate from college by having a time period where older people retired and never return to work so job opportunities could be open to those just graduating college. Jobs can also be created by not having employees due so many duties that could be done by two instead of one. Although budgets are being cut in business by having one employee due several task, less employment opportunities are offered instead. The government should also create jobs for recent college graduates to help them gain experience so they could get a job at a faster time.

Students loans should be paid at the time period the college graduate gets a job. There shouldn&apos;t be a set time period when loans are to be paid back since there is not a time for a student to get a job. Getting a job for a college graduate could last from a day to a year. If a college graduate gets a job a day after graduating they can begin to start paying loans back and it will be paid faster. Although if a job is not obtain within a year and the time to pay it back is 6 months after graduating it will make the college graduate more in debt since they have no money to pay what it required to.

Students loans amount should be set up for an amount that the college graduate can pay back and not for an amount depending on the debt. Having a monthly amount set higher than what it can be afford will make the college graduate less likely to want to pay it. An amount and time period to pay loans back should be based on income to encourage college graduates to pay it not seeing themselves with much money left after making a loan payment. Loans should not accumulate interest since education will only make the United States more knowledgeable and more interest to attend school.

Employment rates for new college graduates have fallen sharply in the last two years, as have starting salaries for those who can find work. What’s more, only half of the jobs landed by these new graduates even require a college degree, reviving debates about whether higher education is“worth it”after all.

Young graduates who majored in education and teaching or engineering were most likely to find a job requiring a college degree, while area studies majors—those who majored in Latin American studies, for example—and humanities majors were least likely to do so. Among all recent education graduates, 71.1 percent were in jobs that required a college degree; of all area studies majors, the share was 44.7 percent.
For the first time, student loan debt has outpaced credit card debt in this country. And it&apos;s likely to top $1 trillion this year.

A student should make a list of how much they owe and in what time of period they can pay off their loans.With the standard option, you&apos;re going to pay a minimum of $50 per month, over the course of ten years. This will end up being the least expensive option. So if you can afford it, it&apos;s the best idea for you

I personally think the higher prices for a college education is outrageous. In our worst economic time the one thing most people need to do is go to college, and most take out loans in their own name. It has become nearly impossible to find a job at this time, which makes being a college student in debt much more difficult to deal with.

There will always be certain jobs that will be needed forever, such as doctors, police officers, etc. Most students base their majors off of what jobs are the highest paying and the most needed. I believe that if each student decides what they want to do with their lives by looking at what they will be most successful with will help some with the issue of not being able to find a job.

As for paying back the loans, there is a simple solution to that. Once the student is able to find any sort of job, they should have a certain amount of money they set aside each month to help pay off their debts. This will help the student pay for their debts throughout the years, without worrying about paying large amounts and not being able to pay for the other bills or every day necessities.

Over half of high school graduates think about going to a college or universities of their choice. But going to college after high school can be very expansive and the interest rates on those loans makes the loan even higher. The average college student is the second poorest person in the United States besides children. Graduating from a college and/or university is a huge deal and a great accomplishment. However when it comes to finding a job to help pay back those loans can be very difficult and stressful for anyone.
The way I believe that college students could pay back their loans for college tuitions would be to work at the school. Also they could help in anyway the could around the school like volunteering to do tours around the school or do parking detail for special events so it could go towards their tuition. Instead of the school hiring tutors the college grads could come back after they graduate when their free or for part time to help tutors those in need. Also the colleges and universities should create some type of fundraising program that the students could join to make money.
On the other hand, if the students still do not have enough money to pay back their loans after working for the school and tutoring then I believe they should not have to pay back the money until they found a job in their career field and then they should only pay a very small percentage every two weeks so their not stressing over paying their tuition fees. All in all joining the fundraising program and working for the school would lower the amount the student would have to payback at the end of their studies and it can make a huge difference. Society does not realize that college students are the future and many students choose not to go to college right after they graduate from high school because of the loans. If we make the necessary changes many students would work for the school to make money and lower their cost.

First of all education should be totally free, the goverment should pay for it, and not any kind of education, what we need is high quality education.

and about the loans, when the student graduates, he or she should have at least two dead years, where the debt is frozen, and about the interest of the loan should be very low or cero

because there is no sense if a student goes to college for 5 years and has to pays a loan for 15 years, and about the creation of jobs, there will always be demand for any kind of jobs, because the necesaty will always exist!

In my opinion the tuition for college is ridiculous. Compared to 20 years ago the tuition has increased substantially. Because getting an education is so important people are willing to pay the ridiculous prices. They take out loans to pay for their education. Before they even graduate they are deeply in debt.

Finding a job once they graduate can be harder than paying for their education. Although there will always be steady jobs like doctors and lawyers, most people cant afford the schooling necessary for those jobs. For those graduating with a 4 year degree there should be a placement program. This should be funded by the school and the government.

After finding a steady job is when you should start paying off your loans. Be sure to set aside a consistent amount every month. This will help you organize your money better and help you through a rough time.

It is extremely hard to get an education. Obtaining nice clothes, luxurious houses and expansive cars is now an impossible task. Having an education is now an expensive dream. One from we cannot wake from. As a student, I was personally held back at home at a community college for various reasons. First off, I could not attend my dream school with out having a huge loan at age 18. I could also not get away to my second choice due to the fact that I could not afford the dorms. To top it all off, I was a good student with a low income. I am also reconsidering my major into something that has a great job outlook for the future.

Jobs must be created. How else can we make our education worth it? Now and again, we have those useless degrees people earn and spend all their money on and it all turns out at the end that they can&apos;t find a job. Tuition must go down.

And then we have to of course, have government intervention as concerning the high interest rates on the loans. I think people should pay off their loans when they start making more money. Of course, the money never starts pouring in at the end of graduation. They need to extend the date for when people start paying their loan. It may hurt the banks though. Ultimately, tuition must go down. One way or another.

There are people that have graduated college ten or so years ago and they are still paying back student loans. Now that tuition has increased 600% since 1980, college graduates of this year and in the coming years will be paying back student loans for the rest of their lives. Not all college students had the opportunity to receive scholarships or financial aid. Some had to pay for school out of pocket. Some college students go away for school. 85% of college grads come back to live with their parents. One way to solve high tuition costs could be to attend a local college and spend a few more years at home. Students usually take the summers off to get a job and make some extra cash for the necessities such as gas, food, and car insurance.

With the costs of tuition increasing, more students are looking towards student loans. Not all students fit the criteria or meet the qualifications for grants and scholarships. There are a select few that get signed for a particular sport and get a full ride. However, not all college students play sports. Since most college students cannot pay for school out of pocket, the turn to loans. All college students should be able to qualify for scholarships and should have an equal chance. A graduate student usually starts out $25,000 in debt. If two college grads decide to tie the knot that amount doubles to $50,000 in debt. Those amounts may have students reconsider marriage for quite a few years. Getting married and having kids will just deepen the debt.

With our current economic situation, it is just as hard to find a job with or without a degree. Some people don&apos;t even go to college and are stuck with minimum wage jobs at McDonald&apos;s. Even some college graduates have to get a minimum wage job before they find a job in their career of choice. Although some student loan companies let students begin repayments six months after graduating there are still that make you begin as soon as you graduate. Students should be able to start paying back loans as soon as they get a job and have a steady money flow for about a month.

I think the institution that offer the four year degree should be in charge of job placement for it&apos;s students. Many of the school official should built great connections with business that are related to the degree that they offer. For example, nursing school should have great connections with local hospitals, so that way when the nursing students graduate atleast they will know somewhere to turn to. The school can also develop working abroad program for the student because just because there are no need for nursing student in America does not mean they don&apos;t need nursing student some where else. The students knows that one way or another they will have to pay their student loan. The bank or who ever is loaning them money need to keep in mind that after studying that finding a job is not going to be easy. I think that it will take the loaner, the school and the student in order to built more job.

I think tuition prices are way to high,our society advertise clearly getting an education is the way to go. Student will continue to go to school because that is the only way that they are asure they will make it in society. It is true that we need an education.

I think after the student get the loan to accomplish a four year degree, they should be giving 10 years to find a job before starting making payment. The should be allowed to decided how much of their payment they are going to make each month. They should be give a 15 years to finish paying their loans without any interest rate add. I also think that which ever company the end up working for should help them pay for their student loan. The student need help because just starting with their student loan we can asure that will not be the only bills that they have. Depending on their major they might have more bills building up.

I think an easy solution would be to go to school to earn a dgree that you know is in high demand. You can&apos;t expect to earn enough money to pay back loans as well as being self sufficient when you have a degree doing something noone desperately needs.
The government isn&apos;t going to pay for jobs with degrees in art or philosophy, it&apos;s like acting or modeling, you can have all the drive and passion for it you want but unless others agree with you than you wont be financially successful.
There are ways of determining which jobs pay the most and that are in high demand statistically speaking. I think if someone cares and wants to pay back their student loans than they will go about choosing the best career choice out there.

In our society, many adolescents have been struggling to get an education but it is so difficult to get an education these days due to the tuition going up all the time. Jobs should be created to the ones that makes an effort to receive a degree. It is unfair or a student to work so hard and then not end up a job sooner. The government needs to create jobs in majors so that students are able to pay of their loan.

I believe students should start paying their loan after a year or two years of working because it gives them some times to sum the amount of money they owe and pay them all at once instead of little by little.I also fee; that they should lower the tuition because it is just making it harder for people to get an education.

If students want to clear their loans, I believe it&apos;s best to not get fancy to early with new cars or clothes but work hard to pay of there loan and maybe sooner they can get all fancy. I also believe students should stay more in community college because it will help them save more money although it might take many years, it will give them the opportunity to save.

Unfortunately students go to school to get an education and most of
them end up in debt by the time graduation comes around. The facts are
unbelievable and they show how hard it is for a student to get through
school with enough money for play. As a high school student, the number
one main focus should be what pathway your education will lead you.
This should give you some ideas on what kind of job you are going to
pursue. There are plenty of jobs in the world for a graduate student
and it only makes it ten times easier to get hired when your
application say“Associates, or Bachelor’s Degree, in such and such
field”.

Many students make the mistake of getting a loan for college classes
and not worrying about when the right time is to pay them back. I
believe that while in school, and working, a person should work hard
and put money away specifically for the loan that they borrowed. If a
student graduates without having a payment plan already set up, then it
might make it harder on the adult with the responsibilities at hand to
get this money back to the financial aid system.

As a college student myself, money is a big issue and always will be
throughout school. Truthfully, I would slowly pay back my debt with the
schooling system so that my loan is paid off, or almost paid off by the
time graduation comes around. I find it would be much easier as an
adult to cope with the large amount of responsibilities if they weren’t
in such a big debt.

College should be free for the first two years. In order for America to become a better working country. We need everyone in the country to be educated. This can be paid for by removing some of the large tax breaks rich companies have.

After the two years, we can go off to a profession school where we can take out student loans for our specific field. I believe the government should at least assist in very low interest loans that won&apos;t need to be paid until after a degree is earned and a job is established. The government should also regulate school tution prices as the current price is too high and must students find it overwhelming to even try to go to school.

One way the government can create jobs is by investing money into energy. Such as solar power, sand oils, and hydrogen. These types of fields would create hunderds of thousands of jobs which is exactly what we need. This will also provide a better future for the country itself.

Well, first off, a student should try every other option before actually going forth and taking out a student loan. Apply for scholarships such as bright futures or attempt to obtain grants. It all starts during High School, The better grades you get then the easier it will be to get awarded with scholarships and not have to take out loans. I was offered a loan for more than $1000 and although I could have used that money to buy books I choose to pay out of pocket wasting around $400 instead of owing the goverment that loan. Loans are something that you HAVE to pay back, they wont leave you alone EVER. So it&apos;s def. a risk that I think you shouldn&apos;t and wouldn&apos;t
have to take if you prepared yourself.

But if you do or must take out a loan which amounts to some big money make sure you actually put that money to good use and study a profession that you know is and will always be in high demand and that doesn&apos;t and probably will never depend on America&apos;s economic status such as something in the medical field. People will always be getting sick/hurt and will always need doctors, nurses,etc. Although you may want to study art or theatre because thats what you love, its not about studying something you enjoy its about studying something that has a good job outlook after graduation and will pay you well, sad but very true. Nowadays you must sacrifice enjoyment and fulfillment in order to make a living.

Jobs can be created especially for students who are graduating with debt by maybe opening small business&apos;s near campus who are involved with the college and willing to hire students after graduation. My suggestion is start paying back your student loans as soon as you possibly can, the sooner the better. How?, thats a different story. If you can&apos;t afford to pay them back dont take them or you could simply save money as you make your way towards graduation. If you start paying back your students asap then it shouldn&apos;t take THAT long, if you pay them back slowly it might drag out into your adulthood but either way, in my opinion, dont bite off more than you can swallow because the goverment doesnt play when it comes to paying back student loans.

With the incline of tuition costs and the cost of living it is no wonder why so many students are in debt and move back with their parents. First of all tuition should not be so high for people trying to better themselves and the country they live in. A college graduate would have more knowledge to make a living out of something useful and needed in society.
Creating jobs for college graduates can be tricky because at this point and in this economic state finding and creating jobs is hard. But ultimately it is up to the government as to how this could play out. Putting more money into organizations where the most students graduate as, would be one resolution. For example if most people graduate as nurses putting more money into growing hospitals; or more money into schools if more people decide to graduate as teachers.
As to when, how, and how long it should take to pay back this loan. Well there should be programs in schools where maybe students can start paying off their debt as they study. For example tutoring other students as they themselves learn. As well as establishments where they work can help with student loans. If the government invests in these organizations then labor should be able to pay back for those that now have a job after graduating. This would greatly reduce the debt of an individual graduate student and with any remaining debt the interest should not be so high that paying the interest alone would be like paying double tuition.

First off, the tuition is way to high as is. In another countries like canada, most of the schooling is free, and for the United States you pay an incredible amount and then you have to take books into account as well. I think that once you graduate college, the college should try and find a job for you mostly as an intern position making just enough to pay off your debt. The graduate can work in the field that they want and pay off the debt at the same time till an opening for a real job comes up. This way they can get experience in the field they want and gain a bit of money to pay the debt off.
Students should have a minimum of 10 years I think to pay off the debt. If they aren&apos;t going to lower tuition like it is in every other country then they should at least give you enough time to pay it off. Basically there should be programs after you graduate that will help pay your debt, whether it is provided by the college or the government. And maybe if you get married to another graduate student, the government should give you a bonus check to help pay it off.
Fact of the matter is once you graduate college your on your own, the way the economy is right now theres no guarantee you&apos;ll get a job. What i&apos;m suggesting is that the colleges get more involved in finding openings for you for an internship and doing whatever they can till you find a real job. Unfortunately aside from that there is really no other way to create more jobs until the economy gets better, they should be more focused on lowering tuition so you don&apos;t have to pay back as much.

Tuition costs have gone up along with inflation and just about everything else. It is stupid to think tuition could stay the same if the colleges have to pay more to run the college. The colleges would close since tuition is the only way they bring money in. Tuition is directly related to our country’s overall economic crisis. Banks are handing out less money for mortgages, car loans, and student loans. New graduates can’t find jobs in their fields if they find a job at all. This is also not unreasonable. If a job opening becomes available in an accounting company, for example, and there are 25 people applying for the job, who is going to get it? The person who was laid off from his job after 15 years of experience, or the new college graduate who has no experience at all? It’s an easy decision for the company to make and, unfortunately for anyone trying to get a job, these companies can be very picky about who they hire.

New jobs can be created by stopping tax breaks to companies who outsource American jobs to other countries and making any companies who do outsource pay an extra“outsource”tax. These companies outsource jobs because of corporate greed, plain and simple. They can make more money by paying low wages to people in other countries. If the cost of hiring workers outside the United States was too high, these jobs would be returning very quickly and would have a big impact on the economy. More money will be flowing and it will have a domino effect, new businesses opening, new jobs, more money, etc.

I also think colleges should stop training students for careers where jobs don’t currently exist, at least temporarily. It’s not right to take money from students to prepare them for a job that they will not be able to find. Palm Beach State has lots of programs that keep turning out graduates who then can’t find jobs. The new Bachelor of Applied Science in Supervision and Management degree graduates are going to find themselves competing for entry-level management jobs alongside graduates with a Bachelor of Science or Master’s degree in Business Administration, and jobs for those graduates are few and far between. Graduates from the police academy and firefighters cannot find jobs because many public service employees have been laid off. When the jobs do reappear, who is going to get them? The new grad with no experience or the police officer/firefighter with experience? Colleges need to reevaluate their programs and concentrate on programs related to where the jobs are, such as health related fields.

There are options for repaying student loans such as deferments and negotiating new payments. New graduates should be given a period of time to find employment which should be a maximum of 2 years. Their loan payments should be based on their income and should be automatic debits. I think offering a deal to students for early repayment, like reducing the total amount owed, would be a big incentive to start paying on the loan as soon as possible. Every five years, the student loan should be reviewed and payments could be renegotiated based on the new income which will hopefully be higher.

The last thing I want to say about this is that students have to stop expecting things to be handed to them. Graduating from college doesn’t guarantee you a job and nothing is going to be handed to you. Too many students automatically feel they are entitled to things, and this is a problem with the generation that I am a part of. Also, there is nothing wrong with living with your parents after you graduate from college if you can’t afford to live on your own. If you move out on your own right away, you will have more debt piled on top of your student loans. If you live one or two years with your parent or parents, you can save money to become more independent, buy a car and maybe even pay off your student loan. Too many of us are too anxious to move out on our own and have everything right away. This is part of the reason students have so much debt.

I think the government and colleges should get together a create a program. It will find jobs in need and that are available during the time they graduate and the colleges will be able to guaranteeing a job for their students. This should give the students a boost of confidence knowing that will be able to have a job when they graduate.

Students should be able to have a monthly or yearly payment plan according to how much they owe. This will give them a chance to live on there own and give them some time to pay off the tuition. This will greatly reduce the average graduate students debt and especially their stress.

Its unfortunate that students go to college in order to obtain a degree in what they enjoy and spend most of te rest of their lives struggling and stressing because they have to pay back their thousands of dollars worth of student loans. Our nation needs people to go to college, we need scientist, doctors, engineers, ect. So why are they making it so dicouraging for people to go to college when they know that life isn&apos;t going to get any easier for them once they get their college degree?

I believe that the first two years of any schooling should be free. In my experience right now paying for my prerequiste classes in which I will never use for my actual major is frusterating. I took history in highschool whi should I pay to take it again if it has nothing to do with my major? I shouldn&apos;t have to pay. If the government wants to make those classes mandatory then they should let us get our foot in the door for free.

Now in order to pay off your classes for your major the schools, in my opinion, should have job search and help services. It&apos;s hard getting a job lately, everyone knows that and being a student on top of that can be stressful. With a little help from the school to get a small part time job it&apos;d make this alittle easier. I think with that job they should take a small percentage out of your income every month to put towards paying off your accumulating student loans, and after graduating college the same job help services should still be offered and students should get a minimum of 10 years to pay back loans, interest free.

When we were all in grade school we were asked a very common question ;“What would you like to be when you grow up?”We answer this question with common answers like doctor, fireman, policeman and some fantasy answer like superhero or even billionaire. through out grade school we encourage to follow these dreams. even through college we work hard and spend tons of money and time to follow our dreams unfortunately once we graduate and enter the real world is that dream career we wanted for so long is it really available for us?
Unfortunately college students face this problem not able to pay for there student loans because their dream job becomes very hard to find. The ability to not pay back student loan due to not finding a job post graduation is a common occurrence. What should of been taught in grade school is to research is that career choice in high demand. That will save a lot of time, money and worry paying back student loans post graduation.
its very important teaching our children at a young age to do research on career. what may have been on demand then may not be need in present time. By solving this issue they will be more students paying back these ridiculous student loans. Which allows them worry about better things in life.

Today we have noticed that many people are going back to college in order to get a degree. But education also has a price. Therefore they start taking loans in order to provide themselves a degree. This topic does not only concern all current college students, but also the prospective ones. We have to start acting now so the next ones will benefit from it.

After graduating college, many graduates can’t find jobs to start paying back their loans. The economy is dropping everyday and the rate of unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate. How can jobs be created after graduating college? First, they should reduce college tuition. In this economy, when a graduate find a job, half of his/her monthly salary goes to paying college debts and they are left with nothing since the company for whom they work offer them a lower wage which is totally inappropriate. How can we survive? Second, industries which are making millions to billions a year should start hiring more people (instead of 5, why not take 10 to 15 people). We also need more small businesses. Now, after a graduate student has found a job, he/she can start paying back his/her loans after a year or two. This will be the time for you to build a financial plan. The amount that they will pay back will be based on their salaries. But most students have a default on their loan because there is not enough income to pay back their loans due to economy state of mind.

Finally, taking out loans for full time students are not easy but in order to get where you want to in life you must make hard choices and in the end it will worth it all. Employment in this economy is not easy but I have fate and hope as I obtain my college degree I will earn enough money to pay off my loan even in this tough market.

The amount of money that college students have to pay is ridiculous. College used to be a place to get a higher education for a job that requires that, and people who knew that they were not scholars could get a job through internship and gradually moving up with training. Now there are people with bachelor’s degrees working at McDonalds. We are all now required to go to college if we want a half decent job anywhere. This is very stressful for college students in general. The amount we have to pay just to try to live is far too much and we are not given enough opportunities to pay off the huge debts that pile up from our education.
Of course if you have to pay something off, you need a job, but that is not easy to obtain now a days. The government should work to reduce the tuition we currently pay and help college students by giving them not only more opportunities to get a job but incentives for being a student and worker. These incentives could be given not only for a regular job, but could be community service, working part time, or interning in a place that is related to the student’s major. It is difficult to just make jobs on the spot, but if students could work without pay in something that relates to their future career and reduce their loans students would do it. Also, if there are more students getting practice and real life experience in their future job, there will be a better-rounded and educated work force to help strengthen our nation and economy.
Students would be able to reduce their loans by up to a particular percentage (something regulated and fair) depending on how much work or volunteering they do. There is always a need for volunteers and it would be easier than having to just make up small jobs for students. Then the students will have less to pay and even make a bit more when they get their job due to their experience as well as education. This is something that I feel is realistic and positive for everyone involved.

The amount of money that college students have to pay is ridiculous. College used to be a place to get a higher education for a job that requires that, and people who knew that they were not scholars could get a job through internship and gradually moving up with training. Now there are people with bachelor’s degrees working at McDonalds. We are all now required to go to college if we want a half decent job anywhere. This is very stressful for college students in general. The amount we have to pay just to try to live is far too much and we are not given enough opportunities to pay off the huge debts that pile up from our education.

A plan to create new jobs and pay back college debt.
America has a National debt. of over 14 trillion dollars. Most people don&apos;t even know what a trillion is or what it looks like. A trillion dollars is a one million millions. That would be twelve zeros 14,000,000,000,000..Last year America borrowed 2.5 million dollars a MINUTE. 4.6 trillion of the total debt is
money that the government has borrowed from itself by writing iou&apos;s takin out of social security and medicare surpluses. One trillion dollars is what we owe on student loans. Creating new jobs and paying back college debt is something that can be fixed, but first we have to fix America.
Our economy is seriously in bad shape. This problem is due to the free enterprise. I am not saying we should not have this freedom, but 98% of the things we buy here in America was purchased from China, India, Mexico ect... This cost Americans there jobs. If all the American stores and Theme Parks would like to purchase merchandise for resale from these other countries they should have to pay very large taxes on them. It should cost more to by something from china then something made in America. This would reopen factories that have been closed down for over twenty years re-open. It would create jobs all over America, every position would be in high demand from the laborer to the ceo. New towns would be built. People would have to build new schools, hospitals, fire stations, police stations,churches new houses. This would have our economy back on track.
Now, as far as school loans go. If this country was being ran right, we wouldn&apos;t need student loans because U.S citizens should not have to pay for college, but seeing how that is not very likely to happen school loans should be consolidated once out of college. We should pay it back at whatever interest rate the bank is paying us to have a savings account with them. If they pay us 1%, 2%,5% interest to use our money, then we should only have to pay them the same interest rate as well to use there money. This payback should start back one year after you graduate from college. This sounds fair, at this time our one trillion dollars in school loan debt compared to our countries debt of 14,000,000,000,000. barely seems like that big of a deal.The government focusing on how much money the college students owe on loans to get an education merely seems like a distraction or cover up so citizens don&apos;t see and the government does not have to focus on the real problems America is having.

With the national dept increasing every day, the amount of jobs is decreasing. More and more people are going back to school to get a higher education in order to get a higher paying job. Many people will receive higher degrees but they cant get the jobs that will pay off their student loans so now they owe more than they can pay off.



People who owe thousands in student loans typically already have a job so providing specific jobs to new graduates isn’t always the answer. Most already try to work one job as much as they can so adding on another in order to pay off a loan is not reasonable. I think that schools should make some sort of work deal with students, if the classes of the field they want to work in can be paid for, they have commit a certain amount of years working in that field, while still receiving some compensation. Unfortunately, with so many people wanting an education, and very few jobs I don&apos;t think it would be realistic.




College tuitions are too expensive, that is why so many students are in dept. One simple solution I see is to dramatically reduce college tuition prices. People would not have to take out such big loans and they might actually be able to pay for it. People could spend more money on other items in the community, which would generate more income, and help the economy. In some countries, college is completely free. Why do we have to pay 600% over what we should be paying, that is where we need to look to reduce the college dept crisis.

College is a necessary evil that unfortunately due to finical conflicts, my feel unattainable to many. In our current economic situation, people are forced to pursue higher education to stay competitive. Students are then given the task of seeking employment, in a nation where jobs are scares.
Our government should pay us for going to school.

Students should be paid for working towards a career that is going to build upon this nation. This would put greater value on primary and secondary educators. Although there still would be an issue on the inequity towards education systems in different urban areas.

Solutions could include better prioritizing government spending. I think more money should go into providing quality education to further develop the minds of this country, and lessening tuition costs. Less money should go towards the comfort of inmates (dehumanizing individuals is the way we reform people in the country anyways, right or wrong that’s another topic), and senseless wars . Students could maintain their campuses, cleaning, working in each department instead of non-student employees, in department that can do so. In return tuition could be lowered, not raised.

Students should only be asked to repay their loan when they find a job. Full time students can’t work and pay off loans at the same time. Interest rates should not be astronomically high. If students are able to focus on their education more quality educated people could be a result. Students should be paid throughout internships.

Our government is a money making business and I personally think high cost for education is DILEBRATE conspiracy to discourage the lower to middle class. Broadening the SES gab between Middle and Upper class.

Being in college myself, as well as having a sister getting ready to enter grad school, the current situation with current loans is really scary. No one wants to start off their lives in debt, but with the way things are going in this country, we almost have no other option. I definitely think there&apos;s an obvious problem with all of this and the fact that our government is simply brushing it off as nothing is shocking.

Six months is clearly not enough time for any student to start paying back their loans. I think graduates should be given at least a year to start making payments. I think if graduates feel less pressed for time, they will in return feel less stressed and it may make it easier for them to have clear heads while searching for employment. I understand that it&apos;s important for students to pay back their loans somewhat quickly as to keep the country from going deeper into debt, but we have to consider the facts.

College graduates shouldn&apos;t be reduced to going back to live with their parents after they graduate. Graduating is supposed to symbolize a start to their new, independent life. I think it&apos;s terrifying to think that after all that work, I may end up right back where I started. It almost makes the idea of college much less appealing to students. That should never be the case. I think more schools should concentrate on creating strong work study programs, and work on setting up internships with various places to help their students get out there and get working as quickly as possible. The time for change is now.

The economic crisis in the United states is affecting multiple regions of the society. For example, in the domain of Education, the majority of the students need to take out loans in college in order to further their education. A big question that they are going to ask themselves is what are they going to do to pay for their debts.

Before the country fell into a recession, this question was rarely ever asked because when the students would graduate, they would not have any problems with finding an occupation. At times, it would be stressful for them to choose between various occupational opportunities.

Today this question has became something of normality because of the loss of jobs in the society. When the students are done graduating, they will not have the chance to find as much jobs or even none. After a long time of searching and ending up nowhere, these students will become saddened by their inability to find an occupation. For many others this question becomes even more complex when a student marries another student with the same financial problems.

Something that we all know of is that there are no problems without solutions. We need to find a solution that is more appropriate to the problem. Since we know that this problem is more towards the fact that the government does not have many job opportunities available, it would be something of thought if the students while still in college would gain a perspective on things and initiative. Instead of asking themselves how are they going to pay for their loans and debts, they should be asking themselves what are they going to do to create their own business when they graduate. If they do this and let it have strong priority in their minds, they will reach this goal, maybe even before they graduate and they will have a mindset and opportunity that is higher than of the students that are tact down by this horrible financial situation. This is achievable because whatever you put your mind to, you can achieve. Now when the time comes to pay for their loans, it is already done and over with. Neither are they stuck in the situation of being afraid of whether or not they can even pay the loan in time.

Finding employment is a definite problem in our country today that affects many college graduates. Eight five percent of college students are graduating in debt, which is causing them to go back and live with their parents. Since 1980, college tuition has risen six hundred percent. Students not only have to worry about tuition rising, but they also need to worry about finding a job after graduation to pay off their students loans. Many college graduates are working minimum wage jobs while waiting for a job offer in their chosen field.

To prevent the increase in the college graduate’s debt, schools should get more involved in helping solving the issue. They should help students find internships or participate in job placement programs, which could offer students a stable job after graduation. Positions that are currently being held by high paying professionals could be divided and given to college graduates who could accept a lower salary. Creating jobs around or near the campus would help students both save up money to pay off their debt or enable them to pay for school without taking a student loan. These could include restaurants, café, or small coffee shops, which would also give other students a place to hang out and study. If more jobs were available, college graduates could pay back their students loans in a timely manner.

It should not take someone an extremely long time to pay off student loans. But factors such as the amount the student owes and the amount of money that they get paid should be looked at when determining the time period of paying the loan back. Students should set personal goals to have their student loans paid off. They should set aside a certain amount of money from their paycheck and designate that money for their student loan.

One of the biggest problems is that everyone feels like they have to go to college becuase that is the only way to get a job that makes you enough money to live off of. If it were possible to live even a mediocre lifestyle on a minimum wage job then why are we seeing single parents working three full time jobs still not making ends meeet. If congress were to realize this and adjust the minimum wage and create more jobs at any level of education this problem will not be anywhere near as bad as it is now. When we have a congress that believes that the minimum wage is enough to live off of and they can barely feed their families off of $400,000 there is a major disconnect that needs to be corrected. (John Fleming R-LA)


Why are we even making a profit off of our education? we should be the most lenient on student loans yet it is the most strict loan you can possibly get. Even declaring bankruptcy will not help a student.I can understand that because you will always have your education you will always need to pay for that but why do we need to. If we are using that degree to help further this country isn&apos;t that good enough to not have to worry about things like student loans?

The next thing is how much education costs in this country. We put such a large emphasis oon free education but then we shut the door to being able to use that to its fullest by slamming the door on your face in college. Why do people need to pay so much when it is in the best interests of the country to have as many educated people as it can. It is said that Private companies run more efficiently can can give those lower prices to the consumer, so why is it that even the private universities and colleges are so expensive, even more than the state run universities? This was not always the case so we need to discover why there has been such a rise in tuition prices and rectify that problem.

We are going through a financial crisis and the times are tough. Tuition is expensive and it is extremly hard for a student not to ask for a loan. Jobs are not easliy to find with or without a college degree. It must is in the best interest of a high school graduate who is attending college to choose the best career. Jobs can be created for graduates to institutions by way of the government.

I believe that the government should pass a law that will help students find jobs easily. This would be a win win situation where the loans are paid off and the graduate stays out of debt.
It is not good for the government nor the econmoy with one trillion of student loans. The graduate should be the number one priority for employment especially if they are in debt. If the govt would step in to aid in employment of college graduates it would really help lower some debt.

Paying back of the loans should begin when the graduate gets a job. They shouldn&apos;t be forced or given a deadline when not employed. There must be an agreement between the two parties about how long they can payoff their loan. In these tough times paying off a loan isn&apos;t easy. The person shouldn&apos;t be homeless because of it. Everybody should not be put in the same boat each person&apos;s issue is different and should be treated that way.

I believe and over regulation of business, employees and an overly complex tax system is counter-productive to job market growth. New jobs based on producing goods and services will build the economy, increase spending and lead to economic growth. If taxes and regulations were relaxed for 6 years on start-up businesses to improve business survival rates, this would promote economic growth which would make more job openings available in the future.

Students should begin to pay back student loans immediately with any excess monies on hand. If persons would pay all extra monies to lenders when they have it, most loans would be paid back in about half the time. Never wait to pay back money.

I am a full time employee (48hrs/wk) who attends college at 3/4 time. I am on the earn, pay and go program. I will not owe monies when I graduate. I believe debt is best reserved for a house and a car only. Of course a person will have to take out credit or loans to build credit for these major purchases. So do it in a fashion where you use credit that you know you have the monies to pay for now.

If a person takes or has student loans or any loans for that matter and can not currently make timely payments due to living expenses; there are several reliable techniques that have be successfully used for centuries. You could move in with others or family to greatly reduce expenses. Some could join the military in the U.S. which has current programs to pay up to 65K off in college student loans. You could marry an older person who already has the means to support you.

My opinion is that the loan should be paid toward whenever extra monies exist and it should be paid until it is paid off completely before stopping payments.

It is my understanding from the print of USA Today that our President Obama has unveiled a plan that would allow student loan borrowers to consolidate both government and private loans together and then cap that loan at 10% of that persons discretionary income. I also understand via CNN on TV that if a person pays on these loans for 20 years and stops paying, it will simply be&quot;overlooked&quot;. When our leaders propose that we do not fully pay off a contract we signed for a loan, it makes me wonder about the state of our social norms. Oh well, that is it&apos;s own blog.

In my opinion, student loans should be different than what they are now. They should have lower interests and there should be a period after graduation where they don’t have to pay back immediately. People go to college expecting to gain more knowledge to get a job that will pay them more than minimum wage. Imagine their surprised to be faced with debt. They should not start paying till 6 months after graduation.

The core issue is the price of a higher education. The problem of loans would be easily eliminated if tuition was affordable. Most people go to college to make something of themselves, they are helping society. I believe that the government is responsible to fix this but without demand from the public, it is unlikely to happen.

Jobs can be created by allowing students to begin practice before graduation. That way, when they graduate, they will have more experience. Also, students will have more connections within their fields. This will make them more appealing to businesses and corporations.

Students in today&apos;s world are being forced to pay rediculous amounts of money for their college education so it is a concern for all of us that when we complete our college that there will not be any available jobs for us to attain. Isn&apos;t the reason that we spend the big bucks so that we can make the big bucks? Students have been taking out loans but what if they cannot pay them back? Loans have to be different than what they are right now.


I would say that the first step would be to create more jobs. If more jobs were available for college students then they could make more money to pay off loans and also gain experience in their chosen careers at the same time. It would be like a preparation for the real world.


If college wasn&apos;t so expensive then people would not have such a difficult time paying for it, simple as that. Unfortunately, not enough people are standing up for lower tuitions so naturally the government is not going to take any action. I believe that students who take out loans should start paying them back as soon as they are able to, I would even say that they have to begin paying back some money within a year after they graduate so that they dont put it off and never end up paying. They should also continue to pay them off until they are done.

I do agree with most of the students comments; that it’s horrible not having a job after going to college for a large amount of years, and after you graduate your left without a job. It’s really scary and that why most people are just picking a job that makes a lot of money and will always be needed, and in the end they are not passionate about what they are doing. I think the people who are in charge need to take a real look at what is happening and remember that our economy will stay this way until they fix certain problems
The government needs to open up or make more institutions so that people are able to work. In doing this, people will be able to apply places and get jobs instead of their names just going on top of a pile. This will help the person and in turn help the country. Jobs can also be created by the bigger institutions that are already established hiring more people. For example, hospitals, or big establishments of this sort. Hiring more workers will keep those working already to be less stress and allow new graduating students jobs.
This will need to be implemented now because there are people out there who need jobs right now. Students should start paying back loans a year after graduating. This will give them enough time to settle down and to start saving money to give back to the banks. The length of time should be until they are done paying off their loans because the banks do need their money back.

Unfortunately college students can not pay off loans as soon as they graduate college and head into the real world. The purpose of a loan is to help students pay through school without having to worry about the expenses. Even many years after the student graduates from college, they might have a big amount of money to pay back. I know that after a while, it catches up to you, and you are stuck trying to pay for these loans without any money coming into your bank account because you don’t have a job. Also the loans should be distributed based on if people are able to pay it back right away, but since this is not the case, we need to have a new strategy.

It is a concern that graduates are not able to pay off their loans. Debt is a serious problem in college’s graduate’s lives. Some jobs that can be beneficial to helping the people out would most commonly be jobs like a waiter/waitress at a restaurant, or a host at a college lounge. This can help the graduate get money easily and it would be a quick solution to pay back the government their loan. Little by little you can pay off the loan including interest. The sooner you pay back the loans; the interest would not be as bad as what it would be if you held off a few more years to paying the government. Internships that pay would be a nice experience to part-take in. They would be able to work on their major and see the field they are getting into while they pay off debt. A job with a salary would be the best choice if possible.

The length of time it takes to pay back your loan is up to the person themselves. If they wait too long, it is going to take longer based on the amount of money they have coming in to pay it off. Students should start as soon as possible to get the best job they can and if they can’t get the best paying one right out of school, try to work that job and keep looking for a better paying one.

As we all know students have loans,it depends on how the major we choose in college the amount of loans a student will owe after college.Either way it is a big issue. it is not guarantee after graduation a student will be making enough money to pay back loans.It is different in every case. Whats achievable for a student can not be for another. Financially most students who have heavy loans go back and live with their parents. The percentage of loans is way to high.One of the biggest problems is that everyone feels like they have to go to college because that is the only way to get a job that makes you enough money to live off of.

A great way to prevent loans is while in school students may have the opportunity to do some activities in school grounds that can help them pay their loans in the future. At the same time the main issue is the price of a higher education. The problem of loans would be easily eliminated if tuition was affordable. Most people go to college to make something of themselves, they are helping society. I believe that the government is responsible to fix this but without demand from the public, it is unlikely to happen.


The best method for paying student loans I think would be for student to start paying after getting a job. But the job must meet a certain criteria which is that student should be able to pay off their student loans, over a ten year period using 10 percent of their salary. As long as the loans interests rates don’t increase and student are able to pay off large sums of the loans when they can this ideas would be efficient.

I believe that one of the first priorities for this nation should be to have affordable education for everyone. It&apos;s ridiculous to even think that Americans have to pay to learn and then half the time be left with a massive amount of debt! A lot of us are just sitting here and letting this go, sighing an&quot;inevtiable&quot;sigh because of these tuition prices but we should be protesting as much as we can. A college student cannot balance going to school and working a full time job so how do these banks expect us to pay these loans back smoothly? and if they haven&apos;t noticed not all college graduates are going to be 100% successful in their work related endeavors .If their career path fails or there aren&apos;t jobs in that field, what does a person do? it&apos;s death trap of a sort and it throws people into a lifetime of worry due to the nasty stench that is money.
If graduates cannot find a job after college I think that the schools should let them have a back up plan where they can pay off their loans by working for the school or set up an agreement with businesses to give them a small job just for the time being and possibly give them a full time job in the future. With unemployment being so high these days I don&apos;t understand why the government isn&apos;t putting money into doing things like this or opening more government related facilities for people to work in. We are the future of this nation, but I guess we&apos;ll just have to just drop out of college and work all our lives in a cruddy job just because our education is so expensive. Too bad...
Another idea I believe in is that once you have a child you should open a college pre payment account. There is a chance that the child wouldn&apos;t end up in college, but either way it&apos;s a smart thing to do just incase. That could help some in the long run, then again some parents don&apos;t have a high enough income to be able to support their kids in any sort of way school wise. Once schools begin to lower their tuition prices, as well as their housing, things will get a bit better. But it all depends on us, who are right in the middle of this dillema, and time in order to make this change.

Today, students directly out of college suffer from a lack of employment that is directed towards their specific degree. Though, the expansion of job diversity would be greatly appreciated throughout the profession work system, people need to pay particular attention to which line of work is piling with unemployment. Nonetheless, it is important to find the vocation that is much desired no matter the circumstances of economical benefits. Vocation is derived from latin which literally means“a calling”, but there has to be an equilibrium between both ideas that transcends the feeling of contentless towards pleasure for the occupation. Seeking of which, Occupy Wall street is the counterculture influence that desires refinement in the economy and one of it&apos;s demands is to reduce college tuition.

Modification that can possibly improve the U.S. job system is the lowering of small business owners tax rates, which would open these business to better opportunities of advertising that would hopefully lead to expansion of the business. If college intuition were decreased, then students would become less hesitate to explore their careers by getting higher degrees. Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) are the areas of study that are in the continuum of advancing technology. These areas of study are in demand of work because of constancy of advancement every day.

The outlook of Occupy Wall street will make an impact on our society. We are people that make the difference. This revolt will provide people with more stability for the superior majority. Infiltrate the 1% that make the decisions for the“well-being”of others, and take back what is rightfully societies. The next president election will hopefully encourage the proposition of control of unemployment specifically towards degree holding graduates.

Looking at the statistics, the huge increase in college tuition and the amount owed in student loans is quite alarming. Viewing it against the backdrop of today&apos;s jobless market makes the prospect for graduating college students is even more bleak.

In order to generate jobs for graduating students, big businesses need to refrain from hoarding profits. Instead of just distributing profits among shareholders and CEO&apos;s, they should reinvest profits into the business. Since we are fully engaged in the world of technological advancement, Big businesses should send headhunters out into the highways and biways to ferret out future Steve Jobs who simply need the opportunity and financial backing to unleash their creative genius. New inventions will need staffing at all levels for mass production and distribution. Businesses could turn a certain percentage of their full time positions into part-time positions in order to get more people into the workplace. Banks should relax their lending standards in order to qualify more small businesses for loans to use as capital to start up new businesses. These small businesses will, in turn, generate jobs. I believe America need to ramp up production here at home in the United States and put more of her people to work instead of importing so much or using cheap foreign labor.

Concerning student loans, I believe loans should be repaid as soon as the student graduates and finds employment. Upon gtraduation, studens should be required to provide proof to the lender that he is actively searching for work. Once they have secured employment, they should work out a payment plan with the employer based on the amount of his salary. Lenders should be flexible in working with students but students should also be responsible and honor their end of the contract. I would advise present and future students to secure student loans only as a last resort and even then, borrow the lowest possible amount. I suggest living with parents a bit longer, take fewer classes and work part-time to pay for them. It will take a little longer but in the end, it will alleviate a great deal of stress and debt.

It is incredible how much we have to pay to become educated. Ironic thing is that not only do We benefit from our education but the country itself benefits from having a more educated population. That is why the government should step in and have more consideration with the students. If they can&apos;t lower tuition, or make the debt considerably shrink, they should give corporations, and businesses incentives to hire people fresh out of school.

If students graduate and immediately get a job once they are graduated, they can immediately begin the painstaking process of paying back student loans. That would be the ideal time to start paying back student loans, to knock that out of the way as soon as possible.

The best way, in my opinion to pay back a loan is not the preferred method, and not the easiest either. But I think that a percent of your paycheck should be taken out and go towards what you owe on your loan. This way, you are never late on any payments and u can actually pay it off at a steady pace.

The question is - How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

It is rather unfortunate to have to agree to these facts, but they all speak the truth about a major issue in the US. How can jobs be created for students in order to assist them paying off their loans after graduation? Being a student with a couple loans to think of myself, I have often thought of ways the government could come up with that would be highly helpful to me and many others. One idea that I had in mind would be to create more activities in and outside the schools where interested students would be willing to pay off parts of their loans by volunteering. Another idea I came up with would be to help the students by offering them jobs at school and have them work partial time to pay up their loans, that way, by the time they are done graduating, a pretty good part of their loan should be completed.

When Do I think graduates should start paying their loans back? They now have two different loans that are available; subsidize and the unsubsidized. One of them is to be paid a certain time after the loan is received while interest is being added. Compared to the one mentioned, the subsidize, is to be paid after completion of education of a student, and only when the first payment is made does the interest is applied. That one is normally the most chosen by students because as long a student keeps a 6 credits per semester average, the loan is not obligated to be paid. But I believe that loan providers should start sending requests for payment only when guaranteed that the student has indeed found a job with the sufficient salary able to take care of him and the loan borrowed.

As far as the how students should pay their loans is not really something that I have bothered myself with. The greatest problem is finding a job that offers a good enough salary. Once that problem is fixed, paying off the loan should not be too hard. The loan providers have established many different pay plans proving to be very effective for students to pay their loans.

Many college students after graduating can’t pay back student loans because there are not enough jobs available. One way to create a job after students graduate from college is to encourage companies to hire new employees with more education. Also to make more qualifications of higher education to these get jobs. To encourage companies to work with colleges and the students in the area specific for the company. If the company works with the college they might hire the students after having seen firsthand knowledge of their skills.

To pay back college loans students should be able to have enough time to find jobs before the bank starts collection. If the bank starts collection after graduating this can be too fast because the students haven’t had time to find jobs. The bank should start billing for the loans after a student has started a job or a year later given the competitive market.

When paying loans back the student should be able to meet with an adviser from the bank to set a monthly payment method. The student can choose a set amount for each month so that they will be able to afford it. The loans should be paid back in a matter of time that varies for the student, when they set up a payment method with the bank they should set a time limit.

If an 18 year-old with no credit history and no job walks into a bank and requests a loan to buy an $80,000 Ferrari. Most bank loan officers would tell him or her not to waste their time filling out the application form. However, if you go to your financial aid advisor and tell him the money is for a private college, where you want to study 18th Century Romantic Poetry, he will help you fill out student loan applications and tell you if you need more not to worry, you can get more. Basically encouraging the student to take out tens of thousands of dollars in debt to buy something that they cannot afford and will not be able to pay off; and given the student’s likelihood of finding a job, what they are really buying is an overpriced and potentially useless college degree.

How is it possible that we have a student loan system in place that forces someone, who is not legally old enough to drink, to make a lifelong decision to incur huge amounts of debt with little thought or understanding as to how they will pay it off? And tells them that if they can’t get a job after graduation, no need to worry, you&apos;re entitled to a deferment if you go back to graduate school, where you can borrow more money. It’s no wonder that the US now in the middle of a College Loan Debt Crisis and that higher education has become modern day version of indentured servitude.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college? The truth is I don’t know; the Obama Administration spent $1.5 Trillion dollars trying to stimulate the economy and create jobs, yet the unemployment rate keeps going up. Throwing money at the problem is not working, so the solution maybe to ease the burden on the new graduates that do get jobs by increasing the 6 month grace period before you start paying back student loans to one or two years. These longer deferment periods should apply to both federal and private student loans. An extended deferment period would allow new graduates to establish better financial stability prior to the start of student loan repayment.

Another idea is to start requiring colleges and universities to be upfront about the job prospects of those who leave their institutions with degrees. Let’s say a school was required to list the statistical likelihood of a new student at that school receiving employment in a particular field of study at graduation; the potential college student could then go to the homepage of that particular college department and see what percentage of its graduates are working in the chosen field. If the percentage is small, it might cause that student to think twice before incurring a lot of debt to obtain that degree.

A step in this direction is a new federal requirement that colleges must create online&quot;net price calculators&quot;for their institutions. These calculators are intended to help students and their families gauge college affordability, providing individualized estimates of what the particular institution will cost them after grants and scholarships. I looked at the Palm Beach State College Net Price Calculator and it does help me estimate my college costs, however it does not help me determine if the degree I will get will actually be worth it (e.g. make me employable in my chosen field). We need the equivalent of a CARFAX®report for college degrees so students and their families can make smart buying decisions.

Everyone tells you that if you go to college you will have a better job and a better life. With tuition rising every year it’s too hard for people to even pay for college with the economy going down and people getting laid off. Now the student’s loans debt is more than credit cards how do they expect a college student to pay it off when they don’t even have time to work.

Students after getting loans through all the years of college now graduate and they are expected to pay off the loan a few months after they graduated but since the economy is so bad 85% of them go back and live with their parents. I believe that companies should get more involved with colleges and start working together to get students into their company like internships while they are going through college so when they graduate they have a job.

Students should start paying their loans as soon as they government sees they have the income to pay it back and be able to live without been broke. They should also start paying it if they get married and the person they get married to do have a debt in loans or if they both have loan debts they should be able to start paying one of and start paying the other after they pay the first one.

As a first generation college student, i haven&apos;t noticed the costs of college and now that it is my second year here at Palm Beach State College, i noticed that they have risen. I do not understand why it has risen so much, I think this makes it harder for students, who cant qualify for financial aid or simply don&apos;t have the money for it.

Creating jobs is one of the issues in today&apos;s economy. Unemployment rate is rising and this is the problem the people we elect for aren&apos;t solving. I think what politicians should do is not revolve themselves around money because greed gets you nowhere. They have to know that there are college students like us come out of college finding no job and in debt. We students have to speak up just like the people in Occupy Wall Street are. Jobs are not easy to find, not easy to get because there is always someone else that is willing to do anything for it so one has to be better prepared.

Students often fall into loans because they have no money, but it is always best to start paying them off right away if its possible. Part-time jobs during college can help a little, but any help is great. Its so tough to get a job at all, maybe that wont work out. But the sooner you start paying the loan, the sooner you&apos;ll be finished with it.

Choosing to pursue your education has its negative and positive aspects. If you decide to stop your education after receiving your high school diploma, you may end up with a minimum wage job. On the other hand, many people plan on continuing their education at a university, vocational or community college. However, Is it worth it? You have to deal with finances and making sure your major is in great demand.

Taking out lends for college can be a legitimate and bad thing. Yes, you may feel it is necessary to do, but in the end you have to pay it back. If you choose to take a loan out, make sure you have a great job to provide your needs and wants. That’s another topic, many college students are getting their bachelor’s degree in fields that does not have a great demand. My advisor told me to research whatever major I planned to get a degree in, and check what the demand rate was going to be in the year I graduate.

In order to stop this problem we should create more jobs. The government should provide a sum amount of money to each job field, so they can hire more people after they graduate. For example, the government should give more money to the overheads in the social work industry. If they do, numerous amount of college students with that degree can be hired and more children can be protected in the system. When it’s time to pay back their college loans, at least 5% to 10% (based on your salary) should be taking out each pay period to contribute to your debt. This should continue on until their debt is completely paid back. You also will have the chance to raise the percentage rate you pay if you want to.

The amount of money that students have to pay back is becoming ridiculous. There is no way that students are going to be able to pay back there loans. The fact that college tuition is up 600% since 1980 is just downright absurd.

There are many things that we could do to create more jobs for our students. There is so many products made outside of the united states in yet it is sold in the united states. This is just absolutely ridiculous. We are outsourcing so many jobs that it is making it nearly impossible for the college graduates to get jobs.

This is making the students resort to unemployment. Which is costing the government. There should be plans that help the college graduates pay back there loans in a more efficient way. I believe there should be a 5 year plan where students dont have to pay back there student loans for atleast 5 years after graduating. This gives them ample time to get on there feet and be financially stable enough to pay back there loans.

With statistics such as those shown, it almost seems like a waste of time getting a college degree. Obviously this is not the case, but it is incredible that the government expects students to pay so much for college when there is no guarantee of a job afterwards. There are many changes that can be implemented in order to create more jobs for college students, or help them pay for college loans.

I am of the opinion that college should be free for everyone. If everyone was educated, then it would ultimately lead to nothing short of vast economic and social growth. However, this is very unlikely, so the at the very least, the government should create more on-campus jobs that go towards paying off a student&apos;s loan. Companies should also be more flexible with their working hours, as they must realize that college students have a strict schedule they must adhere to.

If these kinds of ideas are implemented, then it will be obvious to the student when he should begin paying off his loan, as he will have plenty of income with which to pay for it. Or, better yet, he won&apos;t have to pay for it at all.

This is a problem that Americans will have to face for many years. Many students go to school thinking that an education is the key to their dream job. As it may be a major part of it, they do not realize the competition they will have to deal with. Unemployment rates are at an all time high and students not being able to find a job after college will only add to the rate.

Many students will be forced with thousands of dollars in student loans. Right now students have six months after they graduate or stop going to school until the student loan bills come in. Within this time interest and bad credit could add up in no time with no job. There needs to be a fix to this problem, and it needs to be fast.

Some solutions I believe could help open up jobs for college graduates would be for them to create their own jobs. Many people are in love with the idea with Corporate America and building their way to the top. If college students became creative and starts an entrepreneurship, it will lead others to do the same.

Not having a job can be really detrimental to anyone&apos;s way of life. Especially a college student. Imagine being in school for 4-5 years having a brand spankin&apos;new degree but no one even looks at it...It&apos;s not something I am looking forward too. I am going to school through the use of loans, I do not receive financial aid at all because of income and age. I am working fulltime to pay for what i can now and hope for the best later on. Some say that in a few years when this generation of college students graduate the economy will be better than what it is now but what if it&apos;s not? what are we as students going to do? A way to pay of student loans while in college may be one possible solution. And actually having a job available for a graduate is the major problem.

A student who starts out with less debt than another has a huge advantage. Just because they did a little extra work on campus to pay off their debt before they graduated. A program like this would be very beneficial to the population of the school system. But how to create more jobs is another issue. I see SO many companies being very greedy and making budget cuts and unfortunately they do not realize if people do not work they do not buy if they do not buy they need to make more cuts and eventually their company goes belly up and bankrupts. in my opinion the seed of this problem is greed.

Whether they realize it or not big business&apos;attempt to save money or make more money is causing the problems they affect them the most. Budget cut&apos;s wont help their companies only thing that will is hiring the qualified educated workforce that awaits them will solve the problem. Also 600% tuition increase above inflation is not helping the issue, but hey, that&apos;s greed for you.

I in agreement with the majority of everyone else agree that the rates for tuition or extremely high forcing students to get student loans. I would suggest that the percentage rate at which students are given loans are also high and research should be done into a students background such as work history and financial history to determine the rate at which he or she has to pay the loans back.

In addition another suggestion for opportunities of employment for graduates should be paid internships where graduates and only graduates participate in the field in which they have mastered in to expand there knowledge in the field and which would then open them up to high paying jobs and more jobs.Depending on how much somebody works should be how much he or she is able to to pay off in a short amount of time rather than paying what you don&apos;t have.

I believe a greater emphasis should be placed on students in high school to apply for scholarships so that they themselves don&apos;t become victim to student load debt and the outrages tuition cost.I don&apos;t believe that there is any set time limit on when student loans should be payed back, although the sooner the better if financially able. If someone is not financially capable of paying back their student loans they should not be punished or become more in debt if there is proof that they are searching for a job and are just not able to find employment.

It is ridiculous that college tuition is up 600% in only a period of 31 years. You prepare for a good job by attending collage but when that is so expensive it makes it that much harder. Most college students have to take out loans from the banks at high interest rates and by the time they graduate they are about 25,000 dollars in debt. Your aspirations to a high quality life suddenly sink as you start at a negative value. Not to mention if you marry another graduate student that is also in debt!

Something has to be done to solve this issue because many people can’t attend college because of the cost and many others will remain in debt after graduating. It is more than obvious that the government is not doing anything to help students achieve their goals, for the first time there is one trillion dollars in student loans. Many will remain in debt because they can’t find a job pertaining to their education after graduation. We have to take a stand against greed just like the“occupy wall street”people, we have to elect better representatives. I believe a way to help students with their economic problems is for schools to become involved and place students in internships that will facilitate their job hunt after graduating. Also by working for small business intended to help college students.

This way it would be fairly easy to pay school as you go or to start paying off your debt as soon as possible but still students should have about 10-15 years to pay in case of very rare fields where it’s harder to find internships or jobs . the sooner students pay off the better life will start looking for the future.

Dealing with the recession and jobs layoffs are not an easy thing to do, because of this more than 75 percent of people are returning back to school as it is a way to improve their education and boost their resume rather than staying home and become depressed. However the results are not good for some, since it comes with more than a price and people are never done paying the loans they took because of all the high interest rates. The problem is most people take loans to cover their tuition and are unable to pay it back since jobs are still not available; they are unable to pay it back. So what’s the next step? Is to continue looking for a job.

I think people should think twice before returning back to school especially if they can’t afford it and the only alternative is to take a loan. The risks people take when applying for school loans are unremarkable. This is because if they are unable to repay it, then it causes their credit to be affected and hinder them further. But sometimes we do what we think is a right thing to do and it involves going back to school to better ourselves in the different academic areas. I feel that the loan agencies should give the students options as to how they want to pay them back. One option is set up a 6 months period from the date the student graduated from school to start paying back their loans. And option two is they can pay the loan back, if they want, immediately, either during the course of school or as soon as they’ve graduated. This window is to allow the students enough time to find a job. Jobs are not easy to find due to the economic crisis and the loan agencies should realize that it is difficult to get a job in this current time.

Another option for students to repay their loans is for the loan agencies to lower their interest rates. Many students when they’ve graduated do not always get the job they are entitled instead they have to start off with a low paying job. And most of the time, students are also faced with other problems besides their loans and they are unable to come with the full monthly payments, due to the high interest rates. Also, when students pay their loans monthly more monies go towards the interest instead of the principal and this makes it hard for students to not able to pay their student loans, creating frustrations of never finishing paying their loans out. But the question is now how to create job for these graduates? Well to start off, the government should have the banks lower their interest rates so that not only the small businesses but also the big businesses’doors can remain open. This will provide more job opportunities for people especially the college students. Thus students will then be able to pay back their loans.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

It is a wonderful thing when some one wants to better them selves and and go to school. But it becomes a shame when they can&apos;t afford it. So then people decide to get a loan. In their minds they think they will be able to pay off their loans once they obtain their awesome degrees.

In reality it takes them into debt for over 25 thousand dollars, in which they can&apos;t pay off for years. Reason that is, they can&apos;t find jobs to pay off the debt. In order for students to pay off thier debt quicker something must be done. First of all I think the bank should lower their interest rate. People will never be able to pay off thier debt if that rate keeps sky rocketing. They do have other bills to pay.

Since there are so many differnt types of degrees poeple are graduating with, America should start opening more business that incorpate different branches within them. For example the Medical field has so many differnt branches that people get degrees in but are not able to find a job within that degree. America should also be willing to go to schools and seek out to find out what students are studying so they can open new and improved mini offices in that field. This would provide a way for America to be improved and things would run better. So peole would be able to pay off their debt and others can go to school.

Well looking further into the question why is college tuition up 600%? The tuition for students shouldn&apos;t be so high that everybody has problems with paying back there loans which is happening. Schools should have different programs to help each student get an college education and work for it at the school or pay it back some other way.

For instance colleges should let students work at the school and do work around the school during there time at the college to help pay for their expensive education. Also another way is that if for example someone wants to teach the student would go to school there and when he/she is finished then they have to teach or help in some sort of way to help pay for their school education. Private companies should have programs for there companies were they pay for the students college education and after that they go right into the private company that paid for them.

If these loan agencies would lower the interest rates this would help the students pay it back since its cheaper. Student loans should start being payed back a year after you graduate to give some time to get a job and should be allowed an appropriate amount of years to do it depending on how much you were loaned. With this appropriate time span private industries should help hire some of these young students.

after students graduate from college one way that I believe jobs can be created for them is for the college to look for jobs for them and to also have jobs on campus ready for them to start working after graduation. Another way that jobs can be created for them is for the government to start improving and preparing for them before their graduating date arrives.
To me students should start making payments to their loans about 2 months after they start working on their major, because that’ll give them an opportunity to take good care of themselves, their bills and also manage to save a decent amount left of over to make monthly payments. With the economy being so bad right now, which is creating the lack of jobs I don’t think students should start making payment right after graduation. Because most students whom have graduated recently can’t find jobs on their major and they can even afford to feed themselves, clothe themselves let alone repaying their loans right after graduation. It’s only fair for them to get a break before they start making payment arrangements.
Lastly, its hard to estimated how long it should take for the students to finish paying their loans because to me it depends on how quick they can get a job, how much money their getting paid and how much responsibilities that they have to care for. For example, lets say 2 students whom have the same amount of money to repay, one is getting paid $10 an hour with rent to, car insurance, utility and food to eat and the other student is getting paid $15 an hour with only car payment and insurance payment to make while still living with his or her parents. I think the student getting paid the most should have a fixed amount to pay monthly and a deadline of when the last payment should be received.

The two major problems that college graduates face today is a good paying job and how to pay back the students loans. As the facts stated school tuition has gone up 600% and for the first time there is one trillion dollars in student loans. These facts to me come hand to hand for creating this problem for graduates. I think there is something that the government can do but its our responsibility to make the right choices about taking out loan and picking the right career.

The fact that 85% of college graduates have to move back and live with their parents is unacceptable. I think one way to solve this problem is to have a plan before you graduate with the school about finding jobs in your career. I think we pay enough in tuition do get assistants from the schools about finding a job. Another way to stop this problem is giving the student more information about the career and its demand. Be realistic about how many people really do find jobs and make it a career. There is nothing worst then going to school for 4 years and then finding that the demand is very low. Yes there is a problem with work places leaving united sates and thats when the government should come in and help because they have the power to stop the companies from leaving and this would create more jobs.

The facts stated that most graduates start out with a $25000 in debt is mind bobbling. I think people should do more research about their career and school before they take out a loan.
The research will help determine if the career is worth taking out the big loan and if your going to be able to afford it in the future. Also doing research about the school can save you money because every school has a different tuition. I think after you do your research and see that the loan is needed then get one. I think once the student graduates they should start to pay off the debts. Im not really sure how long it should take because some people have less or even more then 25000 dollars in student loans. I think as long they pay for it constantly and the bank gives them low interest they shouldn&apos;t have a problem paying it back in timely matter.

There is work to be done on both sides. First of all, to create jobs, the upper class needs to start creating more non-governmental organizations with the specific purpose of hiring fresh out of grad school students because it is very hard for the average graduate to compete for a spot against experienced people who&apos;s been there and done that . On the other hand, a student should be smart enough to realize that it&apos;ll be extremely hard to find a job depending on which career they choose because of the density of the people that have the same degrees as them. They should find out which career will be in demand over the next decade or so to help them make the right choice. The country has given us so it would be in all fairness for us to give back. With that being said, I think there should make an exception for grad students with debts to find jobs easier.

Once you graduate it&apos;s not like magic dust falls on you and you&apos;re going to find a job right away. It takes time, with that being said I think they should allow students at least a year or so after having graduating to start paying off their loans depending on how high the debt. In addition, the students will have more financial responsabilities to take care of.

There shouldn&apos;t be a specific period of time given for a student to pay back their loan.The amount a student pays monthly should be based upon how much money they make. With this method, it&apos;ll make things easier and faster.

In today&apos;s day and age it is highly unlikely for anyone to get a good, stable job without some sort of education or training after high school. With college tuition being so high and with the combination of today&apos;s economy being so unstable, of course a graduate student is going to have and outstanding debt. There are many things that can be done to create jobs for graduate students to help them start off on the right foot in the real world.

For instance, instead of making tuition so expensive, take some of that money and start some kind of program in the college or university that will create jobs for students/graduates that will benefit the school and whomever attends/attended. The government can also help if they really cared. Instead of being so worried and greedy about how much money goes into the pockets of politicians, be useful and create a program or service or internship or whatever that is a training or something similar that will prepare the graduate for what is to come and will also benefit them financially. When you look at it, it&apos;s like the ripple effect; fixing/tweaking the simplest detail will in turn affect the greater counterparts like the national dept and the economy.

In my personal opinion, I would suggest that a graduate start to pay off their loans ASAP. With interest rates being so high and banks being the extremely greedy companies that they are, the faster they get rid of their loans the better off they will be. If they were to wait and take their time paying off the loans they would in turn pay more than what they were originally given and it would be a losing situation for them.

The facts that there is a problem with the education system not only with the issue regarding student loans but also underpaid teachers. Today it is a fact that most students return home after completing two to six years in school in hopes to find a job.

According to the facts the student loan tuitions went up 600% since 1980 which was only 31 years ago from today. This goes to tell us that the educational system is decreasing due to lack of jobs and poor pay over the years. The United States Government should of seen this problem emerge with all there financial advisers that they should have, being the world leading country if it still even is.

if the government had a federal program that was created to assist in finding jobs and had an agreement with school to give more money if they assisted more in helping college grads find jobs after they get there degrees. also loans shouldn’t start being paid for until acquiring a job after the first year of graduation to give time for student to get there life going and thing settled and be more stress free instead of having to worry about paying back money before they even graduate.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

This happens to be a very good question which needs to be recognized and handled in the proper manner. Education is very important and definitely a necessity in today’s world. I believe if you have completed x amount of schooling there should be a guaranteed career somewhere out there. It’s really discouraging knowing that after you graduate from college there is a great chance of you being in a worst predicament then before. Being that college tuition is extremely high, many students are afraid to continue educating themselves. Afraid that after graduation nothing will come from it except another bill.
Having to take out student loans for education is absurd. I believe it’s a set up for failure. I believe that the government should open their eyes, to how many opportunities would be available if student loans and interest rates were actually not in place or reasonable. I think more and more people would actually try to better themselves. I feel if the government was more in touch with trying to help and educate more people; America would be a better place. I suggest that student loans should be paid back after, at least 3 years of working if your married (after graduation), and after 5 years if your single. Reason being I don’t believe in graduating from college, then living with my parents just to be able to pay back a student loan.
I believe there shouldn’t be a certain number of years indicating when to pay back a student loan, As long as payments are actually being made. Hopefully, this situation is brought to someone’s attention and they realize they have many options on how to help society. If this one particular issue managed to get resolved, a lot of great things can arise from it. Such as more job opportunities. Having to educate more people will lead into schools needing more educators, which can become a snow ball effect into other fields and many more careers. I also believe that student loans should be ones last resort. High schools should push more and educate potential college graduates on how many scholarships are available.

Life after college is becoming more and more difficult, especially with the downturns in the economy. Many students do not have the luxury of just stressing over exams. Now they have to worry about having a job during and after college, often relying on said job to pay or help pay tuition.
As the world becomes more and more technologically advance, many jobs that were once done with the hand are now controlled by it. Technology makes many jobs obsolete, but many more are created and students right of college could take advantage of these newly created jobs that are needed everyday. Examples are web designer or marketing engineer. Another option that creates jobs for students are small business be it by the student themselves or another entrepreneur. Small business can open up new markets and provide many jobs for students.
It is widely known that many students exit college with debt. It would be very helpful if loans could start being paid back after the student has officially started their job. This would give it a much higher likelihood of being paid back. Having a minimum of six months after graduation to find a job before some kind of penalty is applied could also is a good idea. Loans these days for a student is ridiculously complicated, making them easier to handle would help the student in the long run.

It has become increasingly more difficult to find emplowment after college. Many students have no choice but to move back in with their parents, after spending thousands in student loans.
In the past, college graduates could easily find high-income employment. But today, many college graduates are sitting in low-income employment struggling to pay back their loans.
The easiest way to pay back student loans is to not have them at all. I attended University of North Florida for two years, and in that time I accumalated a total of 25,000 dollars in student loans. Looking back, I wish I went to a community college (paying out of pocket) for my underclassman years. It was not worth the money to take AA level courses without knowing my major.
A secret in the loan community is deferment. Many students don&apos;t realized that can postpone paying back their loans. If you have a low-income job, or are job-hunting you can defer your loan for up to ten years. Signing up for military activity and community service organizations can also post-pone or cancel your loans. Health Care and law enforcement officers can also cancel old student loans.

It is amazing how there is a number of people attend school for years with the intention of graduating with a degree to be able to go out into the workforce and have a successful career, but once they have the degree they can not find a job. And then on the other hand there is a number of people that do not have the opportunity to attend school because of the tuition cost, or some just make the decision to not attend school because they do not want to take out student loans.

I feel that students should be informed of what careers are in high demand so that they do not go into a major that will get them no where after they graduate. I know so many people who are majoring in certain things and i just think to myself why? Students should sacrifice the first couple of years in college to do something that will get them a job because it is in high demand, then go back to school to major in what they really want. That way they will have a job that makes good money, then they can have the oppurtunity to also have a degree in what they love to do.

Paying off student loans in my oppinion should be up to the student. Just like a credit card, you pay what you can. It was not your fault that the government did nothing and does nothing to help with tuition costs.

We are granted the privilege of receiving financial assistance through the government, and it is always in our best interest to pay what we receive after completing our higher education. It has been stated that the best practice is to pay the loans no later then six months upon graduation. Partnering with the loan carrier on a lower interest rate would allow one to have a time limit on what they can return from the investment they have received.

If the graduate is placed in a great paying job then they are permitted to pay the loan in a matter of five to ten years assuming that they are consistent with the repayment plan. If one decides to purse another degree they could either place their loans in deferment meaning they would stop the payment and continue once they have completed their degree. If one is able to maintain and pay the loan during their continuous of education then they should.

I believe before any student graduates from their undergraduate they must seek an internship from their junior year on or early. This will give them an opportunity to find a career in their field or something similar that they can build a relationship with. Having completed these internships would make one more desirable to their future company they are seeking employment with. If a student fails to complete an internship they could also market themselves through volunteer services through certain felids that will allow them to receive the experience they need to receive certain positions.

As I was doing my research on college graduates I came across couple of factual point on college graduates the average college student is now more than $20,000 in debt at graduation. The average salary for a newly minted graduate, meanwhile, is $30,000. Well now it make sense to me when college graduates says&quot;the heck with it&quot;and simply take on more debt and paying back as little as possible of their student loans as they can get away with. If you&apos;re smart, though, you&apos;ll make a concerted effort to get out of debt now while you&apos;re still young enough to make it count. In my opinion that is best to do.

College graduates who default on their student loans face significant personal and financial burdens. They become ineligible for additional federal aid and may have their wages and tax refunds seized by the government. Their negative credit records make it harder for them to obtain car loans, mortgages, and credit cards, and even apartments or jobs. When they can get loans, they pay higher interest rates. I would recommend any students start paying off their loans while they are still in college if possible. And if you&apos;re paying off those student loans, make sure you&apos;re taking the deduction on your taxes. It&apos;s also important to repay the highest cost loans first. To make things easier.

If you happened to lose your job there are various option you can take for example It is very important to know, before you start missing your payments, to go back to your lender and tell them you&apos;re struggling, There are a couple of options for those who can&apos;t pay them back including deferment and the best thing you can do, if you&apos;re facing any type of financial hardship, whether it&apos;s medical bills, a loss of a job, you go back to the lender, you explain it to them. Much better to do that early as opposed to when you&apos;re actually really facing problems with the loan.

I live in a house hold that consist of two college students so this topic really pertains to me. I am the younger of the two, my sister graduated from UCF a year ago and is just now experiencing the hardships of paying back her debt. She is worried about the money she owes and she even had bright futures too. When I leave to UCF next semester I will most likely be in even more debt because financial aid has been cut back on and I am not getting nearly half as much as I use to in pell grants. The worry of having to pay off debts will soon fall onto me also.
How should we be allowed to pay off debts once we have graduated college? I feel the college should supply us with work placement positions and help us find well paying jobs. The campuses should create a community that is mostly run by graduate students so it will be easier for graduates to find a job.
I do not mind paying back a student loan, but the amount of the loans now are way too much. The price of the loans should be based off of how well you do in class. For every A you would get 75% off for that class or something similar to that. This would cause incentive for students to do well and help schools excel.

Today&apos;s economy doesn&apos;t allow many opportunities for anyone to obtain a job. Let alone a college student with little to no experience in the work force. This is when graduating students have a difficult time because they need to pay off their student loans, and no one is hiring.

To avoid this issue, I believe the college should make jobs available for the average student to pay off their debt. For example, hospitals should pay for a students education and then that student could do an internship at the hospital and pay back the money the loaned them. This would allow them to gain experience in their desired field as well. Also, a group could be developed to possibly clean up around the campus or highways. Which in the long run, would help our planet overall.

The time allotted for graduate students to pay off their debt should depend on how many years they went to school. For example, if a student received their doctorate degree, they should have about 10 years to complete their payment back to the company that loaned them money.

The severity and potential detrimental effects that this issue has on our domestic economic situation makes me wonder why this problem is not being rectified quickly. Lawmakers have allowed for college tuition to drastically increase over the years and seem to either not care or not deem this problem as a priority.Being in the worst economic time since the Great Depression, coupled with college tuition being up 600% does not seem like a recipe for success in my eyes. Lawmakers may argue that they cannot control what colleges charge for tuition but for sure should be able to implement laws that take some pressure off of college students backs.


I think the most obvious and uncomplicated solution for helping students at least start to pay back college loans is providing university sponsored jobs. The jobs could vary from titles that utilize the students&apos;degree or just jobs that they would contract to outside companies or individuals. I feel thats it is unfair and uncompassionate of college institutions to raise tuitions knowing that most students will not be able to find jobs to pay them back.


Because I believe that the college institutions are mainly to blame for the higher recent student debts I feel that they should make the first move in rectifying the situation. Maybe if college institutions make this step in correcting this wrong, it will finally awaken lawmakers to this serious issue at hand. Ultimately though, this issue is hurting the college student demographic, who holds great numbers in our population. If college students could collectively and seemly organize themselves as one voice, someone will have to listen.

Students today rely on their parents to take care of them since students don&apos;t have any money to pay off college. A high school student should at least look for a job during their sophomore year to start saving for college. Even if it&apos;s part-time, it&apos;s better than having nothing at all. Some businesses can&apos;t afford to open new opportunities for those unemployed. Nonetheless, it takes time for an economy in this situation to recover.

A great student shouldn&apos;t be able to pay off loans or let alone get loans. If students study harder in high school, they should get a scholarship that would pay off college. Though competition is big, every student should try their best and if it comes to work, find a job during high school, get a good loan, and start saving up.

As for the long run, any job will do. Serving tables at a restaurant or delivering the newspaper will do. As long as it doesn&apos;t interfere with someones studies, it should be fine. However, it should be the parents of a student to start saving up at an early age. There are some programs out there that benefit students when they enter college. If colleges want bright students, then they should as well help them. Then only will the college benefit from it.

Looking at these statistics is very alarming and unacceptable. Getting a higher education should not be this expensive. It’s very sad to think you spent 4 to 6 years in college, now your $25,000 and you can’t find job. A college student should be able to find a job after they graduate from college. Imagine being in school for this long and once you graduate you can’t find a job and no one takes a look at your degree, well that’s what many recent college grads are going through today. That’s the reason why people go to college to attain a better paying job after they graduate.

Universities and colleges should be required to place college students in internships in their degree field one or two years before they graduate and that way students can get connections and have some real world experience or on the job training. With that being said, another thing universities should be required to do is participate in job placing programs with big companies or even local companies around the college. Not only will colleges participating in these job placing programs give students jobs it will also help the local community having people with higher education working for them. Having a job after graduating from college, the students can pay off their loans, and not default on their school loans like many have today.

Colleges should give students two or three years to start paying back their loans after they graduate. This gives students time to find a job, get adjusted, and save up some money to start paying back their loans. By doing this it doesn’t make their situation that tough and makes it less stressful after graduating and trying to find a job. After graduating students shouldn’t take 15 to 20 years on paying back on their loans, it is way too long. A reasonable time to pay student loans is less than ten years, and if you can’t pay your loans in less than ten years government should pay off the rest.

The way to create more jobs for graduates would be to first lower rates on student loans. If students are force to pay student loans right out of graduating they will sett;e with the first job that they can find to pay back the loan. They might get stuck at that job and never realize their full potential in the career of their choice. Which will just keep them in perpetual debt.

However if they are allowed to pay back the debt once they have the job they want, they will be better equipped to pay back the loans and will pay all of it back. Once you have people in the jobs of their choice they will be making more money. This in return will cause them to spend more money causing the creation of more jobs in all sorts of fields. It will take a while but in the end it will benefit the economy.

Another way to create jobs would be to have programs with companies where there would be a guaranteed job for a student with a certain company as soon as they graduated. This would be harder because you cannot gauge a companies growth years from now. So it would be best to tackle the problem with the student loans that will resolve everything. Once a student is out of debt they will be able to spend and save money and start stimulating the economy.

This situation is very touchy to alot of students struggling to pay college tuitions.many students need to pay for classes, but cant.Jobs need to be made in order for alot of people to pay for these classes. i think that the gorvernment should get little buisnesses that are making good money to hire students that are struggling to pay classes.the students should be put on a waiting list to get hired from a small buisness.
Students should start paying for classes when they have had a legitamite job within 5 years.Being in det,especially when it involves alotof money takes awhile to pay off.or maybe each year they can pay a certain amount every 2 months.
Paying certain fees every 2 months sounds reasonable.it will give the students a chance to get paid, but they will have to take the responability to save and pay for some classes within months. Jobs are very scarce tahts why so many people are living pay check to pay check, so higher authority should step up and create more jobs.

Truthfully , the way the economy is right now job creation is not an easy task. However, in order to create job now it most start with investment, and lower corporate taxes. Money of us companies are moving abroad to do high production costs and taxes. Our tax rate production costs is not competitive with countries like china or Mexico; therefore many companies settled in those countries.

Continuously, I believe for job to be create the government have to invest in the people not business first by investing I mean lower taxes. With more money means more spending. Statistic shows that American a great consumers. If they have the money they won’t be afraid to spend it. If more money invested into the economy it will create more jobs.

In regards to students loans, it’s a shame that college cost that much. My brother only in his third years at FAU, you can even imagine how much his student loan is by the time he graduate he will owe more the average. Truthfully, I don’t think its right for graduate students to start paying the loans six months after graduation regardless if they have a job or not. I think the way the economy is right now, it would be fair if they could start paying their loans after a year or so; or maybe when they finally settle. By settle I mean when they get a job and not living back home with parents.

This is an interesting topic because is something that needs to be fix. Actually, my brother just graduated from College with a bachelor in business and administration and is back at home, living with my parents, and looking for jobs. In my opinion, I think this is sad that its happening to many graduate students because after going to school for so many years and spending all that money, they won’t be able to work in the field they graduated for months or even years. 

Jobs can be created by many ways if the colleges or universities help students find jobs. One way that jobs can be crated is, by having colleges and universities have any type of partnership with big companies that let students work as an internship with a low pay to start with. As the student progresses and have more experience, they would be able to work for the company or for others companies that require experience before working with them. Another way the jobs can be created is by giving small companies an easier way to open, such as given them more loans and not taxing them as much as bigger companies. Also, another solution that we can have to have more jobs would be for colleges to hire more students to work on campus while they find another job. Even though they would not be working on their field, at least they have something to start with.

 As jobs need to be created, student’s loans need some adjustments as well. It&apos;s ridiculous that some students have to start paying their loans six months after they graduate when it hard to find jobs nowadays. They both go hand in hand. As a solution I think that students should have at least a year or two to start paying their debts. Above says that&quot;Graduate students starts out with $25,000 in debt&quot;when in some cases it&apos;s even more than that. I don&apos;t think the problem is students getting loans to go to school, instead education it self its expensive, therefore colleges should lower their prices and help students to get an education at a cheaper cost. Colleges can also offer jobs that would help them pay their education so the student would not have the need to get loans. If the students have to get loans, the banks should be more flexible when it comes to pay back. If the banks are not whiling to be more flexible then I think the government should get involve because the graduate students and soon to be graduates are the future of this country.

It is sad to believe that a country as strong as this one would have such an issue with education. I have heard countless times that students now-a-days pay more than ever for college and the facts above prove those statements. Sometimes when you think you&apos;re the best out there; you end up being wrong. Why doesn&apos;t the USA figure a way to help the students as other contries have done.

I know of a few countries that college is free. All that is required is that you give back to the community. Like in Argentina; if you&apos;re studing medicine you are required to go to poor communities and help the sick. That is of course with no pay. That is the best that can be done to help the debt that so many college students face today. In my eyes that is a fair trade that students can do with the country; you give us a free education and we give back our time to help the country as needed.

As for jobs; just let there be a way we can sign up for a program that would guarantee us work after we graduate. The faster students can start working the more taxes they would be paying to the government and therefore help the country. There is no need for students to study so many years and then once they&quot;re done they are denied every job oppurtunity. That in no way or form is fair to anyone. If free education and job programs work in other countries why wouldn&apos;t it be the same with the USA? The government just has to open their eyes for once and see that.

I believe that students in America should be given more than what they are given now. Educating America shouldn&apos;t be a painful process for those who are willing to be educated. Lowering the price for schooling for students could greatly help boost our economy as well as help future issues in repaying loans and finding high enough paying jobs. Putting a college student into the real world with a great education but an extremely high debt almost seems counterproductive; there are better ways to solve his issue at hand.

A great way to boost the economy and help students all over America would be to have specialized jobs at entry level, specifically for college graduates. This entry level position should have great pay along with great benefits. College graduates could also be given the opportunity to give back to the community by helpin local schools or colleges in teaching or tutoring. By giving back to the community, college students should have a way to reduce or significantly lower their loans from school. I believe that a program should be created just for students and their loans, and how giving back to the community takes a certain dollar amount off of their loan.

Upon graduation, students should be given a grace period up to 3 years after graduation to begin payin back any students loans. Student loans should also have an extremely low interest rate for the first 5-7 years. Having lower interest rates can also help by lowering the payments and having a smaller total number amount due at the end of the term. I believe students should be treated differently, helping educate America can be just the thing we need to turn this economy around.

Growing up all young adult hear is college is the route to a successful future. That all dreams or goals can be accomplished through a diploma. With a diploma the skys the limit once you find that job. The problem is just that, findig the job. Since our last president everyone knows the economy is not stable and more and more americans face tough decisions daily on how they willfeed their families or provide for the future. The answer that has been instilled in myself as well as my peers is a good education. But what do we do when the system of education seems to more it more difficult to achieve the promises guarentted to us through a diploma.

As the facts show college tutition ha gown up 600 percent since 1980. As well as the average debt of a college student is 25,000 dollars. The hypocracy of that figure is astounding. The fact that with the job market on a stand still and no hope of fixing it insite colleges stay open wth the promise that through education a better future can be achieved. Yet colleges and universitys make it harder each year not only to get into their institutions, aswell as raising the price of tuition far greater then the educational value of the infomation being taught.



At 25,000 dollar debt after graduation, that number is greater then what some graduates in certain fields would make in a year. How can jobs be created for students after graduation? By doing what was promised to us from adolescence. Create a work force job agency designed for those graduates ready for the work force. Have banks give loans to those students with MBA&apos;s, then they start their company and hire the human resource manager from their english class. Or the architech from chemistry class to design your new business. Giving the oppurtunity to those who know and understand the turmoil peers are facing after graduation will put graduates to work and the economy on an upswing. Students should be required to pay back loans when he or she gets the job that they intened on achieving when they first enrolled. Adults say the children are our future. We are the children and its time to allow us to take this world into the future.

Reading this blog made me stop and think for a minute. American students should not have to pay such a high price for a education. Colleges and Universities should be at a lower cost so everyone can afford going and become more than they had ever hoped to be in life. With more graduates, our nation would be in a better place. Perhaps one of those graduates has a solution for providing more jobs for that 9.1% of Americans that were left jobless.

I think that after graduation, there should be numerous businesses that are connected with the school that can give students a job after graduation. I am a pre-nursing major. I know that sometimes hospitals will pay for your last year or two in school if you sign a contracts saying you will work for them. I think this is fair and it also helps with tuition. It should be that way with all majors to at least help students.

As for paying back loans, I think this needs to be started right away. The faster you start, the faster you will finish paying off the debt. Banks also give a certain time of&quot;forgiveness&quot;if you cannot make a payment for a certain time due to job problems. Make a monthly payment you can afford and increase once you start working full time.

Every year college tuition increases therefore every year greater loans are taken from banks. Now this students that have had to take huge loans out need to figure out a way to pay these loans off. The problem with this is that getting a job right now seems almost impossible.A big change needs to be made in order to stop this on going cycle but what could this change be?

Well, my idea is a little bit different then everyone elses. How about students pay for college by working for the city they attend college? This way the city benefits and the atudents benefit. There will no longer be a need for loans to be taken out. This on going cylce would finally be able to stop.

With this method more students will attend college which means more restaurants, more bussinesses in general would have to be opened. This would lead to more jobs. And with
this method we would no longer have to worry about student loans.

How can job created?....Well, its hard to say where we stand in what we call United State of America. We students can&apos;t do nothing about creating jobs when we students graduating college. Only the government has the power to created jobs. These Government people are getting pay tons of money so they need to come up with the best soluation. Plus the college that the students are attending never say students was going to get a job right after they graduating. So that its either way.


If the students did graduate and got a job right after college, these people would have to give these grauate students time to pay their loan. They also need to know that students have bills and problems too just like everybody else. So i woulld give those students time to pay their loan. I would say after two years because these students actually have to find jobs 1st. How would they expect the students to pay their loans if they dont have any income coming to them.




I would say after they get their jobs and wait for six months before they start paying. I would recommand them to pay every two week and at least 30 percet. If not, i would charge them at least 2 percent of intrest because they have other bills to pay.

Back in the days credit card debt was high but not anymore compared to student loan debts. Many students once they graduate high schools think big going to top universities and fall into a trap. In order to reel students in, universities will say they will help you find a job once graduated which they do but there is no guarantee that the job is yours. So once a student is trap they must get loans to pay for school because school isn&apos;t cheap. At PBSC each class is about $280 or around there and that only if you considered a resident of the country. If the student is out of state the price is around $1000 and that is just the price for a state college, universities must be double or even triple that. So with classes being so expensive, students take out loans and end up with extreme debts.

With all the problems our economy is going through now in day with there being no jobs, inflation, greed, etc. going on; student debts is just adding to our problem. Another thing that its bad is that those who take out big loans for school are ending up going back to live with there parents and going to normal college but still are in debt. Its very sad to see that sometimes the students have no way of paying back the money because they have no job.

So in my opinion i believe that something should be done to help out people when they graduate from college. I think that those students who have debt should start paying but slowly after they have successfully graduated. But not right the second they graduate if not after they find a job because if students are put to start paying debt right after school they have no way of paying if they don&apos;t have a decent paying job. After finding a job i think there should be like a system for example there should be a period like 10 years and each month pay a small amount.

Creation of jobs for students after graduating would be great especially when it helps those students who are in debt. I think with every graduating class of each specific subject there should be a creation of a business that has to do with the major of students.

College tuition has risen six hundred percent. The number of applicants attending college will continue to grow as well. A helpful solution for current students would be to provide them with a work program which benefits the student body and campus by working around the campus in part time. Also new regulations can be made through college career centers to ensure hiring. Colleges can also attempt at making more flexible schedules for older students who have families.

With increasingly flexible schedules students with many family related responsibilities such as parents can have the opportunity to further concentrate on their education. However more loans are going to be needed to create jobs as well. Businesses need to begin to spend and banks need to lend more loans in order to spread the availability of jobs for graduates. Advertisement of growing careers can also help to improve the number of professional workers in these positions as well as those growing careers which require a Associates Degree or a four year from a community or state college such as graphic designer and physical therapist. This would apply accurately to the quote&quot;spend money to make money&quot;.

As new careers grow more precise and it will be very helpful to train ealier for them. This can be done by training high school students in certain fields of computing and computer graphics.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and how do you suggest they begin paying their students loads back and for how long.

I think the government should create a program for graduated students. The reason I mentioned that, most companies want people who has 2 to 3 years of experience, but they do not even care if WE the students need to start somewhere.

In my point of view the government should cut back on unnecessary things. They are not really focus on education as much, but it seems like college tuition is increasing semester by semester without reasons in my eyes. How we the students can have a good education without adequate financial aid. Being educated is good, but I do think many people might seek out other ways of learning instead of college.

The student should start paying back their loans when they have a steady job on their major. I do not believe this will happen because colleges now are more about getting pay then educating.

Having people dying in hospital parking lots because they are unable to afford a hospital trip in the country with one of the best doctors in the world is a disgrace of the highest levels. Peoples lives should come first. We based large parts of our military and culture around the concept of&quot;no man left behind&quot;but if it requires and emergency room trip then we just forget about all of that.

Health care should be a right of every person in the United States. If we took what we spent privately and moved that to taxes and public health care I have no double that we would have a noticeably positive impact on out health care system. Medicare and Medicaid is already one of the most efficient government programs in the United States, extending that opportunity to everybody will cause good things to happen.

The moment that the institution that people rely on to survive becomes a for profit organization is the moment that their priorities need to be evaluated. The United States already spends more on healthcare than any other modern country for very little effect. I believe this is directly linked to the fact that every dollar spend being used for treatment is another dollar that the owners are not actually profiting off of.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and how do you suggest they begin paying their students loads back and for how long and how?

Jobs being created for students after colleg begins with having programs befor we get out out of college. Just like students can intern at places that will help there majors how about a program that also pays studentst there last year of school so students can already have a job lined up and already have money saved in order to start paing back college loans.
I believe that government is so addmit about students paying back college loan becuase there looking at is as if this was just some loan students take and blow away, but the fact that this is for an education that i believe college education should be free and the fact that its not and in order to further your education 9 times out of 10 we need these loan and this is 1 of the reasons why so many people just dont bother to get there college education. these loans that we have to take out are already at a high intrest rate and if that would just go down or at least give students more time to pay it back i believe we would have alote more graduates in this world. so yes i do believe if the government made it more finacially reasonable alote more people would have the means to attend college and actually further thre education after completing there 4 years and goin on to getting there masters and what ever else they need.
students can begin paying there loans back by finding some sort of income and just taking out what you can on a monthly basis, just bascally making it one of your prioritys so you will not fall behind. but if life gets in your way wich it woill or else this wouldnt be life then have a fall back plan or keep contact with the collecters and just make the minimum.

Health care should be universal for everyone in the United States. Many other countries are already providing universal healthcare. In addition to universal healthcare, there should be no bearing on age to decide whether you deserve health care or not. Who is to say that a 12 year old should get care but a 13 year old should not? I feel it would be best to provide universal health care to all US citizens.

The financial responsibility of health care should be split 50/50 between the US government and US tax payers. By having universal healthcare, that would mean that it would be government run and favored over private responsibility. No one should be denied health care even if they cannot afford it.

It has been shown effective that a country using Universal Health Care is beneficial to the countries overall growth and health. By having universal health care you open up health care that will be given to many people that cannot afford it already, this way the population will be happy and healthier. This means more efficient workers. This is the proposed plan I would suggest and it has already been effective elsewhere.

The FACT is that jobs create graduates and not the other way around. Graduates don&apos;t deserve jobs simply because they graduated from college. Jobs are created and exist via a market system called the&quot;Jobs Market.&quot;Like any other market, it is ruled by supply-and-demand. A good economy stimulates business which stimulates the job market. If you want to&apos;creat jobs&apos;you make an environmnet conducive to business and not invent yet another government program. To stimulate jobs reduce the corporate tax rate, reduce unneccessary regulations, and make it easier for companies to conduct business and hire people in this country.

As far as paying back student loans. This is also makes some assumptions. Why has the government allowed tuition rates to increase 600% in the last 32 years. That&apos;s faster than the rate of inflation. People are fooled into thinking banks and corporations are greedy and corrupt. HA! Tell me a bank or coroporation that has raised it&apos;s prices 600% in the last 32 years. There must be congressional investigations into why such and increase and tuition must come down. The answer isn&apos;t how to pay off student loans. The answer is bring down tuition which will bring down student loans which will make them easier to pay. You have to find the root of the issues in order to fix the problem and not simply fix the problem&apos;s symptoms.

The way I see it in order to get a job after school there must be demand for the graduate. The government should do whatever it can to increase the demand for graduates. Again, a government bailout of students forcing corporations to hire is not the answer. There has to be legitemate demand which means economic growth. Students are more likely to payback smaller loans. Bring tuition down and adjust tuition with the rate of inflation.

Jobs can&amp;should be created for recent graduates possibly through local municipal governments, local agencies, like social services, and local school boards. They can reach potential graduates through job fairs like we have now. Also the government can give tax incentives to hire recent graduates.

Students that graduate should be willing to work off student loans by becoming employed in areas that would better serve their community. Like teachers, social workers etc. Students should also be given a certain amount of grace period before they have to begin paying back the loans, depending on the amount owed, in order to establish themselves which might also be an incentive to take the lower paying position in their community. A student should be given the opportunity to either work off the loan or pay it off, however all loans should be paid back in one form or another in full.

When it comes to college tuition and student loans being up 600%, which is just unheard of, I believe the government should step in and regulate these fast increasing rates. I mean lets face it, jobs want possible employees to have college degrees not just a high school diploma ergo why make going to college nearly impossible with colleges having such high tuition rates and then students knowing that they have to pay off these ridiculously high student loans. All this does is creates more problems and stress for students. Also not only is the job market at a low right now because of our economy but also the jobs that recent college graduates seek to pursue either are not hiring or will not pay them enough until years down the road to pay off these loans.
I believe colleges and the government need to create some sort of program with different jobs where students who are set to graduate soon can have paying internships, rather than giving them an internship without pay and no guarantee of actually having that internship become their paying job. With a paying internship it allows students to get their feet wet in the field that they want to pursue and also giving them a head start on paying back their student debts.
Now government is beginning to cut different college&apos;s budgets, which then cause colleges to increase their tuition so they can make up the difference, government should be regulating the rising tuition costs. These rising tuition rates make it hard for students to go to college and also for students who want to better their education. Granted there is financial aid to help with the costs but financial aid has become too consumed with the rules and not what their goal of being created was for. That goal was to help those who can not afford college get assistance from the government. For instance if a student or a student&apos;s family makes too little to afford college but too much for financial aid&apos;s standards consequently they&apos;re denied. So it then makes it hard for students to pay for it so they turn to the other alternative, student loans. But as for paying back student loans there should be some sort of pay program where students can begin paying it off once they have a set paying job that they&apos;re secure in. Or maybe even have some sort of minimal discount if a student finds an adequate paying job within a certain amount of time from graduating which would help ease the stress of paying it all off.

Jobs can be created after students graduate from college if they plan ahead of time. Whatever degree students are seeking prior to graduation, they must have volunteer experience or lower level experience within their field. The reason so, is that when they graduate, they are more likely to qualify for a job. With that being said, that would make less of a hassle and be proper planning so that they are not sitting out of a job after having that degree, just because they have no experience or skills just knowledge.
When students have loans, it is best they start paying them off while they are still in college. Paying the highest cost loans primarily or setting up an auto-pay is a very wise thing to do. Like credit cards, it is very important to pay them on time or else there will be repercussions. The student is looking at withheld future tax refunds or social security checks for their late payment.
How students should begin paying their student loans back and the time frame is simple, but can be complex if not handled properly. According to a news business and economics correspondent, students should make a list of all the loans, and everything they owe. They should be knowledgeable on the loans terms and aware of the time frame to pay them off, and percentage rate the student is getting charged a month in order to maintain that loan. So basically, whatever terms they agreed upon for that loan is how long it should take them to pay it off, unless the unthinkable happens. If it ever came a time that a student is struggling to pay the loan, options include deferment (postponement of a loan) and explaining to the lender the circumstance beforehand, opposed to waiting until the problem occurs with the loan. This could save a lot of trouble and stress.

With a growing economy and growing population, more and more people are going out and getting their education. Many spend years in college and graduate school trying to earn a degree and hope for a well paying profession to keep them going in this very demanding society. I believe that for someone who spends so much time during their life studying hard for something worthwhile, jobs should be created and saved for those people. The only way this can happen is through government support, school system support and even form groups within communities to raise awareness for keeping the job force open to those who spend years in college, and for those who hope to begin their future right after they graduate. It isn’t fair that they must wait to get a job or even go back to living with their parents just because all of their hard work isn’t“needed”at the time.
After receiving financial support and student loans in order to help out with very expensive education, students should be able to decide when and how to return the money. A student goes to college to be able to make more money in whatever they decide to do. Sometimes, fresh college graduates come out of school without any money and must build themselves up in order to pay off their debt. The only way to do this is for the government and banks to give some space to the students and to give them some time to find a job, begin working and making money in order to pay off the money. They should also choose their monthly payments and how much they must pay each month to the banks in order to begin paying off the debt. Overall, the way a student must re-pay their loans should be taken into their hands by choosing when and how much to give back at any given time.
College education is at it’s highest today, especially the cost of college education. With the help of the government and the people, finding jobs for graduate students should become very simple and easy so that students don’t have to suffer after graduation. Their loans should be paid back whenever students feel they have the money, and it shouldn’t matter how long it takes to re-pay the loans, as long as the debt is eventually paid off.

Considering the state of our current economy, it would be difficult for almost anyone to be able to fully afford college. This is making it very difficult for the students who are about to graduate or have already graduated considering they can not find adequate jobs. Some students decide to go to graduate school and with the average person having $25,000 in debt because of this reason, some think it just isn&apos;t quite worth it. Some are even having a difficult time trying to work as unpaid interns because some companies just can&apos;t take on the liability.
I feel as if the students should be able to pay back their loans a much easier way, such as working as a TA for a semester or two and taking what they would ear and putting it straight to that debt. It makes it much harder to eventually buy important things, such as a house or even renting an apartment because their credit will be compromised because of the massive amount of student debt. The government can start giving out grants to students who can&apos;t afford to pay off their loans so they can at least get the education they need to catch a job that pays them enough. Ultimately, students should not carry the burden of massive student loans around especially because they are all just trying to achieve a brighter future.

I think the main problem with education is the high the tuition. Students should not have to take out as much money as they do for a good education. The government should give more financial help to everyone in general, we want citizens of our country to have more education, it betters our society as a whole. I&apos;m not saying that the government needs to cover 100% of tuition for everyone. But I do believe every single student should have at least some free money towards their education, having an average of twenty five grand in debt upon graduation is a travesty and needs to be stopped.

Emphasis should be placed in schools on what jobs are in demand before students decide on a major, and the government aid for high demand jobs should be 100% to near 100%. This will bring in all the man power needed for new age jobs such as clean energy. No jobs have to be&apos;created&apos;they just need to be easier to access, all students should have a direct link to a job after school, whether its an internship or full time job, no able bodied young person should be out of work.

The Students loans (that should be minimal) will be paid back once the student has a steady job, a few pay checks in (about 4 or so depending on the salary) after they are already graduation. There should not be a set time that this occurs (within a year of graduating whether they have a job or not for example). For the bank or government to get their money as fast as possible, this again links back to the schools getting them jobs upon graduation. What needs to be done in general, is to take more of the financial pressure of education off of the students, we want our people to be educated, not fearing for the financial hurt from students loans!

It is safe to say the students who dedicate years of their lives to bettering themselves through education should not have to carry the enormous burden of debt following their graduation. The worst part is that with each higher degree they earn the thousands of dollars continue to pile on. It is hard to persuade a student to reach for a doctorate when in the end they will be left with anywhere between twenty five to seventy five thousand dollars burying them in debt.


The government and people need to work together to not only make college more affordable, but also make paying back the loans simple. First off, the government needs to look where they are putting their money. I believe the government wastes plenty of money each year that could defiantly benefit students in their education. For example, Alaska’s“Bridge to Nowhere”wasted one million dollars just in promotion. That money could help thousands of hopefuls attend schools of their choice to pursue their careers.


In addition, they need to make paying back the loans easier and faster. For instance, they should find a way to provide more paid internship while students are in schools so that they can be earning a little bit of money to contribute to their debt while also gaining experience on their career path. Another thing to consider implementing would be to somehow let your debt clear up from the government’s generosity after so many years. For example, if you obtained a job after schooling and you have paid back the amount designated each month for seven years or so then the government will take the rest into their hands and declare you debt free.


I think it would be challenging for the government to implement these new ideas, but I think it is something to be looked at and considered if they want to make sure these young adults have the opportunity to pursue their dreams.

We not only have to create jobs for people just out of college but for every one else in the US who is unemployed. Currently the job market is very competitive because of our economy and people who work years for a certain degree no longer go and work in tat field anymore because of the lack of jobs. I think we need to get our economy more stable then we can start creating more jobs, also we can stop exporting our jobs to other places around the world just because the labor is cheaper.

The fact that the student loans have become such a burden on people is sad. The government should either help pay for school or lower the interest the comes with student loans. If a student has to pay off a loan I recommend them starting as soon as possible. If you have a stable job you should try paying off your loan as much as you but you still should be able to live comfortably.

If you have trouble paying off your loans try to work out a plan in which you can pay your bills (housing,car,etc.) and still contribute some to pay off your loans. If you have no other option you set up some thing with your bank and they might be able to help you with your loan. Your loan won&apos;t go away until you pay it all back so make sure you pay the whole amount needed. The opportunity to go to school and further your education shouldn&apos;t cost as much as it is currently, hopefully the government will step up and relieve some of the burden from those students.

With college costs going through the roof in a number of cases many are asking whether some college degrees are even worth pursuing or more importantly students are seeking answers regarding value. The market took the 216,000 job losses as good news for some but the recession is much deeper than the headlines are showing and then it has ever been. A college degree no longer protects you from the rise and fall of the market. For the first time in record keeping history, the unemployment rate for those with four year degrees or higher has passed the four percent mark. Majors such as Arts, Architecture, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences have higher unemployment rates than others however each field struggles enormously. Actually statistics shows forty percent of college graduates end up settling for jobs at McDonalds, Burger King, Movie Theaters (jobs that&apos;s not in the field of their actual degree). I understand a job brings in funding regardless of where it&apos;s at but ten times out of ten an individual attends college to learn and graduate in a field in which they enjoy! I believe it&apos;s the government’s responsibility to grant each graduate with a job from their field directly after graduation. Rather it requires bringing about a hundred thousand more jobs or ten, that’s the least they can do after raping our pockets
with college tuitions!


The massive increase in college tuition needs to be explored. When you think of someone going to school to pursue a career in let&apos;s say social work, is it really worth going into $100,000 to $150,000 in debt for a career that pays $30,000 to $40,000 a year? My answer to that question without doubt is absolutely not! Tuition is unquestionably too expensive. A large number of students are struggling with the government not making matters better. I applied for financial aid and didn&apos;t qualify along with fifteen other classmates of the twenty-seven totaled. The government needs to farther look into who they distribute
funding’s to.


You have those students who receive financial aid only because they have lied on their applications but the honest one such as me gets no help! Not receiving free financial help which we as hard workers will surely appreciate gives us no other option but to turn to loans. What honestly makes you feel that we are able to pay back loans when it&apos;s a bit of a struggle to pay for classes and books alone? Not to mention tuition is rapidly climbing. No one from the government hears us yelling to the top of our lungs about tuition and its expensive funding’s, but they seem to comprehend ways to overwhelmingly take our money! Furthermore that brings me back to loans instead of free assistance. However or whatever rate an individual is&quot;able&quot;to pay back their loans he/she should at least be granted that opportunity. If it takes twenty years OH WELL...If you guys would have helped from the start then you wouldn&apos;t have to wait period!

Student loan debt is one of the most insidious forms of debt. You can&apos;t get away from student loan debt no matter what you do. Federal bankruptcy law makes it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debts and many recent grads end up with loan payments that absolutely devastate them financially at a time when they are struggling to get on their feet and make something of themselves. I feel two years after graduation is when graduates should start paying back their loans. Especially when the average Graduate Student starts out with $25,000 in debt.


There are millions of young college graduates running around wondering where are all the good jobs. All their lives they were promised if they worked really hard and got good grades that the system would reward them, but that is not always the case! Quite often you can do everything right and by the book, but still end up jobless and in debt! It&apos;s sad to say but that&apos;s how it is in America and the economy is actually getting worst..

I feel the government should be able to look at the percentage of grdauates from colleges and that would help them get a good idea or planning jobs. The government is helping many student become eligible with grants to persue their education. The thoughtful idea would be for the government to make decisions for this, they are providing the sources for individuals to accomplish a higher education. It should be their job to continue and let individuals to succeed with their careers. Even if businesses build and make more stores in different and more areas that could help as well. Also, the governments, federal buildings, and county and states could expand to have more jobs available for the higher educated individuals.

I think they should start paying their student loans back a year from when they begin work. This could give them enought time to make plans with thier new budget. It depends how much they owe to decide or made a decision to know how much time they need. Every individual is different so, one might need five or even ten years or more. Once, and individual take a loan out the counsel or advisor should make suggestions or some type of agreement to come to a conclusion to decide how long.

Paying back loans could take a persons how life, sometimes we die and our loans or debts are not paid. While do community service or voulteering at the site or college where they graduated from. Once, they begin working at least a year a percentage or amount could be taken out their paycheck. If it cannot happen that way maybe the individual could make a monthly or annual payment towards their loan. I think once it has reached five or ten years or more it should be payed off. Depending on the individaul income it could take longer for them to payoff loans.

America is a capitolist country, no matter what that is our identity. America claims to be such a great country by providing a free high school education but the oppotunities you get with a high school diploma alone are severly limited. Since the recession more and more people are starting to go to school looking for opportunities to qualify for limited jobs. The education business has capitolized on this by drastically increasing tuition annd book prices. A new edition of a book comes out almost every year without a single significant change in information. Publishing companies and book writers will change a few words and add or remove a page or two and call it a revised updated edition and students are forced to pay for. Rooming and boarding is also extremely expensize to own espicially when your paying for a 400 square foot room that your sharing with another roomate. Alot of families are signing leases for apartments for their child because its so much cheaper.

Advanced education in America is a business and we see all of the factors that contribute to the claim. So where does that leave the students? Well we are left paying back all of these expenses with very limited support from the government. Though there are intership programs and scholarship programs they all pale in comparision to the full rides that athletes get to represent the school. The government actually made it harder to recieve scholarships and lowered the amount of scholarship money given to those who are blessed with a scholarship. This meaves more and more students in debt when there college careers are over.

A student finishes his four years in school and has a degree in his profession. Now its time to look for a job. Students arent able to find a job because som many people are now qualified to work the same job that you are working. So now you are in the same position you were in when you started school except you accumilated $25,000 dollars in debt. So what does the student do now? Goes back to school and tries to get a masters degree in their field hoping to propel their chances of getting a job. This student is now just accumilating more debt for themself.

My proposal to fixig this problem is to remove the business aspect of advanced education from America as much as possible. Make school more affordable so the average student doesnt owe as much money and America will be in a better financial state of mind.

Today, College tuition is ridiculess with the prices for example The university of Miami is about $53,000 a YEAR to me that just completly upsurd. Last semester i went to school up in New York but before i left they told me it would cost me as an out of state student about $10,000 a year but a about a week later i went to the financial aid office and printed out my bill and the the price was $22,000 a year with room and board!

I was forced to comeback home after a month because i couldnt afford it at all plus it was just too much loan to have for only one year. Although the Government is trying to help alot of people to be eligible for grants and etc in order for them to be able to get that career job the money is just too much for most students to afford even most imes with an academic scholarship.

I believe that the proposal to the problem is to cut down in the tuition and ESPECIALLY the Inntrests that comes with thats the killer. making college cheaper is what should be done so more kids can come and learn become more educated get that degree so they can get a job and maybe the unemployment rate wouldnt be so high like it is now.

I think that while the student is in school they should also have a job. With this job they should have a separate savings account meant only for school savings. This way by the time you graduate you won&apos;t nearly be as far into debt that you thought you would be.

If you aren&apos;t able to find a job or you want to dedicate all your time to school in order to finish quicker then you could wait to work at a job until after you graduate. But if this is the case then you need to be living at home with your parents or somewhere that you don&apos;t have to pay for rent. Because there is no way you would be able to pay for rent and a car and other expenses along with saving for school at the same time. Unless your job was an extremely good paying job.

One opinion that I do have though is that the prices for college tuition needs to go down. A lot of students don&apos;t want to go only because they know they would go into huge debt. This is causing them to miss out on the opportunity of good quality education. And then it&apos;s keeping them from getting a good job which is causing the unemployment rate to go up.

These facts are repulsive and to know that as a college student you are trying to better our future and the world we all live in, isn&apos;t enough to make you go to college when a friend is bar-tending and making more then you. What are the incentives for you to go to school with no jobs even open in a majority of fields.
 Jobs should have an intern period so that students can be active in their fields their last two years of schooling so that when they get out they know that there is a job for then through a specific company as long as they do what they are supposed to. These jobs should offer students hands on work so that they can learn the morals and ways of the company so that at the end of the internship they have a new employee with a degree and who already knows how things run and work.
 Now when it comes to loans it is almost impossible to come out of college with a degree with out owing anyone any money but it is possible to owe very little. I believe evey college student should work and attend class and go to a state or community college for as many years as possible so that the tuition is lower. Every student should also be putting any money away extra that they have for classes next semester. Now this might seem intense but classes are not a surprise we know that we need to take them and when they are coming up, I believe if you prepare properly you won&apos;t come into a marriage in the future owing so very much. But schools also need to lower tutu ion rates because honestly their is no way an education needs to cost so much why can college be free like a public school, what the worst that could happen we produce more doctors and scientists for the future. I cant get over how the first 12 years of our education here in America is free but when it comes to the stuff that matters it&apos;s I&apos;m possible to learn anything and not be in the poor house.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

Well after so many years of tuition going up, and jobs not being available to new, high educated students then the some that were hired in the past I think much needs to change in a business off than the outside world. In that sense I mean this, business are always looking to grow but they can&apos;t grow with old new that have to grow with news and the only way you learn whats new is to get newer higher educated employees and I think that places should have reason to open up job positions for new students. People just getting out of 4-7 maybe even more years than that of education did it for a reason, they were told that a better education bring better jobs. In the recent years though students have had to settle with whatever they could get because their particular field had nothing available to them, more jobs need to be created. Even though the economy mite not be in the greatest shape but with more jobs brings more business more money to be made and possibly bring our economy back up to par.

Due to the fact that many students go to school on pell grants, and scholorships for their first 4 years, school isn&apos;t close to being done. To get a higher education you need to get more than just a 4 year degree and that costs money which causes student to pull out loans, students loans were made to give students a chance and they have but they have also put them back years because of the fact that their are no jobs to create an income to pay back these loans they have taken out. When a student loan is granted to you there are rule, it can only be used for education purposes and you have 6 months after graduation to pay it which back when jobs were easy to get was reasonable because thats about how long it took if not less to get a job.

Years down the line though things have drasticly changed, students are back to living with their parents and doing all they can to get jobs. Settling with even the smallest jobs, with the least amount of salary income just because they need something to start paying down debit created due to school. I believe that banks, student loan givers and debit collectors should give students more of a break, i think now that the employment rate is a lot lower they should extent the time needed to pay the loan by and yes it may slow down the banks income and what not but landing a job isn&apos;t as simple anymore. The other thing banks need to do is possible monitor everything that the loan money is being used for and make sure that people are really using this money for educational purposes only. In the near future I think there should be more ways to evaluate getting student loans and also a big thing would be the way FAFSA is determined, people that shouldn&apos;t be getting&quot;free&quot;money still are and that is because FAFSA is to generic, It may ask your income but it doesn&apos;t ask you what your bills are like and how much it costs you to keep a roof over your heads and food on the table. I believe that more people would be getting educations without student loans that actually need them if FAFSA was done correctly and the people that could afford school without it still would, which inturn would mean more income to the colleges.

Two of the many major problems in today&apos;s society are unemployment and debt from student loans. College graduates are faced with the harsh reality of debt early, and find it really hard to deal with while trying to get situated. Unemployment is also a tough reality as well, there just is not enough jobs availible and well qualified people sitting at home waiting for an opening. These problems have always been relevant in society and are always going to be unless we come up with a viable solution.

College is very expensive, and who knows where we would be without the help of grants and scholarships. In some cases, the grants and scholarships aren&apos;t enough and students turn to loans to pick up the rest of the slack. The loan will provide the student with the money necessary and will ask for it to be paid in full once the education is complete. Many people struggle with the payments and some enter an early onset of debt. One solution for this problem would be a more accurate and feasible payment plan. Students can pay small incraments at whatever rate they choose until they pay off the debt. At times it could be really unfair to finally get your degree and career and then start off with a huge debt. The pressure should be eased and the student should pay when they please.

Unemployment is another huge issue, a lot of it could be because of the international boom. The international business surge is taking away many home front jobs. One example is in the automobile industry, GM moters and other companies are finding hard to keep pace with the international market,so in order to save money they release employees. One way to fix the unemployement is to reinforce american products, to create a demand for them. Another solution would be to branch out internationally and open up American jobs in other countries, it could possibly help relive the economy and the unemployment as well. So, many people have been complaining about the issues as college tuition continues to rise and availible jobs decline.

How can jobs be created after students graduate from college, and when and how do you suggest they begin paying their student loans back and for how long?

United States is facing an economic crisis from witch it&apos;s not getting out anytime soon. In hope to alleviate the impact they would suffer, employers fired a huge amount of employees from their companies. To their surprise, the ones that got to keep their jobs picked up the slack. Employers found themselves having great results by using less workforce wish meant more money for their pockets. the greed in their mentalities has caused the problem to worsen or to stop healing. Jobs cannot be created from thin air, they are directly influenced by demand wish with all the unemployment is very low. The only solution is to bring the old jobs back so the demand raise and the cycle can continue.

As for the second question is quite simple, as well as health care, is something we all need therefore it should be affordable to all. with the prices of tuition and text books combined, college life can change from a dream to a nightmare. many students do not have the money to pay all the expenses and aren&apos;t legible for financial aid. This students end up asking for loans that also come with high interests. Once they graduate they may have a huge debt, and possibly, no job. They end up on their parents house, while in the eyes of neighbors, they are seen as parasites. Is not like they have much choice though. If the prices of school were nor that high, they would be living on their own.

Colleges should have a program for graduates in wish they are given a job related to their degree for a couple of years as training. that way they can earn an income and experience on the field they studied so they are prepared for the work environment.

As Americans we understand there is a major problem with graduates either coming out of college without a job and or in dept. I believe the biggest problem is with the student loans. The reality is, we use and need more blue collar workers than white collar. Therefore, it is harder to create a surplus of jobs that require a superior education. People should be allowed to come out of college with a regular job and not be in dept. Also, shouldn’t people be allowed to pursue an education without necessarily pursing a job? What about the pursuit of knowledge? There should be a system available where people can graduate with a degree, then not demand a high paying job to get themselves out of dept. If the dept is gone, there is less of a need for a“high paying job”
So where is the solution? It is in creating a less expensive education with jobs that have a minimum wage that actually qualify with a minimum wage. Minimum wage was originally defined as the minimum income that would help an individual sustain his or herself with a shelter and all needed living supplies. Minimum wage no longer qualifies as minimum wage. Minimum wage is nearly half of what someone would need to live on their own. This must change for all educated or non-educated people.
The hardest problem to solve might be the expensive education. For some unknown reason the cost of education is skyrocketing. Where does this money go? It probably goes into advertisement, campuses, books, and teachers. But how can it be so much that people will walk away from college on average $25,000 dollars in dept. This is after using grants, scholarship, parents, part time jobs, or any other form of help. How can a school like FSU which has over 40,000 students not pay for its campuses, books, advertisements, and teachers? If schools literally need that much money, then the government needs to do something about it. A solution could be found either in slightly taxing the U.S. or changing government spending.

I believe there are many ways that jobs can be created, after students graduate from college. First off, I believe there should be required internships. This allows students to really experience first-hand what they&apos;re getting into. They learn much more when they do internships. These internships can either be paid or not. If the student does well during their internship, they should have some time of promise of getting that job when they graduate. The facility where they interned should offer them a real, full-time job. As the population is growing, more places of business should be opening as well. This provides more jobs. Schools should make it their promise to help students land a job in the career they are pursuing.

I believe students should pay their student loans back a year after they land their full-time job. I feel that interest shouldn&apos;t be added onto that year as well. How can a student pay their loan back once they graduate? That doesn&apos;t make sense to me. If school was their #1 priority, where will they get the money from if they weren&apos;t working or if they were only working a part-time job. The price of living has risen drastically. Gas alone is about $4.00 a gallon. Once they get their feet on the ground and begin to make some actual money, they can begin paying back their loans.

With a payment plan, how long they take to pay back their loans depends. I understand that interest needs to be added on, in order for the bank to make money, but it shouldn&apos;t be a large amount. If the student saves, they can pay the loan back in a small amount of large sums. If not, they can pay it back in a large amount of small sums. The interest should vary on the student. It should depend on the career they got into and how much they&apos;re actually making.

Students should have a job through out college to help pay for tuition. Working while in school would actually make it somewhat easier to maintain their self determination and pursue their degree. Not many people are able to maintain a passing grade while work at the same time but if they are able to do it the outcome is great.

I feel as if students should be able to pay back loans whenever they are ready. Based on their career choice, how long it took them to complete school, and if they were successful or not should determine how much they would ultimately owe back. That way no one feels like they have been ripped off or failed at any point in time.

With the economy still bad and the cost of tuition increasing nothing is easy now days. Every choice that is made now is pretty crucial as far as school goes. No one should encounter any problems because finding work and trying to finish school is hard enough and the everyday challenge can impact someones life dramatically.

This a serious problem to us students who are going to be the new american generation. there should be some kind of assist that once you graduate from a college with a degree, the college will help one self with a job and earn its work experience. which now in days that what most people are looking for.

For the loans, I believe that its best that the student should start paying there loans soon as possible to start decreasing their numbers bit-by-bit. moving back to their parents is the best way to save up some money and don&apos;t have to worry about rent. if we can&apos;t be positive that we get a job after graduation, how are we suppose to pay back the loans. that just makes are life more difficult.

especially now with the tuition going up like crazy. its like there trying to have no one go to college and expect us to get a career without a degree. if the tuition is going to continue to increase, well at least the government should give out more grants instead of loans to the people who really want an education. if the government does that, than the nation should be stronger in years to come.

College is a commitment. The institution of college is also a business and as such, it must be able to keep up with modern day cost. These cost consist of many factors including: student supplies, facilitation, technology, parking, employment, among 100 other things. For the large number of students on campus, accommodation for each must be met.Student loans are commonly the method used to afford college.

Everyday we complain about prices going up on gas and food. This business has the same concerns. But the function of this business is to conform us into having the knowledge to improve our work and country so it is just to believe that this should be affordable for every american.

I&apos;ll start with how Student Loans are a great effort. Simply fill out a FAFSA form and you get free money in theory. But alot of students do not have the information to comply with FAFSA and the age of interdependence constantly raises. At the moment, 24 and single is considered independent. I do not suggest lying to the government on FAFSA
so if the FAFSA system would make it easier for students to apply, the amount of stress and out of pocket fees would be gradually lifted. Personal note, i hate that form.

The next point of measure is I know my fellow students won&apos;t agree with this but we as students must work harder for our finances to afford college. This meaning spend the time for scholarship hunting, not facebooking.
With this infinite pool of money, student loans will not be required.

I know nothing of how state regulation complys with national law involving colleges so but there may be a solution within that area.

Now assuming you graduate, you are now in debt? How are you expected to pay that back! By working a profession that you have a new found knowledge in. Jobs are scarce. I cannot say how to create new jobs because jobs vary by profession and location. For example, a job in animation would be more profound in California then it would in Montana whereas a nursing job can be acquired in any state in any town. I do not have the knowledge to say a positive statement on new jobs of any short.

In summary, we as students must grow to keep up with the growing institute of education.

Creating jobs cannot be done directly by the government. To create jobs the government should simply reduce business regulations and lower business taxes, that would give big business incentive to grow, and as they grow they will hire more employees. The government cannot force businesses to hire people, therefore the only way for them to increase the workforce is to hire everyone themselves.

Graduate students are taking out loans just like any other individual, and just like everyone else there is a risk to that loan. College students must realize that if they do not acquire a job right out of college it is not the fault of the banker, it is their own. The banker did not ruin their interviews or choose the path of their major therefore to blame the banker for trying to collect on the money they lent you is simply wrong.

I suggest that the money be paid back within 3 years after graduation of school. This gives the graduate enough time to look for a job, and earn enough moeny to start paying back the loan without putting to much of a financial strain on them.

The how is easy, The bank needs to be paid back the same way it lent out the money...in cash. If the graduate cannot pay the loan back, that is the risk he knew he was taking when he was borrowing the money in the beginning.

At a number of University’s and colleges depending on the career path, a number of majors allow students to graduate and almost instantly find a job based on their degree and their able to start working. I think that if after graduating from college a student was guaranteed a job no long than 3 months after receiving their diploma that the debt they got into while attending college will be easier able to pay off because of a professional job. If the government can find a way to make this happen this wouldn’t only benefit the student but the society and unemployment rates also.

Students should be encouraged to have a part time job while going to college instead of allowing their parents to be the main income sending them to school. If the student had a part time job, that would be money coming in helping to better able pay off loans and not waiting until graduation to tackle the debt that accumulated over the number of years.

Depending on how much the student is making should determine the period of time it will take for them to pay off the loan. Taking whatever income that is coming in they should set aside a portion of money to go towards paying off the school loans and remain consistent. For example, every month a certain amount of money should go towards paying the loan until it’s completed paid off. Try to avoid putting off the payments because in the end that would ultimately make matters worst.

The fact that college tuition has gone up by 600% in such a short amount of time is unbelievable. Students are coming straight out of colleges and universities all across the country and are immediately stuck with thousands of dollars worth of debt due to the loans they were forced to take out so that they could afford school. It seems hard to succeed when we have a mark against us before we take even one step toward starting our careers. The government should definitely be devoting more financial aid to college students to help us stay out of debt. Our government needs to financially encourage students to pursue degrees, so that all American job industries can be filled with more qualified workers. This would lead to increased productivity and quality of life throughout the whole country.
To help combat the growing problem of new college graduates being unable to find employment and consequently pay off their student loans, both the state and national government should dedicate more funding to leading businesses in every industry so that more internships are available. Interneships are a great way to ensure that students are well suited to the major of their choice, and they also serve as part-time jobs in many cases. Again, this would lead to better qualified workers and provides fnancial aid to students at the same time.
Finally, the government should begin taking steps toward changing the way students are made to repay their loans. There should be a longer grace period that would allow students more time between graduating college and starting their career before they have to start making payments. Students should be able to find their bearings and stand on their own two feet financially before making payments on their loans. Also, the interest rates should be lowered and penalty for late payment should me minor and subject to the situation of the individual.

I feel that once a month government could make some sort of a job fair that is accesable to everyone in the public. Making it a better way to see what is available in your community. That way at least you have a tool to try and find a job to pay off your newly earned debt of school.
The government also needs to put a cap on the intrest rate the loans are at that companies give to college students. If there is nobody going to school everyone loses the banks, our country, and the person who didn&apos;t go because of the expense. If we could tackle at least one thing that is making this an issue it could help tremendously.
I do feel that the student should have to start paying back the loans that they accumulate within six months of graduating, but they should have the option of how long they want to take to pay it back. This would kind of be like a mortgage 15- 30 years or less and obviously the intrest would also be similar. I don&apos;t feel that the student should not have to pay at all as they did take out the loan and go to the classes.

Students want to be guaranteed that they will have a job as soon as they graduate. The students that wants to graduate they will do anything to accomplish their goal. How can a student be successful if they don’t have enough money for their tuition? The only place they could turn to is banks, because they will need loans.

The way the interested rate of loans keeps going up most students won’t want to take loans. They want to know how they are going to pay that money back and how soon.

At least if they knew that as soon as they graduate they will have a job on the spot and they could start paying right away. The government should at least helps us more with tuition like increasing our financial aids money to help us more with school materials.

In the United States today it is not guaranteed that college graduates will have a full time job upon completion of their college degree. I believe the problem starts with the students not the job market. The job market is a constantly changing system of demands. One year their could be a high demand for let&apos;s say bio-mechanical engineers and in a couple of years that demand shifts to information technology technicians. Therefore, students upon deliberating what field of study to choose should first take a meticulous look at the job market and match up their field of study to the spectrum of jobs in-demand. Now with more students employed in a certain company that company is now making more revenue which leads them to having more money in order to hire more employees.
There is another issue college graduates have to face on top of finding a job and that is paying off the debt from student loans used to acquire their education. Most students have to work full-time in order to attend school and to sustain themselves. These students should come up with a monthly payment system, which they set the amount to pay. This allows the student to pick off little by little from their student loans so they do not have a huge sum to pay off once they&apos;ve graduated. Students should start this system the moment the pick up a loan till the day they graduate. Then once they have a job the student can pay the rest of the sum off and be debt free

Most people of all ages that have graduated from college have student loans. They range in different amounts due to economical standings and what type of educations was achieved, since becoming a doctor leaves a lot more debt then becoming an associate accountant. To help fix the problem of student loan debt more jobs need to be created in order to pay back loans quicker or wage needs to be raised. No person should have to worry about paying off debt so in order to make the pay pack of loans go smoother loan rates should be lower and jobs to help pay back the loans should be created.
Jobs of all kind around but the problem is that minimum wage is so low that nobody can live off it or even think about paying off school loans. If minimum wage was raised to a reasonable amount where paying for life was at an easier spot and loans could be paid back. Right now minimum wage is so low that even if a person worked 40 hrs a week they would still be below the poverty line making it impossible to live without stress and pay back loans. Which then if loans aren’t paid back interest collects leading to an impossible amount to ever pay off.
So in order to create more jobs minimum wage needs to be higher so nobody has to have 3 jobs and every one can have one job that will cover all expenses and help make paying back loans easier. Along with fixing minimum wage to help having a lower interest rate will also help to make paying pack loans easier. For if someone did get a little behind then they may end up in a hole of debt like many are today and never be able to get out of it.
In order to be able to help lower college debt loan rates need to be lowered to a manageable interest that can still be paid off in a reasonable amount of time. Along with the minimum wage needs to be brought up to a amount that does not leave a full time worker getting minimum wage at the poverty level. So in theory in min wage is raised and rates are cut back loans should be able to be paid off in 25-30 years depending on the pay plan and about of loan debt.
