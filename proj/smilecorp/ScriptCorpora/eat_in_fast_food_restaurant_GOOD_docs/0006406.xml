AMERICAN EXPRESS ANNOUNCES ARBY&apos;S®WILL ACCEPT EXPRESSPAY FOR CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS

Fast Food Restaurant Makes Dining In-Store and in the Drive-Thru Fast and Convenient

NEW YORK, May 01, 2006 -- American Express today announced Arby&apos;s Restaurant Group, Inc. is the latest national merchant partner to accept ExpressPay from American Express. Arby&apos;s plans to accept ExpressPay in-store and in the drive-thrus of its U.S. company-owned restaurants in the third quarter of 2006.

“We are constantly striving to provide our customers with high quality, fresh menu offerings quickly and conveniently,”said Don Zimmerman, senior vice president and chief information officer for Arby&apos;s Restaurant Group, Inc.“The ExpressPay technology allows us to do just that by making the check-out process fast and easy.”

ExpressPay from American Express is a contactless payment option that consists of a secure computer chip powered by radio frequency technology. The feature is an easy-to-use alternative to cash for making everyday purchases at merchants where speed and convenience are important–such as quick service restaurants, supermarkets, drug stores and gas stations.

American Express was the first issuer to launch contactless cards nationally with the rollout of Blue from American Express®with the ExpressPay feature in June 2005. ExpressPay is also embedded in the Clear from American Express(SM) Card and available via a key fob that can be linked to any American Express®Card. Users simply hold the Card or key fob with ExpressPay next to a special reader near the register to complete a purchase.

Payment is authorized in seconds and no signature is required for most purchases. The computer chip enables end-to-end transaction security. Blue and Clear from American Express Cards also have a magnetic strip and function as traditional credit cards.

“We are delighted to announce Arby&apos;s as our latest national partner in the quick service category,”said David Bonalle, vice president of Advanced Payments at American Express.&quot;The momentum of this emerging payment technology is growing rapidly as more merchants and consumers experience the benefits first-hand.&quot;

American Express has been working with contactless payments since 2002. The company&apos;s initial pilots showed that, on average, ExpressPay transactions are 63 percent faster than using cash. Market research with pilot participants also confirmed that consumers view convenience and simplicity of use as two of the major benefits. For merchants, important benefits include reduced transaction and service time for customers on the go. Also, the ExpressPay reader uses the merchants&apos; existing network infrastructure, so the system can be simply installed without lengthy or costly upgrades.

American Express continues to sign national and regional contactless payment merchants. For a full list of merchants now accepting ExpressPay visit, www.americanexpress.com/expresspay.
