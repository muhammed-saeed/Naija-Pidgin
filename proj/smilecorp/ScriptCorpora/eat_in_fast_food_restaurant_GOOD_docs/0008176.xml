During our last trip to New Orleans, we discovered Drago&apos;s Seafood Restaurant in Metairie, LA. There seafood is excellent, but their raw oysters and&quot;CharBroiled Oysters&quot;are off the planet good. We ate there 3 times during this trip and loved it each time. Nice atmosphere and friendlly service too.

I never lived in New Orleans, but I&apos;ve eaten in more than a hundred restaurants here. Some of my most memorable&quot;eating&quot;experiences drift into my mind when I think of the Big Easy. No one survives here who is not an exceptional preparer and presenter of food.

Had to try the CharGrilled Oysters and they were the best ever!! 3 of us had Stuffed Lobster and ate every bite and 1 had the special for the night, Blackened Redfish. We all loved our dinner. We almost missed going as theie websight said they were closed July 2 through the 6th. Luckily we called and they were open.

Wonderful Food!! Loved the char-grilled oysters and lobsters are fabulous. Tables are a little too close together but still great atmosphere

The broiled oysters were so good the went way too fast, so we followed them up with a dozen raw. Very good with Abita Strawberry Harvest beer.
The soft shell crab stuffed with crab and sitting in a lovely creamy shrimp sauce was outstanding.
Parking can be an issue and there are no reservations.
Travel here and have a wonderful... More

Charbroiled Oysters - EXCELLENT. This is what they are known for
Charbroiled Lobsters - not so excellent.
SHRIMP ‘N PASTA FLORENTINE: Fresh jumbo shrimp, sautéed with sun-dried tomatoes, fresh spinach, and onions in a cognac sauce. (HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF IN THE MOOD FOR PASTA)

I love this seafood restaurant! It deserves to be #1 in Metairie, Louisiana and I can&apos;t recommend a better place to get charbroiled oysters. My party of 3 ordered 2 dozen of them and it still wasn&apos;t enough! That&apos;s how good they are. We also ordered the florentine pasta (the sauce is so good!) and charbroiled lobster, but this was... More
