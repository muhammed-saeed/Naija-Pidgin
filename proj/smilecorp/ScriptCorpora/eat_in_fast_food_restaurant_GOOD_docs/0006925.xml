 Lose weight the right way - the healthy way! - by following a clinically
 proven diet plan. And learn how to keep it off - for good!

 Just Tell Me What to Eat: The Dr. Gourmet Diet Plan is
 an easy-to-follow diet for real people who live in the real world. So what
 does that really mean?

 Create a two-week custom meal plan including breakfast, lunch and dinner,
 for yourself or your entire family - even kids under 14! NO making
 separate meals.

 Shopping lists are automatically generated. Just print and shop for
 the next two weeks of meals.

 Frozen meal options for lunch or dinner (such as Lean Cuisine or Weight
 Watchers).

 Easy, kid-friendly meals with leftovers for lunches or later in the
 week.

 Special diet options include Comfort Food (great for families with
 kids!), Vegetarian (lacto-ovo), low sodium, lactose intolerant, Coumadin
 (warfarin) use, GERD / Acid Reflux safe, and gluten allergies (celiac
 disease). All meal plans are safe for type 2 diabetics because they are
 based on the Mediterranean Diet, which is known to be the best diet for
 type 2 diabetics. Combine special needs if needed: low sodium and lactose
 intolerant? Coumadin and celiac disease? Just select the options and
 get your delicious meal plan!

Other websites charge you as much as $29.95 per month for this service, but Just Tell Me What to Eat: The Dr. Gourmet Diet Plan is completely free. (We
 don&apos;t even ask for your credit card information.)

Eating Healthier at Fast Food Restaurants : Baja Fresh

 I have created this list of selected items for you to use when you must eat out. The items listed fall generally under 400 calories or so under 15 grams of fat and under 600 milligrams of sodium. If you are going to be stuck eating at such restaurants, this is a fairly good guideline for the healthiest options on the menu. I&apos;ve also included a printable version so that you can print it out and take it with you for reference.
