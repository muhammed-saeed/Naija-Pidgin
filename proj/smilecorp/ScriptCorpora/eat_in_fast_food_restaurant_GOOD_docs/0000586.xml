This is the original Del Taco! We were drawn in by the advertisements on the Highway Stations, and I&apos;m glad we stopped.

Five stars for the Barstow Tostada! The actual white corn tostada shell is so thin and crispy--I&apos;m still thinking about it over a month later!

Don&apos;t forget to order a scoop of ice cream! The single scoops are huge for the price.

this del taco is THE ULTIMATE PIT STOP FOR BATHROOM BREAKS AND YUMMY SNACKS BEFORE/AFTER GOING OR COMING BACK FROM VEGAS TO CALI!  seriously i stop here EVERY time i go to vegas.  their tacos are WAY BIGGER then your average sized del taco taco.  plus its more money.. so you get what you pay for and arent gipped with the meat.

big bathrooms
good snacking.
great place to stop.

Everything is quite a bit better at this Del Taco than at any other.  (Del Taco corporate muckety mucks take note- make all your stores like this one!)  Bigger, cleaner, happy to serve you staff and a bit of nostalgia dropped in.  I met the founder of Del Taco there as he was helping to bus tables and perform his duties as the nicest host and greeter of all time!

Well done Ed!

I lived in Granada Hills for several years, and I lived very close to a Del Taco. I tried it maybe once or twice but I wasn&apos;t a fan.

Fast forward several years and I meet my current girlfriend, who has  got an unusual crush on Del Taco. So slowly I get into it myself, regretting that I didn&apos;t give the Granada Hills location another chance. One thing I&apos;ve noticed about this chain though, is that their consistency is off, items taste different from location to location, anyways I digress. (I think I may have ADHD, you may have noticed by reading some other reviews of mine.)

My friend Eric knows that I like Del Taco and would always tell me that I NEED to try this particular Del Taco. So on our way back from Vegas, my gf and I thought, why not! As we parked and walked in, nothing looked extremely different, except for that every table has it&apos;s own sauce caddy. YES!!! We were very hungry but for some reason we just simply decided on having one burrito each (we can put some Del Taco away!). We went with the spicy chicken burrito (add sour cream). When we got our burritos (they bring them to your table btw!), first thing we noticed is; DAMN these are big burritos! Much MUCH bigger than any burrito I&apos;ve ever gotten from any other Del Taco. The presentation was nice too, it was wrapped around the packaging, but rather just sitting on it.

On to the taste, it was (compared to other Del Tacos) AMAZING! I mean it was ridiculously better! How can this place call itself Del Taco, when it&apos;s leaps-and-bounds better than the others? It&apos;s a discredit to itself! I loved the burrito, and I&apos;m not a huge fan of burritos in general. I just think most burritos are mostly tortilla, not this one though.

The service was really good too, the people working there genuinely looked and acted friendly. The girl behind the counter was happy to tell us that this was the first Del Taco. I think I read somewhere that the original Del Taco owner actually owns this one, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised. He obviously takes pride in his restaurant.

If you&apos;re at all a fan of Del Taco (hell, even if you&apos;re not!), stop in! You won&apos;t regret it!

I thought I already loved Del Taco with a shameless fervor. Then we stopped here on our way to Vegas, and dear lord, what is to become of us...?

The second ever location, and they have the actual Classic taco from the old school menu. It&apos;s a huge meaty monstrosity stuffed with fresh grated cheddar and lettuce and topped with a fat blushing slice of steak tomato. I swear the ground beef is different - they must cook it fresh to order. While I don&apos;t usually apply &apos;Bigger is Better&apos; to most things in life, it is definitely true in the case of this menu.

Curse you, original Del Taco. At the other locations I could order a 99cent red burrito and a classic taco and eat both with gusto. Now there is only room for one or the other. A dilemma which usually ends in ordering both and regretfully bringing one home, only to later be eaten by the fiancé on the sly. DRAT!

Since I was a child I have been visiting this Del Taco, and ever since I was a child the taste and quality has not changed one bit. Best Del Taco I have ever had, ever (and I consider myself to be somewhat of a Del Taco connoisseur).  I look forward to driving to California specifically for this Del Taco. It is a crime against your taste buds if you miss it!!

Food was DELICIOUS! The ground beef has a very delicious homemade taste, and they stuff the meat and give generous portions of their Delicious cheese! Everything is twice as large here, yet the prices are Fair they&apos;ve remained the same.

Also the Staff is extra Friendly here::surprisingly::

This is a Must Stop: before or after Vegas! :P

BEST del taco ever!!! You order a normal hard taco, and open it to find 1) it&apos;s not half empty 2) you can actually see real onions diced into the beef 3) the taco is topped with a tomato 4) the taco is spilling more things onto the wrapper than is already in the taco!!!

They also leave a giant basket of hot sauce at every table so you don&apos;t have to deal with people who don&apos;t understand you need for flavor or spice!

Also, all four barstow locations (and I think the Yermo location?) are the founding locations and therefore share menu items that you can&apos;t get elsewhere. This time It was a Tostada, but I&apos;m pretty sure last year they also had Tortas.

Not at all a waste of money, and a worthwhile stop for Del Taco lovers!!! (I I know you are out there - Igotodeltacoat2amwithclosefriends person!!!! )

Still the best Del Taco ever.
I was driving to AZ last week and decided to go thru Barstow to the 40 just so I could stop at this Del Taco for lunch (is that sick or what!?).
Totally worth it!

There are no 39 cent tacos at this place. In fact they don&apos;t even have 59 cent tacos. They are more like $1.50 a pop!
Sounds crazy for Del Taco, but I can tell you that more stuff FELL OUT of my taco than normally comes IN a 39 cent taco at other Del Tacos! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

If you are a fan of Del Taco, definitely worth a stop on your next trip to Vegas or AZ.

Wow!!!!! Really the best Del Taco I&apos;ve ever been to! We ordered....2 hard tacos, 2 chicken soft tacos, quesadilla, medium coke and regular nachos.
Unwrapped the tacos :-O
HUGE....tons of meat, lettuce, cheese and a round slice of tomato right on top! Soft taco...equally delicious. We didn&apos;t even notice a price variation...we yelped del taco cause we had missed the one off the Main St....SCORE.....cause my hubby missed the exit. The quality is unbelievable and the hype is real. I didn&apos;t read the reviews until after we ate there....then I read all of them. If I hadn&apos;t had the need to write this review I would&apos;ve never know. Definitely stopping on our next Vegas trip.

When I was a kid, fast food wasn&apos;t a weekly dinner option...it was more like a monthly treat. After maybe a long day of yardwork, my dad would announce that we were gonna have Del Taco...man did it make us happy! My mom would take our order and drive down and get it for to-go. Us kids couldn&apos;t wait for her to get back!

Fast-forward a few years: Most Del Taco&apos;s have the Taco Tuesday with 3 anorexic, tomato-less little dudes for a buck, no flagship Bun Taco or Tostada. No more brown and orange sun logo or orange taco wrapper. Not to mention that people eat fast-food so much that it seems to have become a FOOD GROUP!

The Del Taco in Barstow/Lenwood is a jewel in the desert...the last of its kind. They have the old-school food that I remember. Tacos are big, complete with the slice of tomato and orange wrapper...they have tostadas served on a little cardboard tray. Of course, the crinkle cut fries. They even still have the bun taco and combo-cup, for chrissakes! Anytime I go to Vegas, I stop here on the way in and the way out. The food really brings back the old memories...makes me wanna break out my OP corduroy shorts and rip wallet.

Let&apos;s bring back fast-food as a treat and not a God-given, cheap, and all-too-easy right. Then maybe all Del Taco&apos;s will step up and serve this kind of fare...then again, maybe not...I&apos;d probably eat it too much.

Best taco ever? You gotta be kidding me. I must be a taco snob or just plain spoiled by the abundance of delicious fast food in the Mission District of San Francisco.

We stopped here because we still had a lot of driving to do to Flagstaff, AZ.

Normally, when I MUST eat fast food, In-N-Out Burger is the place to go. But, the raving reviews on Yelp deterred me from my usual road dining stop. Del Taco in Barstow is supposed to be the Bomb. It is. But, the bad kind of bomb that blows up a good road trip.

What I found to be a real deal breaker was that my chicken tasted weird. I decided against eating it because food poisoning and road trip definitely doesn&apos;t mix.

Overall: The service is friendly. I&apos;ve tasted better food at Taco Bell. I think that says it all.

Believe the hype people... this place is no joke! This is how Del Taco is supposed to taste. You wanna know why? Because not only does Ed Hackbarth (the founder of Del Taco) own it, he actually WORKS HERE! This place is his baby and he&apos;s only gonna give you love and quality. He is an awesome guy who loves to mingle and take pictures with everyone. You can probably catch him here on a weekday.

The menu is the same as any other Del Taco chain, but it just tastes better. They have a signature taco you can&apos;t find at any other Del Taco. It&apos;s a little bigger than your average sized taco with a lot more meat, cheese and a slice of tomato on top! The quesadillas have a much more restaurant quality as well. The place is set up like a mini restaurant and they bring the food to your table. Fast and friendly service is always good.

This is one of my MANDATORY stops on the way to Vegas from LA. And if you are ever traveling along the 15 freeway, you better exit of Lenwood and make it one of your stops too.

I hope all the other Del Tacos hear about this place and get the hint!

A drive to Vegas isn&apos;t complete if I don&apos;t stop off this Del Taco to take a piss and to grab a snack. This is probably the roomiest Del Taco I&apos;ve ever  been to, which makes sense since they do get a lot of traffic from Vegas bound travelers. It&apos;s ALWAYS packed! Clean place though, and the service is quick...

I always get my spicy chicken burrito combo or a cheese quesadilla. This is my last power meal that gets me through the last leg of my drive until I get to Sin City. Big cheers for Del Taco!

The 5-Star Del Taco!! Great tacos&amp;bean burritos. Excellent service: they actually bring your food out.  Everyone is friendly and happy.  It&apos;s by far the best Del Taco I&apos;ve ever been to and amongst the top quick-service restaurants I&apos;ve been to.

It&apos;s larger than most Dels and cleaner, too.  We drove through on the way to Vegas from LA and were amazed by the abundant, fresh cheese and tasty chicken.  Thinking it was an anomaly, we decided to stop in on the way back to LA and we were pleasantly surprised to find the same excellent food!  The latter time, we ate in the dining room and noticed there was napkins on the tables, along with salsa packs and other things--so no need to get up if you run out!  Also, they brought your food to you, Carl&apos;s Jr-style.

We&apos;ll be sure to make this a regular stop anytime we do this drive from now on.  5-stars for being the best in this category.

As one who grew up on Del Taco (and Naugles), I was kind of excited to visit the very first Del Taco and I have to say, my new favorite DT.

As soon as I walked in and saw a &quot;Combo Cup&quot; on the menu, I knew I was home.  None of the DTs around my area have it on the menu, although a few will still serve it if you ask.  The only downside is, no kids menu here.

While the food tasted pretty much the same as other Del Taco&apos;s, the portions were so much bigger!  The taco was filled with meat almost to the top of the shell, with the tomato and lettuce pretty much spilling out.

The place also seemed much cleaner, the staff friendlier and I just love the baskets of taco sauce, including the great Del Scorcho, on the table. Well done Del Taco!

I&apos;ve eaten ALOT of del taco in my days, and i must say that i honestly didnt taste the difference, the portions were a little bigger and i did like that they grilled the soft tortillas to a crisp, but it still tasted like normal del taco??

I tried the carnitas taco, since this is the only del taco that makes it, and it was not good, no flavor to the meat at all.

The service was good, vey nice and friendly, when most del taco&apos;s could care less! I will defiantely be back when i need a del shesh on my way back from a weekend trip!

I&apos;m surprised this Del Taco doesn&apos;t have like 200 reviews. True it&apos;s a Del Taco but it&apos;s a 5 star one. Everything is bigger, hotter and better than expected. If your like my partner that&apos;s orders drive-thru on a roadtrip like it&apos;s a last meal you can definitely skip one item or two at this location! A Macho order of fries here is completely ridiculous, I mean that in a good way of course.

My favorite Barstow menu item is the Bun Taco. He likes the slice of tomato that they still put on regular tacos here.

OK, so I heard this is supposed to be the real deal.  Where the original creator of Del taco still works and prides himself in these amazing tacos.  So I dont know why, but I was expecting something special, something homemade.  I&apos;m pretty stupid for thinking that and creating unrealistic expectations from a fast food joint.  here&apos;s how my experience went.

The outside looks normal, but when you go inside you notice a difference.  Huge dining area, clean and.... TACO SAUCE, AT THE TABLES!  Crazy!  They were carefully packed and neatly organized as well.  It&apos;s nice to walk into a fast food joint where you know the owners... care.  Pretty reminiscent of another fast food joint we all loved called In N Out.

So we got in and the menu was pretty standard as far as I could tell.  I ordered a macho burrito and macho fries.  I felt macho that day, what can I say?  I was ready for Vegas.

ANYWAY, the food came and initially I was pretty disappointed.  But upon careful inspection, I did notice a few things.  Burrito was better wrapped and there was just more meat as opposed to beans and lettuce at other Del Taco joints.

All in all, this was better than any Del Taco I&apos;ve been to before.  However, don&apos;t forget that it&apos;s still a fast food joint at the end of the day.

My favorite fast food restaurant by far, but this one is incredible!! When my ears are ringing and plugged from my climb to 4000ft, I shout into the drive-thru speaker. The next window, I pay, and here it is, my freshly made, piping hot fries, melty cheese on whichever I get, and plenty of napkins for the rest of my trip. It seems as if the food made here goes straight to the commercials

OH, and..... The burger here, which I got for the first time on my last trip, beats any in-n-out and/or fatburger I have tasted!

Make the stop!

My favorite Del Taco on the planet!!! This is a mandatory stop on all trips to Vegas. The bathrooms are large and clean, which is great because this is the point on the trip where the Starbucks latte purchased in Valencia is fighting to get out of my bladder. Also, this location has old school menu items like the big del burrito, tostadas, and bun tacos.

The Vegas party starts here! I &quot;heart&quot; the Barstow Del Taco!

This is simply the best Del Taco ever. It has to be as it is the originator of all the del taco&apos;s so they have a reputation to uphold. These are the 3 reasons why this is by far the BEST del taco.

1. Price-ok well you might have to pay an extra 50 cents but don&apos;t be a cheap skate. It&apos;s worth it.

2. Quantity-the portions are way bigger than a regular del taco. This means that you&apos;ll save more cause you don&apos;t have to buy as much.

3. Quality-everything, from shell, meat, cheese, vegetables, presentation is just better.

Overall if i had to compare this del taco, i would say it&apos;s equivalent to medium end restaurant food. It&apos;s that good! Believe me try the standard taco, burrito and fries. You will NOT be dissappointed.

A &apos;must-stop&apos; on your way to Vegas or on your way back to L.A.!!!

If you are on your way to Vegas, this place will fill your hunger, since they are extremely generous with the portions - much more than your local Del Taco.    Hence, you will be satisfied and continue to trek on to Vegas without stopping any further.

If you are on your way back from Vegas, and are pretty much broke and ravenous,  then this is the place to go to.    Also a great place to &apos;unload&apos; your buffet that you ate the other day in Vegas since the restrooms accommodate many stalls.

*** my favorite:   Hard shelled taco.   Meat is filled up superfluously halfway up the shell and there is mad shredded cheese w/ tomato on top!      The best bang for your buck One Dollar taco around!

Ask anybody who knows about this Del Taco and they&apos;ll tell you, &quot;I have to make a stop in Lenwood to go to Del Taco&quot;!  It&apos;s something we look forward to, every time we know we&apos;re going to Las Vegas.  Sounds silly, I know, but the food here is the best!  Overload of meat and other toppings!  I&apos;m getting excited just talking about it!  They put a slice of tomato on their crunchy tacos too!  The hot sauces are neatly placed in baskets on the tables, which is great for me because I always use so much!  They also have the bun taco aka taco burger.  We bought one for my brother and he ended up buying another one.  My favorite is the crunchy chicken taco.  Trust me, you don&apos;t have to order as much food as you order back at home...order less.  A big thanks to Aaron and Sean for telling us to go here!  Hooked! P.S.  They have ice cream too...a scoop of strawberry on a cone please!

Cool, I&apos;m no. 10 to review this place. Woohoo!!

So, nothing else can be said about eating at Del Taco in Barstow or for that matter at any other Del Taco in the whole of the Del Taco universe. But here is my two cents.

Tacos here are slightly larger than other Del Taco&apos;s I&apos;ve been to. I think they actually stuff them more here. The great thing about this place, is that the menu appears to have more choices than others I&apos;ve been to before. The service is exceptionally fast and what more could you ask for to have your Del Scorcho, mild sauce, and ketchup sitting at your table waiting for you. I mean before I was barely sitting for one minute, the food was already on the way over to our table. How cool is that?! The seating in this place is plentiful. This place was hopping, but we were able to find a place to sit with no problem.

The only thing I have to say against this place is that they should move the forks and other utensils near the straws by the soda fountain. Otherwise, you&apos;re going from one side of restaurant to the other and having to navigate your way through the ordering line (that&apos;s no fun).

Other than that, this is a quick and easy place to come to while you&apos;re on the road to whatever your destination happens to be.

If you do that 4 hour drive to Vegas you must make a pit stop at the Del Taco in Barstow.

If you are a fan of DT you will appreciate the larger portions, better quality and friendly staff than at most Del Taco&apos;s.

Just get a taco and all will be realized!

I give it 4 stars because I grew up in Barstow, went to High School in Barstow, and, yeah, got the hell out of Barstow.

But I&apos;m nostalgic. What happened to the Del on 1st street? That was the very first Del Taco in the world. One of Barstow&apos;s few claims to fame. The other is that Darva Conger went to my high school.

Anyway, Del Taco was the place to go for fast food. Good, fresh, cheap, greasy. Interestingly, that make a mean hamburger.

Go Spartans! Go Riffians! Go Aztecs!

Remember, I&apos;m only giving it 4 stars because I grew up eating Del Taco and I haven&apos;t eaten their food in 25 years.

An ORIGINAL Del Taco?  I didn&apos;t know these existed until my co-worker told me about em.

After a fun-filled Las Vegas trip we decided to stop by this place on the way back to LA.  I&apos;ve always been a fan of Del Taco since college, so I really didn&apos;t see how this could be any better than any other time I&apos;ve gone.  Boy was I wrong.

As everyone has said, everything here is bigger than regular Del Taco places.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla and 2 chicken soft tacos.  The soft tacos were a little more expensive ($1.69) than usual, but yes they were bigger and even tastier than the normal tacos that I&apos;m used to.  My favorite were the baskets of hot sauce on each table.  *See picture.*

You probably will feel like crap after eating here, but screw it.  Since when does anyone ever come back from Vegas feeling fine and dandy?  :]

A temporary detour on the way to Las Vegas meant that on a recent trip, my route bypassed this exit, to my surprise. This meant no option to eat at Del Taco, which is a shame because it would have been a good lunch.  Any other Del Taco i&apos;ve been to is a two or one star establishment.  I&apos;m not much for the imaginary Mexican food style, and I don&apos;t have the memories associated with Del Taco that I have with Taco Bell, which I ate almost daily for several months at UC Davis.

Having said that, this is a very special Del Taco.  It has all sorts of items not found or discontinued from other Del Tacos and nearly every item is a much better version of those had elsewhere.  Usually this means you&apos;re paying an extra $0.50, but it&apos;s worth it.  It&apos;s worth it just for the perception-bending experience of walking into a Del Taco that looks like any other Del Taco, but everything is twice as good.  I wish more junky fast food places had undercover super-locations like this.  Like maybe an Arby&apos;s that tasted like Phillipe&apos;s.

Best Del Taco on earth. Maybe the best food on earth. The original Del. Amazing. Stop here every trip (well, almost every trip) to socal. You&apos;ll want to drive to Barstow just to eat here again (haha, maybe not) Off Lenwood exit (just south of Barstow) east side of 15. Seriously good food.  Make sure you&apos;re hungry, because you wont want to stop eating. Makes me feel sad for the rest of the Del Tacos. Place is older but very clean and each table is stocked with napkins and sauce. Parking is good, easy enough to get an RV in and out. Theres also a Flying J at this exit.

I always thought In and Out was the place to stop during the trip to vegas, but I might have to switch it up. my soft tacos were huge, like if you normally order two, try ordering just one here.

Blast to the past for the original style Del Taco at this location.

This is the ONLY Del Taco that I know of that makes the food like they used to when they first opened.  Tacos with LOTS of ingredients stuffed in them and you can even get the bun taco that no other Del Taco has anymore.....which is taco meat on a bun with lots of lettuce, cheese and tomato.  There is a basket packed full of ketchup and a variety of hot sauces on every single table.  This place is always clean and the people that work there are always friendly....five stars for a fast food place on this one.

Chili cheese fries&amp;chicken taco. Yum!  Stopped on the way home from Vegas.  Clean, spacious&amp;quick service!  I usually don&apos;t eat at these type of places, but it can be a treat time to time.

Wait. What&apos;s the difference between this Del Taco and all the others? There&apos;s nothing special here. The only difference is they bring your food to you. Service is good and really fast, but other than that.. It&apos;s just Del Taco. Sorry guys, I was bummed too. Oh, but there is pretty good ice cream. Want a disappointment? Go out of your way to this place..
