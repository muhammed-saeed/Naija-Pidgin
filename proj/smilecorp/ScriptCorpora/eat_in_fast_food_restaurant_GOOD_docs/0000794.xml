 Week 12: Maintenance; Long-Term Wellness 

Here are some simple strategies for enjoying a healthy, active lifestyle outdoors.
 1. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER 
When it comes to physical activity, don’t forget the importance of water. You’ve probably heard this a
hundred times, but there’s a reason for it. Your body uses water in almost every function, including the
process of burning fat. Water helps every cell and organ in your body work. It cushions your joints, and
helps keep your body cool. Water also helps flush toxins out of your system and rehydrates the body. Plan
ahead. Make sure to carry a water bottle and hydrate with water or a fitness drink. Drink before, during
and after physical activity to replace the water you lose when you sweat. Even a small water deficiency
can affect how you perform, so drink up!

 2. TRACK YOUR PROGRESS 

Keep a journal of your physical activity to chart your progress. Whether you’re interested in losing weight,
building muscle or just getting active again, keeping a log will help motivate you. Record all the information
for each workout, including time, intensity and performance. It’s a good idea to record your baseline
measurements and find out your body-fat percentage, so you can set attainable weight-loss goals. You
may not feel like you’re making progress, but when you look back at where you started, you may be
pleasantly surprised. Remember that small steps matter. Tracking even a slight amount of improvement
on paper will inspire you to keep going with confidence.

 3. PROTECT YOUR SKIN AND HAIR 

Do you play sports or spend time working out at the beach? Being outdoors means being exposed to the
elements, such as sun, wind and pollution. For example, it’s a good idea to wear sunscreen and a hat to
protect your skin and hair. Use products that help repair damage from daily environmental stresses and
that can help protect your skin and hair from the elements. For example, Herbalife’s NouriFusion® skincare
line is great for daily cleansing, toning and moisturizing, while Herbalife’s Skin Activator® anti-aging skincare
helps protect and correct the signs of aging.

 TIPS FOR STAYING ACTIVE 

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

Chances are you or someone you know is resolving to lose weight or get in shape. Part of what makes
these such difficult resolutions is that we expect to see results quickly, and when we don’t, we tend to give
up. Getting in shape and becoming healthier isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon (but without all the sweating and
fatigue of an actual marathon). Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and eating the right foods are
lifelong activities. Here are some ideas to help you make living fit a part of your life:

 1. GET SPECIFIC 

The more detail you include in your plan, the better your chances of success. If you’ve decided to simply
“exercise” and “eat better,” you might not have the success you’d hoped. That’s because “exercise” isn’t
a specific plan. Set aside 25 minutes each morning, say between 6:45 and 7:10, to stretch, walk or jog
around the block–whatever. Just be specific. To eat better, schedule specific healthy meals and snacks
for specific times throughout the day.

 2. MAKE IT ROUTINE 

One effective way to introduce a new behavior is to make it part of your day. For exercise, set up a routine–
maybe a walk around your neighborhood each morning. If you’ve resolved to lose weight, replace lunch
with a healthy protein shake every day. The key is to establish a routine of things you do at specific times.
The sooner it becomes part of your day, the sooner it will become part of your life.

 3. CELEBRATE YOUR SUCCESSES 

If you create specific plans for exercise and healthier eating, and you make them part of your daily routine,
chances are you’ll be seeing positive results. Celebrate! You’ve earned it. Treat yourself to something
you’ve been wanting to do–instead of splurging on unhealthy foods. And a reward, like taking yourself out
to a movie or pampering yourself with a trip to a spa, is a great motivator to keep the good results coming.

 KEEP FITNESS ON TRACK 

 Since restaurant portions are usually large, ask the server to put half your meal in a “doggie bag”
before it’s served to you. That way, you’ll eat less, but still have the satisfaction of cleaning your plate.
 If after-dinner snacking is a problem for you, try brushing your teeth after dinner. It works as a great
signal to stop eating.
 If your entrée at a restaurant is served with the typical “starch and vegetable,” ask to omit the
starch and double the vegetables instead. Vegetable side dishes are usually small, so this will help
to increase your day’s intake.
 Afternoon snacking is a tough time for people–but there often is a long stretch between lunch and
dinner, and so snacking may be appropriate. Use this time to have a “second lunch”, and have
something a little more substantial like an Herbalife® Formula 1 shake, a cup of cottage cheese with
some fruit. Then do your cutting back at dinner time.
 Breakfast foods often include items that might be lacking the rest of the day–whole grains for fiber,
dairy products for calcium, and fruit. An Herbalife® Formula 1 shake (made with fruit) and a slice of
whole-grain toast helps to meet a lot of your nutritional needs and starts the day off right.
 Coffeehouse fanatics beware–some of those coffee drinks are low in nutrition and high in calories.
Try a nonfat latte, which provides a full serving of dairy and about 10 grams of protein, and couple
it with a piece of fresh fruit for a quick, nourishing breakfast.
 Add fruits to your salad for a change. Try fresh orange or tangerine sections, apples or kiwi. The
sweet fruits go well with tangy vinaigrette dressings. Use deep-green leafy vegetables, too–instead
of iceberg lettuce–for more nutrition.
 Frozen vegetables and fruits can be just as nutritious as fresh, may be less expensive, and allow
you to eat foods that might not be in season that time of the year. For example, loose-leaf frozen
spinach or chopped vegetables can easily be added to soups and stews.
 Try not to rely on fats, sugar and salt to flavor foods. Instead, try grated lemon, lime or orange zest on
fruits, vegetables, fish or chicken, and experiment with herbs, spices, onions and garlic in your dishes.
 Calories in cold beverages like sodas, juices and juice drinks can add up fast. Instead, try sparkling
mineral water with a slice of lemon or lime or a tiny splash of juice for flavor. Tomato or mixed
vegetable juices are filling, nutritious and low calorie.
 Find an exercise buddy to work out with and who will commit to a regimen with you. If you walk
together, for example, you and your buddy can take each other’s shoes home with you. You’ll be
obligated to show up for your next workout!
 Regular exercise will induce better sleep at night. You’ll get into deeper sleep stages more quickly,
so you feel more rested in the morning. You might even be able to sleep a little less, and use the
extra time to work out.
 Need more fiber? Load sandwiches up with lots of veggies, including lettuce, tomato, cucumber
and sprouts, and use 100 percent whole-grain bread.
 Make a hummus spread in the blender with garbanzo beans and a touch of olive oil, lemon juice,
salt, pepper and garlic and use as a sandwich filling or a replacement for mayonnaise.
 Try to balance animal protein with vegetarian protein sources. Formula 1 contains healthy soy
protein. Try marinating firm tofu slices in teriyaki sauce and then roasting in the oven. The tofu gets
dense and meaty, and is great tossed into a salad, as a sandwich filling in a whole-grain pita bread,
or as an entrée with brown rice and veggies.
 It’s true–using smaller plates will help you to control portions. Foods take up more room on smaller
plates and will make you think you have a larger portion than you actually do.
 Another portion control tip: No matter what you are eating, put it on a plate. Don’t sit down with a
bag of chips, a box of crackers or a can of mixed nuts–you’re bound to overeat. Determine ahead
of time what your portion is going to be, then put it on a plate or in a bowl.
 Current recommendations for exercise are that we should accumulate 30 minutes of activity per
day. Don’t have enough time? Break it up into two or three shorter sessions. Take a short walk at
lunch, one at break time and another one after dinner.
 For a change from canned tuna, try canned salmon. It’s wild–not farmed–and makes a nice change
for a sandwich. It makes a great burger, too: Mix flaked canned salmon with some minced onions
and peppers, some bread crumbs and egg whites, shape into patties and grill on both sides before
placing on a whole-grain bun.
 Boost the nutritional value of canned soups by mixing with nonfat milk or soy milk instead of water.
As the soup is heating, toss in some frozen mixed vegetables, or some loose-packed spinach to
add nutrition, flavor and bulk.
 Try mixing canned tuna with mashed avocado instead of mayonnaise for a tasty sandwich filling.
Avocado has less fat per tablespoon than mayo, and the fat it contains is heart healthy.
 You can reduce the fat in homemade baked goods by replacing half the fat in the recipe with
applesauce, plain yogurt or baby food peaches. Peaches match well with quick breads, and yogurt
and applesauce work well in spicy treats like coffeecakes.
 Make it a goal to try new healthy foods on a regular basis. Visit your local farmers’ or ethnic markets
to find new foods such as different fruits, vegetables or whole-grain products. Keeping your meals
healthy and interesting will keep you on track.
 Read nutrition labels carefully. All the nutrition and calorie information given is for one serving, not
one package. Beverage containers can have two to three servings; small bags of snack foods are
often several servings, too. That bag of pretzels you thought had 140 calories could have closer to 500.
 Stay hydrated throughout the day and pay particular attention to fluid intake after exercising. Weigh
yourself before and after a workout. For every pound of weight lost, drink two to three cups of
water to replace the fluids you lost during activity.
 Whole grains are important, but many side dishes require long cooking times. So, try foods that
take less time such as quick brown rice, quinoa or whole-wheat couscous.
 You can eat healthy even if you’re on the run. Try to steer away from the fast-food burgers and more
toward deli-style chains for healthier, lighter sandwiches and wraps, or Mexican-style grills for soft
tacos, fajitas and salads.
 Keeping a journal of your food intake and exercise is a great tool. Even better, try to pre-plan your
meals and exercise into your daily journal–you’ll feel more committed that way.
 Protein powders are great in protein shakes, but you can also add them to other foods. For a
high-protein breakfast alternative, cook rolled oats in nonfat milk or soy milk, and stir some
vanilla-flavored protein powder into the cooked cereal. The extra protein will provide staying
power all the way until lunch.
Sometimes we don’t realize that we have mixed feelings about making behavior changes. Take a few
minutes to think about and list the benefits and drawbacks of changing your nutritional habits and
losing weight.

Here are some examples:

 BENEFIT OF NOT MAKING CHANGES 

I can keep eating the way I want without having to work on making any changes in my life.

 BENEFIT OF MAKING CHANGES 

I won’t have to worry about the health risks of being inactive and eating poorly.

 DRAWBACK OF NOT MAKING CHANGES 

If I don’t make changes now, things might get worse.

 DRAWBACK OF MAKING CHANGES 

It might be hard for me to get support from my family and friends to do this. They’re
used to me the way I am.

Now rate each of your answers on a scale of 1 to 5:

1 = Not important
2 = Somewhat important
3 = Important
4 = Very important
5 = Extremely important
After doing this exercise, can you see why making a decision is an important factor in losing weight?

 
THE DECIDING FACTOR 

Most people associate the mineral calcium with healthy bones. And a lot of people also think that
adequate calcium intake is more of a concern for women than it is for men. While it’s true that the
primary function of calcium in the body is to maintain healthy bone structure, you may not know that
calcium performs many important functions for everybody. Calcium helps muscles contract, helps
blood to clot, helps the nervous system to function properly, and is important in maintaining healthy
blood pressure.
Many people do not take in the recommended intake of calcium from foods. Some people don’t like
dairy products, or think they are fattening, (Some products, like cheese, are high in calories and fat,
and certain yogurts are high in calories because of the sugar content.) Other people think “milk is for
kids.” And some people cannot tolerate the sugar in milk (called lactose) so they shy away from dairy
products. The good news is that calcium is found in other foods besides dairy products. But even so,
most people have a hard time meeting the recommendation of 1,000 mg for men and women up to
the age of 50, and 1,200 mg per day for people age 50 and up. This is where supplements can help
to meet your needs–not as a replacement for a poor diet, but as a way to supplement a nutritionally
well-balanced one.
This week’s challenge is for you to keep track of your calcium intake and see how it compares to the
recommendation. Look at the food and supplement sources in the chart on the next page. It lists
the amount of calcium per serving. Located after the chart is a log for you to record the foods and
drinks you consume that contain calcium. Pay attention to how much calcium you get compared
with how many calories the food has. Keep a list for three separate days, and add up your total
intake. If you fall short of the recommendation, see how you can increase your intake from foods and
supplements to meet your needs.

 Food Source Serving Size Calories Calcium per Serving 
Yogurt, plain, low-fat 1 cup 140 450 mg
Milk, nonfat or low-fat 1 cup 90-120 350 mg
Soy milk, plain, fortified 1 cup 100 300 mg

STATISTICS ON HEART DISEASE
Cardio Vascular Disease is the No 1 cause of death in America. Up to 1 million Americans
will die of CVD in 2002. According to statistics released by the American Heart Association
(AHA):

At least 58,800,000 million Americans (i.e. 1 person in 4) suffer from some form of
heart disease.

•50 million suffer from high blood pressure
•12 million suffer from coronary heart disease
•6.2 million suffer from angina pectoris
•7 million suffer from heart attack
•4.4 million suffer from stroke
•1.8 million suffer from rheumatic heart disease/fever
•1 million suffer from congenital cardiovascular defects
•4.6 million suffer from congestive heart failure
More American heart facts

•Of the 50 million Americans who have high blood pressure (the leading contributor to
heart disease) 35 percent don’t know they have it. High blood pressure is easily
detectable and usually controllable.
•Almost 1 out of every 2.4 deaths in the USA result from CVD.
•Since 1900, CVD has been the leading cause of death in every year but one–1918.
•About every 29 seconds an American will suffer a coronary event.
•About every 60 seconds, someone dies from one.
•At least 250,000 people die of heart attacks each year before they reach a hospital.
•Half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting help.
•CVD is the cause of more deaths than the next 7 causes of death put together.
•It is a myth that heart disease is a man’s disease. In fact, cardiovascular diseases are
the number one killer of women (and men). These diseases currently claim the lives
of more than a half a million females every year–more than the next 16 causes of
death put together.
•In 57 percent of men and 64 percent of women who died suddenly from CVD, there
were no previous symptoms of the disease.
•The cost of CVD in 1999 is estimated at $286.5 billion–an increase of about $12
billion from last year.
•Stroke killed 159,942 people in 1996.
•On average, someone in the US suffers a stroke every 53 seconds.
•On average, someone dies from stroke every 3 minutes 20 seconds.
Heart-Attacks and Strokes

A heart-attack occurs when we develop a blockage in one of the arteries supplying blood to
our heart. A stroke is the result of a blockage in one of the arteries to our brain. In either
case, the story is the same. Lack of blood stops the heart or brain from working so it shuts
down and we collapse.

How does an arterial-blockage occur?
It occurs as a result of a combination of things.

•Over time, the wall of our artery becomes diseased or corroded
•As our blood passes through this corroded section, it dumps some of the fat which it
is carrying, and this fat forms a bulge in the wall of the artery. Result? In the same

way that double-parking narrows a road and causes a slowdown in the flow of traffic,
this fatty bulge narrows the width of the artery and slows down the flow of blood as it
passes around it.

•If the blood flow gets too slow, and if tiny bits break off the bulge in the wall clogging
up the blood even more the blood will form a spontaneous clot, completely blocking
the artery.
Causes and Risk-factors Of Heart Attacks And Strokes

Things We Can’t Change

Certain factors increase the risk of a heart attack. Some can be changed, while others are
inherited. The major factors individuals can’t change include: age, gender and heredity.

Age

Four out of five deaths from the disease are in people over age 65. In this age group,
women are twice as likely to die from heart attacks as men.

Gender

•Women are more likely to die from heart disease than from all forms of cancer,
chronic lung disease, pneumonia, diabetes, accidents and AIDS combined.
•However, men have a greater life-long risk of heart attack, and experience attacks
earlier in life.
Heredity

You’re at greater risk if your parents had heart disease.

Things We Can Change

The major factors individuals can change include: smoking, high blood cholesterol levels,
high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity and being overweight.

Smoking

Smokers have twice as high a risk of heart attack as nonsmokers, and have two to four
times the risk of sudden cardiac death. Smokers are also more likely to die quickly and
suddenly than nonsmokers.

High blood pressure

African-Americans have the highest death rates from the disease. This may be due to their
higher rates of high blood pressure; about 1 in 3 black adults have high blood pressure,
compared to about 1 in 4 white adults. High blood pressure is also generally more severe
among elderly African-Americans than elderly whites, leading to more cases of strokes,
heart disease and kidney failure.

Cholesterol and cholesterol levels

•Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in all parts of your body. It helps make cell
membranes, some hormones, and vitamin D. Cholesterol comes from two sources: your
body and the foods you eat.

•Blood cholesterol is made in your liver. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body
needs.
•Dietary cholesterol comes from animal foods like meats, whole milk dairy foods, egg
yolks, poultry and fish.
•Eating too much dietary cholesterol can make your blood cholesterol go up. Foods
from plants, like vegetables, fruits, grains, and cereals, do not have any dietary
cholesterol.
The 2 types of cholesterol–(1) LDL (bad), (2) HDL (good)
•Like oil and water, cholesterol and blood do not mix. So, for cholesterol to travel through
your blood, it is coated with a layer of protein to make a“lipoprotein.”The two lipoproteins
are low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL).

•LDL-cholesterol carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. When too much LDL-
cholesterol is in the blood, it can lead to cholesterol buildup in the arteries. That is
why LDL-cholesterol is called the“bad”cholesterol.
•HDL-cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from the blood and helps prevent the fatty
buildup. This is why HDL-cholesterol is called the“good”cholesterol.
High cholesterol increases the risk of coronary heart disease. It makes the heart pump more
and faster, causing it to weaken. The risk is compounded with other factors, such as
smoking and high blood pressure. On the average, each of these doubles your chance of
developing heart disease. Therefore, a person who has all three risk factors is eight times
more likely to develop heart disease than someone who has none. Diabetes, obesity and
physical inactivity are other factors that can lead to coronary heart disease.

Things That Affect Blood Cholesterol

Your blood cholesterol level is influenced by many factors, including:

What you eat

High intake of saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, and excess calories leading to overweight
leads to increased blood cholesterol levels.

Warning!

It is now universally recognized that a diet which is high in fat, particularly saturated fat, and
low in complex carbohydrates, fruit and vegetables increases the risk of chronic diseases particularly
heart disease, stroke and cancer.

Overweight

Being overweight can make your LDL-cholesterol level go up and your HDL-cholesterol
level go down.

Exercise

Increased physical activity lowers LDL-cholesterol and raises HDL-cholesterol levels.

Heredity

Your genes partly influence how your body makes and handles cholesterol.

Age and Sex

Blood cholesterol levels in both men and women begin to go up around age 20. Women
before menopause have levels that are lower than men of the same age. After menopause,
a woman’s LDL-cholesterol level goes up–and so her risk for heart disease increases.

Exercise

Individuals who don’t exercise and/or are obese also put themselves at greater risk. Excess
weight strains the heart; influences blood pressure, blood cholesterol and tri-glyceride
levels; and increases the risk of diabetes.

Diabetes

Diabetes also increases the risk of heart disease. Heart disease kills more than 80% of
people with diabetes.

Stress

Stress may also contribute to the development of heart disease, because people may
overeat, exercise less or smoke more when they’re under stress.
WOMEN AND HEART DISEASE
Since 1984, heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases have killed more women
than men.

Women who snore regularly may increase their risk of heart attack or stroke by 33% notes a
researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health of Cambridge, Massachusetts. A
temporary shortage of oxygen during snoring can activate the sympathetic nervous system,
like heart rate and breathing, possibly leading to high blood pressure.

More than 1 out of 5 women have some form of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular
diseases kill more women than all forms of cancer, chronic lung disease, pneumonia,
diabetes, accidents and AIDS combined. In 64% of women who died suddenly of coronary
heart disease, there were no previous symptoms of this disease.

What is a heart-healthy diet?

A heart-healthy diet is a diet high in vitamin C, low in sodium, cholesterol, and fat. Foods
that best meet these requirements are whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. A diet high in
sodium, fat and cholesterol is associated with higher blood pressure, increased weight, and
elevated blood cholesterol levels, all of which increase the chances that atherosclerosis will
occur.

Bad News about heart disease

•Individuals suffering from heart disease are at risk of having a stroke.
•Menopause increases a woman’s risk for heart disease.
•When a woman has a heart attack, she has a poorer chance of survival than a man
does. The poorer chance of survival is largely because women usually have vague
symptoms that can result in delayed care.
•Heart disease kills more women each year than all forms of cancer, chronic lung
disease, pneumonia, diabetes, accidents and AIDS combined.
•Individuals who suffer from depression are three to four times more likely to die of
cardiac causes than individuals who do not suffer from depression.
•Heart attacks and strokes could be an early form of scurvy.
Heart Disease in the News

According to the National Heart Foundation, winter is the most dangerous season for people
with all types of heart conditions. Why? Researchers think respiratory infections like the flu,
pneumonia, and bronchitis pose a special threat for people with heart conditions.

Heart Disease Statistics

•Every 34 seconds a person in the United States dies from heart disease.
•More than 2,500 Americans die from heart disease each day.
•Every 20 seconds, a person in the United States has a heart attack.
•At least 250,000 people die of heart attacks each year before they reach a hospital.
•Studies show that under-educated people are more likely to suffer heart attacks.
•The countries with the highest death rates from heart disease are the Soviet Union,
Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The countries with the lowest
are Japan, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Canada.
•Almost 6 million hospitalizations each year (in the United States) are due to
cardiovascular disease.
•Since 1900, Cardio Vascular Disease has been the number 1 killer in the United States
for every year but 1918.

HOW DOES OBESITY HARM MY HEALTH?
•Obesity is linked to many serious health problems, including heart disease, high
blood pressure, strokes, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer.

•Heart disease: Fat is body tissue, just like muscle or bone, and it needs to be
supplied with blood. As you gain weight, more blood vessels must be created
and more blood must be pumped to service this new tissue. For every pound
of fat that you gain it takes approximately 1 mile of blood vessels to supply it.
Think of the strain on your poor heart if you gain 10, 20, or 50 pounds of
excess fat. The obese also tend to have high levels of blood fats, which can
build up on artery walls and narrow blood flow to the heart. So the heart has to
do more work but gets less nourishment – and that’s a recipe for heart trouble.
•High Blood Pressure: As the heart works harder to send blood through miles
and miles of excess fat tissue, it has to beat stronger, and more forcefully. This
sends blood pounding against artery walls, damaging them and causing little
cracks or scratches. Within these cracks, fatty, waxy material called plaque
can begin to accumulate. This provides a foothold for the buildup of more
plaque, which can eventually clog up an artery.
•Strokes: As the arteries clog up with plaque, they can become blocked. Or a
piece of plaque may break off and float through the bloodstream until it
reaches a smaller blood vessel and forms a blockage there. If a blockage
forms in an artery that feeds part of the brain, that part of the brain may be
damaged or destroyed. This is called a stroke.
•Diabetes: A substance called insulin helps sugar from the blood enter the
body’s hungry cells, where it is used for fuel. But too much fatty tissue makes it
difficult for the body to “listen” to the insulin, so the blood sugar just floats on
by the hungry cells and builds up in the bloodstream. The cells don’t get fed,
and the excess sugar in the blood can damage the kidneys, eyes, heart, and
nerves.
•Cancer: Obesity increases the risk of developing cancers of the colon, breast
(after menopause), uterus, kidney, and esophagus and may also be linked to
cancers of the gallbladder, ovaries, and pancreas. It’s estimated that 14
percent of deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of deaths in women are
due to overweight and obesity.

•HEART HEALTHY DIET
•A heart healthy diet begins by paying close attention to what you eat. You can reduce your
chance of developing atherosclerosis, the blocked arteries that cause heart disease with a
heart healthy diet. If the artery-clogging process has already begun, you can slow the rate at
which it progresses.

Feed Your Heart Well

Feeding your heart well is a powerful way to reduce or even eliminate some risk factors.
Adopting a heart-healthy nutrition strategy can help reduce total and LDL cholesterol (the
“bad”cholesterol), lower blood pressure, lower blood sugars, and reduce body weight.
While most dietary plans just tell you what you CAN’T eat (usually your favorite foods!), the
most powerful nutrition strategy helps you focus on what you CAN eat. In fact, heart disease
research has shown that adding heart-saving foods is just as important as cutting back on
others. Here are nine nutrition strategies to reduce your risk:

1. Eat more fish. Fish is a good source of protein and other nutrients. It also contains
omega-3 fatty acids, which may help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
2. Eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.
These beautiful and
delicious wonders of nature may be one of the most powerful strategies in fighting
heart disease.
3. Choose fat calories wisely. Keep these goals in mind:
4. Limit total fat grams.
5. Eat a bare minimum of saturated fats and trans fats (for example, fats found in
butter, margarine, salad dressing, fried foods, snack foods, sweets, and desserts).
6. When you use added fat, use fats high in monounsaturated fats (for example,
fats found in olive and peanut oil).
7. Eat a variety—and just the right amount—of protein foods. Commonly eaten
protein foods (meat, dairy products) are among the main culprits in increasing heart
disease risk. Reduce this nutritional risk factor by balancing animal, fish, and
vegetable sources of protein.
8. Limit cholesterol consumption.
Dietary cholesterol can raise blood cholesterol
levels, especially in high-risk people. Limiting dietary cholesterol has an added
bonus: You’ll also cut out saturated fat, as cholesterol and saturated fat are usually
found in the same foods. Get energy by eating complex carbohydrates (whole-wheat
pasta, sweet potatoes, whole-grain breads) and limit simple carbohydrates (regular
soft drinks, sugar, sweets). If you have high cholesterol, these simple carbohydrates
exacerbate the condition and may increase your risk for heart disease.
9. Feed your body regularly. Skipping meals often leads to overeating. Eating five to
six mini-meals is the best way to control blood sugars, burn fat calories more
efficiently, and regulate cholesterol levels.

Other Heart-Healthy Strategies

•Reduce salt intake. This will help you control your blood pressure.
•Exercise. The human body was meant to be active. Exercise strengthens the heart
muscle, improves blood flow, reduces high blood pressure, raises HDL cholesterol
(“good”cholesterol), and helps control blood sugars and body weight.
•Hydrate. Water is vital to life. Be sure to stay adequately hydrated.
•Enjoy every bite. Your motto should be dietary enhancement, not deprivation. When
you enjoy what you eat, you feel more positive about life, which helps you feel better.
An added bonus is that you eat less when you eat food you love, and that helps
control weight and reduce cholesterol levels.

HOW MUCH IS A SERVING
•When you’re trying to follow an eating plan that’s good for your heart, it may help to
know how much of a certain kind of food is considered a“serving.”The following

table offers some examples.
SERVING SIZES
Food/amount Serving/exchange The size of
1 cup cooked rice or pasta 2 starch tennis ball
1 slice bread 1 starch compact disc case
1 cup raw vegetables or fruit 1 fruit or vegetable baseball
1/2 cup cooked vegetables or fruit 1 fruit or vegetable fist
1 ounce cheese 1 high-fat protein pair of dice
1 teaspoon olive oil 1 fat** half dollar
3 ounces cooked meat 3 protein deck of cards or
cassette tape
3 ounces tofu 1 protein deck of cards or
cassette tape

* Remember to count fat servings that may be added to food while cooking, such as
oil, butter or shortening.

To Your Heart Health

By Louis Ignarro, Ph.D.
Nobel Laureate in Medicine

Your cardiovascular system is the driving force behind Cellular Nutrition. Over 100,000
miles in length and equipped with nearly six-trillion endothelial cells, your blood vessels
produce the Nitric Oxide that supports Cellular Nutrition. Endothelial-derived Nitric Oxide
functions in many important ways to support the cardiovascular and circulatory system.
Endothelial damage, from a poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise, results in deficient Nitric-
Oxide production and, therefore, increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, there
are easy ways to make your endothelium healthy by adjusting your diet, engaging in
moderate exercise and taking Niteworks®.

How does Nitric Oxide work?

Nitric Oxide, also known as NO, is the body’s most widespread signaling molecule. NO
promotes Cellular Nutrition by facilitating blood flow to every cell in the body. Because NO
expands the diameter of the arteries, more nutrients are delivered to the cells and more
waste products are removed from the cells. Nitric Oxide provides Cellular Nutrition to all
organs of the body and also protects these organs against injury and disease caused by
exposure to oxidants, a condition known as “oxidative stress.” NO is the body’s most potent
antioxidant, protecting cells against free radical damage. In this regard, NO functions just
like Vitamins E and C.

NO deficiency and Endothelial Dysfunction cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of
morbidity and untimely death in the U.S. and is sometimes associated with NO deficiency.
The diseases resulting from NO deficiency include hypertension, stroke, atherosclerosis,
heart attacks, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, gastrointestinal ulcers and erectile dysfunction.
A healthy vascular endothelium is essential to a healthy cardiovascular system because it is
required for normal NO production and action. Vascular-endothelial dysfunction leads to
decreased NO production and increased oxidative stress, creating a vicious cycle that
promotes further endothelial dysfunction.

Diet improves heart health

Another way to keep your endothelium healthy is through diet. A sensible diet that is low in
fats and carbohydrates, but rich in proteins, will go a long way in promoting cardiovascular
health. Decreased fat intake greatly reduces the body’s production of destructive free
radicals and decreased dietary carbohydrates limit the intake of calories. Eating a high-
protein diet maintains muscle mass and energy levels. The combination of high protein plus
low carbohydrates and fats can result in substantial weight loss, which further promotes a
healthy cardiovascular system.

A winning combination

The three lifestyle changes outlined–mild to moderate exercise, a high-protein diet and
Niteworks®–have something in common: they all play a role in enhancing the production
and action of endothelium-derived Nitric Oxide. For this reason, exercise, diet and
Niteworks® are a winning combination for maintaining and improving your endothelial
health–and a healthy endothelium means a healthy heart. When you combine their results,
you can easily see how your overall health and general well-being can improve.

Dr. Ignarro formulated Niteworks based on his special understanding of the pharmacology
of Nitric Oxide (NO) and cardiovascular health. Niteworks contains an amino acid complex
for NO production, an antioxidant package for NO protection, and other heart-healthy
ingredients. The amino acid complex includes: L-arginine, which is transported into
endothelial cells to produce NO, and L-critrulline, which is transported by a different
mechanism and then is recycled into L-arginine, creating more NO.

2 The use of L-critrulline in Niteworks makes it unique compared to other products in the
market. Niteworks contains a patented, proprietary blend of arginine and citrulline. Herbalife
told us that they have purchased the entire world’s supply of high quality citrulline so that we
will continue to have the best, most effective product on the market.

Niteworks exclusive formula boosts Nitric-Oxide action in three ways:

•L-Arginine is used by the body to produce Nitric Oxide*
•L-Citrulline is recycled by the body into L-Arginine*
•Vitamins C&amp;E extend the activity and life span of Nitric Oxide in the body*
•Other key ingredients include:
•Folic Acid and bioavailable calcium folinate to reduce homosysteine*
•Alpha Lipoic Acid which helps recycle these vitamins*
•Lemon balm, an herb that assists in relaxation*
3 Exercise increases the production of NO. But even with a regular exercise regimen, the
body may not produce sufficient quantities of NO to maintain normal levels in unhealthy
cells. Natural sources of L-arginine can include nuts, fruits, dairy and meats, while natural
sources of L-citrulline can include melon rinds and cucumbers. A low-fat diet also helps
increase the body’s production of NO. However, it can be difficult to get as much of the
amino acids from natural sources as in contained in Niteworks.

Due to the high levels of antioxidants in Niteworks, Herbalife is one of the first companies to
offer a product bearing FDA’s new qualified antioxidant health claim that ‘consumption of
antioxidant vitamins may reduce a risk of certain kinds of cancer.’

Niteworks is taken at night, when the body’s own production of NO is likely to be at its
lowest. It is a lemon-flavored powder that is mixed with water or juice before bedtime.
Niteworks can be used anytime! Many folks are using Niteworks as a sports drink. James
Craig ran his first half marathon (13.1 miles) last year while using Niteworks every night. He
had no muscle soreness during his training, which he said was incredible! He trained for 3 ½
months to get up to 13 miles. That next spring he ran another half marathon and got up to
11 miles in 1 month during that training. He used Niteworks as a sports drink ½ hour before
a run and also at night. Here is his recipe:

8 oz water

1 tsp Herbal Concentrate (any flavor)

2 scoops Niteworks

2 capfuls of Herbal Aloe Concentrate

4-6 oz fruit juice.

Michael Brock noticed his endurance and stamina increased dramatically in a short period
of time. He doesn’t get tired or suffer from soreness anymore like any athlete would when
working out at a very high intensity rate. He found that Niteworks helps prevent lactic acid
from building up in the body; a serious breakthrough for anyone who is serious about
exercising and would like to increase their stamina.

Because Niteworks acts as a bronchodilator to help the tubes in the lungs expand and bring
in more air, others are using it to successfully combat allergy-induced asthma. Studies have
shown that people with asthma, especially babies, have a deficiency of NO.

3 Niteworks improved the circulation to Sara Drost’s (Type I diabetic) father’s legs and helped
to heal an open wound on his foot that was resistant to medical intervention for 6 months
earlier. Prior to that time, he had one foot amputated due to the same open wound situation.
He saw dramatic changes in only one month of using Niteworks. Niteworks saved this
remaining foot! Doctors were amazed at the amount of circulation that was getting to his
foot! They canceled his scheduled amputation! Oh, his blood sugar has been more level
and consistent in that one month than it’s been in 5 years!

SHAPE UP YOUR LIFE

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

Anytime is the right time to get outdoors, get in shape and renew our commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind as you shape up.

1. TAKE TIME TO WARM UP

Spending 5 to 10 minutes warming up prepares your body for exercise. Walk before jogging. Jog before running. Just warm up at a pace that gradually gets your heart beating at 50 to 60 percent of your maximum heart rate. And don’t forget to stretch. Moving from side to side warms your muscles and prepares them for exercise. Warm muscles allow for a greater range of motion for your joints and make injuries less likely as well.

2. THINK VARIETY

Have you ever started a fitness program and then let it fizzle out? The reason could have been boredom. A program that includes  several fitness  activities–for  example,  walking  or biking on Mondays and Wednesdays and playing tennis or swimming on Fridays and Sundays–will help maintain your interest and keep you motivated. Need a change of scenery? Try varying the place you exercise with a new route for walking or biking. Having different options can allow you to pick the one that suits your mood and keeps your fitness program feeling fresh.

3. GET YOUR ANTIOXIDANTS

Don’t forget about the important role that proper nutrition plays in achieving an active lifestyle. Since exercise can increase the formation of free radicals, it’s always good to have some extra protection. Antioxidants, such as Vitamin C and beta-carotene, may play a role in preventing  cellular injury and delaying muscle fatigue. Try to get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, as they are packed with powerful antioxidants. Our targeted nutrition products also provide key antioxidants that protect muscles and joints against exercise-induced oxidative stress. So, remember to add antioxidants to your diet and get the most out of your fitness program.

SEVEN WAYS TO LOOK GREAT

Target These Major Muscle Groups

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

What is the easiest way to work the whole body? Very simply, I developed  what I call “The Simple 7”–the seven main muscle groups we work on throughout the week. The Simple 7 includes:

1. Chest

2. Biceps (Front of arms)

3. Triceps (Back of arms)

4. Abs (can be worked daily)

5. Back

6. Front of legs

7. Back of legs

Generally, I split a workout between alternating days: The first day I will work upper body, the next day lower body. Again, work abs every day to help strengthen the core. Doing some healthy cardio means a good

15 minutes of elevated heart rate. There is plenty of evidence to support the notion that 15 minutes of cardio daily has profound impact on heart health.

Don’t worry about trying to spend an hour on a treadmill; the added benefit is minimal and may actually work against you.

There are approximately 260 muscles in the body. So, why just work on seven, and why these seven? Well, it’s all about getting the most bang for your effort. When exercising, it’s best to work on large muscle groups. It’s as if you are fine-tuning a regular car engine as opposed to an engine in a toy boat. The larger the muscle, the more metabolic benefit, and the bigger the payoff when it comes to weight maintenance. The Simple 7 group consists of the fewest number of muscle groups one has to work on to achieve maximum benefit in an exercise routine. You can exercise with more or less, but if you attack these particular muscles, then you will achieve maximum benefit. Also, it’s important to realize that the body is a balanced machine, and you must work the lower with the upper, and the back with the front. The seven muscle groups provide total balance in an easy way.

HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU WORK OUT?

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

How much you work out depends on your schedule, but I recommend three to five times a week. I work out daily, but I incorporate  tremendous  variety into my routine for a number of reasons. One reason is to always keep it interesting. Another reason is to move the stress around the body. You don’t want to repeat the same exercise every day, because that will wear on the joints, bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments.

I generally recommend  splitting up the week. For those of you who can only work out three days a week, which  I consider  the minimum, either rotate Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Or you can do Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This allows one day in between for rest. This rest time gives the body an opportunity to grow and repair from the damage caused by exercise. Within those three days, you can rotate exercises, so Monday would be upper body and abs, Wednesday, lower body and abs, then Friday, upper body and abs again. The following Monday, you could rotate so that Monday is lower body and abs, Wednesday is upper body and abs, and then Friday is lower body and abs again.

This allows that necessary rest time between exercises for optimal muscle health. Three days a week is the basic minimum routine. On each day, the workouts should be split between cardio and resistance:

30 minutes of each is perfect. The cardio exercises should be rotated as well, so that Monday is the treadmill, Wednesday is the bike, and Friday is the elliptical. This again allows variety so that you’re not bored, and it spreads the stress around the body’s tissues so as to avoid overuse injuries that are so common.

If you prefer to exercise more, then five or even six days a week is recommended. With more days, you can split up your workouts more. For example, Monday, instead of just doing upper body, you do very specific upper body such as chest and biceps with abs. Remember, abs are done every day to strengthen your core. Then Tuesday you could do specific lower body such as quads, calves and abs. Going on to Wednesday, you’re back to upper body so that you’re doing upper back, triceps and abs; Thursday, hamstrings and abs. Then Friday you can repeat your Monday workout so that you’ve come full circle and have given your body ample time to rest. This is the best workout for the individual who does not have time to spend two hours in the gym every day.

The cardio exercise should be done after your strength workout. I prefer this for a couple of reasons. First, you will not be as tired for your strength training, for which it is important to be well rested. A second reason is sweat. After running on a treadmill or stair stepper for 30 minutes, your body’s sweat and salts are coming out of your pores, which makes for a more challenging weight workout. The bar may be slipping from your grasp; you’ll be sliding around in the machines, and so forth. So try to do weights first, then cardio. The only reason I recommend some people start with cardio is that those individuals are very tight and tell me that their muscles are cold in the morning. For these people, I think cardio beforehand may actually improve their workouts. It tends to make them more limber and gets the blood circulating around the body.

CALORIE BURNERS:

ACTIVITIES THAT TURN UP THE HEAT

 By Susan Bowerman, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. 

When it comes to burning calories, most of us want to get as much mileage out of our exercise as possible. For many, the more calories we burn, the better we feel about our workout. While energy expenditure should not be the only measure of a good workout (remember: it’s good for you and it makes you feel better too!), it is helpful to know what a given activity might be costing you in terms of calories.

A word of caution, though, about counting calories: Simply burning more calories will take you only so far down the road to better health. A well-balanced, low-fat diet, plenty of rest and a healthy attitude are also essential. And, of course, all things in moderation–including  exercise.

READING THE CHART:

The numbers of the chart on the next page correspond to how many calories individuals burn per hour during different activities. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you review this chart. With exercise, it really is true that you get out of it what you put into it. Simply showing up for class and going through the motions is not going to do you much good. To get the most out of your exercise session, give it your all, even if your all is less than what others might be doing. And don’t forget to look for little ways to increase the number of calories you burn each day. You might be surprised to learn that it is possible to burn more calories simply by becoming more active in your everyday life. Doing things like using the stairs, walking to the mailbox instead of driving, and doing active chores around the house are great ways to burn additional calories.

Calorie-Burning Activity Chart

As an example for how to use this chart, look up how many calories you’re burning by engaging in different activities. The more active the exercise, the more calories you burn.

MODERATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY                                                   APPROXIMATE CALORIES/HOUR FOR A 154-POUND PERSON*

Hiking                                                                                                            370

HOW MUCH DOES IT TAKE TO BURN IT OFF?

Many people tend to overestimate the calories burned through exercise, and assume that a little exercise will burn off the calories in any indulgence. The chart below gives the calories in various foods, and the amount and type of exercise needed to burn off those calories.

 FOOD AMOUNT CALORIES TO BURN IT OFF… Chocolate drop 1 drop 25 6 minutes of walking Microwave popcorn 4 cups 140 20 minutes of biking Potato skins with cheese and bacon 1 average serving 1,100 187 minutes of dancing Candy bar 1 bar 280 30 minutes of singles tennis Chocolate fudge brownie ice cream 1½ cups 780 90 minutes of playing racquetball Potato chips 1 ounce 160 90 minutes of playing Frisbee Stuffed crust pizza 2 slices 1,000 2½ hours of ice skating Chocolate frosted donut 1 donut 360 1 hour of playing baseball Mocha frappuccino with whipped cream 16 ounces 380 130 minutes of playing billiards Pumpkin pie with whipped cream 1 slice 350 30 minutes jumping rope Stuffing with gravy 1 cup stuffing, ½ cup gravy 425 100 minutes golfing (no cart) Chocolate chip cookies 4 small 400 120 minutes of bowling Mixed nuts ½ cups 435 165 minutes of dusting Macaroni and cheese 1 cup 430 45 minutes of stair-climbing Pecan pie 1 slice 500 60 minutes of swimming Eggnog 1 cup 350 52 minutes of playing half-court basketball Double burger with fries 1 burger&amp;large fries 1,100 2 hours of jogging Ranch dressing 2 tablespoons 150 30 minutes of doing aerobics Mayonnaise 1 tablespoon 100 22 minutes of brisk walking 

EXERCISE FOR BODY AND MIND

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

There are so many benefits to exercise, and every day, we are discovering new ones.

A recent Newsweek article discussed how exercise can boost brain power and fight off diseases like Alzheimer’s–more incredible information in an already long list of benefits. New research in animal models has shown that exercise stimulates a hormone called IGF-I or insulin such as growth factor-I, which, in turn, goes to the brain to stimulate another brain-derived-neutrotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is believed to facilitate a process in which an animal’s brain nerve cells branch out and communicate with each other. In fact, research has supported that theory that a brain with lower levels of BDNF is challenged with retaining new information. How amazing is exercise–not only does it build the body, but the mind as well! Exercise not only slows the aging process in the brain, but reverses it. Research has also shown that active adults have less inflammation in the brain and fewer transient ischemic attacks, or ministrokes, which can impair cognition. People who exercise regularly tend to have higher levels of neurotransmitters that regulate mood, such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinepherine. With so many people on psychotropic medication, exercise is proving to be an inexpensive method of maintaining mental health. As with the body’s muscle mass, the same holds true for the brain: Use it or lose it. Within just a short month of stopping physical activity, the new brain tissue connections that were formed basically shrink down back to normal.

Many parents of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) already know the benefits of physical activity on their children. It tends to help regulate their moods. An exercise prescription can often be given in conjunction with medication for these ADHD children/or may even replace a medication regimen.

This has broad-ranging implications for children in school and their curriculum. With so many schools having downsized the number of physical education classes with a focus on more class time, this could be detrimental. That extra time on the playground may actually boost test scores in all children. The great thing about introducing physical education at an early age in school is that it sets the tone for future exercise. Once a healthy habit like exercise is established, it tends to carry on. When people understand the importance, it becomes even more of a regular routine.

So, we know the benefits of exercise for all types of health. Not only does exercise help with chronic conditions, it also promotes wellness.

FITTING IN FITNESS

•    Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator, for at least a few floors. If you have to take the escalator, make it a point to walk it.

•    Walk or bike to nearby destinations instead of always driving.

•    When at the mall doing your holiday shopping, park your car farthest from where you intend to shop.

•    Get off the bus a few blocks early, or park a few blocks from work.

•    Exercise while watching television, especially during commercials.

•    Hide your remote control and get up to change TV channels or adjust the volume.

•    Busy yourself with housework, such as vacuuming, washing the floors, polishing furniture, washing the windows or gift-wrapping.

•    In the evenings, take your family for a walk around neighborhoods that have great holiday lights on the houses.

•    Take the dog for a walk.

•    Work in the garden or yard–raking the leaves or sweeping the patio.

•    Go for a short walk before breakfast and after dinner.

•    Spend half your lunch hour eating and the other half walking around the building or parking lot.

Get your coworkers to join you.

•    Walk up and down the stairs on your breaks at work.

•    Several times a day, take a few moments to move around and stretch your legs, regardless of what you’re doing.

•    When on your cell phone or cordless home phone, walk around while you talk.

•    Clean up the garage or organize your closets or kitchen cupboards.

•    Go shopping. You don’t have to buy anything, just walk the aisles and look at the items.

 
 
 Suger 
 
Week 9: Sugar

SURROUNDED BY SUGAR

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

I always encourage  my patients, when shopping, to avoid sugar and, instead, look for protein. Since we live in a carbohydrate-rich society, it’s not always easy to find low-calorie, healthful foods, which are generally expensive and have a short shelf life. This is all too obvious when traveling. Whether it’s the airport or a gas station, high-protein foods that are low in sugar are difficult to find. The next time you walk into a gas station, a food stop, or a snack bar in the airport, look around. You will see lots of chips, candies, crackers, doughnuts, muffins and plenty of soda. Generally, the only protein is beef jerky, almonds and milk. Now protein bars are coming into fashion, but they are not widespread. The problem with snacking on these sugary foods is the empty calories. You want to make your calories count, and sugar doesn’t help much. Prepackaged foods that are high in sugar generally do not have a high-nutrient density.

Protein is the nutrient of interest for most of the current diets. In the 1980s, the high-carbohydrate diet was king, but this diet has proven deleterious to most people. We do need carbohydrates–remember, it’s like the fuel you add in the gas tank of your car–but unless you’re training for a marathon, you do not need that much. Generally, about 40 percent to 50 percent of your daily calories can come from carbohydrates, which means that on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet, that is approximately 800 to 1,000 calories, which translates into the typical Western breakfast of a large latte and a muffin. Under these conditions, you’re usually tapped out by 10 a.m. with all the carbs you need for the day. Now imagine adding some pizza, a hamburger and a soda, a mid-afternoon coffee, a bag of chips and then maybe some bread with dinner. It’s not hard to quickly accumulate 4,000 calories. Cutting carbohydrates out of the diet is the basis of most, if not all, of the popular diet programs today.

The idea of a low-fat diet has changed, and now a diet rich in healthy fats–such as monounsaturated fats from nuts, avocados and olive oil, and polyunsaturated fats from fish oil and flaxseed–is popular. The percentage for dietary protein can vary widely, but most experts target around 30 percent.

SUGAR HIDE-AND-SEEK

 By Susan Bowerman, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. 

Say the word “sugar” and most people picture the familiar white granular stuff many of us have in a sugar bowl at home. But what is sugar exactly?

Table sugar is just one form of sugar that we get in the diet. Sugars are carbohydrates, and they exist naturally in different forms and in all kinds of foods. The granulated sugar that you might sprinkle on your cereal is called sucrose, which is produced primarily by extracting the sugar from sugar beets or sugar cane, although it is present in lots of other plant foods, too. The primary sugar in fruits is called fructose, and there is a naturally occurring sugar in milk called lactose. When you consume a fruit, a vegetable or a dairy product, you can’t avoid consuming the natural sugar that these foods contain.

All sugars ultimately end up in the bloodstream in the form of glucose, which is the form of sugar that our body prefers to use for energy. While sugars in foods end up as glucose in the bloodstream, so do the end-products of the digestion of all carbohydrate-rich  foods like fruits, vegetables and starchy foods.

The concern about sugar intake from added sugars (not the naturally occurring ones) has mostly to do with the fact that they are considered to be “empty calories”–that is, sugar provides calories (which the body uses for energy) but no vitamins or minerals. So, if you consume a lot of sugary foods instead of healthier items, you are shortchanging yourself by not getting enough of the vitamins, minerals, fiber and healthy phytonutrients that carbohydrate-rich natural foods contain.

We eat a lot of sugar–even in foods that don’t taste sweet. Aside from the obvious items like sodas, fruit drinks, sweetened cereals and desserts, sugar–in one form or another–finds its way into condiments, soups, breads and even savory snacks like chips. The primary health hazard of eating too much sugar is tooth decay. The bacteria that live in your mouth can convert sugars into an acid that can destroy tooth enamel. Foods that are sweet and sticky, like fruit snacks or gummy candies, are particularly a problem since the sugar stays in contact with the teeth.

Does sugar make you fat? Certainly sugar adds extra calories to the diet, and extra calories mean extra weight. Most studies have focused on soda consumption, and several have concluded that as soda consumption increases, so does the risk of obesity. Part of the problem with beverages is that they don’t fill us up–so we can consume a lot of calories in these sweet liquids and still consume regular solid foods, too, before we feel full.

The other issue is that many foods that are high in added sugars are also high in fats and calories–cakes, pastries, ice cream and candy bars are just some of the sweet foods we eat that are loaded down with fat and calories. Food manufacturers are more than happy to accommodate America’s sweet tooth–sugar is inexpensive and adds a lot of taste to foods. To know how much sugar you are eating, it’s important to understand that many forms of sugar are added to foods. By reading the label, you may not realize how much sugar a food really contains.

Here are some other forms of sugar that you might see on a label: sucrose, fructose, glucose, dextrose, lactose, maltose, invert sugar, raw sugar, turbinado sugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, brown rice syrup, fruit juice concentrate, confectioner’s sugar, maltodextrin, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup and molasses.

One popular breakfast cereal marketed to children has the following ingredients: corn, sugar, corn syrup, modified cornstarch, canola oil and high-fructose corn syrup, followed by some vitamins, minerals, and artificial colors and flavors. This cereal isn’t much more than a bowl of sugar, oil and starch.

When you look at a food label, the sugar content is listed–in grams per serving–just under the total carbohydrate listing. But this includes all sugars in the food including natural sugars, so it can be deceptive. For instance, a bran cereal with no added sugar but with raisins in it might look as high in sugar as a sugary kid’s cereal. But there is a big difference in the nutritional value of the two foods, since one might contain only the natural sugar from the fruit, while the kid’s cereal will contain all added sugar.

How can you reduce your sugar intake? Try to obtain your sugars naturally–which should be primarily from fresh, whole fruit.

•     Fruit juices, even if they are 100 percent fruit juice, are all-natural sugar but they are very high in calories–it’s best to avoid beverages with high calories, including fruit juices, sodas, lemonade and other sweetened beverages. Learn to enjoy your iced tea for its natural flavor, rather than for the flavor of the sugar that you pour into the glass.

•     Rather than adding syrup or honey to foods like waffles or pancakes, try topping them with sliced fresh fruit and a dollop of vanilla yogurt.

•     Look for whole-grain cereals without added sugars, and top with sliced bananas, berries or other fruit that appeals to you. This applies to both cold cereals and hot. Oatmeal is delicious with some mashed banana stirred in for sweetness.

•    Keep healthy snacks around, like whole fruits, cut vegetables, whole-grain crackers, low-fat yogurt

and low-fat cheese, so you won’t be tempted to eat sweets instead.

•     Help your kids develop healthier habits–if they are old enough to read labels, give them a list of all the names for sugar and ask them to become “sugar detectives.” They will enjoy finding the hidden sources of sugar in foods, and it will help to educate them as to how much sugar is added– sometimes where you least expect it.

•     Instead of baked goods for desserts, try fresh fruit with a bit of chocolate syrup. One great trick is to take ripe bananas, peel and place them on a foil-lined tray in the freezer. Frozen bananas taste just like ice cream and will satisfy your sweet tooth for significantly fewer calories.

•     If you add sugar to cereals, beverages and fruits routinely, try to gradually reduce the amount you use. You may not really know the true flavor of these foods because you have “masked” the flavor

with sugar. Fresh fruits in season should be deliciously sweet–no added sugar necessary.

SIZING UP SUGAR FOR KIDS

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

Sugar is a short-term source of both energy and pleasure. But the fact is, kids today are on sugar overload! According to a study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association , kids are getting a staggering 29 teaspoons of refined sugar per day. This overconsumption  of sugar is causing a variety of problems and health issues.

Currently, about a third of the nation’s children and teens are either overweight or obese, and a high-sugar diet is often the cause. Sugar can make it difficult to lose weight because of constantly high insulin levels, which cause the body to store excess carbohydrates as fat. It can also suppress the immune system, cause tooth decay, and even lead to diabetes. What’s more, too much sugar can also result in energy peaks and valleys.

HIGHS AND LOWS

After sugar consumption, children experience a rapid rise of the stimulant hormone adrenaline, which causes hyperactivity.  In fact, a recent study at Yale University School  of Medicine revealed that, when ingested by children, sugar releases twice the amount of adrenaline into the bloodstream as it does in adults. Kids then experience a crashing low, as refined sugars break down very quickly in the body, leaving them tired, irritable and unable to concentrate.

THE CULPRITS

So, which foods contain the most calories from sugar? It all starts with breakfast. Sugar accounts for more than a third of the weight of children’s cereals. They contain about 52 percent more sugar than adult cereals and have less protein and fiber.

Another big concern is sugar-sweetened  sodas. They are the largest source of added sugar in the daily diets of U.S. children. Each 12 oz. carbonated soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories. And juice-flavored drinks aren’t any better. They often contain as much added sugar as soft drinks and also tend to be high in calories and low in valuable nutrients.

So, instead of giving your child sugar-loaded cereals and beverages, offer them healthier alternatives, such as fruit. It’s a naturally sweet snack that also contains fiber and vitamins they need.

 
 
 THE FIBER FACTOR 
 
Week 8: Fiber

THE FIBER FACTOR

 By Susan Bowerman, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. 

More than 100 years ago, someone figured out how to separate the bran from grains of wheat, leaving only the starchy interior to be ground into flour. From this discovery, an amazing new product–white bread– was born. But the introduction of refined flour products certainly contributed to the nation’s slow decline in dietary fiber intake.

It has been estimated that our hunter-gatherer ancestors–who foraged for food for hours every day–ate about 12 pounds of plant foods a day and about 100 grams of fiber. If we did that, we’d spend a good part of our day just eating. But the average American falls far short of meeting the fiber recommendation of 25 to 30 grams a day. In fact, most of us only eat about 15 grams. Fiber is the structural portion of a plant, and so it is found in whole fruits, vegetables, beans and grains (like corn and brown rice); there is no fiber in meats, fish or poultry. Different types of fibers have different effects on the body, and it’s important to get plenty of fiber from a variety of sources.

Water-soluble fibers are found in the highest concentration in apples, oranges, carrots, potatoes, oats, barley and beans. These types of fiber delay the time it takes for food to pass through the system, and so they provide a feeling of fullness. They also slow the absorption of glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream and so they help to keep blood-sugar levels more even throughout the day. This type of fiber is also helpful in lowering blood cholesterol levels, which is why oats and oat bran have been popular for heart health.

Water-insoluble fibers are found in the highest concentrations in vegetables, wheat bran, corn bran, rice bran and most other whole grains. These fibers speed up the transfer of food through the intestines and also trap water, so they are particularly good in helping to prevent constipation.

The health benefits of a high-fiber diet are numerous. Most people are aware that fiber keeps the intestinal tract functioning smoothly. The fiber not only helps prevent constipation, but also reduces the risk of hemorrhoids. For those wanting to lose weight, a high-fiber diet is a great way to go. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains have fewer calories “per bite” than do foods that have a lot of fat and sugar. Also, the fibers keep food in the stomach longer and absorb water, so they provide the sensation of fullness.

Can you get too much? Adding too much fiber to the diet in a short period of time might lead to abdominal discomfort and gas, so if your diet is usually low in fiber, increase the amount slowly over a few weeks to give your system time to adjust. Also, drink plenty of liquid to allow the fiber to soften and swell. And make sure to eat a variety of fiber sources to reap all the health benefits that high-fiber foods provide.

Tips for Increasing Fiber Intake

•    Eat whole fruits with skin more often than drinking fruit juices.

•    Use whole fruit as a dessert.

•    Eat a variety of whole vegetables–cooked and raw–and eat them freely.

•    Use whole-grain cereals, oatmeal and bran cereals more often than refined cereals, like cream of wheat or corn flakes.

•    Use 100 percent whole-grain breads, waffles, rolls, English muffins and crackers instead of those made with white flour.

•    Try whole-grain pasta.

•    Use corn tortillas rather than flour.

•    Use brown rice, wild rice, millet, barley and cracked wheat as alternatives to white rice.

•    Add beans to main-dish soups, stews, chili or salads.

•    Add wheat bran or oat bran to meat loaves or meatballs.

•    For snacks, use whole-grain pretzels, popcorn or low-fat bran muffins as alternatives to cakes, cookies and chips.

•    If you have trouble meeting your fiber intake, you can use fiber supplements. But remember that fiber supplements don’t replace the healthy fruits, vegetables and whole grains that you should be consuming.

EAT YOUR FRUITS AND VEGGIES

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

When our mothers told us, “Eat your fruits and veggies,” they were right. They are an essential part of our diet, providing a wide range of vitamins and minerals that serve an array of important functions in the body. Many people, however, are still deficient in their fruit and vegetable intake.

NOT GETTING THE MESSAGE

Over the last several years, the U.S. Department of Health has recommended eating at least five portions of fruits and vegetables a day. Yet, only 1-in-7 achieve this quota. In fact, one-third of American adults eat only two servings of fruits and vegetables a day and are four times more likely to choose a processed snack instead. On any given day, about half the population eats no fruit at all.

A BUSHEL OF REASONS

There is a rainbow of reasons to eat a variety of colors from the produce aisle. Fruits and vegetables are virtually fat free, low in salt and an excellent source of fiber. Some fruits and vegetables, such as carrots and cantaloupe, provide Vitamin A, which maintains eye health and immunity. Other fruits and vegetables, such as bananas and spinach, contain potassium, which is necessary for proper nerve and muscle functioning. Green vegetables, such as broccoli and asparagus, provide B vitamins, which are necessary for converting food into energy. But all fruits and vegetables contain phytonutrients, the health-promoting components of plants. Scientific studies show that phytonutrients can help protect seven key organs, including the eyes, heart, liver and skin, and they may also serve as antioxidants.

ANTIOXIDANT PROTECTION

Current research has measured the total antioxidant power of various foods, citing fruits and vegetables at the top of the list. Antioxidants protect our bodies from free radicals that can cause damage to cellular membranes. Antioxidants also boost our immunity, help make our muscles stronger and support bone and skin health. Since eating the recommended daily servings of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables is not always realistic, try supplementing your diet with appropriate products. Herbalife’s Garden 7®  dietary supplement protects your health with the powerful phytonutrient and antioxidant benefits found in seven servings of colorful fruits and vegetables. It also supports your body’s vital organs by providing them with key nutrients.*

So, try to get in the habit of eating plenty of produce each day. It’s one of the biggest favors you can do for your body.

 DINING-OUT GUIDE 
 
Week 7: Dining Out

DINING-OUT GUIDE

APPETIZERS

Enjoy vegetable-based  soups, steamed seafood or fresh juice. Try to avoid the fried, cheesy and/or creamy appetizers.

BREAD AND ROLLS

Try choosing whole-grain or rye breads without butter. Limit your bread consumption by asking your server to remove the basket from the table.

ALCOHOL

Alcoholic beverages are often the source of many additional calories.

•     Wine, 6 oz., 120 calories

•     Beer, 12 oz., 146 calories

•     Screwdriver, 6 oz., 150 calories

•     Tequila sunrise, 6 oz., 210 calories

•     Margarita, 8 oz., 400 calories

To cut calories try seltzer or light beer.

LOW FAT

Steamed, broiled, baked, roasted, boiled, wine sauce, grilled, stir-fried, poached

HIGH FAT

Fried, sautéed, batter dipped, creamed, cream sauce, cheese sauce, marinated in oil, special sauce, crispy

SALADS

Can be the source of a lot of hidden fat and calories. Try ordering light dressing served on the side. Beware of high-fat extras like bacon, cheese, cold cuts and mayonnaise-based salads. Avoid the crusts and shells that some salads are served in.

ENTREES

Choose meat dishes with portion sizes of 6 ounces or less. Fish and poultry breast have fewer calories than red meats. Ask your waitperson to serve the entrée without butter, margarine, sour cream or cheese topping, and order sauces on the side.

DINING-OUT GUIDE (CONTINUED)

DESSERT

Desserts can make or break a meal. Sidestep high-calorie desserts by choosing fresh fruit or sorbet, or have a decaf coffee or some herbal tea.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

•     Have an apple or glass of water before leaving for the restaurant to curb your appetite.

•     Alcohol may stimulate your appetite. Limit your consumption.

•     Have your server remove your plate as soon as you are finished.

Remember that you do not have to finish everything on your plate; ask for a doggie bag. You can also ask that half your food be put in a doggie bag before it is served to you–then you can still finish your food and have the rest for the next day.

ORDERING GUIDELINES

•     Request food to be baked, broiled, steamed, poached or grilled instead of fried.

•     Try ordering two appetizers, or a soup and salad, instead of an entrée.

•     Split a large meal with a companion, and order an extra salad or vegetable.

•     Portions are large, so avoid the temptation to clean your plate; ask for a doggie bag.

•     Ask that sauces and gravies be served on the side.

•     Ask questions about meal-preparation  techniques if you are unsure.

•     Ask that the chef prepare your meal in wine rather than butter or oil.

•     Order double portions of vegetables to replace rice or potatoes.

COOKING METHODS Example:

•     10 oz. potato, 200 calories

•     10 oz. baked potato, 235 calories with one pat butter

•     Large french fries, 400 calories

•     Large baked potato with chili and cheese, 630 calories

Following these guidelines can help you make changes that will allow you to incorporate new eating habits into your lifestyle. The more consistent you are with your changes, the better your chance at achieving your goals.

FAST-FOOD FRENZY

For many of us, when we go out to eat, it’s tempting to let our guard down a bit. Sometimes we think, “I paid for it, so I’m going to eat it,” or we reward ourselves for a hard or difficult day. But if you eat out fairly often, your choices can definitely impact your overall diet. Take a look at the examples below, and see how you can save fat and calories at some of your favorite places.

This week’s tip is to help you make healthier decisions when eating out. By looking at the chart below, you can see how you can replace high-fat foods with some lower-calorie alternatives. You can try some similar changes at your favorite places, and many chain restaurants even list their nutrition information online to help you plan ahead. Just because it’s fast food doesn’t mean it has to be unhealthy.

c.   Barbecued corn, creamed spinach and chopped salad with Thousand Island dressing

ANSWER KEY: THE INS AND OUTS OF DINING OUT

The questions below ask you to picture yourself in different settings and determine what would be the best selection in each case.

1. You are at your favorite Mexican restaurant. Which item would be the best choice?

a.   A taco salad

b.   A vegetable quesadilla

 c. Grilled chicken soft tacos with salsa and guacamole 

 Th e best choice would be the grilled chicken soft tacos. A taco salad typically has a fried tortilla as the base or the shell to contain the contents, which can add several hundred calories. Even if you don’t eat the shell, the salads are often loaded with cheese, sour cream and salad dressing. A vegetable quesadilla may sound healthy, but the large flour tortilla has about 350 calories, and 3 ounces of shredded cheese adds another 300. The vegetables are likely grilled in oil, so the whole quesadilla could cost you over 

 800 calories. 

2. You are meeting a friend for coffee. You decide to skip breakfast so you can get something to eat at the coffeehouse. What would be your best choice?

a.   A low-fat muffin and some nonfat hot cocoa

 b. Half a toasted bagel with light cream cheese and a small nonfat latte 

c.   A slice of coffee cake and black coffee

 Don’ t be fooled by the low-fat label. Many low-fat baked goods have just as many calories as traditional items–they often have less fat but a lot more sugar to make them taste good. Typical muffins can run almost 500 calories because they are so huge, and the nonfat cocoa still packs a lot of calories because of the sugar. A slice of coffee cake and black coffee sounds light because it’s relatively small, but it could still run you at least 400 calories. A half a bagel with light cream cheese is only about 200 calories, and the latte would give you some healthy protein for about another 90 to 100 calories, so this would be the best choice. 

3. You are in a hurry and have to stop at the nearest burger drive-through window. What would be your best choice?

a.   A fish sandwich without mayonnaise and a diet soda

 b. A hamburger with mustard and ketchup only, iced tea and a soft-serve kiddie ice cream cone 

c.   A green salad with two packets of ranch dressing and iced tea

 Some people think that fish is better than beef, regardless of how it is cooked. In most fast-food places, the fish is fried, so the calories are really high. Your best bet of the three selections above would be the plain burger and the small soft-serve cone. Why not the green salad? The salad itself has a low calorie count, but without any protein in it, you’ll be hungry in no time. Add two packets of dressing, which is four servings, and you’ve just dumped about 350 calories of fat on your meal. The burger meal with the kiddie cone adds up to only about 300 calories. 

4. The snack machine at work is calling to you. What would be the best selection?

a.   A bag of baked potato chips

 b. A cereal bar 

c.   A bag of trail mix

 A half a cup of trail mix can log in at about 400 calories, even though it sounds healthy. The nuts and raisins add up quickly–and if you toss chocolate chips and banana chips (which are fried) into the mix, the calories climb. Baked potato chips run about 110 calories an ounce, which would be less than the cereal bar at 

 140 calories per bar, but if the chip bag contains more than an ounce of chips, the cereal bar would be a better bet. 

5. You’ve had a busy day of shopping at the mall, and the Chinese food at the food court smells so good. Which would be the best choice?

a.   Stir-fried vegetable chow mein

 b. Beef and broccoli with half a bowl of steamed rice 

c.   Two egg rolls and a bowl of wonton soup

 B ee f a n d broccoli would be your best bet. Stir-fried vegetable chow mein is loaded with oil and the calories in all those noodles add up quickly. Two egg rolls and a cup of wonton soup sounds like a light meal, but the fried egg rolls are about 350 calories and the soup about the same–a total of 700 calories for such a small meal. Beef and broccoli with steamed rice will have fewer calories and much more nutrition than either of the other choices. 

ANSWER KEY: THE INS AND OUT OF DINING OUT (CONTINUED)

6. You are taking some calorie-conscious friends out to dinner. Where would you be most likely to find the most healthy selections?

 a. A Greek restaurant 

b.   A French restaurant

c.           An Indian restaurant

 Y our best bet here would likely be the Greek restaurant. Mediterranean restaurants generally have good offerings in the way of fish dishes, vegetables and salads. French food is notoriously rich; Indian food may seem healthy because of its emphasis on vegetarian dishes, but there is often a lot of butter and cream lurking in the curry dishes. 

7. The appetizer offerings at your favorite steakhouse all sound good, but which of the following would be the best one to start your meal in a healthy way?

a.   Chicken wings with barbecue sauce

b.   Spinach dip with melba toast

 c. Sliced tomatoes and mozzarella with basi l

 Even though you’ll be consuming a little cheese with your tomato salad, this is still your best bet of the three. Mozzarella is a low-fat cheese, and the sliced tomatoes add very few calories to this dish. Don’t be fooled into thinking that the dip is healthy because it contains spinach. The dish is loaded with all kinds of rich and creamy ingredients and is very high calorie. Similarly, chicken wings–while small–are usually fried, and the portions are generous. 

8. You’ve had a pretty healthy meal for a special dinner out with friends, so you decide to have dessert. Which of these would have the fewest calories?

a.   A slice of strawberry cheesecake

 b. A scoop of ice cream with berries and a drizzle of chocolate syrup 

c.   A slice of carrot cake

 The ice cream is actually your best choice here. The portion is relatively small, and chocolate syrup has only about 50 calories per tablespoon. The dessert seems special, but has fewer calories than the other two. In most restaurants, carrot cake has even more calories than cheesecake, which is already very high in calories. Carrot cake sounds healthy, but it’s loaded with oil and is typically frosted with sweetened cream cheese. 

9. You’re on a vacation, and it’s time to hit the breakfast buffet at the hotel. What would be the best meal for you?

a.   Two large pancakes with no butter–just syrup–and a glass of orange juice

 b. Two scrambled eggs with diced ham and some fresh fruit 

c.   A bowl of granola topped with raisins and low-fat milk and a glass of cranberry juice

 Don’t be fooled by the healthy sounding granola. Some are as high as 450 calories a cup, so unless you really control portions, you’ll be running up a hefty calorie bill by the time you add raisins (at 30 calories a tablespoon), low-fat milk for 120 calories, and cranberry juice at 160 calories per 8 oz. glass. The pancakes and orange juice breakfast could cost you nearly 600 calories, and with almost no protein in the meal, you’ll be hungry an hour later. Ham is a relatively lean meat to add to the scrambled eggs, and the fresh fruit will add bulk to your meal and keep you full, so the egg breakfast is the best choice. 

10. You are at a potluck barbecue, and there is a huge array of side dishes to accompany the barbecued chicken. You want to sample three. Which of the following groups would make the best choice?

a.   Fruit salad, potato salad and traditional cole slaw

 b. Cucumbers in vinaigrette dressing, baked beans and grilled peppers 

c.   Barbecued corn, creamed spinach and chopped salad with Thousand Island dressing

 Th e bes t choice would be choice (b). The first grouping contains fruit, which is great, but potato salad and traditional cole slaw are loaded with mayonnaise and calories. In choice (c), the barbecued corn is a good selection, but the creamy spinach and salad with creamy dressing turn these healthy vegetables into big loads of fat. Choice (b) offers a good range of nutritious foods–the cucumbers in vinaigrette are relatively low calorie, as are the grilled peppers. The baked beans are low in fat, high in fiber and contain some protein, too–making this group the best choice. 

 

 
 
 WEIGHT LOSS BEGINS WITH DIGESTIVE HEALTH 
 
Week 6: Digestive Health

WEIGHT LOSS BEGINS WITH DIGESTIVE HEALTH

Your digestive system is one of the most essential components of your entire body. According to a recent survey, people have a keen interest in digestive health issues. More than 50 percent of people surveyed have grown more concerned about their digestive health in the past two years. And a solid 80 percent feel it’s important to improve their body’s digestive health, although they’re not doing much about it.

HERBALIFE FOR DIGESTIVE HEALTH

Digestive health can affect other areas of our health–weight, energy, skin and immunity–in ways we might never have imagined. It’s important to understand the link between digestive health and overall wellness.

To get the most from your weight-loss program, start off with Herbalife’s 21-Day Herbal Cleansing Program, then soothe your system with Herbalife® Herbal Aloe Drink for improved digestion. Add in Herbalife® Active Fiber powder for regularity, and Herbalife®  Florafiber for friendly bacteria and intestinal health.

DIGESTIBLE FACTS

•     The small intestine is where the majority of digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place.*

•     The health of your digestive system can significantly affect your immune function.

•     A majority of Americans consume only about 14 grams of fiber per day, while the Institute of Medicine recommends 38 grams for men under age 50, and 25 grams for women in the same age group.*

DIGEST THIS!

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

Q: WHY IS DIGESTIVE HEALTH SO VALUABLE?

A: Most people have experienced digestive issues at some point in their lives. Many modern diets lack the sufficient nutrition, such as fiber, for good digestive health. Fiber is essential for weight management and intestinal health but most people only eat half the recommended daily dietary fiber intake.

Q: WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE MY FIBER INTAKE?

A: I always encourage  people to eat five to seven servings of fruits and vegetables each day to get their daily fiber intake. But I realize how challenging it is to do that with our modern diet and on-the-go lifestyle. That is why I recommend taking supplements that contribute to promoting regularity, a feeling of fullness and the growth of “friendly” intestinal bacteria.

Q: HOW DOES HERBALIFE®  HERBAL ALOE PROMOTE DIGESTIVE HEALTH?

A: Herbalife’s Herbal Aloe formula is gentle and soothing because we filter out the laxative stimulant, alloin, to produce an Herbal Aloe with all of the organic nutrients of the aloe plant. The aloe plant contains over 75 substances known for their healing properties. Herbal Aloe assists your body’s self-cleansing action and healthy elimination.* Plus you can support healthy digestion wherever you are with Herbalife’s ready-to-drink form.

To maintain a healthy digestive system, support your healthy diet with plenty of fiber and Herbalife’s other digestive health products, such as Active Fiber powder, Florafiber and 21-Day Herbal Cleansing Program.

Protein                            5 g                10%

One of the most important skills you can master is being able to read a food label in order to figure out exactly what you are getting from your foods.

Let’s look at the example to the left and take the information from top to bottom…

Serving Size and Servings per Container: Pay attention to this closely. Many people assume that small  packages of cookies  or crackers, or medium-sized   beverage  containers   are  single servings. But this may not be the case. An “official” serving of a beverage is 8 ounces, but many drinks are packaged in 16 oz. containers or larger. All the nutrition facts on the label are for one serving. If you drink a 16 oz. beverage, you will be drinking twice the number of calories on the nutrition facts panel, since you’ll be taking in two servings. You will need to  double   all  the  information  on  the  label  to determine exactly what you are taking in.

Calories, Fat, Carbohydrate  and Protein:

As with all the other nutrients, these are the amounts per serving. In the example to the left, one cup of

Chunky, Cheesy, Rich and Creamy Broccoli Soup has 250 calories. But if you consume the whole package (two servings), you will have taken in 500 calories. In addition to the total fat per serving, the label also tells you the calories from fat, so you can do a quick calculation in your head of what percentage of calories you are eating from fat. In the example, there are 135 calories from fat out of a total of 250 calories. You can see right away that more than half the calories in the soup come from fat. The label also tells you how much of the fat is saturated fat or trans fat.

“Total Carbohydrate” tells you, again, how much carbohydrate per serving. Keep in mind that this includes natural sources, such as the natural sugars in milk or fruit, so it’s not always easy to tell from the line labeled “Sugars” where the sugar is coming from without looking at the ingredients list. If a cereal has little added sugar–but contains raisins–the sugar content may look high, but it’s just from the natural fruit sugar.

Look at the ingredients list for sugar: sugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, beet sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, brown rice syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, high fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, maltodextrin, molasses, raw sugar, turbinado sugar and sucrose are all added sugars. Sometimes food manufacturers use a number of sweeteners in a product–each in small amounts–so the ingredients are “sprinkled” throughout the ingredients list, but taken together they can sometimes add up significantly.

Fiber and sugars are part of the total carbohydrate count. A food with 5 grams or more of fiber per serving is a good source of fiber.

% Daily Value:

Daily Values are standard values developed by the Food and Drug Administration for use on food labels. They are standards used to compare the amount of a nutrient  in a food to the amount that is recommended per day, but is based on a 2,000 calorie diet that may not apply to everyone. Even if you know that you don’t require that many calories, you can still look at these values to see if a particular food is high or low in a nutrient that you are interested in. In the example above, one serving of the soup provides

30 percent of the Daily Value for calcium, which is quite a bit. But it also has 25 percent of the Daily Value for fat–that means that one-fourth of the recommended fat for the day is packed into 1 cup of soup–that’s a lot of fat per serving!

Here are some things to visualize when you are looking  at a food label:

●          Every 5 grams of fat is a teaspoon of fat (or a pat of butter). In the example above, each cup serving of soup has 15 grams of fat–that’s three teaspoons (or one tablespoon), or three pats of butter per serving! If you consume the whole can (two servings), then you are consuming six pats of butter!

●          Every  4 grams of sugar is a teaspoon. The soup above has very little sugar–only 2 grams per serving, or about a half a teaspoon. But a 16 oz. bottle of sweetened tea might have 30 grams per serving (and remember, the bottle is two servings of 8 ounces each). If you drink the whole bottle,

you’ll be drinking 60 grams of sugar–that’s 15 teaspoons, or five tablespoons, or just under 1/3 cup!

THE SKINNY ON FATS

 By Susan Bowerman, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. 

The issue of dietary fat is probably one of the most confusing to people. Should you eat as little as possible? More of the “good” fats? The answer lies somewhere in between. Ideally, you want to eat only the amount that you need to add flavor to foods, and of the fats you eat, you want to select the healthiest ones. All fats, regardless of their source, are about 120 calories a tablespoon, so most people can’t (and shouldn’t) eat them freely. Here are some things to remember:

•     Fats are categorized  as saturated, polyunsaturated  or monounsatured, depending  on the predominant fatty acid they contain.

•     Generally speaking, saturated fats (found in animal products like meats, cheese and ice cream as well as hydrogenated vegetable oils) tend to raise blood  cholesterol  levels. The process of hydrogenating oils, which makes them harder at room temperature, produces trans-fatty acids– which also raise blood cholesterol and should be avoided.

•     Polyunsaturated fats can be “good” or “bad,” depending on whether they are primarily Omega-6 fats (which are pro-inflammatory) or Omega-3 fats (which are anti-inflammatory).

•     The richest source of Omega-6 fats in the American diet is corn oil; the richest sources of

Omega-3 fats in the American diet are fish, flaxseed and vegetables.

•     While small amounts of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are called “essential,” meaning our bodies can’t make them, the amounts required are very small and can be met from plant products, which have a good balance of the two fats.

•     Our diet is typically overloaded with Omega-6 fatty acids, with inadequate amounts of Omega-3.

This imbalance, with too many “bad” fats relative to “good” fats, promotes the inflammatory process which is believed to be at the root of asthma, heart disease and many common forms of cancer.

•     Monounsaturated fats, found in olive oil and avocado, have neutral effects on cholesterol and do not promote cancer. These fats are “healthy” fats and can be eaten in moderation.

•     Olive oil is a healthy oil for cooking; if the flavor is too strong for you, you can purchase “light” olive oils which have the same calories as regular olive oil, but are lighter in flavor.

To reduce overall fat intake:

•    Try using pan sprays when you sauté foods, or you can sauté in wine or broth.

•     Use nonfat or reduced-fat versions of high-fat items, such as dairy products, spreads and dressings.

•    If you are watching calories, keep in mind that low-fat or fat-free versions of baked goods often have the same amount of calories as the full-fat version. In many cases, fat is replaced with sugar which drives up the calories.

•    Avoid fatty meats such as steaks, high-fat ground meats, chops and sausages. Eat more poultry breast, fish, shellfish, egg whites, nonfat dairy products and soy products for protein, which have much less fat than red meats.

•     Avoid farmed salmon, if possible. Farmed salmon is fattier than wild salmon, but the extra fat it contains is not the “good” fat. Despite myths to the contrary, shellfish is not high in cholesterol, and is an excellent source of protein that is very low in fat.

•     Flavor foods with herbs, spices, lemon, onions, garlic, chiles and other seasonings rather than relying on heavy sauces, gravies and butter.

•     When you eat out, try to make smart choices. Keep sauces and gravies to a minimum, and order meats, fish or poultry grilled, broiled, poached, steamed, roasted or baked. Some people skip the starchy part of the meal, especially if it’s likely to be fatty, and order double vegetables instead.

•     Order salad dressing on the side so you can control how much you eat. Restaurants often drench the greens in high-fat dressings.

•    Try fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert rather than pastries and ice cream.

GOOD AND BAD FATS

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

OMEGA-3S AND OMEGA-6S

Of the many types of fatty acids, two that seem to be making  all the headlines these days are the Omega-3s and Omega-6s. These names simply describe the chemical structure of fats, but you only need to remember the Omega-3s tend to reduce inflammation in the body, while the Omega-6s tend to promote inflammation in the body. This is the most basic way to describe these two fatty acids. The Omega-3s are found in fish, flaxseed and borage oil, while the Omega-6s are found in corn and wheat. Nutritional anthropologists  believe that the diet of ancient women and men was relatively balanced between these two fats. Both are important, and a healthy ratio between the two determines health.

The Omega-3s are also found in ocean plants like seaweed algae. The fish eat the Omega 3-rich algae; the fish store the healthy fats; we eat the fish; and we store the healthy fats. Again, the phrase “you are what you eat” could never be more factual. The Omega-3s are also found in grass, which many animals naturally live on. Cows naturally eat the grass in the fields as they graze, they store the good fats, and we, in turn, get beef that is high in the good fats.

The change in the food supply has dramatically changed this process. Now most cows in the United States are corn fed to fatten them up faster for food production. This process is not what nature intended. So once again, we find a disruption of nature’s delicate balance.

MEAL SIZE MATTERS

 By Luigi Gratton, M.D., M.P.H. 

For many of us, one of the main goals of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is learning how to eat less. Part of the problem is that we don’t have a realistic idea of what constitutes a serving. In an era of jumbo meals, super-sizing and free refills, overgenerous portions of food and beverages have become the norm. In addition, eating habits that you learned from a young age–that it’s okay to have seconds, that you should clean your plate, that dessert always follows a meal–can be difficult to break. But difficult doesn’t mean impossible. You can train your body to feel full with less, just as it has become accustomed to needing more. Try these suggestions:

•     Serve meals already dished onto plates instead of placing serving bowls on the table. This allows you to think twice before having a second portion.

•     Try using a smaller plate or festive party bowl to make the food seem like more.

•     Eat slowly and savor each bite. When you eat too fast, your brain doesn’t get the signal that you’re full until too late and you’ve already overeaten.

•     Eat foods that are healthy and low in calories first. You can eat a lot of these foods without taking in a lot of calories. When at a party–hit the vegetable trays first.

•     When eating, focus on your meal and your company. Watching television, reading or working while you eat can distract you. Before you know it, you’ve eaten much more than you wanted to.

•     Stop eating as soon as you begin to feel full. Don’t feel as if you need to clean your plate.

•     Designate one area of the house to eat meals, such as the kitchen table, and sit to eat your meals.

•     If you’re still hungry after you’ve finished what’s on your plate, wait 20 minutes, mingle with other guests, and then if you are still hungry, nibble on something low in calories, such as fresh vegetables or fruit.

•     When ordering at a restaurant, request a take-home container. When you receive your meal, put part of it in the container. Or ask that one-half of your meal be put into a container before the meal is served. Portion sizes in restaurants can be two to three times the amount you need.

BE WISE TO PORTION SIZE

ONE SERVING IS EQUIVALENT TO:

One medium-size fruit (size of a tennis ball, your fist or a light bulb). Suggestions:

•     Wake up with an orange for breakfast

•     Add a sweet crunch to your lunch with an apple

•     A pear is a quick and easy dessert

½ cup cooked, frozen or canned vegetables or fruit (smaller than a can of tuna fish). Suggestions:

•     Grab some baby carrots for a snack

•     Order pizza with mushrooms, onions, peppers, broccoli or spinach–that’s more than one serving

•     Place sliced, canned peaches or berries on low-fat ice cream

1 cup of raw leafy vegetables (a handful  of greens counts as one serving). Suggestions:

•     Add a handful of baby spinach to your sandwich wrap

•     Have a mixed green salad with a slice of veggie-topped pizza for lunch

•     Keep washed greens in the fridge for a quick salad snack

½ cup cooked dry peas or beans (think smaller than a can of tuna fish again). Suggestions:

•     Add canned or frozen beans to vegetable soup

•     Make a salad with a variety of lima, red kidney or green beans, diced onions and Italian dressing

•     Toss pinto and garbanzo beans into a green salad

QUICK TIP: When dining out, here’s a new way of looking at those garnishes that make your plates so beautiful: Eat them. Try that orange slice and especially that green parsley. Not only is parsley nature’s best remedy to fresh breath, it’s naturally nutritious as well.

 QUIZ: PORTION DISTORTION 

Portion sizes–the amount of food we choose to eat for a meal or snack–have gotten larger over the years, and yet the standard serving sizes that are often referred to are much, much smaller. See how good you are at estimating portions, and also see how much our typical portions have grown over the years.

 ANSWER KEY: PORTION DISTORTION 

Portion sizes–the amount of food we choose to eat for a meal or snack–have gotten larger over the years, and yet the standard serving sizes that are often referred to are much, much smaller. See how good you are at estimating portions, and also see how much our typical portions have grown over the years.

Fresh Fruits and Vegetables

Try to purchase your fruits and vegetables locally and seasonally. For convenience, you can use precut carrots; prewashed salad greens and other vegetables; preshredded cabbage; chopped onions and garlic; and fresh-cut fruit.

LIGHTEN UP YOUR MEALS

YOUR WEEKLY CHALLENGE

There are two challenges this week. This first challenge is to try a new fruit or vegetable each week. Most of us eat the same foods day after day, and do our shopping almost mindlessly–buying the same things every week. If you like spinach, try another leafy green like kale, Swiss chard or turnip greens. If you eat oranges or apples, try deep-red blood oranges or a new apple variety. Instead of the usual white potato, try a sweet potato for a change. Fruits and vegetables each have their own unique health benefits, and a wider variety of fruits and vegetables is a great way to make improvements in the nutritional value of your diet.

The second challenge this week is to take a favorite recipe and “lighten it up.” Look at the table of ingredient substitutions below and see how they might work with your favorite recipe. Also look at the tips for cutting down on fat and calories during preparation. You might be surprised to find that you like the lighter version better.

INGREDIENT SUBSTITUTIONS FOR RECIPES

IF THE RECIPE CALLS FOR:    USE THIS INSTEAD:                                 COMMENTS:

Ground beef                            Ground turkey or chicken, or soy ground round

Spray pan with pan spray before browning; drain any fat from pan after browning. Soy ground round is already cooked.

Butter or margarine for baking

Applesauce; baby food prunes or carrots

You will need to experiment, but you can replace ½ or more of the fat in the recipe and get a nutritional boost.

Butter to sauté vegetables    Pan spray; broth, wine, vegetable juice

Spray pan with pan spray; sauté in wine, broth or vegetable juice. Cover pan to “sweat” vegetables.

Cheese                                 Reduced-fat cheese                             Use reduced-fat cheese, and reduce the total amount in the recipe if possible.

 Cream (not for whipping) Evaporated nonfat milk;fat-free half-and-half Evaporated nonfat milk can be used in recipes and in coffee. Eggs in baking Egg whites or egg substitutes Egg substitutes are 99% egg white; you can also use two egg whites to replace one whole egg in baking. Mayonnaise Nonfat mayonnaise Nuts Use less Reduce amount by half, and toast first to enhance flavor. 

Pie crust                                Graham-cracker crust                          Traditional pie crust is very high in fat and saturated fat;

graham crackers are whole grain.

Sour cream, cream cheese,  Use nonfat versions; plain nonfat

Try whirling cottage cheese in the blender with a little lemon juice;

cottage cheese

yogurt can replace sour cream

it makes a smooth, creamy sour cream substitute.

TASTEFUL TIPS

•     Use pan sprays regularly. Spray the pan when it is cold, then place over the flame. You can reduce fat considerably by taking this first step. Once the pan is hot, you can add a small amount of healthy olive oil for flavor.

•     Replace refined starches with whole grain: Try brown rice, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat bread and crackers, whole-wheat cous-cous, and oatmeal instead of cream of wheat. You can buy quick- cooking brown rice that can be ready in 15 minutes.

•     Add diced vegetables to soups, chili, meat loaf, casseroles, tuna or chicken salad and pasta sauce to reduce overall calories and boost nutrition.

•     Season steamed vegetables with lemon, vinegar, herbs, garlic, onion and spices rather than relying on butter or sauces.

•     Add fruits to salad for a change. Try fresh orange or tangerine sections, apples or kiwi. Use deep- green leafy vegetables, instead of iceberg lettuce, for more nutrition.

•     Frozen vegetables and fruits are just as nutritious and fresh, may be less expensive, and allow you to eat foods that might not be in season any time of the year. For example, loose-leaf frozen spinach or chopped vegetables can easily be added to soups and stews.

•     Take advantage of the healthy convenience items such as prewashed salad greens, precut fruit and baby carrots. They may cost more, but if you keep buying fruits and vegetables and throwing them away because you don’t take time to prepare them, it may be less expensive in the long run. If your market has a salad bar, you can buy prewashed, precut vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms, cauliflower and carrots, which you can take home and steam or stir-fry.

•     Visit a local farmer’s market. The produce is usually much fresher than what you find in the supermarkets, which means vegetables won’t wilt as quickly and the foods retain their nutritional value. You can find new varieties of fruits and vegetables to try, and you will be eating foods that are in season.

•     You can thicken soups without added butter, flour or cream. Place some of the broth and vegetables in the blender and then stir back into the soup. Or, make your own “cream” soups by cooking vegetables with broth, onions, garlic and seasoning–then puree it all in the blender with a little evaporated nonfat milk or soft tofu for a delicious creamy soup.

•     Try different mustards and vinegars for seasoning salads and vegetables without fat.

•     Double the recipe for dishes that freeze well, such as soups, stews, and casseroles. That way, when you’re tired and don’t want to cook, you can pull something healthy from the freezer rather than pulling into the drive-through.

•     You’ve heard it many times, but don’t shop when you are hungry. It’s too tempting to pick up the wrong foods. Make a list and stick to it, for the most part, but be flexible.

•     Supermarkets are carefully laid out to tempt you–so don’t get tempted by the candy at the checkout.

Also, studies show that people who buy large containers of foods tend to serve themselves more from those containers, so try to keep portion sizes consistent if you buy economy-sized packages.

RECIPE REDO

Here’s an example of how you can give your recipes a makeover for healthier results. Make sure to experiment with your recipes at home.

This Shrimp Rice Casserole is real comfort food, and with a tossed salad and fruit for dessert, it makes a great dinner. But as with many one-dish meals, the original is loaded with fat–items such as butter, cheese and condensed soups. The original recipe called for ½ cup of butter, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and 2 cups (8 ounces) of shredded cheddar cheese.

The strategies for improving the nutritional value of the dish included reducing the cheese by half, reducing the fat from 8 tablespoons down to 2 (and replacing the butter with heart-healthy olive oil), and making a simple mushroom sauce to replace the canned soup which is loaded with fat and sodium. An additional nutritional boost was made by substituting brown rice for white. You could also add some cooked broccoli florets to this dish for a true one-dish meal.

HEALTHY BREAKFAST

Feel Good and Control Your Weight

CARBS-BASED BREAKFAST

In  the  morning,  simple  carbohydrates (e.g., sugary refined cereals, white breads, toasts, etc.) cause an immediate surge of blood sugar levels, which results in the release of a substantial amount of insulin. The insulin removes sugar from the blood and puts it into storage, primarily in fat tissue. The result is a decreased level of blood

sugar and a thirst for more carbs. This cycle repeats itself two to three more times during the day. When blood sugars drop quickly, we often look for something sweet to bring the levels back up. If this happens enough times during the day, we could end up snacking too much and taking in too many calories.

SKIPPING BREAKFAST

When you skip  breakfast, blood  sugar drops below  the  normal  level,  and  you experience cravings and a drop in energy. You again revert to simple carbohydrates to achieve a quick surge of blood sugar and to overcome hunger and a drop in energy. Simple carbohydrates will cause an immediate  surge of blood sugar levels  and a

substantial insulin emission. The insulin removes sugar from blood turning its excess into fat. Then this cycle repeats itself two to three more times during the day. This vicious cycle constitutes one of the major reasons for diabetes, high blood pressure and extra weight.

✓ BALANCED PROTEIN-BASED BREAKFAST

Such a breakfast supplies our body with all vital nutrients and energy without  increasing blood sugar and insulin levels. It helps to avoid dependence on carbs during the day. In this way, appetite stays under control, cravings for carbs (e.g., snacks, chocolate, pastry, soft drinks, etc.)

diminish, and the body uses its own stored fats to get more energy.

Note: The sugar-/insulin-response curves are schematic illustrations of a known physiological reaction.

The exact science behind it is complex and varies for different people.

Week 3: Metabolism

REV UP YOUR METABOLISM

Put your metabolism to work for you. Now’s the perfect time to incorporate some metabolic-revving tips into your daily regimen and avoid gaining weight.

REV UP YOUR BODY’S ENGINE

We eat food for fuel. When we burn it for energy to run our bodies, the process creates heat. Nutritional supplements can assist the body’s engine to burn fuel efficiently, helping our metabolism stay revved and functioning well.

DAILY REGIMEN TIPS

Keep your metabolism revved with these tips:

•     Engage in 30 minutes of activity every day to help minimize weight gain and to raise metabolic rate.

•     Tone your muscles by weight training three days a week.

•     Start small–try walking with one- to two-pound weights.

•     Do not eat fewer than 1,200 calories a day. Eating too little may slow your metabolism.

•     Never skip breakfast. It may slow down your metabolism.

•     Nutritional supplements, such as Herbalife’s Total Control®  and Herbal Tea Concentrate, can help boost metabolism.*

•     Have a supply of protein-powered healthy snacks on hand as an alternative to carb-loaded junk food.

METABOLISM: TRUTHS AND MYTHS

 By Susan Bowerman, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. 

We hear a lot about metabolism–and often blame our “slow metabolism” for our inability to keep our weight under control. But what is metabolism, exactly? And is there anything we can do to change our metabolic rate?

Metabolism basically refers to all the chemical processes that take place in the body in order to sustain life–allowing you to breathe, pump blood, keep your brain functioning and extract energy from your food. When you hear the term metabolic rate –more accurately called basal (or resting ) metabolic rate –that refers to the number of calories your body at rest uses each day, just to keep all your vital organs functioning. You burn additional calories through your daily activities and formal exercise, but by far, the majority of the calories that you burn each day are your basal calories.

The number of calories that you burn every day is directly related to your body composition. Think of your body as divided into two compartments.  In one compartment is all the body fat; in the other compartment is everything that isn’t fat (e.g., bone, fluid, tissue, muscle)–that’s the fat-free compartment. The size of your fat-free compartment determines your metabolic rate, with every pound of fat-free mass burning about 14 calories per day.

If you weigh 150 pounds and 50 pounds of you is fat and 100 pounds is fat-free, then you would burn about 1,400 calories per day at rest. If you don’t get much activity, you won’t burn much more than this throughout the day. But if you weigh 150 pounds and 25 pounds of you is fat, and 125 pounds of you is fat free, then you burn 1,750 calories per day at rest. And if you get some regular exercise and burn a few hundred calories more per day, your total calorie burn for the day might be 2,000 calories!

Since the fat-free compartment contains muscle tissue, one of the best things you can do to boost your metabolic rate is to strength-train to increase your muscle mass. If you build up 10 pounds of lean body mass, that’s another 140 extra calories that you burn per day–not to mention the calories that you burn through exercise.

METABOLISM: TRUTHS AND MYTHS (CONTINUED)

Here are a few truths and myths about metabolism:

MYTH: AGING SLOWS YOUR METABOLISM.

Truth: People do tend to put on weight as they get older, but it isn’t inevitable. People have a tendency to exercise less, or less vigorously, as they age–and that means fewer calories burned per day. As activity levels and intensity go down, loss of muscle mass can occur. This then shrinks the body’s fat-free compartment and leads to a lower metabolic rate. Cardiovascular  exercise will burn calories, and resistance training to preserve or build up muscle are great defenses against age-related weight gain.

MYTH: YOU’RE STUCK WITH THE METABOLISM YOU HAVE, AND YOU CAN’T CHANGE IT. Truth: We all seem to know people who can “eat whatever they want and never gain weight” or those who “just look at food and put on 10 pounds.” But lifestyle plays a big part in determining the calories you burn per day. While it may appear that there are people who eat all the time and never seem to gain, chances are they make healthy, relatively low-calorie selections naturally. And many of these people burn more calories through what is called Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)–basically, they move around a lot during the day. They might fidget more, get up from their desks frequently during the day to stretch, or walk down the hall to talk to a colleague instead of emailing. Next time you’re in a public place–say a coffeehouse–become an observer. You may notice that heavier people sit very still and hardly move. Leaner people may use more hand gestures, or wiggle a foot or a crossed leg. The point is, build more muscle and then use it by moving around more throughout the day.

MYTH: EATING A GRAPEFRUIT WITH MY MEAL WILL SPEED UP MY METABOLISM. Truth: There’s nothing special about grapefruit that will speed up your metabolism. Sometimes it’s recommended that you should eat half a grapefruit with each meal for this purpose. But the reason this may work is not because of anything magical about grapefruit. It’s simply a watery, low-calorie food that takes up space in the stomach that might normally be taken up by higher-calorie foods. It may help weight loss, but it doesn’t have any effect on your metabolism.

MYTH: IF I CUT CALORIES, MY METABOLIC RATE WILL SLOW DOWN, SO WHAT’S THE POINT OF EXERCISING?

Truth: It is true that your metabolic rate can slow a bit when you cut calories. After all, your body’s natural inclination will be to try to conserve calories as best it can. But these decreases are relatively small, and if people become more active as they lose weight, this can offset these small changes. By dieting and

exercising, you can help to preserve the rate at which your body burns calories.

POWER YOUR METABOLISM WITH PROTEIN

Your muscle mass works like a furnace, burning calories and stored fat for energy. The more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism, the faster you burn calories. Eating plenty of protein daily is essential

to maintaining your muscle mass for good health, energy and effective weight management.
