 www.TellPopeyes.com – Popeyes Customer Survey 

Posted on 25 November 2010. Tags: customer survey , popeyes customer survey , survey , tellpopeyes 
 
This is a customer survey website for Popeyes, the second largest fried chicken producer in the world. It was founded in 1972 with the birth of a fast food restaurant Chicken on the Run. And then changed its name into Popeyes and expanded its business globally. Till 1985 there were more than 500 franchise store in the world putting the brand on the global catering lists. Later it became partner of America’s Favorite Chicken Company, which now known as AFC Enterprise Inc.

Popeyes Chicken&amp;Biscuits are well acclaimed and many kids and youngster like the leisure food and fast food under its brand. It has opened a branch is Beijing as early as 1999, when fried chicken was still a new favorite among the kids. And again in 2003, Popeyes went to Beijing to find suitable investors to expand its influence in China.

Originally the name of this company came from the cartoon series, Popeye, the Sailor Man, which was very popular in 1980 with it humorous and adventurous elements to cater to the needs of kids. Frankly speaking, Popeye the Sailor Man is still one of my favorite cartoon series, and the other three of my favorite cartoons are Saint Seiya, Secret Garden and The Smurfs. At the second year of the debut of this cartoon series, the number of its chain stores reached as many as 500. Now it owns near 1800 stores in the world

When Elzie Segar creative the serialized caricature Popeye the Sailor Man in 1929, a real Popeye appeared in the town of Louisiana. Popeyes Chicken&amp;Biscuits is claimed to be more delicious compared with KFC or Church’s Chicken. Its spicy flavor is unparalleled in the fast food circle and has won the favor of most people in South America. It serves fried chicken, salad, biscuit, bread, potato chip and soft drink, and there is ample choice in terms of its sauce packages. And the famous Korean comedian Zhang Nala has shoot advertising promo for Popeyes.

This time, Popeyes has launched a lucky draw for its consumers with the attraction of iPod and 1000 dollars cash prize. Now it has become partner of Louisiana Kitchen with its powerful influence in the fast food industry. The promotional activity is a kind of reward to the loyal consumers and also hype for its expansive coverage in the world. I don’t like fast food at all. As a traditional Chinese, I’d rather try porridge or noodles instead of hamburgers and fried chickens. I don’t hate fast food, but I just don’t like the way they are cooked. And in the fast moving world, I prefer to be a vegetarian keeping away from all kind of meat.
