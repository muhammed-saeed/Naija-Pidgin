 FOOD REVIEW : Burger King introduces the Fire-Grilled Rib. Is it better than the McRib?

By REVIEWniverse staff

 How many of you ran out to Burger King the minute you saw the commercial for this?

There&apos;s a group of foodies who run to their cars, hop on a subway or grab the earliest train the minute they see a commercial for a fast food restaurant that&apos;s introducing a new item. And by a group of people we mean Robbie, Kenny, Bill and Harlan. We&apos;re talking food here, not the new &quot;Sex and the City&quot; action figures (that would be Bill and Harlan). We did it for White Castle&apos;s BBQ slider, Jack in the Box&apos;s (best place, hands down) new grilled breakfast sandwich, KFC&apos;s &quot;Doubledown,&quot; and Taco Bell&apos;s Shrimp Taco. The one we most risked whiplash for was the McRib, from McDonalds. The McRib was a cheesy (as in so bad it&apos;s good; not mozzarella), 150-percent processed mystery meat product slathered in BBQ sauce, onions and pickles, on a hero roll. In other words: the best awful food ever.

Now, Burger King has joined the rib fray (It was probably that creepy king&apos;s idea) and the minute we heard about it, we were on the road. Setting up our test kitchen in the car as soon as we were handed the steaming bag, we had no idea what to expect.

First off, at Burger king, there is meat on the bones (no bones in the McRib, because it is created from pseudo meat. The BK ribs, about an inch and a half big, live up to their name--they are smoky and grill-fired. And, they are actually not terrible. They are seasoned BK style (lots of salt) and they&apos;re dry (no sauce). If you dip them in the BK BBQ sauce, both the ribs and the sauce taste better. They come in a 3- 6- or 8-pack, and the 6-pack was actually enough. A few were fatty, but most were filled with well-done meat (our lab says it&apos;s pork) that were soon stripped completely off the bone.

Although they were good, we will never order them again. Why would we order ribs at BK when we could get a burger to satisfy a fast-food flame-grilled craving? But you know what, I sit at the edge of my chair anytime a McDonald&apos;s commercial comes on, just waiting for them to announce the return of the McRib. One quick call to Bill and Harlan, and we&apos;re there.

If only:

 

 IN OTHER WORDS : Better isn&apos;t always better.

 BK FIRE-GRILLED RIBS RATING : 7.7/10

 McRIB RATING : -7.7/10, but better

 THE CREEPY BURGER KING RATING : 2/10
