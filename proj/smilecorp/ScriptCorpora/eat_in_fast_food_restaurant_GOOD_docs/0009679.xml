 Nyonya Colors 
 Posted on July 7, 2012 by liyenz Reply 
 
I wanted to eat the Yong Tau Foo at the lower ground of The Gardens Mall but it is always packed with people during the lunch time. So, I opted for next option, the Nyonya Colors , which is located few steps away from the Yong Tau Foo stall.

While queueing for my turn to place order, I kept looking at their menu. I am a bit curious to know what Yellow Laksa (Thai) is .  Its name sounds special, so without any hesitation, I ordered this noodle.

It consists of thick curry laksa with vermicelli, some chicken and few white radish. I felt it is a bit odd to have white radish inside a curry noodle. The overall taste is good but it is a bit oily and the rest is just normal.

 Purple Cane Tea House 
 Posted on July 1, 2012 by liyenz 1 
Besides just having a cuppa of tea, you can try their food too. There are few dishes that I quite like it during my previous visits. 

 Nasi Lemak with curry chicken 
The rice is cooked with tea leaves and the curry always tastes nice especially the potatoes.
 
 

Another good try is the mushroom chicken noodle or you can order rice as well. It uses the flat yellow mee. The noodle looks oily to me after mixed with the black-mushroom sauce.
 
It seems like the rice set is better presentation that the noodle one.
 

I tried the vegetarian goose noodle and it is one of my favourite vegetarian food but it is very oily because of the fried vegetarian goose. However, this crispy vegetarian goose goes well with the dried flat yellow noodle.
 

 Black Tea Chicken Rice
 Same as the Nasi Lemak set, the rice is cooked with tea leaves. The chicken breast is quite generous. Hope it is still the same now.
 

 Lemon Chicken Rice 
 

All the above sets come with a glass of cold drink or hot tea of your choice.

 Reminisce 
 Posted on June 17, 2012 by liyenz Reply 
 Reminisce means indulge in enjoyable recollection of past events. Yes, this restaurant’s setting is based on the collections of old stuff that we used before during our childhood days. Perhaps, many of us might have forgotten all these small stuff. Here is some of the pictures that I took during my visit.
 
 
It is located at ground floor, Mid Valley, nearby the Boulevard Hotel. So, next time when you plan for old-mates gathering can consider this restaurant too.

As for food comments, please continue read…

 Butter Chicken Rice Set 
Suggested by my colleague to try this butter chicken rice. So, I ordered the set which consisted of the main course, a drink and a dessert. No disappointment. It is nice butter chicken with a sambal egg. The sauce or gravy is enough taste.
 

 Reminisce Bento
 Bento that consists of many different small snacks such as chee cheung fun, satay, spring rolls, crispy stuffed“yau zha guai”, fish balls and fried chicken. From my own opinion, it is not a good pick for its price.

 Shihlin Taiwan 
 Posted on June 9, 2012 by liyenz Reply 
If you want to try out the giant size of crispy fried chicken , you do not have to go as far as Taiwan, you can find it at Shilin Taiwan Street Snack . The shop is located at many places around KL, Selangor and other states in Malaysia.

I tried this Happy! Ricebox Set. It consisted of a XXL crispy fried chicken , cut and spread on top of the white rice, accompanying with smooth cold tofu topped with diced century egg. On top of that, they put some oyster sauce and some spring onions on top. It is a good combination of hot and cold dish. 
 

This ricebox set comes with a drink, you can choose between the V-Soy soya bean milk drink or mineral water.
 

This is how the whole set looks like. Do not look down at its portion. I do feel full after finishing it because of the soya bean milk which is quite filling after drinking it.

 Sunflower Brasserie 
 Posted on June 2, 2012 by liyenz 1 
I have some backlog of unpublished entries for this restaurant called, Sunflower Brasserie which is located at the Royale Bintang Hotel, Kuala Lumpur.

 Fish and Chips
 The fish fillets looked slightly bigger pieces than before this. It gave us 2 big pieces. I still love the fish and chip in Brisbane and Perth! Yayahh…
 
We were served by this tall Malay guy who suggested to us to try the Mamak style fried noodle (RM22) when we ordered the fried noodle. The portion is quite generous and the taste is acceptable, just that it is a bit oily when fried with kuay teow.

 

However, when we went there again on our third visit and ordered the same Mamak style fried kuay teow, the portion was reduced.

 

So from its presentation, is it different chefs who cooked this noodle?

We also ordered another fried noodle. This one I felt we were cheated. It is Vegetarian fried noodle (RM21) and its price at the menu was RM18.00 but when the bill came, it showed the price as RM21.00. We asked the waiter, he said the price has increased and the menu has not updated but system has updated. How can it be? It is cheating consumers.
 
Still, the portion is small.

 Penang Assam Laksa 
 Posted on May 26, 2012 by liyenz 2 
During my trip to Penang Island in April, 2012, I insisted to go back to the same stall to have my Penang Assam Laksa. I brought my aunt to this stall to taste this great Assam Laksa. It is located opposite of the Air Itam wet market and not far away from the Kek Lok Si. If you are going to visit the temple (Kek Lok Si), do stop by to try this noodle.

The amount of ingredients is pretty generous for a bowl of noodle priced RM3.50. They gave a lot of the shredded mackerel, as you can see from the picture. When you mix it with the thick round rice noodle and the prawn paste, it made a perfect mixture. The aroma  of the lemon grass is strong too and the taste is perfectly good, at least it is better than some other food courts out there.
 
 

Do look for this signboard and stall setup if you are unsure where is this stall located. I am sure you cannot miss it.

 Luk Yu Tea House 
 Posted on May 12, 2012 by liyenz 1 
After tried their dim sum selections, we went back to the same restaurant to try other food from the menu. Coincidently, they were having promotions during our visit where we could order their rice and noodle selections with reduced prices. Of course, the portion was small than its usual one but it is good to try since we wanted to try many different food.

 Yang Chow Fried Rice 
Simple fried rice, enough taste and not too dry. The portion that they gave us was enough for two bowl.
 

 Fried Kuay Teow with Beef and Fried Loh Shu Fun 
 This fried kuay teow may look small portion but it is quite delicious and it tasted better than the fried loh shu fun below. The ingredients included the sliced of beef, bean sprouts and egg.
 
And this fried loh shu fun looked quite delicious too but still not enough taste. I did not know whether it was because I ate the fried kuay teow first, then I found this noodle not enough taste. However, it gave quite a lot of ingredients which include minced meat, bean sprouts and kau choi.
 

 Fish Head Noodle 
Another good try was their fish head noodle. I liked the fish head soup with milk. It is very delicious. It gave few slices of the fish meat with some tomatoes, ham choi and fried onions. It always go well with rice vermicelli.
