 GASTONIA, North Carolina (AP) -- A woman who said she found blood smeared inside her container of french fries is suing McDonald&apos;s Corp. for at least $10,000.

Lora Davis, 42, said she was down to the last several french fries that came with her Happy Meal when she noticed the blood.

&quot;At first, I felt disbelief,&quot;she said.&quot;Then fear.&quot;

Davis bought the meal at a McDonald&apos;s in Gastonia, North Carolina, on November 26, 2004, and ate it at her office desk.

When she found the blood, she said, she called the fast-food restaurant and spoke with an apologetic assistant manager. The person later called back and said the blood came from an employee who had suffered a cut, she said.

A regional manager later told Davis the unidentified employee had been fired, she said.

A county health inspector, John Carpenter, said he spoke to the restaurant manager, who confirmed Davis&apos; account of the incident.

Carpenter wrote in a letter last August that he instructed the restaurant manager on how to handle the situation if a food preparer had cuts on fingers or hands.

The county Health Department did not take any action against the restaurant, spokeswoman Shannon Clubb said.

Davis said she went to her doctor to be tested for infectious diseases and was under the impression that McDonald&apos;s would pay for her medical bills. When she didn&apos;t hear back from the company for months, she filed a lawsuit February 3 in Gaston County Superior Court.

An attorney for Davis said attempts to reach an out-of-court settlement have been fruitless so far.

A McDonald&apos;s official declined to comment because the legal claim is pending.

Davis said she continues to have her blood tested, though she has not suffered any illness. She said she stopped eating out for six or seven months.

&quot;I get sick when I think about it,&quot;she said.

 Seriously, how many permutations of suing a fast food chain are there going to be? __________________

Posts: 1,062 Re: Woman sues McDonalds over bloody HappyMeal I do think they should pay for her medical bills, because I think if you come in contact with foreign blood you probably should get tested. But I sincerely doubt all the tests came up to $10,000. __________________

I&apos;m not usually the law suit happy type but I can&apos;t blame her. I cannot think of anything much more disturbing than possibly consuming the blood of some McDonald&apos;s worker along with your food. Don&apos;t doubt it would give you the willies about eating and possibly trigger post tramatic stress disorder. They need to at least pick up her medical tests but really should give her something for the disgust and eww factor. They fucked up.

People get cut at work and in the rush of working at a fast food restaurant, maybe a minor cut wasn&apos;t noticed or there wasn&apos;t time to deal with it. I used to work in restaurants and sometimes there isn&apos;t much to do other than slap a bandaid on it and move on. And sometimes the cut would be bad enough for blood to leak out. Certainly the medical bills should be paid for by McDonalds but really, life is not incident free and I am really sick of people suing over any damn thing that happens to them. Get over it. Life ain&apos;t fair and the sooner you learn that, the better off you&apos;ll be. __________________

 Well you do have a point there. Anyone eating there regularly probably isn&apos;t deserving of much sympathy.

I dont agree on the costs, but I think she&apos;s exagerating a little and she could eat any where and still have the change of finding a finger in her food. __________________
