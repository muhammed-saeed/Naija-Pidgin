 Middlefield: Guida’s Restaurant 
 – May 24, 2010 Posted in: All , Food 
Guida’s Restaurant is a classic drive-in eatery. The fast food restaurant serves homemade hot dogs with a choice of toppings and grilled split-top rolls, burgers, milkshakes, and perfect fries. Proudly no-frills, the diner has a few tables indoors, an ice cream window, and several picnic tables under the trees outside.

Near the intersection of I-91 and I-691 and situated squarely in the 1950s, a statue of Betty Boop welcomes diners for classic car nights and the menu warns,“No Drunks, No Burnouts.”Maybe that’s why breakfast is served only during breakfast hours?
