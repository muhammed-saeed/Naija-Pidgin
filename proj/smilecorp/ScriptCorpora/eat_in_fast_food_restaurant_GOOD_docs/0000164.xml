I pick here over any other fast food place hands down! The food is way better and it&apos;s really cheap! The  milkshakes are awesome! I love that they have BBQ sandwiches and hushpuppies! The plates are the best deal around,&amp;my husband loves that chicken nuggets are a side!

I don&apos;t frequent the Richmond area often, but when I do I love to stop by Cookout for cheap, satisfying, fill-me-up food. Located downtown Richmond -- not too far from VCU - this joint offers a variety of foods: burgers, hushpuppies, and coleslaw (oh my!), amongst other tasty snacks: corndogs, fries, milkshakes, wraps, quesadillas, onion rings.... you feel my drift? If you&apos;re looking for something quick and tasty bypass Chick-fil-a, Burger King, and yes, even McDonalds, and head to this fast-food joint right off Broad street.

Pros:
-Dirt-cheap! Seriously, you can order a meal (one entrée and two sides PLUS drink) for under $5.00. If you would like to upgrade your soft drink to a milkshake it&apos;s only a dollar more.
-Satisfying. Okay, okay, it&apos;s not a five star restaurant or even your local Friday&apos;s. IT&apos;S a fast food &quot;restaurant&quot; so please don&apos;t expect service to be swift or your food to be cooked by a 4 star chef. IT IS WHAT IT IS -- a college town&apos;s local late night joint. That being said, I guarantee it will hit the spot after a late night of drinking, smoking, or whatever else you&apos;ve been getting yourself into.
-There are over 20 different milkshakes from chocolate cherry to blueberry all under $3.00

Cons:
In reality there really are no cons. I have read reviews complaining about the quality of the food, service, and even the establishment itself. But you get what you pay for, and when a dozen of hushpuppies are .99 cents there really isn&apos;t too much to bitch about.

What&apos;s not to love about a hotdog wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese? nothing!

Cook-out, is as it suggest...a place with cook out food!

I&apos;d recommend a milkshake to all those rolling through.

The place is really awesome...cheap food and great quality

My brother and i stumbled on this place while on a random visit to richmond. a few friends had mention this place just because it had just opened. When we drove up there was a line so you gotta assume if there is a line its gotta be good. We both ordered cook out tray&apos;s  which gives you a choice of a sandwich and 2 sides and a large drink.
I got a BBQ (Char-grilled)Chicken Sandwich(BBQ Sauce, Fresh Sliced Pickles, Mayo), with hush puppies and coleslaw and my brother got  a regular  1/4 burger with a  bacon wrap and fries. It was about 9.00 bucks to feed the 2 of us are u kidding?  and it comes with a large drink...it was crazy.  I can&apos;t even find that  anywhere in nova that would give me that price it&apos;s usually 9.00 to feed one of us.  Definitely coming back   to this place to get a quick bite when i&apos;m in richmond.

Plus where are you going to find a place that gives you lettuce wrapped bacon?

All of these other reviews are laughable, at best.  Honestly, you are reviewing a &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant.  Of course it&apos;s not going to be a fine dining experience.  For this being Virginia&apos;s first location, and having a property lot that is confining to how their drive thru path works, they have an ample staff that is capable of pumping out food as quickly as humanly possible.  Naturally, mistakes are going to happen when you&apos;re serving quite close to 100 cars every hour.

The vast menu offers something for everyone, and as all the other reviews suggested, their prices are quite nearly unbeatable.  The burgers stomp out McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, and even Wendy&apos;s. Hands down.  To compare this to Five-Guys, the quality of the burger might not be quite on that par, but you&apos;re also not spending 5-6$ on JUST the burger alone.  The combination of the low price, and it being nearly the best FAST FOOD option available in the West End, it&apos;s no wonder they have a line 15 cars deep going down the road in front of Kroger.

After having a chance earlier this week to go to In-N-Out, the gold standard of burger joints in my humble opinion, I am just not a fan of this place. I have gone here three times. Come on, all those cars lining up must mean this place is great, right?

- Bad idea on the design and location. The owners should take a trip out the California and see how In-N-Out designed their drive-through path. I am sure the owners never expected the attention nor the lines of cars they are experiencing right now. It may diminish as the novelty wears off or people realize the burgers are what does yelp say: Meh...

- The first cheeseburger I ordered about a week after they opened was not bad. The second burger was about as moist as a hockey puck, the last one I ordered tasted of lighter fluid.

- Menu has WAY too many items. It is overwhelming, impossible to read, and seems like they are trying to please everybody with everything. I just want a cheeseburger. If I wanted a BBQ sandwich I would go to TD&apos;s or Extra Billy&apos;s, if I wanted chicken nuggets I would go to McDonald&apos;s. Come on...hush puppies and corn dogs?

I hope Cook-Out is just going through growing pains.

Talk about a lot of bang for your buck!!!

I got a corndog here (because I was too drunk to read the rest of the menu and remembered that someone mentioned corndogs earlier) and hushpuppies and a milk shake all for about $4.50. WHAAATTTT?!?!?!?! Seriously?!?!?! Now that&apos;s a lot of value for your money!!! Granted the food was just pretty good but that was probably my fault because I should&apos;ve gotten something other than a corndog.

Why is this place so awesome?? Because the milkshakes are delicious, the food is cheap and you can get things like corndogs and quesadillas as SIDES. That&apos;s right, SIDES! (Probably contributing to the obesity problem in America, but it&apos;s not like people eat here every day. OK, scratch that... so it&apos;s not like MOST of us eat here every day.)

Cookout is awesome. :-)

Ok...so I&apos;m reading all these reviews and I must have really struck out at this place.

The food was...uhh...OK.  It reminded me of cafeteria food back in middle and highschool.

The 99 cent hush puppies were gross and small and had little to no flavor at all.

The burger was good...when I was drunk and hungry.

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING reminded me of going to a &quot;cook-out&quot;

I love good food but I also have a taste for greasy, delicious fast food...and this place is not good. at all.

Yes, you caught me, I am a fatty and a total food stalker. Yes, the delicious taste of vinegary pulled pork, fresh cole slaw, and milk shakes with super fresh-tasting fruit left a food memory that lasted for six years or more from the time I first tried Cook-Out by chance on a family road trip in NC until the moment I saw that red and black sign pop up earlier this week.  And yes, my heart jumped for joy and I OMG&apos;d big time, texting every food lover I knew as soon as I saw the Cook-Out sign.  Did I vow to be in line the first day?  Sure did!  I passed by around 8 tonight and noticed that they were up and ready for their first day today,New Years Eve, with a steady flow of people who knew exactly what was up when they saw that Cook-Out sign.  Did I stop in?  How could I not?!

So why all the hype about a fast food joint, Kristen?  I thought you didn&apos;t even like fast food.  You&apos;re exactly right, but Cook-Out is far from your average fast food joint.  They serve around 21 delicious milkshake flavors (2.29) ranging from strawberry to pineapple to peanut butter banana to blueberry and everything in between, they serve delicious BBQ, the Cole slaw is super fresh, the hush puppies have the perfect crunch and lean just slightly on the sweet with a hint of onion, the burgers have that delicious family cookout charcoal taste I love, and the price is right.  For just over two bucks, you get a dlishious pulled pork sandwich and four bucks gets you a combo of pulled pork, slaw, hush puppies, and fries.  Where else can you get homemade taste at price?  Yet another plus--they serve all pulled pork topped Texas Pete!  HEllo!  These people know what they&apos;re doing!

So, the question left, then, is did Richmond&apos;s new Cook-Out stack up to what I had in NC six years ago or more?  OH YES!  A good food memory never lies!  if you&apos;re wondering about that peanut butter banana milkshake, just go for it!  It&apos;s amazing!  It&apos;s thick and creamy peanut-buttery goodness with soft bits of fresh and tasty banana.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  The pulled pork, slaw, and hush puppies were all amazing just like before.  It beats ketchupy VA style BBQ any day!

On top of meeting my uber high expectations in terms of food, they have the best customer service of any fast food joint ive ever seen!  I&apos;m talking kicking the pants off sit-down restaurants.  All I have to say is long live the South and long live Cook-Out!

Mmmm... A hot dog, hush puppies and a Dr Pepper. I can feel my arteries closing up, but I don&apos;t even care.

As an out-of-towner, I feel robbed that there isn&apos;t a Cook-Out anywhere near me.  I mean, the place had chicken strips as a side.  A SIDE!

The newest InRich rave &apos;Cookout&apos; so that was todays lunch....and....and...

4 out of 5 stars!  Had the Cajun Chicken sandwich and though lacking enough cajun flaovr like Popeye&apos;s original chhicken it was grilled nicely.  The chick was tender, delicious and juicy like I like to eat all my chick and hot.

The onion rings were good however my double order was more like a single order.

$4.66 for a good samwhich, 2-sides and a pop (cookout tray) is the lowest fast, tasty food stop in town.

Just pay attention to the traffic and lengthy lines but it moves swiftly.

Ok, the most important thing to remember about this place is that there is NO ordering line, you must be in a car for drive thru only.   So if you have no problem with that, expect the wait to be a long time during busy hours.  I went at 2:30pm and my line still have 6 cars in front of me.   With that said, you do get your food very fast as soon as you drive up to the window.
Now the food,  the price is very good for what you get and that&apos;s a bonus for someone like me who&apos;s trying to cut down on eating out expenses.  The selections of different milkshakes is amazing.

I did not get the burgers this time as I wanted to try the bbq plate first.  which in my opinion is average like most places.  but that&apos;s just me, I was spoiled by this one place which doesn&apos;t exist anymore and I prefer a different style of bbq compare to Carolina&apos;s.

The milkshake that I got, Banana berries is exceptional.  it is a diet killer for sure.   I will definitely go back again and give the burger a try next time.  and a different flavor milkshake as soon as figure out my jogging schedule.

Their food is alright.  It&apos;s super cheap, though, so you kinda get what you pay for.  What sucks is that the wait is ridiculous.  With two drive-thru lanes going AND a walk-up window, you will still wait something like 20 minutes in line.

However, I really love their milkshakes.  They are delicious!  And sorta more like ice cream, because the consistency is so thick.  Oreo mint is my favorite, it&apos;s perfect on these hot summer days.

YEEEEEEEEEEEEES.

$0.99 corn dogs.

$0.99 for 12 hush puppies- delicious hush puppies.

$2.39 for a thick creamy milkshake in one of 39 flavors.  Like Heath Bar.  It has real bits of Heath Bar in it.  YUM-TASTIC.

$0.99 for a mustard relish dog.  Yup.  Sweet mustard relish and a juicy hot dog.

Need I say more?  It&apos;s fast, cheap, and DELICIOUS.  I am going to gain a million pounds now that this place is open in Richmond.

Ok, I gave this place another shot. Got a hamburger &quot;all the way&quot;, fries, and a coke. It was decent. Still not as good as Five Guys, but a perfectly decent burger.

The biggest difference between this trip and my earlier trip is that they actually got my order right this time. I still maintain that the audio system they&apos;re using at the drive through is pretty poor. The people in the restaurant seem to have a lot of trouble hearing the customers. But when all was said and done, the burger was just fine.

No walk up line? This is stubbornness staring impracticality right in the eye with authority. No one should have to wait 20min for fast food, nonetheless on a public road. The only posted menu is at the ordering station, so a first-timer such as myself has to interpret the menu at the ordering station, creating an even bigger holdup. After ordering, we are expected to eat in our car, unless the picnic table-less parking lot next door that seemingly belongs to the church becomes our designated eating area.

Logistically these people are in the stone age...as well as the local agency that allows them to operate.

The food itself was pretty good. For under five bucks I had a flavorful cajun chicken sandwich, and two sides! (small, but still two). The menu is expansive and although the milkshake was highly recommended, I couldn&apos;t find the room in my stomach. Maybe I would go back during off hours.

Today was my second time visiting Cook-Out...  The first time was Yay, I&apos;m a Fan, but today has solidified the Woohoo! As good as it gets! Why did I offer the additional star you ask?  Well, I ordered the same meal, but this time with a shake, the most mouth watering Styrofoam cup of goodness anyone could ever have, which switched my mind to a 5!!!!

The Strawberry Cheesecake Milkshake had little bits of yummy cheesecake and strawberries swimming all around my cup and stopping up my straw!!!!

Excellence I must say...

This place is well worth the 20 minute wait in line.  Many people get upset about the long lines, but the whole experience is what makes this place special.  Cars a lined up down the street just to get a taste of the best burgers and shakes a man or woman has ever tasted.  Not to mention the price is just as delectable as the food!!!  UNDER 5 BUCKS, for a combination of a sandwich and two sides...  Trust me, it doesn&apos;t get any better than this...  If you don&apos;t mind waiting 20 frustrating, yet irresistible minutes for one of the best burgers you will ever eat, then Cook-Out is for you!!!

After hearing how some customers had to wait 30+ minutes in a drive thru, I attended this restaurant around 11:00am on a Sunday. The menu is extensive, particularly the milkshake section. The one special that caught my attention was the two items, a side and a milkshake for $5.50. Even though I was the first in line that day, I noticed why customers have to wait so long for their food. All the food there is fried/prepared on the spot, vs. a place like McDonalds where food is already prepared for faster drive through service. In my opinion, the food was not as good as people said it would be. I had a BBW sandwich, chicken nuggets, and french fries. The milkshake was pretty good, or shall i say diabetes in a cup. I would recommend going to this place as soon as it opens to avoid waiting for long periods of time, but this would not be a regular place to visit for me.

Almost went with 4 stars due to the line and other cars being so close to me made me a bbit on edge, but that&apos;s not there fault the food is good.
I had the huge cheddar style burger it was not too greasy and pretty basic onion rings, fries, corndog and a banana pudding  milkshake.
Everything was good but the milkshake was the best believe I have ever had.
It lived up to its hype and was better and way cheaper then five guys.

Cook-out is awesome, but you have to order right.  If you pick shit off the menu individually, it&apos;s expensive.  If you get a tray and upgrade to a milkshake, you get an awesome deal - burger, fries, corn dog, and a really good milkshake for $5.50.  Note that you get a better deal if you get a side that can&apos;t be split in half.  If you get hushpuppies, you get half of a 99 cent order of hushpuppies.  However, since they can&apos;t split a corn dog in half, you get an entire 99 cent corn dog with the tray.  Their burgers are somewhere between Wendy&apos;s and Five Guys, and the barbecue will do in a pinch.

We went back for a second time to make sure that we got a truly honest assessment, and we found that the food was worse on this occasion than on our initial visit.  I did try the BBQ, however, and while it was tasty, it didn&apos;t taste like true NC style barbecue. The reason?  The sauce lacked a kick and was easily overpowered by the over abundant coleslaw.  I have to change my opinion.  This place kinda...sucks.

The food for the price is well worth it- I&apos;ve been twice in 24 hours!!! If you want high end food at low prices this isn&apos;t for you-

- go there
- order what you want
- save a ton of money
-get your food and eat it

All these bad reviews are by snobby wanna be food critics

A bunch of geniuses over at Cookout on W Broad.

I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, nuggets and a bacon wrap with a snickers shake.

I received a regular chicken sandwich, fries and a bacon wrap with 3/4 of a cup of softserve ice cream on top of a barely broken up snickers bar.

The bacon wrap was alright, except for the cheese being stuffed into the very bottom, which makes no sense. I already drove away before checking the contents of my meal,  which is on me. But, the person taking my order had to be corrected when she was reading it back to me. Does that mean she heard my order twice before entering in everything wrong? Yes

I can&apos;t quite understand why reviewers must always compare fast food joints to other fast food joints. Why is it being compared to In-N-Out? It&apos;s not trying to be In-N-Out or compete with In-N-Out for krikey sake we don&apos;t even have an In-N-Out in Richmond. And while I&apos;m at it, come on people it&apos;s fast food, it&apos;s not gourmet or even a sit down restaurant. For fast food it&apos;s damn good. where else are you going to get a BBQ platter with fries, hush puppies, pulled pork&amp;cole slaw for under $5. The char grilled burgers are excellent, 99 cents for a dozen hush puppies, French fries are good too, the prices are great and the food is good. Don&apos;t you even let me hear you compare the burger to Five Guys - It&apos;s not Five Guys! The shakes are great, I&apos;ve tried the Watermelon, blueberry cheesecake and the Cappucino. It&apos;s good simple, cheap, fast food, take it for what it is or go somewhere else, we don&apos;t need you holding up the line.

Visiting Richmond over the weekend there was alot of traffic going to this place called the cookout. Me and my bf btw us ordered 5 nuggets, fries bacon cheeseburger, ft long hot dog hush puppies and two large drinks for all under $10 I repeat under $10 you cant beat that. The only negative thing is the line is super long and there is no place too sit. Buuttt its worth the wait!!

When I was growing up in a rural town out west, we had a nearby place we called &quot;the hamburger stand&quot;. I don&apos;t even remember its name but it was owned by a local family.  It had a big menu with lots of choices but it was fundamentally a burger stand. As I think back, I liked it because the burgers had all the great standard toppings (lettuce, tomato, raw onions, mayo, mustard, ketchup), flavors, and textures  that make a classic &quot;American&quot; burger and I could get a big meal with my weekly $5 allowance.  Cook-Out is this place all over again and I&apos;m happy I found it! The chain competition in this classic burger challenge includes 5-Guys... very good burgers; In-N-Out Burgers...also very good, but in California; Sonic...good but inconsistent for me.  I know there are also gourmet burgers around that are delicious and they have their place in my dining experiences, but sometimes you just want a hamburger stand cheeseburger, onion rings, and a peanut butter milkshake.  I can&apos;t speak to the 30-minute drive-thru waits here because I had zero wait time at 5pm. I&apos;m anxious to go back and try more of the menu but I know they&apos;ll have my classic burger whenever I want it.

Seriously, it&apos;s okay, but nothing to write home about.  It&apos;s typical fast food, and I&apos;m a bit puzzled as to why there is all this hype.  It&apos;s a good value for what you get, I guess.  The selection of milkshake flavors is amazing.  But for the money, go to Five Guys and avoid the unnecessary lines.  I predict that within six months, Cook-Out will be an ordinary fast food drive thru with no lines.  I think people are just enamored with the idea of a new fast food place to choose from.  And there&apos;s nothing wrong with that.

we waited in line here for a half hour.  cars were in line all the way down the block.  They do move you through quickly though.  We had never been to a cookout before, so we weren&apos;t sure what we were in for here.  I wish they would have handed us a menu to look at while we were in line in our car.  We would have been able to order quicker if we had.  Since the wait was so long, I decided to order just about everything I thought i might like to try, cuz... who knew when i might want to sit in this line again!  We spent about 20 bucks and got a rediculous ammount of food for that.  I was way beyond full. The shakes here are awesome, and so reasonably priced.  if you come here, get a shake.  the hush puppies are delicious and for 99 cents, you get like 10 or 12 of them, which is a great deal.  the bbq sandwich is a little spicy, but other than that, it&apos;s perfect.  the hot dogs are good enough, and i&apos;m kind of a hot dog snob, if one can make a claim like that.  the burgers reminded me a little of in and out burger.  I say a little, because they are in no way as good as in and out, but it did make me think of in and out.  this place is a little out of the way for us.  the line is a hassle too.  all in all, good food and good prices, but i&apos;m not sure how often we&apos;ll be back.

I live not to far from cook out so I pass by a lot. I&apos;ve been wondering what the traffic was all about until last night. I had my husband go get us some burgers&amp;shakes. The burger was awesome, defiantly not like anything you would get at any other fast food place&amp;for the price we thought it was great! The fries were good&amp;everything was pipping hot. There was a long line it took about 15 mins, they forgot my onion rings&amp;although we loved the thickness of the shakes we thought they could have been more flavorful. I had the chocolate Hershey&amp;my husband had the Oreo. I would defiantly go back&amp;I think I will give the shakes another try, would love to try the cheesecake flavor.
