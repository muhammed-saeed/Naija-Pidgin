		Foodservice Employee Interview 
 
 Questions List 

 
 
 Experienced food service managers and recruiters worked on this list of 
 interview questions. 
 Most managers hire for skills, but fire for character. Because of the overwhelming problems associated with hiring employees 
 who lack required character traits, more and more food service managers are asking 
 character-discerning questions when interviewing employees. Legal penalties for negligent hiring are 
 also propelling character-based hiring policies. 

 

 This list is quite large and growing. Browse the list or perform a word search (Ctrl+F) 
 on a job title or on a trait you want questions for and see what shows 
 up. Many hours were spent editing this list of job interview questions 
 and it is unfinished. Some interview questions are very clever, some are 
 ok and a few are inappropriate. Use with caution and wisdom. 
 Nevertheless, this list of employee interview questions is very useful.

 A word of caution to employers 

 In my leadership 
 workshops about hiring employees of character, I learned some managers ask: 

 You worked seven days 
 straight. Someone calls in sick and the manager asks you to work. You 
 have a prior commitment with your family. How do you handle this? 

   

 Personally I would say, 
 I&apos;m a person of integrity. I try to be flexible and helpful for my employer 
 but keeping commitments with the most important people 
 in my life also is important. Then I would turn the question onto the interviewer and 
 require a similar response before I accept the position. So be careful about placing inappropriate 
 burdens on job applicants and employees ... especially less educated 
 low-wage employees! Remember God is recording everything and is an 
 advocate for poor people. 

Proverbs 22:16 He who oppresses the poor to make more for himself..., 
 will only come to poverty.

 

 More Hiring 
 Tips 

Don&apos;t hire on the spot.
 Let applicants 
 think about your questions and their answers on the way home.
Tell applicants to call you one or two days later.
Only 
 hire people who are interested enough in the job to take the second step 
 of calling back. This 
 helps weed out people who lied and arent real interested in the 
 job.
