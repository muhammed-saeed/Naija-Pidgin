 IHOP Restaurant Menu Prices For Kids 
 by under Family Restaurant Menu Prices 
 So as we sit here and try to decide where to eat, one thing is for sure, we want value and price, and good quality.  The IHOP restaurant menu prices exactly delivers just that.  If you travel with kids 12 and under, then they deliver a wallop!  Why?  Well, because kids 12 and under eat for free from the IHOP menu from the hours of 4:00–8:00 p.m., with an accompanying adult meal purchase.  Drinks are not included in this deal though, but still there is a substantial savings with this deal. One that has me heading for this universal breakfast, lunch, and dinner restaurant at least once a week. Without further delay save today on restaurant purchases right here! 

There are new IHOP locations opening up daily, and there has been two new ones opened in recent months in my neighborhood, the new locations are great and the food equally great.  They usually have movie themes as well, more recently making fun for my little kids with the“Despicable Me”movie pancakes and colored flavored drinks.  When ordering from the IHOP restaurant menu prices, you can expect to get plenty of affordable items.  Such items like pancakes, French Toast, Omelette’s like the Colorado Omelette, and the Steak Omelette, and even make your own egg omelettes.  Additional sides include; Bacon, Sausage, Hash Browns, and a variation of toast to include; Wheat, White, Rye, and a host of other bread flavors.

My kids enjoy the IHOP menu breakfast over any other of the competition.  Restaurants like Denny’s, Waffle House, McDonalds, Burger King, and Piccadilly.  I must say that I agree with their choice.  The IHOP restaurant menu prices are competitive and the food magnificent.  After all that is all I look for in any restaurant and this one delivers.  Be it morning, mid-afternoon, or evening and late night, this is the place to get what you want, when you want it.  Most of their locations are opened 24 hours a day, so anytime is right, if the time is right for you!  Your order, made just the way you want it. A place the whole family can enjoy… Get your free gift card today for a restaurant of your choice!
