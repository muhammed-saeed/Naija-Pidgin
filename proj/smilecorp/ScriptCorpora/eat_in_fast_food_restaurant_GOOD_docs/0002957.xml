 Ru San’s 
 Posted on February 7, 2012 by Joe Reply 
 I really struggled with this review. I don’t normally find chain restaurants interesting enough to write about and it was difficult to make an interesting story. Nonetheless, enjoy… 

I am not a fan of sushi. Even after eating at Ru San’s, I’m still not convinced. However, there is still plenty on the menu for fans of anything but sushi.

Ru San’s is a chain and quite a popular chain at that. With that comes a chain restaurant atmosphere; there’s very little unique or charming about Ru San’s. It’s busy, loud, and you’ll probably see someone you know. Kimberly and I were stuffed into a small table in the back; we had a wonderful view of the bathroom, not the sushi bar.
 
Potato, Zucchini, and Swordfish Tempura
 
That being said, I did have a marginally above average meal at Ru San’s. Because of my disdain for raw slabs of fish meat on a pile of rice, I effectively removed myself from enjoying 75% of the menu. What I did order was enjoyable American interpretation of Asian food.
 
Tuna and Red Snapper Sushi
 
Authenticity is rarely a focus of any chain restaurant, and Ru San’s is no different. I’m no expert in pan-Asian cuisine but I imagine even fishier tasting fish is involved. I ordered three different types of sushi; tuna, red snapper, and eel. In my not-so-humble opinion, they all tasted the same…exactly as I expect raw fish to taste. Kimberly loves Sushi, and I will copy and paste her notes below; for readers who are into that sort of thing.
 
Rainbow Roll–I always order a rainbow roll and this was my favorite of the night. Beware: they put lots of roe on there.

Spicy Salmon Maki–Good, under the $1 maki section…good price.

Erika #2 (California roll-ish sushi with seared beef on top)–seared beef was new but welcome flavor. Lots of sauce but creamy and delicious.

I did enjoy the tempura (potatoes, zucchini, and swordfish) but it wasn’t anything to write home about. The fried octopus, which is tough and chewy by nature, seemed bland and extra chewy.
 
Fried Octopus (Not Calamari)
 
I would like to address the service at Ru San’s. Notorious for poor service, we must have gotten lucky because our waiter, Philip W., was absolutely incredible and without hyperbole, the best waiter I’ve ever had.

On the whole, Ru San’s is a decent Sushi joint. I’ve heard that there are nicer and more pleasant alternatives, but at this point in time I’ve had enough sushi to last me a long time.

Grade: C+

Price: $44 not including tip (we ordered a TON of food, but the price can rise very quickly)

 Quick Bite: ADD Drug 
 Posted on January 30, 2012 by Joe Reply 
Located inside an innocuous drug store named ADD Drug sits a fantastic little diner counter. With a total of 20 hard, plastic bar stools, space is limited; be prepared to wait. While the restaurant is small in size, it certainly makes up for in charm. I’ve never eaten in a place that truly feels like it’s lost in time. There’s something so honest about eating at a burger joint like this that it makes me want to put on my best $40 suit and fedora, order a malted milkshake (which is phenomenal by the way), and take my girlfriend to the sock hop.
 
Best Milkshake in Athens
 
The food is greasy, there’s no escaping that. However, everything on the menu is delicious. Both breakfast and lunch food is served all day (9-5 on weekdays and 9-3:30 on Saturday). The food is similar to the Varsity, but underneath the same amount of grease, oil, and fat, tastes fresher and more flavorful. Big flavor doesn’t mean big prices however and a bacon cheeseburger costs no more than $3.50. If you’re strapped for cash, then ADD Drug is as good of a deal as any fast food restaurant. If there’s one piece of advice you take from this review, GET A MALT. They are, without question, the BEST milkshakes in town.
 
Simple, Yet Delicious

 Local Plug: Athens Farmers Market 
 Posted on November 27, 2011 by Joe Reply 
No words; just pictures from start to finish. And a warning: you pay in pogs, which are purchased at the entrance. It feels like monopoly money and we racked up a $50 tab quickly.

There&apos;s a fancy name for this brewing technique but I can&apos;t remember

 Big City Bread 
 Posted on November 27, 2011 by Joe Reply 
Like a father in his son, I am disappointed. After hearing (and seeing on urbanspoon) the rave reviews of one of the most popular, if not the most popular, brunch joint in Athens. I had to try it out for myself. This review is a month in the making, because Big City Bread was the first restaurant I’ve eaten at in Athens that I’ve actively disliked. I visited twice, just to make sure my initial impression was right.
 
Just average sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit
 
It was. To sum up the glaring problem with Big City Bread, it’s simply too popular for its own good. Not in a hipster,“Arcade-Fire-won-album-of-the-year-now-I-can’t-like-them”kind of way. I mean in a disorganized, understaffed kind of way. I am patient and forgiving, but the wait, not just in the slow-moving line, but also once you’ve found a scarce outside table, is flat-out unacceptable. Don’t even waste your time trying to find an inside table. At atmosphere like this creates stress, and who wants that when they’re trying to enjoy a Sunday brunch?
 
Just the tip of the iceberg
 
“Why don’t you try going during less busy hours, you idiot!”You might say. I’ve eaten at around opening and near closing, and the only two registers don’t cut it regardless of time. Good food takes time, I understand this, however over an hour wait (not exaggerating) for french toast and a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit is just ridiculous.
 
Even more crowded on the inside.
 
This wait would almost be forgivable if the food was incredible. Sadly it’s merely good. I’m sure it seems ridiculous that I’m complaining about good food, but with the incredible range of excellent eats in Athens, good just isn’t that special. If you were to do a blindfold test comparing Big City Bread to IHOP, you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference. I’d honestly rather go to IHOP, you’ll get more for your money. The one bright spot was the roasted potatoes, which on my first visit seemed like the best I’d ever had. However, on the second visit, they weren’t that great. I really, really hope my first sampling of potatoes is more indicative than my second.
 
French Toast
 
I truly hate being disappointed with a restaurant. It’s my money being spent on okay food, just as it will be your money. I would never tell anyone to stay away from Big City Bread, however, it certainly didn’t meet the hype.

Grade: C

Cost: $12 for sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit, roasted potatoes, and coffee. WARNING: a side of bacon is $2.50 and comes with only 2 pieces. A total rip off.

 Clocked! 
 Posted on November 2, 2011 by Joe 1 
Clocked! (a restaurant with an exclamation mark in its name and a restaurant whose exclamation mark I will no longer use) is a diner-style burger joint located near the 40 Watt and coincidentally in the same building as Farm 255.
 
Bar Area and My Big Meatball Head
 
As soon as you step in, you are greeted by an array of colors, lights, and movie posters (the poster above our table was in Italian, making for some fun translation while waiting for our food).  Our waitress was also very friendly and helpful, however she seemed a little more enthusiastic than the rest of the crew.
 
Best Milkshake Ever?
 
Let’s dive right into the food. We (I) ordered a chocolate malt to begin with but selflessly shared it with my girlfriend as great boyfriends tend to do. That being said, it was very difficult to share because it was really good. Kimberly said that it was the best milkshake she’d ever had.
 
Double-Fried Fries
 
For our main course, she got the mushroom and swiss grilled cheese and sweet potato fries with feta dipping sauce. I’m told the feta sauce is even better than The Grill’s. As for myself, I ordered the“Ring of Fire”burger. Everything is made-to-order, so your order comes out piecemeal (see what I did there?) which can be strange and even off-putting to first timers. Fries come to your table about ten minutes before your burger, in an attempt to give you the freshest fries possible. They are double fried, very hot, and come in heaps. Simply great.
 
Sweet Potato Fries and Feta Sauce
 
The burger, covered in jalapenos, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and spicy mayo, was good. No specific part stood out on its own, however the overall flavor was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.“Ring of Fire”was also an apt description of my mouth. Beware, the burger was VERY spicy.
 
Spicy but Sooo Good
 
Clocked is fun and delicious, albeit a little pricy. Our shake was $4.25 and a burger and fries can set you back about $12-14 before tip. That being said, Clocked makes a great Friday night treat and for anyone that loves a good burger, shouldn’t be missed.

 Royal Peasant Revisited 
 Posted on October 27, 2011 by Joe Reply 
The Royal Peasant is the only restaurant I’ve“reviewed”that has received less than a A rating. I’m heavily in favor of second chances, so I decided to give it another shot. Kimberly, Tony (my roommate), and myself returned on a Wednesday afternoon to watch some Champions League soccer.

The vibe given off during weekdays is very different. Less than ten people easily fit inside the bar area, huddling around the televisions. We didn’t get meals, however we did get one of the daily specials, in this case it was poutine.
 
If only I had a jean jacket. Then I would be a true Canadian.
 
For the uninitiated, poutine is a Canadian dish comprised essentially of french fries, cheese and gravy. The Peasant went a step further and added fried pork belly (VERY much like bacon), provolone cheese, and red and yellow bell pepper strips. None of us had ever eaten poutine before, and all came away pleasantly surprised. When running through the list of ingredients, it seems more efficient to just mainline grease. In a pleasant twist, it never seemed over-encumbered by its greasy parts and proved a nice variation on the standard cheese fries.

Kimberly and I also ordered vanilla pound cake with lemon custard, homemade whipping cream, and rum sauce. It was light, simple and perfectly portioned. The custard had only a hint of lemon, which was just enough.
 
Pound Cake for Two
 
I’m glad I gave the Royal Peasant a second chance. It was a joy to just drink a pint and watch the game with friends.

 Here’s a link to the original article.
