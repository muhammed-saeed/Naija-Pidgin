Before you begin using the &quot;script&quot; that is to follow, please read these comments, because this is really more than a script or hypnosis patter, when you really begin to understand how you can use it.

Since 5-PATH®is a universal approach to doing hypnotherapy, it seemed that it would be extremely useful if a universal approach to Phase I, the Direct Suggestion Phase, could be developed. This script is virtually universal because it is extremely flexible. In actuality, there could be no such thing as a completely universal script that would work in every case, but I believe this approach comes pretty close. It uses the idea of coming to a &quot;fork in the road,&quot; to represent a life-changing choice. This idea idiom is found in almost every culture in one form or another. It also uses the familiar idea of a &quot;High Road&quot; and a &quot;Low Road&quot; of which the &quot;High Road&quot; is universally accepted as being the preferable choice, which may require some effort, but well worth it.

This approach to a Direct Suggestion (Phase I) session will be particularly effective for those who want to change behavior (as opposed to mood or phobia problems, but can be used in this case also). The behaviors could include smoking, over-eating, drug or alcohol abuse, even things like shyness, or any other self-defeating behavior.

Also, this script can be followed by additional patter, or a more precise patter containing suggestions for the specific change that your client wants to make, if you deem it necessary or useful. In that case, this script can be considered as a way to prepare the client for maximum suggestibility for the coming suggestions.

When using this script, I recommend that the experienced therapist, use it mostly in principle, and freely vary from it. Freely adapt it to your client&apos;s needs and personality (and your style of delivery), changing wording as you see fit, to accomplish the goal. The goal here is to make the client highly suggestible for suggestions associated to the change they want to make. This is vividly accomplished by way of comparing, what they have been doing along with its outcome (i.e., the difficulties that smoking causes), and the likely outcome of making the change (i.e. better health as a nonsmoker).

In the script, doing the easy thing (taking the Low Road), is associated with ultimate failure, while putting some effort into making the change is associated with ultimate success and achievement (taking the High Road).

When you take your client down the Low Road, remember to have her become aware of the people and objects associated with that low and painful road. For example, if working with a smoker, as you go down the bad road of smoking, have her look at all of the cigarette butts and ashtrays along the way, so that the emotional pain of the Low Road experience becomes associated with those items. If you are working with a substance abuser, have her look at all of the paraphernalia and drug-using friends that are all along that road. This is useful because it helps your client to break free from associating pleasure with these items and individuals. Then they can begin to associate pleasure and success with the people and things on the road on the right as you point them out.

The High Road To Success 

Today you are standing at a fork in the road of your life. You have come to a decision point. Should you continue to do what you have been doing with regard to____________________?

You think about all the problems and concerns that __________ brings into your life.

(Mention some of the reasons your client told you she wants to make the change).

The road on the left is a slow downward road. It is easy to take the Low Road. You could just coast down it. It is the path of doing what you have been doing for so long. But, it is a path of misery. The road on the right goes upward. It will take some effort to take the High Road. But, it is the way of freedom, health and life. It is the road of being in control of your life. It is the High Road To Success!

Look at the road on the left. It means carrying all of the problems associated with continuing to ________with you even longer than you already have. Think of how bad ________makes you feel. Really allow yourself to feel the weight of the burden of this self-destructive behavior. Feel your desire to be free from all of the ill effects of hurting yourself this way.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3, and we are going to go down that low road of being out of control one more year. 1, 2, 3! There you are, after one more year of being out of control--of being miserable because you have continued to______________________________. You feel the weight of the disappointment in yourself. You notice the things that litter this painful way of living (mention paraphernalia, such as ashtrays, bottles, etc.) (If it seems appropriate to the issue, point out the people associated with the problem, the bad influences.) There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have another year of __________? Do I feel better having made this decision? Do I feel healthier or worse? Do I look and feel better about myself, or not? Do I feel smarter? Feel the disappointment you have in yourself for continuing to __________________for another year!&quot;

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3 and we are going to go down to the 5 year point on this road of being free of ___________ to the year ______! 1, 2, 3! There you are after 5 more years of being on the low road. Bring fourth all of the effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision. You feel ___________. You feel hopeless. Now look around you and you see all of the (mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can&apos;t stand them any more. Maybe you even hate the sight of them. If there are people associated with doing this _____________, are they really your friends? Do they really care about you? Again, you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for ___________ for 5 more years? Do I have the right to do this to myself? Am I healthier for making this choice? How is it affecting my life? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel smarter for _________________ for an additional 5 years?&quot;

And now I count from 1 to 3 and we move down to the 10-year point on this low road of continuing to the year_________. 1, 2, 3! There you are after 10 more years of hurting yourself by _____________. Once again, bring fourth all of the cumulative effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision, of continuing to _______for 10 more years. You feel _____________. You feel more hopeless. Again, you look around you and you see all of the (mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can&apos;t stand them any more. Maybe you even hate the sight of them. If there are people associated with doing this _____________, are they really your friends? Do they really care about you? How do you feel about them? There is a mirror there and you look at yourself. You ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for ___________ for 10 more years? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel intelligent for ________ for an additional 10 years?&quot; Really feel the consequences of remaining on this low but easy road.

As I count back from 5 to 1 you come all the way back to the beginning of the fork in the road. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And, you feel better because none of that has to happen yet and it doesn&apos;t have to... You have decided not to let that happen to you. You have decided to take the High Road of Success on the right! You know that it will take a little more effort, but now you know in your heart and mind that it is worth it. You have decided to start taking better care of yourself! In fact you have already left the old way by coming here today! You are already taking your first steps toward freedom and success on the road on the right.

Let&apos;s see how this new decision to ____________ for life affects you. You think about all the good positive changes that becoming free from the self-destructive habit has brought into your life! Being free from all those problems--the feeling of really being in control and confidant. You are now on the path on the right, it means success and a feeling of energy and optimism.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3, and we are going to go down that road of having made this change for one year. 1, 2, 3! There you are after one year of being in control. You feel good, great! You have done it you are a success and you never felt better and you are going to feel even better yet! There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have accomplished my goal for a whole year? (If it seems appropriate to the problem, point out the things/items and people associated with this new way of living and being.) Do I feel better having made this healthy decision? Do I feel smarter?&quot; Feel the pride and health that is inside of you. Was it worth it? Do you want to continue to stay on the High Road of Success?

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3 and we are going to go down to the 5 year point on this road of being successful in making this change to the year_______! 1,2,3! There you are after 5 more years of success, of reaping the rewards of making this permanent change in how you ____________. 5 years of being in control and energized! Bring forth right now all of the effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision. You feel strong. Everything in your life is better for having made this permanent change. Enjoy the feeling of knowing that you have made a permanent change, knowing that you will never go back to the old way.

And now I count from 1 to 3 and we move down to the 10-year point on this High Road of Success to the year _______. 1, 2, 3, and there you are after 10 more years of making this good and positive change in your life. Bring forth all of the effects of that smart choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision, of continuing to be in control for 10 more years.

_________________ is now simply something that you used to do. It was a mistake to have ever done it, but now you are free and will remain free for the rest of your life! You look into that mirror one more time and ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for __________________ for 10 more years? Would I ever go back to that old bad habit of hurting myself by ________________? Am I glad that I have made this permanent change? A change made for good?&quot; Of course you are!

I count back to 1 and you are back in the year __________________, 5,4,3,2,1. You now have a new found level of certainty that you are ready--really ready to make this change! You are now ready to accept powerful hypnotic suggestions to help to keep you on the road on the right, the High Road of Success.

Now your subconscious mind fully accepts the suggestion that you will never ________________ again. (Or, &quot;From now on you will ___________________________.&quot;) This keeps you on the High Road of Success on the right. (Repeat and add benefits that your client expects to receive from making this change. For example, &quot;Now that you have decided to become a non-smoker for good, you will find_____.&quot;)

This script can then be followed up with a short patter script or direct drive technique, etc. It really prepares clients for further suggestions or procedures such as Forgiveness Therapy or Parts Mediation Therapy, that help your clients make the changes that they want to make. We often use this script for smoking and then follow it up with another smoking cessation script.

Here is an example of how the approach can be used when working with smoking cessation. Alterations and adaptations will be in bold.

The High Road To Success: As A Nonsmoker

Today you are standing at a fork in the road of your life. You have come to a decision point. Should you continue to do what you have been doing with regard to smoking?

You think about all the problems and concerns that smoking brings into your life.

(Mention some of the reasons your client told you she wants to make the change).

You think about how it has robbed you of money, energy, health, and having a sense of control over your life.

The road on the left is a slow downward road. It is easy to take the Low Road. You could just coast down it. It is the path of doing what you have been doing for so long, by continuing to smoke. But, it is a path of misery. The road on the right goes upward. It will take some effort to take the High Road. But, it is the way of freedom, health and life. It is the road of being in control of your life. It is the High Road To Success! It is the road you have decided to take as a nonsmoker.

Look at the road on the left. It means carrying all of the problems associated with continuing to smoke with you even longer than you already have. Think of how bad smoking makes you feel. Really allow yourself to feel the weight of the burden of this self-destructive behavior. Feel your desire to be free from all of the ill effects of hurting yourself by smoking and taking poison into your body.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3, and we are going to go down that low road of being out of control one more year. 1, 2, 3! There you are, after one more year of being out of control--of being miserable because you have continued to smoke cigarettes. You feel the weight of the disappointment in yourself. You notice the things that litter this painful way of living-filthy ashtrays, burns in fabrics and furniture, and the smell! You see a road littered with cigarette butts, and cartons or packs of cigarettes. You see them and they make you feel this way. (mention the associated paraphernalia, such as ashtrays, bottles, etc.) You see others that you know, who smoke, maybe it is the ones that you have smoked with, or others that you have seen huddled together outside of buildings or stuck in the smoking section of restaurants, and the sight of them makes you feel sorry for them, they are stuck on the Low Road of being a smoker. (If it seems appropriate to the issue, point out the people associated with the problem, the bad influences.) There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have another year of smoking cigarettes? Do I feel better having made this decision? Do I feel healthier or worse? Do I look and feel better about myself, or not? Do I feel smarter?&quot; Feel the disappointment you have in yourself for continuing to smoke for another year!

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3 and we are going to go down to the 5 year point on this road of a smoker to the year ______! 1, 2, 3! There you are after 5 more years of being on the Low Road. Bring forth all of the effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision. You feel unhealthy, worried about the effects of putting tobacco poison in your mouth everyday. You feel hopeless. Now look around you and you see all of those cartons and packs of cigarettes that you have bought, the dirty stinking ashtrays, the buts, the smell on your clothes and hands and face, and you hate it because it brings in all of these terrible feelings of feeling out of control, a victim of tobacco marketing. (Mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can?t stand them any more. Maybe you even hate the sight of them. You see others on the path, and they look terrible and they feel terrible. They are outsiders. Society is pushing them out, because they seem so ignorant or stubborn and they smell. No one wants them around their children, or to be around them socially or even at work because they smell. You may have smoked with some of these people. Are they really your friends? Do they really care about you? Again, you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for smoking for 5 more years? Do I have the right to do this to myself? Am I healthier for smoking? How is it affecting my life? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel smarter for smoking for an additional 5 years?&quot;

And now I count from 1 to 3 and we move down to the 10-year point on this low road of continuing to the year_________. 1, 2, 3! There you are after 10 more years of hurting yourself by smoking. Once again, bring forth all of the cumulative effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision, of continuing to smoke for 10 more years. You feel tired and worried about your health. You feel more hopeless. Again, you look around you and you see all of the things that are associated with making you feel this way, the ashtrays, the cigarette butts, the pack and cartons of tobacco poison in the form of cigarettes (mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can?t stand them any more. Maybe, you even hate the sight of them. Just looking at all that stuff associated with smoking makes you feel this way. You see the others who are on the road of being out of control with smoking. Maybe you wish you could help them. Some may be family or friends. Notice, how seeing them smoke makes you feel about cigarettes. There is a mirror there and you look at yourself. You ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for smoking for 10 more years? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel intelligent for being a smoker for an additional 10 years?&quot; Really feel the consequences of remaining on this low but easy road.

As I count back from 5 to 1, you come all the way back to the beginning of the fork in the road. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

You have decided to take the High Road of Success on the right! You know that it will take a little more effort, but now you know in your heart and mind that it is worth it.

You have more energy. You feel more in control. You feel more self-confident, even smarter. You are free of all of the worries, costs and inconveniences that cigarettes cause.

There you are after one year of being in control, of being a nonsmoker. You feel good, great! You have done it! You are a success and you never felt better and you are going to feel even better yet! There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have accomplished my goal of being a nonsmoker for a whole year?&quot; There are some new things in your life because you are more active and energetic. You are spending more and more time with friends that are on this High Road of success. You have inspired others to make this good healthy choice. (If it seems appropriate to the problem, point out the things/items and people associated with this new way of living and being.) &quot;Do I feel better having made this healthy decision?

The High Road To Success: And Becoming Lean And Healthy 

Today you are standing at a fork in the road of your life. You have come to a decision point. Should you continue to do what you have been doing with regard to taking good care of your body?

You think about all the problems and concerns that being overweight brings into your life.

(Mention some of the reasons your client told you she wants to make the change).

You think about how being overweight has robbed you of energy, health, success and feeling confident about your appearance.

The road on the left is a slow downward road. It is easy to take the Low Road. You could just coast down it. It is the path of doing what you have been doing for so long, by continuing to be out of control to eating for the wrong reasons. But, it is a path of misery. The road on the right goes upward. It will take some effort to take the High Road. But, it is the way of freedom, health and life. It is the road of being in control of your life. It is the High Road To Success! It is the road you have decided to take by eating only when it is healthy to do so, and to eat in only a healthy way.

Look at the road on the left. It means carrying all of the problems associated with continuing to be overweight with you even longer than you already have. Think of how bad overeating and snacking can make you feel. Really allow yourself to feel the weight of the burden of this self-destructive behavior. Feel your desire to be free from all of the ill effects of hurting yourself by eating this way and not exercising your body sufficiently.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3, and we are going to go down that low road of being out of control one more year. 1, 2, 3! There you are, after one more year of being out of control--of being miserable because you have continued to be overweight. You feel the weight of the disappointment in yourself. You notice the things that litter this painful way of living-the snack food and candy wrappers--the second helpings or the portions that were too large, which made you too large. You see those kinds of things and they make you feel this way. (mention paraphernalia, such as ice-cream, chocolates, candy, etc.) You see others that you know, who are out of control to bad eating behaviors, maybe it is the ones that you have eaten or snacked with, and the sight of them makes you feel sorry for them, they are stuck on the Low Road of being a overweight. Some of them may have even tempted you to lose control. (If it seems appropriate to the issue, point out the people associated with the problem, the bad influences.) There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have another year of being out of control to food? Do I feel better having made this decision? Do I feel healthier or worse? Do I look and feel better about myself, or not? Do I feel smarter?&quot; Feel the disappointment you have in yourself for continuing to live this way for another year!

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3 and we are going to go down to the 5 year point on this road of being overweight to the year ______! 1, 2, 3! There you are after 5 more years of being on the Low Road. Bring fourth all of the effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision. You feel unhealthy, worried about the effects of putting too much food in your mouth everyday. You feel hopeless. Now look around you and you see all of those snack food wrappers, and large portions of food. The road is lttered with wrappers and empty dishes, and emotional pain. You hate looking at them because it brings back all of these terrible feelings of feeling out of control and overweight, a victim of marketing and habits. (Mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can?t stand them any more. Maybe you even hate the sight of them. You see others on the path, and they look terrible and they feel terrible because they eat too much or the wrong kind of things, and they don?t get enough exercise. They are outsiders. Society is pushing them out, because they seem so ignorant or stubborn. Some people don?t even want to be around them socially or even at work. You may have cheated on a diet with some of these people. Are they really your friends? Do they really care about you? Again, you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for being overweight for 5 more years? Do I have the right to do this to myself? Am I healthier for eating too much and not getting enough exercise? How is it affecting my life? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel smarter for being overweight for an additional 5 years?&quot;

And now I count from 1 to 3 and we move down to the 10-year point on this low road of continuing to the year_________. 1, 2, 3! There you are after 10 more years of hurting yourself by overeating. Once again, bring fourth all of the cumulative effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision, of continuing to be overweight for 10 more years. You feel tired and worried about your health. You feel more hopeless. Are you heavier? Again, you look around you and you see all of the things that are associated with making you feel this way, the foods and behaviors such as just sitting there and eating while you watch television or work on the computer or read. (Mention items associated with the problem, i.e., ashtrays, or candy wrappers, etc). You see all the things that you eat that have caused this to happen to you, snacks, cakes, cookies and second helpings. Those are the things that have done this to you. So, you can&apos;t stand them any more. Maybe you even hate the sight of them. Just looking at all that stuff associated with being overweight makes you feel this way. You see the others who are on the road of being out of control to food. Maybe you wish you could help them. Some may be family or friends. Notice how seeing them eat too much, or the wrong things makes you feel about doing those kinds of things yourself. There is a mirror there and you look at yourself. You ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for being overweight for 10 more years? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel intelligent for being out of control this way for an additional 10 years?&quot; Really feel the consequences of remaining on this low but easy road.

As I count back from 5 to 1 you come all the way back to the beginning of the fork in the road. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And, you feel better because none of that has to happen yet and it doesn&apos;t have to... You have decided not to let that happen to you. You have decided to take the High Road of Success on the right! You know that it will take a little more effort, but now you know in your heart and mind that it is worth it. You have decided to start taking better care of yourself! In fact you have already left the old way by coming here today! You are already taking your first steps toward freedom and success on the road on the right as a person who takes good care of her body, eats right and exercises!

Lets see how this new decision to be lean and healthy for life affects you. You think about all the good positive changes that becoming free from the self-destructive habit eating too much or the wrong kinds of things has brought into your life! Being free from all those problems--the feeling of really being in control and confidant. You are now on the road on the right, it means success and a feeling of energy and optimism. You have more energy. You feel more in control. You feel more self-confident, even smarter. You are free of all of the worries, costs and inconveniences that being overweight can cause.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3, and we are going to go down that road of being lean and healthy. Of having made this healthy change for one year. 1, 2, 3! There you are after one year of being in control, of being slim and trim. You feel good, great! You have done it! You are a success and you never felt better and you are going to feel even better yet! There is a mirror there and you see yourself and you ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself? Am I happy to have accomplished my goal of being slim and trim for a whole year?&quot; There are some new things in your life because you are more active and energetic. You are spending more and more time with friends that are on this High Road of success. You have inspired others to make this good healthy choice. (If it seems appropriate to the problem, point out the things/items and people associated with this new way of living and being.) &quot;Do I feel better having made this healthy decision? Do I feel smarter?&quot; Feel the pride and health that is inside of you. Was it worth it? Do you want to continue to stay on the High Road of Success? You have decided that this life of being slim and trim, lean and healthy is the right life for you.

I&apos;m going to count from 1 to 3 and we are going to go down to the 5 year point on this road of being success in becoming and remaining lean and healthy to the year_______! 1,2,3! There you are after 5 more years of success, of reaping the rewards of making this permanent change in how you feel. You have found other ways to relax or take a break. Good healthy ways to take a break when you want to. 5 years of being in control and energized! Bring fourth right now all of the effects of that choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of that decision. You feel strong. This is how it feels as you maintain your lean healthy lifestyle. Everything in your life is better for having made this permanent change. Enjoy the feeling of knowing that you have made a permanent change, knowing that you will never go back to the old way.

And now I count from 1 to 3 and we move down to the 10-year point on this High Road of Success to the year _______. 1, 2, 3, and there you are after 10 more years of making this good and positive change in your life. Bring forth all of the effects of that smart choice! Really allow yourself to feel the effects of this decision, of continuing to be in control for 10 more years.

Overeating and eating too much is now simply something that you used to do. It was a mistake to have ever allowed yourself to become overweight, but now you are free from the fat and will remain free for the rest of your life! You look into that mirror one more time and ask yourself, &quot;Am I pleased with myself for making this good healthy change in my life for 10 more years? Would I ever go back to that old bad habit of hurting myself by making myself fat? Am I glad that I have made this permanent change?&quot; A change made for good! Of course you are!

I count back to 1 and you are back in the year __________________, 5,4,3,2,1. You now have a new found level of certainty that you are ready--really ready to make this change! You are now ready to accept powerful hypnotic suggestion to help to keep you on the road on the right, the High Road of Success, the road of always being in control of eating and exercise. Now your subconscious mind fully accepts the suggestion that you will never be overweight again. From now on you will always make being slim and healthy one of the most important things in your life. You will always check to see if you are hungry before you put anything to eat in your mouth. If you feel bad, you will respond to your feelings in a way that goes to the cause of the feelings. You will never again distract yourself or try to make yourself feel better by eating! If you need to make yourself feel better, you can do something else, any good and pleasant thing, so long as it isn&apos;t illegal, immoral or fattening. This will keep you free to be happier and healthier for the rest of your life! This keeps you on the High Road of Success on the right. (Repeat and add benefits that your client expects to receive from making this change. For example, &quot;You will always be able to maintain a slim and healthy body, because you will always remember that there is always something better to do than make yourself fat by eating too much or too frequently, or the wrong kinds of things. By doing this you have improved your life in every way!&quot;)

Again let me end this by saying that this is intended to be a very flexible approach. Use it as a basic structure, and adapt it to the needs of your clients. For example, if for some reason your client is unable to exercise, then don?t suggest that she exercise. If she can exercise and does not want to, you can&apos;t make her begin a program of exercise. In such a case, I would ask her how she feels about the idea of just becoming more active by parking farther away form the office or taking the stairs rather than the elevator. If she likes that approach, I suggest those kinds of behaviors.

It is time for 5-PATH®Therapists to move beyond the written script! I present to you this &quot;universal&quot; script as a way of accomplishing that goal.
