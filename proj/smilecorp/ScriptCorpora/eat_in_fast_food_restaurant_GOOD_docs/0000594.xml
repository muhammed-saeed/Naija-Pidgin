 Top 25 best drive-thrus for 2008 

October 9th, 2008, 6:45 am· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
 Each October, QSR Magazine ranks America’s Top 25 best fast-food drive throughs based on an in-depth look at speed of service, order accuracy, speaker clarity and appearance of menu boards.  (see rankings below)

This year, Chick-fil-A nabbed the top award, ranking as the overall winner for its combined score. Locally, Orange County-based Taco Bell , Del Taco and El Pollo Loco ranked among the best 15 with Del Taco ranking the highest at No. 5.

Some other noteworthy comments from the study:

- El Pollo Loco saw a huge drop in order accuracy, going from No. 4 in 2007 to No. 10.  Spokeswoman Julie Weeks suggested this as the reason for the drop.“We introduced a record number of new, limited time offerings in the past year, which may have contributed to this year’s order accuracy ranking.”

–Also, in the“accuracy”category, Del Taco moved up from No. 7 last year to No. 3 in 2008, while Taco Bell didn’t budge—remaining at No. 13.

- Looks like Taco Bell, which ranked No. 7 overall, could have made the Top 5 had it done better in these two areas: order accuracy and speaker clarity.

- Remind me never to hit Popeyes . It performed badly in nearly every category, thus its No. 25 overall ranking. Chick-fil-A, on the other hand, did the best in nearly every category but speed of service.

- Wendy’s is the speediest of the major fast-food chains tested. It nabbed the No. 1 spot in that category. I don’t want to take away from this ranking, but…..Wendy’s order accuracy came in at No. 12, which makes me think they’re whipping up food in a speedy manner, but not necessarily getting orders correct all the time.

Below is a chart listing the Top 25 chains, followed by their rankings in Speed of Service, Accuracy and Speaker Clarity. For rankings on Menu Board appearance, go here .

 Tell us: After reading the scores below, let me know if you think it reflects the kind of service you are getting at the drive-through. For example, I’m surprised by the No. 13 ranking of Del Taco on speed of service. I thought they’d do better than that.
