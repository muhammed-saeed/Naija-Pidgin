 ★★★★☆ Good chinese food at low price!

Jade Bowl has excellent food for a really great deal especially during their lunch hours, $4.75. They remind me of a fast food restaurant but with dine in quality food as they are very quick in preparing your meal but it does not take away from the quality. The amount of food is also good because I usually have enough to make two meals out of one order. Location is a little hard to see from the street even though they are right off of 75th and Antioch in a strip mall on the southwest corner.

 ★★★★★ AMAZING RESTAURANT, love it and go here all the time 
by maryelis at Citysearch 5 Jade Bowl Chinese Restaurant 
 August 07, 2010 
This is a great place, the people are very nice, one time the lady delivering my food tried to give back part of my tip because she said it was too much! They&apos;re awesome, the food is cheap and wonderful. I can hardly believe the review I read earlier about bad service...I&apos;ve been eating here for 2 years and never had a single mistake. Anyways, go and try it for yourself! Two thumbs!


 ★★★★☆ Great service, solid pricing 
by jpebcac at Citysearch 4 Jade Bowl Chinese Restaurant 
 June 04, 2010 
If you are looking for something to order into your office in the afternoon, very few restaurants beat the pricing of the lunch value for Jade bowl. A full Entre + Soup + Eggroll for an insane price. You can generally get 2 full meals, soup and a bunch of eggrolls and easily stay below $20.

That&apos;s a great value. It&apos;s not as easy to do this same for their evening delivery, as costs go up almost 40% after 5PM.. not sure what that is all about, but eh.

Delivery is one of the quickest for Chinese food in Johnson County, and compared to alternatives, the value can&apos;t be beat.

Pros: Lunch delivery service from Jade Bowl is amongst the best

Cons: Evening service can be a bit slow, value not as strong


 ★★★★★ THE VERY BEST IN KC! 
by Chinese at Citysearch 5 Jade Bowl Chinese Restaurant 
 May 06, 2010 
This is THE BEST Chinese Rest in all of KC. They are the preverbial hole in the wall establisment that doesn&apos;t need the frills to be the best. They are the best! I have been ordering food from them for at least 5 years (on a weekly basis) and there is no comparison, and I have been all over the world! They are amazing!
Amy E.

Pros: Kung Pau CHicken very very very very very hot!

Cons: THEY ARE THE BEST!

 ★☆☆☆☆ horrible service 
by a1m2s3 at Citysearch 1 Jade Bowl Chinese Restaurant 
 May 26, 2009 
I ordered from here last night, when the order was delivered I noticed that not one but two items were wrong. Instead of hot and sour soup I got egg drop and instead of pepper steak I got cashew chicken. When I called the place they were incredibly rude and kept telling me that I ordered what I got, refused to accept that they gave me the wrong order. The man on the phone was so rude I could not believe what I was hearing. I will NEVER order from here again and urge everyone else to do the same!!

Pros: Ill never have to be treated that horrible again.

Cons: horrible service


 ★★★★★ Awesome Chinese Food! 
by akboyd at Citysearch 5 Jade Bowl Chinese Restaurant 
 April 03, 2008 
They have great lo mein, chicken or shrimp, and everything is a huge portion. Their dinner deal, a meat, with rice and an eggroll is a great deal. I would definately recommend it! The owners are wonderful also. There is nowhere better around 75th&amp;I-35!

Pros: Great food, service. Very friendly, great location. Delivery is always fast.
