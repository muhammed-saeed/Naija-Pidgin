 Highly recommended for anyone who eats fast food.  A MUST HAVE!!!    
By: j.fisher - Sep 18, 2008
Version: 1.0
 As a &quot;road warrior&quot;, I&apos;m constantly trying to battle the bulge in a sea of fast food restaurants.  This application is a must for any one trying to stay fit on the road.  Not only does it help you make educated decisions on what you eat, but it&apos;s also quite surprising to find that some items I thought were healthy in fact are loaded with calories, and vice versa.
I&apos;ve used this application before on my blackberry, and have been wanting it again since I switched to the iphone.
It&apos;s simple, very informative (you can sort by calories, fiber, fat content, etc) and easy to use.  Highly recommended.

 
 
 Impressive list of restaurants    
By: Tom_C45 - Sep 18, 2008
Version: 1.0.17
 I was very impressed with the extensive list of restaurants: 41 fast food chains, close to 5,000 menu items. Even Starbucks is featured in the list. Using the application is very intuitive and there are different ways to search for an item. You tap on a restaurant icon and it automatically lists all the items on the menu. You can filter the list by simply typing the beginning of a word or even sort your results by category, calories, protein, etc. Love it! Totally worth the price, one of my best purchase on the iPhone.

 
 
 Wonderful App    
By: AppJunky - Apr 17, 2009
Version: 1.0.25
 This is a great app for checking calories. I only go to a few fast food restaurants since they are close to work, so the sorting ability is great to put the fast food places I go to right on the front page for quick access. It really helps a lot when &quot;trying&quot; to watch what I eat with summer coming up. It&apos;s actually quite fasinating to look through some of the huge calorie amounts some foods have... I used to stop and have breakfast at Burger King and found out their deluxe breakfast has something like 1100 calories... that&apos;s crazy....

 
 
 Very useful - could be great    
By: Comatoast - Nov 22, 2008
Version: 1.0.5
 I use this constantly! A few things I&apos;d like to see to make this great; • a straightforward scrolling list of places - the icon pages are nice, but one list would be quicker.• the ability to save meals at each venue - or a favorite meals area (or both). This would be incredibly helpful in figuring out what to eat without having to scroll though a full list if things you don&apos;t want to eat. Maybe a nutritional total for the meals you put together?Great start overall.

 
 
 Please    
By: SloppyMattt - Mar 26, 2009
Version: 1.0.20
 Love this application, but i would love to see more restaurants. A lot of what is available seems to be mostly for the people that live in the south and west. I live in the northeast, and have never been able to go to half of these establishments. Don&apos;t get me wrong, i love that it has a lot of places on it, but i seem to go to places that aren&apos;t listed, so i have no reference. Would love to see more restaurants added, such as: Red Robin, Eat N Park, Panera Bread, Sheetz, Olive Garden, Spaghetti Warehouse, King&apos;s, Vocelli Pizza, IHOP, and Craker Barrel. If you are going to include sit down style places like Bob Evans and Chili&apos;s, maybe tweak the name too and just called it a restaurant calorie counter.

 
 
 Eye-opening. Very good app    
By: Justamoment - Sep 19, 2009
Version: 1.0.35
 This is a very useful application, and an eye-opener for those of us who didn&apos;t know how far a fast food meal was taking us from our diets. From reading the reviews, It seems the developers have listed to their customers and continued adding stores and items to the lists. My only suggestion/request is, since there are SO MANY items listed now, many more than I would have any use for, make it so I can delete the 90 or percent of items of each menu, so I can quickly find the items I would be interested in. There are so many items, in so many flavors and colors (that I would never need), it makes it difficult to find my Big Mac or Arby&apos;s roast beef with Chedder sandwich. Thanks!

 
 
 Nice app design    
By: John the artist - Sep 18, 2008
Version: 1.0
 This app does what it does very well with a nice user interface. I&apos;ll use this a lot.

 
 
 Awesome!    
By: red_70 - Sep 18, 2008
Version: 1.0
 Very well done. Great features - easy access to Nutritional info which is instantly displayed under the item and you can also scroll through the menu items. Gives you the number of menu items on the bottom left hand corner. I was surprised and delighted of the many fast food places listed. More than worth its cost. Thank you!!!

 Cal counter very useful    
By: setzel - Nov 22, 2008
Version: 1.0.5
 This app is an awesome tool to have, would not want to be outwith it . Wish that it would add and track your choices to give an overall total of calories consumed per day.
The only question I have, will there be more fast food places added to the current list in the future.
This is a must have tool for anyone watching their calorie intake while on the road.

 Chomy14 - We submitted an update to add 3 restaurants (including Chili&apos;s) and the change to the description went live before the application itself did. Chili&apos;s, Bojangles, and PeiWei are now included in the latest version of the application.
To everyone asking about counting capability - we are looking into adding it.
