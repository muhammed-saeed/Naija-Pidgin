Celebites: Bill Clinton at Prime One Twelve

 Bill Clinton dined at Prime One Twelve last night. 
​ Former President Bill Clinton dined at Prime One Twelve last night with a party of eight people. The group sat in the wine room in the back of the trendy steakhouse. Although Prime One Twelve is known for its decadent fare (Kobe hotdogs, anyone?), Clinton stuck to more healthful sides like broccoli rabe, black beans and rice and sweet potato fries. Apparently, Clinton is on a restricted diet and is trying to lose weight before his daughter&apos;s wedding over the summer. Chelsea has asked her father to drop 15 pounds by the time of her nuptials. But the lack of gluttony didn&apos;t make Bill cranky. According to our source, the charismatic leader shook hands with the entire restaurant.

Short Order also hears that next door at Prime Italian, sexy model-actress Molly Sims was chowing down on more caloric dishes. Sims is in Miami to launch her new website, www.graycebymollysims.com , with a launch party tonight at LIV.
