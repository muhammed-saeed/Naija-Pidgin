 Heart Attack: Reducing Your Risk 
 July 10, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 Did you know? Heart attack is the leading cause of death in the United States. Learn how you can reduce your risk! 

 

Some of the risk factors for heart attack can be managed with lifestyle changes, and others–such as family history–cannot be changed. Here are some of the heart attack risk factors you can control through lifestyle changes:

 Smoking 
Those who smoke cigarettes are twice as likely to have a heart attack as non-smokers. Smoking other tobacco products and inhaling second-hand smoke, although not as great a risk as smoking cigarettes, can also increase your risk for heart attack.

 Lack of Physical Activity 
Regular exercise can help improve heart health and can help in reducing high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol.

 Excessive Alcohol Use 
Excessive alcohol consumption may cause increased blood pressure and other complications of the heart. However, studies suggest moderate drinking (one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men) may actually help in lowering the risk of heart disease.

 Obesity/Overweight 
Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of heart disease, even when no other risk factors are present. Being overweight or obese can increase your change of developing high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Even losing just 10-20 pounds can lower your risk.

 High Blood Pressure&amp;Cholesterol 
High blood pressure makes the heart work harder, which can cause it to get larger and weaker and increase your risk for heart attack. High LDL, or&quot;bad&quot;cholesterol, can lead to buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease and heart attack.

Talk to your doctor about your heart health and the lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your risk. For more information on reducing your risk of heart attack, visit our Health Library online. To learn more our services here at Central Florida Regional Hospital, visit us online or give us a call at 407-321-4500.

 Preparing Little Ones for Summer Camp 
 July 3, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 Summer camp provides the perfect opportunity for children to make new friends, learn new things and create memories to last a lifetime. Make sure your child has a safe and healthy camp experience! 

 

Before sending your little campers off for their big adventure, make sure you&apos;ve taken the right steps to prepare them. Here are some suggestions for making sure your little ones are ready for summer camp:

 Research the Camp 
Make sure the camp you send your little guy or gal to is accredited by the American Camp Association. You can also check out the camp to see how they score with the Better Business Bureau. Be sure to visit the camp before deciding. Find out if the camp is equipped to handle medical emergencies and learn about their procedures. Another great way to research a camp is to ask other parents for references.

 Address Special Needs &amp;Allergies 
If your child has any special needs such as allergies, medicine or an ongoing illness, work with your child&apos;s pediatrician and the camp to create a plan.

 Visit the Doctor 
Take your child for a pre-camp checkup to make sure he or she is in good health. While there, your doctor can also provide you with a review of your child&apos;s health that you can give to the camp.

 Prepare them Mentally 
If your child is going to camp for the first time, it can be a pretty big deal. Homesickness can be a concern, but it can be prevented with a little preparation. Make sure you discuss it with your child before the drop-off. You might want to take a trial run by arranging for your child to stay with relatives for a night or two to see how he or she does away from home.

Still a little nervous about sending your little camper off? Check out our Health Library or visit these resources to learn more about preparing for summer camp:

 Hurricane Season Prep: Creating a Disaster Supply Kit 
 June 26, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 Hurricane season began June 1–is your family prepared for a natural disaster? 

 

If you have to evacuate or remain in your home until further notice, would you have the necessary supplies to meet your family&apos;s needs? A disaster supply kit is easy to create and would be invaluable in the event of a natural disaster such as a hurricane. Here are some basics on creating a disaster supply kit.

A disaster supply kit should contain basic items that can help you and your family get by until help arrives for you. Keep your disaster supply kit packed in a portable container like a duffel bag or backpack, so you can take it with you easily in the event of an evacuation.

 Water 
You should store enough water to have one gallon of water per person, for each day that you may need it. About 3 days worth is usually sufficient. You can buy bottled water and keep it on hand in a safe location.

 Food 
Keep at least 3 days worth of nonperishable food items for each member of your household. This can be granola bars, protein bars, dry cereal, peanut butter and jelly, crackers, cookies, canned goods, dried fruit, instant coffee and more.

 First Aid 
Another essential component of your disaster supply kit are first aid materials. A basic first aid kit should be enough for minor injuries. For life-threatening emergencies, always call 9-1-1.

 Other Items to Include 

 Clean clothing and footwear Any medications you need Battery powered radio Flashlight Extra batteries Blankets/sleeping bags Copies of important documents such as drivers license, insurance cards, etc. Whistle Cash/credit card Supplies for your pet 

If you would like more information on creating a disaster supply kit and keeping your family safe this hurricane season, visit our Health Library today. For more information on our services at Central Florida Regional Hospital, visit us online or give us a call at 407-321-4500.

 Stay Safe this Fourth! 
 June 19, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 Do you know how to stay safe while using consumer fireworks? 

 

The Fourth of July is a time to celebrate, spend time with family and friends, and just have fun! Often, fireworks are a part of this annual celebration, but according to the National Fire Protection Association , thousands of people are injured each year while using consumer fireworks. Most often injured are children and teens. Take it upon yourself to learn about fireworks safety so you can protect your family this Fourth. Here are some basic fireworks safety tips to keep in mind:

 Be sure to read and follow all the instruction on the firework labels Never re-light a dud firework Keep a bucket of water and/or a hose handy while using fireworks Never aim or throw fireworks toward anyone Do not allow children to use, play with or light fireworks Only light one firework at a time and move away quickly after lighting Do not allow children to pick up the used fireworks, as they may still be hot 

 Sparklers 
Sparklers are not&quot;safer&quot;fireworks–they can actually reach a temperature of more than 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to cause third-degree burns. It is recommended that only children age 12 or older use sparklers. Follow these tips to keep kids safe:

 Only light one at a time Wear closed-toe shoes Keep the sparkler held out at arm&apos;s length Put used sparklers in a bucket of water Do not wave or throw them 

Still want more information on keeping your family safe this Fourth? Visit our Health Library to check out the section on Fireworks Safety.

 Aging+ Orthopedic Issues 
 June 12, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
The simple act of aging can have a significant impact on bones and joints. As you age, you may find yourself dealing with either or both of these common orthopedic issues .

 

 Osteoarthritis 
 Osteoarthritis , the most common form of arthritis, is a result of cartilage and joints deteriorating with age. The disease mostly affects people 45 and older, and can cause pain and stiffness in hands, hips, knees, shoulders and other areas of the body. In mild cases, treatment for osteoarthritis may involve simply making lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and effectively managing stress. In more serious cases, treatment may include medications to reduce inflammation and relive pain, or joint replacement surgery.

 Osteoporosis 
 Osteoporosis causes aging bones to weaken and become brittle. This can cause bones to break easily, sometimes as a result of simply bending, coughing or sneezing. Consuming enough calcium and vitamin D is important for bone health. The National Osteoporosis Foundation advises people from 19 to 50 years of age to get 1,000 milligrams of calcium and between 400 and 800 international units of vitamin D daily, and those 50 and older to get 1,200 milligrams of calcium and between 800 and 1,000 international units of vitamin D daily. In addition, strength-training and weight-bearing exercises are also important for bone health. Exercises that make the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine bear most of your weight—such as lifting weights and walking—are most beneficial. Treatment for osteoporosis often includes medication to help slow the progression of the disease.

To learn more about orthopedic issues and how you can stay healthy as you age, visit us online at Central Florida Regional Hospital or call our free 24-hour Consult-A-Nurse® service at 1-800-445-3392.

 8 Ways to Beat The Summer Heat 
 June 6, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 There are plenty of ways to combat the summer heat when it beats down and threatens to make you lose your cool. 

 

When temperatures soar, it is important to remember that summer heat and sun can be dangerous to your health. Although extreme heat leads to hundreds of deaths each year, many are preventable. Here are some great tips for&quot;staying cool&quot;and preventing heat-related illness:

 Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate! 
Drink plenty of water and fluids before, during and after spending time in the heat, and consider drinking sports drinks to replace the salts and minerals that are lost in sweat.

 Avoid the Sun During Peak Hours 
The sun is at its strongest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

 Cover Up 
Wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses to cover up the delicate eye and neck areas.

 Lather on the SPF 
If you can&apos;t avoid going in the sun, use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 and reapply every 2 hours.

 Wear the Right Clothes 
Light-colored, loose-fitting clothes will keep you cool. Natural fabrics like cotton are cooler than synthetics.

 Seek Shade 
When possible, take breaks from direct sunlight by seeking shade indoors or under an umbrella, tent or pavilion.

 Don&apos;t Brave it Alone 
If you&apos;ll be spending time in the hot weather, especially if for sports or physical activity, make sure you have a buddy with you. If something happens, someone will be there to help.

 Keep Cool with a Fan 
A quick way to cool down after being in the heat is to sit under or in front of a fan or by taking a cool (not cold) shower.

 Guide to Lowering High Blood Pressure 
 May 29, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 High blood pressure , also sometimes referred to as hypertension, affects approximately one in every three adults in the United States.

 

High blood pressure can injure vascular walls, make your heart pump harder, and prevent tissue in the body from receiving adequate amounts of oxygen-rich blood. Possible consequences of untreated high blood pressure include heart disease, heart attack, stroke, kidney damage, erectile dysfunction, vision loss and more. Here are some things you can do to help lower your high blood pressure :

•Eat a healthy diet. The DASH diet is often recommended for people looking to lower high blood pressure.

•Exercise. The American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity at least 5 days a week. And you can even break your exercise sessions into 10-minute intervals. Talk with your doctor before starting an exercise program.

•Maintain a healthy weight. Calculate your body mass index, or BMI , and discuss the definition of a healthy weight with your doctor.

•Limit alcohol consumption. Women are advised to have no more than one drink per day, while it’s recommended that men have no more than two.

•Don’t smoke. Smoking is detrimental to blood vessels. If you smoke, make a plan to quit .

•Find effective ways to manage stress. Try journaling, meditating, practicing yoga, or find other healthy outlets for managing daily stresses.

•Talk with your doctor about prescription medication to help reduce your blood pressure. Remember that medications often have side effects, and that even if your doctor recommends medication it will likely be in addition to making healthy lifestyle changes.

To learn more about hypertension, including ways to lower your high blood pressure, visit Central Florida Regional Hospital online or call our Consult-A-Nurse®service at 1-800-445-3392.

 Sun Safety Tips + New FDA Sunscreen Rules 
 May 22, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
There’s just something about that Florida sunshine! But do you know how hazardous our dear sunshine can be to our health?  Exposure to the sun’s harmful ultra violet radiation can increase the risk of skin cancer.

 

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation , just one or more severe sunburns in childhood or adolescence can double your chance of developing melanoma later on in life. Can’t do without your Florida sunshine? That’s OK–there are plenty of ways to protect yourself while having fun in the sun. Here are some sun safety tips to guard yourself and your family!

 Cover Up 
Cover up by wearing the right clothing: loose-fitting, light-colored clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

 Lather Up 
Apply sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. See the video below to learn more about sun protection from sunscreen.

 Reapply 
Applying sunscreen is the first step, but reapplying is important too. Be sure to reapply every 2 hours or after swimming or breaking a sweat.

 Seek Shade 
If you’ll be spending time in the sun, especially during the hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., seek shade when you need a break. A tent, picnic shelter or umbrella can provide a reprieve from the sun . 

The FDA recently made some changes that require sunscreen products to be labeled differently to clarify the effectiveness of the products. Learn more by watching the video below:

 Get Moving for Better Health 
 May 15, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
 Wondering what you can do to foster wellness? Chances are if you get moving, you’ll enjoy better health . Numerous studies have proven a link between regular exercise and an array of health benefits . Perks can include living longer, improved mental health, a decrease in back troubles and blood pressure, as well as a lower risk of diseases including osteoporosis, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and more. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate intensity aerobic exercise every week, along with doing muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days a week.

• How does it work? Regular exercise helps control weight, stimulate endorphins, deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues of the body, build muscle, promote quality sleep and more.

• What to do? The goals of exercise are to raise your heart rate and burn calories; and in addition strive to build muscle and increase your strength, endurance and flexibility. With that in mind, broaden your definition of exercise, and do something you enjoy. Aside from activities such as running, bicycling and swimming, consider yoga, Pilates, dancing, water aerobics, golf and more.

• How to start? You might start simply by walking . Gradually increase duration and intensity. Or consider working with a personal trainer for individualized attention and guidance.

• How to stick with it? Tricks that can help prevent you from becoming bored or loosing motivation include taking up a new activity every couple of months, exercising with a friend or joining an exercise club, or training for a race or fitness event.

To learn more about the health benefits associated with exercising, or to schedule an appointment to get a doctor’s advice on beginning a fitness program, call Central Florida Regional Hospital’s free Consult-A-Nurse® service at 1-800-445-3392.

 Breastfeeding Tips for the Working Mom 
 May 8, 2012 | Posted by laicos 
Have you made the important decision to breastfeed your newborn baby? According to Womenshealth.gov , there are several benefits to breastfeeding, including benefits for both mom and baby. Breast milk is nutrient and antioxidant rich, can help fight disease in infants and may be easier to digest than formula. For moms, breastfeeding can lower your risk for certain diseases, make you feel great, help you save money and eve n make life easier. But for working moms, that may not seem like the case. Here are some tips for continuing breastfeeding, even after maternity leave is over.

 Talk to Your Employer 
Before returning to work, talk to your employer about your decision to continue breastfeeding while working. Your supervisor may suggest a particular place for your to go to pump, and can help you with scheduling your breaks for pumping. You may also want to connect with a coworker who previously breastfed at work and can give you tips and advice.

 I nvest In a Good Pump 
 A good electric pump that allows you to pump from both breasts at the same time will help reduce the time you need to pump during work.

 Properly Store Milk 
Be sure that you have a means to properly store your breast milk while you are at work. A lunch box inside of the fridge, or a mini cooler with ice packs can work for storage.

 Breastfeed When You Are Home 
When you do have the opportunity to breastfeed your baby –in the mornings and evenings before and after work, make sure you do and save pumped breast milk for times when you are away or your baby is at childcare.

 Find a Private Area to Pump 
If your office does not have a specified breastfeeding lounge, work with your employer to find a location that will suit your needs. An office with a door , a small unused storage space or a closed conference room can work for a private space.

 Keep a Pumping Schedule 
While you are at work, you should pump every two to three hours , ideally. This should provide enough supply of milk for your baby to drink while you are at work and will keep your milk supply up enough that you can nurse your baby in the morning and evening.

For more information on the benefits of breastfeeding, visit us online at Central Florida Regional Hospital or call our free Consult-A-Nurse®Service at 1-800-445-3392 for health information and physician referrals.
