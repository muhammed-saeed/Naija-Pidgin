 Reviews For Hardees Corporate Office 

 Robert Dimaso 7/4/12 
 NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER eat at the Hardees in Kernersville! Their resturant is filthy, the cashier, is rudeand the manager is rude as all get out. I like Hardees burgers but I am done paying for a lack of service and rudeness. In todays economy I dont think Hardees can survive with such poor service. Maybe they can, but they have sure lost mine. 



 Erica Goodson 7/5/12 
 Hardee&apos;s on Ann Street in Montgomery, Alabama is the worst that I have ever experienced. Extremely long waits for terrible food&amp;bad attitudes. The girl played in her hair the whole time
 



 A. Graham 6/1/12 
 With the current horde of unemployed out there you would think Hardees would make an effort to hire some managers that actually know how to run something instead of the incompetent boobs that are apparently in charge. The Peter Principle must be rampant in their corporate structure.

They spend money out the wazoo for commercials trying to get you to buy the crap they serve and then when you do go in the places are dirty, service is non-existent and the majority of the employees obviously rode the short bus to work.

I&apos;ve wasted my time and money there for the last time. 



 anthony 6/5/12 
 we are loyal customers of your restaurant.we are also faithful Christians WITH good morals like a restaurant would expect its workers to have,and good values that satisfies customers that restaurant teach to their employees.we are sad to see that you have decided to use porn to sell your food,and decide that your CHRISTIAN customers should support you as you change from good principles to bad principles which does not reflect our values.we are commanded in the HOLY BIBLE not too SUPPORT WRONG.WE CAN NOT CONTINUE TO SHOP AT YOUR STORES IF YOU CHOSE TO HOLD ONTO THESE BAD VALUES. THANK YOU.

 Hardees in Saltillo ms has by far the worst group of people working there. They were talking about how drunk they got and how they went dancing the night before over the drive thru speaker then laughed in my face as I tried to order. I will never again go there and I WILL tell about my poor experience all over Facebook and twitter for thousands to see 



 Katrinia Echols 6/15/12

 Went to the Hardees in Andrews NC tonight. I can tell you I will never go back. An employee working tonight was rude to the customers and not just me. I&apos;m talking about all the customers. Some were going back to get their money back. We were a group of ten, and had been standing in line for 15 to 20 minutes just to place our order. The employees name was Teresa. We had to ask her to take our order. Then she said we had attitude because we wanted her to take our order. She had just been sanding there making rude comments and using some bad language in front of us and all the young children. We were not the only people in line wanting to order. After she did take our orders she started slamming the cash drawer and people were having to ask for their change back. I&apos;ve worked in the food service many years and you never treat your customers this way. When customers started asking for their money back that they did not want their orders because they had been waiting for over 45 minutes this is not good for business. Seems to me this could be a management problem. It might be time to go in and clean house. 06/15/2012 



 Kristina 6/17/12 
 It is a shame how I have seen the shift leaders and managers treat there help ...I see the people in the back working very very hard and the front people standing there always talking bad or yelling at the help .no wonder they are losing customers,I just want to relax and have a burger not deal with all the personal problems ,if there is a problem with staff it should be handled after work and not in front of the guests.....rockwood tn hardees needs to really take a good look at there business 



 Glen Miller 7/3/12 
 At this time i would not even give you a 1 for the Chesterfield, MO location. I went there for lunch today and guess what I never got my food. I waited at first over 30 minutes and I went to ask the cashier about my lunch and he said it would be there shortly. I said okay, that was my mistake. About 10 minutes later I went to ask again about my lunch. They had basically lost my lunch ticket. Another customer came up and complained along with me and he had been waiting over an hour for his lunch. She offered him his money back while offering me nothing. The manager told us both that they were short of help and was behind. I can understand that but a fast food place, no way. The fact that this was her excuse to have peole wating this long is not good business. After anotther 5 minutes or so, I asked the cashier again if they were making my lunch and hecould not anser me. At that time I basically told him to take my food and money and shove it. I won&apos;s expand upon that.

I will never set foot in another Hardees as long as I live and I definitely will not recommend it to anyone else. This is not the first time I have heard complaints about this Hardees. I hope it closes down entirely and if this is the way corporate does business I have nothing to say to any of you. 



 MW Lane 6/21/12 
 I hope you have stopped the drive in commercials on all channels and never go to that bottom of the barrel degree again to sell a burger!!!!

I miss my gravy biscuits (several times a week)...and other items off your menu, but since that commercial....forget my business....and others I shared it with were offended I believe they stopped going there also....

No stars unless you clean up you advertising act!! Thank you for hearing me out! 



 diane turner 6/24/12 
 I was given employment to start a job on June 23 2012. I was asked to so come in at three and work till 11. Okay, I was good with that until my shift manager didn&apos;t show up until 3:15 with the store opening at 4. My store manager comes in round eight and tells me how disappointed she was in her morning crew. Keep in mind this is my first day and she is telling how disappointed she is looking eye to eye with me. The rest of the day is total chaos. The following morning I was asked to come back in and work the morning shift,so I say okay. This morning I arrive at 2:50 am, I sit and I wait till 3:15 wrote a note and went back home. If I&apos;m scheduled to come in at a certain time I will be on time. At three am I&apos;d rather keep my pride instead of working for 7.25 a hour, to get ridiculed, when I never had anything to do with main issue. 



 Emily 6/24/12 
 I&apos;m writing with a complaint. I went to our local Hardees in Gloucester Virginia today and was told that you no longer carry the chicken filet sandwich....it has been replaced with a chicken finger sandwich.....my only question is WHY????? Even the girl at the window said many people have been complaining about your removal of the sandwich from the menu. Why in the world would you take a good thing off the menu, I&apos;m sure it was a big seller.....So, corporate, my question is WHY? 



 6/28/12 
 The new chicken tender sandwich. Would you like to know the truth? A women died from food poisoning in North Carolina. The company no longer buys fillets from that supplier, instead they use tenders for the new sandwich and market it as a better tasting sandwich. Don&apos;t believe everything you hear.
 



 CHUCK BRITTO 5/6/12 
 WHY CAN&apos;T I GET BREAKFAST COUPONS WITHOUT HAVING A MOBILE/CELL PHONE? I AM A
78 YR OLD MILITARY VETERAN (21 YRS TO MY COUNTRY - USA) AND AM 100% SERVICE
CONNECTED DISABLED AND ON A FIXED INCOME. THEREFORE, I USE SPECIAL OFFER COUPONS
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. NORMALLY, I SPEND ABOUT $10. WEEKLY A HARDEES.
IT APPEARS I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SPECIAL OFFERS, OTHER THAN WHEN I CUT
A COUPON OUT OF A SUNDAY NEWSPAPER? 



 Connor 5/7/12 
 I went to Hardees today and I just got back and everything is fine with my food. But one thing. When I went to order I asked for a small Coke and they said &quot;We don&apos;t have small.&quot;. I just thought at that moment WTF why do you not have a small size 



 sw 5/24/12 
 Hardees should be ashamed of theyself
The way the big managers talk to the employees is just pitiful. I have seen an excellent employee get talk like she was nothing. That is how company&apos;s loose good employees. Noone deserve to be treated like that. That lady should be removed from the company. This is not the first time she has done this. I have heard her curse out the staff in front of customers. Something needs to be done about this. Really something needs to be done. They have a good crew but that district manager needs to go. She don&apos;t know how to talk to people. This messes up the company image.

 



 Sarah 5/9/12 
 I am also writing to complain about Hardee&apos;s they just opened a new store in love spark Illinois on riverside and it is horrible. I have went there 5 times and the service is so poor. The explanation given to us is that they are still training. Why if you are not ready to open would you open. The people workings in there act like they are so busy and they have not a clue to what they are doing.
It is fast food I worked in fast food when I was a teenager if you have a good manager than you don&apos;t have the incompetent issues that they do.
I waited last time for 7 minutes behind one car and no one was ahead of this car. The person taking the order left the speaker several times to come back and then reasked about what this person had already ordered.
It was to the point of ridiculous I finally yelled out and repeated the order that this person had told this worker several times already.
The people in the car were disgusted as well. I complained and they said maybe I shouldn&apos;t come back.
Prior to this we had gone there and during every occasion something was wrong. No fries in our order we payed for had to go back and wait for ever. Then the window worker stuck her face in our bag. The roast beef sandwich had hardly any roast beef and I was asked to pay twice after I had already payed. So I called a number on the window and told of my experiences. It will probably not make a difference. But businesses used to mean something in our country at one time this is just a example of the declining America.
I have never made a complaint like this before I mean after all this is really so trivial to life, but today I just had enough of lazy, poor services and people not caring or doing their jobs. 



 Ashley Miller 5/10/12 
 I thought you guys were done showing that movie theater commercial! There is NOTHING about a girl getting an orgasim over a burger that makes me crave your burgers. Do you know how many children watch your commercials?Maybe you should think about that. I&apos;d rate you 0 stars if that was a choice. No girl getting kinky with a burger deserves a star at all. CLEAN UP YOUR ACT! 



 karla vinson 5/12/12 
 Get new material for your commercials. My family and I don&apos;t want to see your sex commercials. I would not even consider eating at your restaurant because of your advertisement. I hope others agree and you all go bankrupt. 



 DL Smith 5/15/12 
 Went to Hardees today to order lunch. Was being charged 10 cents more for sandwich than the price posted on the drive through signs. Brought this to the store&apos;s attention and NOTHING would be done to charge me the correct price. Left without placing my order and went to another restaurant. How ignorant to lose a $10 sale for a dime. *smh* 

 

 Don Hickerson 5/16/12 
 It seems that some of your customers are quite upset over your new commerical. I will have to admit that it was somewhat out of character for your restaurant.

I have been a hardees lover ever since the early 60&apos;s on my trips to Fl. on vacation, sometimes driving 40 miles or more to eat your breakfast. I would like to see less emphasis on hamburgers and more on your biscuits and gravy etc. Your breakfast is what you are known for and if Bojangles and Popeyes can serve biscuits all the hours they are open, then you all could do the same. I love a hardees breakfast 24 hour a day.

In this part of the country in Tn. my experience with Hardees has always been very pleasant, with the exception of the Hardees store in Hendersonville causing it to close about 12 years ago with sorry management and kids having food fights on the evening shift. A group of thug kids misbehaving selling drugs openly etc. apparently was more than your company could overcome. To get a hardees breakfast now I have to drive to Goodlettsville or Gallatin to get my favorite biscuits and breakfast. Both of these stores stay covered up and that is the way the Hendersonville store was until a great manager a Ms.

Woodard was the manager and your company put a person over her that had no management skills and liked to play instead of doing his job. That is when the down fall of your store begin to decline. I run across people every day wishing your company would locate here again and love Hardees breakfast. I would venture to say your store here in the right location would give your other stores a run for their money with the right management and right employees.

If you got serious, you would need to step up the salary for a manager in this town, as this is one of the fastest growing cities in the state, along with paying your employees a little more, as the cost of living here is quite higher than the 2 cities mentioned above and rent or to buy property will cost more.

I have heard rumors that your company regrets closing this location. I have lived here for 46 years and this is one of the finest places to live in the state as well as other states. Your company should seriously think about a trial store with breakfast around the clock and this would be a great location for that trial. We have many people partying in Nashville coming home, but not reallly ready to go home and would like a store to eat breakfast late in the evening or 2-3 am especially on the weekends.

I respectfully thank you for your time and after reading some of their comments, your company could use some good comments. Thank you for you time and review of my post. 



 Natalie 4/26/12 
 I have been going to Hardees in Carterville, Il. for many years. The last 2 times I went the service was horrible. The first time I ordered the Frisco melt and it took 26 min. to get it. This time I ordered the Taco Salad and got the bowl it should come in only about 1/3 full of very wet lettuce and sparse toppings. No dressing to go on it. HORRIBLE!!!!!!! 



 Linda 3/2/12 
 Somehow, some way, I am going to be in touch with the person/persons that okayed such a disgusting, pornographic commercial. What&apos;s the matter with you people???? I am still in shock ... total shock! I definitely will be in touch with the shows (in our case, the KCTV5 news) that allowed such filth to sponsor the newscast and then I&apos;m going on from there. HORRIBLE, just horrible! 



 Sheva 5/2/12 
 I went to Hardee&apos;s at 940 Thornton Rd, Lithia Springs, GA 30122 on or around 12-18-2011. We ordered breakfast sandwiches at the drive thru window. Once we left and started eating I noticed that we were eating raw dough and meat. I called back to complain and spoke with Sheila(mgr on that shift) and she apologized and asked us to come back to get them replaced. I declined based on the current situation. Later on, my family and I(4 year old son, 1 year old daughter and fiance&apos;) became very ill. We all had to go to the emergency room for severe vomiting, diarrhea and high fevers. I made the claims on the following Monday not expecting anything to come from it but to let them know what they caused. The corporate office called their insurance company. Debra(claims adjuster with Traveler&apos;s) called and from the start she had a biased attitude. She was very unprofessional and basically unconcerned. She stated that it had to be investigated. 5 months later its still being investigated. Today she calls and states that they denied the claim because the ER didn&apos;t do a stool test on us so we can&apos;t prove that their client is negligent. Now, we have hospital bills in collections. I have found about 3 different employees(former and current) willing to admit that that&apos;s what they do. To testify that this Hardees serves half cooked food all the time, that their cooking and serving environment is unsanitary and YES, I now have pictures showing some pretty disgusting hazards(I have more behind the scenes photos). Now I have to get a lawyer and all this is for what? A company that doesn&apos;t want to honor and fix their wrongs? Sad. People need to know what they are eating when they eat here. Employess are even disgusted and ready to talk.

 Jerry Morton 5/2/12 
 I am very upset with your store#12 the girl was at register#4, we stood in line for a long time then she finally took our order party of 2 she said take a number I will bering your food out when its ready, well sat and waited for about 15 to 20 minutes and it hadn&apos;t come and people that come in after we did was getting their food and we wasn&apos;t, I went up to ask her where was my order she said --oh it didn&apos;t show up in the back screen then we had to wait for it to be fixed and they give me the wrong sandwich,that I didn&apos;t ordered. I didn&apos;t say anything or we would have had to wait another long period again. She didn&apos;t say anything when she brought it to our table she sat it down and picked up the number and walked off, no I&apos;m sorry or anything. This store needs some prompt attention. I doubt I will go to Hardee&apos;s again with that kind of service. 



 Denise Hansen 4/15/12 
 I give you no stars at all. I work for a living and often get food from Hardees for clients that are home bound. The food is always cold and prepared, and you dont get what you ordered,but bacause you are in the drive thru and dont really have time to wait. The line is long and waiting a half or better for food. I gave my number to the manager to call me they never did. I choose to never eat your food for ever. I will go somewhere else. There is never enough help there thru the week and weekends as well. I have worked in food service before, so no excuse will do. I wish i could get my money back. So my bet is you will not contact me as well because that is how you operate. 



 Michael 4/10/12 
 I used to love going to Hardees, I thought you had the best burger in town but my opinion of you has changed as your menue and service has changed. You now sell one of the dryest burgers or your people dont know how to cook. All the people I was used to seeing are gone and new people keep showing up. You are losing me again as a customer. If you dont care if you lose old customers then keep up the lousy work. By the way when you advertise grilled onions on your Patty Melt that does not meen heated in the Microwave. As for Angus beef it means nothing if they are cooked dry and tastless. Hardees really and truly now sucks as a burger joint right down there with Mcdouches. 



 Sad and Lonely 3/31/12 
 Dear Hardees,

I am normally not the kind of person to complain, but I think this issue does not only affect me, but many other would-be customers who have been wrongly mislead by advertising and the media on your front.

I feel that the product Hardees advertises and the product they deliver do not correspond in even the most minute sense of understanding. I for one feel deceived by the claims made in your most recent commercial (and prior), and was placed in a situation of extreme embarrassment and belittlement when speaking with a young female employee at the front counter.

To be fair, most bluntly, I thought you were an escort service.

There was nobody else in the &quot;restaurant&quot; but me. As I approached the counter I flashed my wad of cash and announced that I wanted to buy a &apos;perky blonde one who looks like the girl on tv&apos;. At the same time, the cashier welcomed me and offered me a burger.

...

That awkward silence lasted forever.

I turned around in a quick stride to leave the way I came, as speechless as the employees who heard. I could hear them burst into laughter behind me as the door was closing. Now that I know you sell burgers, that would have been convenient, but nevertheless I will not be returning -- not after that incident.

I feel I was truly, wrongly mislead. Twenty-five seconds of cleavage and inner-thigh camera-shots while a scantly-clad woman enjoys eating a burger does not at all appear to be selling the burger. I have been told that at the end of the commercial, you get to see the burger for about five seconds -- but it was boobs that got my attention in the first place, and being the average consumer, I lost all interest when the boobs disappeared.

I would really hate to see this happen to others who unwittingly fall into the depths of Hardees&apos; advertising sex-traps. For this, I think it is only fair that you owe the general public an apology for your false advertising, and for the future, make it clear what you are trying to sell. I hold high positions in my community and in the development of the New World Order, and my reputation will undoubtedly suffer tremendously. For these damages I will not seek monetary recompense, but I do think it proper that I at least receive a free hat, a t-shirt, a mug, and any other Hardees paraphernalia that you can spare.

This is a lot lengthier than I had intended, but I thank everybody for reading, as well as Hardees, should they choose to change their ways and compensate me with aforementioned items. I believe it was important to get my message out -- and better yet I have an audience however small, who can perhaps answer a question that has been burning in my mind for weeks now. Although this may not be proper venue, I need to know -- what is a troll? 



 Ricardo moltaband 3/24/12 
 2 complaints your store in Newberry fl. service sucks people in restaurant don,t give a sh** playing carrying on took 20 min to get 2 hambergers #7 on menu they suck -- Brand new restaurant on 26 just west of i-75 used to B a whataberger went to get a strawberry milk shake nada supposewdely the machine is broke what no backup common Hardee,s can,y U do better than that even Berger King has backup. sucks I really wanted that strawberry milkshake sucks won,t go there again probally won,t have bread for the hambergers&amp;I am not eating a hamberger without bread. 



 M Short 3/17/12 
 I do not understand what a woman holding her crotch has to do with selling hamburgers. These Hardees commercials are appalling and a slap in the face to females. It is a shame that Hardees have had to use such nasty tactics to sell their food. I guess it is time to start voicing our complaints to the carriers directly and boycott this chain of restaurants. 



 Kathleen Delaney Koppang 3/10/12 
 I am so glad to see the many disgusted comments on your new commercial. I am the grandmother of 8. Is there something in this commercial that is supposed to encourage me to bring them, or myself, to your restaurant? Not a chance. I do not usually comment on commercials or much of anything, but this is simply not acceptable. If you only want to attract teen age boys, you may have succeeded, but my grandsons won&apos;t go there. Neither will my granddaughters, or will I. My daughters all agaree. We are done with Hardee&apos;s. I markde you with one star because it was as low as I could goi. If I could have given you a no star, I would have. 



 Dianna Fulk 3/10/12 
 Hardees is the buzz on facebook. Not because of their good turkey burgers that I used to love, but because of your inappropiate commercials!!! FYI, there are kids who watch TV too. I&apos;m done with Hardees, this happened a few years ago and we quit going to Hardees and it&apos;s my husband&apos;s favorite. We just started eating there again about 6 months ago. Now it&apos;s happening again. You are NASTY!!!!! 



 Linda Gibson Spanish Fort, Alabama 3/14/12 
 I am thoroughly disgusted with the commercial featuring what appears to be a woman about to masturbate because she is so aroused by A HAMBURGER! I am so disappointed in Hardee&apos;s. Their P.R. staff ought to have their butts kicked, I mean it! Aren&apos;t things bad enough already in our country? Do we want our children to see this? NO! I was in the room alone when I saw it and it embarrassed me. Do perverted people need to see this too? They already have had an eye full which feeds their sickness. I will not go to Hardee&apos;s anymore. I will encourage everyone I know to boycott them. 



 Disgusted Denise 3/8/12 
 The recent Hardees advertisement for the new HOT burger is critically in need of soap and water, maybe some Holy Water. What were you thinking when you hired the advertising team? Were they 15 year old boys still hanging out in daddy&apos;s garage? That piece of filth airs several times during the local evening newscast so it&apos;s difficult to miss. Leave the advertising choices to people who are old enough to at least get a driver&apos;s license and put the pornography where it belongs, in the trash. It certainly didn&apos;t entice me to run over to Hardees and buy a burger and there are far too many fast food choices so avoiding yours is no hardship.
Your commercial stinks, your &quot;theory&quot; on using the commercial has a lot of holes in it and your morals are non-existent.
What was this young woman thinking when she agreed to act like trash in front of a camera? Her parents must be so proud of her.....not. 



 Msh 3/6/12 
 Please be responsible and remove your new commercial from the airways and fire your current advertising team and replace them with people of character who care about your bottom dollar as well as preserving morality and character in US advertising. I am so sick of seeing bare bodies (female and male) being used to sell everything. However, there is something inherently disgusting about using sex to sell food. You are exploiting women, exposing children to things they should not be seeing during prime time TV, and ruining the reputation of Hardee&apos;s as a family restaurant. You state you are trying to reach young hungry guys. Let&apos;s see - 1 family with 3 kids = 5 meals several times a week - 1 hungry guy = 1 meal. Unless you have the nude star in your local store - the hamburger won&apos;t drag him in. You are all wrong Hardee&apos;s. Please rethink this. 



 Mike&amp;Kim Mooney 3/6/12 
 Please remove your pornographic commercial ASAP . I and several of my friends will boycott Hardees. We are sick of the commercials that are bent on selling sex with hamburgers. Do you really think that filth sells more burgers? I will encourage my family and friends to boycott Hardees until you clean up the filth! We have enough problems with our kids growing up to fast because of all the things the see on TV and this just adds to it. Do you let your children watch this stuff?
If you have any integrity you will drop this sick pursuit of filling our family&apos;s heads with porn.
You may not realize this but all of you who take part who contribute to this garbage will be judged. Is this the kind of stuff you want to take with you to meet God. I hope not, for your sake! 



 Char Stevens 3/5/12 
 I will no longer purchase food from you folks..your commercial makes it plain to me what the execs think about women and I am insulted. I will drive right on by and honk as I go just to let your staff know they may not have a job soon due to the decisions their top management is making. Your execs may not listen to my voice but your employees will listen to my horn, your employees should bail as soon as they can find another job. 



 christina 3/5/12 
 -Why didnt you post my last two comments??? This is just a sounding board for people to post their complaints but they never make it to Hardees. It states that at the bottom of the page. I guess most people dont read that since they see Hardees Corporate office headquarters at the top of the page.Very Clever. It seems you are worried about posting the actual web site for people to complain so maybe I will just keep adding messages until you post one. I did get in touch with hardees and voiced my complaint about there advertising however I&apos;m sure it wont change anything. BUT THIS SITE IS CRAP!!!!!! YOU WONT EVEN POST MY FIRST TWO -MESSGAES!!!!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!! ***********IF YOU WANT YOU VOICE HEARD YOU MUST CONTACT HARDEES.COM/CONTACT OR CALL 877-799-7827. iTS OK...IF YOU DONT POST THIS...I&apos;LL KEEP WRITING AND POST IT ON FACEBOOK...MAYBE START A PAGE ABOUT HARDEES....THERES AND IDEA 



 Alicia 3/5/12 
 I am so relieved that other people feel the same way I do. This is soft porn on prime time. Talk about pushing the envelope. I am so sick of have to hold the remote and being afraid that junk like this is going to be seen by my family. It really ruins the mood when we are having family and enjoying a movie on TV.

I FOUND A PETITION ON CHANGE.ORG (Just search under Hardees)

I would like to encourage all of you to sign the petition. It&apos;s worked before and mayybe together there will be change. Hopefully a news station will pick this up and stop those stupid ads. Personally, I have one very close to me and they will never see my face in there. 



 Debbie 3/1/12 
 I have just contacted Hardees consumer offices by phone- 877- 799- 7827 and spoke to a reasonable sounding man about the commercial that my husband and I were forced to view last night...sexy is fine but the breasts and suggestive positioning of the young woman was something for porn or the bedroom only. Sensationalism does sell- but shouldn&apos;t be allowed at the hour in which we viewed this insult to women(8-8:30pm) I asked the rep to please relay my feelings along apparently with many others as evidenced by the above reviews. I will contact WLOS, my cable advertisers and any one who will listen. Perhaps Change.com would be good to address this issue. Please call the corporate # above and let them know how you feel. 

 

 Martha Malone 3/1/12 
 Dear Hardees Corporate Office:

After enjoying all of your goofy, silly ads about Black Angus thickburgers, and all of those that preceeded them, I never thought I would see this day. I am apalled at your latest ad for the Japaleno Thickburger and &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;. What were you thinking? It borders on X rated! Also, the commercial airs during the day and Prime Time when kids and teens are watching.

Really, that thing has got to go. Aren&apos;t we assaulted with enough erotica on TV and the movies already? Your food is good enough that you don&apos;t have to do that. If you want to sell hamburgers, especially to families, you&apos;d better burn that commercial - unless, of course, it self-ignites from spontaneous combustion, which is entirely possible. 



 Ron 3/1/12 
 I am embarrassed and ashamed to admit that I have enjoyed my visits to what I thought was a family friendly restaurant. It seems that that is no longer the case.
The recent ad, porn commerical, for Hardees is absolutely inappropriate and not something I wish to be a part of, or have my family be a part of. Therefore, I will be taking my business elsewhere and that of as many people as I can encourage to do the same. It seems someone&apos;s intelligence was left at home, if they had any at all. Perhaps Hardee&apos;s has gotten caught up in all the other greed in our world and does not care about children and the influence places like Hardees has on them. What a disappointment! 



 Glenda 3/1/12 
 Please take your filthy commercial off the air. It is sad to see that you have stooped to this level. I really don&apos;t think it will sell more burgers or anything else. It would serve the restaurant right if the commercial put you out of business. I just don&apos;t appreciate the commercial. The next thing that should air concerning Hardees is an apology from the Corporate Headquarters for allowing something like that to promote their food. I expected more decency from Hardees. 



 Sherry 3/2/12 
 To Whom It May Concern:

Irecently had the misfortune to view one of your commercials and was saddened that Hardees would stoop to this level. We place filters on the internet and try everything we can to protect our children from what we witnessed regarding your latest commercial. I was in Haiti recently, and a young Haitian was asking me pointed questions regarding the morality of America. I think, unfortunately your commercial reveals alot of the reason other countries question our morality. Unless I see a public apology from Hardees I will never eat in another restaurant with anything to do with Hardees. This is my first time to ever post anything like this.

 Shan Register 3/2/12 
 I am totally disgusted by the latest Hardee&apos;s commercial. It looks like an advertisement for a port star than a food commercial. The commercial is in extremely poor taste, and I would be appalled for my grand-daughters to see it. I do not think I have ever been so offended by a commercial. It needs to be removed immediately!!! If not, Hardees will never receive any of my business again. 



 A. Taylor 3/2/12 
 Not sure how Hardee&apos;s gets away with these sexual commercials. I would be so embarrassed to be watching TV with my family and one of them come on. I wonder how many have been abused after someone watches that has a weakness in this area. It is obvious you don&apos;t care and have no intention of stopping them since they began a while back. It is a shame what a company will do to get business however I am sure it is costing you business too, I know I won&apos;t eat there. 



 A. Rick 3/2/12 
 Your new &quot;soft porn&quot; television commercial is downright nasty. Seriously. Even if I was interested in the new &quot;hot&quot; thickburger, I&apos;m not interested now. Gag. Good Job on taking a very simple concept, selling a hamburger, and turning it into a nauseating, sex-filled ad. Showing consumers too much sexual content is like feeding someone too much cake. After awhile, even the thought of it becomes just disgusting. I have a great idea for you: Fire your entire Advertising Department, hire some people with real talent, and put out some decent ads. One that will actually make people want to purchase your product. 



 Carol 3/2/12 
 Your recent ad explointing a young lady having sexual and erotic moments with a hamburger is disgusting. I beg you to pull that ad immediately. This is what is wrong with all the current ads....no one puts any limitations on how to sell their product. I will never go to Hardees again! I hope many others who have seen this commercial feel the same way and discontinue their purchase of any products from your franchise. I could not believe what I was seeing. You should be ashamed! I am spreading the word about this commercial so I hope you receive a flood of reviews from your customers who will no longer be your customers! 



 A. Barnhill 3/2/12 
 Please remove your pornographic commercial ASAP before any more damage is done. The faster you pull it, the more chance you have at salvaging your business. I&apos;m not sure WHAT audience you thought this would reach but it has done nothing but turn me off. If I never see another Hardees, that will be fine with me. This has just pushed the limit in every way possible. We wonder what is wrong with this world but if a burger commercial can&apos;t even be innocent, what can? 



 Delphna Forrest 3/2/12 
 My complain is about the commercial I seen about a young lady advertising about a hamburger that very hot. you would think it was a porn commercial. What is so sad bout it that we are living in the days that to make a sale, anything goes. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and loses his soul. Young children are watching this commercial, and what is the world coming to. You take prayer out of school, take down the ten commandments, but how no problem putting this mess on t.v. If it was your daughter, would you want her to be in this commercial. How long do we think the creater of this world is going to continue to allow things like thisto continue.. Everyday is grace and mercy, and God truly loves us, and it is his will hat no man be destroy, but God gave every man a free will, but there will be consequences. Heavan is not bankrupted, God is not lacking anything. If you have to do ungodly things to make money, then what is going to happen to wake us up. I pray that we wake up before it is too late, because our children well reap the consequences by the choice make. Jesus said there is a way that seems right to man, but the end is destruction. God have mercy own our souls. If you own a home, do you allow somenone to come in your home and take over, I believe not, so do you think god is going to allow us to do what we want to do in the earth he created. HOW DO YOU TELL THE CREATOR WHO CREATED YOU WHAT TO DO, WHAT IS YOUR LIMITED. WE FEAR GOD MORE THAN WE FEAR MAN. 



 Lester 3/2/12 
 I have been watching your ads for some time now and am troubled with the level you have scooped to to try to sell a hamburger. Now you have crossed over into pornography. I was disgusted last night when I saw your ad come on during a family program. I am glad my sons were not in the room, as I would have been embarrassed. There is a Hardees down the street and I had just cut out your coupons that came in the mail and planned to use them this week. However, I will not go again until you clean up your act and specifically pull this latest ad at the drive-in theater featuring Kate Upton. You may think it is cute, but it is pornographic, exploitive and disrespectful to women. I will be spreading the word to our neighbors and friends to do the same. Please just produce a decent family friendly ad? 



 Susan 3/2/12 
 I am writing because someone who I trust asked me to write to you to complain about a filthy commercial that hardees&apos; has allowed to be put on tv. I can honestly say that I have not seen the commercial because I don&apos;t watch tv. Filth needs to be in the trash can and not on tv. From what I have read about this commercial, you are going to be losing many customers because of their disgust over it being aired on tv. I do not understand how you think a disgusting pornography ad is going to attract or interest people to want to be your customers. What about this ad is going to interest people in wanting to enter a hardees? I do not see the connection. Whoever put this filthy ad together and whoever allowed it to be aired on tv, I honestly do believe all of them have lost the cheese off of their crackers. No, I will still not be one of your customers because of this filthy ad; I haven&apos;t been in a hardees for quite awhile because hardees&apos; has pepsi products and I don&apos;t drink pepsi products because of unethical items they put in their drinks. 



 Brenda Griffith 3/2/12 
 I am joining many others in voicing my outrage over Hardee&apos;s latest commercial. My perspective comes from that of a mother, grandmother and a teacher of young people. I have taught advertising in consumer education and if the only way you can make more money is at the moral expense of our young people, then I will not only NOT patrionize Hardee&apos;s myself but will influence as many people as I can to do the same. I am shocked and disappointed that an establishment I respected would stoop to such low tactics. Check out Chick-filet (even closed on Sunday)---they seem to be making enough. Take some responsibility, please! 



 Kenett Toller 3/2/12 
 disgusting commercial...will not be going to Hardees at all!!!!! I cannot believe you would air such a disgusting ad for all to see. If you have to put out an ad like this with soft porn...air it early in the am when families are not up to see filth like this. I am appalled and will not be doing business with you. If you can make filthy commercials such as this, then your why would a person trust your food to be quality.
Grow up and clean it up!!! 



 ed rohr 3/4/12 
 i use to be a regular at your effingham, il hardee&apos;s. i quit going there. poor service, slow cooks, and rude employees. alot of new faces over the past 2 years. what gives? where did all the good managers go. only see a couple of managers that have been there for awhile. is the gm running them off? they use to have great managers. a few females and 1 guy manager that was very friendly and very quick. delivered great service every time and food was hot and fresh. i cant remember his name, i thnk it started with a c. if i was the management, i would never have let this guy go or many of the other ones. why let someone go when they provide GREAT customer service and always deliver great food. i guess it is hardee&apos;s loss cause another company found them and probably realized what they found and will never let them go. 



 P. Proctor 2/29/12 
 I was sitting alone watching TV (thankfully my children were not there with me) when your soft porn commercial with the young woman at the drive-in behaving in a sexually explicit manner came on. What does this behavior have to do with eating a hot thick hamburger? Nothing. Exactly! What&apos;s wrong with this picture? No decency, prudence, or respect for the family who watch have to watch this filth, the woman you hired for this commercial, or the public in general. I decided last night that I will not be taking our family to Hardee&apos;s anymore. You owe your viewers and customers who care about decency an apology. 



 Margaret 2/29/12 
 Okay, here I go. Either get your latest commercial (PORN) ad pulled from TV or you have lost another customer!!! It is just plain filth&amp;why does a family fast food business have to stoop to this (plain filth) just to sell a hamberger? What is wrong with you people that you thought you could actually get this filthy ad to bring in more business? In case you are not aware of this, we have McDonalds, Wendy&apos;s, Subways&amp;other fast food places that we can go to&amp;if you don&apos;t pull this ad&amp;I use that term loosely, I will write to every newspaper that I can write to&amp;voice my opinion to everyone that will listen to boycott hardees. At this point of my discuss with hardees, you do not even deserve to have a capitol h for your title. We eat there quite often&amp;until this ad is pulled, you will no longer have our business!! You need to fire whoever wrote that ad&amp;get in touch with real life. You do not need to have a barely clothed woman, showing her breasts&amp;appearing to be sexual with herself over a stupid hamburger. But the reality of all of this is that it is your ad department&amp;whoever allowed this filthy ad to be on TV, are really the stupid ones. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OR DO YOU EVEN THINK??? My advice is to pull the ad, fire a few people&amp;give an apology to all of your customers, if you have any left. The longer you leave it on the air, the madder people are going to get&amp;before long, we may no longer have a hardees because WE THE PEOPLE are who you should be listening to instead of some perverated fool thinking you would haul in more business with this filthy porn!! Yes, I&apos;m mad, mad at you for being so stupid to even allow this to be put on the air. SHAME on you hardees, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!!!!! 



 Pam Chitwood 3/1/12 
 I am writing because I had the misfortune of witnessing your latest commercial this week. The evening I was confronted with the images on the screen, I had been watching the 6:30 news with my husband. Before I knew what was happening, I had already been &quot;slimed.&quot; I am a Christian, a mother, and a grandmother. I cannot adequately express to you how vehemently opposed to your commercial I am because it is an attack on people&apos;s minds and their morals! Do you really want to be responsible for leading people to lust after this young woman and to lust after your food? Please reconsider and remove your commercial and clean up your advertising for the sake of children and families! 



 Suzi, Dalton GA 3/1/12 
 I am DISGUSTED by the new commerical!!! If movies and television shows have ratings so we can decide what our children and families are exposed to why on earth does Hardees have the right to decide for us? I was HORRIFIED to have one of the most awkward conversations with my children about a writhing, sweating girl touching herself while eating a HAMBURGER!!! Interestingly if you post on Hardee&apos;s facebook page about this, your comment will be deleted and moved to a &quot;safe&quot; place further down the page. Hardees, you have lost the business of our family forever. Your target audience is not families obviously!!!! 



 Trip 3/1/12 
 To the Corporate Fools at Hardees,
You have finally gone over the top for the most lude, disgusting and disrespectful commercial you have ever placed on TV. What must you be thinking, does this type of thought process really deserve to be placed in front of our children. Your &quot;drive-in commercial&quot; is the most disrespectful thing I have seen in a long time to the women of our country. Just so you know in no uncertain terms you have finally once and for all assured yourself that Hardees is not a family restaurant and we as a family of Christians will NEVER SET FOOT IN ANY HARDEES RESTAURANT AGAIN! IT IS THIS TYPE OF MORAL DECAY THAT IS TURNING OUR COUNTRY INTO A 3RD RATE COUNTRY I NEVER THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HEAD UP THIS SO CALLED BUSINESSS. THERE IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE RESERVED FOR ALL OF YOU. 

 

 s probert 3/1/12 
 I cannot believe you have this commercial on TV. I am so disgusted and for children to see this on TV. This is supposed to be a FAMILY place to eat!! Hah!! I refused to go to Hardees anymore until this commercial is pulled and I am spreading the word to everyone and on facebook also and already everyone I have talked to are not going to Hardees and believe me we frequented the place ALOT.
It is bad enough the shows that are on TV now but this is beyond belief! 



 Sandy 2/28/12 
 I am appalled by your latest commercial that shows a woman with her legs spread and her breasts exposed with the camera showing her in such a sexually explicit position to get people to become aware of HARDEE&quot;S. This is how far coporate america will push with no moral or ethical code today. It is about doing what ever it wants to sell at the expense of youth, mothers and believe it or not males. You have lost your responsibility to your public. To make a commercial with the intent of being sexually explicit would have been considered soft pornography not to long ago and would have been corporate death. YOU ARE A FAMILY RESTAURANT. You are not selling sex. You are selling hamburgers. Who is your audience. You need to take this ad down immediately. I am offended as a mother, a woman and a parent. As a commercial on TV during times when children are watching, you are harming them with full knowledge because you think there are no consequences. HARDEE&quot;S knows full well, by the time I as a viewer switch the channel from this offensive ad, the ad is over. You take away my right to not view such filth. That makes me MAD. I know I speak for many woman who are parents and I hope they write, call, and get really ANGRY so our voices are heard by you. STOP. You, are responsible for desensitiing the public, especially our youth, to think that sex is casual, with no consequences and that anything veiwed sexually is OK to sell your product. It is just an Ad. Well, you need to hear loud and clear that it is not OK. I want it to stop. TAKE DOWN YOUR SEXUALLY EXPLICIAT AD NOW. I want an apology. 



 Sandy 2/28/12 
 If you don&apos;t print my comments or move them up the channel internally, I am going to post everywhere on the internet I can. In my entire life, I have never done anything like this. I have never been so offended by a commercial in my life. This Ad finally pushed my buttons. This is how angry I am. I am so tired of having to be exposed to corporate america not taking any responsiblity for what kind of commercials it makes to sell its products on TV. That Ad is so harmful to so many people. 



 Cindy 2/28/12 
 I was highly offended and extremely disappointed in a Hardee&apos;s as family restuarant when I saw the commercial last night for the patty melt involving the young woman in a car at the drive in. Not only was the commercial inappropriate, it was basically soft porn, it was insulting. Putting peppers on a sandwich will NOT make a woman come out of her clothes and appear to experience a totally different activity. Congratulations, you have ensured that I will remember your commericial and NOT buy your products. 



 Renee H. 2/28/12 
 I am a Christian. Even if I weren&apos;t, I wouldn&apos;t want any child to view your new commercial. I am apalled at the recent &quot;girl at the drive in&quot; commercial! It is soft porn!!! IT SHOULD NOT BE ON ANY TELEVISION CHANNEL OTHER THAN A PORNOGRAPHY ONE!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES YOUR MARKETING DEPARTMENT THINK ABOUT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER? Obviously, your company needs to rethink its marketing strategies!!! I have held my tongue long enough! Your company continues to try to sell sex, not food! I will NOT be a customer of Hardee&apos;s any longer!!! I am also sending this to as many people as I can. I am researching to see what can be done to stop this sort of pornography. What&apos;s next Hardee&apos;s? Is your next step to solicit children??? 



 G. GLISSON 2/28/12 
 I am very much offended by the new commercial you are airing for the new &quot;hot&quot; thickburger. It does not take a display of sexual connotations to sell a hamburger. You are supposed to be a family oriented eating establishment and this clearly shows your lack of respect for family values. I do hope there are many others who will express their displeasure with this vulgarity. Please remove this commercial !! 



 ashley 2/28/12 
 Okay where do I begin? I have very much enjoyed the food and service for awhile now. I recently watched your latest commercial.. first of all I cant believe in a million years that this is even aloud on television. Secondly that you would even represent your company in this light. I have seen several of your commercials but this takes the cake. I actually read tons of reviews and letters written over the YEARS and nothing has changed, only gotten worse. Clearly Hardees do not care about how the women have been feeling. They obviously do not care about the women and children. They care about targeting perverted men. I would think commercials would try to attract families. I am highly disappointed. This email is clearly pointless because people have been complaining for years. THEY DONT CARE! 



 Evelyn Brown 2/28/12 
 We enjoy eating at our Hardee&apos;s store in Troy,Mo very much. There is no complaint, I have just seen a commercial on tv and I am disturbed about it. It is a young lady sitting unlady like, and her push up bra has just about pushed THEM out. I hate the commercial, Please take it off the air. I am going to start a campaign with my friends all over the U.S to get this smut off the air. Make a cute funny commercial for once. Too much sex, this is demeaning. How far can we go as a nation before the Lord strikes us dead. We are like Sodom and Gohamorrah now..As much as I like the food, I will not patroitnize your restruants again until this is GONE.

Have your advertisers run out of cute idea&apos;s? Why not let the kids in grade school help them. I bet they could do a better job with subject matter.

Sincerely

 I work for the hardees in Easley on East main street!
I have the best Gm who works way harder then anybody else.
We love our customers&amp;have tons of regulars. We don&apos;t usually get complains but when that random complaint comes threw.. it&apos;s usually a miss understanding. It sucks that people are having such horrible experiences I guess it&apos;s just where you go. 



 Mary 2/27/12 
 This is not concerning a Hardees location, it is concerning a commercial for Hardees that aired in Virginia, Feburary 27th. I can not believe that a chain like Hardees that is supposed to be a &quot;family&quot; resturant would allow this commercial to advertise its food.
The young woman was baring all, and having what appeared to be a erotic experience while eating a Hardees sandwich.
I am not a prude, however, I feel that this is no message that should be sent to our young girls, and has no place on prime time television. It would be better suited to a porno site.
I will not be a customer of Hardees in the future. 



 Ron Stout 2/22/12 
 I ususally do not do this, but am fed up with one of your stores. The store is located at 21st&amp;Post rd., in Indianapolis IN. I stop by 5 days a week for breakfast(usually my only meal of the day). Again today, the store was not open at the posted time of 6am. This happens at least 3-4 times a month. There is no excuse for this to happen. Your company is in the food industry and you cannot profit from this store if nobody is there to open the store. I am not looking for freebees or anything like that. I just would like someone to respond to me and let me know that action is or will be taken to ensure this store will be open at the times posted. Thank You. 



 Bill&amp;Betty 2/14/12 
 Corporate - WAKE UP. You&apos;ve got a problem with consistently poor employees at this location. I&apos;ve tried for over 11 years to go here, hoping for improvement, I really like Hardees. The vocal violence throw to one another, customer rudeness coupled with apathy shows that Hardees is out to lower the bar. This place needs QUALITY ASSURANCE to take notice. Prime location staffed with atrocious employees and management. 



 Sandra 2/12/12 
 2/12/12 I was in Billings Hardee&apos;s. I was warmly and professionally greeted by Carey at the front counter. Carey did great with adjusting my order several times at my request as well as making suggestions noting my trend in choices discussing Hardee&apos;s menu.
My meal was exceptional but the atmosphere here even better. I let Carey know I can rarely eat out due to a rare medical condition and recently having to become a non-gluten advocate...reluctantly. (Like a &apos;diabetic&apos; once in a while a good burger (donut) is worth the pain)
I laughed when I read the napkin holder, &quot;If our food tasted like their&apos;s, we wouldn&apos;t bring it to the table either.&quot; Whoever came up with that slogan had to be another &apos;Carey&apos; as a part of your company. I let Carey know I would be writing your corporate office in praise of her efforts that seemed to be so natural with her quick smile.
I also wanted to commend another employee working today. Nalei was very busy and keeping the place running as a &quot;manager&quot; with questions asked.
I was in this store once over a year ago and as can happen in a business employees had not shown up and one of them working that day, to put it nicely less than historical up to Hardee&apos;s standards with goals of keeping the customers happy.
Nalei&apos;s efforts in keeping a large crowd, lunch, coordinated was so memorable when I saw her today the memory came back to the fore. That fact Hardees could keep employees with a store disaster of the last visit shows outstanding support from your company and specifically the head manager here in Billings.
Great food, great service, great atmosphere, and an all around great experience with lunch today. A great big pat on the back for Hardee&apos;s from Billings to your office.
Sandra 



 taneha riley 2/2/12 
 management need to be fired!asap Springlake, nc.The manager of this store has no respect for her employee&apos;s.Her behavior is on called for.She has the same nasty mouth to the customer.She&apos;s a non-compliance manager.I have called and spoke to some about her...please hell those employee&apos;s I hate to be them putting up with bs..
 



 Kim Williams 1/31/12 
 It is very unforunate a lot of you had such horrible experiences. I work in the Brooksville Flo location, and I must say that almost all of our employees work very hard for our customers. We have many MANY regulars and we do try our best to please everyone. However, sometimes we get SO busy. Stores are only allowed a certain number of labor hours a day. We are often understaffed. So at night, when you have one shift leader, a cook and a drive thru/front line person and then 5 different groups come in up front and order, along with several drive thru orders at one time....things get hectic QUICKLY! Someone has to help get food done in the back, and if only one person up front, they have to ring everyone up, get drive&apos;s drinks, bag orders, and take out dine in orders. Chicken fillets and tenders are prepared when you order mostly at night. Our drive thru time is 6 mins. Well, a fillet takes 5 something to cook. Not including the breading time and then time to make/wrap/bag it. So that is why people are pulled forward. Especially if someone behind you ordered something small that is ready. No excuse for workers to be rude. But I must say, there are some customers that make you BITE YOUR TONGUE. They will order a &quot;sausage biscuits&quot; and get a sausage biscuit....then say &quot;No. I wanted the gravy&quot;. !!!!!!! Then order a BISCUIT AND GRAVY!!!! They will change the name of items and get aggravated at your questions then get upset they ordered incorrectly. Also, when we say &quot;IF THE ORDER ON YOUR SCREEN IS CORRECT&quot; PLEASE look at the screen. Well I am done ranting. I do love my Hardees. I have went to other stores like Gainsville to assist with their new store and I must say no other store works together like Brooksville! We all help one another.

 Tanya 1/8/12 
 I like Hardees in Spanish Lake MO. The staff are always kind, especially the &quot;Drive-thru&quot; staff. The burgers and fries are good. I don&apos;t enjoy their &quot;Mexican&quot; enchiladas, burritos etc. but that is not their fault. I always enjoy seeing a regular gathering of senior folks who meet there to socialize. Overall, the Spanish Lake group are great people who work long hours. Don&apos;t blame the staff for the menu as they have no control over it. It is always clean and I want to compliment the staff in Spanish Lake. 



 brittani gibson 1/1/12 
 OK, where do I start? The location in Callahan FL is rediculous! Every time I go trough the drive thru I am asked to pull in to the parking lot to wait on my food. I&apos;m usually OK with doing that but it frustrates me when the parking lot is full of drive thru customers waiting on their food as well. So, on 1/1/2012 I went to the drive thru to get some breakfast with my husband and they asked us to go park. I let them know that I am always asked to park and I end up waiting for 15-20 mins to get my food and I&apos;m not OK with moving. The lady at the window got irritated with me and turned around and yelled I guess to the manager &quot;she won&apos;t move.&quot; After that happened she got our food in a timely manner and slammed the bag at me and was completely rude. This is rediculous and I think management is to blame. I have been inside this location to eat before and they have gotten &quot;quote&quot; backed up,which is complete bull crap bacause there was barely anyone there and I heard the manager tell one of her staff members to unplug the time sensor to the drive thru. I&apos;m sorry but I think they should be monitoring this better because people are being mistreated at the Callahan location and then when customers get upset the hardees staff is retaliating. Oh, and did i mention that inn the timely manner that the lady got our food the bacon on my buscuit was cold and it seemed raw! I know its not fine dinning I feel like they should care more about their customers . They need to monitor and train their staff better. Find new management! 



 E. Williams 12/23/11 
 My boyfriend works at your company. He and I both agree that your hiring managers suck balls. You need to start hiring people who deserve a job and are willing to ACTUALLY DO THERE FREAKING JOB! Your workers here in Wyoming are lazy whiners that throw fits whenever they have to do there job. &gt;:( Your managers need to be replaced as well if they are not going to do what there job entails. Everyone is utterly disgusted with you now. You better clean up your act Hardees or you are going to go down the drain.

P.S. The last inspections prove it. They scored below 65.

 TIME AND AGAIN WE GO INTO THE WEST COL SC HARDEES AND THE GUY OR LADY DOES NOT WEAR GLOVES AND LOOKS NASTY, WE HAVE REPORTED THIS SEVERAL TIMES, WE WENT ELSEWHERE TO EAT, NASTY NASTY-JUST WEAR GOLVES HE WAS MAKING SAUSAGE BISCUITS BAREHANDED AS USUAL DOES ANYONE CARE ALL THE CUSTOMERS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT 



 jean pitt 11/15/11 
 Over the weekend we purchased one of the newer burgers (with blue cheese, swiss and onion rings, etc and so forth ). Very disappointed. It&apos;s way too much to even bite into comfortably and too many flavors jumbled together. To make it even worse, the bun does NOT hold up to all that sandwich. It was a disgusting mess... Please reconsider... 



 Tracey Weems 11/16/11 
 This morning 10/16/2011, I walked in the rain to go to Hardees restaurant (GreenTree Shopping Center, Dover, DE)...not far at all, since my office is located in the same shopping center. When I arrived in the Restaurant, there was no one up front (not in drive thru or front registers). After waiting for approx. 2min, an employee walks in from outside and takes an order for drive thru. She never acknowledged me standing there, a simple &quot;one moment please someone will be right with you&quot; would have been nice! (Note: I also never saw her wash her hands after coming from outside) Shortly after this employee walked in from outside, another employee also comes in from the outside. She goes over washes her hands, chats with someone in the side office, and then proceeds to walk to the back of the restaurant...again NEVER acknowledging me standing there. I look over and the other young lady is still working drive thru&amp;there is one cook in the back (where was the Manager, who knows??). I stood there may be a total of 9min. (mind you, I only have a 15min break) before finally walking out and walking to another nearby restaurant; I figured Hardees didn&apos;t want my business...Very poor customer service on your employees part today.

 Usually when we have been to Hardees in Adel, GA the service is good. Tonight was a different story. It took almost half an hour to get my food. My seven year old granddaughter noticed how slow they were and commented that the service was poor! A couple came after I ordered my food. They ordered, got their food, were almost finished eating before I got mine. My wife&apos;s fries were cold because they were sitting on the counter for about 15 minutes while the attendant was getting the chicken wrap.

 I&apos;m a employee at Hardees from what I hear it seems many have had bad experiences. It&apos;s very unfortunate when you have a rude cashier. Sometimes its not even the cashiers fault your order took so long. Workers are understaffed at times and get a great deal of cutomers and it becomes very difficult to take on the task with low labor and high sales. I should know i work with one other person from 4p-2am. I&apos;m a drive thru cashier, and I also work as a cook when my manager is busy so i&apos;ll float back and forth to taking orders than making the food. I get many many customer comments that are great. I believer if I were to move from the store customers would leave. Many of them come there just to see me. I&apos;ve had several people come from out of state saying they&apos;ve never met another cashier like me anywhere in fast food, really makes me happy. I think I deserve a promotion after working there full time in murphysboro il. hardees from 07-08 for eleven months while i was sixteen and seventeen all of my junior year of high school. I worked as a cook in the evening during school week and midnights during weekends. During summer time i worked about 54 hours a week full time midnight. I moved to metropolis Il. in sep. of last year and began working at hardees again in March of this year. I was 20 when i started I am now 21. I would love tot be promoted I can do more than some of the people above me can do and some of them have way less experience than I. Hopefully I&apos;m promoted soon. People in the drive thru ask me if I&apos;m the manager and they get disappointed and say I ought to be a manager. I know my customers regularly and they love me and can count on me for satisfaction often leaving tip money that i cant accep. i&apos;ll put it in the drawer and somehow that drawer still manages to come up short. It baffles me. No wonder the store is coming up short money. Maybe if they had bed managers like Johnny Rock who have a great potential to be manager. I believe my manager sees it in me. Hopefully soon :)

 Today I visited the Pgh ( millville) location with my family on my way to visit my fathers grave, which when I was younger visited there quite often. As a family on the go, we spend lots of money monthly on dining out. One of my daughters had to use the barroom immediately and my other daughter was starving so when we went to use their restroom I was astonished on how deplorable the bathrooms where. They were absolutely disgusting. I triple-Plied the toilet with toilet tissue and awed as my daughter used the bathroom.. After she was finished and several washings of our hands without paper-towels we went to get our food, which I didn&apos;t really want to eat, but my finace had already done so. The food quality was poor, and the restaurant as a whole had really went down in quality( especially as the prices are not worth it ) I have NEVER expected to see this from a HARDEES!!! It was the worst experience ever.. :(
Hands down -0 rating..

 On saturday the 29th of october,2011 i ate at the Hardee&apos;s of Owosso, MI. A Red Burrito combo was purchased. My wife tasted the burrito and did not like the way it tasted and refused to eat it. so i took the combo back up to the counter to see if i could get the meal replaced with something that my wife had eaten there before and liked. When i told the lady at the counter the problem she made a rude sigh and said what do you want me to do about it. I asked if we could get something else. She said she couldn&apos;t help me but would talk to Lori the manager. They did agree to replace it with a fresco burger combo. Yet they were very reluctant to accomidate us. When the meal was brought to our table the same lady threw it on our table rolled her eye&apos;s then walked away. Today sunday the 30th of October,2011 i recived a call about a comment card that i filled out. Lori as she introduced herself as was very rude to me. Telling me that she was right there as the situation was handled. She then stated that it was handled in an approperiate manner. Being rude with a firm tone in her voice. She also stated that,&quot;you would be hard pressed to find another resturant that would let me exchange food because we didnt like the taste.&quot; I beg to differ. Applebee&apos;s of Owosso cooked 3 different stakes for me because they were not properly cooked. Culvers of Mt. Pleasant replaced a Philly steak sandwich for me because the one i had gotten was all grissel. When i fill out a comment card its to help a resturant know what the costumer wants when they are paying $7 for a combo. It is not so that another member of that same resturant can call me and be rude to me the next day. I paid $15 yesterday for rude behavior and unwanted attitude. I didn&apos;t want another $15 of attitude today as well. I have been eating at this store location for 20 years and after this incident i will never return to that store again! I will also be writing to the local papres to have them publish my complaints. I am very outraged by this lady&apos;s absurd behavior. I would greatly appreciate a call so i can further explain the situation to someone who may care as to how these people at this store think they can treat paying customers. If were all quit coming they all lose their jobs in a state that already is facing hard economic times. My phone number is (989) 331-4264 Jon Kimball

 My Family consisting of my wife and our 8 year old Daughter visited the local hardee&apos;s resturant located in wood river illnois and we used coupons for our food purchase we ordered a six dollar burger and get one free. and two 1/3 pound cheese burgers for $3.00 and we tryed the two chicken enchillada&apos;s for two dollars we then wanted to get some ice tea for a dollar a glass but was informed that that offer was no more. so we asked for 3 glasses of ice water. because we are on ssi/ssd and we dont have mutch money to go out on. we then was given number77 and went to go find a table to sit at over by the tv set&apos;s to watch while we was waiting for our food and we could&apos;nt find a clean table to sit at there was food debris all over all of the tables and paper garbage from people that was there and didnt&apos;t pick up thier messes when they had eaten thier food. we recived our food and the six dollar burger was under cooked it was raw dripping with red water coming from the frozen patty that was under cooked. we was starving and eaten the food anyway,s then we tryed to eat the chicken enchillada special&quot;. we planned on splitting the food. because of lack of money we looked at the food and the chicken enchillida&apos;s were flat with a small bump in the middle for some sort of unknown filling..they was covered with a red enchillada type sauce and more than a proper portion of cheese for a topping while the sauce was dripping from the edge of the plate where a thumb print was evident from its preparation. i then walked up to the counter and waited about 5 minuites for an employee to come up front from the back of the store so i could ask for a refund for the food the server woman said that my food was cold and it had been sitting for a while that is why it appeared like this she described to me i told her that the food did not appear like the picture advertised on the window when we came inside she said that we would have to talk to a manager to get a refund the manager came and was stern voiced and she refusingly gave us a refund for our enchillada but not for the raw food that was served while the employee looked at us and she shook her head in a back and forth manner to say no! i went back to my table and noticed a pocket between the wall and the bench that was full of garbage and half eaten food then i had looked down at the floor and had seen mouse droppings and food all around then i reached for my handy digital camera and started taking photographs of the garbage and mouse droppings and here came the mouse he posed for the photos so nicely like he was saying &quot;Here I AM&quot; like he was the new Hardee&quot;s Mascott!!. my wife said that both toilets in the woman&apos;s bath was filthy and full of urine! not flushed! I then reached for a hardee&quot;s questionare form to fill out and filled it out noting the defects of service and bad food and filthy tables and restrooms I looked at some old couple sitting in some filthy debris left over from some other people and asked them if they didn&apos;t mind if I photographed them and the filth they replied and said that it was ok and was discusted about the condition of the restuarant so I took about 35 photo&apos;s of trash and dirty tables and the new hardee&quot;S STAR THE MOUSE! I then walked back up to the manager and had told her about the garbage and filthy conditions of the restuarant and that the restuaraunt was infested with mice and I was going to report the bad condition of the store to the corparate office and I had told her that I had photographed the filth and the mice problem .&quot; well &quot; I was not welcome any more so we walked outside and had seen a mouse outside and had photoed him along with the front of the store with the employee&apos;s looking through the glass at us we then walked to our vehicle taking pictures of the trash and debris outside in the parking lot. well needless to say I called and reported the restuarant to corparate and told them about the problems. we used to like hardee&apos;s a lot but the lazy employees dont want to clean they just want to serve slop and get paid. its time to fire some people and clean up the shop! before the board of health comes in like I said I have photo&quot;s.

 me and a good friend of mine who just came back from serving a 3rd tour over seas. thought we go to hardees for breakfast on hwy 29 north of pensacola florida,to get something to eat. And when we got are food it was cold and the grave wasn&apos;t full.My hash browns were hard as a rock. the people were rude and disrespectful. i called the district manager to get this settled but nothing got settled cause a few day later i went back i got the same treatment as i got before.Oh yea by the way i don&apos;t want your free meals or coupons i just want good service. i believe you shouldn&apos;t settle stuff with coupons or free meals,i think that is a slap in someone face that your not getting to the bottom of things that your blowing your customers off. I mean good service makes good money for companies and poor service makes poor money and bankruptcy. oh yea and 9 mile rd in pensacola is no better they are just as rude as 29. Thank you for taking time to read this, i hope you can get to the bottom of things.
Sincerly,
Tammy 



 Completely Unsatisfied 10/15/11 
 Hardees...Bonifay, FL... The worst experience EVER!!!! There should definitely be an option for a zero or minus! POOR Management including talking to De Anna... the Manager..and Summer! These people should be fired. These are the people that should be taking out the trash! I would think customer satisfaction should be the no 1 priority! It is not the case here! My boyfriend had a frisco burger, large that was not hot and the bacon was not cooked!!! My burger combo did not even come with a burger...yes I mean the meat..the main part of the burger was not there. Then they brought out another burger for myself and it was horrible as well as no fries! This place is disgusting! ALL the customers had a problem!!! This is unacceptable. We asked for our money back. They gave the money back for mine, but not the other one that is already making my boyfriend sick, because of eating part of an uncooked and cold burger! Only the Assistant Manager was there, and we had to call another manager, De Anna, that was rude and not willing to give us our money back. This Hardess location should just start from scratch especially Management! 



 mason pair 10/13/11 
 I love hardees but the one in callahan,fl something odd is going on with the manager.I find it very odd that I ask the manager for a receipt and she replies I put it in the bag.well there was no receipt in the bag called the bank and I was overcharged $10.the number at the location has been busy for over an hour.kind of curious how many people she has done this too but this is the second time for me.it never happens when she is not there I&apos;m just sayin
 



 james watts 10/9/11 
 your &quot;god of hamburgers&quot; commercial created by some idiot that has no fear in the real &quot;God&quot; has probably worsened your business . I know I am offended by the commercial along with over half the people of this nation 



 Peggy Cassidy 10/7/11 
 I am not writing to complain. I have not been to a Hardees in a long time. There are no Hardees where I live. There was one about 20-25 years back in mjy town, Petoskey, Mich. I haven&apos;t seen any ibn a long time. I remember back in the late 60s early 80s there was a Burger Chef ion my town. I heard that Hardees bought up Burger Chef, was wondering if this is true. I used to eat a burger called BIG CHEF, OR BIG SHEF. Ia loved it. I wondered whether Hardees has that on their menu. I also wouldn&apos;t mind knowing what goes on the sandwich, as I am no where near a Hardees. Again, its the BIG SHEF, Do they carry it, Would love to know, thanks Peggy pjcass84@charter.net If I were to rate the BIG SHEF, as I call, it would get 5 stars, thanks 



 Dan Gatlin 10/2/11 
 Our family and most of our friends love eating at Hardee&apos;s, however lately there&apos;s been some changes that have been for the worse, like for instance removing certain items from the menu like their Crispy Curls, only to have them put back and taken off again. Then there is the Caramel Crumb Biscuits that were so delicious, but they took those off as well. They did however bring back the chili-cheese hot dog but only after a very long absence, and let us not forget about their Southern Breakfast Potatoes, which were very tasty but alas they too had been removed. I don&apos;t seem to understand the rationale behind these moronic ideas to get rid of menu items when customers like them so much. You would think they would try and keep them on their menus but such is the brain-trust behind the corporation I guess. Well if you want to keep many of your customers happy, just bring back those menu items I named off and they will be coming back in droves. 



 Doug 10/1/11 
 I&apos;ve had trouble for years with this Hardee&apos;s on Lackland and Craig Roads in Saint Louis, 63146, at their drive-in window. They hire some of the laziest and outwardly rude people you&apos;ll ever come across.
Half the time they don&apos;t get your order correct. Other times they get confrontational when you correct them about getting your order wrong.
Today I went stopped there while driving home.
I had to wait several minutes behind a truck at the window. When I finally pulled up to pay for my order, a car pulled in behind me. I was told that my order was taking too long to cook and I&apos;d have to pull up and wait because there was a customer behind me.
I said I wasn&apos;t moving, that they&apos;d have to wait like I did. When she insisted I said &quot;No&quot; and she closed the window. She then went outside to the car behind me, gave them their ice cream and took their money.
Two minutes later she gave me my order through the window, said, &quot;You have a nice day!&quot; then closed the window and said &quot;You&apos;re rude.&quot; I hauled off on her and called her every name in the book, also asking why she couldn&apos;t apologize to me for my long wait like she did the woman behind me?

What caused the problem? A Rude, aggressive black control freak female with an ignorant mouth who hates white people. That&apos;s what caused the problem. There is a McDonalds about a mile from there that hires the same types and I&apos;ve had it out with them. This is a nice area and this trash doesn&apos;t even live here. They couldn&apos;t afford it.

Yea, Hardee&apos;s. This is what your customers have to deal with.

Next time, I&apos;ll have a witness and you can expect a lawsuit. Either that, or fire that trash. 



 Byron Allen 9/27/11 
 Any one who writes an ignorant comment can go and try to work at hardees. I bet it&apos;s alot harder than you think, first of all they have to deal with nasty costumers like you. I enjoy Hardee&apos;s alot and the employees at Leadington, Mo. Hardees are very kind. The cook&apos;s make the best 1/3 pound steakhouse thickburger. 



 Mr. Watzel 9/27/11 
 Aberdeen, SD Front counter person the other night - name started with a T - was rude, wouldn&apos;t take the order, and was too busy yelling at the cook that she doesn&apos;t have to do her job, that&apos;s she&apos;s the manager&apos;s pet, and it doesn&apos;t matter what the cook says. She finally comes to take the order. She was impolite, and in a huff. 



 fred hunter 9/27/11 
 My wife and I have eaten dinner at Hardee&apos;s for many years and recently it has gone down hill to the point I will never eat at that hardee&apos;s again. Can anyone tell me how long should you have to wait for a burger and fries with one order in front of you? After 15 minutes I wanted my money back. The manager acted like I was inconveniencing them, and didn&apos;t showed a lack of concern that was shocking. NOTHING no I&apos;m sorry, no nothing, and if could prove racial intent I would and will. Truly disgusted. 



 marsha giorgianni 9/24/11 
 i live in lake city fla. add i eat at hardee&apos;s a lot but on 9/17.2011 the girl ran my debit card 3 times and i did&apos;nt find out till mt=y statement came ,,i been told that the home office will fix it but as of today nothing so be careful with you charge cards at hardee they will run it more than one time!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Debbie Shaw 8/18/11 
 I&apos;m writing this email to advise you about Makesha Wade in Kernersville N.C. on Main st. I eat their at least twice a week. She is the most unconcerned manager I&apos;ve ever meet, she&apos;s nasty in everything she does, I don&apos;t ever want her to service me again. My fries had a black long hair in them and my chicken was not done. I approached her and she acted like she didn&apos;t even care, when back to my seat and I could hear her and another employee talking about me. After that I didn&apos;t want the food. I want to request that she is replaced, she don&apos;t deserve to service the public with her nasty attitude. Or I want be eating at your establishment(EVER AGAIN). 



 jaso botkin 8/22/11

 Makesha Wade 9/1/11 
 Why is the turn over rate so high, do anybody know what it takes to run a restaurant. May be you need to start at the top with the District manager,and General Manager (Tom) and so called shift leaders, to many African American that are so ghetto. I&apos;m black but do care to see some Caucasians in the restaurant, it seems to me they are really going down, this store is so disgusting. I don&apos;t eat their anymore because of their bad reputation and I work their, every one knows about them in Kernersville N.C. 



 Jenny Jones 9/13/11 
 Your Cynthiana Ky store needs some serious attention from what i heard the manager got an employee pregnant and there is alot of drugs going on in the store. It is terrible on day shift i cannot believe this young kid is a manager the way he plays around with the employees.

 Just ordered take-out little thick burgers (2 for $5.00) and when my husband was 3/4 finished with his burger, a clear plastic pen cap fell from his burger. How grose!!!!! Called corporate office and waiting for a response. What a shame because we have been going there for years, NOT ANYMORE!!! 



 Employee 7/7/11 
 I was a formal employee at hardees in Kernersville N.C. Tom has no idea about what it takes to be a general manager, he is hiring people and don&apos;t have a place to put the one&apos;s he have. Please take in consideration to replace him. He make it his point to hire girls and always make sure he keeps them on the schedule were he can watch them in their tight jean, as he would put it.

8/7/2011 8:32:52 AM

I went to Hardees this morning and a woman over the intercom asked me if I wanted a breakfast menu special. I replied, &quot;Wait one second and No Thanks.&quot; The woman then asked through the intercom, &quot;What was that?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;No thanks to the breakfast special and wait on second.&quot; My husband and I were looking at the menu to decide what we wanted to order. Another woman (had a different voice) asked me if I wanted the same breakfast menu special and I replied again &quot;No thanks. Wait one second.&quot; This happened within the span of 1 minute and my husband was trying to tell me what he wanted to order. He preceded to tell me what he wanted and I repeated it back through the intercom.

When my husband and I drove around to the window to pay, the woman at the window repeated what we owed with a snarky smile on her face. I handed her my card and two coupons. Those coupons were the whole reason we went to the Hardees in the first place. She gave us the receipt and handed us the food.

When we got home we realized that the MEAN WOMAN did not give us a discount on the coupons and did not even have the DECENCY OF A NORMAL HUMAN BEING to give the coupons back to us at the window. Not only that but our tater tots were completely in crumbles.

I was not mad because I pity people like that woman who make minimum wage. She&apos;s most likely dissatisfied with her position in life as a drive thru attendant. She probably wishes that she had more power in life and it gives her some little satisfaction in life screwing people over by not scanning their coupons, not giving them the deals they deserve, and giving people the crumbled tater tots on the bottom of the rack. Either way, she should not be allowed to treat people badly because her life is shitty.

I called Hardees to get in touch with the manager. Instead, I got in touch with an employee telling me that the manager stepped out. An hour later I called again and let it ring until I heard the phone pick up. Followed by the phone picking up was this screeching sound which gave me the impression that someone had picked up the phone and stuck it to the microphone. I then spoke loudly into the phone and said &quot;I am going to get in touch with corporate and report my visit.&quot; All of a sudden, someone spoke on the phone and said, &quot;Hello. Is someone there?&quot; I replied, &quot;NO! I am going to get in touch with corporate. I am going to tell corporate about my visit this morning. GOODBYE.&quot;

As soon as I disconnected my phone, I took the receipt and scanned a copy of it. I also took pictures of my meal and I intend on sending these things to the corporate office. There is no way in hell I am going to eat my meal. I do not trust that the mean awful attendant did not do something to the food to affect its integrity! I do not think that people should be treated like this and I feel like this is definitely a step backwards since it is 2011. I say this because you hear about lawsuits happening all the time and people should be held to a higher standard even and especially if they are representing a franchise Fortune 500 company.

I feel it is a moral obligation to share my experience at this Hardees because this world should be a better place for every man, woman, and child who expects a quality breakfast. 



 Linda Harris 7/12/11 
 Good morning! I sure hope you take the time to read this note, as I feel it is something you should be made aware of. My husband and I stopped at the Hardes on Tazewell Pk, Knoxville Tn (117635) for a bite to eat on July 12th, 2011. This Hardees is usually packed with people and on several occassions, it is difficult to eaven find a seat. This was NOT the case today. Very few people were in there, and this in itself is unusual. We stood in line approximately 4 minutes while the girl at the register stood in the back and waited for the manager to come up and break a $50.00. This does not sound like a long period of time, but it actually is when you are at a fast food restaurant. This was NOT the fault of the girl at the register, but was the fault of the manager, who was walking around in the back, doing odd jobs here and there. Unfortunately, the line at the counter was building more and mor 



 Shawn Moore 7/13/11 
 What has happened to the Hardee&apos;s in Kernersville N.C. go their and you might get anything, Tom S. has no people sills with his employees or customers, please replace management. I appalled of the service and food. 



 Beth Milos 7/13/11 
 My husband and I ate at your Hibbing, MN store tonight (7-13-11), we ordered our food. No salad options except a side salad. Why no large salads? You have everything to make a small one why not a large one? Anyways, we take our number and look for a clean table. Not a single one in site. I could understand if it was busy, but only 2 other customers there and they were eating. So I wiped a table with a napkin. We sit and I look at the salt and pepper shaker are covered in grease. A thick coat of grease. The napkin dispenser had a thick coat of dust. An employee comes from behind the counter with what seemed to be his break meal, and sits at a dirty table. Were would your employees get the idea they can take a break when your store is a mess? I managed a restaurant for 10 years and now own my own business. If the front of your store looks like this I can&apos;t imagine what the back looks like, hence we will never, and I mean NEVER!! go back to that or anyother Hardees!!!

 jonathan 7/27/11 
 the food has always been good but have you paid attention to how often your employees are getting breaks? EVERYTIME i go into my local hardees i hear someone say they haven&apos;t had a break. isn&apos;t that illegal? to say the least it&apos;s not right. those people work hard and shouldn&apos;t be mistreated like that.

 Hermann, Mo location The only reason i rated this as 1 is because i couldn&apos;t rate it zero, The employee&apos;s are rude and careless, and is impossible to get fresh food. Wouldn&apos;t feed this food to my dogs, store is filthy Owner kevin and Kathy need to get out of town, next im going to call the health inspector. 



 Mary Snyder 6/12/11 
 My friend and I often go to get a Hardee&apos;s sausage biscuit breakfast but I am always
&quot;out of luck&quot; because, while he enjoys his coffee, I have never been to any of your restaurants where they serve hot tea!! Why ??? Surely I am not the only hot tea drinker in Va./N.Carolina and south. 



 Paul Little 6/13/11 
 I usually don&apos;t eat at hardee&quot;s because of bad experiences. But I took a chance on going their to order a tea and milkshake, went to the D/T the employee that served me had false fingernails on and they were all different colors. How unsanitary is that, I just went on and paid for the order. Stuck the straw in the drink and it was sour tea $1.80 and the milkshake was milk(VERY RUNNY) for $3.11. What is going on this hardee&apos;s in Kernersville N.C. is not concerned about good customer service or practice sanitary. Do they not know how many germs and dirty artificial nails carry. Some one should call the health department and close that restaurant down. 



 Just nasty 6/1/11 
 Me and my husband have been eating at hardee&apos;s in Kernersville N.C. on main street for 3yrs. We walked into the restaurant and it was so nasty I started to just walk out, but I said to my husband maybe their having BAD morning. Were standing their waiting for about 10 min for someone to take or order, someone finally came, the manager (Makesha Wade) to take our order, (she came in from smoking) she said can I take your order and I said yes as soon as you wash your hands,(she didn&apos;t LIKE that to well). She came back and we place our order, sit down to eat and their is dried up eggs and cheese under my food on the tray, so I took it back to her (Makesha Wade)and asked her for a refund. Her attitude is just as bad as her service. Need to be retrained in customer service and food handing. Ill never eat their again not until they change their managers, they use to have go one&apos;s &quot;what happen&quot;

 I was in your restaurant in Kernersville N.C. When two girls came in to attack one of your employees (Felicia). With my two children and my husband, and they came in with a blade and I&apos;m standing their and while this was going on my children were crying and screaming my husband took them out and the police came. They told us that one of the girls was a DISTRICT MANAGER in Walkertown and they had their kids in the car while they attacked this girl. My daughter is still having nightmares from time to time. I was trying to forget about this my self until my brother told me about the poster they have in the restaurant of Miss Turkey Burger. This not a family restaurant. They may as well turn it into a night club. 



 Ray O&apos;Neil 6/6/11 
 On Sunday June 5,2011 around 2pm I went to Hardee&apos;s in Wildwood FL. on main street for lunch. My first order was all wrong. The second time they forgot my frenchfries. On the third time they got it right. When I placed my first order the young girl was talking on the phone but did hang up to take my order. The
manager, at least the one I think was, was talking to other employees. Other customers had to ask for the tea machine and ketchup to be filled. This is not the first ant this Hardee&apos;s but it was the worst. 



 Sandy Davidson 6/6/11 
 I am writing in regards to the Happy Star Rewards program. This program absolutely sucks. My byfriend and I both applied the app to our I Phones and because we pass one daily we decided to give it a shot. Most days it will not allow you to access for check-in, in order to get your spins and then on the days it finally allows you to (after the 4th check in) it should allow you to spin however, always there is a server error and then it will register your check-in but takes your spin. This has become so frustrating for my boyfriend he says since you now have so many check ins that they don&apos;t want you to spin and will any good prizes...I say even when I am standing in the middle of the restrurant it tells me I have to be in a restrurant to cheeck in. I have become so feed up with Hardees that I called the corporate office spoke to the custmer service area and was to a member from senior management would be getting back with me. That was 5 days ago.....of course no call from anyone at Hardees. I guess they know their game sucks and are not willing to do anything about it to fix. We are not the ony two having problems with the game however, I am tired of no one speaking up against companies they claim they have a contest and then no one can ever win anything. I was told a one location that the employees were the only one usng this app. Imagine that ...... 



 Marla 5/25/11 
 Let me start by saying I don&apos;t usually eat at Hardees but Monday May 23,2011 I stopped at the Hardees in Lightfoot, Va. (Williamsburg) on Rt. 60 and was very pleasantly surprised. We met two of the nicest and most pleasant associates I have encountered in a fast food restaurant. Irisha and Calvin could not have been more helpful or efficient, my mom and I are light eaters, they prepared burgers that were perfect in size and taste. I could tell they enjoyed their work and their customers. The next time you are in Lightfoot/Williamsburg, be sure to stop by and see Irisha and Calvin, you&apos;ll be glad you did! 



 D. Conrad 5/26/11 
 Went to local Hardee&apos;s in Richmond, Va and ordered two shakes. When I received them they both were half a cup. I asked the cashier about that and she said they don&apos;t fill them up. At $2.99 this appears to a rip-off. Maybe they should stop filling the cups up with whipped cream to hide the fact that you are only getting half a cup. Anywhere else you get a full shake up the the rim. Spoke to the manager but she didn&apos;t seem to care.

 SherrieL. W. 5/14/11 
 Every time I vist Hardee&apos;s , located in Jefferson City, Tn., I can already know that
my order will NOT BE CORRECT!! It is NEVER correct.. and I believe will NEVER be correct no matter what. On said date of 5/14/2011 at 10:39am, I once again, visited this Hardees in Jefferson City, Tn. I made it very clear, without using any foreign linguistics , ebonics, in PLAIN english that I wish to order a Sausage Biscuit, add Cheese with Extra Butter. I once again, confirmed with the cashier that took my money, and she stated, &quot;Oh yes!&quot; It is definitley correct. I am so tired of these cashiers blantantly lying to me and probably the many other customers. I went home,, and like usual,, my order was so mixed up.. but this is NOT something NEW.. my Sausage Biscuit had a tomato, no cheese, and was covered with
Mayonnaise! Why oh why Managers do you let this continue.. because one DISSATISFIED customer will certainly tell others and others will tell others!! I am so appalled how this store can continue to stay open.!! 



 Teresa 5/18/11 
 I use to eat at Hardee&apos;s but no longer do because of the commercials. They do not have to advertise women hardly dressed. There is enough of this on TV, I don&apos;t want to walk in Hardees with my family with Miss Turkey full figured in the corner.I would put 0 rating for Hardee&apos;s but that was&apos;nt a choice. 



 Sheila Dummer 5/19/11 
 I always eat breakfast in the mornings, so I choose hardee&apos;s in Kernersville N.C. BIG MISTAKE, I just should have drove on to Winston Salem. I proceeded to the D/T to order, it was 5:45 and the lights were on but know one was answering me on the speaker. So tried to go in and the doors were locked. So a Spanish lady finally see me. And the manager finally opens the door, I smelled nothing but those funny cigarette(drugs).I didn&apos;t place the order,I didn&apos;t want anything from their. I think I saw her name tag it was Tanya M, talk about being responsible. I&apos;ll never stop their again. If this is the kind of place you run please replace your employees the can open at the right time, and don&apos;t be getting high before work. Just concerned 



 Jane 5/11/11 
 MT STERLING KY HAS THE MOST RUDE MANAGER EVER MICHELLE I BELIEVE WAS HER NAME. OVER HEARD HER YELLING AT HER EMPLOYEES VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! ALSO WAITED OVER 10 MINS FOR OUR FOOD! 



 Brenda Giles 5/11/11 
 Question???
Why do all your commericals always have to throw the food down? That is disgusting!!
You are suppose to make food look good. I think you should get someone else to do your commericals!!
And now they are shooting them out of something!! That is unreal!! It keeps getting worst. Everyone talks about it being the worst thing ever!! Hardees already have a problem getting people in for evening meals. Breakfast is Great!! After seeing the commericals I wouldn&apos;t want to eat dinner there!! PLEASE change it.I want tot tur nthe channel everytime one comes on!!
Breakfast is a FIVE STAR!!
After all you don&apos;t throw that down!!
Thanks,

 I am not writing to express dissatisfaction with the Hardees restaurant itself, but the offensive and tacky advertising campaign recently launched on tv. First it was &quot;Miss Turkey&quot;, whose attire leaves little to the imagination, and has men (and even young boys) staring with their mouths open. Of course this has little to do with the burger advertised. That was tacky enough, but today I saw the most recent ad, with the man lifting weights while the dominatrix is cracking the whip behind him as he lifts. This type of advertising is absolutely inappropriate.

Our family has always been a big fan of our local Hardees restaurant...the food is great, the management is stellar. Two of our children had jobs there in the past. However, this new advertising spin has made me re-think spending my hard-earned cash at a place that is supposedly family oriented but chooses to run this sort of campaign. You wont earn any &apos;gold stars&apos; from your customers for this, thats for sure. 



 Benjamin Hines 5/10/11 
 I was about to order at the northside Hardees of Dothan, Al. when I saw a short black lady named Debra turn to get food from the shelf but stopped to scratch her head.It was then that i asked her to wash her hand before fixing my food, and her reply was then,I do this every day.So I asked did she scratch her head and prepare people&apos;s food and she sarcastedly said no fix y&apos;alls food.I am very upset that a person of her posisition could carry on in this manner.I don&apos;t know what your standards are when it comes to becoming a manager, but there are to many ways to become ill than having to deal with the flesh and head germs of another person.She needs to be demoted damn your sales! 



 A concerned citizen 4/28/11 
 You are employing a man by the name of Timothy Wade Risner, 32, at your Hardee&apos;s location in Savannah, Tennessee. This person works the breakfast shift. Before his employment there he was incarcerated for almost two years. From stealing, shoplifting, multiple D.U.I&apos;s, fraud...probably more...his record will speak for itself. Since his employment there since the fall of 2010, he has stolen from the facility on a daily basis, from breakfast food to utensils....and more. He regularly puts food and supplies in the dumpster when he takes out the trash...and picks them up at another time. Recently he has been taking home the restaurant keys and having them copied. He was arrested most recently of january this year for yet another D.U.I. and disappeared from work for over 2 weeks...he was rehired even though he presents himself at work often in an impaired state..from alcohol to narcotics of all kinds. Most recently he was burned at your retaurant with hot water on his arm and wrist...due to his drug impairment. He stated that he signed a paper releasing them of responsibility..and saying that he would not go to a doctor for this injury. He see&apos;s multiple doctors as a method of drug seeking...and is on probation at present in McNairy County, Tennessee, for his latest offense. He has purchased cocaine from a truck driver by the name of James, who delivers to HARDEE&apos;S in Savannah on Friday mornings. Mr. Risner also sells a drug called soma at work...that he obtains by calling a 1-800 number, Medical Technology or EZ-scripts...and somehow purchases this legend medicine hundreds at a time. He also posseses a government food stamp card...which he recently sold to a recent manager there at Hardee&apos;s called Crystal. He has violted his probabtion time after time in McNairy County, Tennessee. He also has an active criminal record in Florence, alabama...his cases are under Judge Carole Medley and Circuit court Judge Mike Jones. He may have active warrants. He has no respect for his employer fro spitting into a complaining customers food to theft. Is this the kind of employee you want? 



 New but unsatisfied Employee 5/2/11 
 I refuse to give away my identity due to the fact that I don&apos;t want to lose my job. The Hardee&apos;s of Emporia , VA is where I&apos;m employeed and though I&apos;m glad I do have issues there. I was never thouroughly trained so i still don&apos;t know the extras of the menu like everyone else. I work one day a week because my manager says I have poor performance (yet I&apos;m never put on the schedule). The kitchen area is nasty the floors are filled with grease and water and I almost managed to fall at one point. All the other employees with the exception of one are rude obnoxiciuos and are shown favoritism. And somehow my last paycheck got messed up considering i worked more than 6 hrs and 37 min

 NANCY COMPTON 4/12/11 
 NOT ONLY DID HARDEES ASK ME TO PULL FORWARD AND WAIT BECAUSE THEY HAD THE PERSON BEHIND ME ORDER WAS READY AND MINE WASN&apos;T. I REFUSE TO PULL FORWARD AT ANY FAST FOOD RESTERAUNT.WHEN MY ORDER CAME TOOK THE BAG AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS NOT COMPLETE. I HAD LEFT HARDEES AND PULLED IN THE NEXT BUSINESS PARKING LOT AND CHECKED MY ORDER AND IT WAS NOT COMPLETE. I WENT BACK TO HARDEES AND THE WOMAN HANDED ME THE REST OF MY ORDER WITHOUT MY ASKING AND WITHOUT AN APOLOGY. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME HARDEES HAS MESSED UP MY ORDER BUT IT IS THE LAST TIME. I WILL NOT GO BACK TO HARDEES IN BUTNER NC AGAIN. I REALLY THINK THE MESSED UP ORDER WAS DELIBERATE...................

 Hi, In this day of recycling and conservation for the future, when does Hardee&apos;s plan to be more green? My husband goes to have coffee just about four times a week with fellow citizens from Milaca, MN He loves the coffee. Now, this is the problem, in the past he has been able to use his own ceramic coffee cup which was just great. You know, the one with the Hardee&apos;s logo on it... Great advertisment.. Was that the plan when this was suggested. Now apparently he is forced to be served coffee in a foam cup of which he is bringing home at least five or six of these a week, what happened? I don&apos;t want these foam cups laying in the landfill for 1000 years do you? I am sure you do not want this to be the legacy that yet another fast food chain has left the world come on Break out of the mold let the fine people who frequent Hardee&apos;s be glad they are making the world a greener place to enjoy their lives and their children&apos;s lives the future is at hand take a risk do the right thing right? ok thanks for your time 



 4/19/11 
 the hardees in foutian inn, sc the manager talks down to his employees, new employees havent been taking their computer courses like they should have done from the begining, its takeing a month or so to even start their computer courses, shift leaders are being asked to take the courses for the new employees, i had to call out once for something i had no control over and i was taken compleatly off the the schedule for a week and when i call to see if i was going be back on the schedule they didnt answer or told me to call again.....the manager is rude and constantly calling me out of my name......please do something about this 

 

 Sheila S. 4/19/11 
 I was really shocked when I walked into my local Hardees and saw a 7 ft. figure of a girl in a binini at the front of the store. Thankfully, I did not have my children with me. I was so offended! I spoke with the store manager and the district manager. They do not agree with the offensive cardboard figure. You barely notices what&apos;s in here hand due to the bare body? What a negative message they are sending to women and children. Needless to say I did not purchase anything and will not until they change their marketing techniques. It seems that after what I&apos;ve read lately about their advertising they have very offensive and explicit advertising in the past. I went to the Subway down the street and was happy. Choices are nice! I&apos;ll help spread the word about this to my friends and family. 



 rrose snow 4/20/11 
 My husband and I went to hardees in NOrmal Il Wed April 20 at 800 am. we waited 15 min to get waited on. then another 40 minutes for our food people came in 15 minutes after us and got the same food we ordered I asked about why and all i got from employee was they ordered first I told hime no they didnt he argued with me and the manager just stood there sayin nothing finally he says they ran out of biscuits and gravy I told hime I wanted my money back and told hime I would never be back the manager or employee neither spoligized. This is a very unmanaged hardees the employee says he didnt care we were upset. My daughter worked there for 15 years and was assistant manager and was never run how it is now. word of mouth hurts busines so good luck 



 Mary Alyce Donohue 4/20/11 
 First let me state that we enjoy Hardee&apos;s weekly. My husband is retired and has breakfast at Hardee&apos;s most mornings. The staff at the 86th Street Hardee&apos;s in Indianpolis is exceptional and the food is always goo.

However, last Sunday morning we had our grandson and two grandaughters with us when we went to Hardee&apos;s for breakfast. Right at the front of the counter area was a large, life-size cutout of a bikini glad young women wearing a sash stating she was &quot;Miss Turkey Burger&quot;. I feel this bikini girl cutout is very inappropriate, degrading to women, and in very poor taste. I was extremely surprised that Hardee&apos;s used this cutout in their restaurants where families come to dine. What exactly does a scantily covered girl in a bikini have to do with burgers? I spoke with the manager and filled out comment cards.

We will not eat at a Hardee&apos;s while this cutout is their restaurants. Come on Hardee&apos;s, I thought you had higher standars! 



 Andrea Garrett @dragonlay800@yahoo.com 4/20/11 
 2 times now my husband went to get us breakfast at our local hardee&apos;s in oskaloosa, iowa. I was so upset at what i found that i almost threw up. both times now my breakfast crossient&apos;s have had BLACK MOLD on them. one of the shift leaders tried to tell my husband that it was the machine making them black. When you look at it and see little tiny black hairs on it that is mold growing. I called up to our local hardees an i yelled at the shift leader her name is patty and i let her know how i felt. I also told her that the customer service is non existent the employes need to smile and actuly care bout there job. in my opanion coporate needs to get rid of all the current empoyees and hire new ones ppl that actually care about good customer sevice. i hope this issue gets resolved and soon. 



 Wonda White 4/5/11 
 Monday March 28, 2011, I went threw the D/T and paid or a 10 piece chicken tender. On the way home I gave my 3 year old one to eat, not knowing the chicken was raw. That same night my son was severely sick, had to take him to the hospital. Next day I talked to Tom the general manager he was not concerned with the situation at all said their was nothing he could do. what kind of food service is that. They are not responsible for anything if you get hurt or food poisoning. I will never eat their again (Kernersville N.C.) 



 Thomas Sailors 4/5/11 
 Hardees location is on Old Hickory Blvd in Hermitage, Tennessee. I WAS a regular at this location. Won&apos;t be now. Time was 3 PM April 5. In the drive through I couldn&apos;t understand the Spanish speaking order taker and he evidently couldn&apos;t understand me. He got my order wrong. I decided to live with it. After I had paid they ask me to pull off to the side and wait while they took care of those in line behind me. I could have lived with that but I had an infant in the auto and could wait no longer. I pulled around the restaurant to the window and ask the manager for a refund. She had the audacity to ask me to pull to the side and park once again to wait for my refund. I refused. I drove around to the doors and had a friend watch my child while I went in to get the refund. The manager gave me the wrong amount back. I had to ask again and she finally gave me a refund. The problem with this manager is that she had an attitude, a dung eating grin on her face and actually blamed me for her giving me the wrong change. If you want to continue to do business in MY neighborhood, get your act together. 



 SB 4/5/11 
 I was in the drive through and waited for almost ten minutes and i didnt check my order to until i was almost to work when I called there to talk to the manager the person on the phone said they were the manager but once i started to express my concern she put someone else on the phone and at that point i was beyond mad because first off i waited for my order then to get it wrong and the the fries was like they had been sitting there forever..and then to act like your the manager only to put the real manager on the phone just was poor taste..so i went back two days later and when i rode pass everyone was in the lobby including the manager so i preceded on to the drive through where i waited and i timed them to see how long it would take them with me being the ONLY car waiting and no one came on to ask for my order and it was 8:10pm to be exact so i just left..so its safe to say that i wont be visiting there no longer 



 benji brock 4/5/11 
 our family went to hardee&apos;s in honea path s.c.for breakfast monday april 4th.the gm,brenda clark was yelling at all her employee&apos;s and rude to her customers.we over heard her putting her employee&apos;s down.yelling at them to go faster and they was doing their best.her employee&apos;s had done nothing wrong.she needs to be replaced. 



 Bruce Phillips 4/6/11 
 On April 5, 2011 I visited a Hardees located at Salem St. in Lexington,NC. My breakfast meal came to $2.24. The manger was the person who was waiting on me. I gave her $20.29. I gave her four pennies so I would get a nickel back. She said to me &quot; I&apos;ll will have to give you back the four pennies&quot;. I said no, you will give me a nickel. She said I was wrong. I disagreed with her but she insisted she was correct. I took the four pennies back because I knew this women had a very limited education and it would be a waste of time trying to explain this to her. I would like to ask Hardees, HOW&apos;S IT WORKING FOR YOU, HIRING MORANS TO RUN YOUR RESTAURANTS??? 



 George D, Athey 4/3/11 
 I have lived here in Dandridge TN now for 3 years, going to the Hardee&apos;s in Dandridge and in Newport. The problem I have is your suggestive selling practices!!! They are a distraction and a nuisance to the customers at the drive through. I had a very disappointing visit today at store #1501808 in Dandridge, April 3, 2011. I knew what I wanted when the voice on the speaker asked to try the new Turkey Burger, that was okay because this was what I wanted, but before I could get out that I did not want onions or pickles on it, she is blurting out back do you want cheese, then I tried the onion/pickle thing again and once again she blurts out do you want to make it a meal.I said SSSTOP!!!!! Now listen to my order and get it straight. 1 turkey burger, no onions or pickles with cheese. And she immediately rang up 2 burgers instead of one so I told her I only want one. Then when I went to the pay window, I told them about it and she came over to the window, I told her to let the customer place the order first then do your suggestive selling, most of the time the time-wasting questions you have scripted to them are covered in the original order.The proof of her ringing up 2 is positive proof, it is a distraction to them as well, &quot;She said&quot; &quot;I heard you order two&quot; how did she get that was my next question and she just said again, &quot;I heard two&quot; and we have a script they give us and we have to follow it, and walked away from the window. Then another gentleman gave me my order very rudely and practically threw it at me. I probably use this Hardee&apos;s restaurant 3-4 times a week (1501808)but this incident is trying my patience to continue using any Hardee&apos;s much less this one. And come on now 35 cents for one piece of cheese to boot on top of all that, a little gougy don&apos;t you think 



 4/3/11 
 The one in Warrior , Alabama should get a ZERO . That^s right a ZERO !! They don^t even try to get it right and are rude doing it .

 Hardee&apos;s in Wilmington,NC are the BEST!! We need two Hardee&apos;s be open 24 hours one by UNCW and one by New Hanover Reg.Med.Center both the lobby&amp;drive thur 24 hours !! Be great if all your Hardee&apos;s have WIFI !! Thanks !!


 



 Nicky in SC 3/29/11 
 My husband and I went yesterday to eat at the Hardees in Beaufort - we ordered 2 turkey burgers, the most awful sandwiches we ever ate anywhere ! Please take them OUT of the menu ! The bread was insipid, the meat was... yuck ! you know...this kind of leftover meat that they grind fine and reconstitue as a loaf ? I brought back a piece to my cat...guess what...he smelled it and walked away without eating it...if that can tell you how bad it is !
I bet that&apos;s not the sandwich they eat at the Corporate desks ! Please Headquarters, learn about SPICES !!!! and use real meat ! 



 Barb 3/30/11 
 my daughter and i went to hardee&apos;s this morning in Garner, Iowa and to say the least, we were disappointed. When i pay 5 bucks for a sandwich combo, i expect there to be meat on the sandwich, the stuff this location is passing off as sandwiches is a joke. there was absolutely no meat on my loaded omelet biscuit, it was all egg. If i wanted an egg on a biscuit i would have stayed home and fixed an egg and cheese sandwich. My daughter was also disappointed with her meal. She got a breakast Frisco that had sausage in it, and she ordered a ham one. the people in the kitchen at this location need to go back into training and learn which meats are what, and need to actually put SUBSTANCE in their sandwiches. 



 Diane Thompson 4/1/11 
 I drive a school bus and most resturants give the bus driver&apos;s their food when we take a group of students in. Well, on March 24th,2011 I tool a group into your Hardee&apos;s and when asked about whether the bus driver was taken care of by the resturant they told me yes and then I was charged fro my food and the also told me that they had never heard of any resturant that gave the bus driver their. I told them McDonald&apos;s does and that I would never take another group into your resturant again especially the one in Shelbyville,Tn. I was given an apple pie after me paying $6.34 for my meal. I would like to know if this is something that you would consider chaning or is it something that will stay this way. You can respond back to meat the folling address: Diane Thompson

 David Parker 4/1/11 
 I stopped in at the Hardee&apos;s on Stafford Drive in Princeton, WV on March 27 2011 and ordered $11.00 of food and paid with my debit card. The $11.00 meal then cost me $33.00 because their card reader is malfunctioning and it is not Hardee&apos;s fault that it is the banks fault. After calling the actual store, the store manager states that the District Manager is aware of it and stated that the District Manager said it is the banks fault. If the bank has sent out three payments for one transaction to the store it is the store&apos;s responsibility to make it right you collected the money, not the bank. My bank has nothing to do with your card reader or your mistake. 



 fed up customer 4/1/11 
 no matter where i go the food is always sloppily prepared, theres hardly any meat on the sandwiches, and the employees always act like it is a burden to serve you. What happened to the days when Hardees actually gave a crap about their customers and strived to be the best fast food chain in the USA?? If i could i would give Hardees in general a negative star.

 



 Barbara Haney 3/26/11 
 I would give a negative star if it was an option. On 3/36/2011 I went to the Hardees on Hartman Lane in OFallon, IL at 12:00. I had to repeat my order several times. I had to wait for my order for over 10 minutes in the drivethrough. Then the order was wrong. When I went back inside to get my order corrected, I had to wait 5 minutes, despite the fact that there was only one customer at the counter. The store was EXTREMELY dirty, with the counter so dirty that I could not touch it without getting what I assume was a mixture of condiments. The grime throughout was awful. When a counter person finally emerged, I asked to see the manager, the counter person argued with me. Then another person (tattooed with gang marks on his neck)told me I had to calm down and wait my turn. After 15 minutes, I finally got a manager. She then did not understand my a six dollar burger with no catchup. She took the burger back and started to scrape the catchsup off the burger rather than give me a different burger. The manager clearly was either high or clueless, I&apos;m not sure which. I decided that I did not want to trust the store, the personel, or its cleanliness. You got my money for the burger, but I did not get a burger. In the future, I&apos;ll go to White Castle or MacDonalds. I would like my six dollars back and compensation for the hour of hell spent on your store, but I won&apos;t ever eat there again.

 Hardee&apos;s in Kernersville N.C. manager Makesha Wade came to the front of the store and employees ask her were she was a she said she was in the office(her and the employee joked just sitting down)remaind you I have been waiting for someone to wait on me for about 15 min. And they are joking. I place my order she did it all wrong. I asked for my money back a she acked like she had a attitued with me, and very disrepecful to me. Were are all the good employee&apos;s now days Please do something with this employee. I really wouldn&apos;t want to ever run into her again, that&apos;s if I ever go back into your establishment again

 Ive worked at hardee&apos;s in Kernersville for about 6 years, was taken off the schedual because I didn&apos;t agree to the way he was talking to me (Tom). Just came off vacation were drinking was his main purpose, which he should have been relaxed. I never had a general manager like Tom Steward, this current &quot;manager&quot; and I use that word lightly, has no clue about inventory control/management/or customer relations. He discriminates, only hire women he thinks he can get in their pants, and exemployees from wendys. He really has corporate fooled. Your &quot;district manager&quot; needs to look into this matter immediately, this GM Tom Steward needs to be directed in proper protocal, and if she cannot handle that, maybe she is not management material. I was suppose to have a meeting on monday March 21 2011, but when I talked to the district manager she was aready taking his side. Im not even going to waste my time, Ill be OK, just keep working my other job and going to school, they will find out later about him but I hope it&apos;s not to late.

 I visited the Saluda, Virginia Hardee&apos;s on Saturday, 03/05/2011 around 2 p.m. The restaurant had approximately 6 people sitting at tables and no one at the counter. I stood at the counter 3-4 minutes before anyone waited on me. While I was waiting there were 2 women in the back (kitchen section) screaming at each other. Approximately 10 minutes later I got my 2 milkshakes with milkshake dripping down the outside of the containers. Never again.... 



 Audra Ireson 2/27/11 
 Me, my cousin, and our fiances went to a Hardees in Kingsport, TN, we ordered $25.00 worth of food to go on a trip. When we looked in our bag there was no silver wear and all our food was cold, it was the worst service I have ever had in my life, and we eat there all the time. We then called in that same day and explained to the manager what the deal was, she then stated that she would replace everything that we had the next morning. I then woke up and drove up to Hardees expecting to recieve good service, but when I talked to the manager she stated that no one had called in that she did not take a call for that order, I stated that yes she did cause I was the one who called. She then proceeded to tell me that she could not replace the order. So I drove all the way up there and wasted gas that I did not have to get lied to. I think that, that Hardees needs to fire every manager that works mornings on saturday and sunday, and hire people that can actually do their job! I will not ever eat at that Hardees ever again, and I will make sure that everyone that I know that eats there all the time knows how bad I got treated and how bad the service was. That Hardees does not deserve any buisness they get, and they don&apos;t even deserve to get rated 1 star for there buisness! 



 Steve White 2/28/11 
 I always stop at Hardees on the days when I work to get my breakfast. Recently I&apos;ve noticed that the Minute Maid Orange Juice I get with my sausage and egg biscuit has had a rancid taste to it as if Minute Maid has been using spoiled oranges in their mix. I really like Hardees food with the exception of the orange juice which I have stopped buying. I have had to actually throw out no less than 3 boxes of OJ as they were undrinkable. I recommend you contact Minute Maid, and ask them about this. I intend to. Keep up the good work! Thanks. Steve White, Richmond, Va. 



 Ed 2/21/11 
 The only good comment for Any Hardees in Springfield il is that rarely is my order wrong. That being said the service is always extremely slow. This is worse on the night shift. I would eat there more if I were confident I wouldn&apos;t be sitting in the drive thru for 15min. I mean it&apos;s supposed to FAST food. 



 Jack Tilton 2/12/11 
 Your Texas toast hamburger commercial is pitiful. No self respecting Texan would be caught dead in a ugly pair of boots and the nastiest looking hat I&apos;ve seen. Hardee&apos;s is a joke for that. 



 Lynn 2/14/11 
 The &quot;manager&quot; in the Hardees restaurant in Andalusia Alabama is only having the employees working one day a week and 2 hours in one day. Can she justify that with gas going up.? She is very rude and has no concern for her employees. 



 Ashleigh sims 2/17/11 
 Ok so I&apos;ve been trying to get my husbands w 2 since January 19th... I&apos;ve made calls I&apos;ve tried everything I want his w 2 immediately before I&apos;m for forced to take a more aggressive action. He&apos;s deployed currently and I have power of attorney so this shouldn&apos;t be too hard. I need a reply immediately I find this extremely inappropriate and unprofessional. 8709179251 



 Danielle Marshall 2/19/11 
 Rivercity Hardees in Jacksonville fl has the most unprofessional, immature general manager that I have ever witnessed! And I would really love to report her! Could anyone give me how to go about this?

 Izzy Best 2/5/11 
 I phoned the local Knightdale NC Hardees to report concerns re our breakfast order.
We ordered 3 sausage/gravy biscuits and 6 plain biscuits.
The plain biscuits had butter in them and there were only 5 and all the biscuits were
crusty hard and required good teeth even when soaked in gravy.
When I reported this to the Manager-on-duty she said in you don&apos;t want butter you
must order &quot;PLAIN&apos;(which we always do).
I asked her what word we use to get UNHARD biscuits and she couldn&apos;t tell me.
I was only trying to make Hardees aware and explained that many people would just
never go back but her defensive response makes me one of them!
WHAT HAPPENED TO HARDEES? 



 B Clark 2/7/11 
 I stopped at the Nevada Missouri Hardee&apos;s and went thru the drive thru - I ordered the 3 piece chicken strips. I did not open the sack up until I arrived home 25 miles from there. The chicken was not eatable. Burnt and hard, was very upset. I do not believe this is what you want to supply your customers. Hope it will let somone one think about what they are putting out before they put something like this again. Really upset!!!

 Awful place to eat and work!!! 37188 Whitehouse TN
They treat customers and employees like crap. 



 Paige H. 1/29/11 
 today i went to hardees and went through drive thru and the employee ignored me the whole time until i had to ask and ask if she was there, i finally raised my voice saying &quot;HELLO???&quot; she then came on very rudely and didnt even finish my order and she told me to leave. never got any food and was a horrible experience. i will never go to hardees again. 



 LYNN NEEDS TO LEARN GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! 1/26/11 
 The Hardee&apos;s in Franklin, Georgia service sucks. LYNN needs to learn to keep her mouth shut and show respect to the customer&apos;s and the employee&apos;s. LYNN needs to learn GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! When you go through the drive-thru your food should not be all over the inside of the bag when you go to open the bag. Hardee&apos;s hires nothing but rude employees...manager&apos;s or not, they&apos;re rude,if you don&apos;t know what &quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; is, then please don&apos;t apply @ any jobs..who do you think pays &quot;your checks?&quot;...the customer&apos;s..that&apos;s how businesses makes their money,but most of them who are rude whether inside or @ the drive-thru, majority of the employee&apos;s that works for Hardee&apos;s are soooooooooooooo rude...then you complain about not having a job?..then you get a job, and you don&apos;t even know what &quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; is..so before Hardee&apos;s plan on &quot;Hiring&quot; anyone, please, please send them through school of &quot;HOW TO GIVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot;...and remember &quot;GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; PERTAINS TO ALL JOBS! 



 Gregorio P. 1/26/11 
 First let me say that I like your food........However ...I have a problem with the Manager, Dawn L., at the Godfrey Il. store...She and her &quot;CLICK&quot; employee&apos;s I feel have gone to far....a 3 year DEDICATED employee, who will be there, when ever called is being laughed at behind her back and being kept out of things because she are NOT part of the &quot;CLICK&quot;...for EXAMPLE...your promotion for the Green Hornet movie a New Uniform was issued for the Crews....she Didn&apos;t get one....then The Manager asked her where her uniform was a week later and not in the most pleasing tone....a 3 year employee gets treated like this....WOW....Example, When a regular customer GIVES a Gift Cert. at Christmas for the Crew, and she was off that day, but the Crew was told by the Manager (Dawn) to &quot;keep this on the down-low&quot; about this to her....There IS a BiG Problem Here....I Have Voiced My opinion about this store and This Manager and her Click before (about a yr ago) and STILL There, and Nothing will be done, and I can say this because The Manager is STILL THERE.....but like Everyone knows....CORPORATE is Only about the Benjamin&quot;s and could care less about How They Get The Benjamin&apos;s....as long as THEY make $$$























 



 kim smith 1/27/11 
 callie at the hardees in florala alabama we wereon our way home from the san destin area and stop in hardees the place was packed there were only three people working and a bus pulled in it was about 9:00pm and only three women were working she was great with the teens and they loved her her crew worked really hard and they never stoppped until they were complete good service hard workers hands washed the cook helped her get orders out but washed her hands when another order came in one thing she did stop taking orders but only until she got the hot food out and then right back at it good job store was clean and as we were leaving all three ladies came out and attacked the lobby to clean it up !! wow 



 Angela Chheda 1/14/11 
 My boyfriend was on his lunch break and decided to stop by the hardees in South Carolina before going back into work. He orderd at thick burger and half way through the burger he noticed there was plastic in the burger. It was the type of plastic used in wrapping silver ware. He had to go back to work and wasn&apos;t able to go and complain. This is unacceptible! 



 DRM 12/15/10 
 I have avoided drive up windows due a bad experience 12 yrs ago. So, this time I went inside Hardee&apos;s&amp;placed an order to go because I was driving 360 miles to a funeral viewing. I began eating my food&amp;wouldn&apos;t you know it, the 2 apple pies i had ordered&amp;which was on the receipt, weren&apos;t in the bag. These pies would have satisfied my hunger. I had travelled 40 miles already&amp;wasn&apos;t about to turn around on the interstate to get my incomplete order. That would have added an additional 80 miles to my trip&amp;I didn&apos;t want to be late for the funeral viewing. I told myself I would deal with it on my return trip home the next day . I confronted the mgr.&amp;with receipt in hand told him about incomplete order. I asked him do the employees ever check the orders before giving them to their coustomers&amp;he replied &quot; they are supposed to but sometimes they do&amp;sometimes they don&apos;t&quot; in a I don&apos;t care type of attitude. I eat at this Hardees once a week spending no less than $5.00 each visit. Now they will lose $260.00 a year from this one customer. The store #2681 located in Chilhowie, Va. located off Exit 35 on I81. The person who took my order was Amanda. The mgr. had no name tag but wore glasses&amp;had black hair&amp;had a &quot;I don&apos;t care attitude&quot; I told him I would fill out a customer comment card&amp;mail it in rather than put it in a box on the premises where the mgr. could take it out&amp;rip it up so he would not have a negative remarks. Then I noticed there was no adddress on reverse side of card. So, I looked it up on internet&amp;will be mailing it; probably to no avail! A very dissatisfied customer. 



 Kay Monteforte 12/7/10 
 The Hardees in High Springs, FL has the worst customer service. I am tired of teenagers calling me honey and sweetie. They are so busy saying would you like to make that a combo and does that complete your order after everything I say. They switch people during your order and then you have too start all over! Your lucky if you can remember your order because of all their quest.ions! I just wanted to get out of there I will drive farther and go to McDonalds. 



 Patricia Dudley 12/6/10 
 I&apos;m disappointed yet again. I visited the downtown St Louis (Chestnut)location as I have many times before. I have experienced some aspects of poor service such as slow service, rude behavior however my concern is regarding the last couple of visits. I ordered chicken soft tacos both times. They have not been good, the lettuce is very wet and soggy, it wilted and brown, the meat had gissle in it and I paid .50 for a tablespoon of sour cream. RIDICULES!!! 

 

 never again 11/26/10 
 I go to Hardee every morning for breakfast and they are getting worst but this morning was the last time when they sold me burnt food the bread was so hard it was I could brake a window. When I call about it I was put on hold and when the manager returned I was told she was very busy call back. I decided that since they are so busy I can save the 5.00+ I spend every day and go else where.For your records the receipt info is: Dual-Hardee&apos;s/Red Burrito 1501119 St. Louis 27 (314) 869-6950 Saint Louis MO. register 1 order is tendered 11/26/2010 8:04:44 am drive thru # 2030. I rated it a 1 star for poor but it really need a 0. An apology could have kept me comming back but because of the manager poor response as I stated never again.......I&apos;ll learn to eat Jack in the box right next door to it. 



 Marcia Dudley 11/13/10 
 Today my husband and I went to Hardee&apos;s in Yadkinville, NC, the only one in Yadkinville, NC, and I have to say this is the worst service we have had thus far! It is a shame! The girl at the counter was not listening to anything we said, I&apos;m glad I am not a picky person, and I&apos;m glad that I said &quot;I&apos;ll have a #2 meal&quot;. My husband ordered next and she was not listening closely to him because he ordered just a Texas Steakhouse Bacon Cheeseburger with just mayo, a Hot Ham and Cheese, just the sandwich, and a Large Drink. Then my husband pays for our meal with a $100 dollar bill, and the girl acted like she did not want to take it, she had to get change. The manager in the meantime was saying &quot;What&apos;s this, What&apos;s this?&quot; He was talking about our order I later find out. Well, we get our food and my order was correct, but my husbands order was all wrong. The Texas Toast Bacon Cheeseburger came with just mayo, and that was all, no bacon, and to top it off, it was on a regular bun, and he never even mentioned a change for the regular bun! So, I was going to take it back up there, he said no he would just eat it. He was not happy! So, I filled out a card at the Hardee&apos;s location, but you know no one will ever see it. I in turn advised them on the card that I will be contacting the main office. This is the 3rd time we have went to Hardee&apos;s in a month or so, we don&apos;t have one where we live, and it will be my last time for Hardee&apos;s, period! If we all quit going to them and giving them business, then maybe they will straighten up! I will be contacting the Corporate Office, I hope everyone will that has a complaint! 



 Dyan Raines 11/11/10 
 We went to the Hardees at 1015 N Brindlee Mountain Pkwy, Arab AL 35016. It was awful, the floors were nasty, the restrooms were nasty, and their ratings were low. I asked why they had such a low rating and she said they never got checked, needless to say, we will not go there again. The person who worked the front, looked liked she just got out of bed, drunk, hair was like she had been in a fight and lost. 



 HOLLIS HOBBS 11/8/10 
 I can&apos;t believe a hamburger store will keep the doors open and try selling hamburgers when they don&apos;t have LETTUCE in the house.
I drove to Hardees on Pine Forrest and Wilde Lake Blvd in Pensacola, Fl. ordered 2 six dollar thick burgers when I drove thru the drive-thru and paid while I was waiting for order The NIGHT MGR came to window and announced they did not have any lettuce.
They should close the doors. You can&apos;t sell Hamburgers without lettuce.
After all almost every thing you sell after breakfast requires lettuce.
There is a PUBLICS AND FOOD WORLD with in one half mile.
I know they sell lettuce

 11-30-2010 I went to the hardees in mcdouongh ga on jedco rd for breakfast an i had to wait 30 mins for my food the male biscuit maker didnt have any biscuit maked an the general manager lisa was talking down to her enployees an throwing cups an raggs a cross the front line an rubbing all over some black male enployee.

 Dawn Kaduce 10/10/10 
 My husband and I stopped at the Hardees in Garner, IA for 2 sandwiches and a order of onion rings. The employees there are beyond ridiculous. While we were there, the employees were either standing around doing nothing or talking about their personal lives. The two gentlemen in front of us ordered sandwiches and curly fries. There was one order of fries already to go and a few laying in the tray. The employee then took some fries out of the one order to put in with the probably cold ones in the tray to make another order, just so he wouldn&apos;t have to make fresh ones. After he saw that my husband had seen what he had done, he started a fresh batch. So while their sandwiches sat there already done, they now had to wait for the fries. It took 15 minutes to get our small order, and besides the gentlemen in front of us, there was only one other couple there eating. Guess we&apos;ll just have to stick with McDonalds. 



 Paula Fry 4/19/10 
 My husband and I and about 7 of our friends from church went to Hardees of Mt. Juliet in Mt. juliet, Tn on Sunday night April 11,2010. They are at 11061 Lebanon Rd. We go to Hardees a lot but this was the worst service we have ever gotten. Every person in the building (25-30 people)who came in after us got served before my husband and I ever got ours. We went up there at least 3 times to ask about ours and thats when they finally said they never had a number 77 (our number.) It was over an hour before they finally got our food to us. All our friends were through with theirs and all the other people that came in behind us. When I went to ask for our money back they met me coming out with my order. Both my husband and I said something about a compensation or something for our wait and all we got was (I&apos;m sorry) We filled out a comment card and so did our friends but we have heard nothing. I would like to hear something back from Hardees (if you got the comment cards)Thanks, Paula Fry 716 Silver Springs Dr Mt.Juliet,Tn 615-754-8647 



 Carolyn Harper 5/4/10 
 The Hardees in Sheridan, Arkansas (72150) is ran horribly during the night shift! The night shift manager is a younger woman (in her 20&apos;s) and all of the workers must be in high school... they are all very rude, the food always taste old, and the few times that we dined in, we have to listen to the girls (including main manager) talk about all of their drama (some of which is x-rated and shouldnt be spoken of in a public place) im so disapointed in the way that it is being ran, and im seriously considering taking my business to the mcdonalds or burger king right down the road if its night shift. I hope somthing will be done soon. 



 Angela Quick 5/22/10 
 I gave Hardees 1 star because I couldn&apos;t give them a zero. I was in the Middletown, DE drive thru where I had to repeat my order three times and then had to pull over to the side and wait for my order. When an employee brought my order out to me it was wrong. I requested my money back and had to go inside. I put my order on a gift card and asked that it be refunded. As I was headed out the door one of the bubbled headed workers said have a blessed day (hee, hee) This person didn&apos;t mean it but was just making a wise crack. I turned around and said you too. My first reaction to her have a blessed day remark was to tell her to have a kiss my ass day but since she was a child whose parents didn&apos;t teach her proper manners I just left and went to McDonalds. I will never patronized Hardess again. 5/22/2010 



 Gale Kaufmann 5/24/10 
 I agree with Angela Quick, it would be a zero if possible. My daughter moved to Poplarville Mississippi a few years ago. Prior to moving she was a shift manager at a video store and also at Wendy&apos;s. She was so excited to get a finally find work and it was at Hardee&apos;s. The managers treated her horrible, they wouldn&apos;t help to train her. They accused her of stealing money, she asked that registers be not open to everyone and they didn&apos;t agree, which tells me they were partly responsible for money missing. Very convenient to accuse a new employee. The worst part of the entire situation, besides her feeling horrible about how customers were treated, how she was treated.. is that after 3 weeks she had to quit and THEY HAVE NEVER PAID HER. THEY TOLD HER THE CHECK WAS LOST... THEN THAT IT WAS POLICY TO HAVE HER WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 21 DAYS... Since then the managers have been replaced and she feels so has no recourse in ever collecting money that is due to her. 



 Adrienne Tuchman 6/1/10 
 I live in Charleston, SC, and there is a Hardees on Ashley River Road. Please do something about the sloppy food and the service. I hate to be handed something, and it is the opposite of what I ordered. The Hardees on Spring Street is wonderful. Except they need to listen closley to orders throught that speaker. There is a 90% difference in the way food is served and handed to you. I wish there was a Taco Belle there instead.









Thanks 



 Disgruntled Employee 9/8/10 
 I work at a Hardees in Billings Montana, and have been there since early June 2010. Tonight, or rather, this morning, as I right this, it is September the 8th of 2010, and even though it&apos;s only been a few months I have a huge list of complaints, and it only keeps getting bigger.

It is hard to find a job within my town, and normally I am very grateful for having a job, and will take the small amount of drama that happens in any work place with a grain of salt and move on with my day/life. But this place is unbelievable and overwhelmingly stressing.

I have been told by a few of my co-workers we are the third best store in the nation, but my question is simple: At the price of what? The way they treat their employees?

I do not wish to give away my identity, nor my store location for fear of back lash for what I have to say. On several occasions, I have been yelled at, and treated poorly over things that are really not worth the mess. I&apos;ve worked as best as I can, and do what I must, and am told to do, and that&apos;s fine with me. I&apos;d rather work hard then sit around like a dope. The favoritism, however, annoys me because certain people can get away with sneaking outside to play with their phones, or do little to nothing while on the clock. I have been accused of pocketing money when my till comes up a few dollars short, yelled at by a psycho manager when I asked where a cleaning product was, have been yelled at for trying to take a quick bathroom break, been called lazy by managers and co-workers, have watched my managers text and make phone calls on their cellphones not related to the business in the middle of a rush, hell I got yelled at on my first day there BEFORE I even clocked in. Third best store in the nation? Think again, learn to treat your employees right, and dont yell at them over the little things and treat everyone equally. Several people have quit for mistreatment, and they wonder why they left mid shift or never showed up. I&apos;m close to it myself. 



 Roger Schumm 9/19/10 
 I was at your store in Bloominton IL it had been raining and there was a pot hole on your drive that was covered up by water and hit it with my car went inside to talk to manager she told me she was trying to get it fixed for weeks now with no responce they should have put a orange cone infont of it to warn people about the hole I just want to no who is going to pay for the front end of my car and the tooth I chiped when we hit the pot hole please get back asap

 Pissed off employee 9/12/10 
 I work at a Hardees in St.Charles Mo. I&apos;m fed up with all of the problems there. I work with my boyfriend and they give him 10 and 12 hour shifts and no breaks, I normally dont get any breaks and I do everything I&apos;m asked off and then some, My boyfriend can not work those shifts like that because his knees collapse out from under him because he has bad knees and our manager knows this and doesnt care. I work past the time I&apos;m supposed to be off all of the time and the one time i wanted to actually be off on time and go home i got yelled at by both of my managers. I never complain to them about anything. Not to mention they also make there employees come into work even if they are sick and vomiting...my boyfriend was throwing up about an half an hour ago and they are either going to make him go in or make me work and i have a ton of homework and they know this (but if any other employee has homework to do they get to go home really early)...that is not somewhere I would ever want to eat if i knew that people were sick and handling my food...I have had enough of it. I&apos;m getting out of there as soon as I have another job lined up and i will not be going back even to eat there. Your not supposed to bring your problems to work and no one there listens to that rule even tho they say it to everyone. The manager is always pissed off at everyone because of problems outside of work and there is even one girl who just loves to create problems (she got beaten up on Hardees property for threatening to beat up the other girl the next time she saw her and now brings it up everyday) this same girl is a crew trainer and has no right to be because she stands around and does nothing but complain about how she wants to go home. Then calls in because she wants to go out and get drunk but when someone is really sick no they arent allowed to call out...They need to get new management in this Hardees because it is just way to stressful to work there let alone eat there. Not to mention we had a manager come in from another store (my manager is going on vacation this week so they were just letting him get the feel of our store) and he took apart all of our soda machines only to find mold all over the soda nozzles and in the trays for the excess soda that gets spilled. There are also Brown Recluse spiders running around the entire outside of the store and they get in i have killed at least 4 of them already and I have swept up two black beetles in two days time already. This Hardees needs some major fixing up because no one should have to work in that kind of environment as well as eat in that kind of environment. 



 Mark Cole 9/3/10 
 My complaint is for 3601 Country Club Drive, Jefferson City, MO 65109-1070 I go there on a regular basis 3 or 4 times a week and for the last 2 weeks the coffee has been really bad like the employees don&apos;t clean the pots and when I told the Lady Manager on duty and all she did was make another pot of coffee but I looked inside the metal pot and it was black like it was never cleaned then the Manager sat outside smoking a cigarette and talking on her cell phone is this the kind of people you hire to run your restaurants, I would like someone to check this out and get back to me before I contact the Health Dept. harleytrike2005@yahoo.com.
Thanks
 



 Pastor Darrell Toliver 9/4/10 
 I am sorry to do this (especially since my first job was at hardees) but I have notice the lack of good product in McCormick SC. I pastor a church in McCormick and occasionally I would stop for either myself or my family for a meal. Even on this morning I stop for breakfast and received the worst chicken biscuit I ever bought. Now I could have lived with this but the two Cinnamon biscuits with a quarter sized icing was ridiculous. I spent too much money to receive food like this. what happen to the good ole days when we took care of the customer? I remember them because I did it for you. I am sorry to have written this. You were my favorite fast food restaurant. Oh well, is my expected reply though. Pastor Toliver

 no matter which hardee&apos;s my friends and i go to, hardee&apos;s hires nothing but rude employees...manager&apos;s or not, they&apos;re rude..and most of them are blacks..if you don&apos;t know what &quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; is, then please don&apos;t apply @ any jobs..who do you think pays &quot;your checks?&quot;...the customer&apos;s..that&apos;s how businesses makes their money..and it&apos;s not about the skin color..but most of them who are rude whether inside or @ the drive-thru, majority of the black employee&apos;s that works for Hardee&apos;s are soooooooooooooo rude...then you complain about not having a job?..then you get a job, and you don&apos;t even know what &quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; is..so before Hardee&apos;s plan on &quot;Hiring&quot; anyone, please, please send them through school of &quot;HOW TO GIVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot;...and remember &quot;GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; PERTAINS TO ALL JOBS!

 I would like commends Hardee&apos;s on one of their most excellent employees( Robb Edwards at the Westport store #1501283).I was St.Louis, Mo.this weekend traveling with 4 grandchildren.When we stopped in the Restaurant to eat the atmosphere was very relaxing the food was great and the service was the best.After our meal Robb made us feel welcome and gave me great directions to and from the Wal-Mart store.He also gave me simple and easy directions to Grant&apos;s Farm. Traveling with four grandchild can be little much but with his help it was much easier.Dinner and Breakfast at Hardee&apos;s great. Hats off to Hardee&apos;s and Robb Edwards. June 18th&amp;19th.

 Me and my family visited a Hardee&apos;s in Cynthiana Ky on august 18 2010 and the language that i heard the youn man that looked like a student and to my disbelief was the manager he not only had a filthy mouth but he also was treating his help like crap. there were two girls working the front counter that were washing trays and they got a customers fook together and DIDN&apos;t wash their hands how grose.the two girls belly&apos;s were hanging out under the short employee shirts.

 Hardee&apos;s 1501103 Date:8/29/2010 Time:7:17:04 DriveThru #2078 Location:Brownsburg, Tn. Order: 1 Big Hot Ham CH, 1 Lrg Bev Bar, 1 Lrg Fry The Problem: the sandwich was pressed down to less than the height of their ham sandwich during breakfast time, the Bev. was ridiculously sweet, and the Lrg Fry was semi-cold and served in a small fry box (no joke, I ordered the same items from a Hardee&apos;s at home and the difference was too big to be a mistake). The clincher: all three workers(regretably white) came to the window to see the &quot;poor black customer&quot; get the shaft!!

 Hardee&apos;s on 1stSouth in Great Falls Montana deserves 0 for their service last evening. Last night, the Drive-Thru could not get the order right. Upon being told we ordered a milk shake, the girl at the window, instead of getting the milk shake, argued that we never ordered one. It took her 15 minutes to correct the order and hand us the milk shake. My dad had already given her a $20 bill for an order that was to cost $7 and some change and she handed him back some change only. My dad told her he needed change for a $20. She argued with him again that he did not give her a $20, that he gave her $11. Now, why would he give her $11 for an order that cost @$7 ???? She refused to give him change. He asked for a manager. A young kid came to the window and argued with him too. He was obviously not a manager. My dad handed the food back and said he was not leaving without his $20 or at least the correct change. The employees finally looked in the cash drawer and realizing their mistake, gave him the correct change and their food. We were 15 minutes late for the concert, and upon opening their bags of food, were missing the cole slaw and the dressing for the chicken! We will never eat there again, and we are spreading the word to all our friends and family who have often frequented Hardee&apos;s. My parents are elderly (which has nothing to do with this, but may explain why they were treated so poorly) and are very upset with the disrepectful service they received, which they should be. Is Hardee&apos;s aware of the type of employee&apos;s they hired to work at this location? 



 Lonnie Eve 7/29/10 
 Very bad service at your 1st Ave N. location in Great Falls, Mt. Very rude employess (only two on duty at 7:00 P.M.!?) We were on our way to an outdoor concert at 7:30 across the street and ended up being 15 minutes late because of the argumentative staff (2) and rude behavior of your 2 employees. We won&apos;t be back there. Nor will any of our many friends and relatives who meet there regularly for coffe and breakfast! This is too bad as Hardee&apos;s has always been a great fast food restaraunt. Not now! 



 Alex Hampson 7/30/10 
 I went to the Hardee&apos;s in El Paso, IL. The whole 45 minutes I was there, I had to watch the general manger rub up sexually on an another employee. I found this gross to see and I had my child and wife there. I did not want my son to see this and we left without finishing our food.
Cathy needs to be fired, And SHE is the general manger. She should not be behaving like this and I never want to go back to Hardee&apos;s again and i will be reporting her to corporate. 



 Sharlyn LePage 8/11/10 
 I just went to our local Hardee&apos;s in Jefferson City, Missouri, located on Country Club Dr. There were two cars ahead of me in the drive thru and I waited in excess of 10 min. It was ridiculous!!! They should consider doing what McDonald&apos;s does...if you have an order that is holding up the line, ask them to move forward. I won&apos;t be going back there for a while, that&apos;s for sure. 



 CONCERNED MOTHER 8/17/10 
 My son was working at hardees in mount vernon ky--He was let go because the manager was picking him up and taking him to work sometimes and also he helped her move, ect. She is still the boss yet he lost his job??? I know there is a clause that workers and managers arent to be together after hours (which in my opinion should be illegal since what one does on their own time should be there business and right) but if he was let go so should she have been. She is still picking up another young man and spending alot of time with him now. very bad business practices.

 On my way home 8/6/10 Im stopped at Hardees on FT. Campbell Blvd Clarksville, TN, Store #1501782, at least that what the manager on duty (Brittany) provided me with. After seeing your commercial for some time on your hand breaded tenders, I decided to give them a try. Upon entring the establishment, there were several team members working to including the manager (Brittany). One customer was waiting at the counter and one customer was in front of me waiting to order. Several minites passed with several team member passing the front counter without speaking or even acknowledgling we were waiting for service. Finally someone came to the counter and waited on the customer in front of me. Several more minutes passed and no one took my order. The customer waiting on his food was upset and said he had been waiting for his food for a prelonged period and was rinning out of time. The team on duty preformance was poor at best and serving customer was not their priority. At this point I decided to leave without purchasing any food and told the manager in departing that the service was poor and they really should try and do better. I am a business person with a business and these team members could not work for me or be a employee of our company. I&apos;m sure if this type od service or performance continues Hardees will be no more. Horrible service and employee waiting to get paid, but doing nothing for the company, at least this shift on duty when I arrived. 



 Tammy Walker 6/27/10 
 I&apos;ve attended Hardees more than once. All times I think it will be better-not! The location is on Broadway and Meramac. Do not go if so check everything down to the last item. 



 jason estes jhestes@charter.net 6/29/10 
 i have been a loyal customer but i will never go back until something is done about your male employe that wares thick blue eye shadow makeup and served me food at the drive-through window at your savannah tennessee location . when i complained to management they were very hateful and was not willing to hear my complaint . is this common practice to have men who wear eye shadow serve food , it caused me to loose my appetite and the treatment that i received from management was totally wrong . will you please address this problem, if no changes are made me and a whole lot of other people in savannah will not be back and thats a promise! 



 Bill Spence 6/29/10 
 I have been going to Hardee&apos;s for years. I went to Hardee&apos;s for lunch at the Jefferson and Walnut in Springfield IL. I met my wife there and she has a 30 min lunch. We both ordered the new chicken fingers. We sat there for over 20 min. and the customers all arounds us were served and they came in after us. We went up to get our money back and then they had our order ready like we had time to eat. I told they to give me my money back and that this is why all the Hardee&apos;s are closeing down because the service is so bad. That this is not what a fast service food is. I am very unhappy and you should look in to how your stores are run before you alll are looking for a new job. 



 Long Time Ago 7/9/10 
 Hardees at one time was pretty decent. From the 70&apos;s thru the 80&apos;s Hardees was run very well. What happened? Now all I see are abandoned closed up stores and what is opened is run in old run down buildings. Hardee&apos;s once was good but starting in the early 90&apos;s everything went down hill and has never returned to its glory days. 



 Joseph S. Waskom jwaskom@juno.com 7/20/10 
 I am a regular at the Hardees Restaurant located at 8200 S. Meridian St. Indianapolis 46217. I get good quality food, and courteous attention from each employee, all who
know me based upon my regular visits.

My complaint is that frequently, and I mean frequently, not rarely, the store is always
&quot;out&quot; of something. ie. knives, drink lids, icecream, pickles, straws, and just about any
item you can list. It is not usually a food item, but the other basics.

This happens so often, that I usually kid the employees like &quot;what are you out of today&quot;

Today, July 20, 2010, they were out of: Medium drink lids, knives, dill pickles,
chocolate for shakes.

For years here, the manager was working regularly, worked the counter, drive thru, etc.
and never ran out of anything.

This current &quot;Manager&quot; and I use that title lightly, apparently has no clue about inventory control/management/customer relations.

There is absolutely no reason to be running out of normal service items that are used
on a continual basis by the customers.

Most of the employees think she is a poor manager, and also see no reason to be out of
these regular items. Any manager may occasionaly make a misjudgement on inventory but the frequency at this location is totally unreasonable.

Your &quot;district managers&quot; need to look into this matter immediately. This manager needs to be directed in proper protocal, and if she cannot handle that, maybe she is not
management material.

I would appreciate your looking into this matter, not only for me and the other
customers, but for the benefit of the employees that try to do a good job and still
have to put up with the incomptence of their manager.

Should you desire, I would be glad to speak to one of your local representatives
about this matter. You may contact me via e-mail jwaskom@juno.com and make arrangements for a telephone call/personal meeting.

Thank you for your concern about this matter.

My star rating of &quot;5&quot; is for the food, when available, and not for the management.

 Just FYI.....WE have been a McDonald&apos;s family Forever.... We have been going to the Hardee&apos;s in Winston Salem on 1ST street now and rarely visit our old favorite place and Hardee&apos;s was slowly coming to be 1st choice.... but again today and it has happened several times now we get all the way home and had ordered a five piece chicken selects and ordered ranch to go with it and there was none in the bag!! And my child is very upset!!! We have been up there and told they were out of sauce just because they didn&apos;t want to get it and then they gave us some(this was the manager) !!! We have been up there and been harrassed for asking for extra sauce and gladly and willing will pay for it and they continue to give us a hard time and now the last 2 visits we drive all the way home and have ordered chicken selects and no sauce at all and its on our reciept. You need to get your managers and employee&apos;s straight up at the Hardee&apos;s on 1st street in Winston Salem NC ... you&apos;ll have the best food yall have had in a long time.. They got one more time and I won&apos;t spend another dime there ever!!! My family and I spend 23.00 to 25.00 when we eat there and one week we ate there 3 times!! You do the math cause if and when it happens again you won&apos;t get another penny!!The 5 stars is for the food! ch_ebron@yahoo.com

 The Hardee&apos;s at 7th and Chestnut street is horrible. Last night I went in around 8:10(they are open till 9) and was told the Red Burrito side of the menu was closed. When I asked why, I was told they ran out of stuff. I then asked &quot;what stuff, maybe I could order something you have and was told no they ran out of everything on the Red Burrito side. I then ordered Chicken Fingers and was told they were out of that too!
I ordered a Hot Ham and Cheese and I wanted a milk shake. I was told they ran out of ice cream, no shakes! So when I got my cup and went to get my tea, you guessed it, no tea, they said they ran out.

I think someone is wanting to close earlier and shutting down anything they will have to clean at 9:00.

Either your open or your not. And if your open, then serve the food you advertise!

Sounds like a good place to open a resturant!
