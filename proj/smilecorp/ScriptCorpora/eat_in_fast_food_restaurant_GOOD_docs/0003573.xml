 Summary : I have eaten at Iceberg a few times and while the food is pretty good, the price and level of service are usually not very good. If you are going to spend $8 or so on dinner (which you can expect to spend at Iceberg), you are probably better off just going somewhere else. If you are just stopping in for a shake for dessert, Iceberg is a pretty good option.
 Full Review 
 Product Selection  
 Iceberg does have a decent selection to choose from. They have hamburgers, fish, fries, chicken, hot dogs, corn dogs, etc. They are famous for their thick shakes, which are pretty good and come in about any flavor imaginable.
 Product Quality  
 The food is so greasy, even by today&apos;s fast food standards. Anybody who eats at Iceberg consistently is probably destined to end up bed-ridden and on the six o&apos;clock news for their morbid obesity. That being said, it tastes pretty good.
 Service  
 This was one of the worst fast food experiences my wife and I have had in a while. First of all, she ordered a hot dog with just ketchup (she hates mustard) and they put mustard on it. She asked them to make her a new one - the cashier told her that he would do so, but when she got the hot dog, they had scraped the mustard off and there were still spots of mustard everywhere. She took it back up and demanded that they make her a new one, which they did, but very slowly because they appeared to be bothered by her. Now, if you&apos;re looking for a hot dog, please don&apos;t make this mistake - drive down to Provo and check out J-Dawgs.
 Price  
 The prices aren&apos;t too bad considering the quantity of food that you get, but it is still pretty expensive. You will end up spending about $8 for a normal meal, but it will easily feed two, so it is a good idea to split it. Guys, I can&apos;t stress enough that if you are trying to impress a date, this is not going to cut it - if you can spend some money, check out Bambara Restaurant in downtown Salt Lake. If you just want something casual and only slightly more expensive than fast food, check out Red Robin.
 Problem Resolution  
 Awful resolution - scraping the mustard off the hot dog instead of making a new one as she had requested. Then, when confronted about this, acting annoyed when she requested a new one (which, by the way, he didn&apos;t even have to make - he just had to tell the cook, who appeared to burn his hand every two minutes, to do it).
 Value  
 Iceberg does not provide enough value to deserve our hard-earned money. There are plenty of places that focus more on customer service in a comparable price range. This should be a win-win for everyone - we don&apos;t have to eat mediocre food and get bad customer service and the comatose cashier doesn&apos;t have to do any work.
