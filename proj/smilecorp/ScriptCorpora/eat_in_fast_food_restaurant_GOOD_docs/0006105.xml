Can a man go to prison for nonpayment of child support, is it a felony?
 i am just wondering because I think whats the point in sending him to prison? that stops all the persons income and theres no way then to collect.
Its as dumb as debters prison. It makes collection of the debt impossible
so then what happens to the child and his family? they just have to go on without the money. what happens to their standard of living

 em ma that is scary because it seems to assum the parent can get a big paying job which is a pretty big assumption in todays world with millions loosing high paying job.
and that would seem to criminalize parents that are just unlucky

 The point in sending him to prison would be so he is not out enjoying his life knowing that he has a child out there that he is refusing to care for and he is just being a deadbeat.
If he is in prison for NON payment, obviously he wasn&apos;t paying to begin with. Not only that, but if he were taking care of his responsibilities, he wouldn&apos;t be on child support in the first place. It should be a felony, that way it can be a lesson to the many other men out there to wear condoms so they don&apos;t create children they don&apos;t want to support.

 Because, the idea of a prison term is a deterrent for people to not cheat and refuse to pay.

 you sould be so ashamed that you would pay child support that jail would be more like sanctuary than a sentence. what the hell if a real man&quot;helps&quot;make a child than he should be man enough to be responsible to answer yes they can and yes they should sorry bastards

 I don&apos;t know the class of the crime (felony or what), but prison DOES have lots of dead-beat parents behind bars.

It&apos;s usually a parent who refused to pay anyway so no support has stopped b/c it never began. Thus prison is time to think about keeping priorities straight like paying support&amp;keeping one&apos;s freedom.

In cases of garnished wages, some support paying parents will either work&quot;under the table&quot;(not declaring any income) or they keep a part-time job in low pay to avoid the big bucks they&apos;d earn in their university degreed profession. That&apos;s call being deliberately under employed. Both are illegal.

Child support where I live starts as low as 25% of a minimum wage job&amp;upwards with number of children&amp;education level of parent. This is to urge them to get into field of training that will most benefit the children.

Again, jail is usually reserved for those who have not been paying or are under paying. In jail they lose their part-time job&amp;will want to make up time going for the medical research job that they were trained for&amp;will make more money in. 
Source(s):
 EDIT to being under-employed. SOLE reason must be that parent does not WANT to pay. This an EXCUSABLE example. You&apos;re trained to do technical work in NASA for $100, 000 a year. Job is 850 miles from your child. But you decline job b/c that means work hours&amp;travel won&apos;t allow you to be available for all of your scheduled visitations. Parenting IS more important than money. In your town, there are only 5 jobs. 4 at fast-food restaurant for minimum wage&amp;one at the coal mines for 5x&apos;s the pay, but you are really allergic to coal dust. Staying healthy for your child IS more imortant than the extra pay. So that leaves a $100,000 trained parent making minimum wage&amp;it&apos;s still acceptable b/c child was put 1st in decision process, NOT avoiding support payments.
