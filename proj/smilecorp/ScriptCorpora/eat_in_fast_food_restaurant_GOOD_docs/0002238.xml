Nickelodeon&apos;s hugely popular cartoon series SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS--which was created by former marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg--chronicles the wacky adventures of an overly enthusiastic sea sponge and his oceanic pals in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom. Living in a pineapple home with his meowing, catlike pet snail, Gary, the fry-cook sponge (inimitably voiced by Tom Kenny) happily flips Krabby Patties at a fast food restaurant owned by the moneygrubbing Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown)--that is, when he&apos;s not engaging in nautical nonsense with his dimwitted starfish friend, Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke), or annoying his tentacled and perennially grouchy neighbor and coworker, Squidward (Rodger Bumpass). SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS employs a vibrantly colorful animation style that shows the distinct influence of REN&amp;STIMPY. It has become a veritable pop-culture phenomenon that appeals to children and adults alike with its wholesome yet slyly subversive brand of goofy humor (as well as an impossibly catchy theme song). This collection features 20 episodes from the series&apos; fourth season.

It&apos;s OK, but other seasons are better
 
 
 
My 2 year old is crazy for SpongeBob. I have season 1, 2 and 3 at home. I got the season 4 volume 1 and season 5 volume 1, but the episodes are not as good as the previous seasons. My daughter still loves it, and it might not make any difference to her.

My 9yr old son could not have been happier to receive this dvd. He really enjoyed watching it and it was wonderful to see and hear him laugh so much. He is very anxious to order season 5. We love ordering from Overstock. The bargains are great and the service is the best.
