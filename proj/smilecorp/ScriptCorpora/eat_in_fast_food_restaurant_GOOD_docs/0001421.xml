This guy walks into a quiet bar. He is carrying three ducks. One in
each hand and one under his left arm. He places them on the bar. He
has a few drinks and chats with the Bartender. The Bartender is
experienced and has learned not to ask people about the animals that
they bring into the bar, so he doesn&apos;t mention the ducks. They chat for
about 30 minutes before the guy with the ducks has to go to the
restroom.The ducks are left on the bar. The Bartender is left alone
with the ducks. There is an awkward silence. The Bartender decides to
try to make some conversation.&quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot;He says to the first
duck.&quot;Huey&quot;said the first duck.&quot;How&apos;s your day been, Huey?&quot;&quot;Great.
Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day.&quot;&quot;Oh.
That&apos;s nice.&quot;, says the Bartender. Then he says to the second duck&quot;Hi.
And what&apos;s your name?&quot;&quot;Dewey&quot;came the answer.&quot;So how&apos;s your day been,

Dewey?&quot;.&quot;Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles
all day. If I had the chance to have another day I would do the same
again&quot;. So the Bartender turns to the third duck and says&quot;So, you must
be Louie&quot;.&quot;No&quot;, growls the third duck,&quot;My name is Puddles. And don&apos;t
ask about my fucking day&quot;.

Why did the chicken cross the road?


FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more
chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?

RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. Let me make this
perfectly clear, the chicken DID NOT cross the road!

JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross the road? I mean, why doesn&apos;t
anyone ever think to ask,&quot;What the heck was this chicken doing walking
around all over the place anyway?&quot;

FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed
the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will

not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents,
and balance your checkbook.

OLIVER STONE: The question is not&quot;Why did the chicken cross the road?&quot;
Rather, it is&quot;Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we
overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?&quot;

DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally
selected in such a way that they are now genetically dispositioned to
cross roads.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The
chicken&quot;crossed&quot;the black man in order to trample him and keep him
down.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR: I envision a world where all chickens will be
free to cross the roads without having their motives called into
question.

GRANDPA: In my day, we didn&apos;t ask why the chicken crossed the road.
Someone told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was good

enough for us.

MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares
why? The crossing of the road justifies whatever motive there was.

TYSON: I dunno, but that ear sure tasted like CHICKEN!

EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath

the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road, it transcended
it.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die. In the rain.

COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one?

Yesterday

 
 

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There&apos;s not half the files there used to be,
And there&apos;s a milestone hanging over me
The system crashed so suddenly.

I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data&apos;s gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

Eleanor Rigby
Sits at the keyboard
And waits for a line on the screen
Lives in a dream
Waits for a signal
Finding some code
That will make the machine do some more.
What is it for?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Guru MacKenzie
Typing the lines of a program that no one will run;
Isn&apos;t it fun?
Look at him working,
Munching some chips as he waits for the code to compile;
It takes a while...
All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Eleanor Rigby
Crashes the system and loses 6 hours of work;
Feels like a jerk.
Guru MacKenzie
Wiping the crumbs off the keys as he types in the code;
Nothing will load.
All the lonely users, where do they all come from?

Write in C (&quot;Let it Be&quot;)

 

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
&quot;Write in C.&quot;

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
&quot;Write in C.&quot;

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO&apos;s dead and buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.

If you&apos;ve just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC&apos;s not the answer.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C

Something in the way it fails,
Defies the algorithm&apos;s logic!
Something in the way it coredumps...

I&apos;ll fix this problem somehow
Somewhere in the memory I know,
A pointer&apos;s got to be corrupted.
Stepping in the debugger will show me...

I don&apos;t want to leave it now
I&apos;m too close to leave it now
You&apos;re asking me can this code go?
I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t know...
What sequence causes it to blow?
I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t know...

Something in the initializing code?
And all I have to do is think of it!
Something in the listing will show me...
I don&apos;t want to leave it now
I&apos;ll fix this tonight I vow!

JUST LIKE A BABY

A young couple were on their way to Vegas to get married. Before
getting there, the girl said to the guy that she had a confession to
make; the reason that they have not been too intimate is because she is
very flat chested. If the guy wishes to cancel the wedding, it is okay
with her. The guy thought about it for a while, and said he does not
mind she is flat, and sex is not the most important thing in a marriage.

Several miles down the road, the guy turned to the girl and said that he
also wants to make a confession; he said below his waist, it is just
like a baby. If the girl wants to cancel the marriage, it is okay with
him. The girl thought about it for a while and said that she does not
mind, and she also believed there are other things far more important
than sex in a marriage.

They were happy that they were honest with each other. They went on to
Vegas and got married.

On their wedding night, the girl took off her clothes; she is as flat as
a washboard. Finally, the guy took off his clothes. After one glance
at the guy&apos;s naked body, the girl fainted and fell to the floor.

When she became conscious, the guy asked,&quot;I told you before we got
married. Why did you still faint?&quot;

The girl said,&quot;You told me it was just like a baby.&quot;

The guy replied,&quot;It is! 8 pounds and 21 inches long

1. The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most
expensively saved animals were released back into the wild amid cheers
and applause from onlookers. A minute later they were both eaten by a
killer whale.

2. A psychology student in New York rented out her spare room to a
carpenter in order to nag him constantly and study his reactions. After
weeks of needling, he snapped and beat her repeatedly leaving her
mentally retarded.

3. In 1992, Frank Perkins of Los Angeles made an attempt on the world
flagpole-sitting record. Suffering from the flu he came down eight
hours short of the 400 day record to find that his sponsor had gone bust
, his girlfriend had left him and his phone and electricity had been cut
off.

4. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
the electric skillet. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly

current she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, bre
aking his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily
listening to his Walkman.

5. Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn&apos;t pay enough postage on a letter

Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It
is narrowed down to the RUSSIAN or the AMERICAN for the gold medal.
Before the final match, the American wrestler&apos;s trainer comes to him and
says,&quot;Now don&apos;t forget all the research we&apos;ve done on this Russian.
He&apos;s never lost a match because of this&quot;pretzel&quot;hold he has.

Whatever you do, don&apos;t let him get you in this hold! If he does,
you&apos;re finished!&quot;

The wrestler nods in agreement.

Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circle each other
several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian
lunges forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the
dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment goes up from the crowd,

and the trainer buries his face in his hands for he knows all is lost.
He can&apos;t watch the ending.

Suddenly there&apos;s a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer
raises his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air.
The Russian&apos;s back hits the mat with a thud, and the American weakly
collapses on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match.

The trainer is astounded! When he finally gets the American wrestler
alone, he asks,&quot;How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has
ever done it before!&quot;The wrestler answers,&quot;Well, I was ready to give

up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my
eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. I thought I

had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out
my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.

&quot;You&apos;d be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!&quot;

The Dr. checks on his patient, waiting for her to come out from under
the anesthesia from surgery.....

When she awoke, she looked at the Dr. and asked&quot;Will I ever have a
normal sex life again Dr.?&quot;You can be honest with me Dr., Will I ever
have a normal sex life again?&quot;

The Dr. gives her a real funny look....

The look on the Dr.&apos;s face makes her PANIC! She screams at the Dr.
&quot;Did something go wrong?! Please tell me if I&apos;ll ever have a normal sex
life again!

The doctor looks at his patient and replies.....

&quot;It&apos;s just that I have never had anyone ask me that question after a
tonsillectomy before, Monica.&quot;

The birds and the bees and the way things work:

Mother is in the kitchen making supper for her family when her youngest
daughter walks in.

Child: Mother, where do babies come from?

Mom: Well, dear... a mommy and daddy fall in love and get married. One
night, they go into their room. They kiss and hug and have sex. [The
daughter looks puzzled.] That means the daddy puts his penis in the
mommy&apos;s vagina. That&apos;s how you get a baby, honey.

Child: Oh I see, but the other night when I came into you and daddy&apos;s
room you had daddy&apos;s penis in your mouth. What do you get when you do
that?

Mom: Jewelry, honey.

The birds and the bees and the way things work:
Little Johnny and Jane are playing in the garden when they start
having an argument about whether boys are better than girls. After a
while Johnny stands up and pulls down his shorts. He says,&quot;Boys are
better than girls &apos;cause you haven&apos;t got one of these!&quot;Jane looks at
him in astonishment. She knows that she hasn&apos;t got one of those
between her legs. She bursts out crying and rushes inside to her
mother. A little while later she comes back out with a big smile on
her face.&quot;My mom says girls are better than boys,&quot;she says.&quot;No
they&apos;re not,&quot;says Johnny, who again pulls down his shorts.&quot;You
haven&apos;t got one of these!&quot;Jane looks at him. Then she raises her
skirt, pulls down her panties, and says,&quot;My mom says that as long as
I&apos;ve got one of these I can have as many of those as I want!&quot;

WOMEN SPEAK IN ESTROGEN AND MEN LISTEN IN TESTOSTERONE
by Matt Groening (The Simpsons&apos; originator)

RELATIONSHIPS:
When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her
girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled&quot;All Men Are Idiots&quot;. The
n she will get on with her life.
A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the
break-u p, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say,&quot;I
just wanted to l et you know you ruined my life, and I&apos;ll never forgive
you, and I hate you, and you&apos;re a total floozy. But I want you to know
that there&apos;s always a cha nce for us.&quot;This is known as the&quot;I Hate You
I Love You&quot;drunken phone call , and 99% of all men have made it at
least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men
get over this need.


SEX:
Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of for
eplay.

Men consider driving back to his place or hers as part of the foreplay.


MATURITY:
Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can
function as adults.

Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each
other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely
work out.

MAGAZINES:
Men&apos;s magazines often feature pictures of naked women.

Women&apos;s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. This is becaus
e the female body is a beautiful work of art.

LAUNDRY:
Women do laundry every couple of days.

A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his
surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do
his laundry When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty
sweatshirt inside out , rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes
to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the
Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated b y re- runs of old American
sitcoms.

EATING OUT:
When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20
bills, even though it&apos;s only for $22.50. None of them will have
anything small er, and none will actually admit they want change back.

When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.

MIRRORS:
Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror.

Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny
surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, Joe Garagiola&apos;s head.

MENOPAUSE:
When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of
complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The
nature and degree of these changes varies with the individual.

Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction-- he buys aviator
glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes
shopping for a Po rsche.

RICHARD GERE:
Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way.

Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who
works at the health club and dates only married women.

MADONNA:
Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.

TOYS:
Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11
or 12, they lose interest.

Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older,
their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.
Examples of men&apos;s toys: little miniature TV&apos;s. Car phones.
Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots
that serve cocktails on com mand. Video games. Anything that blinks,
beeps, and requires at least 6&quot;D&quot;batteries to operate.

LOCKER ROOMS:
In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and
wom en. They exaggerate about money, they don&apos;t know football nearly as
well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.

Women talk about one thing in the locker: sex. And not in abstract
terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never
lie.

MOVIES:
Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This
is because a man has produced every movie in the history of movies.

Men will only show their asses, because ass size doesn&apos;t really matter.

JEWELRY:
Women look nice when they wear jewelry.

A man can get away with wearing one ring and that&apos;s it. Any more than
that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.

TIME:
When a woman says she&apos;ll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she&apos;s
using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just
has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting timeouts,
commercials, or replays.

FRIENDS:
Women on a girl&apos;s night out talk the whole time.

Men on a boy&apos;s night out say about twenty words all night, most of which
are&quot;Pass the Doritos&quot;or&quot;Got any more beer?&quot;

RESTROOMS:
Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms as
social lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each
other. Women who&apos;ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together
like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man
excused himself from a restaurant table by saying,&quot;Hey, Tom, I was just
about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?&quot;

The following letter was forwarded by someone who teaches at a junior
high school in Memphis, Tennessee; the letter was sent to the
principal&apos;s office after the school had sponsored a luncheon for the
elderly. This story is a credit to all human kind. Read it,soak it in,
and bask in the warm feeling that it leaves you with.


Dear Reyer School:
God bless you for the beautiful radio I won at your recent senior
citizen&apos;s luncheon. I am 84 years old and live at the county home for
the aged. All my people are gone. It&apos;s nice to know that someone
thinks of me. God bless you for your kindness to an old forgotten lady.
My roommate is 95 and always had her own radio, but would never let me
listen to it. The other day her radio fell and broke into a lot of
pieces. It was awful. She asked if she could listen to mine, and I
said fuck you.

Sincerely,
Edna Johnston

 Ballroom dancing is a major at Brigham Young University. Some biblical scholars believe that Aramaic (the language of the 


ancient Bible) did not contain an easy way to say &apos;many things&apos; and used
a term which has come down to us as 40. This means that when the bible
in many places refers to &apos;40 days,&apos; they meant many days.

5. No word in the English language rhymes with month, orange, silver,
and purple.

6. Clans of long ago that wanted to get rid of their unwanted people
without killing them use to burn their houses down - hence the
expression &apos;to get fired.&apos;

 Canada is an Indian word meaning &apos;Big Village&apos;. There are two credit cards for every person in the United States. Only two people signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 


John Hancock and Charles Thomson. Most of the rest signed on August 2,
but the last signature wasn&apos;t added until 5 years later.

 &apos;I am.&apos; is the shortest complete sentence in the English language. The term &apos;the whole 9 yards&apos; came from WWII fighter pilots in the 


South Pacific. When arming their airplanes on the ground, the .50
caliber machine gun ammo belts measured exactly 27 feet, before being
loaded into the fuselage. If the pilots fired all their ammo at a
target, it got &apos;the whole 9 yards.&apos;

12. The original story from Tales of 1001 Arabian Nights begins,
&apos;Aladdin was a little Chinese boy.&apos;

 Winston Churchill was born in a ladies&apos; room during a dance. The most common name in the world is Mohammed. The &apos;y&apos; in signs reading &apos;ye olde..&apos; is properly pronounced with a 


&apos;th&apos; sound, not &apos;y&apos;. The &apos;th&apos; sound does not exist in Latin, so ancient
Roman occupied (present day) England use the rune &apos;thorn&apos; to represent
&apos;th&apos; sounds. With the advent of the printing press the character from
the Roman alphabet which closest resembled thorn was the lower case &apos;y&apos;.

 The international telphone area code for Antarctica is 672. The glue on Israeli postage stamps is certified kosher. The little bags of netting for gas lanterns (called &apos;mantles&apos;) are 


radioactive so much so that they will set of an alarm at a nuclear
reactor.

 Mel Blanc (the voice of Bugs Bunny) was allergic to carrots. Cinderella&apos;s slippers were originally made out of fur. The story 


was changed in the 1600s by a translator.

21. It was the left shoe that Aschenputtel (Cinderella) lost at the
stairway, when the prince tried to follow her.

22. Until 1965, driving was done on the left-hand side on roads in
Sweden. The conversion to right-hand was done on a weekday at 5pm. All
traffic stopped as people switched sides. This time and day were chosen
to prevent accidents where drivers would have gotten up in the morning
and been too sleepy to realize *this* was the day of the changeover.

Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the
&quot;in-flight safety lecture&quot;a bit more entertaining. Here are some
real examples that have been heard or reported:

&quot;There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4
ways out of this airplane...&quot;

&quot;Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event
of an emergency water landing, please take them with our
compliments.&quot;

&quot;We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must smoke,
contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the
wing of the airplane.&quot;

&quot;Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught
smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane
immediately.&quot;

Pilot -&quot;Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am
going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as
you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it&apos;s a
bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight
pattern.&quot;

And, after landing:&quot;Thank you for flying Delta Business Express.
We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed
taking you for a ride.&quot;

As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross in
front of us, some of the passengers were beginning to retrieve
luggage from the overhead bins. The head attendant announced on the
intercom,&quot;This aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance
system that monitors the cabin during taxiing. Any passengers not
remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and
complete stop at the gate will be strip-searched as they leave the
aircraft.&quot;

Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said,&quot;We&apos;ve reached our
cruising altitude now, and I&apos;m turning off the seat belt sign. I&apos;m
switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with
all of you for the rest of the flight.&quot;

As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National,
a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker:&quot;Whoa, big
fella...WHOA..!&quot;

&quot;Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the
overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose
before assisting children or adults acting like children.&quot;

&quot;As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your
belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among
the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.&quot;

&quot;Last one off the plane must clean it.&quot;

This is an actual joke heard on Southwest Airlines, just after a
very hard landing in Salt Lake City; one of the most bone jarring
ever experienced. The flight attendant came on the intercom and
said,&quot;That was quite a bump and I know what ya&apos;ll are thinking.
I&apos;m here to tell you it wasn&apos;t the airline&apos;s fault, it wasn&apos;t the
pilot&apos;s fault, it wasn&apos;t the flight attendants&apos; fault..... it was
the asphalt!&quot;

An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had
hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a
policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while
the passengers exited, give a smile, and a&quot;Thanks for flying XYZ
airline.&quot;He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard
time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would
have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for
this little old lady walking with a cane. She said,&quot;Sonny, mind if
I ask you a question?&quot;&quot;Why no M&apos;aam,&quot;said the pilot,&quot;what is
it?&quot;The little old lady said,&quot;Did we land or were we shot down?&quot;

From a Southwest Airlines employee....&quot;Welcome aboard Southwest
Flight XXX, to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab
into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other
seatbelt, and if you don&apos;t know how to operate one, you probably
shouldn&apos;t be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden
loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling.
Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you
have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before
assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small
children, decide now which one you love more.

Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds,
but they&apos;ll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you,
and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest
Airlines.&quot;

Butcher Dance

A guy has spent five years traveling all around the world making a
documentary on Native dances. At the end of this time, he has every
single native dance of every indigenous culture in the world on film.
He winds up in Australia, in Alice Springs, so he pops into a pub for
a well earned beer. He gets talking to one of the local Aborigines and
tells him about his project.

The Aborigine asks the guy what he thought of the&quot;Butcher Dance.&quot;

The guy&apos;s a bit confused and says,&quot;Butcher Dance? What&apos;s that?&quot;

&quot;What? You no see Butcher Dance?&quot;

&quot;No, I&apos;ve never heard of it.&quot;

&quot;Oh mate. You crazy. How you say you film every native dance if you no
see Butcher Dance?&quot;

&quot;UmmSUM. I got a corroborree on film just the other week. Is that what
you mean?&quot;

&quot;No no, not corroborree. Butcher Dance much more important than
corroborree.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well how can I see this Butcher Dance then?&quot;

&quot;Mate, Butcher Dance right out bush. Many days travel to go see
Butcher Dance.&quot;

&quot;Look, I&apos;ve been everywhere from the forests of the Amazon, to deepest
darkest Africa, to the frozen wastes of the Arctic filming these
dances. Nothing will prevent me from recording this one last dance.&quot;

&quot;OK, mate. You drive north along highway towards Darwin. After you
drive 197 miles, you see dirt track veer off to left. Follow dirt
track for 126 miles &apos;til you see big huge dead gum tree - biggest tree
you ever see. Here you gotta leave the car, because much too
rough for driving.

You strike out due west into setting sun. You walk 3 days &apos;til you
hit creek. You follow this creek to Northwest. After 2 days you find
where creek flows out of rocky mountains. Much too difficult to
cross mountains here though. You now head south for half day &apos;til
you see pass through mountains.

Pass very difficult and very dangerous. Take 2, maybe 3 days to get
through rocky pass. When through, head northwest for 4 days &apos;til
reach big huge rock - 20 ft high and shaped like man&apos;s head. From
rock, walk due west for 2 days and you find village. Here you see
Butcher Dance.&quot;

So the guy grabs his camera crew and equipment and heads out. After a
couple of hours he finds the dirt track. The track is in a shocking
state and he&apos;s forced to crawl along at a snail&apos;s pace and so he
doesn&apos;t reach the tree until dusk and he&apos;s forced to set up camp for
the night.

He sets out bright and early the following morning. His spirits are
high and he&apos;s excited about the prospect of capturing on film this
mysterious dance which he had never heard mention of before.

True to the directions he has been given, he reaches the creek after
three days and follows it for another two until they reach the rocky
mountains. The merciless sun is starting to take its toll by this time
and his spirits are starting to flag, but wearily he trudges on until
he finds the pass through the hills - nothing will prevent him from
completing his life&apos;s dream.

The mountains prove to be every bit as treacherous as their guide said
and at times the team almost despaired of getting their bulky equipment
through. But after three and a half days of back breaking effort they
finally force their way clear and continue their long trek.

When they reach the huge rock, four days later, their water is running
low and their feet are covered with blisters. Yet they steel
themselves and head out on the last leg of their journey.

Two days later they virtually stagger into the village where the
natives feed them and give them fresh water. They begin to feel like
new men.

Once he&apos;s recovered enough, the guy goes before the village chief and
tells him that he has come to film there Butcher Dance.

&quot;Oh mate. Very bad you come today. Butcher Dance last night. You too
late. You miss dance.&quot;

&quot;Well, when do you hold the next dance?&quot;

&quot;Not &apos;til next year.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&apos;ve come all this way. Couldn&apos;t you just hold an extra dance
for me, tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no! Butcher Dance very holy. Only hold once a year. If hold
more, gods get very angry and destroy village! You want see Butcher
Dance you come back next year.&quot;

The guy is devastated, but he has no other option but to head back to
civilization and back home.

The following year, he heads back to Australia and, determined not to
miss out again, sets out a week earlier than last time. He is quite
willing to spend a week in the village before the dance is performed
in order to ensure he is present to witness it. However, right from
the start things go wrong.

Heavy rains that year have turned the dirt track to mud and the car
gets bogged every few miles, finally forcing them to abandon their
vehicles and slog through the mud on foot almost half the distance to
the tree.

They reach the creek and the mountains without any further hitch, but
halfway through the ascent of the mountain they are struck by a
fierce storm which rages for several days, during which they are
forced to cling forlornly to the mountainside until it subsides. It
would be suicide to attempt to scale the treacherous paths in the
face of such savage elements.

Then, before they have traveled a mile out from the mountains, one of
the crew sprains his ankle badly which slows down the rest of their
journey enormously, to the rock and then the village.

Eventually, having lost all sense of how long they have been
traveling, they stagger into the village at about 12:00 noon.

&quot;The Butcher Dance!&quot;gasps the guy.&quot;Please don&apos;t tell me I&apos;m too
late!&quot;

The chief recognizes him and says&quot;No, white fella. Butcher Dance
performed tonight. You come just in time.&quot;

Relieved beyond measure, the crew spends the rest of the afternoon
setting up their equipment - preparing to capture the night&apos;s ritual
on celluloid as dusk falls. The natives start to cover their bodies in
white paint and adorn themselves in all manner of bird&apos;s feathers and
animal skins.

Once darkness has settled fully over the land, the natives form a
circle around a huge roaring fire.

A deathly hush descends over performers and spectators alike as a
wizened old figure with elaborate swirling designs covering his entire
body enters the circle and begins to chant. Some sort of witch doctor
or medicine man, figures the guy and he whispers to the chief,
&quot;What&apos;s he doing?&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot;whispers the chief.&quot;You first white man ever to see most
sacred of our rituals. Must remain silent. Holy man, he asks that the
spirits of the dream world watch as we demonstrate our devotion to
them through our dance and, if they like our dancing, will they be so
gracious as to watch over us and protect us for another year.&quot;

The chanting of the Holy man reaches a stunning crescendo before he
moves himself from the circle. From somewhere the rhythmic pounding of
drums booms out across the land and the natives begin to sway to the
stirring rhythm.

The guy is becoming caught up in the fervor of the moment himself.
This is it. He now realizes beyond all doubt that his wait has not
been in vain. He is about to witness the ultimate performance of
rhythm and movement ever conceived by mankind.

The chief strides to his position in the circle and, in a big booming
voice, starts to sing,

He says,&quot;You butcher right arm in. You butcher right arm out.
You butcher right arm in and you shake it all about&quot;

CHAMPIONSHIP GOLD

The Pope met with his cardinals to discuss a proposal from Benjamin
Netanyahu, the leader of Israel.&quot;Your Holiness,&quot;said one of the
cardinals,&quot;Mr. Netanyahu wants to challenge you to a game of golf
to show the friendship and ecumenical spirit shared by the Jewish
and Catholic faiths.&quot;

The Pope thought it was a good idea, but he had never held a golf
club in his life.&quot;Have we not,&quot;he asked,&quot;a cardinal who
can represent me against the leader of Israel?&quot;

&quot;None that plays golf very well,&quot;a cardinal said.&quot;But,&quot;he
added,&quot;there is a man named Jack Nicklaus, an American golfer
who is a devout Catholic. We can offer to make him a cardinal,
then ask him to play Benjamin Netanyahu as your personal
representative. In addition to showing our spirit of cooperation,
we&apos;ll also win the match.&quot;Everyone agreed it was a great idea.
The call was made and, of course, Nicklaus was honored and
agreed to play.

The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the
Pope of the result.&quot;I have some good news and some bad news, Your
Holiness,&quot;said the golfer.

&quot;Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus,&quot;said the Pope.

&quot;Well, Your Holiness, I don&apos;t like to brag, but even though I&apos;ve played
some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have

ever played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My
drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful
and my putting was perfect. With all due respect, my play was
truly miraculous.&quot;

&quot;There&apos;s bad news?&quot;the Pope asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot;Nicklaus sighed.&quot;I lost to Rabbi Tiger Woods by three strokes.&quot;

God on Oral Sex

After having been commissioned by God to take a survey of how man was
doing on Earth, St. Peter now stood before his boss ready to present his
findings.

&quot;Tell me, St. Peter, what have you found out?&quot;God asked.

&quot;I&apos;m very sorry to have to tell you this, but the people are behaving in
a sinful manner. There&apos;s drugs, alcohol, murders, you name it - a
regular Sodom and Gomorrah.

But the worst is this new obsession with oral sex. According to my
survey, 88% of the population is doing it. Even four out of five
dentists recommend it. I&apos;m afraid it has reached epidemic proportions.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot;God said thoughtfully,&quot;Do you have any recommendations as to
what should be done to put an end to this sexual perversion?&quot;

&quot;I think we should send a message to everyone on Earth who engages in
oral sex. The contents of that message should tell them exactly what
will happen to them on Judgment Day if they do not stop this type of
activity.&quot;replied St. Peter.

&quot;That is an effective solution,&quot;God stated,&quot;but I think that instead
of punishing those who practice oral sex, we should reward those who
refrain from it. Let&apos;s send a letter that&apos;s personally signed by me to
each one of these good people.&quot;And so they did.

Do you know what the letter said?


Hmmm... You didn&apos;t get the letter either, huh??

&quot;Always Say I Love You&quot;
author unknown

Brittney loved basketball
Friends and parties too
And when it came to painting
That&apos;s all she wanted to do

She painted everything she saw
Brids, flowers, the sky
Somedays she sat at her window
And painted everything that passed her by

But lately she&apos;d been feeling woozy
Her muscles ached a lot
And her parents got kind of worried
So they took her to the doc

The doctor took a couple of tests
To see if everything was ok
Then the nurse came out with a look of sadness
And this is what she had to say;

&quot;I&apos;m sorry but you&apos;ve got leukemia,&quot;
&quot;You&apos;ve got about 3 months more.&quot;
Then Brittney got up and ran out of the room
And slammed the office door

She ran down the street screaming
And cried her eyes out dry
And stayed up all night
Wondering what it&apos;s like to die

Her parents held her tightly
And said,&quot;We love you,&quot;
&quot;We&apos;ll make your last few months the greatest,&quot;
&quot;We&apos;ll do anything for you.&quot;

So Brittney and her parents moved to Florida
To live by the sea
Because Brittney loved the ocean
And when she dies, that&apos;s where she wanted to be

She spent her days painting
And horseback riding in by the bay
But one day she met this guy
And his name was Jay

They collected seashells together
And talked about all kinds of things
And then one day while walking
He handed her a ring

It said that,&quot;I love you,&quot;
Which brought tears to Brittney&apos;s eyes
And when he put it on her finger
She began to cry

&quot;I&apos;ve got leukemia, and about a month more.&quot;
Then Jay said,&quot;No matter what, I love you,&quot;
&quot;And no matter what, you are the one I adore.&quot;

So they spent everyday together
And swam in the Atlantic all day
But Brittney was getting weaker
And it was hard for her stay awake

So one day Brittney painted her picture
And gave it to Jay
She said,&quot;I want you to remember me,&quot;
&quot;Even when I leave this place.&quot;

But one day while they were walking
And searching for seashells in the sand
Brittney collapsed and started to lose her breath
And said to Jay,&quot;Please hold my hand.&quot;

&quot;I love you more then anyone,&quot;
&quot;You are my only true love,&quot;
&quot;But now my time is up,&quot;
&quot;And I&apos;ll watch over you from above,&quot;

Then Brittney&apos;s body was lifeless
As she lay in Jay&apos;s arms
And he sat there all day
And kept her safe from harm

************************************************

I hope this teaches you a lesson
To tell someone you love them whenever you can
Because maybe they&apos;ll be gone tomorrow
And you wont be there to hold their hand

Because love is everything to everybody
Without it, the world would be dead
So always tell someone you love them
A parent, a lover, a friend

Two Dutch girls are riding their old rickety bikes down the back streets
of Amsterdam one late afternoon. As it turns closer towards dusk, the
increasing darkness of the streets starts making the two girls a little

never come this way before.&quot;

The other girl says,&quot;It&apos;s the cobblestones.&quot;

GIRL POWER
An English professor wrote the words,

A blonde and a redhead met in a bar after work for a drink, and
were watching the 6 o&apos;clock news. A man was shown threatening
to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. The blonde bet the redhead
$50 that he wouldn&apos;t jump, and the redhead replied,&quot;I&apos;ll take
that bet!&quot;Anyway, sure enough, he jumped, so the blonde gave
the redhead the $50 she owed. The redhead said&quot;I can&apos;t take
this, you&apos;re my friend&quot;. The blonde said&quot;No. A bet&apos;s a bet&quot;.
So the redhead said&quot;Listen, I have to admit, I saw this
earlier on the 5 o&apos;clock news, so I can&apos;t take your money&quot;.

The blonde replied&quot;Well, so did I, but I never thought he&apos;d
jump again!&quot;

TRUE STORY AND A GOOD LAUGH...
Cross my heart this happened to someone This guy lives in Westchester,
NY and goes to school at Ithaca College.

For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from
Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had
the courage.

Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the
courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for
Saturday night. Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his
buddies, and drinks like Prohibition is coming back. Saturday, he is in
such bad shape that he can&apos;t make it through twenty minutes without
either throwing up or using the bathroom. After several hours of this,
he is able to stop throwing up, but he is still running to the toilet
every 20 minutes. He doesn&apos;t want to cancel the date, because he&apos;s
afraid he won&apos;t ever talk to her again.

So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about
a 30 minute ride). They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself
during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the
appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the
entrees.

They decide to get dessert. During dessert, our hero feels another
rumbling, but doesn&apos;t want to look like a complete bathroom freak, so he
holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has
a bit of gas stored up. He decides to let this little bit of gas fly
right there at the table (discreetly, of course). Unfortunately, this
little bit of gas came with another little surprise.&quot;Oh crap,&quot;he
thinks (and feels).

Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately
leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise.
He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to
figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b)
start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and
they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way, he is walking like a cowboy.

On the way to the train station, they pass the Gap.&quot;Do you mind if I
run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?&quot;he asks.&quot;No
problem, I&apos;d like to look around too,&quot;she replies. They go into the
Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men&apos;s fashions are on the right, women&apos;s
fashions are on the left. They split up. Our hero grabs the first
sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a
pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items
to the register.

His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make
sure that she doesn&apos;t see him buying the pants. He doesn&apos;t even want
the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date
can read lips from 40 feet away)&quot;Just the pants.&quot;&quot;What?&quot;asks the Gap
girl.&quot;Just the pants!&quot;(Eyes still trained on his date.) Gap girl:
&quot;Oh, OK.&quot;He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they
leave the store.

They board the rain just before it leaves the station and find two seats
in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses
himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to
the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and
boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window.
After cleaning himself off, he opens he Gap bag and pulls out ...just
the sweater.

During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a fortune
teller of some local repute. In a dark and hazy room, peering into a
crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.

&quot;There&apos;s no easy way to say this, so I&apos;ll just be blunt: Prepare
yourself to be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible
death this year.&quot;

Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman&apos;s lined face, then at the
single flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep
breaths to compose herself. She simply had to know. She met the
fortune teller&apos;s gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her question.

A doctor had just finished a marathon sex session with one of
his patients. He was resting afterwards and was feeling a bit guilty
because he thought it wasn&apos;t really ethical to screw one of his
patients.

However, a little voice in his head said&quot;Lots of other doctors have
sex with their patients so its not like you&apos;re the first...&quot;.
This made the doctor feel a little bit better until still another
voice in his head said,&quot;... but they probably weren&apos;t veterinarians&quot;.

semen. If he doesn&apos;t do that 5 times a day, they&apos;ll explode, and he
would die instantly.

&quot;Oh, I am sorry&quot;, said the Queen.

On the next floor they passed a room where a young nurse was giving
a patient oral sex.

ON DATING:
- - - -Dating is pressure and tension. What is a date,
really, but a job interview that lasts all night? The only difference
between a date and a job interview is that in not many job interviews is
there a chance you&apos;ll end up naked at the end of it.&quot;Well, Bill, the
boss thinks you&apos;re the man for the job. Why don&apos;t you strip down and
meet some of the people you&apos;ll be working with?&quot;

- - - -What would the world be like if people said whatever they were
thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a
blind date last? About 13 seconds, I think.&quot;Oh, sorry, your rear end
is too big.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later.&quot;

ON SEX:
- - - -Seems to me the basic conflict between men and women,
sexually, is that men are like firemen. To men, sex is an emergency,
and no matter what we&apos;re doing we can be ready in two minutes. Women,
on the other hand, are like fire. They&apos;re very exciting, but the
conditions have to be exactly right for it to occur.


- - - -Men and women all in all, behave just like our basic sexual
elements. If you watch single men on a weekend night they really act
very much like sperm - all disorganized, bumping into their friends,
swimming in the wrong direction.&quot;I was first.&quot;&quot;Let me through.&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re on my tail.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s my spot.&quot;They&apos;re like the Three Billion
Stooges. But the egg is very cool:&quot;Well, who&apos;s it going to be? I can
divide. I can wait a month. I&apos;m not swimming anywhere.&quot;


- - - -The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman&apos;s point of view that men
are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That&apos;s why a
wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful, glowing bride and
some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device, created by women
because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom
chickens out, everybody just takes one step over, and she marries the
next guy.

There&apos;s this guy named Jack, and he has a girlfriend named Wendy.
Jack loves Wendy a lot. To prove how much he loves her, he gets
&quot;Wendy&quot;tattooed on his penis. When it&apos;s erect, it says her name,
and when deflated, it reads&quot;Wy&quot;.

So, when she sees her name on his masculine member, she is
overwhelmed.

He pops the question, and she accepts.

They decide to go to Jamaica for their honeymoon. Once there, they
try out all the local culture, including a nude beach. They are
having a great time, when Jack decides to get up from sunbathing
and get something to drink at the beach bar.

He walks over to the bar with his deflated love muscle, trying not
to let his eye wander and end up embarrassing himself.

He orders a drink from the guy at the bar, who is also naked.

He is surprised to note that the bartender also has&quot;Wy&quot;tattooed
on his penis!

Jack says to the guy,&quot;Wow, what a coincidence. So, you have a
girlfriend named &apos;Wendy&apos; and her name is tattooed on your dick
too?&quot;

The bartender looks slowly down at Jack&apos;s thing, back to his and
starts laughing. Flashing a wide grin, he says,&quot;No, mon. Mine says
&apos;Welcome to Jamaica. Have a nice day.&apos;&quot;

A magazine recently ran a&quot;Dilbert quotes&quot;contest. They were looking
for people to submit quotes from their real life Dilbert-type
managers.

Here are some of the submittals...

1. As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building
using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken next Wednesday
and employees will receive their cards in two weeks.(This was the
winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond,
Washington.)

2. What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter.
(Lykes Lines Shipping)

3. E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should
be used only for company business. (Accounting manager, Electric Boat
Company)

4. This project is so important, we can&apos;t let things that are more
important interfere with it. (Advertising/Marketing Manager, United
Parcel Service)

5. Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule. No one
will believe you solved this problem in one day! We&apos;ve been working on
it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I&apos;ll let you know
when it&apos;s time to tell them. (R&amp;D;supervisor, Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing/3M Corp.)

6. My Boss spent the entire weekend retyping a 25-page proposal that
only needed corrections. She claims the disk I gave her was damaged and
she couldn&apos;t edit it. The disk I gave her was write-protected. (CIO of
Dell Computers)

7. Quote from the Boss:&quot;Teamwork is a lot of people doing what &apos;I&apos;
say.&quot;(Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)

8.&quot;How About Friday?&quot;My sister passed away and her funeral was
scheduled for Monday. When I told my Boss, he said she died so that I
would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year. He then asked
if we could change her burial to Friday. He said,&quot;That would be better
for me.&quot;(Shipping executive, FTD Florists)

9.&quot;We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not
going to discuss it with the employees.&quot;(Switching supervisor, AT&amp;T;
Lone Lines Division)

10. We recently received a memo from senior management saying:&quot;This
is to inform you that a memo will be issued today regarding the subject
mentioned above.&quot;(Microsoft, Legal Affairs Division)

11. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him
concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be
soon enough. He said&quot;If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited
until tomorrow to ask for it!&quot;(New business manager, Hallmark Greeting
Cards.)

12. Speaking the Same Language: As director of communications I was
asked to prepare a memo reviewing our company&apos;s training programs and
materials. In the body of the memo one of the sentences mentioned the
&quot;pedagogical approach&quot;used by one of the training manuals. The day
after I routed the memo to the executive committee, I was called into
the HR director&apos;s office, and told that the executive vice president
wanted me out of the building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told
that she wouldn&apos;t stand for&quot;perverts&quot;(pedophilia?) working in her
company. Finally he showed me her copy of the memo, with her demand
that I be fired-and the word&quot;pedagogical&quot;circled in red. The HR
manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up in his
dictionary, and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he
told me not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later a memo
to the entire staff came out - directing us that no words which could
not be found in the local Sunday newspaper could be used in company
memos. A month later, I resigned. In accordance with company policy, I
created my resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday
paper. (Taco Bell Corporation)

13. This gem is the closing paragraph of a nationally-circulated memo
from a large communications company:&quot;(Company name) is endeavorily
determined to promote constant attention on current procedures of
transacting business focusing emphasis on innovative ways to better, if
not supersede, the expectations of quality!&quot;(Lucent Technologies)

Long ago, when sailing ships ruled the waves, a captain and his crew
were in danger of being boarded by a pirate ship. As the crew became
frantic, the captain bellowed to his First Mate,&quot;Bring me my red shirt!
&quot;The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain&apos;s red shirt, which the
captain put on and led the crew to battle the pirate boarding party.
Although some casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were
repelled.

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels
sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain,
calm as ever bellowed,&quot;Bring me my red shirt!&quot;And once again the
battle was on. However, the Captain and his crew repelled both boarding
parties, though this time more casualties occurred.

Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting
the day&apos;s occurrences when an ensign looked to the Captain and asked,
&quot;Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?&quot;

The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give,
exhorted,&quot;If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the
wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid.&quot;

The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man. As dawn
came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate
ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way.

The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his
usual command. The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed,&quot;Bring me my brown
pants!&quot;

A pair of Irish ditch diggers were repairing some road side damage
directly across the street from a house of ill repute when they
witnessed a Protestant Reverend lurking about and then ducking into the
house.&quot;Would you look at that Darby!&quot;said one to another.&quot;What a
shameful disgrace, those Protestant Reverends sinning in a house the
likes of that place!&quot;They both shook their heads in disgust and
continued their work.

A short time later they watched as a Jewish Rabbi looked around himself
cautiously and then darted into the house when he was satisfied no one
had spied him.&quot;Did ya see that Darby?&quot;the digger asked the other in
shock and disbelief.&quot;Is nothing holy to those Jewish people? I just
can&apos;t understand what the world is coming to these days. A man of the
cloth indulging himself in sins of the flesh. It&apos;s a shame, I tell ya!&quot;

Not long had passed when they saw a third man, a Catholic Priest,
lurking about the house looking around to see if any one was watching
and then quietly sneaking in the door.&quot;Oh no, Darby look!&quot;Said the
first digger removing his cap,&quot;One of the poor girls musta died.&quot;

I finally figured out why I am so tired:

The population of this country is 237 million. 104 million are
retired. That leaves 133 million to do the work.

There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the
work. Of this there are 29 million employed by the Federal Government.
That
leaves 19 million to do the work.

Four million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to do
the work.

Take from that the 14,800,000 who work for State and Local Governments
and we are left with 200,000 to do the work.

There are 188,000 ill and in hospitals, so we now have 12,000 to do
the work.

Now there are 11,998 people in prisons so there are just two people
left to do the work, you and me.

AND YOU ARE BUSY MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR E-MAIL!

The first area we use it for is chapped lips, cuts, and stuff like that.
The second area we use it for is sex.&quot;The first guy then asked,&quot;How
do you use Vaseline in sex?&quot;The second guy replied, ..we put it on the
doorknobs. That way...the kids can&apos;t come back in.&quot;

A guy goes into confession and says to the priest,&quot;Father, I&apos;m 80
years old, married, have four kids and 11 grandchildren, and last
night I had an affair and I made love to two 18 year old girls. Both
of them. Twice.&quot;The priest said:&quot;Well, my son, when was the last
time you were in confession?&quot;&quot;Never Father, I&apos;m Jewish.&quot;&quot;So then,
why are you telling me?&quot;&quot;I&apos;m telling everybody.&quot;

*******************************************************************

The rich couple was going out for the evening when the woman of the
house decided to give the butler, Randy, the rest of the night off.
She said they would be home very late and he should just enjoy his
night. Well, as it turned out the wife wasn&apos;t having a good time at
the party, and came home early. As she walks into the house she sees
Randy sitting by himself in the dining room. She calls for him to
follow her. She leads him into the master bedroom, where she closes
and locks the door. She looks at him and smiles.&quot;Randy. Take off my
dress.&quot;He does this carefully.&quot;Randy. Take off my stockings and
garter.&quot;He silently obeys her.&quot;Randy. Remove my bra and panties.&quot;
As he does this, the tension continues to mount. She looks at
him...&quot;Randy. If I ever catch you wearing my clothes again, you&apos;re
fired!&quot;

How Dogs and Men Are Alike

 Both keep moving...even when they are lost. Both take up too much space on the bed. Both have irrational fears about the vacuum cleaner. Both are threatened by their own kind. Neither understands what you see in cats. Both want dominance. Both do the dishes by licking them clean. Both chase cars. The larger ones tend to drool. The smaller ones tend to be more nervous. 


*******************

How Dogs Are Better Than Men

 Dogs don&apos;t have problems expressing affection in public. Dogs miss you when you are gone. You can train a dog. Dogs are very direct about wanting to go out. Dogs understand what&quot;NO&quot;means. Dogs mean it when they kiss you. When dogs play&quot;fetch&quot;, they don&apos;t laugh at how you throw. Dogs are colorblind. Dogs understand if some of their friends aren&apos;t allowed to come 


inside.


***************

Why Dogs are Better Than Women
1. Dogs understand that instincts are better than asking for
directions.

 Dogs like beer. Dogs don&apos;t hate their bodies. Dogs don&apos;t criticize. Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point 

across.

 Dogs never expect gifts. Dogs don&apos;t want to know about every other dog you&apos;ve ever had. Dogs don&apos;t let a magazine article guide their lives. You never have to wait for a dog, they&apos;re ready to go 24 hours a 

day.

 Dogs don&apos;t cry. Dogs love it when your friends come over. A dog&apos;s time in the bathroom is confined to a quick drink. Dogs don&apos;t expect you to call when you&apos;re running late - the 

later you are, the more excited they are to see you.

 Anyone can get a good-looking dog. Dogs find you amusing when you&apos;re drunk. Dogs don&apos;t mind if you give their offspring away. Dogs don&apos;t notice if you call them by another dog&apos;s name. If a dog is gorgeous, other dogs don&apos;t hate it. A dog&apos;s parents never visit. 


*******************************************************************

A dedicated UAW (United Auto Workers) union steward was attending
a convention in Las Vegas and decided to check out the local brothels
nearby.

When he got to the first one, he asked the Madame,&quot;Is
this a union house?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot;she replied,&quot;I&apos;m sorry it isn&apos;t.&quot;

&quot;Well, if I pay you $100, what cut do the girls get?&quot;

&quot;The house gets $80 and the girls get $20.&quot;Mightily offended at such
unfair dealings, the man stomped off down the street in search of a more

equitable, hopefully unionized shop.

His search continued until finally he reached a brothel where the
Madame responded,&quot;Why yes sir, this IS a union house.&quot;The man
asked,&quot;And if I pay you $100, what cut do the girls get?&quot;&quot;The
girls get $80 and the house gets $20.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s more like it!&quot;the UAW
man said.

He looked around the room and pointed to a stunningly attractive
blonde.

&quot;I&apos;d like her for the night.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m sure you would, sir,&quot;said the Madame, then, gesturing to an obese
sixty year-old woman in the corner,&quot;but Ethel here has seniority.&quot;

If Men Really Ruled The World (from November 1998 issue of Maxim
magazine)*

Any fake phone number a girl gave you would automatically forward your
call to her real number.

Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed an acceptable
response to&quot;I love you.&quot;

Hallmark would make&quot;Sorry, what was your name again?&quot;cards.

When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game,
she&apos;d appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during a
time-out.

Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a&quot;Nice
hustle, you&apos;ll get &apos;em next time&quot;would pretty much do it.

Birth control would come in ale or lager.

Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the NFL team
of your choice.

The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.

&quot;Sorry I&apos;m late, but I got really wasted last night&quot;would be an
acceptable excuse for tardiness.

At the end of the workday, a whistle would blow and you&apos;d jump out your
window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and right into your
car like Fred Flintstone.

It&apos;d be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned
helmets, and go pillage a nearby town.

Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the&quot;public
ugliness&quot;ordinance.

Tanks would be far easier to rent.

Garbage would take itself out.

Instead of beer belly, you&apos;d get&quot;beer biceps.&quot;

Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your
wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said,&quot;You&apos;re #1!&quot;

Valentine&apos;s Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur
in leap years.

On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you&apos;d get the day off to go
drinking. Mother&apos;s Day, too.

St. Patrick&apos;s Day, however, would remain exactly the same.
But it would be celebrated every month.

Cops would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the
pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.

Two words: Ally McNaked.

Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed off
the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event in
world history.

The victors in any athletic competition would get to kill and eat the
losers.

The only show opposite Monday Night Football would be Monday Night
Football from a Different Camera Angle.

It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you
returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.

Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.

When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded
with would actually reduce your fine. As in:
Cop:&quot;You know how fast you were going?&quot;
You:&quot;All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.&quot;
Cop:&quot;Nice one. That&apos;s $10 off.&quot;

Faucets would run&quot;Hot,&quot;&quot;Cold,&quot;and&quot;100 proof.&quot;

The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong.

People would never talk about how fresh they felt.

Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style.

Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of
conversation.

HUMAN

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would have produced
enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is
produced to create an atomic bomb.

The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to
squirt blood 30 feet.

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (So what
are you waiting for?)

Humans and Dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.
(Hmm............)

On average people fear spiders more than they do death.

The strongest muscle in the body is the TONGUE.

It&apos;s impossible to sneeze with your eyes open.

You can&apos;t kill yourself by holding your breath.

Americans on the average eat 18 acres of pizza every day.

Every time you lick a stamp, you&apos;re consuming 1/10 of a calorie.

Did you know that you are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork
than by a poisonous spider?

Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed
people do.

In ancient Egypt, Priests plucked every hair from their bodies,
including their eyebrows and eyelashes.

ANIMALS

A pig&apos;s orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (Not sure how they found this out)

A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times its own
weight and always falls over on its right side when intoxicated.

Polar bears are left handed. (Ever try shaking hands with the polar
bears?!)

The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds, that makes the catfish rank #1
for animal having the most taste buds.

The flea can jump 350 times its body length, that is like a human
jumping the length of a footbal1 field.

A cockroach will live nine days without it&apos;s head, before it starves to
death.

A gorilla&apos;s penis is 1/3 that of a human. (Wonder who&apos;s the brave
guy who did the measuring?)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day.

The giraffe has a black tongue that is 14 inches long and no vocal cords

Butterflies taste with their feet.

Elephants are the only animals that can&apos;t jump.

A cat&apos;s urine glows under a blacklight.

An ostrich&apos;s eye is bigger than its brain.

Starfish haven`t got brains.

THINGS I LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN ~

1. A ceiling fan motor is not strong enough to spin a seven year
old wearing a cape.

2. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four
walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.

3. When you hear the toilet flush and the words,&quot;Uh-oh,&quot;it&apos;s already
too late.

 Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36 


year-old man says they can only do it in the movies.

6. If you use a waterbed as home plate while wearing baseball shoes it
does not leak - it explodes.

7. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot
house 4 inches deep.

 Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old. Super glue is forever. McGyver can teach us many things we don&apos;t want to know. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still 


can&apos;t walk on water.

 Pool filters do not like Jell-O. VCR&apos;s do not eject PB&amp;J;sandwiches even though TV commercials show 


they do.

 Always look in the oven before you turn it on. The fire department has at least a 5 minute response time. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms 


dizzy.

 It will however make cats dizzy. Cats vomit twice their body weight when dizzy.

Beauty is more than skin deep at the Miss Vagina contest.

Amsterdam this week was the venue for the inaugural Miss Vagina contest
where hopeful young women from all around the world dropped their pants
to try and win the coverted title of, er, Miss Vagina 1998.

This was not just a passive line-up of pudenda, however - contestants
were also judged on their &apos;special&apos; talents. Miss Mexico was a hot
favourite when she opened a beer bottle with her bits - one spectator in

Amsterdam&apos;s Bronco Burlesque Barn fainted at the sight of it. But then
she was upstaged by Miss India who played the flute and then pulled not
one, not two, but THREE live snakes out of her tunnel of love.

However the crown and $1,500 top prize eventually went to Miss Denmark.
Her act? Well not only could she accomodate five ping pong balls
numbered 1 to 5 down below, she could also produce - with no hands - any

particular numbered ball on request. Now there&apos;s something that could
spice up the Powerball drawings...

Top Fifteen Biblical Ways to Acquire a Wife:

Have God create a wife for you while you sleep. Note: this will
cost you a rib.
-- Adam (Genesis 2:19-24)

(That&apos;s right: fourteen years of toil for a woman.)
-- Jacob (Genesis 29:15-30)

Cut off 200 foreskins off of your future father-in-law&apos;s enemies

Become the emperor of a huge nation and hold a beauty contest.
-- Xerxes or Ahasuerus (Esther 2:3-4)

When you see someone you like, go home and tell your parents,
&quot;I have seen a ...woman; now get her for me.&quot;
If your parents question your decision, simply say,&quot;Get her for
me. She&apos;s the one for me.&quot;
-- Samson (Judges 14:1-3)

Kill any husband and take HIS wife. (Prepare to lose four sons
though.)
-- David (2 Samuel 11)

Wait for your brother to die. Take his widow. (It&apos;s not just a
good idea, it&apos;s the law.)
-- Onan and Boaz (Deuteronomy or Leviticus, example
in Ruth.)

Don&apos;t be so picky. Make up for quality with quantity.
-- Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-3)

A wife?...NOT!!!
-- Paul (1 Corinthians 7:32-35)

A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor&apos;s office. After his
checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone.

He said,&quot;Your husband is suffering from a very severe disease, combined
with horrible stress. If you don&apos;t do the following, your husband will
surely die.&quot;

&quot;Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant, and make sure
he is in a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner
prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don&apos;t burden him with chores,
as he probably had a hard day. Don&apos;t discuss your problems with him, it
will only make his stress worse. And most importantly. make love with
your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim.&quot;

If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your
husband will regain his health completely.

On the way home, the husband asked his wife.

&quot;What did the doctor say?&quot;

&quot;You&apos;re going to die,&quot;she replied.

&quot;Reading my book,&quot;she replies as she thinks to herself, &apos;Is this guy
blind, or what?&apos;

&quot;You&apos;re in a restricted fishing area,&quot;he informs her.

&quot;But, Officer, I&apos;m not fishing. Can&apos;t you see that?&quot;

&quot;But you have all this equipment, Ma&apos;am. I&apos;ll have to take you in and
write you up.&quot;

&quot;If you do that I will charge you with rape,&quot;snaps the irate woman.

&quot;I didn&apos;t even touch you,&quot;grouses the sheriff.

&quot;Yes, that&apos;s true....but you have all the equipment...&quot;

MEN ARE FROM SEARS, WOMEN ARE FROM NORDSTROM:&quot;Just Her Size&quot;

I believe that, in general, women are saner than men. For example, if
you see people who have paid good money to stand in an outdoor stadium
on a freezing December day wearing nothing on the upper halves of their
bodies except paint, those people will be male.

Without males, there would be no such sport as professional lawn mower
racing. Also, there would be a 100 percent decline in the annual number
of deaths related to efforts to shoot beer cans off of heads. Also, if
women were in charge of all the world&apos;s nations, there would be, I
sincerely believe this, virtually no military conflicts, and if there
were a military conflict, everybody involved would feel just awful and
there would soon be a high-level exchange of thoughtful notes written on
greeting cards with flowers on the front, followed by a Peace Luncheon
(which would be salads, with the dressing on the side).

So I sincerely believe that women are wiser than men, with the exception
of one key area, and that area is: clothing sizes. In this particular
area, women are insane. When a man shops for clothes, his primary
objective is to purchase clothes that fit on his particular body. A man
will try on a pair of pants, and if those pants are too small, he&apos;ll try
on a larger pair, and when he finds a pair that fits, he buys them. Most
men do not spend a lot of time fretting about the size of their pants.
Many men wear jeans with the size printed right on the back label, so
that if you&apos;re standing behind a man in a supermarket line, you can read
his waist and inseam size. A man could have, say, a 52-inch waist and a
30-inch inseam, and his label will proudly display this information,
which is basically the same thing as having a sign that says:&quot;Howdy! My
butt is the size of a Federal Express truck!&quot;

The situation is very different with women. When a woman shops for
clothes, her primary objective is NOT to find clothes that fit her
particular body. She would like for that to be the case, but her primary
objective is to purchase clothes that are the size she wore when she was
19 years old. This will be some arbitrary number such as&quot;5&quot;or&quot;7.&quot;
Don&apos;t ask me&quot;5&quot;or&quot;7&quot;of what; that question has baffled scientists
for centuries. All I know is that if a woman was a size 5 at age 19, she
wants to be a size 5 now, and if a size 5 outfit does not fit her, she
will not move on to a larger size: She can&apos;t! Her size is 5! So she
will keep trying on size 5 items, and unless they start fitting her, she
will become extremely unhappy.

She may take this unhappiness out on her husband, who is waiting
patiently in the mall, perhaps browsing in the Sharper Image store,
trying to think of how he could justify purchasing a pair of
night-vision binoculars.&quot;Hi!&quot;he&apos;ll say, when his wife finds him.&quot;You
know how sometimes the electricity goes out at night and...&quot;&quot;Am I fat?&quot;
she&apos;ll ask, cutting him off. This is a very bad situation for the man,
because if he answers&quot;yes,&quot;she&apos;ll be angry because he&apos;s saying that
she&apos;s fat, and if he answers&quot;no,&quot;she&apos;ll be angry because HE&apos;S
OBVIOUSLY LYING BECAUSE NONE OF THE SIZE 5s FIT HER.

There is no escape for the husband. I think a lot of unexplained
disappearances occur because guys in malls see their wives
unsuccessfully trying on outfits, and they realize their lives will be
easier if, before their wives come out and demand to know whether
they&apos;re fat, the guys just run off and join a UFO cult.

The other day my wife, Michelle, was in a terrific mood, and you know
why? Because she had successfully put on a size 6 outfit. She said this
made her feel wonderful. She said, and this is a direct quote:&quot;I
wouldn&apos;t care if these pants were this big (here she held her arms far
apart) as long as they have a &apos;6&apos; on them.&quot;

Here&apos;s how you could get rich: Start a women&apos;s clothing store called
&quot;SIZE 2,&quot;in which all garments, including those that were originally
intended to be restaurant awnings, had labels with the words&quot;SIZE 2.&quot;
I bet you&apos;d sell clothes like crazy. You&apos;d probably get rich, and you
could retire, maybe take up some philanthropic activity to benefit
humanity. I&apos;m thinking here of professional lawn mower racing.

Don&apos;t Lie To Your Mother

John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother
couldn&apos;t help noticing how beautiful John&apos;s roommate was. She had long
been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate and this
only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she
started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than
met the eye.

Reading his mom&apos;s thoughts, John volunteered,&quot;I know what you must be
thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates.&quot;

About a week later, Julie came to John and said,&quot;Ever since your
mother came to dinner, I&apos;ve been unable to find the beautiful silver
gravy ladle.

&quot;You don&apos;t suppose she took it, do you?&quot;Julie said,

&quot;Well, I doubt it, but I&apos;ll write her a letter just to be sure.&quot;So he
sat down and wrote:

&quot;Dear Mother, I&apos;m not saying you &apos;did&apos; take a gravy ladle from my house,
and I&apos;m not saying you &apos;did not&apos; take a gravy ladle. But the fact
remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.&quot;

Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read:

&quot;Dear Son, I&apos;m not saying that you &apos;do&apos; sleep with Julie, and I&apos;m not
saying that you &apos;do not&apos; sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if
she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by
now.

One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner are
seated, waiting for the cockpit crew to show up so they can get under
way. The pilot and co-pilot finally appear in the rear of the plane, and
begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle.

Both appear to be blind. The pilot is using a white cane, bumping into
passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle, and the
co-pilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with
huge sunglasses.

At first the passengers do not react, thinking that it must be some sort
of practical joke. However, after a few minutes the engines start
spooling up and the airplane starts moving down the runway.

The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness, whispering among
themselves and looking desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.
Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin
panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and
closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more
hysterical.

Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left, there
is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at
once, and at the very last moment the airplane lifts off and is
airborne.

Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to
the Captain:&quot;You know, one of these days the passengers aren&apos;t going to
scream, and we&apos;re gonna get killed!&quot;

THE WINNER
 
 

PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his
constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a
bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged up pachyderm
finally let fly - and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop!
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the
ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on
him like a dump truck full of mud.&quot;The sheer force of the elephant&apos;s
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he
struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued
to evacuate his bowels on top of him,&quot;said flabbergasted Paderborn
police detective Erik Dern.&quot;With no one there to help him, he lay under

all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and
during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak
accidents.


OTHER CANDIDATES
 
 

1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in
two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch-wide
sewer grate to retrieve his car keys.

2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who&quot;totally
zoned when he ran,&quot;according to his wife, accidentally jogged off a
200-foot-high cliff on his daily run.

3. Buxton, NC: A man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug
into the sand caved in as he sat inside it. Beachgoers said Daniel
Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun, or protection from the wind, and had
been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday afternoon when it
collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand. People on the beach, on
the outer banks, used their hands and shovels, trying to claw their way
to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, VA, but could not reach him. It took
rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while
about 200 people looked on. Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital.

4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in Lompoc, CA, as he
fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was
burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in
his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as
he hit the floor.

5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, 20,
was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who
was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flak vest
Berrena was wearing.

6. Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26, was killed in February in Selbyville,
Del., as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver
loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger.

7. In February, according to police in Windsor, Ontario, Daniel Kolta,
27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus earning a
tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles.


HONORABLE MENTIONS (They survived)
 
 

1. In Guthrie, Okla , in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a millipede
with a shot from his 22-caliber rifle, but the bullet ricocheted off a
rock near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the head, fracturing
his skull.

2. In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Martyn Eskins, attempting to clean
cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in favor of a propane
torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second floors of his
house.

3. Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in Andover Township, NJ, in
September, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by a quarter-stick of
dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around at 2 AM, the
bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see
what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that the window
was closed.

4. Taking&quot;Amateur Night&quot;Too Far: In Betulia, Colombia, an annual
festival in November includes five days of amateur bullfighting. This
year, no bull was killed, but dozens of matadors were injured, including
one gored in the head and one &apos;Bobbitt-ized&apos;. Said one participant,
&quot;It&apos;s just one bull against [a town of] a thousand Morons.&quot;

of an online chat doesn&apos;t seem to quite get the point of cyber sex.
Then again, maybe he does...

Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?

Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high
heels. I work out every day, I&apos;m toned and perfect. My measurements
are 36-24-36. What do you look like?

Wellhung: I&apos;m 6&apos;3&quot;and about 250 pounds.I wear glasses and I
have on a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart.
I&apos;m also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it
from dinner...it smells funny.

Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?

Wellhung: OK

Sweetheart: We&apos;re in my bedroom.There&apos;s soft music playing on
the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table.I&apos;m looking
up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your
crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.

Wellhung: I&apos;m gulping, I&apos;m beginning to sweat.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.

Wellhung: Now I&apos;m unbuttoning your blouse.My hands are trembling.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m moaning softly.

Wellhung: I&apos;m taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m throwing my head back in pleasure.The cool silk
slides off my warm skin.I&apos;m rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and
rubbing.

Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally
rips a hole in your blouse.I&apos;m sorry.

Sweetheart: That&apos;s OK, it wasn&apos;t really too expensive.

Wellhung: I&apos;ll pay for it.

Sweetheart: Don&apos;t worry about it.I&apos;m wearing a lacy black bra.My
soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.

Wellhung: I&apos;m fumbling with the clasp on your bra.I think it&apos;s
stuck. Do you have any scissors?

Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly.I&apos;m reaching
back undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses
my breasts. My nipples are erect for you.

Wellhung: How did you do that? I&apos;m picking up the bra and
inspecting the clasp.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel
your tongue all over me.

Wellhung: I&apos;m dropping the bra. Now I&apos;m licking your, you know,
breasts. They&apos;re neat!

Sweetheart: I&apos;m running my fingers through your hair. Now I&apos;m
nibbling your ear.

Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit
and phlegm.

Sweetheart: What?

Wellhung: I&apos;m so sorry. Really.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the
remains of my blouse.

Wellhung: I&apos;m taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it
with a plop.

Sweetheart: OK. I&apos;m pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing
your hard tool.

Wellhung: I&apos;m screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!

Sweetheart: I&apos;m pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.

Wellhung: I&apos;m pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all
over, in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.

Sweetheart: What&apos;s the matter?

Wellhung: I&apos;ve got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I&apos;m
choking.

Sweetheart: Are you OK?

Wellhung: I&apos;m having a coughing fit

Sweetheart: Can I help?

Wellhung: I&apos;m running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I&apos;m fumbling
through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?

Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.

Wellhung: I&apos;m drinking a cup of water. There, that&apos;s better.

Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.

Wellhung: I&apos;m washing the cup now.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m on the bed arching for you.

Wellhung: I&apos;m drying the cup. Now I&apos;m putting it back in the cabinet.
And now I&apos;m walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it&apos;s dark, I&apos;m
lost. Where&apos;s the bedroom?

Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.

Wellhung: I found it.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m tuggin&apos; off your pants. I&apos;m moaning. I want you
so badly.

Wellhung: Me too.

Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our
naked bodies pressing each other.

Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.

Sweetheart Why don&apos;t you take off your glasses?

Wellhung: OK, but I can&apos;t see very well without them. I place the
glasses on the night table.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!

Wellhung: I have to pee. I&apos;m fumbling my way blindly across the
room and toward the bathroom.

Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.

Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it&apos;s dark. I&apos;m feeling around
for the toilet. I lift the lid.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m waiting eagerly for your return.

Wellhung: I&apos;m done going. I&apos;m feeling around for the flush
handle, but I can&apos;t find it. Uh-oh!

Sweetheart: What&apos;s the matter now?

Wellhung: I&apos;ve realized that I&apos;ve peed into your laundry hamper.
Sorry again. I&apos;m walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my
way.

Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.

Wellhung: OK, now I&apos;m going to put my...you know ...thing...in
your...you know...woman&apos;s thing.

Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!

Wellhung: I&apos;m touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I
kiss your neck. Umm, I&apos;m having a little trouble here.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can&apos;t
stand it another second! Slide in! Screw me now!

Wellhung: I&apos;m flaccid.

Sweetheart: What?

Wellhung: I&apos;m limp. I can&apos;t sustain an erection.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m standing up and turning around; an incredulous
look on my face.

Wellhung: I&apos;m shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner
all floppy. I&apos;m going to get my glasses and see what&apos;s wrong.

Sweetheart: No, never mind. I&apos;m getting dressed. I&apos;m putting on
my underwear. Now I&apos;m putting on my wet nasty blouse.

Wellhung: No wait! Now I&apos;m squinting, trying to find the night
table. I&apos;m feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair
spray,
picture frames and your candles.

Sweetheart: I&apos;m buttoning my blouse. Now I&apos;m putting on my shoes.

Wellhung: I&apos;ve found my glasses. I&apos;m putting them on. My God!
One of our candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I&apos;m
pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.

Sweetheart: Go to hell. I&apos;m logging off, you loser!

Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!

Sweetheart:&lt;logged off

Brenda O&apos;Malley is home making dinner as usual, when Tim Finnegan
arrives at her door.

&quot;Brenda, may I come in?&quot;he asks.&quot;I&apos;ve somethin&apos; to tell ya.&quot;

&quot;Of course you can come in. You&apos;re always welcome, Tim. But where&apos;s my
husband?&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m here to be tellin&apos; ya, Brenda. There was an accident
down at the Guinness brewery.&quot;

&quot;Oh, God no!&quot;cries Brenda.&quot;Please don&apos;t tell me...&quot;

&quot;I must, Brenda. Your husband Shamus is dead and gone. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;

Finally, she looked up at Tim.&quot;How did it happen, Tim?&quot;

&quot;It was terrible, Brenda. He fell into a vat of Guinness Stout and
drowned.&quot;

Oh my dear Jesus! But you must tell me true, Tim. Did he at least go
quickly?&quot;

&quot;Well, no Brenda, no.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;

&quot;Fact is, he got out three times to pee.&quot;

isn&apos;t that nice!.&quot;

They proceed to the next bull and his sign stated:&quot;This bull mated 65
times last year.&quot;

The wife turns to her husband and says,&quot;This one mated 65 times last
year. That is over 5 times a month. You could learn from this one!&quot;

They proceeded to the last bull and his sign said:&quot;This bull mated 365

times last year.&quot;The wife&apos;s mouth drops open and says,&quot;WOW! He mated
365 times last year. That is ONCE A DAY!!! You could really learn

A little poke at the NBA....

we can all give a little to help these&quot;poor&quot;players during this
difficult time...


     &quot;NBA PLAYER ADOPTION PROGRAM&quot;NEEDS YOU With an NBA player&apos;s strike
against the team owners, now is the time for us to show the world just
how much we care. It&apos;s just not right.

Hundreds of basketball players in our very own country are living at or
just below the seven-figure salary line. And as if that weren&apos;t bad
enough, they will be deprived of pay for several weeks-possibly a whole
year! But now you can help! For about two thousand dollars a day -
that&apos;s less than the cost of a large screen projection TV - you can help
keep a basketball player economically viable during his time of need.

Two thousand dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, but
to a basketball player it could mean the difference between a vacation
spent golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, two
thousand dollars is nothing more than three months rent or mortgage
payments. But to a basketball player, two thousand dollars a day will
almost replace his salary. Your commitment of two thousand dollars a
day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in
the year old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.

&quot;HOW WILL I KNOW I&apos;M HELPING?&quot;Each month, you will receive a complete
financial report on the player you sponsor. Detailed information about
his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate and other investment holdings
will be mailed to your home. You&apos;ll also get information on how he
plans to invest the $5 million lump sum he will receive upon retirement.

&quot;HOW WILL HE KNOW I&apos;M HELPING&quot;Your basketball player will be told that
he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need.
Although the player won&apos;t know your name, he will be able to make
collect calls to your home via a special operator just in case
additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses.

Simply fill out the form below.

YES, I want to help! I would like to sponsor a striking NBA
basketball player.
My preference is checked below:
[ ] Starter

Please charge the account listed below $2,054.79 per day for reserve or
starter for the duration of the strike. Please send me a picture of the
player I have sponsored, along with a team logo and my very own NBA

Players Association badge to wear proudly on my lapel.

Note: Sponsors are not permitted to contact the player they have
sponsored, either in person or by other means including, but not limited
to, telephone calls, letters, e-mail, or third parties. Keep in mind
that the basketball player you have sponsored will be much too busy
enjoying his free time, thanks to your generous donations. Oh yes,
contributions are not tax deductable.

Things we can learn from a dog:

 Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joy ride. Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be 

pure ecstasy.

 When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. When it&apos;s in your best interest, always practice obedience. Let others know when they&apos;ve invaded your territory. Take naps and always stretch before rising. Run, romp, and play daily. Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. Be loyal. Never pretend to be something you&apos;re not. If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it. When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle 

them gently.

 Delight in the simple joy of a long walk. Thrive on attention and let people touch you. Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree. When you are happy, dance around and wag your entire body. No matter how often you are criticized, don&apos;t buy into the guilt 


thing and pout. Run right back and make friends.

Nothing like evidence of low tide in the gene pool!

The first three are potential future winners as they have not yet
eliminated their DNA from the gene pool, but one can always hope!

Turn on your headlights!
AUGUSTA, ME - Four people were injured in a string of bizarre
accidents.Sherry Moeller was admitted with a head wound caused by flying
masonry, Tim Vegas was diagnosed with a mild case of whiplash and
contusions on his chest, arms and face, Bryan Corcoran suffered torn gum
tissue, and Pamela Klesick&apos;s first two fingers of her right hand had
been bitten off. Moeller had just dropped her husband off for his first
day of work and, in addition to a good-bye kiss, she flashed her breasts
at him.&quot;I&apos;m still not sure why I did it,&quot;she said later.&quot;I was
really close to the car, so I didn&apos;t think anyone would see. Besides, it
couldn&apos;t have been for more than two seconds. However, cab driver Vegas
did see, and lost control of is cab, running over the curb and into the
corner of the Johnson Medical Building. Inside, Klesick, a dental
technician, was cleaning Corcoran&apos;s teeth. The crash of the cab against
the building making her jump, tearing Corcoran&apos;s gums with a cleaning
pick. In shock, he bit down, severing two fingers from Klesick&apos;s hand.
Moeller&apos;s wound was caused by a falling piece of the medical building.


TAOS, NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating three
birth-control vaginal inserts. Her English was so bad she had to draw a
picture describing how she believed she had poisoned herself. A
translator arrived shortly thereafter and confirmed doctors&apos; suspicions.
Marie Valishnokov thought the inserts were some kind of candy or gum,
being unable to read the foil wrappers. After the third one, she
realized something was wrong when her throat and mouth began to fill
with a sour-tasting foam. She ran for the Poison Control Center, only a
few blocks away where doctors were able to flush the foam from her
mouth, throat and stomach with no ill effects.


TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham, had been drinking with several friends when
one of them said they knew a person who had bungee jumped from the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic. The conversation grew
more heated and at least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the bridge
at 4:30 a.m. Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered
that no one had brought bungee rope. Bingham, who had continued
drinking, volunteered and pointed out that a coil of cable had been left
near the railing. Bingham&apos;s tied one end to his leg and the other end
was tied to the bridge. His fall lasted 40 feet before the cable
tightened and tore his foot off at the ankle. He miraculously survived
his fall into the icy river water and was rescued by two nearby
fishermen. All I can say,&quot;said Bingham,&quot;is that God was watching out
for me on that night. There&apos;s just no other explanation for it.&quot;
Bingham&apos;s foot was never located.

Nominee #1
On February 3, 1990, a Renton, Washington man tried to commit a robbery.
This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by the fact that he
had no previous record of violent crime, and by his terminally stupid
choices as listed below:

 The target was H&amp;J;Leather&amp;Firearms, a gun shop; The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial 


portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns
in public places;
3. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car
parked at the front door;
4. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having
coffee before reporting to duty.
Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and
fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire,
removing him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their
guns, but didn&apos;t fire. No one else was hurt.

Nominee #2
MOSCOW, RUSSIA -A drunk security man asked a colleague at the Moscow
bank they were guarding to stab his bullet-proof vest to see if it would
protect him against a knife attack. It didn&apos;t, and the 25-year-old guard
died of a heart wound. (It&apos;s good to see the Russians getting into the
spirit of the Darwin Awards.)

Nominee #3
In France, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he decided to
commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied a noose
around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He
drank some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot
himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet
missed him completely and cut through the rope above him. Free of the
threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden dunking
extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison. He was dragged
out of the water by a kind fisherman and was taken to a hospital, where
he died ... of hypothermia.

And the winner is:
Japan Times-April 16, 1997&quot;The government must crack down on this
disgusting craze of&quot;Pumping&quot;, a spokesman for the Nakhon Ratchasima
hospital told reporters.&quot;If this perversion catches on, it will destroy
the cream of Thailand&apos;s manhood.&quot;He was speaking after the remains of
13 year-old Charnchai Puanmuangpak had been rushed into the hospital&apos;s
emergency room.&quot;Most &apos;Pumpers&apos; use a standard bicycle pump,&quot;he
explained,&quot;inserting the nozzle far up their rectum, giving themselves
a rush of air, creating a momentary high. This act is a sin against
God.&quot;Charnchai took it further still. He started using a two-cylinder
foot pump, but even that wasn&apos;t exciting enough for him, and he boasted
to friends that he was going to try the compressed air hose at a nearby
gasoline station. They dared him to do it so, under cover of darkness,
he snuck in. Not realizing how powerful the machine was, he inserted
the tube deep into his rectum, and placed a coin in the slot. As a
result, he died virtually instantly, but passers-by are still in shock.

One woman thought she was watching a twilight fireworks display, and
started clapping.&quot;We still haven&apos;t located all of him.&quot;, say the police
authorities.&quot;When that quantity of air interacted with the gas in his
system, he nearly exploded. It was like a bomb went off or something.&quot;

&quot;Pumping is the devil&apos;s pastime, and we must all say no to Satan,
&quot;Ratchasima concluded.&quot;Inflate your tires by all means, but then hide
your bicycle pump where it cannot tempt you.&quot;

Let&apos;s hear it for Charnchai Puanmuangpak, the NEW 1998 undisputed Darwin
Awards recipient!


Other Idiots

Randy Nestor, 28, was a considerate car thief. When the stolen cars
became hot, he didn&apos;t just abandon them, he torched them. Setting the
cars on fire, he reasoned, helped the owners collect insurance on their
vehicles. This criminal habit became his downfall. After a 10-year
career of theft, Randy burned to death in Pittsburgh, PA in a van which
he had set fire to from the inside. He hadn&apos;t realized that the door
handle on the driver&apos;s side was broken. Friends tried to release him,
but the door was locked. His burned body was found insidethe van on
Sunday, 1 March 1998.

Did he win the argument? It happened in February 1998 in a
working-class Boedo neighborhood in Buenos Aires. During a heated
marital dispute, a 25-year-old man picked up his 20-year-old wife and
threw her off their eighth-floor apartment balcony. To his dismay, she
became tangled in the power lines below. He immediately leapt from the
balcony and fell towards his wife. We can only speculate as to his
reasons. Was he angrily trying to finish the job, or was he remorsefully
hoping to rescue her? He did not accomplish either goal. He missed the
power lines completely, and plunged to his death. The woman managed to
swing over to a nearby balcony and was saved.

Hungry or just stupid? January 29, 1998, was a fateful day for Michael
Pentner. He was shooting the breeze with a group of men, watching a
friend clean his fish tank. Alcoholic beverages may have been present.
The friend complained that one fish in particular had become a menace.
It had outgrown the tank and was eating other specimens. Michael
volunteered to assist. He seized the 5-inch fish and attempted to
swallow it. Unfortunately, it stuck in his throat. As Michael gasped
futilely for breath, turned blue, and sank to his knees, his three
friends realized that something was amiss. They contacted 911 and
informed the dispatcher that Gentner had eaten some fish, and was having
trouble breathing. Paramedics were quickly dispatched. They arrived to
find the fish tail still protruding from the victim&apos;s mouth. Despite
their best efforts, the 23-year-old could not be resuscitated. The
killer fish had claimed one last victim. Although the friends did not
attempt the Heimlich maneuver or administer CPR, Akron, Ohio police
said it was unlikely that murder charges would be filed.&quot;If I dare you
to jump off a bridge and you do it, you&apos;re stupid,&quot;police Maj. Mike
Matulavich said. Apparently Michael Gentner was not a victim of
homicide, he was just a Darwin Awards contender.

A Melbourne, Australia man was playing basketball with his brother and
16-year-old cousin, using a hoop affixed to his garage. After
slam-dunking the ball, he hung on the rim for a triumphant moment. The
bricks gave way and the wall collapsed on the 20-year-old man, fatally
crushing him. His name was withheld by authorities, at the request of
his family. Melbourne, Australia is not the safest place to play
basketball. Ryan Maloney, 19, died in 1996 in a public basketball court
when the ring collapsed on him after a dunk. The coroner recommended
that dunking basketballs be banned. No heed was taken of his words. The
tradition is still practiced throughout the world.

Wayne Roth, 38, of Pittston, PA, was bitten by a cobra belonging to his
friend, Roger Croteau, after playfully reaching into the tank and
picking up the snake. Wayne subsequently refused to go to a hospital,
telling Roger,&quot;I&apos;m a man, I can handle it.&quot;Falser words have seldom
been spoken. Instead of a hospital, Wayne reported to a bar. He had
three drinks, and enjoyed bragging that he had just been bitten by a
cobra. Cobra venom is a slow-acting central nervous system toxin. He
died within a few hours, in Jenkins Township, Pennsylvania. (November
1997)

Two people were disassembling an electric tower with wrenches when it
toppled Tuesday afternoon. The teens apparently wanted to sell its
aluminum supports for scrap. One of the teens was crushed by the tower
and the other dug himself out from under the 160&apos; 10,000 pound tower.

A security guard intending to impress female friends took a deadly
gamble, losing his game of Russian roulette at a La Paz fast-food
restaurant. Police say Victor Alba, 21, died instantly Saturday when he
put his .38-caliber revolver to his head and pulled the trigger at a
suburban hamburger outlet. Alba was trying to&quot;impress some female
friends,&quot;according to the newspaper Hoy de La Paz.

In Wesley Chapel, Florida, Joseph Aaron, 20, was hit in the leg with
pieces of the bullet he fired at the exhaust pipe of his car. When
repairing the car, he needed to bore a hole in the pipe. When he
couldn&apos;t find a drill, he tried to shoot a hole in it.

Jokes!
A man boards an airplane, and takes his seat. As he settles in, he
glances up and sees the most beautiful woman boarding the plane. He
soon realizes she is heading straight towards his seat. A wave of
nervous anticipation washes over him. Lo and behold, she takes the seat
right beside his. Anxious to strike up a conversation, he blurts out,
&quot;So where are you flying to today?&quot;

She turns and smiles, and says,&quot;To the annual Nymphomaniac Convention,
in Chicago.&quot;

Whoa! He swallows hard, and is instantly CRAZED with excitement!
Here&apos;s the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen sitting RIGHT next to
him, and she&apos;s going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs! Struggling to
maintain his outward cool, he calmly asks,&quot;And what&apos;s your role at this
convention?&quot;

She flips her hair back, turns to him, locks onto his eyes, and says,
&quot;Well, I try to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot;he says, swallowing hard.&quot;And what myths are those?&quot;

She explains:&quot;Well, one popular myth is that African American men are
the most well-endowed when, in fact, it is the Native American who is
most likely to possess this trait. Another popular myth is that
Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it&apos;s members of the Jewish
descent that romance women best, on average.&quot;

&quot;Very interesting,&quot;the man responds.

Suddenly, the woman becomes very embarrassed, and blushes.&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot;

she says,&quot;I feel so awkward discussing this with you, and I don&apos;t even
know your name!&quot;

The man extends his hand and replies,&quot;Tonto,..Tonto Goldstein.&quot;

A man walked in to Joe&apos;s Barber Shop for his regular haircut. As he
snips away, Joe asks&quot;What&apos;s up?&quot;

The man proceeds to explain he&apos;s taking a vacation to Rome.

&quot;ROME?!&quot;Joe says,&quot;Why would you want to go there? It&apos;s a crowded dirty
city full of Italians! You&apos;d be crazy to go to Rome! So how ya getting
there?&quot;

&quot;We&apos;re taking TWA,&quot;the man replies.

&quot;TWA?!&quot;yells Joe.&quot;They&apos;re a terrible airline. Their planes are old,
their flight attendants are ugly and they&apos;re always late! So where you
staying in Rome?&quot;

The man says&quot;We&apos;ll be at the downtown International Marriot.&quot;

&quot;That DUMP?!&quot;says Joe.&quot;That&apos;s the worst hotel in the city! The rooms
are small, the service is surly and slow and they&apos;re overpriced! So
whatcha doing when you get there?&quot;

The man says&quot;We&apos;re going to go see the Vatican and hope to see the
Pope.&quot;

&quot;HA! That&apos;s rich!&quot;laughs Joe.&quot;You and a million other people trying to
see him. He&apos;ll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on THIS trip.
You&apos;re going to need it!&quot;

A month later, the man comes in for his regular haircut. Joe says,
&quot;Well, how did that trip to Rome turn out? Betcha TWA gave you the worst
flight of your life!&quot;

&quot;No, quite the opposite&quot;explained the man.&quot;Not only were we on time in
one of their brand new planes, but it was full and they bumped us up to
first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28
year old flight attendant who waited on me hand and foot!&quot;

&quot;Hmmm,&quot;Joe says,&quot;Well, I bet the hotel was just like I described.&quot;

&quot;No, quite the opposite! They&apos;d just finished a $25 million remodeling.
It&apos;s the finest hotel in Rome, now. They were overbooked, so they
apologized and gave us the Presidential suite for no extra charge!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot;Joe mumbles,&quot;I KNOW you didn&apos;t get to see the Pope!&quot;

&quot;Actually, we were quite lucky. As we toured the Vatican, a Swiss guard
tapped me on the shoulder and explained the Pope likes to personally
meet some of the visitors, and if I&apos;d be so kind as to step into this
private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough,
after 5 minutes the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand. I
knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.&quot;

Impressed, Joe asks,&quot;Tell me, please! What&apos;d he say?&quot;

&quot;Oh, not much really. Just&quot;Where&apos;d you get that awful haircut?&quot;

An 85 year old man marries a lovely 25 year old woman. Because her
new husband is so old the woman decides that on their wedding night
they should have separate suites.

She is concerned that the old fellow could overexert himself.
After the festivities she prepares herself for bed and for the
knock on the door she is expecting.

Sure enough the knock comes and there is her groom ready for
action. They unite in conjugal union and all goes well whereupon
he takes his leave of her and she prepares to go to sleep for the night.

After a few minutes there&apos;s a knock on the door and there the
old guy is again ready for more action. Somewhat surprised she
consents to further coupling which is again successful after
which the octogenarian bids her a fond good night and leaves.

She is certainly ready for slumber at this point and is close
to sleep for the second time when there is another knock at the
door and there he is again fresh as a 25 year old and ready for more.

Once again they do the horizontal boogie. As they&apos;re laying in
afterglow the young bride says to him,&quot;I am really impressed
that a guy your age has enough juice to go for it three times.
I&apos;ve been with guys less than half your age who were only good
for one.&quot;

The old guy looks puzzled and turns to her and says,
&quot;Was I already here?&quot;

SILENT EXPLOSION

This dude goes to see the doctor and told him,&quot;Hey Doc, I&apos;m
having this problem with gas, but it really doesn&apos;t bother me too
much. They never smell and are always silent. As a matter of
fact, I&apos;ve farted at least 20 times since I&apos;ve been here in your
office. You didn&apos;t know I was farting because they don&apos;t smell
and they&apos;re silent.&quot;

The doctor says,&quot;I see. Well, take these pills and come back to
see me next week.&quot;

The next week the dude goes back.

&quot;Doc,&quot;he says,&quot;I don&apos;t know what you gave me, but
now my farts are still silent, but they stink terribly.&quot;

The doctor says,&quot;Very good!! Now that we&apos;ve cleared up your
sinuses, let&apos;s work on your hearing.&quot;

Three women were about to be executed by firing squad. One was a
brunette, one a redhead, and the other a blonde. The guard brought the
brunette forward and the executioner asked if she had any last
requests.

She said no and the executioner shouted.....Ready.....Aim...!! and
suddenly the brunette yelled,&quot;EARTHQUAKE!&quot;Everyone was startled and
looked around. She escaped.

So they brought up the redhead and asked if she had any last requests.
She said no, and the executioner shouted....Ready...Aim....!! and
suddenly the redhead yelled.....&quot;TORNADO!&quot;Everyone was startled and
looked around. She escaped.

Well, by now, the blonde had it all figured out. They brought her
forward and the executioner asked if she had any last requests. She
said no and the executioner shouted......Ready....Aim...!! and the blonde
yelled,&quot;FIRE!&quot;

Two guys were carpooling home from work one day. Traffic was crawling
along and they were both a bit bored. The driver was looking around and
suddenly pointed at two dogs having sex in someone&apos;s front lawn.

&quot;Look,&quot;he shouted,&quot;What are the those dogs doing? Fighting?&quot;

The passenger, being a man of the world, replied,&quot;They&apos;re having sex.
Don&apos;t tell me that you have never had sex doggie style before.&quot;The
driver, a bit embarrassed, admitted that he never had. His passenger
said,&quot;You have to try it. It&apos;s pretty cool. Here&apos;s what you do.
Tonight when you get home, fix your wife a margarita and then suggest
that you want to try this new sexual position.&quot;The driver thought a
bit, then decided he would give it a try. The next morning, the two
commuters were back in the car and the passenger asked,&quot;Well. How did
it go?&quot;The driver replied,&quot;It was GREAT! But it took me SIX
margaritas just to get her naked in the front lawn!&quot;

Old man sitting on his front porch down in Louisiana at 0600
watching the sun rise sees the neighbor&apos;s kid walk by carrying
something big under his arm.

He yells out&quot;Hey boy, whatcha got there?&quot;
Boy yells back&quot;Roll of chicken wire.&quot;
Old man says&quot;What you gonna do with that?&quot;
Boy says&quot;Catch some chickens.&quot;
Old man yells&quot;You damn fool, you can&apos;t catch
chickens with chicken wire!&quot;
Boy just laughs and keeps walking.

That evening at sunset the boy comes walking by and to the old
man&apos;s surprise he is dragging behind him the chicken wire with
about 30 chickens caught in it.

Same time next morning the old man is out watching the sun rise
and he sees the boy walk by carrying something kind of round in his
hand.
Old man yells out&quot;Hey boy, whatcha got there?&quot;
Boy yells back&quot;Roll of duck tape.&quot;
Old man says&quot;What you gonna do with that?&quot;
Boy says back&quot;Catch me some ducks.&quot;
Old man yells back,&quot;You damn fool, you can&apos;t catch ducks with
duck tape!&quot;
Boy just laughs and keeps walking.

That night around sunset the boy walks by coming home and to the
old man&apos;s amazement he is trailing behind him the unrolled roll of
duck tape with about 35 ducks caught in it.

Same time next morning the old man sees the boy walking by carrying
what looks like a long reed with something fuzzy on the end.

Old man says&quot;Hey boy, whatcha got there?&quot;
Boy says&quot;It&apos;s a pussy willow.&quot;
Old man says&quot;Hold on, I&apos;ll get my hat.&quot;

A tourist walked into a pet shop and was looking at the animals on
display. While he was there another customer walked in and said to the
shopkeeper&quot;I&apos;ll have a C monkey please&quot;.

The shopkeeper nodded, went over to a cage at the side of the shop, and
took out a monkey.He fit a collar and leash and handed it to the
customer, saying&quot;That&apos;ll be $5000&quot;. The customer paid and walked out
with his monkey.

Startled, the tourist went over to the shopkeeper and said,&quot;That was a
very expensive monkey most of them are only a few hundred dollars. Why
did it cost so much?&quot;

The shopkeeper answered,&quot;Ah, that monkey can program in C - very fast,
tight code, no bugs, well worth the money.&quot;

The tourist looked at the monkey in another cage.&quot;That one&apos;s even more
expensive - $10,000! What does it do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that one&apos;s a C++ monkey;it can manage object-oriented programming,
Visual C++, even some Java. All the really useful stuff,&quot;said the
shopkeeper.

The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey in
a cage of its own.The price tag around its neck read $50,000. He gasped
to the shopkeeper,&quot;That one costs more than all the others put
together! What on earth does it do?&quot;

The shopkeeper replied,&quot;Well, I haven&apos;t actually seen it do anything,
but it says it&apos;s a consultant.&quot;

A woman could never get her husband to do anything around the house. He
would come home from work, sit in front of the tv, eat dinner, and sit

some more--would never do those little household repairs that most
husbands

take care of. This frustrated the woman quite a bit.

One day the toilet stopped up. When her husband got home, she said
sweetly,&quot;Honey, the toilet is clogged. Would you look at it?&quot;Her husband
snarled&quot;What do I look like? The tidy-bowl man?&quot;and sat down on the
sofa.

The next day, the washing machine was on the blink. When her husband got
home, she sat down on the sofa. She said very nicely to him&quot;Honey the
washer isn&apos;t running. Would you check on it?&quot;and once again he growled,
What do you think I Look like? The Maytag repairman?

The next day, the garbage disposal wouldn&apos;t work. Would you try to fix it
for me? Once again he growled,&quot;What do I look like? Mr. Plumber?

Finally she had had enough! The next morning, the woman called three
repairmen to fix the toilet, the garbage disposal, and the washer. When
her husband got home, she said,&quot;Honey, I had the repairmen out today.&quot;
He frowned,&quot;Well how much is that going to cost?&quot;

&quot;Well, honey, they all said I could pay them by baking them a cake or
having sex with them.&quot;&quot;Well, what kind of cake did you bake for them?&quot;
he asked. She smiled.&quot;What do I look like? Betty Crocker?&quot;

A guy walks into a bar and sits down. He starts dialing numbers... like
a telephone... on his hand and talking into his hand. The bartender
walks over and tells him this is a very tough neighborhood and he
doesn&apos;t need any trouble here.

The guy says,&quot;You don&apos;t understand. I&apos;m very hi-tech. I had a phone
installed in my hand because I was tired of carrying the cellular.&quot;The
bartender says&quot;Prove it.&quot;

The guy dials up a number and hands his hand to the bartender. The
bartender talks into the hand and carries on a conversation.&quot;That&apos;s
incredible,&quot;says the bartender.&quot;I would never have believed it!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot;said the guy,&quot;I can keep in touch with my broker, my wife, you
name it. By the way, where is the men&apos;s room?&quot;The bartender directs him
to the men&apos;s room. The guy goes in and 5, 10, 20 minutes go by and he
doesn&apos;t return.

Fearing the worst given the neighborhood, the bartender goes into the
men&apos;s room. There is the guy spread-eagle on the wall. His pants are
pulled down and he has a roll of toilet paper up his butt.&quot;Oh my god!&quot;
said the bartender.&quot;Did they rob you? Are you hurt?&quot;The guy turns and
says:&quot;No, I&apos;m ok. I&apos;m just waiting for a fax.&quot;

This is such a good lesson in itself and almost too funny for words. I
hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, thanks to Charlie Waldron.

Having her hair done at a West Hempstead, NY, beauty parlor, a Woman
told a cautionary tale about racial prejudice. The story deserves a
wider audience. On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, the woman
related, she won a bucketful of quarters at a slot machine. She took a
break from the slots for dinner with her husband in the hotel dining
room. But first she would stash the quarters in her room. I&apos;ll be
right back and we&apos;ll go to eat,&quot;she told her husband and she carried
the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. As she was about to walk into
the elevator she noticed two men already aboard. Both were black. One
of them was big... Very big... An intimidating figure.

The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob me.
Her next thought was: Don&apos;t be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice
gentlemen, even if one of them is awfully black. But racial stereotypes
are powerful, and fear immobilized her.

She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered,
ashamed. She hoped they didn&apos;t read her mind but knew they surely did;
her hesitation about joining them on the elevator was all too obvious.
Her face burned. She couldn&apos;t just stand there, so with a mighty effort
of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed with the
other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second
passed, and then another second, and then another. The elevator didn&apos;t
move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I&apos;m trapped and about
to be robbed!

Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. Then one of
the men said,&quot;Hit the floor.&quot;Instinct told her: Do what they tell
you. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and
collapsed on the elevator carpet.

A shower of coins rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she
prayed. More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say politely,
&quot;Ma&apos;am, if you&apos;ll just tell us what floor you&apos;re going to, we&apos;ll push
the button.&quot;The one who said it had a little trouble getting the words
out. He was trying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. She lifted her
head and looked up at the two men.

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet.

&quot;When I told my man here to hit the floor,&quot;one of the men, the average
sized one, told her,&quot;I meant that he should hit the elevator button for
our floor. I didn&apos;t mean for you to hit the floor, ma&apos;am.

He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was having a hard
time not laughing.

She thought: My God, what a spectacle I&apos;ve made of myself. She was too
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words
failed her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen
for behaving as though they were robbing you? She didn&apos;t know. The 3
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. When
the elevator arrived at her floor they insisted on walking her to her
room.

She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she might
not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her good evening.

As she slipped into her room she could hear them laughing while they
walked back to the elevator.

The woman brushed herself off. She pulled herself together and went
downstairs for dinner with her husband.

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room ~ a dozen roses.
Attached to each rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. A card said:
&quot;Thanks for the best laugh we&apos;ve had in years.&quot;It was signed,


Eddie Murphy and Bodyguard.

A lecturer teaching medicine was tutoring a class on &apos;Observation&apos;. He
took out a jar of yellow-colored liquid.&quot;This&quot;, he explained,&quot;is
urine. To be a doctor, you have to be observant to color, smell, sight,
and taste.&quot;

After saying this, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it into his
mouth. His class watched on in amazement, most, in disgust. But being
the good students that they were, the jar was passed, and one by one,
they dipped one finger into the jar and then put it into their mouth.

After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head.&quot;If any
of you had been observant, you would have noticed that I put my 2nd
finger into the jar and my 3rd finger into my mouth.&quot;

 REASONS WHY ALCOHOL SHOULD BE SERVED AT WORK... It&apos;s an incentive to show up. It reduces stress. It leads to more honest communications. It reduces complaints about low pay. It cuts down on time off because you can work with a 

hangover.
6. Employees tell management what they think, not what
management wants to hear.

 It helps save on heating costs in the winter. It encourages carpooling. Increase job satisfaction because if you have a bad job, 

you don&apos;t care.
10. It eliminates vacations because people would rather
come to work.

 It makes fellow employees look better. It makes the cafeteria food taste better. Bosses are more likely to hand out raises when they 

are wasted.

 Salary negotiations are a lot more profitable. Suddenly, burping during a meeting isn&apos;t so 

embarrassing.
16. Employees work later since there&apos;s no longer a need
to relax at the bar.

 It makes everyone more open with their ideas. Everyone agrees the work is better after they&apos;ve had a 

couple of drinks.
19. Eliminates the need for employees to get drunk on
their lunch break.

 Increases the chance of seeing your boss naked. It promotes foreign relations with the former Soviet 

Union.

 The janitor&apos;s closet will finally have a use. Employees no longer need coffee to sober up. Sitting on the copy machine will no longer be seen as 


&quot;gross,&quot;
25. Babbling and mumbling incoherently will be common
language.

Haven&apos;t we all wanted to do this at one time or another?? LOL
One thing that has always bugged me, and I&apos;m sure it does most of
you, is to sit down at the dinner table only to be interrupted by a phone
call from a telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as
irritating as they were to me. The call was from AT&amp;T;and it went
something like this: (swallowing)

Me: Hello

AT&amp;T;: Hello, this is AT&amp;T...;

Me: Is this AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Yes, this is AT&amp;T...;

Me: This is AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Yes This is AT&amp;T...;

Me: Is this AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: YES! This is AT&amp;T;, may I speak to Mr. Byron please?

Me: May I ask who is calling?

AT&amp;T;: This is AT&amp;T.;

Me: OK, hold on.

At this point I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking
that, surely, this person would have hung up the phone. I ate my salad.
Much to my surprise, when I picked up the receiver, they were still waiting.

Me: Hello?

AT&amp;T;: Is this Mr. Byron?

Me: May I ask who is calling please?

AT&amp;T;: Yes this is AT&amp;T...;

Me: Is this AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Yes this is AT&amp;T...;

Me: This is AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Yes, is this Mr. Byron?

Me: Yes, is this AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Yes sir.

Me: The phone company?

AT&amp;T;: Yes sir.

Me: I thought you said this was AT&amp;T.;

AT&amp;T;: Yes sir, we are a phone company.

Me: I already have a phone.

AT&amp;T;: We aren&apos;t selling phones today Mr. Byron.

Me: Well whatever it is, I&apos;m really not interested but thanks for
calling.

(When you are not interested in something, I don&apos;t think you can
express yourself any plainer than by saying&quot;I&apos;m really not interested&quot;, but
this lady was persistent.)

AT&amp;T;: Mr. Byron we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Now, I am sure she meant she was offering a&quot;rate&quot;of 10 cents a minute but she at no time used the word rate. I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering.

Me: Now, that&apos;s 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day?

AT&amp;T;: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes sir
that&apos;s right! 24 hours a day!

Me: 7 days a week?

AT&amp;T;: That&apos;s right.

Me: 365 days a year?

AT&amp;T;: Yes sir.

Me: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!!! That&apos;s amazing!

AT&amp;T;: We think so!

Me: That&apos;s quite a sum of money!

AT&amp;T;: Yes sir, it&apos;s amazing how it adds up.

Me: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one
at the end of the year for the full $52,560, and if you send an annual
check, can I get a cash advance?

AT&amp;T;: Excuse me?

Me: You know, the 10 cents a minute.

AT&amp;T;: What are you talking about?

Me: You said you&apos;d give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1,008 per week and
$52,560 per year. I&apos;m just interested in knowing how you will be making
payment.

AT&amp;T;: Oh no sir I didn&apos;t mean we&apos;d be paying you. You pay us 10 cents
a minute.

Me: Wait a minute here!!! Didn&apos;t you say you&apos;d give me 10 cents a
minute. Are you sure this is AT&amp;T;?

AT&amp;T;: Well, yes this is AT&amp;T;sir but......

Me: But nothing, how do you figure that by saying that you&apos;ll give me
10 cents a minute that I&apos;ll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some
kind of subliminal telemarketing scheme? I&apos;ve read about things like this in
the Enquirer you know. Don&apos;t use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.

AT&amp;T;: No sir we are offering 10 cents a minute for.....

Me: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please!

AT&amp;T;: Sir I don&apos;t think that is necessary.

Me: Sure! You say that now! What happens later?

AT&amp;T;: What?

Me: I insist on speaking to a supervisor!

AT&amp;T;: Yes Mr. Byron. Please hold.

So now AT&amp;T;has me on hold and my supper is getting cold. I begin to
eat while I&apos;m waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and
while I have a mouth full of food:

Supervisor: Mr. Byron?

Me: Yeth?

Supervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents
a minute program.

Me: Id thish Ath Teeth&amp;Teeth?

Supervisor: Yes sir, it sure is.
I had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to
suppress my laughter and I had to be careful not to produce a snort.

Me: No, actually I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so
that I could sign up for the plan.

Supervisor: OK, no problem, I&apos;ll transfer you back to the person who
was helping you.

Me: Thank you.

I was on hold once again and managed a few more mouthfuls. I needed
to end this conversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite
voice at the other end of the phone.

AT&amp;T;: Hello Mr. Byron, I understand that you are interested in signing
up for our plan?

Me: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never
have enough friends and I&apos;m an only child and I&apos;d really like to have a
little brother...

Jerry is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood
and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him
how he was doing, he would reply,&quot;If I were any better, I would be
twins!&quot;He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had
followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the
waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural
motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling
the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.

Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry
and asked him, I don&apos;t get it! You can&apos;t be a positive person all of
the time. How do you do it?&quot;Jerry replied,&quot;Each morning I wake up
and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to
be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood. I choose to be
in a good mood.

Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can
choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone
comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I
can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of
life.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right, it&apos;s not that easy,&quot;I protested.&quot;Yes it is,&quot;Jerry
said.&quot;Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk,
every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations.
You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good
mood or bad mood.

The bottom line: It&apos;s your choice how you live life.&quot;I reflected on
what Jerry said.

Soon thereafter, I left the restaurant industry to start my own
business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a
choice about life instead of reacting to it. Several years later, I
heard that Jerry did something you are never supposed to do in a
restaurant business: he left the back door open one morning and was
held up at gunpoint by three armed robbers. While trying to open the
safe, his hand, shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination.
The robbers panicked and shot him.

Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local
trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care,
Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still
in his body. I saw Jerry about six months after the incident. When I
asked him how he was, he replied,&quot;If I were any better, I&apos;d be twins.
Wanna see my scars?&quot;

I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his
mind as the robbery took place.&quot;the first thing that went through my
mind was that I should have locked the back door,&quot;Jerry replied.
&quot;Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I
could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live.&quot;
&quot;Weren&apos;t you scared? Did you lose consciousness?&quot;I asked. Jerry
continued,&quot;...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was
going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the
expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared.

In their eyes, I read &apos;he&apos;s a dead man&quot;I knew I needed to take action.&quot;

What did you do?&quot;I asked.&quot;Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting
questions at me,&quot;said Jerry.&quot;She asked if I was allergic to anything.

&apos;Yes&apos; I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited
for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled,&quot;Bullets!&quot;Over their
laughter, I told them,&quot;I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am
alive, not dead.&quot;Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but
also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day
we have the choice to live fully. Attitude, after all, is everything.

Try holding those brats...with their pants full of piss
They pull on my nose - they grab at my beard
And if I don&apos;t smile..the parents think I&apos;m weird
Flying through the air...dodging the trees
Falling down chimneys and skinning my knees
I&apos;m quitting this job...there&apos;s just no enjoyment
I&apos;ll sit on my fat ass and draw unemployment
There&apos;s no Christmas this year...now you know the reason
I found me a blonde.. I&apos;m going SOUTH for the season!!

Edna and Bill were two residents of a nursing home who had been carrying
on a love affair. They were both 96 years old, and wheelchair bound.
Every night, they would meet in the TV room. Edna would passively hold
Bill&apos;s penis and they would watch TV for an hour or so. It wasn&apos;t much,
but it was all they had. One night Bill didn&apos;t show up. He didn&apos;t show
up for the next two nights either. Edna assumed he was dead, but then
she saw him happily wheeling about the grounds.

She confronted him and said&quot;Where were you these past couple of
nights?&quot;

He replied&quot;If you must know, I was with another woman&quot;.

&quot;Bastard!&quot;she cried.&quot;What were you doing?&quot;.

&quot;We do the exact same thing that you and I do,&quot;he answered.

&quot;Is she prettier or younger than I am?&quot;she asked.

&quot;Nope; she looks the same, and she is 98 years old,&quot;Bill replied.

&quot;Well then, what does she have that I don&apos;t?&quot;Edna asked.

Bill smiled slyly and said&quot;Parkinson&apos;s disease&quot;.

....And God created woman and she had 3 breasts.
He then asked the woman,&quot;Is there anything you&apos;d like to have
changed?&quot;

She replied,&quot;Yes, could you get rid of this middle breast?&quot;
And so it was done, and it was good.

Then the woman exclaimed as she was holding that third breast in her
hand,&quot;What can be done with this useless boob?&quot;

And God created man.

*******************************************************************

I saw you across a crowded room.
Among all the others that were there,
The lights seemed to shine down on you alone.
I knew then I had to have you for my own.

Willingly, you came with me to my home.
From the car, I carried you through the door.

Looking at you, I admire your body,
your well-shaped legs,and breasts.
Slowly I remove what wraps
around your body so tighly,
fitting you like a glove.
Exposing your tender white skin.

From your neck I remove your charms,
and carry you off in my arms,
to the warm water that awaits.

The water cascades down your neck,
flowing over your soft breasts, then,
making your legs glisten with wetness.
Droplets of water cover your taut skin.

My hands rub your body, ummmm
running them through the beads of water.
Making them trickle down off your body.

I place my fingers inside you.
You are warm and moist, so ready.
I carry your still dripping body,
to a laying place, so that I can
put inside you what was well
prepared to enter you before
we even came through the door.

As soon as I lay you down
your legs spread open wide.
You are ready now and so am I.

I put a little in slowly at first,
getting a feel for how much you can take in.

I put in more, you take it willingly.
In anticipation, faster and faster
I put it in,,pushing it in deeply
as far as I can,,until I can&apos;t
put any more in, you are so tight.
With your legs wrapped tightly,
not wanting to release any of it,

I make you so hot for a very long time,
until your sweet juices escape from within.
Then I taste you, with my tongue at first,
your skin is so soft and tender.

I taste more of you with my mouth,
you are so hot and moist, you taste so good.

Your juices coating my mouth,
making me drool in anticipation
of eating you more, with every taste.

&quot;Oh yes&quot;, I say to you,

&quot;I must say Grace&quot;

&quot;Thank God for Butterball turkey.... Amen&quot;

DEAR ABBY: A couple of women moved in across the hall from me. One is
a middle-aged gym teacher and the other is a social worker in her
mid-twenties. These two women go everywhere together and I&apos;ve never
seen a man go into their apartment or come out. Do you think they could
be Lebanese?

CURIOUS
 

DEAR ABBY: I&apos;ve been married for six years and have five kids. No
twins. My husband still wants to have sex every night and sometimes in
the morning too. I told him he should get himself a hobby, and he says
that is his hobby.
 
...I have a man I never could trust. Why, he cheats so much I&apos;m not
even sure this baby I&apos;m carrying is his.

 

...I am a twenty-three-year-old liberated woman who has been on the
pill for two years. It&apos;s getting expensive and I think my boyfriend
should share half the cost, but I don&apos;t know him well enough to discuss
money with him.
 

...I suspected that my husband had been fooling around, and when I
confronted him with the evidence he denied everything and said it would

never happen again.
 

...Will you please rush me the name of a reliable illegitimate doctor?
 

...Our son writes that he is taking Judo. Why would a boy who was
raised in a good Christian home turn against his own?
 

...I joined the Navy to see the world. I&apos;ve seen it. Now how do I get
out?
 

...My forty-year-old son has been paying a psychiatrist $50 an hour
every week for two-and-a-half years. He must be crazy.
 

...I was married to Bill for three months and I didn&apos;t know he drank
until one night he came home sober.
 

...Do you think it would be all right if I gave my doctor a little
gift? I tried for years to get pregnant and couldn&apos;t and he finally did
it.
 

My mother is mean and short-tempered. I think she is going through her
mental pause.
 

I met this nice guy who was in the service. He&apos;s the chief petting
officer.
 

... Then you told some woman whose husband had lost all interest in sex

to send him to a doctor. Well, my husband lost all interest in sex years

ago and he is a doctor.
 

...This is the second marriage for both of us. And when my husband said

&quot;I will&quot;he knew damn well he couldn&apos;t.
 

DEAR ABBY: I&apos;ve been going steady with this man for six years. We see
each other every night. He says he loves me, and I know I love him, but
he never mentions marriage. Do you think he&apos;s going out with me just for

what he can get?

GERTIE

DEAR GERTIE: I don&apos;t know. What&apos;s he getting?
 

DEAR ABBY: My husband hates to spend money! I cut my own hair and make
my own clothes, and I have to account for every nickel I spend.
Meanwhile he has a stock of savings bonds put away that would choke a
cow. How do I get some money out of him before we are both called to our

final judgment? He says he&apos;s saving for a rainy day.

FORTY YEARS HITCHED

DEAR HITCHED: Tell him it&apos;s raining!
 

DEAR ABBY: My boyfriend is going to be twenty years old next month. I&apos;d

like to give him something nice for his birthday. What do you think
he&apos;d like?

CAROL

DEAR CAROL: Never mind what he&apos;d like. Give him a tie.
 

DEAR ABBY: Are birth control pills deductible?

KAY

DEAR KAY: Only if they don&apos;t work.
 

DEAR ABBY: Our son was married in January. Five months later his wife
had a ten-pound baby girl. They said the baby was premature. Tell me,
can a baby this big be that early?

WONDERING

DEAR WONDERING: The baby was on time, the wedding was late. Forget it.
 

DEAR ABBY: Do you think about dying much?

CURIOUS

DEAR CURIOUS: No, it&apos;s the last thing I want to do.
 

DEAR ABBY: Is it possible for a man to be in love with two women at the

same time?

JAKE

DEAR JAKE: Yes, and also hazardous.
 

DEAR ABBY: I know boys will be boys, but my &apos;boy&apos; is seventy-three and
he&apos;s still chasing women. Any suggestions?

ANNIE

DEAR ANNIE: Don&apos;t worry. My dog has been chasing cars for years, but if

he ever caught one, he wouldn&apos;t know what to do with it.
 

DEAR ABBY: I have always wanted to have my family history traced, but I

can&apos;t afford to spend a lot of money to do it. Any suggestions?

SAM IN CAL.

DEAR SAM: Yes. Run for public office.
 

DEAR ABBY: What inspires you most to write?

TED

DEAR TED: The Bureau of Internal Revenue.
 

DEAR ABBY: When you are being introduced, is it all right to say,&quot;I&apos;ve

heard a lot about you&quot;?

RITA

DEAR RITA: It depends on what you&apos;ve heard.
 

DEAR ABBY: I am forty-four years old and I would like to meet a man my
age with no bad habits.

ROSE

DEAR ROSE: So would I.
 

DEAR ABBY: What&apos;s the difference between a wife and a mistress?

BESS

DEAR BESS: Night and day.

The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He&apos;s met by the
reception committee, and after a whirlwind tour he is told that
he can enjoy any of the myriad of recreations available. He decides that
he wants to read all of the ancient original text of the Holy
Scriptures, so he spends the next eon or so learning the languages.

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library
and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back
from the most recent&quot;Easy Reading&quot;to the original script. All of a
sudden there is a scream in the library. The Angels come running in only
to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself, and muttering,
&quot;An&apos;R&apos;! The scribes left out the &apos;R&apos;.&quot;

A particularly concerned Angel takes him aside, offering comfort
and asks him what the problem is and what does he mean. After collecting
his wits, the Pope sobs again,&quot;It&apos;s the letter &apos;R&apos;. They left out the
&apos;R&apos;. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!&quot;


*****************************************************************

A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in San
Francisco&apos;s Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he
discovers a detailed, life-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The
sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the
shop owner what it costs.&quot;Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,&quot;says the
shop owner,&quot;and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it.&quot;

&quot;You can keep the story, old man,&quot;he replies,&quot;but I&apos;ll take the rat.&quot;

The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with
the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the
store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind
him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but
every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow
him. By the time he&apos;s walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at
his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster,
and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers,
basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at
his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he
panics and starts to run full tilt.

No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing
hideously, now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he
comes rushing up to the water&apos;s edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks
long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post,
grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San
Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his
legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the
seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where
they drown.

Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique
shop.&quot;Ah, so you&apos;ve come back for the rest of the story,&quot;says the
owner.

&quot;No,&quot;says the tourist,&quot;I was wondering if you have a bronze lawyer.&quot;

Morris walks into an insurance office and asks for a job.

&quot;We don&apos;t need anyone,&quot;they replied.

&quot;You can&apos;t afford not to hire me. I can sell anyone, anytime, anything.&quot;

&quot;Well we have two prospects that no one has been able to sell. If you
can sell just one, you have a job.&quot;

He was gone about two hours, and returned and handed them two checks -
one for $25,000.00 and another for $50,000.00.

&quot;How in the world did you do that?&quot;they asked.

&quot;I told you I&apos;m the worlds best salesman. I can sell anyone, anywhere,
anytime!&quot;

&quot;Did you get a urine sample?&quot;they asked him.

&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;he asked.

&quot;Well, if you sell a policy over $20,000.00 the company requires a urine
sample. Take these two bottles and go back and get urine samples.&quot;

Morris was gone about six hours and they were fixing to close when in he
walks in with two five gallon buckets, one in each hand. He sets the
buckets down, and reaches in his shirt pocket and produces two bottles
of urine, and sets them on the desk and says,&quot;Here&apos;s Mr. Brown&apos;s and
this one is Mr. Smith&apos;s.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot;they said,&quot;but what&apos;s in those two buckets?&quot;

&quot;Well, I passed by the Holiday Inn and they were having a State
Teacher&apos;s Convention, so I stopped and sold them a group policy!&quot;

One day, shortly before Christmas, a man was shopping for a gift for his
children, and went into a pet store. The owner showed the man the usual
array of pets, puppies, kittens, hamsters, etc., but the man said he was
looking for something a little more unique.

The owner said,&quot;I might have what you are looking for!&quot;, and took the
man into the back room, where a bedraggled looking parrot sat on a
perch.&quot;This is Chet. He is a perfect Christmas pet, because he sings
Christmas songs.&quot;

The owner took a Bic lighter out of his pocket, lit it, and held it
under Chet&apos;s right wing just far enough away to keep from singhing the
parrot&apos;s feathers. Immediately Chet began to sing,&quot;Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way.&quot;Then the owner held the lighter
under Chet&apos;s left wing, and the squawky sound of&quot;Silent night. Holy
night&quot;poured out of Chet&apos;s beak.

The man bought the parrot on the spot, and took him home. His children
were gone when he got home, so he decided to check out Chet&apos;s talent for
himself, just to make sure he hadn&apos;t been tricked. He lit a match, held
it under Chet&apos;s right wing, and sure enough the bird began singing
&quot;Jingle bells.&quot;, just like before. Moving the match under Chet&apos;s left
wing produced the same results as in the pet store.&quot;Silent Night.&quot;
Being of a curious nature, the man decided to hold the match between
Chet&apos;s legs to see what would happen. Immediately the parrot began to
sing,&quot;Chet&apos;s nuts roasting on an open fire.&quot;

An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were amazed by
almost everything they saw, especially by two shiny, silvery walls that
could move apart and back together again. The boy asked his father,
&quot;What is this, father?&quot;

The father (never having seen an elevator) responded,&quot;Son, I have never
seen anything like this before in my life, I don&apos;t know what this is.&quot;

While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a
wheel chair rolled up to the shiny walls and pressed a button, the walls
opened and she wheeled herself into a box. The lights on top started
moving in a line and bells were sounding, then the lights reversed and
the walls reopened. Out stepped a beautiful young woman. the father,
not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son,&quot;Go
get your mother&quot;.

*****************************************************************

I think Santa Claus is a woman....

I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he&apos;s a she.

Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing
social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly
pull it all off!

For starters, the vast majority of men don&apos;t even think about selecting
gifts until Christmas Eve. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised
to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on
the shelves. On this count alone, I&apos;m convinced Santa is a woman.

Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up
Christmas morning to find a rotating musical Chia Pet under the tree,
still in the bag.

Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting there. First of all,
there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted and
strapped on to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate
claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen&apos;s rack would already
be on the way to the taxidermist.

Even if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he&apos;d still have transportation
problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and
clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions.

Other reasons why Santa can&apos;t possibly be a man:

How moral are you? What is your attitude to morals,
sex, and honesty? The fascinating personality test
below was written by a Sydney marriage expert who
is a qualified psychologist. It began as a dinner
party conversation gimmick, but it has been prepared
in this form for readers to test themselves. To do the
&quot;test&quot;you must give your honest opinion about
morals and honesty of the four characters in our
story of Sherwood Forest. Forget any preconceived
ideas you may about them - this is a different sort of
story from all the others.

&quot;The Sheriff of Nottingham captured Little John and
Robin Hood and imprisoned them in his maximum-
security dungeon. Maid Marion begged the Sheriff
for their release, pleading her love for Robin. The
Sheriff agreed to release them only if Maid Marion
spent the night with him. To this she agreed. The
next morning the Sheriff released his prisoners.
Robin at once demanded that Marion tell him how
she persuaded the Sheriff to let them go free.
Marion confessed the truth, and was bewildered
when Robin abused her, calling her a slut, and
saying that he never wanted to see her again. At this
Little John defended her, inviting her to leave
Sherwood with him and promising life-long
devotion. She accepted and they rode away together.&quot;

Now in terms of realistic every-day standards of
behaviour, put Robin, Marion, Little John and the
Sheriff in the order in which you consider they
showed the most morality and honesty. There is no
&quot;right&quot;answer, and the following is the
psychologist&apos;s estimate of you for each of the 24
arrangements.

Don&apos;t scroll down until you have made your list.

 


Here goes.......

ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You
find it hard to accept the permissive attitudes of
others, or to convince them of the validity of your
own standards. You are not disposed to trust people
and do not have a very happy life. (Men) To you
&quot;love&quot;involves sex and duty, rather than charity and
forgiveness. (Women) You blame men for much of
the unhappiness in your life.

ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: Your
philosophy of life is a sad hotchpotch of the
conventions of society, your own convictions and
romanticism. You are not unkind, only staid and
unimaginative. (Men) You see a woman as weak
but desirable. (Women) Your resent the arrogance
of men.

ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN:
(Men) We think you are unhappy, although you
probably will not admit it. As a ruthless
authoritarian you are as moral as it suits you and no
more. You do not apply the same rules to men as
you do to women. (Women) How worthless you
seem to think women are.

ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF: You
are a moralist with conventional ideas, which some
people would call old-fashioned. (Men) You
probably consider yourself a fair-minded man in a w
orld which falls badly below your standards. Your
inhibitions and sense of guilt are in the way of your
happiness. (Women) Unlucky in love? Perhaps you
hope for too much in a man. Be a realist, not a
romantic.

ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION: You
are conventional and puritanical. (Men) You
moralise and see women as a great conspiracy
against man, with sex as their principal weapon.
You are missing a great deal in life. (Women) Your
parents probably played a big part in the formation
of such a guilt complex as yours. Your mind is in
chains and it&apos;s time you did something to free it.

LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION: You
are not easy to assess. Basically you are ruled by an
inferiority complex and feelings of insecurity. How
do you present yourself to the world? An idealist, a
moralist, a conformist keeping up with Jones&apos;s?
(Men) Your conflicting views on sex and morality
may lead to every sort sexual problem. You have
always feared women, probably starting with your
mother. (Women) It is a shame you have not
accepted the ideal of woman as the equal (and
sometimes stronger) partner of man.

LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF: You
are fairly broadminded romantic and reasonably
contented. You value kindness greatly and try to
live by your ideals. You do not conceal from
yourself, or from others, you strong need for security,
which may be either emotional or material. (Men)
Perhaps you tend to idealise women and credit them
with virtues they don&apos;t possess. (Women) Your
experiences of men have not all been happy, perhaps
because you hope for a little too much?

LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You
are the slightly romantic realist. You respect truth,
and are broadminded and flexible. Whether you are
a man or a woman you are probably a happy person.
You like people and they can readily make friends
with you. You are not very adventurous, but this
does not bother you.

LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN: You
too, believe that morality is another word for
common-sense and suitability, and not something
which is universally valid or a religious truth. Your
feeling for security is strong, and you would rate
reliability as one of your virtues. (Men) Your
estimate of women as the inferior sex suggests that
you are a little uncertain of them. (Women) You are
more permissive about the morals of others than you
are about your own.

LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION: You
are conventional, unimaginative, and something of
a prude. It would be surprising if your love life was
a roaring success. (Man) You have an old-world
authoritarian attitude. One thing is sure you have
some sorry illusions about women. (Women) You
accept a double standard of morality in which
women are very much the&quot;second sex&quot;.

SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN:
(Man) We find it hard to imagine you leading a
full, happy life. The warmth and give-and- take of
love are not for you. Your sex life is ringed with
unreality, and you neither understand nor appreciate
women. (Women) If you really believe this is the
right order, you baffle us completely.

MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: Such
an emphatic rejection of ready-made values in
probably partly camouflage. You hate to be thought
weak or insecure. You value honesty, and abominate
humbug and hypocrisy. (Men) Women are very
much part of you life, and you are - or perhaps
would like to be - quite ruthless, both with women
and life in general. (Women) You are tolerant about
men and their failings - but we mean men, for you
have no time for boys on men&apos;s errands.

MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You
know the so- called facts of life, but not to enjoy life
itself. You are not a realist and you are inclined to
be stubborn. (Men) Women, you think, are either
whores or angels, and you over-estimate the
differences between the sexes. A woman may find
you difficult to live with. (Women) You are not
sure whether truth and morality go hand in hand or
are in opposition. You haven&apos;t a very high opinion
of men.

MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: If
you are not happy - and we suspect you are not - it
maybe because you feel guilty about your own
emotions, and lack confidence in your opinions.
(Men) No doubt you consider yourself a moral man,
and a fair one. Your fuzzy ideas about morality may
make their mark on your sex life. (Women) You are
too concerned about what others think.

MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You
are essentially a contented person, even if you
consider yourself a little superior. You are moral by
your own standards, for you believe that morality is
what best suits the occasion. (Men) You are
sexually uninhibited, more romantic than you may
appear, and more dependent on the approval of
others than you care to admit. (Women) You like
being a woman, you understand what love is, and
frankly enjoy sex.

MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF: We
would expect you to be a happy, well-balanced
person who likes people and is liked by others. You
question whether many conventional views on
morality are valid under all circumstances. (Men)
Do we detect a sense of chivalry and idealism under
the sophistication? (Women) You will expect high
standards form the men to whom you give your love.

LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF: You
are a cautious type, neutral, and rather insecure.
You would agree with the idea that everybody has
his price - and in your own case it would not be high.
(Men) You are sexually inhibited with an
underlying distrust of women. (Women) At least
one man has made you unhappy, and you are now
on your guard.

SHERRIF, ROBIN, LITLE JOHN, MARION:
Although you make a brave show of being self-
sufficient, beneath this you are unhappy and rather
mixed up. (Men) You don&apos;t understand women -
probably you are afraid of them. You do not know
what love is, and you are more likely to boast about
your conquests in a bar than prove them in a
bedroom. (Women) If men attract you at all, they
probably be disastrously the wrong sort.

SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN: If
you are not living a happy life the cause is within
yourself. You are a rebel...with a trace of spoilt child
about you. You value truth above morality, but you
are reasonably tolerant of those who disagree with
you. (Men) any problems you have are not likely to
be centred in sex. (Women) Despite your experience
and intelligence you are a bad judge of men.

SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: You
claim to be a realist or even a cynic, but you are
more emotional and romantic and truthful. (Men)
although you are by no means inhibited, your
amorous adventures are as much a matter of fantasy
as fact. (Women) You have been hurt in the past by
men - or perhaps a particular man - and will
probably let it happen again.

SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION: Not a
moralising pattern, but... (Men) You share with
many other men the idea that most women are fickle
and inferior to men. Perhaps a view that you got
from your father? Or as a reaction to a domineering
mother? (Women) You have a pretty poor opinion
of yourself, haven&apos;t you?

SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN: You
have a confused, immature sense of values. You are
erratic and stubborn, and inclined to get angry or
sulk when you don&apos;t get your own way. But at least
you are not a moral hypocrite. (Men)&quot;Love &apos;em and
leave &apos;em&quot;is the motto of a man who is basically
afraid of women. (Women) Perhaps you would
rather be a man than a women?

MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN:
Associate morality with honest and truth more than
with religious values. You are impulsive and
somewhat unpredictable. (Men) We suspect that you
are a would-be lover rather than a very successful
one. (Women) You are a realist and a revel, a
defender of women&apos;s rights. You like men but
despise weak ones.

about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling at me,&quot;You darn

couldn&apos;t recall anything about firemen in the Bible.

She jerked her Bible from behind the counter and ruffled thru some

The Ride of Her Life....

A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no
lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and the
horse immediately springs into motion.

It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins
to slip from the saddle. In terror, she grabs for the horse&apos;s mane, but
cannot seem to get a frim grip. She tries to throw her arms around the
horse&apos;s neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway.

The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to its slipping rider.
Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to
try and throw herself to safety. Unfortunately, her foot has become
entangled in the stirrup and she is now at the mercy of the horse&apos;s
pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and
again. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments
away from unconsciousness when......

&quot;Merry Friggin&apos; Christmas to all,
And yous better show some respect!&quot;

Commentary

The Yellow Brick Beltway

By David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School and an adjunct
scholar at the Cato Institute.

The release this month of&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;in a digitally juiced-up film
format should prompt more people to read the even more wonderful book.
Their reading pleasure will be enhanced by understanding that L. Frank Baum
wrote the book as parable whose point is more poignant today than when it
was published in 1900--that the wizards of Washington are a bunch of
charlatans running a scam on the little people of America.

Baum drew the book&apos;s symbolism from William Jennings Bryan&apos;s campaign for
the national government to back its paper money with silver as well as
gold. Bryan&apos;s opponent in the 1896 and 1900 presidential elections was
William McKinley, who supported the gold standard. Bryan argued that the
gold standard depressed the economy, thereby crucifying America on a&quot;cross
of gold.&quot;The hard times are represented by the bleakness of the Kansas in
which Dorothy finds herself at the beginning of the book.

Dorothy represents everywoman, and the cyclone that carries her to the land
of Oz is a silverite victory at the polls, according to the historian
Richard Jensen. The land gets its name from the silverites wanting 16
ounces (oz.) of silver to be the monetary equivalent of one ounce of gold.
Her own house lands on the wicked Witch of the East (the Eastern bankers),
killing the witch and freeing the Munchkins (ordinary people) from bondage.
The good Witch of the North (the Northern electorate) tells Dorothy that
the Wizard of Oz may be able to help her get home. To reach him, she must
travel the yellow brick road (gold ingots), which may be done only with
silver slippers (the movie changed them to ruby for better contrast). She
meets Bryan&apos;s supporters along the way--the Scarecrow (the farmer who
thinks he has no brains) and the Tin Woodsman (the industrial laborer who
thinks he has no compassion)--and Bryan himself represented as a Cowardly
Lion.

This ragtag electoral coalition gets to national capital, the Emerald City,
whose greenish hue is an optical illusion, just as the greenback dollar is
illusory money. The wizard proves to be a complete charlatan. As he
confesses to himself,&quot;How can I help being a humbug when all these people
make me do things that everybody knows can&apos;t be done? It was easy to make
the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodsman happy, because they imagined I
could do anything.&quot;He blames his actions on the polls, but at least he is
honest with himself. To get Dorothy back to Kansas, he suggests a hot air
balloon, but his hot air carries him away, leaving Dorothy behind.

The book is in the end about political and human truths of far broader
import than the elections of 1896 and 1900, both of which McKinley won. The
Scarecrow learns that he always had brains, the Woodsman that he always had
a heart, the Lion that he always had courage. Dorothy too learns that with
her silver shoes she always had the means to return home. The message is
that ordinary people can take care of themselves if they realize their full
potential, work together and do not put themselves into the thrall of
self-professed experts wielding the powers of government.

This populist message was uncongenial to E.Y. (Yip) Harburg, the socialist
and New Dealer who had the most to do with scripting the movie. The movie
makes the wizard a force for good. Although he is a fast talker and
overpromiser, he is not a complete humbug, because he instills Dorothy, her
companions and his own people with the confidence needed to succeed. He
gives them, however indirectly, what the New Deal promised to the American
people--brains, heart and courage. The wizard&apos;s farewell address was
readily identifiable to the movie audiences of 1939 as in the style of
Franklin Roosevelt.

This subtle respinning of the story turns its meaning on its head. In the
book, Dorothy seeks the security of home in the national capital, but finds
there nothing but trickery and discovers in the process that she and her
fellow citizens already have what it takes to live the good life. In the
movie, Dorothy and the rest of humanity find that they need charismatic and
expert leaders. They are bound to keep electing wizards.

The book&apos;s perspective is needed today more than ever. Our modern wizards
are far more sophisticated than the original at deceiving the people. The
original wizard simply stayed in his palace, required the wearing of tinted
glasses and promised only what might happen anyway. Our modern wizards of
both parties have tricks to avoid responsibility that Baum could not have
dreamed of. They use unfunded mandates and unfunded entitlements to give to
Peter without appearing to take from Paul. For the same reason, they
delegate to agencies and the courts the power to regulate and to tax. Their
secret is the same as the original wizard&apos;s--they have nothing to give us
that we do not already have in ourselves. Yes, we do need some government,
but, no, we don&apos;t need the aggrandizement of government that comes from all
the tricks.

Which reminds me, Dorothy, stay away from the White House.

*****************************************************************

Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson went on a camping trip. After a good
meal and a bottle of wine they lay down for the night, and went to
sleep. Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.

&quot;Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.&quot;

Watson replied,&quot;I see millions and millions of stars.&quot;

&quot;What does that tell you?&quot;Watson pondered for a minute.

&quot;Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies
and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that
Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is
approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, I can see
that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant.
Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day
tomorrow. What does it tell you?&quot;

Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke.

&quot;Watson, you idiot. Some bastard has stolen our tent.&quot;

Have you ever noticed that they put advertisements in with your bills
now? Like bills aren&apos;t distasteful enough, they have to stuff junk
mail in there with them. I get back at them. I put garbage in with my
check when I mail it in. Coffee grinds, banana peels...I write,&quot;Could
you throw this away for me? Thank you.&quot;

 
Fabric Softener:
My wife uses fabric softener. I never knew what that stuff was for.
Then I noticed women were coming up to me (sniff) &apos;Married&apos; (walk
off). That&apos;s how they mark their territory. You can take off that
ring, but it&apos;s hard to get that April fresh scent out of your
clothes.

 

Cripes
My wife&apos;s from the Midwest. Very nice people there. Very wholesome.
They use words like &apos;Cripes.&apos; For Cripe&apos;s sake. Who would that be,
Jesus Cripes? The son of &apos;Gosh?&apos; of the church of &apos;Holy Moly.&apos; I&apos;m
not making fun of it. You think I wanna burn in &apos;Heck&apos;?
 

Morning Differences:
Men and women are different in the morning. The men wake up aroused
in the morning. We can&apos;t help it. We just wake up and we want you.
And the women are thinking, &apos;How can he want me the way I look in the
morning?&apos; It&apos;s because we can&apos;t see you. We have no blood anywhere
near our optic nerve.
 

Pregnancy:
It&apos;s weird when pregnant women feel the baby kicking. They say, &apos;Oh
my god. He&apos;s kicking. Do you wanna feel it?&apos; I always feel awkward
reaching over there. Come on! It&apos;s weird to ask someone to feel your
stomach. I don&apos;t do that when I have gas.&quot;Oh my god...give me your
hand...It won&apos;t be long now...&quot;
 

Grandma:
My grandmother has a bumper sticker on her car that says, &apos;Sexy
Senior Citizen&apos;. You don&apos;t want to think of your grandmother that
way, do you? Out entering wet shawl contests. Makes you wonder where
she got that dollar she gave you for your birthday.
 
Reverse Life Cycle:
The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is
tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of
it? A death. What&apos;s that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all
backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live
in an old age home. You get kicked out when you&apos;re too young, you get
a gold watch, you go to work. You work forty years until you&apos;re young
enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, you party,
you get ready for high school. You go to grade school, you become a
kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little
baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months
floating...you finish off as a gleam.

 
Prisons:
Did you know that it costs forty thousand dollars a year to house
each prisoner? Jeez, for forty thousand bucks a piece I&apos;ll take a few
prisoners into my house (I live in Los Angeles). I already have bars
on the windows. I don&apos;t think we should give free room and board to
criminals. I think they should have to run twelve hours a day on a
treadmill and generate electricity. And if they don&apos;t want to run,
they can rest in the chair that&apos;s hooked up to the generator.

 
Award Shows:
Can you believe how many award shows they have now? They have awards
for commercials. The Cleo Awards. A whole show full of commercials. I
taped it and then I fast-forwarded through the whole thing.

 
Phone-in Polls:
You know those shows where people call in and vote on different
issues? Did you ever notice there&apos;s always like 18%&quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;.
It costs 90 cents to call up and vote...They&apos;re voting&quot;I don&apos;t
know.&quot;&quot;Honey, I feel very strongly about this. Give me the phone.
(Into phone) I DON&apos;T KNOW! (hangs up, looking proud) Sometimes you
have to stand up for what you believe you&apos;re not sure about.&quot;This
guy probably calls up phone sex girls for $2.95. (into phone)
&quot;I&apos;m not in the mood.&quot;

 

Answering Machine:
Did you ever hear one of those corny, positive messages on someone&apos;s
answering machine?&quot;Hi, It&apos;s a great day and I&apos;m out enjoying it right
now. I hope you are too. The thought for the day is &apos;Share the love.&apos;&quot;
Beep.&quot;&quot;Uh, yeah...this is the VD clinic calling...Speaking of being
positive, your test is back. Stop sharing the love.&quot;

Office Christmas Party Etiquette for those who don&apos;t know when to say
&quot;when&quot;.

10. Once your pantyhose have a big&quot;Easy Access&quot;hole hole in the upper
thigh, just take &apos;em off already. You&apos;re not fooling anyone there,
classy-chick.

9. The president of your company does NOT want to know how YOU think
things are REALLY going. Cause you know what? If anyone really
cared,YOU &apos;D be president. So just move along, smarty-pants.

8 . Eat any and all cheese products you are offered throughout the
evening. It works. I don&apos;t know why, but it does. I choose not to
look that particular gift horse in the mouth. Just stick to the cheese
and be grateful.

7. Arrive at the party assuming you are going to be put in a cab and
sent home. Translation, know your address, or at least have it written
down somewhere. And for god&apos;s sake, hang on to some cab fare.

6. Nothing says class like a woman double fisting Bud from the bottle.
(Use a cup, just this once.)

5. If your party is open bar all evening long, you&apos;ve hit BONANZA. Pace
yourself, or you&apos;ll be pissed in the morning when you realize you were
sent home in time to watch Jeopardy. If your party is open bar only for
an hour, offer to help&quot;organize&quot;so you can get there early and hoard
alcohol for yourself and your friends. If your party is cash bar only,
consider quitting now. It&apos;s only December 1--you can get a new job at a
company that will at least pick up the friggin&apos; bar tab for an hour.
Jeez-it&apos;s Christmas, tight-ass!

4. Just because you can&apos;t see others while you&apos;re hooking up with your
intern on the dance floor doesn&apos;t mean others can&apos;t see YOU.

3. If you&apos;ve fallen down more than once, and you still want to keep your
job, thanks for playing, we have some nice parting gifts for you, buh
bye. Check yourself out before someone has to check you in to the
emergency room. (Note:Stumbling is perfectly legal. Falling and hitting
the ground is not. More than once.)

2. Your body, especially your hands, do not belong anywhere within 6
inches of your boss&apos;s body. Not for any reason, period. If you find
your hands in need of something to do, get another drink for crying out
loud. Or wait till you get home, Spanky.

And my number one piece of Office Christmas Party Advice for the
Moderation Challenged is...

1. Stay a drink or two behind anyone you really don&apos;t like. Think of
the hours and hours of fun and excitement you will have talking about
what a drunken fool they were at the party the next day! (Oh...sure, I
had 1 0 g&amp;t;&apos;s, but you&apos;d think SHE&apos;D at least slow down after number
11...duh?!?!?)

Happy holidays everyone!!!

*****************************************************************

Twas the night before implementation and all through the house,
not a program was working, not even a browse.
The programmers hung by their tubes in despair,
with hopes that a miracle soon would be there.
The users were nestled all snug in their beds,
while visions of inquiries danced in their heads.
When out in the machine room there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.
And what to wondering eyes should appear,
but a super programmer (with a six-pack of beer).
His resume glowed with experience so rare,
he turned out great code with a bit-pusher&apos;s flair.
More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
and he cursed and muttered and called them by name.
On Update! On Add! On Inquiry! On Delete!
On Batch Jobs! On Closings! On Functions Complete!
His eyes were glassed over, fingers nimble and lean,
from weekends and nights in front of a screen.
A wink of his eye and a twitch of his head,
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
turning specs into code; then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger upon the&quot;ENTER&quot;key,
the system came up and worked perfectly.
The updates updated; the deletes, they deleted,
the inquiries inquired, the closings completed.
He tested each whistle, and tested each bell,
with nary a bomb, and all had gone well.
The system was finished, the tests were concluded,
the users&apos; last changes were even included.
And the user exclaimed with snarl and a taunt,
&quot;It&apos;s just what I asked for, but not what I want!&quot;

&quot;Adam gets a woman&quot;


Adam was walking around the Garden of Eden feeling very lonely, so God
asked Adam,&quot;What is wrong with you?&quot;Adam said he didn&apos;t have anyone
to talk to.

God said he was going to give him a companion and it would be a woman.He
said,&quot;This person will cook for you and wash your clothes, she will
always agree with every decision you make. She will bear you children
and never ask you to get up in the middle of the night to take care of
them.

She will not nag you, and will always be the first to admit she was
wrong when you&apos;ve had a disagreement. She will never have a headache,
and will freely give you love and compassion whenever needed.&quot;

Adam asked God,&quot;What will a woman like this cost?&quot;

God said,&quot;An arm, a leg and your left testicle.&quot;

Adam said&quot;What can I get for a just a rib?&quot;

The rest is history.

LATEST DARWIN AWARDS...
A 27 year old woman from France lost control over her car on a
highway near Marseilles and crashed into a tree seriously injuring
her co-driver and killing herself. Accidents like this occur quite
often and usually don&apos;t qualify for a Darwin Award nomination.
This accident is special because the drivers attention for the road
was distracted by her Tamagotchi which hang on the car keys and
beeped for food. Wanting to save the Tamagotchis life the French
woman ignored the road and killed herself.
 
Apparently, in Brazil, 3 people were flying in a plane at low
altitude, when another plane approached. For a lark, they decided
to&quot;moon&quot;the other plane. Somehow, in the execution of this
maneuver, they lost control of the plane and crashed. They were all
found dead with their pants around their ankles.
 
In an Inuit village, a young man was searching for a way of getting
drunk for free because he had no money to buy alcohol. So he
mixed gasoline with milk to get his buzz. After he drank it he
became ill and vomited on the fireplace in his house which in turn
ignited his vomit and burned his house down killing him and his
sister.
 
A recent suicide was found as follows: 34 yr. old white male found in
the basement of his home died of suffocation. He was approximately
6&apos; 2&quot;and 225 lb. He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black
and white saddle shoes and a woman&apos;s wig. It appeared that he was
trying to create a school girls uniform look. He was also wearing
a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a
rubber hose attached in its place. The other end of the hose was
connected to a hollow wooden piece of a bed post approximately
12 inches long and 3 inches in diameter. This bedpost was inserted
into his rear end for reasons unknown, and was the cause of his
suffocation. It was difficult to explain the circumstances of his
death to his family members.
 
A police officer in Ohio responded to a call that was made to 911.
She had no details before arriving except that someone was reporting
that his father was not breathing. Upon arrival, the officer found
this man face down on the couch, naked. When she rolled him over to
check for a pulse and to start CPR if necessary she noticed burn
marks around his genitals.
After the ambulance arrived and removed the man (who was and still
is dead) the police made a closer inspection of the couch and noticed
that the man had made a hole between the cushions. After flipping
the couch over they discovered what caused his death.
Apparently the man would put his penis between the cushions, down
into the hole and between 2 ELECTRIC SANDERS (with out the sand
paper obviously). According to the story, after he had his orgasm
the, ahem, discharge shorted out the sander electrocuting him to death.
 

AMERICAN INGENUITY...
During the heat of the space race in the 1960s, the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration realized that astronauts
would have to be able to record certain things while performing
their duties and so it needed a writing utensil capable of writing
in the zero gravity confines of its space capsules.
Of Course, a normal pen will not work since they are all gravity
fed. After considerable research and development spanning over
two years, the working zero-g Astronaut Pen was developed at
a cost of approximately $US1 Million (in 1960&apos;s dollars !!).
The initial production run was fifty pens.
The Soviet Union was faced with the same problem...but they
issued pencils.

&quot;Why a Christmas Tree Is Better Than a Woman&quot;

1. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t care how many other Christmas
trees you have had in the past.
2. Christmas trees don&apos;t get mad if you use exotic electrical
devices.
3. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t care if you have an artificial one
in the closet.

 You can feel a Christmas tree before you take it home. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t get mad if you look up underneath it. When you are done with a Christmas tree, you can throw it 

on the curb and have it hauled away.
7. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t get jealous around other Christmas
trees.

 A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t care if you watch football all day. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t get mad if you tie it up and throw it 


in the back of your pickup truck.

&quot;Why Is A Christmas Tree Better Than A Man&quot;

 A Christmas tree is always erect. Even small ones give satisfaction. A Christmas tree stays up for 12 days and nights. A Christmas tree always looks good - even with the 

lights on.

 A Christmas tree is always happy with its size. A Christmas tree has cute balls. A Christmas tree doesn&apos;t get mad if you break one of 


its balls.
8. You can throw a Christmas tree out when it&apos;s past its
&apos;sell by&apos; date.
9. You don&apos;t have to put up with a Christmas tree all year.

The letter below is to a man in Newport, VT named Scott Williams who
digs things out of his back yard and sends the stuff he finds to the
Smithsonian Institute, labeling them with scientific names, insisting
that they are actual archaeological finds. This guy really exists and
does this in his spare time!

Anyway...here&apos;s the actual response from the Smithsonian Institution.

Bear this in mind next time you think you are challenged in your duty to
respond to a difficult situation in writing.

Smithsonian Institute
Washington, DC 20078

 
 

Dear Mr. Williams:

Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled
&quot;93211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post...Hominid skull&quot;.

We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination,
and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it
represents conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston
County two million years ago.

Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a
Barbie doll, of the variety that one of our staff, who has small
children, believes to be&quot;Malibu Barbie.&quot;

It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the
analysis of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of us
who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come
to contradiction with your findings.

However, we do feel that there are a number of physical
attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off to its modern


origin:

1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are
typically fossilized bone.

2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic
centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest identified
proto-homonids.

3. The dentition pattern evident on the skull is more consistent
with the common domesticated dog than it is with the ravenous man-eating


Pliocene clams you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time.

This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing
hypotheses you have submitted in your history with this institution, but
the evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it. Without going
into too much detail, let us say that:

A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog
has chewed on.
B. Clams don&apos;t have teeth.

It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny
your request to have the specimen carbon-dated. This is partially due to
the heavy load our lab must bear in its normal operation, and partly due
to carbon-dating&apos;s notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic
record. To the best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced
prior to 1956 AD, and carbon-dating is likely to produce wildly
inaccurate results.

Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the
National Science Foundation Phylogeny Department with the concept of
assigning your specimen the scientific name Australopithecus
spiff-arino.

Speaking personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the
acceptance of your proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted down
because the species name you selected was hyphenated, and didn&apos;t really
sound like it might be Latin.

However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this
fascinating specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a
Hominid fossil, it is, yet another riveting example of the great body of
work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly.

You should know that our Director has reserved a special
shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens you have
previously submitted to the Institution and the entire staff speculates
daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at the site you
have discovered in your Newport back yard.

We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation&apos;s capital that
you proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the
Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing you
expand on your theories surrounding the trans-positating fillifitation
of ferrous ions in a structural matrix that makes the excellent juvenile


Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive
appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman
automotive crescent wrench.

Yours in Science,

Harvey Rowe Chief Curator - Antiquities

Enjoy a little Christmas message.... :-) Forwarded by someone at work.

Walt

&quot;&apos;Tis the night before Christmas,&quot;I thought with a frown.
I was stuck at the office. The network was down.
The routers were hung in the closet. All crashed.
Their tables had holes in their data. All trashed.

Remote distribution, it seems, just for fun,
Had erased DLLs Windows needed to run
On 84 desktops way down in accounting.
I sat stunned at my desk, my blood pressure mounting.

Then all of a sudden there arose such a clatter,
I saw that a server had something the matter.
There was smoke coming out of the main hard disk drive.
&quot;No problem,&quot;I thought.&quot;I&apos;m set up with RAID 5.&quot;

But I found out the system I thought was unstoppable
Had disk drives that turned out completely unswappable!
&quot;No problem,&quot;I thought.&quot;I&apos;ve tape backup to thank.&quot;
And then I discovered my backups were blank.

The UPS burped, and its lights all went out.
I started to scream! I started to shout!
But nobody heard as I vented my rage.
My gurus were all on vacation those days.

And nobody&apos;s tech support answered the phone.
I was nose deep in trouble, completely alone.
When out at reception, I heard a soft knock.
As the hands just touched midnight on my desktop clock.

&quot;What&apos;s your problem?&quot;he asked.&quot;Never mind, friend, I know.
I checked out your network five hours ago.
I did some proactive analysis, so
I knew that this time bomb was going to blow.&quot;

Who was this guy? Who did he think he was?
He was dressed in red coveralls, white beard, black gloves.
His eyes had the twinkle of technical genius.
His smile cut down personal distance between us.

He spread out his tools, and went straight to his work.
&quot;Whoever configured this network&apos;s a jerk,&quot;
He said with a :-) as he quickly rebooted,
Uploaded some software, and smoothly rerouted

The LAN to a WAN that he quickly supplied
With bandwidth at least 20 gigabits wide
That went via wireless, I think, LEO,
To tech support elves waiting at the North Pole.

&quot;Now bridging, now routing, now Ethernet hubs!&quot;
He chanted as each piece of hardware he rubbed.
&quot;Cheer up, my good friend! Lose that mindset so tragic!
Technology often looks just like some magic

To people who don&apos;t understand what we do.
Now a switch, emulation, now middleware glue!
Look at the protocols, check one or two,
Debug a bit, test a bit, presto! We&apos;re through!&quot;

My data was back! Every system checked out!
Tears of joy wet my face as I wandered about.
&quot;How can I thank you? You must be Saint Nick!&quot;
He said,&quot;Really, my friend, it&apos;s not such a great trick,

If you don&apos;t give up hope, focus on what you&apos;re doing,
And read all your issues of NETWORK COMPUTING.&quot;
And I heard him exclaim, as his reindeer were coursing,
&quot;Merry Christmas to all! And consider outsourcing!&quot;

While driving through a small Southern town I noticed a very unique
&quot;Nativity Scene&quot;. The scene showed that great skill and talent had gone
into it&apos;s construction. There was one feature that I could not
understand though. That was the three wise men were all wearing
fireman&apos;s helmets.

I was totally unable to come up with an explanation or reason for this.

As I drove on through the town I stopped at a convenience store on the
edge of town for some refreshments. As I was paying, I inquired of the
lady behind the counter about the helmets on the three wise men.

The lady exploded in a rage, yelling that&quot;You damn Yankees never do
read the Bible!&quot;I assured her that I do read the Bible and am very
familiar with it. However, I am unable to understand the fireman
helmets on the three wise men.

The lady jerked her Bible from behind the counter and ruffled thru some
pages, and finally jabbed her finger at a passage. Sticking it in my
face she said,&quot;See, it says right here,&quot;The three wise men came from
afar.&quot;

Tips to Managers from their employees.

1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00
and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is
refreshing.

 If it&apos;s really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every minutes to inquire how it&apos;s going. That helps. Or even 


better, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.

3. Always leave without telling anyone where you&apos;re going.
It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where
you are.

4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies,
don&apos;t open the door for me. I need to learn how to function
as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good
training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of
my limbs.

5. If you give me more than one job to do, don&apos;t tell me
which is the priority. I am psychic.

6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and
really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life
beyond work.

7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets
out, it could mean a promotion.

8. If you don&apos;t like my work, tell everyone. I like my name
to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.

9. If you have special instructions for a job, don&apos;t write
them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done.
No use confusing me with useful information.

10. Never introduce me to the people you&apos;re with. I have no
right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am
plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions
will identify them.

11. Be nice to me only when the job I&apos;m doing for you could
really change your life and send you straight to manager&apos;s
hell.

12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and
it&apos;s nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially
like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus
check you received for being such a good manager.

13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my
goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating
with a cost of living increase. I&apos;m not here for the money
anyway.

Remember when.......
A computer was something on TV
from a science fiction show of note
a window was something you hated to clean
And ram was the cousin of a goat

Meg was the name of my girlfriend
and gig was a job for the nights
now they all mean different things
and that really mega bytes

An application was for employment
a program was a TV show
a cursor used profanity
a keyboard was a piano

Memory was something that you lost with age
a cd was a bank account
and if you had a 3.5&quot;floppy
you hoped nobody found out

Compress was something you did to the garbage
not something you did to a file
and if you unzipped anything in public
you&apos;d be in jail for a while

Log on was adding wood to the fire
hard drive was a long trip on the road
a mouse pad was where a mouse lived
and a backup happened to your commode

Cut you did with a pocket knife
paste you did with glue
a web was a spider&apos;s home
and a virus was the flu

I guess I&apos;ll stick to my pad and paper and the memory in my head
I hear nobody&apos;s been killed in a computer crash but when it happens,
they will wish they were dead

*****************************************************************

One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God,&quot;Lord, I have a
problem!&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s the problem, Eve?&quot;

&quot;Lord, I know you&apos;ve created me and have provided this beautiful garden,
and all of these wonderful animals, and that hilarious comedy snake, but
I&apos;m just not happy.&quot;

&quot;Why is that, Eve?&quot;came the reply from above.

&quot;Lord, I am lonely. And I&apos;m sick to death of apples.&quot;

&quot;Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for
you.&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s a &apos;man&apos;, Lord?&quot;

&quot;This man will be a flawed creature, with aggressive tendencies, an
enormous ego and an inability to empathize or listen to you properly.
All in all, he&apos;ll give you a hard time. But, he&apos;ll be bigger and faster
and more muscular than you. He&apos;ll be really good at fighting and
kicking a ball about and hunting fleet-footed ruminants, and not
altogether bad in the sack.&quot;

&quot;Sounds great,&quot;says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow.

&quot;Yeah, well. He&apos;s better than a poke in the eye with a burnt stick.

But, you can have him on one condition.&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s that, Lord?&quot;

&quot;You&apos;ll have to let him believe that I made him first.&quot;

Pappy sees Elmer walking with a lantern and asks,&quot;Where ya going boy?&quot;

The son smiled and replied,&quot;I&apos;m a-going courting Peggy-Sue.&quot;

The Father said,&quot;When I went a-courtin&apos;, I didn&apos;t need me no dang
lantern.&quot;

&quot;Sure Pa, I know.&quot;the boy said.&quot;And look what you got!&quot;

*****************************************************************

The strong young man at the construction site was bragging that he could
outdo anyone in a feat of strength. He made a special case of making
fun of one of the older workmen. After several minutes, the
older worker had had enough.

&quot;Why don&apos;t you put your money where your mouth is,&quot;he said.&quot;I will
bet a week&apos;s wages that I can haul something in a wheelbarrow over to
that outbuilding that you won&apos;t be able to wheel back.&quot;

&quot;You&apos;re on, old man,&quot;the braggart replied.&quot;Let&apos;s see what you got.&quot;

The old man reached out and grabbed the wheelbarrow by the handles.

Then, nodding to the young man, he said,&quot;All right. Get in.&quot;

*****************************************************************

A very drunk man goes into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender
serves him and asks him if he would like to try the bar game of darts.
Three in the bullseye and win a prize.. Only a dollar for three darts.

The drunk agrees and throws the first dart. A bullseye!! Downs
another drink, takes aim on wobbly feet, lets go...Two bulls eyes!!!!
Two more quick drinks go down. Barely able to stand, he lets go of
the last dart.

Three bulls eyes!!!

All are astounded. No one has ever won. The bartender searches for
a prize... grabs a turtle from the bar&apos;s terrarium and presents it to
the drunk as his prize.

Three weeks pass... The drunk returns and orders more drinks, then
an nounces he would like to try the dart game again. To the total
amazement and wonderment of all the local drunks, he scores three more
bulls eyes and demands his prize.

The bartender, being a sort of drunk himself, and a bit short
of memory, doesn&apos;t know what to give, so he asks the drunk
&quot;Say, what did you win the last time?&quot;

And the drunk responds,&quot;A roast beef sandwich on a hard roll!&quot;

What&apos;s the difference between a Rottweiler
and a Jewish Mother?

Eventually, the Rottweiler lets go.

A young Jewish Man calls his mother and says,

&quot;Mom, I&apos;m bringing home a wonderful woman I want to marry.

She&apos;s a Native American and her name is Shooting Star.&quot;

&quot;How nice,&quot;says his mother.

&quot;I have an Indian name too,&quot;he says.&quot;It&apos;s Running Water&quot;and you have
to call me that from now on.&quot;

&quot;How nice,&quot;says his mother

&quot;You have to have an Indian name too, Mom.&quot;

&quot;I already do,&quot;says the mother.&quot;Just call me Sitting Shiva&quot;

*****************************************************************

A man calls his mother in Florida.&quot;Mom, how are you?&quot;

&quot;Not too good,&quot;says the mother.&quot;I&apos;ve been very weak.&quot;

The son says,&quot;Why are you so weak?&quot;

She says,&quot;Because I haven&apos;t eaten in 38 days.

The man says,&quot;That&apos;s terrible. Why haven&apos;t you eaten in 38 days?&quot;

The mother answers,&quot;Because I didn&apos;t want my mouth to be filled with
food if you should call.&quot;

*****************************************************************

speaking part.&quot;

A man was walking on the sidewalk and noticed up ahead that Little
Johnny was wearing a red fireman&apos;s hat and sitting in a red wagon. It
appeared that the wagon was being pulled very slowly by a large German
Shepherd. When he got closer to the lad, he noticed that Little Johnny
had a rope tied around the dog&apos;s testicles, which probably accounted for
why the dog was walking so gingerly.

Smiling, he spoke to the little boy,&quot;That&apos;s really a nice fire engine
you have there, son. But I&apos;ll bet the dog would pull you faster if you
tied that rope around his neck.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure&quot;Little Johnny replied,&quot;but then I wouldn&apos;t have a siren.&quot;

Sayings that should be on buttons:

 Well, this day was a total waste of makeup. Who are these kids and why are they calling me 

Mom?

 A hard-on doesn&apos;t count as personal growth. This isn&apos;t an office. It&apos;s Hell with fluorescent lighting. You! Off my planet! Therapy is expensive, poppin&apos; bubble wrap is cheap! 

You choose.
7. If I want to hear the pitter patter of little feet,
I&apos;ll put shoes on my cat.
8. The Bible was written by the same people who said
the Earth was flat.

 If only you&apos;d use your powers for good instead of evil... Suburbia: where they tear out the trees&amp;then name 

streets after them.

 Are those your eyeballs? I found them in my cleavage. I can&apos;t remember if I&apos;m the good twin or the evil one. One of us is thinking about sex... OK, it&apos;s me. I just want revenge. Is that so wrong? Not all men are annoying. Some are dead. Earth is full. Go home. It ain&apos;t the size, it&apos;s......... no, it&apos;s the size. Meandering to a different drummer. I&apos;m not tense, just terribly, terribly alert.
