 Where are the Fast Food 
Restaurants? 

 F ast 
 Foods Restaurants are all around us. Almost everywhere you look you&apos;ll 
 see a familiar sign s ymbolizing our fast food nation. You find them on 
 the corners of streets, off the side of interstates, airports, malls, 
 schools, gas stations, your local shopping center, and even 
 in hospitals. There is no way of getting around them. In 1970 
 Americans spent $6 billion on french fries alone. In the year 2000, 
Americans spent over $110 billion! More money is 
 spent o n french 
fries than on higher education, personal computers, or new cars! Looking 
at how our society has become more fast paced, it is no wonder less time is 
spent preparing meals in the home.  

 Today, eating out definitely is part of our fast 
paced lifestyle, not just a special treat as it was in years past. The average American eats out 198 times a year- nearly four times a week! 

 Fast food is mainly targeted to children. The restaurants are advertising toys to children; this will bring them in. Some fast food restaurants are the world&apos;s largest distributors of toys. A 
survey of American school children found that 96% could identify Ronald McDonald. Once the children are in the restaurant, they buy the fast food to get their 
toy. The high fat foods taste good to these youngsters, which in turn 
makes them believe that fast food is quick, easy and satisfying. Fast food 
restaurants are now making&quot;value&quot;meals for children that are increased in portion sizes. So, what happens 
when eating fast food becomes routine? Well, let&apos;s take a look at what 
we&apos;re eating. 

 

 

 What Are We Really 
Eating?
 When you decide to eat out at a fast food 
restaurant, ask for a list of nutrition facts. Most restaurants have these 
available in a brochure, or printed out on a poster. Keep in mind how many 
nutrients you&apos;re getting, and how much you really need for the whole day. French fries are often the food with the most fat on your tray. French fries at most fast food restaurants are deep fried in vegetable oil 
giving the fries their well known taste. A medium order of fries have 22 grams of fat 
and 450 calories. You can order a plain baked potato that has 0 grams of 
fat, 310 calories and vitamin C. If you&quot;super size&quot;your order of fries, 
you have just increased the amount of fat to 29 grams! A Big Mac will 
contain 32 grams of fat while a Big X&apos;tra with cheese will give you a total of 
46 grams of fat.  

 

 
 
 What Are 
 Some Concerns About Frequent Eating at Fast Food Restaurants? 
 
 Too much fat: Too much fat in the diet 
 contributes to high blood cholesterol levels. This can cause hardening of the 
 arteries, coronary heart disease and stroke. High-fat diets may also 
 contribute to a greater risk for some types of cancer, particularly cancers of 
 the breast and colon. Too much cholesterol: The American 
 Heart Association recommends eating no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol 
 per day. Too much cholesterol in the diet can lead to high blood 
 cholesterol levels. Too many calories. Many foods served 
 in fast food restaurants are high in calories. Extra calories daily will 
 increase your weight. Remember, 3500 calories equals one pound. Too many calories can lead to obesity, which can later turn into other diseases 
 such as heart attack, high blood pressure, and often diabetes. Too much sodium: Everyone needs some 
 sodium in the diet to replace routine losses. The Food and Nutrition Board of 
 the National Academy of Sciences/ National Research Council has estimated that 
 an&quot;adequate and safe&quot;intake of sodium for healthy adults is 1,100 to 3,300 
 milligrams a day, the equivalent of approximately 1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of 
 salt. Americans, on average, consume at least twice that amount -- 2,300 to 
 6,900 milligrams of sodium daily. Consuming high amounts of sodium can cause 
 high blood pressure.  
 
 
 
 Take a look at a few favorites to see what 
 we&apos;re eating: 
 Egg McMuffin = 235 mg Cholesterol 4 piece chicken McNuggets = 19 gram fat 9 piece chicken McNuggets = 26 grams of fat Quarterpounder with cheese = 30 grams of fat Big Mac = 1110 mg of Sodium* Garden salad = 120 mg of sodium! 
 
 *Most of the sodium we consume in our diet does 
 not come from the salt shaker on the table. In fact, only 1/3 of the 
 sodium we consume comes from table salt. Most sodium is found in 
 processed foods such as canned foods, frozen dinners, and most snack foods. We often eat a lot of these types of foods today because they are quick and 
 easy. Remember to read the food label next time you reach for one of 
 these foods. Look for the word&quot;Sodium&quot;on the label! 
 
 

 Let&apos;s take a look at some 
common fast food meals...

 Serving Sizes: 
 A person wishing to avoid over consumption of calories must pay attention to 
 the serving sizes. Use the Food Guide Pyramid to lead the way. Most serving sizes in the Food Guide Pyramid are specific and precise and 
 can be relied upon to deliver amounts of key nutrients in foods. For 
 example, the french fries you order are generally more than one serving, 
 contain very little nutrients and a lot of fat and calories. On 
 the other hand, you can order a plain baked potato. If you eat the whole 
 potato, it will be more than 1 serving, but has vitamin C and no fat. 
 
 
 
 
 Serving size examples: 
 Bread Group Vegetable Group Fruit Group Dairy Group Meat/Protein Group 1 slice bread cup cooked 1 whole medium 1 cup (8 oz) milk 2 eggs 1 medium muffin 1 cup raw leafy   cup canned 2 slices cheese (2oz) 2-3 oz cooked meat 4 small crackers - cup juice   cup dried 1 cups frozen yogurt 1 cup cooked beans 
 
 
 

 Choose foods for your 
body: 
 
 When making decisions on what to order, choose foods that are nutrient 
 dense. For example, soda is not a nutrient dense drink. Soda will 
 not contribute to the essential nutrients that your body needs. Milk will supply the body with protein, calcium and riboflavin (a B 
 vitamin). When you eat out check to see if milk is available. Skim 
 milk or 1% milk is your best choice. 
 What makes a food nutrient dense?   A food is nutrient dense if
the vitamin and mineral content is more than its energy or calorie content. Some examples are lean meats, beans, oranges, carrots, broccoli, whole-wheat bread, and
whole-grain breakfast cereals.   What makes a food energy dense? Energy dense foods 
 contribute more calories than they do nutrients such as chips, sodas, cookies 
 and ice cream. Remember to balance healthy nutrient dense foods with 
 energy dense foods.

 You Are the Model of Your 
Children&apos;s Eating Behavior.
 Somebody is always watching you, whether it&apos;s what you&apos;re reading, 
watching, or what you&apos;re eating. Be a good role model. Teach 
children early that eating a well balanced diet is healthy and fun. If you want to give your child a special treat try one of these fun recipes 
instead of taking them to the fast food restaurant. Not only will you be 
spending quality time together, but you&apos;ll be educating your children on how to 
create these great nutritious snacks/meals. 
 
 Peanut Butter Balls 
 1 cup nonfat dry milk
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup honey or corn syrup
1 cup uncooked oatmeal 
 Combine all ingredients in bowl, mix well. Knead by hand until blended. Shape into small balls and enjoy! 
 
 
 
 Quesodilla-Torilla with Cheese 
 1 soft flour 
 tortilla
2 Tablespoons shredded cheese 
 Place tortilla on a paper napkin. Sprinkle with shredded cheese. Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Roll or fold the tortilla. 
 
 
 
 Two Grain Muffins 
 1 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup white flour
1/3 cup corn meal
1/3 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup low fat yogurt, plain or vanilla
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted 
 Preheat oven to 350 . Combine flours, corn meal, sugar, baking soda and salt. Mix yogurt and 
 egg together in a small bowl. Stir in dry ingredients. Stir in 
 melted butter. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake at 350 for 20 to 25 minutes. 
 
 

 Keep in mind that when you 
do go to fast food restaurants, you can still make healthy choices. 

 
 
 Seven Keys to Eating 
 Healthier in Fast Food Restaurants: 
 Develop a can-do attitude-  Believe that you can have a healthy and 
 enjoyable meal when eating out. Slowly begin to change your ordering 
 habits so you can still eat out and not feel guilty. Decide to eat out-  For most of us, eating out is hardly a special 
 occasion, so we need to factor in our nutrition and health goals. Frequent eating out means more careful monitoring.  Choose the site-  Find restaurants that offer some 
 healthier options. Remember, eating in chain restaurants lets you 
 learn the menu and plan ahead, no matter where the individual fast food 
 restaurant is located. Have a game plan on your way to the restaurant-  Envision a 
 positive outcome-a healthy and enjoyable meal. Plan you order 
 accordingly and don&apos;t be a victim of hasty choices. Order for your stomach, not your eyes-  As you pursue the menu, 
 having planned ahead, watch for foods high in fat, rich and heavy sauces, 
 preparation methods such as frying, and ingredients that add fat like the&quot;special sauce&quot;. Also keep in mind the less ordered, the less eaten. Don&apos;t fall for the&quot;Super sized&quot;selection. This adds extra calories 
 and fat. Get it made to order-  Don&apos;t be afraid to ask to get something made 
 the way YOU want it. If you&apos;re request is practical-such as leaving 
 off and item, hold the mayo or&quot;special sauce&quot;, or dressing on the 
 side-restaurants are usually willing to accommodate. Know when enough is enough-  So many of us were brought up thinking we had to clean our plates. To prevent overeating, order 
 carefully and lightly, drink plenty of non caloric fluids with the meal such 
 as water or order a non fat milk.
