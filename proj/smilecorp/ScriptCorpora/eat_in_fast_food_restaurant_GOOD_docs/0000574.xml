A brief description of this property and its facilities

The Saddle Hotel and Grill is a small friendly family run business. Please dont come here looking for the Ritz as that is not what we do here we only look to offer reasonably priced food and accommodation with a homely atmosphere and good friendly service. Our rooms are not suites but are cosy and comfortable all the same and we try our very best to make your stay with us as enjoyable as it can be. Some of our rooms are bigger than other some containing BathShowers and some just showers. All rooms will be let on a first come first serve basis. We are open all year round excluding Christmas day and serve food daily from 12-2pm and 6-9pm. We have a huge selection of delicious home cooked food on offer in our cosy lounges and restaurants. Recommended by the Good pub guide and Which? guide to country pubs for excellent food and very reasonable prices too. We are also NOT a fast food restaurant so at busy times eg. weekends holidays when we are extremely busy please be prepared to wait as all our meals are cooked to order and will be served in the order they are taken. Located in the sea side village of Alnmouth in the heart of the beautiful Northumbrian countryside. Only 4 miles from the A1 and situated in an ideal location to visit all the northeast has to offer. Within a ten mile radius you will find Alnwick Castle and their famous gardens Warkworth Castle and some of the most amazing coast line in England plus so much more. We have just finished putting in a small residents car park as well to accommodate our guests situated at the back of the hotel. We are more a restaurant than a pub. As we are NOT a pub and never will be and do not really cater for this trade we just leave the people who like a drink or two to the many other actual pubs with their late licenses. Our license only allows us to serve drinks up until 11pm mondays to saturdays and 10.30 on sundays. The days are long enough as it is being a family run business.
