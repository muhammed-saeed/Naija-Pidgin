Adrenal Fatigue Diet

When the activities in your adrenal glands are diminished it may cause you to have problems getting out of bed for more then a couple hours at a time. Every time your adrenal levels go down it affects every part of your body.

Problems can occur with your fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism, you electrolyte and fluid balance, and also your cardiovascular and heart systems. Following an adrenal fatigue diet supposedly helps relieve excess stress, maintain your weight, and help regain your vitality and well-being.

What do you eat on the Adrenal Fatigue diet?

The adrenal fatigue diet applies the same rules as many other diets. Eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meats. Trying to recover from an overwhelming amount of fatigue requires a healthy diet. You want to choose fewer packaged foods with a lesser amount of ingredients, while eating mostly fresh whole foods. Try consuming green tea and using natural sweeteners.

You want to eat regular meals through out the day. When you need a snack, choose one with protein in it. Eat three small meals and three snacks. You want to include the following into your diet: ground flax seed, extra virgin organic coconut oil, fish oil, wild caught salmon, minimal-mercury albacore tuna, sprouted walnuts. Kelp, sprouts, green and black olives, peppers, spinach, celery and zucchini are also excellent choices.
