Most people&apos;s notions of what healthy portion sizes are have become distorted, a condition called “portion distortion.&quot; If you compare food portion sizes 20 years ago, you will see how “super sized” our food is circa 2011.

And dining out doesn&apos;t help this &quot;portion distortion&quot; epidemic. Most restaurant meals are enough for two people.

Over time, we become used to these portion sizes, and so do our waistlines.

In researching correct portion sizes, I came across this website from the National Institutes of Health . On it you will see how portions for various foods have become bigger over the last two decades. The site also has a serving size card that you can print off and keep with you, which would come in handy when dining out. ( Bonus tip: Dr. Kavita Ajmere, an eating disorder therapist in Chicago, recommends Portionpals&apos; &quot;translucent discs&quot; that &quot;show you the correct portion sizes for meat, chicken, fish, side dishes, and dessert.&quot; For example, place a piece of chicken on the disc. If it is larger than the rectangle for chicken, cut the piece of chicken to fit and you&apos;ll have a proper serving size.)
 

Eyeballing Portion Sizes 

For quick reference, below are tips for eyeballing portion sizes – especially helpful when you are eating out. While you might not have control over how much food they put on your plate, you do have control over how much you eat. Tip:

 Protein (fish, meats and eggs) = the palm of your hand (including thickness) or a deck of cards Cheese = four dice. If you have a slice of cheese, it should be the size of your palm Medium potato = computer mouse Medium orange or apple = tennis ball Raw vegetables = baseball Pasta; rice = tennis ball Oil for your salad = the size of the tip of your thumb 

 Other Helpful Guidelines for Portion Sizes: 

 1 cup (8 fl oz) is 2/3 of a can of soda (12 fl oz). 1 cup of food is about a large handful or two ice cream scoops. 1 tsp is the size of the tip of your pinky finger. 

 Portion Control Tips from the American Cancer Society Include: 

 When eating out: 

 Choose a regular hamburger at your favorite fast food restaurant instead of the larger burger, and save about 150 calories. Have the small fries instead of the super-sized ones and save about 300 calories. Order the small soda. It has about 150 fewer calories than the large one. Share an entrée with a friend. 

 When eating at home:
 

 Don&apos;t &quot;eat from the bag.&quot; When snacking, place a few chips, crackers or cookies in a bowl to help prevent overeating. Buy single portions of snack foods so you&apos;re not tempted by the whole bag or box. Like butter and sour cream on your baked potato? Mayonnaise and cheese on your sandwich? Cream cheese on your bagel? Use half the amount you usually do — and save even more calories by using lower-fat varieties. 

 Some of My Own Portion Control Tips Include: 

 Sometimes when I eat out, one of the first things I do is ask the waiter to put half of my order in a to-go container. Doing that at the start of the meal helps to control calories. 

 You can also divide your plate into one-half vegetables, one-quarter carbs and one-quarter protein. But be sure the plate is normal size – or even salad plate size. Actually, the plate size is a tip of its own: When eating at home, or even at a restaurant for that matter, put your food on a salad plate. 

 The Most Important Advice of All: 

When I ask weight loss experts, and even people who are a healthy weight, two things they tell me that are vital to weight loss are:

 Stop eating before you are full. It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain you are full, so if you stop early, you won’t overeat. 

 Eat slowly. Chew at least 20 times before swallowing. This helps you to eat less and also to enjoy your food, and also helps your body digest the food – less stress on your digestive system since your teeth and saliva work to break down the food. 

 If you have a weight loss tip, please share! One of the best ways to lose weight is by learning from other people. You can share your tips by e-mailing me at lisa@lisadavismedia.com or posting a comment below. If I decided to use your tip(s) in a story, I will be sure to let you know. You can follow me on Twitter @lisadavismedia.com. And also check out my Beyond the Number Project where I show how weight loss is more than a number on a scale and how age is not defined by the number on your driver’s license.
