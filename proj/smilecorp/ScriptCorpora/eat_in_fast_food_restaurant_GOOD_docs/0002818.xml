Dear Dengeos:

I love your yummy gyros that is never greasy, and when I&apos;m feeling naughty, your cheeseburger hits me in all the right places. And, please, let&apos;s not start on your banana milkshakes. If that&apos;s not enough, I&apos;ve really fallen for your quick carryout times, and, your greek salad with extra feta? It makes me swoon.

Will you go steady with me?
xoxoxo,
Daphne

It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve been back in the area. The parking lot is a great improvement to what they had before. That&apos;s a plus.

I&apos;ve always had their gyros but today had the Italian beef sandwich. I ordered 1 with hot peppers and 1 with sweet peppers.
They were not dipped. I guess you have to ask for it. The bread fell apart and the beef I&apos;ve had better elsewhere. I liked that you weren&apos;t charged extra for the peppers.  But they only gave about 1tsp. of hot peppers and literally 4 strips of sweet peppers. I guess that&apos;s why it&apos;s no charge.

I may have to come back to try it again.

Takes for fucking ever to get your food.  And the quality of the food is nothing to write home about.  I guess you could argue the price is right.  But what&apos;s right about feeling uncomfortable, or like your food is never coming.

Its one of those places where it seems like everyone behind you in the line gets their order before you.

Take it or leave it.

Great food and great atmosphere with a wonderful selection of all types of different food on the menu. I had the greek chicken and husband had the gyros plate and the gyros was the best I ever had, not greasy or hard, but perfectly juicy and tender. We also split a greek salad that was enough for the both of us.The atmosphere is real nice with wood beams lining the ceiling and interesting light fixtures that make the place real cozy. Would go back again if in the area, but this is just too far from our house to make it a regular thing.

Dengeos is one of my favorite places to eat.  I have been coming here since I was a kid.  I enjoy everything on their menu from the burgers and hot dogs to the ribs, salads,chicken and chocolate cake.  Price is great and I don&apos;t mind waiting a few minutes for my food since they prepare it fresh.  :)  The owners are super sweet and friendly.  When they are not massively busy the owners stop by and ask how your meal is.  Very thoughtful !!!

We decided to eat here because i was craving bbq chicken. It was decent, i also tried the gyros plate...pretty good. The cucumber sauce was good, and the pitas weren&apos;t too thick and doughy...i like that! It was clean, and the wait was a little longer than i wanted it to be. I would come back again.

I ate at Dengeos several times many years ago. Today, while out shopping with Mom, we decided to stop and grab a quick bite. I had not been there since they expanded the business. When we walked in, we were both amazed at how packed it was. They have lots of seating, but holy-moley there was a lot of folks chowing down.

Mom had a Greek salad and vegetable soup. The salad was quite good and ample and the soup was ok. (Mom is a soup-a-holic). I opted for the ribs. They were ok, but nothing I&apos;d order again. Mom liked them because they were fall off the bone ribs. I was not impressed with the sauce. The fries and slaw were both good.

We will be back some day soon. We both want to try a few other things on the rather extensive menu. It nicely fills the niche between fast food and fine dining.

I&apos;m still blown away by how packed it was. It obviously works for a whole lot of people.

For &quot;cheap eats&quot; we go to Dengeos. Big, fresh salads optional with chicken or gyros. Speaking of gyros, they&apos;re fabulous. Terrific Athenian or Bar-B-Q chicken dinners, skirt steak or tilipia dinners all w/baked potatoes or terrific fries, enormous Italian beef sandwiches,hamburgers, tuna melts, spareribs, and more. Milk shakes! Great place fto bring little kids all who get balloons. Order your food and find a booth or table. No tipping but it&apos;s nice to leave $1 or $2 for the servers who clean your table. A big parking lot outside. A nice mix of folks. Very popular in the area.

Best Salads Ever!!!!!!!!!!!
Very good fresh food. Along with great Burgers and Hot Dogs they serve excellent grilled chicken and skirt steak. The place is clean and very reasonable. Fast food all served on real china and real silverware a very nice touch. They will chop and toss any salad on the menu for free. My personal tip add bacon to anything including salads only 80 cents more. Personal Favorite Grilled Chicken Salad chopped with bacon. Free refills on all sodas.

I had a fantastic Italian Sausage Sandwich here. I guess you would expect such high quality, at a reasonable price as well, if the restaurant is to survive and thrive in the Chicagoland area.

Slick&amp;quick.

Recommended for a yummy lunch.

I took my mom to lunch at Dengeos (or as she has repeatedly called it &quot;Dang-gay-oss&quot;) a few times and each time I come back I forget how great this place is.

The restaurant has plenty of room and seats. They have balloons for kids and all the amenities for a modern restaurant / grill (soda machine, condiments, etc). Bathrooms are clean and their hand dryers don&apos;t just blow out puny tufts of air!

Service is nice, polite, and quick, and waiting in line at the counter to order / pick up my meal is effortless. The tables are cleaned non-stop -- once someone leaves, their table is cleaned seconds later for the next person to sit down.

I also witnessed an older woman return her chicken (&quot;too burnt&quot; but it looked lightly charred) and the staff was very nice and apologetic, bringing out a new meal minutes after being returned.

I&apos;ve ordered a variety of items on the menu in the past, but these past few times I just ordered a 1/3 pound burger and gyros sandwich. Both were pretty decent, not much to complain about nor overly praise. While it&apos;s not the best burger/gyro I&apos;ve had recently, it&apos;s a step up from fast food like BK or McDs. Prices are decent too.

Great neighborhood grill that&apos;s always well visited by its patrons, great atmosphere.

Still a favorite after many years. Best gyros and Greek salad. Not sure why this is described as a &apos;barbecue&apos; place, no bbq that I can see but it would probably be good. Some times are busier than others, but for food cooked to order, not bad. Save room for the chocolate cake.

Good for weekday takeout.   It&apos;s always busy so they must be doing something right.  Good greek salads, baked potatoes, and their chicken breast meal is moist and large portion.  I get it a salad and an extra baked potato and the kids and I have a nice dinner.

Has a large menu of Chicago classics so there is something for everyone - dogs, italian beef, etc.   The Chicken Philly sandwich is great - but huge.

Pretty good food, especially for the price! Got the gyro platter and my husband got the bbq chicken. I would recommend the bbq over the gyro. The gyro meat was cut too thin and did not have the most flavor. The chicken was very tasty and flavorful.

Great food. Quick service. Amazing customer service.

Really. They value their customers.

I frequent this restaurant often, as I work right down the street. I come here with co workers, as well as by myself.

On a recent occasion, I was by myself and ordered one of my usuals (Chicken Cesar Salad w/ chopped tomato and onion!). I was fumbling in my purse and realized I left my wallet at home (I&apos;m a ditz).

I looked up, embarrassed, to tell the cashier to cancel my order, when he handed me my receipt and told me to get my food and that he trusted that I would come back someday soon.
I was blown away.
One does not run into situations like this often. And perhaps this particular cashier is just a generous and kind person, but as an employee of Dengeos, I feel that he represents how they feel about their patrons.

I really wanted to relay this story on Yelp.

Aside from that, the food really is great. But it&apos;s the service that will truly keep me coming.

I have spent a lot of time, here on Yelp, reviewing fancy-schmancy restaurants... and have totally ignored the normal day-to-day ordinary restaurants that we tend to frequent.

So, here we are at Dengeos... we go there frequently with mom, and she always orders the same thing... Chef Salad, no onions, no black olives, no peperoncini.

My sister and I often order the same with our own permutations... I like peperoncini, and she likes to top it with skirt-steak!

Not once, have the order-takers given us any grief. They&apos;ve never said &quot;you know, it doesn&apos;t COME with skirt steak&quot;... or &quot;we&apos;ll have to charge you extra&quot;... they just say &quot;sure&quot; with a smile.  I love that.

The food is consistently good.  Their Chef Salad is large and excellent.  The only complaint I can think of (and I have to try to think of one) is that it&apos;s all ice-berg lettuce.  I happen to like ice-berg lettuce, so for me it&apos;s not a problem.

Their kabobs are good, their burgers are plain, but good, their fries are good, their ribs are good..... it&apos;s all good.  Nothing is outstanding, nothing is amazing... but hey, it&apos;s served quickly and you&apos;re NOT paying a huge chunk &apos;o cash!  get over it.

And, of course, they&apos;re known for their gyros and tsatsiki sauce... (at least for we non-greeks)... you know it&apos;s not designed for true Greeks, cause they call it &quot;cucumber sauce&quot; to cater to the non-greek crowd.  Whatever, its good.

Well, where do I start? I have been a patron going back to the days when it was a tiny little shack. I used to live in the area and probably have eaten here 100+ times. Now I am closer to the BG location, so they get more visits.
Still when in the area (within 5 miles) I am stopping here for lunch. Even dragged the whole family coming back from a Cub game this year. That&apos;s right, between Wrigley and Dengeos there are a ton of options, but I was set on stopping here.

I love their chicken kabob and is usually my selection 90% of the time. Italian Beef is also very good and the portion is generous. Ribs are another good choice. I used to get the Gyros plate more often in my younger days, but now just can&apos;t take it more than once or twice a year.

Keep up the good work!

Ok so to the lady who is complaining about the owners daughter! The owner does not have a daughter that works there.  You seem to have a personal complaint. I have been going here for years and everyone is amazing! Great customer service, great food! U really should not be paying attention to people rolling their eyes. You&apos;re there to order food not make best friends!!!!  The owner is never there his son Nick runs it and does a great job at it! Remember this is not eating at the four seasons this is a great family fast food restaurant!! Great service

There&apos;s nothing like it in Tucson, but that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t review it from afar! All I wanted tonight was italian beef, dry, with au jus on the side and an order of garlic bread and fries. Nothing out in AZ comes close to the big D, so feeling a bit nostalgic I decided to see what yelpers in the land of lincoln have to say, and I&apos;m glad the feelings are mutual. I think I probably ate here 2 sometimes 3 times a month growing up, (and everyone wondered why I was a little plump, odd) and for good reason. Prices are great on quick feel good food (seriously nothing tops their garlic bread). I know that over the years they&apos;ve made some changes, many I can get on board with, some (like the layout/decor) seem forced (it&apos;s a dive, go with it), but all in all the place makes me happy, and I wish I was closer than 3000 miles to it.

Great &quot;high-quality&quot; grease-food fix.  Burgers, gyros, even salads and dinners.  Been going here since high school and the only change has been the renovation a few years ago.
FYI, it gets SWAMPED at lunch time and dinner, finding in house seating is a task.  Come early or later for a better experience.

My wife and I split a char-broiled hamburger and gyros sandwich. Each was prepared quickly, tasted fresh and great. The portions were fine, too. Between the 1/3rd pound burger and gyros portion, we were full when we were finished. The total was slightly under $10.

We will be coming gain, maybe for the ribs next time.

But...

If you&apos;re into the Italian combo (Italian sausage and beef combined) this place is a must! The best combo I&apos;ve ever had.

Great family restaurant.  As cheap as any fast food joint, but much more healthy.  We have been going here for years and are happy with the quality and abundant quantity of the food whether we dine in or carry out.   Our favorites are the RIBS!!! Chicken kabobs, Gyros, pasta, hotdogs (kids).  THANK YOU!

Please do something about the cleaning product smell when you enter.  It is overpowering.  I think it is coming from the bathrooms.  Gyros and polish sausage are the only good thing there.  Chicken is dried out, hot dog buns are stale and burgers are not close to being good.  They need to revamp the menu.  Remodel is very nice compared to other greasy joints.  Sad to say we live a few blocks away and don&apos;t frequent it much.  Would love to see a change.  They have potential for greatness but settle for okay.a

Great food! I love how the service lines move FAST, and orders (whether dine-in or carry out) are filled quickly. There are ALOT of people that work there, making the establishment run quite smoothly.

Their chicken breast plate/entree is HUGE! Fries are tasty and moist, not overly cooked. Only thing I would say is their chicken noodle soup is waaaaay too salty. Other than that, I&apos;ve had a great experience here! I would come again!

Dengeo&apos;s is THE alternative to Pita Inn and Portillo&apos;s!!!!

Been eating here since Day 1. Lived next door for 19yrs.
Everything there is delicious, but.....as time has gone on I can say I don&apos;t like their fries anymore. I compare every Gyros I have had to theirs, and nobody else has done it! The place has expanded a lot over the years, and has all the makings of a sit-down place, but with an order counter and quick food.

I have had better Gyros when I lived in Northern Cali, but so far Dengeos&apos; gyros is the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago (I have yet to try &apos;Hellas Gyros&apos; - so I might need to update this review after that).

It&apos;s a no  muss no fuss kind of restaurant.  Definitely leaning towards family dining and kids friendly - judging from the tons of balloons ready for a grab.

They have almost everything you can think of (but pizza): hotdogs, burgers, Italian beef sandwich, pasta, ribs, gyros, American sandwiches, etc.

Place your order, fill your cups, grab a seat , wait until your order # is called, and enjoy your meal!

UPDATE: I had my salad and really liked it. The veggies were fresh and crisp. Also had a skirt steak that was a little well-done (we should&apos;ve specified), but tasty regardless.

***************************************
Regrettably, it took us two years to finally check this place out. As strongly recommended by our friends, we went at last...and we are so ready to go back for more.

It&apos;s not a fancy restaurant, but a family-oriented fast food joint. I&apos;m not sure how ethinic it is, considering they serve all sorts of stuff, like ribs, pasta, hot dogs, burgers, deli sandwiches and Italian sausages and beef. But in any case, the food is delicious.

The chicken is soft and juicy, and the BBQ sauce isn&apos;t overwhelming. Good turkey, too, especially with melted cheese. And I&apos;m in love their toasted pita that comes with the sandwich...it&apos;s sweet and crispy. The dinner plate comes with three sides - garlic bread, cole slaw and fries or rice. My next order (probably tonight&apos;s dinner) will be the greek salad and an ice cream cone. Can&apos;t wait.

There&apos;s a big parking lot in the rear. I guess they need it...the place is always crowded!

Sometimes, when I&apos;m extremely stressed/tired/moody/worried about money, I regress back into the mind of a teenager, wondering why I ever left my mother&apos;s Evanston house in the first place.

During these times, one of the many things I miss is never being farther than a few minutes walk or drive to Dengeo&apos;s.

What&apos;s not to love? It&apos;s cheap, clean, spacious, the menu is extensive, the food is good, and you don&apos;t have to deal with waiting for a waiter (though I know this can be a deal breaker for some of you fancy people). Dengeo&apos;s is basically fast food&apos;s classy friend, and you should get to know her.

One tip, if you want to order a Greek salad, order the Dengeo&apos;s Salad instead (it&apos;s closer to Greek salads every where else.. w/ Romaine, olives, and feta, while their &quot;Greek salad&quot; is iceberg lettuce with I believe anchovies, ick!) What I like to do is order it with the oil and vinegar dressing and a couple sides of tzatziki sauce (free). Their tzatziki (and fries) are nowhere near as good as Cross-Rhodes, but still do just fine. Also, the salad comes with Greek pita, which is clearly the best Pita out there! YUM!

Oh My dear Dengeos!!!! How I love thee.....

....let me count the ways.....too many to count.

When you walk in you realize that this place is clean and is self serve. You can still enjoy a nice sit down meal without having to deal with a rude waitress that you are obligated to tip anyway. Ample parking and they are very kid friendly with a menu and balloons set up for them.

I usually get the BBQ chicken meal with a baked potato and garlic bread and cole slaw (WHEW!!!! that was a mouthfull)! Read closely folks, because this is a super saver meal that is most definitely good for two(or just you, if you are super ravenous). The BBQ chicken meal comes with 3 large pieces of chicken charbroiled and slathered with BBQ sauce. The garlic bread is to die for, it isn&apos;t too greasy of garlicky. Its just perfect. The baked potato come with all the fixings. It costs 7.50 Plus tax. Its located in the heart on LincolnHOOD and its a perfect place to go if you are hungry from doing some shopping at the mall down McCormick. Its great for rowdy groups like ourselves because everyone else is just as loud. Service is fast and friendly (Just how i like it). The food tastes amazing.

I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way for it....but if you are in the hood, I would go. I am a repeat customer...ive eaten so many chicken meals here that I believe the Kernel is jealous of my love affair with Dengeos.....oh well.

The best attribute of Dengeos Restaurant is not the food.  The building has been renovated from a small, hut-style restaurant (possibly having its roots in the gasoline business). It&apos;s current configuration is an attractive, well designed restaurant with ample parking.

The dining area is kept clean and employees keep up with it at regular intervals.

You order your food, pay for it and receive a number. They call your number and you pick it up--there is no waitstaff. Soft drinks are self-service.

I know a lot of people enjoy Dengeos, but I think the food quality and portion size leaves room for improvement.

Portions are large (I had the half Greek style chicken dinner) and come with everything but the kitchen sink. The decor isn&apos;t so awful, you can tell some thought was put into it - think, if Portillo&apos;s had an affair with Potbelly&apos;s, this would be it&apos;s lovechild. Yes, you could get the same food at hundreds of other places in the city and elsewhere, but if you are driving on McCormick in Skokie... why not.

If you go keep this in mind:
1. Try &quot;dinner plate&quot; items - there is more than enough to share
2. Kids and families are welcome
3. Stick with the Greek style and char-broiled items

SO! Not a bad spot if you&apos;re on the run or out with your kids after little league...

The best gyros I&apos;ve ever had. Granted, I don&apos;t order gyros often (they&apos;re so salty at other places), but these were soooo good! I had the gyros dinner ($7.99) that comes with a MOUND of not-too-salty gyros, tomato, onion, warm pita bread, tzatziki sauce, and your choice of fries, baked potato or rice.

Now I&apos;m worried because I liked the gyros so much that I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ll order anything different from here, but the pork kebab and Greek chicken sound so enticing!

This place was packed at 4pm on a Tuesday and rightly so. Go immediately! I&apos;ll be accepting slices of their chocolate cake as gifts. :)

BBq is calling my name. Their BBq  chicken rocked my inner being -- mainly my stomach. Ha!

Went here not to long ago with friends to check out this new BBQ place. Heard it was good and the chicken was mmm..mmm.. fall of the bone good. Juicy and tender, no need to karate-chop it with a knife beforehand.
On the other hand, my friend who ordered the ribs were so-so.I thought it didn&apos;t have much meat and it felt like sucking dry bones. Their sauce was ok but could have been better. I like how they gave 2 garlic bread loaf for you, which i made into a shredded chicken sandwich. My friend just looked at me weird. What &apos;s so weird about that? I even put fries in my sandwich, so there!

I would definitely come back for the chicken cause it spoke to me. It spoke to me indeed. =)

Been a staple for some time in the area.

Charbroiled Hamburgers are large. They are known for their Gyros and have excellent cucumber sauce. Fries are typical. I&apos;d rather have BK&apos;s.

I always get the gyros dinner. Always great.

I also like their Greek salad.

The Greek chicken and Greek salad here are what I always end up getting when I visit. The chicken and rice soup is crazy good. They have good ribs and gyros also. For some reason their fries are addicting here, nothing special about them, regular unseasoned/unsalted fries, but so good! The place can get pretty packed but the wait isn&apos;t too long for a table. They have a lot so parking is never a problem, there is outdoor seating but very limited for those of you that like to have the nice breeze.

Went on a mon. late afternoon. Had said I was going to go many times. Nice looking building. . .have parking (I heart parking). Nice clean look outside and inside too. Family oriented with all the baseball sponsorship photos. . . I liked that.

Was not at all expecting to order from a menu on the wall (as opposed to one in my hands). . .OK no problem. . . moving on to where we &quot;pick-up&quot; our food ( as opposed to someone bringing it to us). . . OK no problem. . . moving on to getting the food to the table and having the heavy china salad bowls and platter ( I liked that) for the greek chicken  ALMOST slide off the cheap, slick plastic overloaded tray. . . THAT WAS CLOSE. . .OK That&apos;s a problem. It happened to another guy too as he passed our table.

We sat in a very clean ( and getting cleaner) dining room. A diligent lady cleaned something the whole time we were there. A mother with 3 small children were at the next booth. A large nearly full pop got spilled accidently, and she was right on it (I liked that) The dining room was spacious and gave off a comfortable atmosphere (I liked that).

We ordered the Greek Salad (I liked that), the Ceasar Salad (it was OK), 1/2 Greek Chicken (I really liked that), and Philly chicken sandwich ( I did not like that-dry, dry, dry). The total was $30 (I did not like that). For what we got and how we got it (self serve) I thought it was too much. If they either had sit-down and waitresses for the same $30 or walk up and throw away dishes for 20% less, I might go back. I wanted to like this place, but there are other places just as good for less. Thanks Dengeo&apos;s and keep helping the kids.
