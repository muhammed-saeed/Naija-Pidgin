 June 18th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
Life is so busy for most habitancy these days it’s no wonder that most readers don’t even get past page 18 in a book they have purchased. And if that wasn’t adequate check out these other statistics:

Book Store

- 80% of Us families did not buy or read a book last year.

If you are one of those who have fallen into one of the above book categories, then you’re going to love audiobooks in all their glorious forms.

Listening to audio books does count as reading so if you read using audio books you can get straight through even more than if reading a quarterly book, for instance I can get straight through an audio book within three hours as compared to reading three books in 2-3 months. So if you’re anything like me you love reading and don’t have the extra time, audio books can give you the opening so that you can read many more books which you might not otherwise have time to read.

In the morning while doing my chores or exercising, production breakfast, dressing up for work, etc, I listen to my novel in audio book format.

 Myth Busted–All it Takes is data goods Creation and They Will Come 
 June 11th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
Build it and they will come. This myth has been cause of the destruction of more hi-tech businesses than any other. Canadian businesses have suffered from this myth for generations. I remember a Canadian computer enterprise called Dynalogic. One of the earliest of the portable Pcs it in case,granted full Ibm Pc potential in a computer the size of an Osborne 1. This was in 1982 when Ibm Pc weighed 30 pounds (not counting the 10 pound Crt). Ibm Pc? That’s what the Wintel Pc was when Ibm was the only game in town. When Dynalogic failed despite having a superior product (for the time), the blame was laid squarely on the lack of marketing. The money people believed that it was so good, it didn’t need weighty marketing. Big mistake.

 
 
And enterprise on the internet seems to have given this myth a new lease on life.

Audio Book

Yes, you can build a website to sell your eBook or videos or audios or home study kit. But that doesn’t mean you’ll honestly carry on to sell anything. In fact, it doesn’t mean that you’ll even get people visiting your site.

All products—let me repeat that—All Products, need to be marketed in order to be successful. And that includes products on the internet. More so in fact for internet businesses.

There are four elements of marketing that you need to think when you are looking to sell your courseware over the internet.

First, you need to plump a niche that has potential. Naturally creating a product where you have expertise or a passion, isn’t enough. Without customers for that product you won’t have sales.

Second, you need to think the customer when you are creating your course. Are they happier with books or videos? Will they believe you if you use video? Will they believe you if you use books? What are their problems? What pain points are they trying to avoid? What satisfaction points are they looking to achieve? What is prominent to them? Why are they going to buy from you rather than your competitor?

Third you need to originate sales pages that touch the customer and motivate them to take action. These sales pages also comprise an opt-in page as well as the main sales pages for the products themselves.

And fourth, you need to drive traffic. How you drive traffic is a marketing decision. But without traffic no one will ever read your opt-in page or your sales page or buy your course!

I’ve been listening to some audio tapes that I have by Robert G. Allen and worked on one of his recommended exercises. It’s very productive if you easily spend the time e.g. An hour or more and focus well in completing it, plus even repeat it a few times to gain yet greater clarity. Let me know how you go.

 
 
Draw up 4 large quadrants on a sheet of paper. In each quadrant, write one of each of these four questions: What is prominent to me? What do I love to do? What am I good at? What was I born to do? Write your top 7 answers to each. Relax and do not make this a vital and serious exercise. Then rank each quadrant’s 7 answers in order of importance to you.

Audio Book

Finally, using the top 3 responses in each quadrant, write a paragraph or two of what you stand for, what your life will be about and to what/who you will make a difference.

Write the completed purpose statement over and over till you refine it down to a one or two sentence statement that is easy and superior sufficient for you to want to advance and pin up, to easily repeat to yourself often or to carry nearby on a small card.

If you’d like the copy of my jottings when I did this exercise then click here to email me.

My version is not yet perfect to my satisfaction. Here is what I ended with when I first did the exercise:

I collect, organise, simplify, share and replacement empowering self-help data that gives us all easy and easy way to many ideas for fulfilling personal life visions, accomplishing our life’s purpose and living inspired, satisfied lives.

As I‘live’with this statement and float with it for a while, other things and ideas begin to open up. Sometimes it’s good to give something like this a microscopic rest and revisit it a few days later, or even weeks later.

Other questions that you could add to the list, may consist of the following questions from the book“Callings”by Greg Levoy to help you clarify what your gift or purpose is:

If money was no object, what would you do with your time? What do you keep hearing over and over from friends and family? What lesson are you intent on teaching your children? When you go to a bookstore, what section do you plainly gravitate towards? What kind of notes do you have on your refrigerator? What kind of task makes time fly for you? What topic can you speak about with perfect authority?

Plus, from other sources:

What values/things are most prominent to you in your life? What are you currently tolerating? Where are you manufacture compromises in your life? What areas of your life are being taken up by living up to your perception of what others expect of you?

 Eight Dirty dinky Mortgage Marketing Sins 
 May 29th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
In the mortgage marketing world, little things make a big unlikeness . That is also true in marketing yourself as a mortgage professional. Too often as entrepreneurs we get caught up in the“thick”of“thin things”and we lose touch with what truly drives success in our business.

 
 
In the little time we have together I want to remind you (or surprise you) of eight deadly marketing sins that mortgage professionals commit that could be crippling your enterprise growth.

Audio Book

Sin #1–Working“In”Your enterprise Instead of“On”Your Business

I was working with a consulting client recently who was in a sales slump. I decided to accomplish a very straightforward diagnostic. I naturally asked him to send me detailed list with all of their activities for the next three days, email them to me, and then give me a call back. He did his homework and I received email listing all his activities and how much time he spent on them.

With an immediate see I could tell exactly what his question was–- he had forgotten what enterprise he was in. After reviewing his activities it was clear that he was in the“putting out fires”enterprise because that’s where most of his time was spent. Rather than working“on”his enterprise he was working“in”his business.

This mortgage professional (and you) should be spending more time working“on”your enterprise doing things like“planning and marketing,”which have a higher long term payoff.

In his beloved book,“7 Habits for very sufficient People”Stephen Covey hammers this point home using his noted“Time management Matrix.”Dr. Covey emphasizes that too many enterprise owners spend their time doing“urgent–but not important”activities when they should be spending their time on“non-urgent- but important”activities.

Non-urgent–but foremost activities, such as planning and marketing, create continued and sustainable long term growth.

Sin #2—Failing to create and Use a Marketing Plan


Last year I was speaking at a national mortgage consulation and had about 100 mortgage professionals in the room. I asked the crowd to hold up their hands if they had a current marketing plan that they use and refer to on a consistent basis. Only three hands went up!

Even I was shocked. Studies have shown that small businesses that create and consistently use marketing plans contact an average of 30% higher sales than their competitors. Wouldn’t you like to increase your sales by 30%?

Here are a few tips to help you create your marketing plan.

Tip # 1–Start your plan choosing a definite niche store to focus your marketing efforts

Tip # 2–recognize your niche market’s problems, fears and frustrations

Tip # 3–create a marketing message that offers free data (i.e. Extra report) that is relevant to your to your target market

Tip # 4–Break your plan down into mini-plans such as“referral marketing plan”,“advertising plan”, and“postcard marketing plan.”

Tip # 5–Block program 30 minutes every week to communicate your plan.

Sin #3—Failing to Implement Systems

A principles is a enterprise process that generates predictable, consistent, and replicable results day after day. If you want to see a good example of a principles naturally visit a fast food franchise like McDonalds or Wendy’s. Notice how they do the same things, the same way, every single time.

Unfortunately, most mortgage professionals never take the time to“systematize”their business, which results in duplication, waste, chaos, and ultimately lost sales. Sin # 1 is partly to blame for not getting colse to to creating and implementing systems. Sin #4—Not Marketing to Your Client Database


Many mortgage professionals believe that once you“close the deal”and the happy client walks out the door, then the deed is done and you need to move swiftly on to the next prospect. While that’s true, your next prospect might have just walked out the door!

Many mortgage professionals tend to think,“My client just financed their home through me–- they’re not going to buy other home any time soon so why waste my time on them. Let’s find a new prospect.”The fact is that you should be getting 60% to 70% of your enterprise from your current clients through referrals and repeat business.

In your marketing plan you should be including customer appreciation events, monthly or regular newsletters, and greeting cards all designed to stimulate repeat business. In addition, every small enterprise should implement systems that create“multiple streams of customer referrals.”

Sin #5—Not Testing and Tracking Your Marketing Efforts


John Wanamaker’s noted 1886 quote sums it up very well:

“I know that 50% of my advertising is wasted…

…I just don’t know which half!”

There’s nothing worse than spending money on a marketing campaign and not knowing whether it worked. It’s even worse when you continue to spend money on a marketing campaign that you think is working, but truly isn’t.

The only way to invest in your marketing efforts with confidence is to test a campaign, track it, and measure your results. That’s why I advise all the time offering something of low risk, like a Extra report, seminar, or audio Cd to get people to reply immediately via the phone or your website so that you can track your response.

This strategy also allows you to capture your prospects contact data so that you can continue to supervene up with them.

Sin #6—Not Following Up with Your Prospects

Studies have shown that 81% of all sales happen on or after the fifth contact. If you’re a mortgage professional and you’re only doing one or two follow-ups dream all the enterprise you’re losing.

Not following up with your prospects and customers is the same as filling up your bathtub without first putting the stopper in the drain!

Here are 4 keys to developing a prosperous follow-up system:

1. create a lead capture principles that is precise and reliable.

2. manufacture compelling follow-up marketing literature that will drive traffic to your website or phone calls.

3. Systematize the process so that the process happens day in and day out, the same way every time.

4. Automate the principles as much as possible using a contact management principles and/or an surface mailing house to do your mailings.

Sin #7—“Spraying and Praying”

Believe it or not, not everyone is a good prospect for your mortgage services. If that’s the case, why would you spend your costly marketing dollars trying to reach them? It doesn’t make sense. If everyone is your prospect then no one is your customer.

Unfortunately, too many mortgage professionals send normal marketing message using media like radio, bus stop ads, non-targeted unaddressed mail drops, and normal newspaper ads to“spray”their message to everyone and“pray”that adequate people see or hear it to make it worth the investment.

Instead of spraying and praying, narrow your focus onto a definite niche store that truly has a need for mortgage financing and then store to people just like them. If your ideal prospect is an apartment renter paying 900+ per month, then find the apartment complexes where those people live and store only to them. Your response rate will go up and your cost per sale will go down when you begin to target your market.

Sin #8—Not Differentiating Yourself


Did you know that your prospect receives, on the average, over 3, 000 marketing impressions a day! With all that clutter that you have to compete with, how do you make your mortgage enterprise stand out?

How do you differentiate your enterprise in a way that separates you from the competition? Is it with ads that say,“best rates”,“best assistance“, or“unbiased advise?”everyone else is saying the same thing! You need to differentiate your enterprise in a way that stands out from the crowd and gets noticed.

A straightforward way to do that is to keep a close eye on the marketing that truly captures your concentration and make a note of it. Then borrow and modify those strategies and ideas to create your own unique and compelling message.

Conclusion

It’s true the majority of mortgage professionals are committing one or more of these marketing sins, but you can repent and improve. My challenge to you is to take just one or two sins that you’re committing and focus on improving them. When you’ve got them nailed move on to other sin and overcome it. enterprise success ordinarily results from commitment to making small incremental improvements over time.

 Top Five Reasons people Don’t Reach Their Full potential 
 May 18th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
We all know somebody who has an startling talent that they could probably make a living or even get wealthy from. The talent could range from singing, building, inventing, designing-you name it. It undoubtedly gets my“Gears Grinding”as Peter Griffin says on house Guy, when I see citizen living below their means particularly when they relish a God given gift. Wouldn’t it be selfish not to let the world enjoy your talent as much as you do (of course while development a hefty sum doing it)?

 
 
It sounds uncomplicated enough, right? Not quite, there are a large estimate of legible reasons why citizen don’t take a step send and leap into something they love to do. But the top five are legible reasons you should make aware to yourself so that you won’t come to be“Psychologically Entrapped”to the same lifeless habit you feel daily of the week.

Book Store

1. Afraid to Step Out of The protection Nets

Physiologically speaking, every human being has limitations, set to what’s comfortable and what’s not. From Birth our house values have dictated what is undoubtedly appropriate and this also contributes to our“Safety Net”. If you have ever heard the saying“The Rich Get Richer While the Poor get Poorer”then you will take this quote into mass notice when observing the protection net rule. The rich are teaching their offspring how to stay wealthy, to not be afraid to take risks, to risk it all if necessary.

If it’s comfortable then there is certainly something wrong. Poor citizen may teach their children how to be exactly as they are…poor. It may not be known in most cases but it is happening. In return, their children will learn to not take risks on goals that have high risk associated with them, to not spend because it’s too“Risky”, and stay where they are because it’s comfortable.

Myself as an example, I refuse to wear shorts outside the house. This act is very risky to me because I hate my legs. But what if I wore shorts one day and a tall man walks pass me. He then stopped in his tracks and says,“My God, what beautifully odd shaped legs you have. I must book you for a high paying photo shoot.”He hands me a card, it reads: Paul Lempkin, High Fashion Photography for Odd yet Beautifully Shaped Legs.”Get my drift? Sometimes, it doesn’t hurt to try distinct things that lie outside of your protection net.

2. Life’s Circumstances

You may not be pursuing your life’s dream because you have psychologically entrapped your mind into believing there is no way, no way out and no clear path to take (Do not pass go. Do not collect 0). I undoubtedly believe that everything we do is a succeed of the mind which has been conditioned to believe or think a determined way. A mind could be conditioned by a spouse, media outlets, co-workers, religion….yada yada yada. After all those forces have influenced your mind-good or bad- you need to focus and redirect your attentiveness to You! Never entrap your mind to believe whatever other than“I can do it!”

You want to buy a house, come to be a home owner? Yes. Ok, you have bad credit, particular parent of two school aged children and a job that just pays the bills. No way out, huh? No way in this world that person like you could ever come to be a homeowner. Wrong, I’ve read books on testimonies where citizen with no job got home loans and became home owners. Just like that. Every situation is unique but if you can“De-Entrap”your mind and come to be what I like to say a“Creative Researcher”you can make your way to anything. Researching brings us to the third calculate why citizen don’t reach their full potential.

3. Pure, Unadulterated Laziness

Yes, your heard me. I know too many citizen who talk about a whole bunch of nothing. They talk so well that they have most citizen believing in their ideas and wanting to lend a helping hand. Do not get sucked in by talk because actions speak louder than words. Like Nike,“Just Do It”. Whomever came up with that catchword must have known person who talked the talk. Always speaking of what they want and are going to but Always sitting in the same spot on a line we call life and don’t ever move. Life is trial and error, increase and learning. Embrace it. Stop being lazy!

4. An plenty of“Nay Sayers”

Plain and simple, you as an personel trying to succeed will Always have“Nay Sayers”colse to you. Some of them do it intentionally, to hurt you because of jealously and not being content with their own personal lives. A few of them will do it because of ignorance and fear of them not wanting to see you fail. Either way“Nay Sayers”need to be deleted from the equation. Many will fail from listening to others negative comments because they aren’t strong enough to withstand the negative pressure.

Like how the firm FedEx got its start is a prime example. FedEx got its start with an idea for a study paper. FedEx was an imaginary delivery firm that offered fast overnight shipping services. His teacher told him it was a ridiculous idea and gave him an awful grade. He quit school and started his company. FedEx is now a multi-billion dollar company. In your face, right?

5. Good Ole’Patience

This world is technologically industrialized and so fast paced its remarkable how a person copes. We have fast food, quick service, suitable shop and high speed internet. everything is in your face and Adhd fast. Then when person or something is not so fast, citizen get angry, bored and eventually stop. When something doesn’t come faster than we expect we quit. The best things in life are things in which we wait for. Patience correlates with measurement and perseverance without those qualities full inherent will never be reached.

Much Love,

Leah

 Culture Plays a Role 
 May 8th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
Ever consideration how many television ads you see tell you 1) how to lose weight and be happy on this diet or that diet, 2) why you should eat this food because it is wholesome and will help you lose weight or lower your cholesterol, 3) that“bad”foods seductively portrayed as delicious, smooth, velvety, creamy, and luscious–will make you feel best emotionally? Ever consideration how many magazine ads tell us how we should look in order to be happy, healthy, beautiful, sexy, desirable, and successful? 

 
 
Ever feel bad, ugly, fat, undesirable, and unhappy while finding these ads?

Book Store

When I worked at a drug store as a cashier, I stood over from the magazine racks filled with models and titles telling me how to lose weight, dress right, get the excellent man, etc. I felt bad about myself every time I stood at the register, but didn’t know why. Even after I figured it out, I still couldn’t stop my mind from believing what the magazines told me. Have you ever felt this way?

Reality check–only 2% of us look like the models on the magazine racks yet we are told we should look like them. Because this is the portrait of beauty and success, the rest of us may try to diet to accumulate this impossible standard.

This can lead to a cycle of dieting and regaining the weight (often more than you lost), binge/purge cycles, restricting positive foods, or inordinate exercise. All of these methods are unhealthy for your body as well as for your soul.

The diet industry knows this and spends billions of dollars every year reminding us straight through television and radio commercials, magazine ads and stories, news media, television and movies, that fat population are ugly, unhealthy, stupid, sad, angry, undesirable and unsuccessful.

Who wants to be those things? So we diet, we try not to eat, we vomit or use laxatives, we exercise too much or feel bad because we don’t exercise enough. Yet 95% (or more) of diets don’t work.

Most of us will gain back all the weight or more and feel increasingly out of operate with food. In addition, gaining and losing weight is hard on your body and can lead to more health risks, including a full blown eating disorder.

Some moving statistics taken from the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination (www.cswd.org):

o Americans spend billion dollars annually on diet products. This is more than the Gnp (Gross National Product) of more than half of all the nations in the world, including the whole country of Ireland.

o 70% of normal-weight girls in high school feel fat and are on a diet.

o Over half of the females studied in the middle of ages eighteen and twenty-five would prefer to be run over by a truck than to be fat, and two-thirds would pick to be mean or unintelligent rather than fat.

A Harvard study of Fiji culture provides a grim example of how Tv ads impact self image. The study found that before the introduction of Tv 3% of women reported vomiting to operate weight; only 38 months after the introduction of Tv that whole climbed to 15%, with 74% reporting feeling“too big or fat”at least sometimes.

Media, society, and diet ads conduce to how we feel about ourselves. How we grow up and our parent’s (and other’s) attitudes about food play a large role as well. 

You have the potential to stop the cycle. You can learn to stop dieting, binging, purging, over exercising or resisting exercise, hating yourself and your body, and feeling shame every time you eat.

Some behavioral changes can make a big contrast (see my report“5 Steps Toward Living a Diet Free Life”on my website). I have found that manufacture changes to your connection with food can have a big impact on how you feel about yourself and your body.

Several books, websites, and articles address the subject. Some of my favorites are: When Food is Love by Geneen Roth and Fat!So? by Marilyn Wann.

If you want or need extra support, consider counseling. Counseling can help you heal the emotions that may be driving your dieting behaviors and retention you back from living your life. You can learn to stop spending all your time reasoning about food and your body.

You can have more power to spend on the important aspects of your life: family, children, friends, and relationships.

 May 6th, 2012 | Author: digitalaudiobookstore 
 
Every year thousands of businesses fail. While most businesses failures occur while the first three years after founding, any enterprise can fail given the right conditions. Well known and thorough causes of failure include: unmatched competition; under capitalization; runaway costs; inattention to customer needs; unmatched global pressures.

 
 
Of course, the ultimate fancy for enterprise failure is the lack of cash.

But, there are five surprising basal reasons for enterprise failures: laborer theft, Unplanned growth, Catastrophic information technology failures, Poor description keeping, Failure to use advisors. We will observe each and offer suggestions of how to avoid them.

1. laborer Theft

According to the U S accommodation of commerce, employees steal between to 0 billion each year, and is the fancy for 30% of enterprise failures. Theft can comprise taking money from the till, embezzlement, stealing intellectual property, walking away with inventory. Without perfect controls in place, you may be vulnerable to laborer theft. Here are some things you can do to prevent it.

Embezzlement

A trusted employee, writes extra payroll checks to self, or pays bogus invoices maybe to accounts set up by self, or checks to cash. Sometimes the laborer abuses check signing privileges, or alters a check, or forges the owner’s signature.

Prevention of embezzlement includes:

Background check of any laborer handling money.

Being wary if laborer appears to have money problems or breathtaking personal problems (family condition issues, etc)

The enterprise owner, or surface accountant, should open the bank statements and observe each check to verify the payee, amount, and signature.

If practical, the owner should sign checks, or two signatures should be required.

If possible, someone other than the someone who writes checks should balance check book.

Theft of incoming receipts

An laborer diverts incoming cash or checks to his own catalogue or a dummy bank account.

Prevention includes:

Carefully watch receivables

Personally explore if customers complain they are not getting credited for their payments. Get canceled check copies and observe front and back to conclude if they were properly deposited in your account.

Have two employees complex in counting and verifying receipts

Cash theft

Employees who receive cash in sell establishments“dip into the till”

Prevention includes:

Establishing and following rigid cash out procedures that verify that the starting cash plus the receipts (printed from the register) for the day equal the ending cash.

Verify that the cash deposits equal cash receipts.

Personally explore customer complaints of receiving incorrect change.

Inventory or tool theft

Is your catalogue or tool“walking out the back door”?

Prevention includes:

Keeping a description of enterprise owned equipment, along with serial numbers.

Tag all enterprise owned equipment.

Keeping a description of inventory, along with incoming and usage.

Verify catalogue levels with periodic corporal catalogue counts.

Be suspicious of catalogue shortages, or higher than general catalogue purchases.

Intellectual asset Theft

Could a disgruntled laborer walk out with primary intellectual property, such as inexpressive formulas or customer lists? Your enterprise could suffer dramatically if such information were to get into the hands of competitors.

Prevention includes:

Having all employees sign thorough agreements relating to your intellectual property.

Having a clear written course (in the laborer manual) about enterprise intellectual property.

2. Unplanned growth

Rapid increase of a enterprise may seem to be a breathtaking thing, and often is. However, unplanned increase can be as devastating to enterprise as planned increase can be good.

A enterprise that suddenly receives an order that is, perhaps, equivalent to half the total sales of the prior year may have these challenges:

Can production, personnel, and infrastructure be ramped up fast enough?

Can the stock or aid be delivered on time?

Can customer’s capability expectations be met?

Is there cash ready to pay for material, employees, sub-contractors, etc.?

Will customer cost terms contribute cash in a timely manner?

Is there a line of prestige in place with the bank to contribute needed cash?

Companies have often been forced out of enterprise when overwhelmed by the cash flow challenges of sudden sales growth.

Here are some things you can do to put in order for sustainable growth:

Have a enterprise plan that you periodically spin and update.

Keep your eye on your financial statements, continually projecting cash flow and cash requirements.

Maintain constant palpate with your banker.

Maintain a line of prestige that can be tapped.

If a large sales opening presents itself, seriously reconsider whether: it is consistent with your enterprise plan; it will enable continued sustainable increase (or is just an anomaly not likely to happen again); can be executed to meet customer expectations of delivery and quality; there will be sufficient cash ready to execute the ageement while chronic quarterly enterprise activities.

When confronted with a large sales order try to get the customer to help finance straight through a down cost and expand payments. Negotiate suitable accounts receivable cost terms.

Be prepared to turn down enterprise that is either not strategic or which, after particular analysis, will have a damaging result on your business.

3. Catastrophic It Failures

In the information age many businesses are totally reliant on their computer systems. A brief power outage or server down time is often more than just inconvenient. An extended loss of servers or other parts of the It infrastructure can be catastrophic. Many businesses are so dependent upon their It theory that without it they can not process orders, sustain customers, and perform daily operations. An outage of just a few days has forced companies to shut their doors.

If you are heavily reliant on your It systems, here are some things to consider:

Have redundant servers.

Back up data daily and verify that backup tapes (or other media) actually have the backed up data.

Store back ups in a gather fire proof location.

Have a redundant off-site system.

Contract with a aid enterprise that provides remote inhibitive maintenance on your systems.

Ensure that your aid contracts comprise a suitable maximum response time, along with rapid hardware replacement if needed.

Install and keep up to date thorough firewalls, and anti-virus software.

Establish and enforce suitable Internet and e-mail use policies.

Ensure that all of your software is current and supported by the vendors/developers.

If you have institution software, ensure that: you have all applicable current source code, there is at least one someone other than the developer who knows and understands the inner workings of the software.

4. Poor description Keeping

One observe of businesses filing for bankruptcy reported that 58% of respondents did minute or no description keeping. At a minimum retention good records of sales, expenses, and debts is primary for enterprise survival.

Of the surprising reasons for failure, this is probably the easiest and least costly to prevent. Here are some things to do:

Set up an accounting theory that will description all financial transactions. Using a theory like Quick Books ensures that you will have a workable system.

Use the accounting system! Use it to write invoices, pay bills, and reconcile the bank statement. Print reports showing your cash balance, what your are owed by customers, and what you owe vendors.

If you have two or more employees, have a payroll aid do your payroll. This will not only save work, but will ensure that payroll records are properly maintained and that taxes will be paid on time.

Create a financial corner for at least one year that shows how much money you expect to have come in each month, and how much money you expect to have go out. Use this to help guide your enterprise decisions.

Have a professional (your accountant) spin your financial records at least once a year.

5. Failure to seek and use advice

A enterprise owner who goes entirely on his/her own without seeking and using external advice is much more likely to fail that owners who embrace the advice from surface advisors.

Here are some things to do:

Find professionals that you are comfortable with and whom you trust. These should include: a banker, attorney, accountant, and a general enterprise advisor. Depending upon the nature of your business, and your own skills, you may want to seek out marketing, sales, or other advisors.

Seek opinions from your advisors any time you make a convert in your business.

Keep in touch with your advisors. Don’t just palpate them when you have a crisis.

Understand up front what costs will be incurred when dealing with your advisors.

Create a board of advisors, and meet with them at least quarterly.

Most important-when you have received advice, act on it in order to get the benefits of the advice.

While, as a enterprise owner, you have the capability to control your own destiny, you need to make the right moves and right decisions in order to assure the sustainability of your business.

Positive thinking attitude

 
 
–Have you ever dreaded going to the dentist?—Taking a test, bodily or mental?—That sudden lack of trust feeling?

Audio Book

Why does my mind play tricks on me all the time, and am I too old to learn new stuff?

So the kids are all getting angry with their parents, who are hogging the Nintendo Ds, playing all kinds of distinct Brain training games.

Can the brain cope with this new leash of life, or are they designed just to digest so much facts while our‘development’stage of life.

Several citizen who have spent a lot longer than me in full time education, have researched this very subject. Their findings enumerate that:

Everything you are and have achieved in your lifetime, you only used 5% of your mind power to accomplish this!

5%, can you imagine what you could accomplish just by using an additional one 5%.

When you set out your goals, as recommended by all the top self-improvement Guru’s. Take a occasion to surely to get into the right mindset, yes it is all about positive thinking, but get your known and sub-conscious to get complex and you will kick-start your brain into being more productive.

To accomplish this extra 5% Brain power, there are a number of techniques we can utilize.

–The issue Technique also known as the fullness Course.—Silva Mind operate—Holo-sync audio technology—Creative Visualization—Meditation

All have one thing in common, that is to understand your brain waves. I discovered, that despite my teachers calling me‘brainless’, I have in fact 4 distinct types of brain waves at my disposal.

Beta—The most common, produced by a thinking mind. Used whilst concentrating and being alert.

Alpha—Used whilst day-dreaming and in a relaxed state. This is the brain wave we produce whilst meditating. It also provides the optimum studying and memory retention.

Theta—Produced by sub-conscious mind and deep meditation. This is where your hypnotist is delving into your cupboard!

Delta–Produced by a deep unconscious state. Total body unawareness, possibly this is what my teachers were referring to!

The vast majority of us mortals are controlled by our brain waves, when we should be in control.

Successful people, operate their brain waves, either they are aware of it is an additional one matter.

When you look at the way we are controlled by our brain waves, for instance;

–Saying or doing something you regret later.—Trying to study or read a book, but end up asleep.—Trying to sleep at night, despite all your best efforts, watch the clock!

Now photograph yourself:

–Saying and doing the right thing.—Being able to join fully on your studies or book, without any distractions.—Falling asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow—Remaining calm and collected in a crisis.

Sounds ideal, and the best part is that you can accomplish this mastery of the mind, very easily.

The benefits of controlling your brain waves, are feeling more energized, refreshed, educated and increased concentration.

By the way, it is never too late to tap into the 95% we have not used yet!
