 You might have heard of restaurants where diners suspend 50 metres up in the open air or watching schools of fish swim by 5 metres below sea-level. But have you heard of diners having meals in their bathing suit?

These are rather unique restaurants that are absolutely bizarre and out of this world, making them the most vivid memories of many travellers and food enthusiasts.

Here are my top 10 favorite and most weirdest restaurants , in no particular order.

Enjoy!

 Cannibalistic Sushi (Tokyo) 
 Nom, Nyom, Nyotaimori 

The idea of this restaurant in Tokyo, Japan came from Nyotaimori , an extremely rare practice of serving sashimi or sushi from the body of a woman, typically naked. What&apos;s interesting about this restaurant, is that patrons do not eat what&apos;s on the body, but rather, the body itself!

Patrons are presented with a &quot;human body&quot; made from dough on what may seem to be an operating table and is rolled out into the dining room. Red sauce is added for life-like bleeding and the internal organs are lovingly and accurately reproduced with sushi and sashimi. You can choose between male or female bodies.

 Buns&amp;Guns (Beirut) 
 &quot;A sandwich can kill you.&quot; 

That&apos;s the motto for Buns&amp;Guns, a fast-food restaurant that was located in Sfeir, a southern suburb of Beirut. This military-themed restaurant was filled with military decors such as fake assault rifles, and camouflage netting, as well as recorded helicopter and gunfire sounds.
 
Manager Yussef Ibrahim says that the theme reflects the mood of the city during Lebanon&apos;s 2006 war with Israel, and that while some patrons may find it disturbing, most are amused. You can order yourself an M16 Carbine meat sandwich, a Mortar burger or a Terrorist meal (which happens to be vegetarian). Dishes were also served with names of weapons like Kalashnikov and Dragunov.

According to Wikipedia, the restaurant was found to be closed when last visited in October 2009. A new fast food restaurant, named &apos;Shoot&apos;, had opened up in its place. According to an employee, the restaurant had been sold a few months before. The theme of the new restaurant had no longer anything to do with guns, but was instead focused on sports (&apos;Shoot&apos; referring to a basket ball or a football, as seen in the new logo).

 The Tree House Restaurant (New Zealand) 
 &quot;Let Your Fingers Do the Walking&quot; 

 Official Website 

The Tree House Restaurant was created in New Zealand for a marketing campaign for Yellow Pages . In order to prove that something big can be completed using the Yellow, they built this restaurant 10 metres up a redwood tree.
The whole construction took only 66 days!
 
Linking to the pod-shaped restaurant is a tree-top walkay to provide easy access. The Tree House Restaurant can seat 30 peas or can accommodate 50 peas standing. Okay, I couldn&apos;t help it. I meant guests and not peas. :)

A toilet-themed restaurant in Taiwan proved to be a huge draw. It&apos;s called Modern Toilet Restaurant and has now at least 12 outlets all over Taiwan. Not only do customers seat on a toilet, they also get to chomp down food off plates and bowls shaped like toilet bowls and squat toilets or urinals.
 
The price ranges from 150 to 250 Taiwan dollars ($6 - $10) for a meal set including soup and ice cream. Customers, however, flock to Modern Toilet Restaurant mainly for its quirky dining wares and interior decor.

 Clothing Optional Dinners (Manhattan) 
 Don&apos;t Worry. The Windows Are Covered. 

In Manhattan, a social event is created by nudist activist, John J. Ordover . Clothing Optional Dinners happens once a month where nudists or naturists gather in various restaurants around Manhattan. Once they enter the restaurant, they will disrobe to nothing, either in the restrooms or right in the dining room, and carry on as per normal. Each patron will have to bring a towel to sit on and their motto is &quot;No hot soup&quot;.

Such gatherings will definitely raise a few eyebrows, but the mention of actually attending such a gathering is sure to elicit the exact same look on everyone&apos;s face. And really, the windows will be covered.

 A380 In-Flight Kitchen (Taipei) 
 Named after the Airbus A380, largest airliner in the world 

 Address: 168, Dingzhou Rd Sec 3,
Taipei City (台北市汀州路三段168號)

Imagine a flight without security checks, turbulence or even ticketing. A seat with seatbelts and no smoking lights. More importantly, there&apos;s more than just fish or chicken for dinner.
 
Over in Taipei, a restaurant is named after the Airbus A380, the largest double-deck airliner in the world. The A380 In-flight Kitchen looks pretty much like the airliner it is named after. But it has only one floor.
