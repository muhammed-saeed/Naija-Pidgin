Cup Dispensers

Use the right cup dispenser for your office or store
 Tweet Whether you work out of an office or have a restaurant or convenience store, you need a cups dispenser to store your cups until they are used. The office has the water cooler with the Dixie cup dispensers and maybe a beverage cup dispenser in the break room. The convenience store or fast food restaurant has the multi-compartment cup dispenser near the soda fountain so your customers can select the cup size they want.

Many manufactures provide a restaurant cup dispenser or Dixie cup dispensers. First, you need to know what type of beverage cup dispenser you need for your workplace or store. Look at:

1. Multi-compartment countertop cup dispensers for your store.

2. Cups dispenser accessories.

3. Paper cups dispensers for your office cooler or break room.
 

Choose cups dispensing units for your restaurant or store

Choose cup dispensers that dispense the type of cup you are using. Will you use paper, plastic or foam? What sizes do you need? Check to see if the cup dispenser unit can work with multiple cups sizes and materials so you do not have to buy new beverage cup dispensers when you change type of cups.
 Try:  Stak-Pak offers a&quot;fits all&quot;cup dispenser that allows you to adjust cup size from extra-small to extra-large without removing cups. These cups dispensers work with any type of cup material as well, foam, plastic or paper from almost any manufacturer. These cup dispensers clean easily, also.



Select the cups dispensing accessories you need

You also need lids dispensers to go with your cups dispensers. Cold drink items need straws, and coffee and hot drink items need stirrers and cream and sugar packets. You must provide your customers with napkins, so you need napkin dispensers.
 Try:  Globe Equipment Company offers wire lid dispenser units to go along with your cup dispenser units. You can choose from the three-compartment wire lid unit that sits on the counter top, or the wall mount unit to save countertop space. Velter Products offers a full line of dispensers from straws to lids to napkins and more. Choose from several styles including counter top dispensers and wall mounts.



Buy Dixie cup dispensers for your office water cooler

Water cooler bottled water is a great idea for the office and a lot less expensive than individual bottles of water. Just get your Dixie cup dispenser to go along with it, and serve your employees and customers with cold water drinks.
 Try:  Toilet Paper World offers cup dispensers that fit both the cone shaped or flat bottom cups. Choose any size from 4.5 ounce to 12 ounce cups. This dispenser can hold up to 180 cups for your thirsty office. ReStockIt sells stainless steel cup dispensers. Look at their line for the durability that comes with stainless steel products.



 

 Keep small paper bags and cup holders available for your customers who want to take their hot and cold drinks with them. The cup dispenser suppliers sell paper bags in bulk, but shop around for the best price.
