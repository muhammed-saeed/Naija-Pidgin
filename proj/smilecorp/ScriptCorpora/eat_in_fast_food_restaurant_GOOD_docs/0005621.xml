 7 Complaint Number: 10463138 Incident Date: July 13, 2011 Date Added to File: June 26, 2012 Description of the Complaint: In july of 2011 we started experiencing lurching. When you press the brake to put the car into reverse or drive, the car lunges when letting off of the brake. Then the wrench light came on and lost all power. After turning the car off and then back on the light went away but not the lunging problem. We took it to the dealership where we bought the car and they did a computer update. It kind of fixed the problem. Now one year later in june of 2012 the car is lurching again, but worse than ever. While sitting in a drive through line, I released my foot off the brake and the car suddenly lunged forward. After reading the many reports online from other ford freestyle owners, this is not an isolated incident. And the there seems to be no fix for the problem. Dealerships are throwing parts at cars hoping to fix the problem but none seem to be working. While car owners are paying exorbitant fees to not have a problem fixed.

We parked the vehicle in a parking lot overnight. We were able to drive it the next morning to the ford dealership for service. It&apos;s happening way too often and it isn&apos;t safe.

When I start the vehicle I have to make sure I have my foot on the brake before placing it in drive or reverse because it will lunge. However, recently my husband was driving it and as we approached an intersection and he started braking for the redlight, it lunged forward with a lot of force - it was scary!

Was told it has cvt and it acts up sometimes. My problems are lunging, rough idle, engine dying. Have been just dealing with it and using recommended fuel and occasional injector cleaner. This weekend( jan 8 2012) I went to change air filter, check tire pressure, etc. I followed the directions in the manual to reset the idle trim and now the vehicle will not move at all. It will idle with no a/c, but the gas pedal does nothin. When you turn a/c on it dies. We have not hit anyone or anything, but have come close once or twice. We drive the vehicle with the anticipation that its gonna move without warning. Any assistance will be appreciated.

 31 Complaint Number: 10430308 Incident Date: September 1, 2011 Date Added to File: October 15, 2011 Description of the Complaint: The car would lurch forward when at slow speed or idling. Would be very difficult to control at slow speed such as entering a parking lot, garage or turning. Happened continuously for months until we were too concerned about safety or damage to the car or others. Had to keep foot pressed very hard to brake to avoid having the car shoot forward. We knew many other freestyle owners had been having this very dangerous problem and hoped for a recall but when the engine light went on we could avoid it no longer and had the throttle body replaced. It cost us just over $900 plus tax to replace it.

 32 Complaint Number: 10429567 Incident Date: July 9, 2011 Date Added to File: October 12, 2011 Description of the Complaint: The first time the problem occurred, I was waiting in a line to exit a parking lot so I was idling when the car surged forward. I slammed on the brakes and the car stalled out. I was able to re-start but then it would surge again. I put the car in neutral and was able to make it out. The car chugged a bit but when I got going it worked fine. A few days later, when idling, the car would either chug and stall or surge. The problem was particularly bad one day and had been doing it a few times. We then were entering the highway and it was like the car wasn&apos;t getting any gas, it took awhile to get the car over 25 mph. We took it to the ford dealership and they said they weren&apos;t sure what they problem was but the readout said it was the throttle body but they weren&apos;t familiar with anyone else having the problem. It seems the problem occurs when it is very hot and the air conditioning is running.

 35 Complaint Number: 10428881 Incident Date: October 4, 2011 Date Added to File: October 5, 2011 Description of the Complaint: My wife was running her routes, making stops for groceries, pet food, etc. It was a sunny and warm day. As she came home, during the last mile, she noticed car behaving erratically (vehicle&apos;s speed seemed to slow down, then speed up, slow down, whatever it wanted). She knew immediately something was wrong because it has never done this before. We have owned it for 2+ years and she is the primary driver. She pulled into our driveway. The garage is 90deg to the driveway and requires driving beyond the garage door entry, then a short backing up and turn of the wheel to align it for pulling in. When she came to a stop, then put into reverse, the car began to really act up, lunging, hesitating,,. She was able to manage reversing the vehicle with running into our barn or into the yard and got it into the garage. She immediately called me several times at work and left me messages on various phone numbers. I think it shook her up pretty badly. We have 3 young children and we do not want to see them or anyone hurt. We did our homework before purchasing this vehicle and decided not to get the awd model because the repair rates were slightly higher. Last night I immediately suspected this to be the culprit though. Before doing any diagnostics, I thought to check a few websites and phone a friend. There are obvious design features that diminish the reliability and quality of this vehicle as related to the most basic feature we expect a car to do - stop when we want it to, go when we want it to. And when these types of issues surface so early in a product&apos;s life, why is the NHTSA allowing them to persist. Is it waiting to see&apos;how many more will come&apos;or raise the priority after someone has been fatally injured? what if this happened while I was in the car line to drop my daughter off for school,, and the kid in front of us was just stepping out of their car??

 38 Complaint Number: 10427941 Incident Date: January 1, 2010 Date Added to File: September 29, 2011 Description of the Complaint: Throttle body issues (possibly transmission as well) cause intermittent surging, unexpected acceleration patterns, stalling or all three. This is especially pronounced with a/c running. The first time it occured I was backing out of a parking space in a crowded mall parking lot. The sudden surge as I was backing out at idle (not depressing the accelerator at all) nearly caused me to hit a pedestrian. Dealer&quot;could not replicate&quot;the issue but suggested a thorough cleaning of throttle body. Have driven approximately 40,000 miles since first incident and cleaning does help for a short while but the surging returns without warning. Clearly a dangerous issue, an accident waiting to happen and I&apos;ve learned (online) this is common in these vehicles.

 45 Complaint Number: 10425638 Incident Date: August 14, 2009 Date Added to File: September 15, 2011 Description of the Complaint: On about 10 occasions my ford freestyle has lunged forward or backward while in reverse without me engaging the gas pedal. It will stop if the brake is applied but it often catches me off guard. About half of the times the car then cuts off (once while attempting to turn onto a very busy street). The car will restart but often cuts off about 2 more times before deciding to run correctly. Usually the check engine light and wrench symbol will illuminate. This is a very scary and dangerous problem. On one occasion, after dropping of my mother at a store I took my foot off of the brake and the car lunged forward coming quite close to my mom who was crossing in front of my car. After taking the car to a mechanic, the P061B code came up for internal control mod torque calculation performance.

 47 Complaint Number: 10424372 Incident Date: July 25, 2011 Date Added to File: September 8, 2011 Description of the Complaint: While starting 2007 freestyle there was a very sudden revving engine sound followed by the car lunging forward. The car was still engaged in park position, my right foot positioned over brake but not on it as I was about to shift into reverse. The revving&amp;lunge stopped as suddenly as it had started&amp;I went on to back up without any problem. The incident concerned me because the car did move forward some..Inches, maybe a foot. It moved enough that my bushes in front of my bedroom window were touching the front rim/bumper of car. I have had many more incidences like this one in the past few weeks. All are unpredictable. Car has lunged while in drive and reverse as well. It has also&quot;sped off&quot;immediately after engaged in drive. It will accelerate without my foot on the pedal. It will stop when I brake but by then it has already covered some ground. The car is having different/opposite acceleration problems when I stop at signs/lights. The car won&apos;t accelerate at all with the pedal pushed all the way. Then it will eventually catch and accelerate.I have had what I think is the power go on&amp;off while accelerating&amp;slowing down, with panel lights go out then on. The steering isn&apos;t effected. The engine itself sounds as normal as any day. My car has 29,329 miles. I had to replace all brakes last week. Brought car to shop&amp;was redirected to the ford dealer. Mechanic gave me code P0701 along with brief explanation of problem. I&apos;m afraid to drive it. It&apos;s not safe to drive. However brief the incidences are, the driver is still without any control over where the car goes for that time. The lunging itself could cause injury to driver. I had my freestyle taken to dealer this morning. I have not heard from service dept. Yet. I have seen huge cost incurred by others. The service dept. Got defensive&amp;abrupt so I am glad that these ford issues are being investigated.

As I took my foot off the gas and placed it on the brake my car lurched forward unexpectedly. This unexpected lurching has increased in frequency and happens both in drive and reverse.

 50 Complaint Number: 10423249 Incident Date: September 3, 2011 Date Added to File: September 4, 2011 Description of the Complaint: While idling in a fast food line with my foot on the brake, the car suddenly lunged forward approximately 2 feet. After approximately another 10 minutes idling in the line, I got my order and was slowly exiting the drive thru lane, when I had to stop to let 3 pedestrians pass by. With my foot firmly on the brake, it lunged forward another time approximately 3 feet, narrowly missing the last pedestrian. The car then stalled. After restarting it, it took over 1 mile of roadway to get the speed up from 0 to 65, with the gas pedal completely depressed the entire time. The cruise control would also not work. The air conditioning was on and the outside temperature was approximately 100 degrees. There were no warning lights on the dashboard when the lunging occurred, however, the wrench icon lit up after I restarted the car and remained on for the 26 mile drive home. Once at home, I turned the car off and restarted it and the wrench icon was no longer lit up. I have not driven the vehicle since this incident for fear of injuring myself or someone else.

 51 Complaint Number: 10423132 Incident Date: June 15, 2011 Date Added to File: September 3, 2011 Description of the Complaint: The car lurched/revved forward a few feet while brake was fully depressed. It would do it in both forward, reverse and park it got worse over a 2 and half month period. The lurching was once in a while and then became more frequent with it eventually happening everytime I placed my foot on the brake, put it in park or reverse. The throttle body was replaced but I have heard this is only a temporary solution, that dirty air passing over the part will make it too dirty to perform properly in the future. We were lucky that it was covered under our used car Warranty and we only had to pay $100 deductible. Most likely if the part gets too dirty to function again, we will have to pay for it out of pocket unless ford creates a solution for the problem.

It is lunging forward without use of the gas pedal. It will also die after this occurs a couple of times in a brief period of time. Typically this occurs when the vehicle is idling or moving at slow speeds. It has caused me to bump the garage wall and near misses with pedestrians when dropping children off at school. I am very concerned that a child will be injured or a car accident will occur. I know another owner of a freestyle who recently had to get rid of hers for the very same reason. She was told it would be too expensive to fix.

The last couple months my car started lunging forward when I would press on brake with the car in either reverse or drive. At first I thought it was my doing somehow but now I know differently. It happen one time while my husband was driving, we were going on vacation, we had stopped at a gas station to get a drink when the wrench light came on and the car stalled and lost power and die in the middle of the street. My husband and I decided not to take the car for we were not surewhat was happening and could not afford to be stranded somewhere and break down. It really starts acting up when it is really hot out or if it is parked and is idling for a little it with the ac running. After it has idled for a little bit you put the car in either drive or reverse and it will lunge forward. One time I almost hit a person walking in front of my car at a drive-in restaurant. My husband and I are now too scared to drive it. I thought it would be a great car for my family but now just want out of it for the safety of my family..

 63 Complaint Number: 10420878 Incident Date: August 16, 2011 Date Added to File: August 21, 2011 Description of the Complaint: The part with a safety issue is the throttle body on the ford freestyle. The car will get a surge of power and lurch forward when in traffic, parking lots, and at stop lights. If the driver is not able to brake in time, the vehicle could hit and/or injure a person or other vehicle in front of them. This is a problem that ford is aware of and has not issued a recall, despite numerous complaints. As the surging power continues to be a problem, the vehicle may also completely lose power while in motion, causing the driver to have no ability to avoid a collision as the vehicle loses power very suddenly.

Had vehicle serviced at ford dealership on 10-21-2010 and was diagnosed and advised to replace all plugs and 1 coil and 7 boots, mileage 78,436. Completed the service as advised, cost $931.35. The problem still existed and engine light came on june of 2011. Had same dealership diagnose and the same diagnosis came back but everything checked out ok. I had the dealership replace the throttle body at my request because of safety issue with the uncontrollable lunging and other ford freestyle&apos;s having the same problem at mileage 85,976 at a cost of $740.41. Today, 8-18-2011 with mileage at 87,600, I have not had any problems with the vehicle lunging uncontrollably. Based on the above description, I believe the throttle body was defective and should be recalled. Additionally, I also believe that there was a misdiagnosis of the initial problem and should be reimbursed both costs. Please contact me if you need further information and documentation. Thank you.

This problem was first noticed in 2008 and the vehicle was serviced by the shamaley ford dealership. In 2008 the vehicle increased gas speed on its own and almost struck my child. The dealership identified the throttle body as the problem, but it was not replaced. We continued to operate the vehicle with the vehicle increasing speed normally during the summer months when its hot outside. I continued to report this problem to the local dealership but they said there has not been a recall. In july 2011 I was operating the vehicle during noon time and the vehicle lunged forward as I attempted to park the vehicle and I almost struck some pedestrians. The shamaley ford dealership has informed me that the throttle body on the vehicle needs to be replaced at my own expense. I researched your website and noticed that their is currently other complaints made against the same type of ford vehicle. During the summer months the engine speed increases unexpectedly on a daily basis. I believe their should be a recall on this defective part before someone gets hurt or possibly killed. Ford stopped making this type of vehicle because they know that there are some defective parts and several mechanical and engineering flaws. Please help us make ford motor co. Understand the seriousness of this problem with the ford freestyles&apos;. Customers should not be responsible for defective parts.

 74 Complaint Number: 10418830 Incident Date: July 8, 2011 Date Added to File: August 8, 2011 Description of the Complaint: Our 2007 ford freestyle has begun to display an issue with surging which appears related to incidents where the wrench dash board warning light comes on shortly there after. It does seem to occur on very hot days when the air conditioner is running. During one incident the car had been restarted after being parked, was idling in gear for several minutes, while my foot was on the brake, the vehicle lurched forward, then stalled. Upon restart the wrench dash board light stayed on. The engine lacked power and would go a maximum of 40 mph even with the gas petal fully depressed. Once at home, turned the vehicle off and let it sit for an hour. It restarted fine, without the wrench warning light, and drove fine for several days. Both unexpected surging and loss of power events have recurred on multiple occasions, with multiple drivers. Recently the check engine light came on and has stayed on. The vehicle drives but seems to lack its usually level of power and will sometimes stall out while idling at a red light. Car restarts and drives fine for a while when another stall out occurs at some other light (unpredictable). Took the vehicle in for service 08/08/11 because it feels unsafe to drive. Ford dealer reports the throttle body needs to be replaced along with the mass air sensor (quoted $1,250 total). In the shop waiting on parts.

Incident happened at 55,000 miles. Slammed on brakes and did not hit neighboring vehicles. Early in june 2011, had our ac replaced which was not working. Immediately after ac was working again, car lunged, wrench light appeared and vehicle stalled during a low speed turn. Car proceeded to lunge and surge regularly when it was put in reverse or drive. With foot firmly on brake and putting the car in park, rpms would go between 3000 and 5000. Then car would die. With experimenting, car would not do it when air conditioning was turned off. We researched internet and learned about surging and throttle body problems. Had fuel induction service performed and have not had recurrence in 90+ days. Did not replace throttle body yet but suspect it will be clogged up again with time and mileage. We can&apos;t predict when the surging will happen. We will not let our teenager drive this vehicle. It is very unsafe and needs to be recalled for this reason.

 95 Complaint Number: 10416241 Incident Date: July 27, 2011 Date Added to File: July 29, 2011 Description of the Complaint: I have a 2007 ford freestyle. About 4 or 5 months ago when I would put the car in reverse or drive (from park) the engine would speed up and it would surge. It would do it maybe once a week. It has been doing it everyday for the past 2 months.It is very scary. When it surges,you have to push harder on the brake to stop it from crashing into something or speeding off down the road.When you push harder on the brake the engine shuts off.I called the ford dealership where I bought the vehicle and it was going to cost me over $940 to fix a problem(throttle body) that is not my fault nor was caused by me,and many other ford freestyles are having the same problem.There are 5 (including mine) that I know of that are having this problem,just in the small town that I live in. But the dealership will not fix it unless I pay $940,because ford has not recalled it.

 103 Complaint Number: 10416038 Incident Date: July 20, 2011 Date Added to File: July 27, 2011 Description of the Complaint: Several times my vehicle surges forward when moving at slow speeds or braking. This has happened while driving forward and reverse. More noticeable when the a/c is on. Even when my foot is on the brake . I can hear the engine revving when this is happening - even though my foot is on the brake.It also loses power on the freeway and becomes very sluggish in acceleration.The vehicle would lose power unexpectedly when driving 10 mph and up. Also I had a minor accident,the vehicle accelerated by itself and I hit a wall in my garage. Also, it would not go forward and when put in reverse it would accelerate--this happened in the middle of traffic during rush hour. We finally took it to the dealer to have it looked at, they told us it was the throttle body and our master tech guarantee did not cover the expense. All they did was clean the throttle up (is expected to have more problems later) because the cost was over $700 and we cannot afford it at the time. So, after we took it out of the shop the car is now only accelerating to no more than 4000

 107 Complaint Number: 10414994 Incident Date: July 23, 2011 Date Added to File: July 25, 2011 Description of the Complaint: Thankfully to date there have not been any crashes or injuries to discuss. However, we have a 2007 ford freestyle. It is a great and safe car to carry our family. It has been great on long road trips. About 1 or so years ago, we noticed these small surges that the car would do when slowing into a parking spot, pulling into the driveway, or parked at a traffic light. Like any good american, we ignored it, thinking it was nothing. We keep the car well maintained, and just chalked it up to chance. Over the past 4 months or so it has gotten much worse. Just two days ago I was driving the car and pulling slowly into a parking spot. There was a cement median in front of me. I wasnt talking the phone, texting, listening to loud music, in fact I was going to a yoga class. I had my foot over the brake, as I was pulling in slowly, and the car surged. I had to really press my foot really hard into the brake. This same thing happened to me when I was as I approached a stop light. I was slowing down, going less than 5 mph and had my foot over the brake. All of a sudden the car surges and I find myself slamming on the break pedal. It is unnerving to say the least. My husband spoke with my father in law, and he sent us a link. As it turns out, this has been an issue. The symptoms that are described online are exactly what is happening to us. I called my local fordland dealer in lakewood, colorado, and he said he never heard of this. I have also called ford customer service and they have escalated the case. I hope this is helpful. Thank you!

 108 Complaint Number: 10415070 Incident Date: July 21, 2011 Date Added to File: July 25, 2011 Description of the Complaint: On a hot summer day in the chicago, il suburban area (7/21/2011, outside air temperature of 100 degrees f), I was completely stopped at a red traffic light. I was the first car in the lane of traffic awaiting the light to transition to green in order to proceed safely through the intersection. Suddenly and while my foot was completely depressing the brake pedal of the automatic transmission 2007 ford freestyle (with approximately 44,000 miles), the vehicle jumped forward (I.E., lunged) approximately 10-feet. While there was no other vehicle in front of my freestyle, no collision was experienced. However, the lunge was significant enough that had another party&apos;s vehicle been in front of my freestyle, I am very confident that a collision would have been experienced. The vehicle dashboard&quot;wrench&quot;symbol then illuminated. I was able to drive the vehicle to the ford authorized service and sales dealer. The vehicle was slow to respond to acceleration in-route to the repair center. In other words, the vehicle&quot;limped&quot;to the service center. The ford service representatives reported their diagnostic code readings were indicative of the need for a new throttle body assembly. Once replaced on 7/22/2011, the vehicle is performing as expected in a normal fashion. I have the defective part in my possession, and I am working to provide the unit to a NHTSA representative.

Lately the problem got worse I went in for service and they finally figured out it was the throttle.

Then now we are in the third month of having this vehicle, and now it cuts off right in the middle of me backing up and the ac on and I would have to turn the car off and restart again. Then the car acts as though its revving up and you could be at a stop light and it will rev up and you would have to really place your foot hard on the brake to keep it from hitting another car in front of you. Took the car several times to the dealership and they said the first time they did not know. They did a diagnostic check up and said they could not find anything. The last time they tell me its the throttle body and then the gentleman proceeded to tell me that&apos;s been a big problem with these cars since they have came out. So this company knows they are selling Lemons to people and they don&apos;t even care.

 123 Complaint Number: 10413346 Incident Date: July 5, 2011 Date Added to File: July 18, 2011 Description of the Complaint: 2007 ford freestyle crossover - the car will suddenly lunge forward, sometimes the motor shuts down and the&quot;red wrench&quot;light comes on. This has been happening frequently in the last month. I have called the dealership and they say they think it may be due to throttle problems. Although I have not done an extensive investigation into when the above happens, I have noticed when the air conditioner is on high, it happens. This may be coincidental but nevertheless I have noticed the surge when the air condition is on. I have researched the internet for others with this problem and there certainly seems to be many people with the exact same problem. There is definitely a safety issue with this in that if you do not currently have your foot on the brake, the car will lunge forward (possibly hitting another car, a pedestrian or have even having a deadly accident). This problem needs to be considered a recall by ford and repaired free of charge by ford. This should be done before someone is seriously harmed.

 126 Complaint Number: 10413195 Incident Date: April 1, 2011 Date Added to File: July 17, 2011 Description of the Complaint: This car is a dangerous weapon. It almost ran over my child. Literally. It self accelerated while she was crossing in front of it. If I had not been paying attention and hit the brake immediately she would be dead, I am sure of it. This car self accelerates in forward and reverse, with no warning while idle. I had it fixed once (it was the famous throttle body) they cleaned it. Car ran fine for a while then started doing it again. Can&apos;t drive the car for fear it will do it again. Can&apos;t trust ford to fix it as they have lied continually and did not fix it when they said they did the first time. Can&apos;t sell it b/c I would feel terrible if someone got hurt b/c I passed it on. I also had to replace the transmission once and now am having transmission troubles again. I believe the carbon build up on these throttle bodies are breaking down the transmissions. Funny thing is ford no longer makes this particular transmission as per their corporate office. It is criminal what they are doing. I will testify in any court and tell my story. A mother who almost kills their child is someone that will not stop fighting for what is right. I don&apos;t know how the people at ford sleep at night knowing they know these cars are out their and that their main drivers are moms and grandmoms. This is beyond the money lost on this vehicle, this is a fight for justice and what is right and most of all, public safety.

Tried to pull back in the parking space and the car stalled, and the wrench light came on. This happened several more times last summer, only when the a/c was on.

 136 Complaint Number: 10412728 Incident Date: June 1, 2010 Date Added to File: July 12, 2011 Description of the Complaint: While shifting the vehicle into&quot;r&quot;or&quot;f&quot;after starting the vehicle, it has a tendency to rev the engine slightly. Keeping firm pressure on the brakes prevents the vehicle from lunging forward/backward. The problem seems to occur more frequently as it gets hotter and hotter. The vehicle&quot;revs&quot;the engine for say 1 second when shifting from&quot;p&quot;to&quot;r&quot;or&quot;f&quot;once every 10 vehicle starts and does seem to occur mainly when the ac is on and the steering wheel slightly turned. Today, 12 july 2011 the vehicle&quot;rev&apos;d&quot;up after picking up our kids at bible camp and once under way the vehicle did begin to die in the parking lot - however the computer must have detected a problem and seemed to restore operations along with the&quot;wrench&quot;light turned on. After pulling onto the highway, we experienced a problem that has not happened since last summer. While the&quot;wrench&quot;is on the vehicle would allow acceleration to approximately 30 miles an hour with the throttle pressed to the floor which is not normal. The car seems fine again now that it has been restarted. I&apos;m not certain the&quot;wrench&quot;and the almost daily engine&quot;rev&quot;for a second are connected. The engine&quot;rev&quot;seems fine as long as you have your foot on the brake. I&apos;m worried about the limited acceleration/&quot;wrench&quot;that has happened three times now in the past 14 months since there is a good chance of an accident when pulling out into a highway when you expect the car to move and the vehicle will not allow normal acceleration. Last year when the&quot;wrench&quot;came on - a ford dealer indicated that the system did not record an event and thus unable to assist with resolving the problem. We have an appointment at the ford dealership again tomorrow, 13 july 2011, to find out if this occurrence was captured by the computer/monitoring system.

 143 Complaint Number: 10411209 Incident Date: August 4, 2010 Date Added to File: July 4, 2011 Description of the Complaint: Several times a week, my car is unexpectedly lunging forward. At this point, it has gone no further than a foot, and it stops as soon as I brake. The trigger seems to be running the air conditioning, and idling. For example, when I was waiting in the line for the drive through bank teller, I took my foot off the brake to roll forward and instead lunged approximately a foot. I immediately put my foot on the brake and the car stopped. It has happened at stop lights and parking places as well. The first time it happened was the end of the summer 2010. It only happened a few times than stopped during the winter, so I assumed it was not longer an issue. It started again this summer, thus the guess about the air conditioning, and is happening more frequently as the summer progresses.

I stopped to let a car pass and the car jumped out into the street. It done it again later that day, but went many days without doing it again. Then we started noticing it was&quot;surging&quot;or doing an acceleration jump when shifting from park, drive, reverse, and any other time we&apos;re having to hold the brake. Our mechanic checked it out and diagnosed it as the throttle bottle. Called the local ford dealership and was informed that ford was aware of the issue, and that the replacement parts were being reworked to remove the flaw and on backorder. Dealer said that owners would receive a notice when the new parts were available, but that ford was not going to issue a recall at this time. My car had just rolled 50,000 miles, it now has nearly 60,000 and I&apos;ve not received a notice/call. I nearly hit a child crossing between me and another car in the school pick up line because this car surged (while holding the brake all the way down). We are now having a/c issues and it is&quot;surging&quot;more frequently. As it&apos;s become too dangerous and costly to drive, we are considering parking it! ford should take responsibility for this flaw before there is a loss of life...

There are times when I reverse or go forward from either a parked position or from a stopped position that the car will lunge. I have to apply the brakes sometimes to avoid hitting another auto. When I do this sometimes the car will stall and the&quot;wrench&quot;light will show up on the instrument panel. I have also had it not go into gear, it will lunge and then when I apply the gas the car will not shift into the next gear. The rpms will go up but even with the gas pedal to the floor it will not engage. I have taken to the car to where I have the extended Warranty and they are stating that they have not heard of this problem. I have been told that without the light on there is no way to know what the problem is. This is a huge issue because there is no way to know when it will happen and you always need to be prepared to apply the brakes and this can result in a stalled vehicle which in turn could be struck by another vehicle causing bodily injury.

While stopped with brake applied car surges and tries to move forward. Latest incident car happened while I was stopped waiting to make a right turn onto a street from a parking lot. Car surged and lunged forward stopping partially into the outside traffic lane where it died. Oncoming traffic was able to avoid my stalled car. I eventually got it started, backed up, and chose a different exit from another side of the same parking lot because there was lighter traffic on that side and I wasn&apos;t sure how the car would perform. Could easily have caused and accident.

 178 Complaint Number: 10402305 Incident Date: May 21, 2011 Date Added to File: May 22, 2011 Description of the Complaint: I pulled into my driveway at a low rate of speed with the air conditioner running and my foot on the brake. The vehicle then lunged a foot forward with my foot still on the brake, completely out of my control. This is the most recent occurrence. My vehicle does this nearly every time I drive at low speeds, but it occurs much more frequently with the air on. To date no damage has been done and no injury had occurred, however my confidence in my vehicle and its safety is severely diminished. I brought my freestyle to the ford dealership to report and correct its lunging tendency. However, they were unable to find a cause, and subsequently a solution, for the problem.

 179 Complaint Number: 10403209 Incident Date: August 20, 2010 Date Added to File: May 21, 2011 Description of the Complaint: On several occassions beginning on this date while driving under 10 miles per hour, the car would lung forward and then when the brakes were applied the car would stall. This&quot;surging&quot;problem would occur once you took your foot off of the brake after being stopped for a period of time but would happen before you pressed the acelerator. Because of the severity of the issue and after almost hitting another car while in a parking lot, we took the car to a ford dealership. They diagnoised the problem and we had to have the throttle body replaced which was a significant cost. Since this issue is currently under investigation, we wanted to submit our experience to be considered and so that we would be notified in the case of recall.

 189 Complaint Number: 10401337 Incident Date: May 17, 2011 Date Added to File: May 17, 2011 Description of the Complaint: I am filling out a form regarding the investigation of the ford freestyle&apos;s&apos;lunging&apos;problem. I had noticed this issue beginning a couple of years ago on my 2007 freestyle limited fwd with cvt. It would be idling and then as I would put the car into gear whether it is forward or reverse, it would rev without my doing. I do not use my ac much at all so I doubt it was on when the revving happened but this problem happens about 2-3 times a month. Luckily, the issue has not caused any accidents, but if there is something that can be done to resolve the issue at no cost to me, I would surely appreciate it. I took my car to capitol ford in raleigh, nc and after describing my problem, they told me I needed to spend $165 on a throttle body cleaning. A service I have never heard of in my life, though they say it is something that needs to be done every 30k miles. I love my car and want to keep it for as long as possible, and ford has always been reliable when it comes to keeping me informed about things needing to be done to keep it running smoothly, but they have never before mentioned the throttle body cleaning until after I inquired about the recall investigation and the engine revving issue. I am wondering if this is the corporate line they are telling their people to tell us freestyle owners in regards to spending money to get this problem fixed before you guys make it a free fix due to a recall. I certainly hope they are not trying to get money out of unsuspecting and loyal owners of their cars that put their family&apos;s lives in ford&apos;s hands each and every day. If there is a known problem, don&apos;t make us pay for it, do the right thing and fix it!

My freestyle lunges up to 10 feet when the driver&apos;s foot is not on the accelerator or firmly on the brakes. Stepping on the brakes firmly stops the car from moving. The problem worsens when the air conditioning is on or the steering wheel is turned a lot. In both cases, the engine idle speed is increased to compensate for additional loads to run the air conditioning compressor or the power steering pump. The incidents of brief acceleration occur in both forward and reverse gears.

 202 Complaint Number: 10362388 Incident Date: June 1, 2010 Date Added to File: October 26, 2010 Description of the Complaint: I noticed that my car began to have a mind of its own, it wanted to accelerate when I had my foot on the brake. More noticeably at a drive-thru when the vehicle would be at a stop and would lunge forward harshly as if I had hit accelerator, I would have to slam on the brake to make it stop. Have almost hit vehicle in front of me on occasion - thank goodness nobody was walking in front of me. The lunge was as if I had hit the gas pedal. This problem continually got worse and it seemed having the a/c on was a factor. I say that because I noticed the problem a time or two at the end of the summer in 09 and it went away until the summer of 10. Also noticed when backing up sometimes the vehicle would just abruptly cut off. I carried the vehicle to the local ford dealer and they quickly diagnosed a problem with the throttle body and apparently I wasn&apos;t the first! the part was on back order for weeks (says alot in itself). Thank god I purchased the extended warranty, otherwise this would have cost close to $1,000 for repair and car rental. Had it not been for that I guess I would have continued to drive an unsafe vehicle because I didn&apos;t have $1,000 for the repair. This makes me wonder how many cases are out there like mine and aren&apos;t being repaired because it is not affordable. This is a huge danger and I hope ford will recall before someone is seriously injured! I did investigate my problem on-line after its diagnosis and found that there are a great deal of people complaining. This is a problem - fortunately it appears to be from a stop and not at a high speed like the toyota problem. None the less still a danger! I notice that this form asks about fire/damage/crash/death or injuries - please encourage ford to address this before anyone has to answer yes.

The problems seems to be worse after the car has been idling for a few minutes. It appears to be worse if the weather is hot.

 219 Complaint Number: 10349284 Incident Date: August 13, 2010 Date Added to File: August 13, 2010 Description of the Complaint: We own a 2007 ford freestyle with a 3l engine. We are experiencing a surging of the engine when the air conditioner is on and we are turning into tight spots such as parking spots. Today (13aug2010) I left the vehicle idling while I went inside a pizza store to buy a pizza (less than three minutes). When I returned to the vehicle and placed it in reverse to back out of our parking spot the vehicle surged in reverse and died. After restarting the engine it would not idle correctly and a wrench light on the dash board came on. The vehicle cut out as I put it in drive to move out of the driving lane and on the ride home the engine would cut out occasionally but never completely died. At home I checked the engine and noticed the top motor mount bushing was broken.

I was setting at a stop sign with my foot on the brake and just as I was easing my foot off the brake to pull out the gas surged and put me in the middle of the road and the car died. It was not a major road and with quick thinking I geared to park turned the key off and started it back up and pulled over into a parking lot while setting in the parking lot it done the same thing.

 223 Complaint Number: 10347191 Incident Date: August 3, 2010 Date Added to File: August 4, 2010 Description of the Complaint: 2007 ford freestyle: life safety issue - several times the vehicle has lunged when backing up or pulling into a parking space, driveway, garage, etc. My foot was not on the accelerator, but on the brake (fortunately). As soon as this happens the fail safe light (wrench light) comes on the dash. You can turn the engine off and back on and the wrench light goes off and the car seems to run fine. Yesterday, the car lunged while backing up and also when my wife stopped at a stop sign. It ran normal for about 5 miles, she pulled over because the service wrench light was on and when she pulled out again, the car had no power. She limped along for a mile or so and pulled off again. Turned the engine off and back on and the car ran fine. I have looked on the internet and talked to my local ford dealer. My dealer has said that it is a throttle body problem and the part would have to be replaced and that it is also a software problem. The internet has numerous forums with other people having the same problem. It is my opinion that this is a true life safety issue. The car cannot be controlled and you have to jam on the brake to keep from hitting someone or something. This happens at least once every couple of weeks and seems to be happening more often. My wife is beginning to be afraid to drive the car with our two children with her. Please look into this issue.

 229 Complaint Number: 10345801 Incident Date: July 15, 2010 Date Added to File: July 28, 2010 Description of the Complaint: We own a 2007 ford freestyle. Two weeks ago, my husband put the vehicle in reverse to back out of a parking space and the engine accelerated. He had his foot on the brake at the time. After that happened, the vehicle lost power and he had to turn the vehicle off and restart. When he restarted, the engine would not shift correctly and the wrench light was on. We drove approximately 2 miles to our destination and turned the vehicle off. When we restarted it to leave, the wrench light was off and the vehicle drove normally on the drive home (approximately 10 miles). We only drove the vehicle twice between that time and yesterday, when I was backing out of the garage and the engine accelerated each time I would start to ease my foot off the brake. This happened 3 times until I got out of the driveway. When I put the vehicle in drive, there were no further problems. I have not taken vehicle to a dealership for diagnosis, but yesterday I called 2 different dealerships to see if I could get information. Both of them said that it has the symptoms of a throttle body issue, and this part is on a national backorder! if that is the case, this must be a massive problem. When the first batch of this part are released, they will go to consumers who have already had their vehicle into a dealership for diagnosis. It was recommended that I leave my car at a dealership and they would have to try to make the vehicle duplicate the problem to get an accurate diagnosis. Then is would still be another 2 - 3 months to get my vehicle repaired. I am afraid to drive my vehicle while waiting for a part.

Incident happened twice in the same day. Warning lights came on. Car was taken to local ford dealership for evaluation. Diagnostics indicated that the throttle body was bad and needed replaced. We were informed that there was a national shortage of replacement throttle body assemblies for this model and that the part was on back order. Estimated time frame the dealership expected the part was mid august. A general internet search revealed many similar stories of ford freestyle owners with similar year cars with similar mileage I suggest an investigation be conducted into why there is a shortage of this part ie to many similar model cars with faulty parts to keep up with demand. This poses as safety concern for my family as unexpected surges could lead to fatal accidents.

The others complaints were minor, door latches etc. It appears that this is really an issue with this car.

I called ford customer care and they confirmed they are aware of the problem and the&quot;engineers are redesigning the part and the dec date is only a projection&quot;I inquired about the dealer giving me a loaner car, was told no, but I could Rent one, I took my car home, in the 7 miles that I drove I had 3 unexpected accelerations. The car is not drivable and now will sit in the garage until who knows when. Nothing has been done by ford to correct the immediate safety issue. My car only has 44000 miles, and has had all recommended services done by the dealer at the recommended intervals.

 258 Complaint Number: 10280342 Incident Date: August 8, 2007 Date Added to File: August 13, 2009 Description of the Complaint: At a stop light in heavy traffic with brake depressed, my vehicle started to rev up very high and then stalled. This continued to do this excessively until I was able to pull off to the side of the road. The wrench light came on only after the problem had occurred. I felt as though the car was out of control like it was going to take off with my foot on the brake. I was afraid that my car was going to hit another car. Everyone around was starring at me like I was some crazy driver! after help arrived, we took to the nearest dealership and was told that it needed a new electronic throttle body which would not be covered under my powertrain warranty. After research, I found that ford had issued a TSB for this matter and is fully aware of this problem but has failed to issue a recall or pay for this defected part. The TSB number is 06-21-1. Still the dealership refused to cover this repair which will be $691 plus the $85 inspection fee. I found that this is a very common problem in the ford freestyles and this is happening to many more ford owners out there. The part is going to take at least a month to get. Ford says it is on backorder. Worst of all, the dealership told me that my car should be drivable until then!!!! my car has less than $50,000 miles on it and it is absolutely ridiculous that ford will not own up to this. I definitely feel that this is a major safety issue and continuing to drive the car will put me and my family and perhaps others in harms way.

 259 Complaint Number: 10274984 Incident Date: June 15, 2009 Date Added to File: June 25, 2009 Description of the Complaint: The contact owns a 2007 ford freestyle. When the contact slowly depressed the brake pedal, the vehicle would lunge forward unexpectedly at least a foot, as if she slammed on the brakes. The&quot;wrench&quot;warning indicator illuminated on the instrument panel. While driving over 50 mph, the rpms would increase and the vehicle would not gain speed. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and they found that the electronic throttle body was defective and affected the powertrain, which her Warranty would not cover. The dealer reset the vehicle codes to clear the&quot;wrench&quot;warning indicator. The repair cost was estimated at $655, which would be at the contact&apos;s expense. The current and failure mileages were less than 64,742.
