 Congress seats depend on Census count Cape Coral census forms feature Fort Myers label 
 
 Q: How does the census count illegal immigrants?

 A: The 10-question census form, which arrived in mailboxes across the country this week, doesn&apos;t ask for Social Security numbers or whether residents are here legally. 

 The goal of the census is to count all people living in the U.S. on April 1, 2010. 

 Undocumented residents may be reluctant to provide personal information to the government because of fears the information will be shared with immigration officials. 

 About 200,000 census partner organizations are spreading the message that answers to the 2010 census are safe and confidential. 

 By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents&apos; answers with anyone, including landlords, other federal agencies and law enforcement entities. 

 All Census Bureau employees take an oath of nondisclosure and are sworn for life to protect confidentiality of the data. The penalty for unlawful disclosure is a fine up to $250,000 or imprisonment of up to five years. 

 Still, Hispanic people remain cautious. Hispanics have historically been undercounted in the decennial census. A review of the 2000 census showed the bureau didn&apos;t count about 1.2 million Hispanics. 

 Just 69 percent of Hispanic households returned the census forms mailed to them in the 2000 census, compared with a return rate of 80.8 percent for white households.
