Baklava takes a lot of time to make. It&apos;s sticky and gooey. You will get messy - thats a given. But it is worth it.

 How to Steam Vegetables 
 Sunday July 8, 2012 
Steaming has to be the easiest way to cook vegetables, hand down! It requires little skill and results in a great taste! There are several different way to steam veggies -- you can do it on the stove top or even the microwave. It honestly is just as easy as opening up a can of vegetables and is perfect for busy families. Plus, I think that steamed vegetables simply taste better and my kids certainly eat them better than canned or frozen. Learn how to steam vegetables ....

If I am not steaming vegetables, I am usually grilling them. I love the flavor of grilled veggies and they pair well with just about everything, from chicken to steak. Grilling vegetables are just as easy as steaming, too! How to Grill Vegetables

 Avocado Hummus Recipe 
 Sunday July 8, 2012 
What I love most about hummus is how versatile it is -- you can make just about any variety of hummus and it will most likely taste good. There are literally hundreds of different types of hummus, from red pepper to banana (yes, there is a banana hummus recipe). One of my new favorite hummus flavors is avocado. I love avocados in warmer weather; they are light and refreshing -- not to mention healthy, too.

Avocados make a great hummus, too. The chickpeas and avocado create a unique flavor that is surprisingly good. I like to serve avocado hummus with fresh veggies instead of pita bread, however. Water crackers also pair well. Avocado Hummus Recipe

 Chicken Shawarma 
 Sunday July 8, 2012 
I have never met anyone who tried shawarma and didn&apos;t like it. It&apos;s a street food, or fast food, that tourists crave after visiting the Middle East and is becoming more popular in larger cities. Most people prefer chicken or beef, but my favorite is chicken shawarma.

I often receive a lot of emails about how to make shawarma at home. I have to be honest; it&apos;s hard to replicate at home. Shawarma meat is slow cooked on a shawarma spit for several hours before serving. Plus, the meat is sold to the vendors in large cones -- something you can&apos;t exactly buy at your local supermarket. However, you can make it at home with my chicken shawarma recipe. It comes very close to street vendor shawarma and is probably the closest you will get at home, short of buying a shawarma spit!

 How to Grill Mushrooms 
 Sunday July 8, 2012 
Grilled mushrooms are delicious! I have known people who despised mushrooms, but tried them grilled and loved them. There is something about the grill that brings out their flavor. I usually grill portobello mushrooms, especially for my vegetarian friends. They are meaty and when seasoned properly can actually be called a &quot;vegetarian steak&quot;.

What I love most about grilled mushrooms is that they are easy to prepare and don&apos;t take a lot of space on the grill. I love to top them on a burger or even eat them plain. Try this grilled mushroom recipe today !
