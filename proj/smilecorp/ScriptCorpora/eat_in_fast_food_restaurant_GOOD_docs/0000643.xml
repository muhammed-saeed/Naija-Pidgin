 Bring back the Blt tacos. Bacon cheeseburger burritos. And the chicken club burritos. This will double tacos bells income within 6 months then send me royalties for making you #1. 



 Unimpressed 6/8/12 
 The taco bell in Parkersburg west Virgina is the worst I have ever been to. The manager (Rossie) is rude and doesn&apos;t care if u didn&apos;t get what u ordered. He also took my burrito said he made me a new one and gave me back the same burrito I gave him. The most horrible customer service I have ever encountered. Warning never go to this horrible taco bell and this is coming from a person who LOVES taco bell. 



 David Behrens 6/12/12 
 Bring back the 3 cheese melt from the 90&apos;s 



 Debbie 6/12/12 
 We miss Taco Bell! 2 area Taco Bells have closed! We are in the business area in Addison, IL. Both the Addison and Villa Park, IL stores have closed! Any chance of one reopening?
The store in Addison was always busy (during the day anyway) and we don&apos;t quite understand why it closed. They were very friendly and my office went 2-3 times per week.
Please let us know any chance of another Taco Bell opening in Addison IL.
Bensenville, IL is the closest to us and it is too far to drive to bring lunch back to the office (warm anyway).
Thank you!
 



 Josh Hinkle 6/12/12 
 hi my name is josh hinkle. and i ve been going to the taco bell at 206 Wears Valley Road, Pigeon Forge TN 37863 and that location has the worse people who prepare and make the tacos in tennessee. They do not put in enough meat,heck they dont put the right amount of meat at all. also they dont put enough meat in the nachos bell grande too.

they have the wore workers who are not friendly and that store is the worse place to go to in east Tennessee and im not giving my business to them no more.

ill go eat at other locations in east tn but that place has lost my business. 



 Joey 6/12/12 
 Can you please make a Flaming Hot Cheetos taco?
Sincerely the drunk guy watching Nba Championship 



 x worker 6/19/12 
 I worked at taco bell and i quit because they would tell us to clock out and keep on stocking even if it was just ten mins or less thats illegal! i went to go get my last check and the F**king manager didn&apos;t want to give it to me idk what to do.
 



 Alexandra Smith 7/2/12 
 My mom and I waited in the drive thru line in Bellefonyaine, Ohio for over 25 minutes and it was Rediculious the wait. I&apos;m never going to another taco bell again. I wa like no one knew what they were doing at all. Terrible service.

 Taco bell has really disappointed me. I ordereda gordita crunch ate about half of it. then gota bite that wasnt right. I spit out to find a piece of plastic bag in my taco!!! And all they said was &quot;o must have been a piece of the lettuce bag.&quot; 



 6/23/12 
 Horrible customer service, the store had 9 customers eating inside and when we are half way done with our food the employee asked us all to leave because it was 11. She said she would call the cops on us for finishing our burritos. -jake 



 JEwing 6/25/12 
 On multiple occasions I have gone through the drive thru in this location (Redwood St in Vallejo, CA) and find that your team members working the drive thru window seem to try to rip you off out your change. Different members at different times. Are you not paying these kids enough that they have to rip off your customers? She tried to short me a dollar bill and she knew what she was doing. She knew damn well cause she tried to distract me then took FOREVER to come back to the window to see what I wanted. I have been shorted at Mc Donalds, Wendys and now twice at your taco bell. So I always count my change. Every time!!!I have told everyone I know what goes on there in that driveway and they have experienced the same. What the hell is the managements problem? They cant get any good honest, trust worthy employees? Cause if there ripping your customers off, I could only imagine what they have taken of yours.JUST A THOUGHT!!! Neither I nor my family will be going to that taco bell ever again.

 very upset customer 6/25/12 
 Went to taco bell after a long day at work..ordered my food,asked for no onions because I&apos;m allergic assuming since I&apos;m allergic they wouldn&apos;t be in there...called.to.speak to the manager because while being in the drive thru the employees were really rude and grumpy can see if they worked a.long day but you do not treat your customers like this...so I call to complain to the manager and she was just as rude times ten,had an attitude and I&apos;m a manager my self you don&apos;t ever talk to your customers like this she was rude and hung up on me...nice customer service especially from a manager. 



 ashley 6/29/12 
 I just went to what use to be my fav tb but i was sadden when i had to wait 30 mins for my food but still could not wait to eat what i have been craving then i became very angry when my nachos had nothing but broken chips to where i had to eat them with a spoon, then my boyfriends and mine burritos had really nothing in them the taco shells were broken and to top it all off they did not even have mild packets i can say i will never step foot back in to the taco bell 4703 66th st n kenneth city fl 33709.
 



 6/29/12 
 I was in Taco bell the other day and i felt the service okay but what really bothered me was how another crew member was being treated by a fellow crew member the girl who was being rude was named Aubrey and she was very rude and snobby towards crew members I was offended for all of the crew members she was talking to. I will not be coming back to that store unless something is done. 



 jodie 6/30/12 
 We have 1 Taco Bell in Arcadia Florida and in the 2 years I&apos;ve been here it&apos;s gotten worse and worse. Today we went and ordered 2 chicken fresco soft tacos and a bean burrito and the total was not what it should have been according to the drive thru menu so I said something and the child working the window said that that&apos;s what the computer put for the price....After taking my husband to work and going back to inquire more we discover the drive thru board priced the tacos 30 cents cheaper than the inside board....Well for $1.59 I will no longer be purchasing fresco chicken tacos. The manager looked like he was still in high school and had no clue as to how to handle the situation and even stated that he had an email about the same issue before. I&apos;m assuming it never occured to him to check the drive thru sign because he changed it as soon as I left. There&apos;s no one but children working there, at night it takes forever in the drive thru. 10 minutes when there&apos;s only 2 cars in front of you is unacceptable. This is a small poor town...and a 30 cent price increase on a taco is ridiculous so you know. Also you really shouldn&apos;t place the responsibility of being in charge of a restaurant and crew on the shoulders of children. We&apos;re done with the Arcadia Taco Bell unless you make some much needed changes.

 C.S. 5/20/12 
 I LOVE my taco bell in Minden Louisiana!
They always get my order right and in a reasonable time frame.
Only complaint I have is the employees being rude in their drive thru.
You can say thank you and they won&apos;t even acknowledge you speaking to them.
They never ask what kind of sauce you want, it&apos;s always a surprise.
Other than that, their great. Everyone is always working and the store is always clean. 



 Zmiller 4/24/12 
 You guys need to put the beefy crunch burrito on the menu for your franchises across the U.S you guys just cant get millions of americans addicted to your blend of cheeses and rice AND hot fritos to rip it out of their lives with no warning... I guess what im really saying here ladies and gents is this is bullshit.. I know it america sure as hell knows it and what were both wondering is how your gonna make this right... Bring the beefy crunches back across the board and sell them fresh off the griddle for $.50 



 jason finland 4/17/12

 Mad customer 4/8/12 
 I live in Arcadia, Florida and have gone to our towns only Taco Bell for years, most of the time they get my order correct but today they left me very digusted with their store. I sent my husband to pick up dinner and all I wanted was a burrito with chicken, rice, and beans they said they can&apos;t make that because it&apos;s not on the menu. My husband came home and told me and asked me if there was anything ells I wanted so I asked him to get a grilled stuft chicken burrito no cheese, no chipotle, and no sour cream if they put it on and extra chicken. Everything was fine until they told him the burrito was $12.00. What, how would that b possible when the burrito itself is $3.89 and the extra meat is no more than a $1.60? I will not be going back to that taco bell The employees there have always been rude and you wait forever to get your order even when they arn&apos;t busy.

 store 021238 in ortonville, mi......wow where do I start it was the most irritating visit and will NEVER go.back to that place. order food and first tells me the mt dew is out then tells me they r out of tomatos so all the supreme things ordered will not have tomatoes how are u a place that serves taco items and run out of tomatoes, and charge for all supreme things which the only thing added was sour creme. get up to the window and wait for a long time while the girl is talking and staring at the computer, never gets our drinks that whole time made us wait while she got that after we got the food acted like no big deal. we check our food everything is wrapped in the correct packing that we ordered open stuff up to not have the right thing for a couple different things and one missing thing that we were all charged for.things not right were cheaper then what we got.just plain ignorant people working really how hard can it b to look at a screen and put it in the bag.dont ever go there unless u want ur stuff messed up and half out of things they should have. 



 Concerned Customer 2/28/12 
 I have seen people being mistreated in the work place, but Taco Bell in Kingdom City, Missouri takes the cake. It is pretty bad when managers disrespect and talk to their employees like they are stupid. Especially when they are constantly picking at certain employees. Eventually I hope this leads up to a law suit because a manager is someone that you expect to run the store and their head is so swollen that certain employees are mistreated in front of customers, and in the work place.


 



 Athena 2/28/12 
 I bought the box of 10 tacos. Each taco had 5 or less pieces of shredded cheese and approximately only 1 teaspoon of meat. There was hardly any lettuce at all. All the stuffing for a single taco could have fit easily into a tablespoon. This will be the last time I go to Taco Bell. This happens every single time we go there, but we keep giving them chances. No more.

 Store# 003324, 9449 Colerain Ave, this is and has been for a while, the worst taco bell. Last time i was there i waited at the drive thru so long that the line went all the way back to the entrance. People began pulling out of the line and leaving, as this was happening you could see the kids in there laughing it up. I ordered extra cheese on my burritos and basicly got a rolled tortilla with nothing in it. Order#354 08-feb-2012. I will never eat there again, and debating on avoiding kfc and pizza hut as well! 



 Shez 2/19/12 
 Horrible. Tacos had no meat on it. Food was still frozen. No customer service. Will see about corporate 



 sadly dissapointed 2/19/12 
 Bought 3 $5 dollar boxes and haven&apos;t received even one box to attempt the PS vita giveaway. From the looks of it, the codes have probably all been claimed. 



 megamanax7@sbcglobal.net 2/20/12 
 Taco Bell on 5th Street in Tyler, T.X. Bought a $5 box. Food was good but the code for the Vita Sweepstakes was already used. I&apos;m guessing someone is texting the codes while on work or something. I have no Idea but just wanted to inform. 



 Angel 2/17/12 
 How are you supposed attempt 2 win a contest if the codes on the $5 boxes have all been used..i think the employees are txting in the codes while they are working...the codes are right on top so they can easily be used b4 the box leaves taco bell. How pathetic!!! 



 former taco bell fanatic 2/17/12 
 At a visit to taco bell to day our lunch was sadly ruined by the fact that employee was fired a couple of booths down from us, is there no back room or an office where this can happen. The funny thing was all the managers would say is how the kid does nothing right. I doubt he is the reason for a half our wait with no one in line. This is the worst taco bell I have been to. The reasons they had for firing him should have everyone there looking for a job. 



 Robert 2/14/12 
 I recently went throught the drive-thru at the Taco Bell in shepherdsville, KY and they were amazing. I ordered two twelve packs and some other food. I figured i would be waiting a while since i ordered so much but it didnt take long at all and all of the food was made correctly. Also the cashier was so nice and polite. I didnt catch her name but she had blue hair and a few tattoos. I know people look down on that sort of things but if everyone is that nice they need to start hiring more people like her!!! i give this store a 10 out of 5!!!!!!! 



 Aaron Brunning 2/14/12 
 I unlocked the box and have been chasing this for three weeks and now they tell me this is not a winning code bs I just see things this is coverup I&apos;m getting the local media after this .You will be embarssed over this. 



 Ellen 2/15/12 
 I went to the Taco Bell near Belleview and Federal in the Denver Metro Area. I wanted to order 5 chicken soft tacos but with a hard shell (my teenage son needs to be gluten free). The manager told me that she would have to charge me extra because she had to account for the extra flour tortillas and the use of the corn taco shells. Then she said that she didn&apos;t even have to make it for me because there were no chicken hard shell tacos on the Taco Bell menu! I have been to Taco Bells all around the country and this is the first Taco Bell that wouldn&apos;t accommodate my son&apos;s dietary needs.

What kind of policy is this??? Do you really think that paying $8.00 (plus tax) for 5 tacos is worth it should be met with such unreasonableness. Plus the corn hard shell is less expensive to serve than a flour tortilla AND chicken is less expensive than ground beef. Do you really want to become known as the people who won&apos;t help those on restricted diets.

SHAME ON YOU TACO BELL!

Cobwebs found in corners and ceiling with insects attached. Outside-broken glass, garbage, and other debris litter the parking lot. Protect your health!-Avoid this location. 



 Rich 2/13/12 
 Hello I&apos;m going to use the name rich ,
Hi I&apos;m 31 years old and I&apos;ve worked in retail for
13 years.
My wife loves taco bell and I&apos;m a big fan
Of a lot of your menu .
Today me and wife stopped in one of your locations
and I noticed there was a change game for
Donations and if you land a certain coin on
a winning slot then you win a prize with
Is a food prize from the menu.
I won! I took a picture to show off on my facebook !
Lol and I used a quarter so it was luck .
So I told the lady behind the counter that I won.
She looked at me and the game and said &quot; oo
you won &quot; I said yes I think a burrito ,
she never showed her gave again and we
even ate there for about 20 min .
It&apos;s just a burrito I get it , but it was also my money
that I choose to play the game and donate
it to a great cause , kinda like gambling
except that this game didn&apos;t hold up to
it&apos;s end of the bargain .
but the most angering part about it was that
it seemed that a she gave free food to a
friend or employee that was there just before
we got there cause she called him by his
named and like wise him to her
then they talked as if they were friends .
it was obvious they knew each other .
I think next time I will pass threw the drive thru
and avoid the inside diner or just pass thru
And choose other fast food restaurants. Thank you 

 

 getting scammed by Taco Bell 2/11/12 
 Bought a $5 box to try to win a Vita and when we got home and put the code in online it immediately came back Error: Code had already been used!! The code is right on top of the box in plain view for all employees to see and apparently that is exactly what they are doing. What a scam. Just like others have said. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM

 I use your nutrition calculator to assist soldiers in meal selection at your restaurants but recently found out your calculator doesn&apos;t work. Your customers use this resource now. Why would you remove it? Please reconsider your actions. 



 not the happyest c.h.a.m.p 2/10/12 
 ok i have worked at taco bell for almost 5 months in the past year of 2011. Sceanse i have been out of work for about two years i was super exsited to get back to work. untile. about 4 weeks ago i get a call from my maniger that my lead maniger/ part owner felt that he would have the nices lady to tell me that im no longer on the scedual for this or nex week. i asked her if she knew why this was and she really had no anser. in the last month in a halfbefor being &quot;let go&quot; i was cut hours from 25 to 6 hours now take this in mind we get paid ones every 2 weeks so you do the math i make 3 hours a week. thats not the worst part i would have to say that the worse part is seeing ellegal imagernts about 4 or five make solery and the same amount of hours as a maniger. But a leagl hard working american man cant get more then a few hours a week. whats unfortunitly is that i have always loved taco bell seance i was 6 i love the look of a taco the taset and the sause but the experianse i got from that new taco bell in dallis Ga i hate to say but i will be boycoting it as of now and if any residents in the area fell like my story got to them or you just thank that what they have done to me pluse many other employes was and is wrong then join me in boycoting this one on nathen dean hy in dallis Ga thank you all. 



 Ashley 2/8/12 
 I went to taco bell this past sunday and the employees made my day. I was in Tampa Fl went to the one on bearrs it was around one or almost two a.m. The blonde cashier was all smiling and nice to me, and the short black guy handed me my food and was nice and had a great smile not sure his name but he had a gold tooth. I was pleased with how quickly they had me pay and I received my food, I&apos;m coming to that taco bell mOre often! 



 michelle kaio 2/8/12 
 My husband , myself and our friend went to taco bell tonight I was not really wanting to go after the first incident where they told us they did not have enough hamburger meat made up to do our order. Tonights incident was much worse we ordered the grande meal all burritos with meat added they charged us 60 cents more per burrito I do not mind paying if the food is fresh but it wasn`t the burritos were old , they were sticking to the wrappers , the beans were sour and they were rude to boot . I also ordered a nachos bell grande&amp;3 beefy crunch burritos the nachos were cold the beans were old and it was not a nachos bell grande it was a plate with a few chips , some cold beans, and some cheese . T he beefy crunch burritos were no better I had to toss it all out and go find something else to cook for supper. I wasted $ 24.15 for food to throw in the garbage.Last time I complained to someone about the quality at this store it did no good we will not be going there again and we have friends who will refuse to go as well. 



 Watch your Debit cards 2/6/12 
 I went to taco bell at 8:05 tonight to get my kids dinner in Fountain. The cashier is talking to his friend while he has my debit card in his hand. Then the cashier sets my card down on the counter. So I sit up to see what is taking him so long to give it back to me. He has his cell phone in between the cash registers texting. After he is done then he decides to give me my card. So I asked the girl at the pick up window if they are allowed to have phones back there . She said &quot;NO&quot; and apologized repeatedly for how it unconvinced me. She offered to give me some cinnamon twist for the cashiers error. I advise her do what you want. She stated that she will let her manager know. I said well I want him or her to call me. The manager came to the window as well as the cashier. I confront him on what he was doing , of coarse he denied everything.Told him Ive been in the banking business for some time. If anything happens to my checking account. I will sue this company for everything it is worth. They have made me very uncomfortable to ever go to their place. Im disgusted how unprofessional they were. I will make sure I spread the word on the horrible experience I received. Now I had to close my card out of the safety for my family.

PS: Stop hiring immature teenagers 



 denise 2/7/12 
 I was surprised during my last visit to the Middle River, MD store when I was informed I had to pay $.49 extra to order a Baja Beef Chalupa....is the sauce worth that much?
Methinks not. 



 Jo Ann 2/7/12 
 Toco bell in Apple Valley CA. .... They have been charging for onions, give me a break, I have been going to this toco bell for ten years and never been charged to put six or seven little peices on onion on a toco, until now ........ Forty cents then tax on that.... Now when I am in the area and want to stop and eat, guess what the first thing I think about is oh no, I will go across the street to eat !!! Really onions a charge just how low down and cheep can this store get !!! I have watched this store get more and more RUN DOWN as time go&apos;s by, really before the onion thing I did not go In as much as I used to, and the damn dirty DOPERS that work their make me not so willing to stop and spend my money, I wonder just how well my food is made, the place is always so dirty, and smells bad.... So if this is a trend to come a charge for onions, looks like I will become a del toco fan, and this hurts me as I have been a fan of toco bell ONLY for about FORTY YEARS .... Jo ann. 



 dorothy@alaska.net 2/7/12 
 Do the corporate offices now allow solicitaions of money from your customers? I stopped for a Tostado and if I could have afforded a drink I would have ordered one. Your employee was told by management to ask the customers if they would like to donate a dollar to the local Providence Hospital. The hospital has a lot more money than I have as they keep expanding with new beautiful buildings all over the place. It is embarrassing to have to say no to the nice young man. This happened at the Muldoon Taco Bell in Anchorage, Alaska I don&apos;t need these Toatados so bad that I will put up with this at the window. It ruined my enjoyment of the lunch. 



 Cora Frazier 2/5/12 
 I am considering the purchase of prime commercial property in my Town and would like to know how to go about getting a Taco bell business here. I can be reached through email at lfgoeson09@gmail.com Thank you

Welcome, NC 



 won&apos;t eat there again... 2/5/12 
 I went to the taco bell on colorado boulevard in pasadena california today. I ordered the 5 buck box in order to enter the sweepstakes they were offering. when the food came not only did I not receive a box but they scattered all my food on 1 tray. needless to say I wont be coming back. I want the code I paid for! 



 elizabeth 2/3/12 
 I had a very bad experience at the taco bell( 1134 william d tate grapevine tx 76051) when i took my two.baby boys to eat and i.found the manager and one employee smoking weed outside of the restaurant.. I talk to the general manager about this and she didnt do anything about it bacause they still work there 



 Elizabeth Witt 2/4/12 
 I sent my son to TacoBell last night to get 5 dollars boxes he ordered 8 and figured he would have to wait a while being as it was Friday night. After making his order the girl at the register told &quot;him pretty much everyone in here hates you right now.&quot; Now as my mama bone has been kicked who do I need to call? We&apos;ve tried calling big orders in before and no one answered.
 



 Ethel Nylund 2/4/12 
 MY biggest complaint is the cleanliness of the store in Portsmouth Ohio. The inside needs cleaned and the outside is just trashy, don&apos;t they have someone to sweep the trash from the lot and from the drivethru? How can they expect customers to not see the dirt and filth that litters the drivethru. Clean it up Taco Bell. 



 Jimmy silver 1/29/12 
 I always go to taco bell 25002 Blue Ravine road in folsom. It was 9:00 p.m I ordered 10 soft Tacos.I think the employee was stoned and very disrespectful. I have encountered this problem few times and I dnt know how store manager runs the store, the store was ver dirty.The tortilla was hard, It was D grade beef. I am very unhappy with this store, I will never coem to this store agian. The meat was very little and they it was not spread along with the tortilla, the lettuce was stsle and there was hardly any cheese. I will contact about this to the director, D.M and owner regarding this situation. The store manager is siera and she did not help me with this circumtances. I would rate this store negative ten(-10).

Please convey this message to the owner Dave fulwille. 



 Dissatisfied 1/29/12 
 I bought the $5 box, and when I got home and finished eating, I decided I&apos;d text the code to enter the sweepstakes I saw advertised. It&apos;s petty that someone from taco bell would steal the code number off of the box so the customer who paid for the product doesn&apos;t get the chance to enter it. What I mean is, when I entered the code, the website told me that code had already been entered. I&apos;m not really mad, I&apos;m just diss appointed. In the future, I think taco bell should use a sticker (like McDonald&apos;s monopoly), instead of printing the codes where they are visible to anyone who handles them before the consumer, since the honor system doesn&apos;t work. 



 1/29/12 
 I wish I could give taco bell a zero how are you sopose to use 1 sause for two tacos. Use some comen sence when we get a 12 pack how about 12 sauce&apos;s at least. For shame taco bell is riping pepol off 



 Dr Benjamin 1/26/12 
 Your staff at the location at the Gateway Center in Grimsby Ontario is the best!!!

I was so amazed at how freindly and courteous cheerful and helpful the staff all were when I went to pick up my 80 order for my kids!
Receipt # C30668045-001-219-060-0
424 South Service Road Grimasby Ontario.

This store staff deserves any awards you can offer them.

Keep up the amazing work!

Customer service means everything!

I will continue to drive out of my way to buy from this location.

Thanks!!! 



 Brad 1/27/12 
 This scam with the iPad seems to just be trying to collect marketing info. I would like to see a list of winners, but they don&apos;t seem to exist even at the link for &quot;list of winners&quot;. Tried to contact Taco Bell and they don&apos;t take calls, but rather have a robot phone to hang up on you. DON&quot;T FILL OUT THE SURVEY FOR THE IPAD.....IT IS A SCAM!!!! 



 1/28/12 
 LOL...Taco bell is gross.. I stopped going to the one on Grenada Blvd in Ormond Beach, Fl due to how rude all the workers were and unsanitary. After about 6 months.. I thought I would try again and this nice lady was there and the crew was different and different manageres (it&apos;s a training taco bell)... so I put in a compliment for this nice lady after visiting there several times and her always being personalble and helpful. I told her I did so and next time I see her, she tells me thanks and that since I wrote that the crew before (&quot;all teenagers with attitudes and no manners&quot;) she said they disregarded the feedback and told her that the person who wrote it just didn&apos;t like teenagers!

LOL... Too funny. older people (this woman is about 60) are better mannered, aren&apos;t usually dopers (like the kids that where there before ) and actually treat others with respect. Soooo, my point: WHY DO YOU ASK FOR FEEDBACK IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT???

Keep hiring scumbags and watch the store close completely LOL... it&apos;s so dead in there now, not sure how you&apos;re not understanding what the cause is!!!

Hire more people with respect and see a difference.. Everyone goes to Moes down the road and pay 4 times as much for a burrito because of the service... 

 

 1/28/12 
 didn&apos;t change the stars at top for my review just put in.. of course it&apos;s set at 5... Taco bell ... stop asking for feedback when you clearly don&apos;t want the real ones... setting the rating at 5 stars? give me a break...

signed,
Happy to pay quadruple at Moes for better service and cleanliness. 



 Sharon 1/24/12 
 I was in the Dinuba&apos;ca taco bell to buy a gift cert..the girl at the register didn&apos;t know how to do it and asked another employee and she didn&apos;t either,so they call a manager out of the back to help..the manager that came out was rude and never once made eye contact with me and was pissed off because she had to help me..not once did I get a hello,may I help you or a thank you at the end...as a rule this place has always been helpful and nice but this day everone was VERY rude..I think I will NOT go back there!!!!!!!!!! 



 tacobell worker 1/24/12 
 taco bell is a wonderful place it is my first job and the greatess job we all work hard to give our customers great service, and have fun doing...i say that evryone should come share a taco at tacobell bring a friend

 WTF 1/22/12 
 OMG THEY WERE TERRIBLE EVERY TACO BELL SUCKS I HATE THEM
DIRTY PEOPLE
ONE MAN WAS TALKING IN SPANISH DUMB FUCK AND THEN BENT OVER
AND TOOK A
BIG
SHIT IN MY FOOD OMG
AND THEN I ATE IT BECAUSE I WAS SO FUCKING HUNGRY
AND THEN GOT SICK WTF SO I CAME UP TO THE COUNTER
AND CAUSED A SCENE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL SECOND CLASS
CITIZENS AND I DEMANDED
A REFUND
AND I SAW IN THE BACK THAT THE MANAGER WAS
HAVING SEX IN HER OFFICE WITH THE FIRST GUY
WTF BUT I WAS HUNGRY AND DEATHLY WEAK I HAD TO EAT IT
ITS NOT MY FAULT I WANT A REFUND AND
MORE FREE FOOD THAN WHAT I PAID FOR
THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. 



 Can&apos;t Believe 1/22/12 
 I&apos;m complaining about Taco Bell on Spokane Southhill at 29th Avenue. The workers there behave very poorly including the manager with no customer service manners. They do no care about their customers or even pretend to care.
I&apos;ve never like Taco Bell, but now I&apos;m NEVER going to Taco Bell.

By the way, on your Taco Bell website under Contact Us, the word verification is misspelled. Really? a big corporation like you can&apos;t spellcheck before uploading? It kind of shows the professional manner from the corporate office too. Very sad. 



 I got Ambushed. 1/20/12 
 I have never experince this at any fastfood chaine. BESIDES TACOBELL. I went inside had my 2 young children with me just move in the area. I was at TacoBELL In Edinburgh Indiana on rt.31 Told BOBBIE chashier My order was all chicken order, which I order all the time. Because I dont like thire beff it upset my stoamch. any way I got 2 beff buritios which NEVER game out my mouth, and Bobbie the cashier said I had to pay more money for the chicken tacos that I thought I had order and already paid for.17.49 was my total. I told her this is not right you messed my order up. and I never even left the counter with the food and told her to take BACK the Burritos I didn&apos;t order this. She told me they could not take them back. then the manger named KYLIE said to me rudley with dirty looks we dont give out free food! What the hell? I never once asked for free food she just called me a lier and they treated me really bad. mind you I never onces disrespected anyone. So I said to her I payed for my food you messed my order up. Then Kylie manger asked me to leave, They never once tryed to work this out with me. I have never been treated to awful and I will be doing something about it. I threw away the burritos at tacobell also payed more tax for IN DINING wich I did not stay and after 17.49 I payed I still had no dinner for me. This is totally wrong, I was and am A honest customer. I have been really upset about this. been having tenision headace and been crying over how I got treated. something has to be done! Is thier a good lawyer out there that knows the next step to take? If so write your name and number on this web site. 



 To those of you filling this out thinking they read it... 1/16/12 
 They don&apos;t. This is for everyone else to look at, and laugh at... Taco Bell is epically awesome, however it doesn&apos;t seem to matter, you can always count on idiotic customers wanting free shit because they are mad about too much lettuce on the wrong side of the sandwich, whats wrong with you people? Really? HA Are you so fat and lazy that you decide that it&apos;s OKAY to be mean to someone just because of the simple things that inconvenience you? Why not thank the person for making your food for you before throwing food at them? If an employee has a &quot;customer service problem&quot; it&apos;s likely they&apos;ve had to deal with fat lazy jerk offs for too long. You are all a bunch of ass holes and you should be forced to work in fast food... Because faking a smile for minimum wage is really totally worth putting up with bullshit, why not be nice to a person even if they aren&apos;t nice to you because those are the ones that need it most.
On a different note, Taco Bell has awesome foods. 



 Employee 1/13/12 
 Taco Bell is not the spawn of satan, its normal people working a normal fast food job. People don&apos;t understand the strain put on the employees on a daily basis. Rude customers, people wanting freebies, people being assholes for no reason. I&apos;m a very good worker and I perform my job properly and efficiently. CUSTOMERS are my number 1 priority, and when 20 to 25 of them complain about things that I DON&apos;T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER, and start to get loud with me, I keep my cool, apologize, and do what I can to set it right. I guess the point I&apos;m trying to get across is: Just give the employees the benifit of the doubt, chances are they&apos;ve been yelled at about 15 to 20 times that day already, and they could really use a break. I&apos;m not saying hold your tongue, I&apos;m saying complain in a calm and collected manner. If you blow up on someone, how do you expect them to react to you? 



 Abigail 1/14/12 
 I had never liked Taco Bell until they came out with the chicken flat bread. I said I wanted to try it. When I tried it I fell in love with it. One day I went to Taco Bell to order one and they told me that they had gotten rid of it. I was so upset. I would love it if they would bring it back. If they don&apos;t, then they should concider they have lost a very good costumer.

- Abigail

PS: I came like every other day you know. 



 Consumer 1/14/12 
 I went I to your store in Ashburn,VA on January the 14th and as usual had the worst experience ever. This taco bell has the worst customer service and the worst accurate order fulfillment ever. No wonder this place is always slow. I think the people you hire either make or break a business. Based on the type of employees at this location I&apos;d say this will break the business. I had the pleasure of dealing with the worst kind of (Manager) a business has the pleasure of hiring. I&apos;d say cut him loose and hire someone with a little more personality and common sense. I made a call to the regional and she was no better then him. Would not recommend to anyone. I&apos;d say drive a little further and go to another location because this one sucks. 



 JG 1/11/12 
 I am not complaining about a particular location but rather the scam going on with their survey to win a free iPad.

I took the time to fill out the surgery as its explained on the back of the receipt. Right after I hit enter to send it, up comes a message that I am not eligible to win. WHAT? When I looked at the supposed list of people who have won an iPAD, there are no names listed. This feels like a scam to get people to give them marketing information. What a rip off. They should be investigated. I would love to push this legally but who has the time or money to waste on a piss-ant taco company.

I tried to call Taco Bell to &quot;talk to a taco bell customer service representative&quot;. When I call that number, I get a recording saying they are busy and cannot take my call, then it hangs up on you.

I actually like taco bell food and go there ofter, but after this treatment I am boycotting taco bell and will remind all my friends of this story. Corporate should treat customers with respect, be willing to talk to them, and carry out their survey / sweepstakes professionally. What bunch of losers. They have seen the last dime from me. 



 angel 1/11/12 
 My husband went in to taco bell and ordered. Four of your double xl grilled stuff burrito. Will he was told they did not have enough for 4. Just for two. He said ok. Then he ordered 4 cr-wrp and 2 nbg-bf. When he got home he realized His wife order of two burrito were not there. He went back and the door was locked. They were suppose to be open for at least 45 min more. He came back and called and asked to talk to manager. The women on the phone said she was and said come back and rebuy the burrito and we will give you a drink free to say sorry. They need to get the order right the first time. We should have gotten what we paid for. We will never return to that taco bell again. store number 021082 phone number 951-654-1696. They never have enough for demand. And they get rude with you. What ever happened to the costmer is right. They take your money at the window or walk in and dont give you what you orders. Watch the orders. most not speak english. some other langue know days. 



 Tim 1/9/12 
 I am very concerned about Taco Bells FAULTY ADVERTISEMENT. The 12 for $10 Limited time offer is NOT really $10. The poster clearly states 12 tacos for $10. It does not say 12 hard tacos or 12 soft tacos for $10 ,not even in the fine print on the bottom. I took pictures! When you order the &quot;12 for $10&quot; they all of the sudden charge extra for soft tacos. Not anywhere on that poster does it state that soft tacos will be more!!! This is definetly a clear case of FAULTY ADVERTISEMENT!!! I will pursue this to the fullest because it is illegal and just plain out taking advantage of Taco Bell Customers. If Taco Bells corporate office doesnt fix this, I will do everything in my power to make this right for everyone who is getting ripped off. 



 matt 1/10/12

 Jessica 1/10/12 
 I currently had to press charges for a shift manager assulting me on camera while I was clocking out from my shift. The store manager couldn&apos;t present viable evidence and all of a sudden found witnesses who weren&apos;t even there when the incident occurred. It would be greatly appreciated if corporate could find more respectful managers and crew members. 



 franklin 1/10/12 
 Hi my name is Franklin , father of Franklin Jr. who worked for your company at taco bell located 15201 sw 104th street miami fl 33196 My kid is a minor and he was terminated today 1/10/12 by the District Manager Edgar Rodriguez who accused my kid from stealing from the cashier and being paid off for not telling who was actually stealing. As a Father of a minor, i would like to request and explanation of my kid issue about stealing due to it can damage his future employment process. my kid came crying to me and stated that he hasn&apos;t done such thing and i believe him. i called the district Manager to let him know to call me back. He was screaming to every one on the store who terminated as well the store manager and more employees without any kind of proof. I&apos;m trying to get in contact with HR to let them know this kind of abuse this manager did to my kid. i will contact my attorney to explain this issue if Mr Edgar do not respond to my request due to my kid . Please HR if you read this comment about this issue please, contact me to my e mail franklineo60@aol.com 



 Emily (fort worth tx) 1/8/12

 MAD EMPLOYEE 1/8/12 
 I work at a taco bell, I do not live at a taco bell. I am currently a college student trying to concentrate on my studies. I can&apos;t do that when as soon as my mangers set the schedule out they change it 5mins later. I&apos;m off 2 days a week back to back, so i&apos;m not going to go where I work on my 2 off days. DUH!!!!!! It&apos;s bull and i&apos;m sick of it. The managers need to get their stuff together. It&apos;s ridiculous, I thought you had to ask the person or at least give them a heads up when you change the schedule randomly. The management should not be able to write me up if i miss a day on account that i had no one tell me that the schedule was being changed. That is so irresponsible for a management team to treat their employees that way. It makes us look in the wrong for everything. I&apos;m not going to check my schedule every day to see if it hasn&apos;t been fiddled with in any sort of way. NOOOOO!!!! That is my managers job and my managers job to tell me when they do that. TACO BELL SUCKS MONKEY DICK, THE MANAGERS SUCK, YOUR DRESS CODE POLICY IS A JOKE, YOU TREAT YOUR STAFF LIKE SHIT, MY FIRST DAY OF WORK I DID NOT EVEN GET A HAND BOOK, YOU GUYS ARE THE MOST UNORGANIZED FAST FOOD RESTAURANT EVER MADE. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. THE ONLY REASON YOU WILL EVER BE OPEN IS BECAUSE YOUR FUCKING FOOD IS CHEAP AND YOU SELL BAJA BLAST, OR AS THE CUSTOMERS CALL IT BLUE MOUNTAIN DEW. BURN TACO BELL BURN. 



 unhappy employee 1/6/12 
 working in this hell hole for 2 years now i realized you guys are a bunch of sociopathic jerks. i hate working for you guys because you guys don&apos;t give a crap about your employees. ever hear, happy employees happy customers?????? the reason employees might be rude to the customers is because they are unhappy with the way you guys treat us. okay??/ additionally to my rant, what is the point of being open till 2am??? its stressful extraneous stress. may you guys go out of business. HO HUM. 



 fed up 1/6/12 
 Not looking for freebies or handouts just thought you&apos;d like a helpful review. I have just about sworn off taco bell altogether. I swear it never fails everytime I go to taco bell I never get what I order. For instance, if I order a single order for myself and ask for no tomatoes I always unwrap my taco/ bite into my crunch wrap supreme and low and.behold always tomatoes. If I order multiple meals one of the items if not.all are screwed up, most of the time something is .missing. I don&apos;t understand how hard it is to get an order right. I know it is not just my history of bad luck either, numerous of my friends and family have the same issue. Love your food just sick of the poor service. 

 

 Roger 1/5/12 
 I have made 3 purchases at Taco Bell (Oak Tree Road)in Edison New Jersey in the last several months, I just looked at my Debit account and it shows they submitted all transactions to my BA Debit on Jan 5th 2012..I am glad there is money in my account to cover or there would have been overdraft penelties...Why do they hold these transactions for several months...I may not go to Taco Bell any more!!!! 



 April 1/5/12 
 I am writing about the Taco bell store in Kokomo, Indiana (Store # 023127 3801 S. Reed Rd.) I go to this Taco Bell daily because my family and I are on a special diet and we are able to keep low on the carbs yet still have something tasty. The only time I get my order right is when a manager named Sandy is working. If she is not working my order is WRONG EVERY TIME! I take pictures of the food and call them and of course they just offer me free food and think that it&apos;s ok...IT IS NOT!! I just want my order correct the first time that I order it! I went through the drive thru a while back and I checked my order right there after recieving it and it was wrong and they had over charged me! I told the girl at the window and she was horribly rude to me and was yelling at me. I asked for the manager Erick and he was equally rude! All because they got my order wrong once again and over charged me (The customer...the one that ultimately pays thier paycheck!!) (No customers ... No Taco Bell) I spend on average around $20.00 a day there and sometimes more. I went inside last night to try and make sure that I would get the correct order. I seen Sandy in the back and sais to her &quot; You weren&apos;t working last night were you? Because my order was wrong again.&quot; She said no I was off last night. The girl on the other side of the table making the orders for the front of the store yelled at me and said I was working last night and I KNOW THAT ORDER WAS RIGHT!!! I said Are you calling me a liar?? because I didn&apos;t even order what I normally order because I thought you may get it right if I changed! She continued to yell at me and yell profanities in the restaurant! Another customer came up and told them that she is highly upset because her child is sitting right there and that she does NOT appreciate the language from the employee! Yet the girl kept on yelling them! There was another manager there and when they handed me my food I told them I want my money back for being treated in this manner and having to endure this ....The other manager said &quot;It&apos;s either the food or the money...You are always saying that your order is wrong!&quot; I said &quot; Because it is and I have proven that every time!!&quot; She said no to the refund! I recieved a refund from another manager and I left after talking to the other customer..She told me that she would most definitely be reporting this issue as well! I am going to also post this in all of our local news papers and as many forums and social networks as humanly possible! Why would someone have to be treated this way just because they are spending money at an establishment??? I want the girl and the short manager FIRED!! YOU JUST DO NOT TREAT CUSTOMERS IN THIS MANNER! I may also contact an attorney because I was truly traumatized by this whole situation as was the child sitting in the restaurant having to listen to the screaming and profanities so I hope the other customer contacts her attorney as well! If Taco Bell would fix their problems it might actually be a decent place to eat! From the comments above it looks as if it is common practice for Taco Bells employees to be rude to their customers! The triple steak stack is a JOKE too because the above comment is correct about the false advertizment don&apos;t promise something if you can&apos;t deliver! Taco Bell actually gets 0 stars from me because they don&apos;t even deserve 1 but that is the lowest that you can go on here! 



 Sela 12/31/11 
 The taco bell in wharton tx has a sign that says it opens at 11. The restaurant is closed&amp;the lights are on inside&amp;it is past 11:15. There is no sign stating that the restaurant will be closed. There are other cars driving around trying to get inside. I called the restaurant&amp;there is no answer. I was very upset. 



 Robert 12/22/11 
 Taco Bell in central Indiana has told an employee that they can not say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to their customers or they would be in trouble or terminated. The employees may say &quot;happy holidays&quot;. Really Taco Bell? There is nothing wrong nor illegal with saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; at Christmas time&amp;&quot;Happy New Year&apos;s&quot; at that time. The two holidays are separate entirely&amp;NOT combined! 



 p***** employee 12/23/11 
 I work at Taco Bell in Kentucky. I close 11 pm-5 am. I worked 70 hours in two weeks, but my check came out to 26 hours and $134. I am now unable to pay my rent and my lease is up on the 31st, and now I will be homeless in the middle of winter. I talked to our Store Manager and he refuses to look for and correct the error. The shift leader that called me in all of those nights is threatening to fire me because I&apos;m not letting it go, because I need my money. I have bills just like everyone else. The form that shows all my &quot;clock in-clock out&quot; is very very wrong, but I have never missed a clock in or a clock out. They refuse to check the cameras to see when I was and wasn&apos;t there. Calling corporate office on the 27th, if they refuse, I&apos;m contacting a lawyer. 



 concerned mother 12/19/11 
 My daughter has worked at Taco bell in muscle shoals, Alabama and she almost &quot;got a point&quot; because a lady came through drive thru told her to have a blessed day anod my daughter told her to also have a blessed day she was told if she said that or told any one Merry Christmas she would b fired ... REALLY!!!!! Then they told her yesterday they were having a Christmas party if she wanted to come and play dirty santa so she went she stopped and got a gift with the only $5.00 she had and when one of the managers cursed her for not spending more money on the gift she left ... No.1 she&apos;s a minor and rhis manager for the 2nd or 3rd time now has used very vulgar words to my daughter words such as the f... Word not apropriate language for anyone to use especially someone speaking to minor employees... The girl has one more time and this momma is goin up there my daughter has begged me to let her handle it but one more time that this woman speaks to my child like that ima goin up there!!!!!! Fix Ur employees!!!! Please 



 johnny rivera 12/19/11 
 The past year I have lived here the TacoBell down the road (E street in ChulaVista Vista, CA) has been great and the particular gentlemen that used ti work nights was always pleasant, however, since the new managment i have had nothing but problems. My main concern was when I was hung up on by the female night manager (i believe her name was Maria). I called back several time with no answer. Same thing this week, I have called several times asking for a manager to call me back and have yet to hear back. This is ridiculous. HORRIBLE service not by employees but by MANAGEMENT. 



 neighbor 12/20/11 
 Irving, Texas taxi bell at MacArthur and Shady grove...Do not ever go there its a waste on time and money. Everytime I go even if it is two soft tacos they mess up your order. This time they really messed up and added that Nasty Jalepeno sauce..Big mistake it was fed to a child who started checking on it.... Well there fault because clearly on my receipt it shows that we wanted no sauce...Here goes a big bite outside there buns..Contacted a lawyer...Here comes the call to corporate next...

 Samantha 12/14/11 
 I went into your store in Franklin Park, IL (Rose St&amp;Grand Av.) on Saturday, December 10th and my bill was $21.70. I gave them a 20 dollar bill and told them to the remaining on my debit card. ($1.70) On Tuesday, December 13th I go online to check my bank and I see that they charged the entire bill on my debit card in two separate transactions. One for $20 and another for $1.70. First of all I want to know why this happened? Second, I want to know what happened to my $20 bill? I called the store right away and he told me to bring my statement in and he would give me my $20 back, he did. My only problem is I only had $4.98 in my account that day and with the $20 dose charge, it left me with a negative $15.02. Now, I will be charges overdraft fees and service charge fees from my bank and I feel since this is your fault, I should be reimbursed that money also. This is your employee&apos;s fault and truth me told my $20 bill went right into their pocket that night. My email is Mantha0587@live.com, I would like a response ASAP seeing that Christmas is next week and I was counting that money that my bank is going to take. 



 Matt 12/10/11 
 I have went to two different locations now and before closing when it clearly states the time that the hours are to end at an I was not served 10 min before closing!!! I was even willing to pay double just for my small order. I work in a restaurant and I know it&apos;s not the greatest thing to do but if you have to stay open till a certain time why turn away customers???? Both locations one in land o lakes Florida on sr 54 and then on Cortez in Bradenton Florida ! 



 Tina Jackson 12/8/11 
 12/7/2011 - Went to Taco Bell in Oceanside, CA for lunch. store #017285. The girl at the front (Jasmin Pena) didn&apos;t even look up to say &quot;hello&quot;. After about 2 minutes we finally made eye contact and I just ordered - still nothing from her!!! Then I use the restroom. Every Taco Bell I have been in smells horrible in the bathrooms!! What&apos;s with the odor??? Maybe it is coming from the drain in the floor - it is awful! Nothing but Mexicans speaking Spanish working there! 



 Travis A 12/8/11 
 Ok at first, i eat at Taco bell more 3 three times a week. And this was just horrific, Took my food back to to my place, was eating it. Then in my taco i found a six inch hair in it. I was not to upset about it. Took a pic called the store they put me on hold then hung up on me. Id be more then happy to get a call back. But have not yet. I will call corporate tomorrow, and hope they will make this better for me. From Travis A

 Stephen 12/2/11 
 Is anyone in America other than me getting sick and tired of Taco Bell dividing their commercials in to two 15 second segments that play at the beginning and end of most commercial sets? This &quot;Two for the price of one&quot; format is sickening and has turned me against ever buying food from them. I hope America will join in with me and boycott Taco Bell until this format changes...for the better! 



 Concerned mother of employee 12/1/11 
 My daughter has worked at Taco Bell for 6 years and is a dedicated and conscientious employee that has worked like a dog at any and all hours she&apos;s asked. She just got her benefits not long ago (health, dental and vision). Today she found out that her store is being turned over to a franchise and she will lose all her benefits. It seems that there is no loyalty to your hard-working employees. I have visited my daughter&apos;s store on many occasions and am always proud to see how professional and accommodating she is with her customers. The store is always extremely clean inside and out and it breaks my heart to see her so distressed. I think Taco Bell should be more considerate of the employees being affected when selling their stores. 



 Roger 11/29/11 
 My wife and I went to the Taco bell in SLC located at 7200 S. and I-15. I believe the store number is 005139 (that&apos;s what is on the receipt). We were on our way to the airport. We ordered and after 15 minutes had not received our order. You only had 2 people working. One was handling both the front and the drive-in orders and one person cooking. What a joke!!! Then at 6:40 pm you had 3 more people show up for work. I had no more time to wait or chance missing my plane so asked for my money back. The crew literally laughed at me. No apology, nothing!!! I tried calling the number on the receipt to talk to the store manager directly but it went to a fax machine (how convenient)!! I would like to add, after seeing some of the other postings, WHERE&apos;S THE BEEF!!! I would never go to your restaurant but for some reason my wife likes it (way beyond me)??? It appears that you do not care about your massive number of complaints as you never do anything to correct them. Some day this will bite you in the you know what!! 



 robb akers 11/19/11 
 I went in to taco bell i order my food they gave me my order number then five min later they told me we ran out for meat for your taco&apos;s i asked for my money back and they told me we don&apos;t do that. i asked for an iou so i could come back and they told me u can have a coupon. i asked for a store manager and they call him he said if i didn&apos;t stop disrupting his store he would call the cops.i was doing nothing wrong. all i wanted was my money back are something that said we owe u this amount in our store. i got we can give u a meal that cost 14.00 dollor. i didn&apos;t order a meal. i spent 15.43 so over a 1.43 they want me to say ok i will do that. I left with nothing they kept my money and gave me nothing wow i feel that is bad for a company to do so if someone can help me find a way to get my money back that would b great. not a good deal in my eye&apos;s somthing needs to b done

 Taco Bell. what happened to truth in advertising. The steak on flatt bread shows ten times the amount you truly get. you lost my family&apos;s business. 

 

 some one very pissed 11/12/11 
 I ordered the new triple steak flatbread n xxl.chicken burrito n cinnamon twists to end up going home and not having my flatbread. So I have to drive all the way back and the little kid that made the food is calling me a liar n claiming he made it and put it in the bag.. Why the hell would I drive all the way back for my food I didn&apos;t get and waste my time on rude people. So I look at him n he starts talking in spanish. Hey asshole my husband is mexican and I understand when your talking smack. I will never go back. Seriously find some people who have brains and customer service skills. Where do you find these people. Friends of friends? 



 Linda Summers 11/13/11 
 My husband ordered triple steak wrap and it barely had anything in it. Your advertising is false and misleading. We use to love your food, but you give less and charge more. Shame on you.

 Patty 11/10/11 
 I had put in a order for our youth group at church for 60 Taco&apos;s and 60 burrito&apos;s for a Wednesday night. I called the day before and asked if they could do it for me and they told me yes, so I gave them the order; give them my phone number , credit card number and asked them if they needed any other things so I could pick them up the next day at 6:00p.m. and they told me it would all be ready by 6:00p.m. on Wednesday ( November 2nd). I go to get it and they don&apos;t have anything for me and the manager comes over and tells me he knew about it but they did not fix them because I did not call to remind them to do it. THe manager starts laughing about the problem and not try at all to help me out. I had 15 minutes to come up with something for 60 Youth kids to eat for there supper that night and I feel like this was really bad for them to not do my order like they said they would. 



 Michele Tigner 11/3/11 
 This was the worst meal I ever exprienced from Taco Bell on Mt. Zion in Morrow, store 019785, at 9:30pm on a Thursday night. My husband and I ordered the XXL chalupa combo and got what looked like a soft bread taco. We had to look through to see if meat was actually added to our soft bread taco. The dough wasn&apos;t fried at all and my husband had to reheat leftovers afterwards because he was still hungry. When people go out and spend their hard earned money, they expect to get what they see advertised, not what someone just throws together. We cose this meal because it looked filling. You guys really need to stop with the advertisements of you can&apos;t pull through on your end. This is so deceitful! The service was great, but the food was terrible. That will be my last time spending my money with Taco Bell. EVER!!! 



 Notveryhappy 11/7/11 
 I went to the tacobell on powder springs rd. They just had the worst sutomer service. I was unhappy when i look at the item i purchase and saw my food were just thrown in the bag. The girl in the drive through was very rude and I try to call the Manager that was on duty by the name of Michelle to complain about her associate and she was also rude and hung up in my face. This has been by far the worst taco bell ive ever been to. I tell all my friends and family not to go there anymore. 



 Laura O. 11/2/11 
 I had a great experience at the Parsippany, NJ Taco Bell tonight. Sonia helped us, and I have never been so impressed with an employee as I was with her. She did everything she could to help find my family and I a seat in the crowded restaurant, and was as courteous and accommodating as anyone could possibly be. In the end, we had to take our food out, but we&apos;ll be back! 



 ashley 10/29/11 
 I just came from taco taco bell in lexington kentucky zip code number 40511 off leestown road store number 23156 my order number is 572 the date was 10/29/11 the time was 12:17 I had called back to complain on the woman that took my order she was the same person who gave me my food she had a nasty attitude was very rude the whole timeI called back up there to speak to a manager the manager herself was very rude I am very upset because of the way she is running her business she is not satting a good example for the other employee. the manager hung up on me before she hung up on me she told me to call a 1 800 number on the back of the receipt it did not help me anyway just to see if I want a chance to play in win 1000 dollars I&apos;m a kindergarten Sunday school teacher at greater faith apostolic I would never go to that taco bell again I will be sure to let everyone know about about how they acted 



 Elizabeth Boozer 10/29/11 
 I am actually having a VERY hard time even giving this Taco Bell location a rating of 1! This was the worst service, manners, common courtesy, respect, cleanliness and food I have EVER experienced all at once in any type of public eatery.

My friend and I stopped in for what we thought would be a quick bite at the Taco Bell in Middleburg Hts Ohio. It was 11:oopm on a Saturday evening. Not alot of customers yet, fairly early for midnight rush. There were a few customers that had already been served and were sitting at tables talking, and two in line in front of me waiting for their food. I noticed the weird looks that the couple waiting kept giving each other and wondered why. That question was answered real quick when the cashier finally came up to take our order. This mid 50&apos;s gentleman was greeting us by saying (and I quote) &quot;I accept 50&apos;s and 100&apos;s! Lady&apos;s first!&quot; (even though it was only 2 females there!) He proceeds to ramble a mile a minute failing to even ask us what we wanted. When he eventually did, every time I went to say what I wanted, he would cut me off with a dumb comment about the party he was attending that night and how he PROMISES he will NOT be sober!!! Then he apologized for being so &quot;WEIRD&quot; and blamed it on all the LSD he has taken in his life!
I looked around to find the manager and found a young man looking as if he just climbed out of bed, uniform filthy and very sloppily dressed helping the kitchen workers. They all looked as if they were busy working and frantically slapping food together trying to make it look eatable! I watched a young man who ended up being as strange as the cashier, grab what looked like a caulk gun and squirt sour cream on a soft taco. Only he spit a glob onto the wrapper, not the taco. So he used his hand to spread it across the top.
In the 8 minutes we stood there, we began to notice how FILTHY the floors were, behind the counter and in the dinning area. And our food ended up looking NOTHING like what it was we ordered. Two BIG steak Chalupas and two soft tacos. I was not thrilled to see that it was MY taco he had wiped the sour cream across.
I WILL NOT BE RETURNING and am calling the health department!

 First of all, where is the corporate email address on this site? I thought corporate websites were meant for people to be able to easily access information...guess I was wrong. After dealing with the geniuses I encountered tonight at the taco bell on Kemp Street in Wichita Falls, Tx, I am ready to pull my hair out. Now, in their defense, every time I visit the location, the order is wrong. Maybe it was naive of me to think that maybe they could do me right just this one time. I thought wrong. The ONLY thing right on my ENTIRE order was my drink. Wow. I ordered steak quesodillas...got chicken, and got a fully loaded taco after asking for one with meat and cheese only. Now, I know this email will do absolutely nothing, but I thought it important for those in charge to at least get a chance to hear what they&apos;re doing wrong. After calling them 4 times in a row, I finally had someone answer the phone claiming they&apos;re a manager. She couldn&apos;t do shit for me, as I&apos;m sure you won&apos;t be able to. Thanks for reading my long rant...I wish there were more positive things to say. I&apos;ll stick to taco bueno from now on, where their employees are coherent enough to fulfill my order. 



 POISIONED TODAY AT TACO BELL 10/25/11 
 I just spent $5 on a combo meal #1 and it was so ROTTEN tasting and stinking that I couldn&apos;t even eat it. I took ONE bite out of the taco and instantly THREW UP! I threw the entire meal OUT as the meat and condiments were ROTTEN tasting and SMELLED like the meat was weeks old, not accounting for the horrible smelling lettuce too. Where did they get their ingredients in the GARBAGE? OMG, can&apos;t they tell it STINKS and will poison someone. I will NEVER eat at a TB AGAIN after today!!! 



 not happy customer 10/24/11 
 Why do you make the xxl so big on tv and claim this to big huge? Weve went several times and the shell wasn&apos;t even close to half full... very disappointed. Wont be back for that anymore...

 The advertized price for the chicken flat bread samwitch is $0.99 thruout the country which I saw this morning on TV. Today for lunch I went to a local Taco Bell in Greensboro, NC and they told me that the price is $ 1.39. They said read the fine print. Well, there is no FINE PRINT in the TV advertizement. The justification is the $0.99 is for corporate office. What the hell is that. In my opinion Taco Bell is simply Cheaters, Fraud.......

 On 10/21/11 at about 3:30pm we went to our local Taco Bell (store # 022020 ) in Pueblo, Colorado. We placed our order and as usual, the order came back incorrect. Then I found a large piece of bone in my chicken flatbread sandwich. I complained to the manager about it, and they managed to do the very least they could do. It was almost an inch long, I was actually choking on it, and completely dissatisfied. They kept the bone, but offered to replace my sandwich. WOW! Don&apos;t put yourself out. I also called the corporate office, and guess what. They listened and offered to pass the message back to the same monkeys that ignored me to begin with. I didn&apos;t expect much, yet somehow they still managed to disappoint me. Perhaps you should train monkeys to run your restaurants, they couldn&apos;t be any less caring. The customers in line behind me were shocked by the lack of caring they showed me.

 A few weeks ago, my son&apos;s mother got hungry and against my better judgement I decided to go to Taco Bell. It was about midnight and the lobby was closed. When I pulled up to the order box, I gave my order, three tacos and a been&amp;beef burrito. I had to repeat myself at least eight times because the person on the other end couldn&apos;t understand and get it wright. The entire time I could hear laughter in the background. Then my wallet fell to the floor and I was trying to find it in the dark. The voice on the other end told me to pull to the window. I told them, &quot;just a minute, I&apos;m looking for my wallet&quot;. They told me again. And I responded again. They yelled at me to pull to the window seven times and I responded, seven times. The entire time laughter in the background. Each time I answered them, I got more upset and answered louder. Each time the laughter got louder as well. Then she told me to pull to the window one last time before I lost my temper. Tired of being taunted and laughed at, I told them, &quot; Hold The F--K on.&quot; I found my wallet and finally pulled to the window. The lady at the window refused to take my money and fill my order. I asked for the manager. She said she was the manager. She was rude and told me she didn&apos;t appreciate the language. I told her I didn&apos;t appreciate the rudeness from them or being made a fool of. The entire time I was talking to her, there was still loud laughter in the background. Not to mention the workers standing behind her laughing in my face while she was talking to me. She said she couldn&apos;t hear me. Funny how she couldn&apos;t hear me until I got mad. Yet, the entire time we went back and forth, they heard enough to laugh at. The only thing I find more repulsive to the very poor and skimpy quality of your food, is the unbelievable rudeness of your employees. Least of all, the lack of concern from your corporate office. This was in Pueblo, Colorado. I didn&apos;t report it because past experiences were less than productive. With so many businesses going under these days, I&apos;ll be the first to stand in line and laugh at you when yours goes under as well. It&apos;s just a matter of time. 



 peter oxford 10/23/11 
 I recently had taco bell. All I have to say is THEY WHERE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE BEEF.
WHEN I ORDERED AND SAW WHAT THEY DID , THEY USE THE EDGE OF THE GRILL PLATE TO CUT THE MEXICAN PIZZA. O GUESS THEY CANNOT AFFORD KNIVES. THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT A LAWSUIT AND HEALTH DEPT. 



 Eric Wolford 10/20/11 
 I was hired at a location only to wait 4 more weeks for the manager to tell me &quot;he had to wait to put my on the schedule.&quot; He never put me on the schedule nor did I ever work there. Taco Bell is a joke. The Taco Bell on Brown St in Dayton Ohio gave me and interview only to say you have to have a second interview. I went to the second interview was hired and told to go back to Brown street and tell the manager. Once I did this the manager did everything in his power to ignore me and not put me on the schedule. Not only did Taco Bell waste my time and money it seriously SCREWED ME!!!. Thanks Taco Bell for being a good corporation and an employer NOT!! Last I check people have bills to pay to live and how are they suppose to do that if a manager can&apos;t even be straight forward if they can work you or not. GET IT TOGETHER TACO BELL 



 Roger Silva 10/17/11 
 Wow im bummed I couldnt put 0 stars! What it deserves! On the night of Oct. 15, 2011, I purchased a XXL CHALUPA, not fully impressed but ate it anyways(biggest mistake of my life). How I ended up with food poisoning, I would love to know Taco Bell? I was hit with all the symptoms you can get, fever being the worst! I missed work thanks to you guys, its my bills that need to get paid!! 



 Angela 10/15/11 
 the reason taco bell is so shitty is bc they treat their employees like crap. they cant keep anyone for any amount of time and if they do then those ppl are pathic they over work their staff making most of them wrk 10 hr days and they are highly understaffed bc all they care about it there labor. also they clock their employees out before they are actually done closing bc they are so concerned about their labor. if taco bell wanted to improve anythng it would be to treat their employees as human beings rather thn jst some mindless drone who they dont care about as long as the customer keeps coming bak. i know jst for the fact that my boyfriend and everyone who works at taco bell gets treated this way i am never in my life going to spend a penny at another taco bell. 

 

 Josh 10/13/11 
 I just came from the taco bell o. 1264 Boston road in Springfield, MA. Im sitting down to eat and I see the manager in the back at the dive thru food station eating chicken wings with plastic gloves on, putting her hands in her mouth and then proceeds to make food for the drive thru without changing gloves. I&apos;m sorry but isn&apos;t there some kind of health code violation there? I&apos;ve worked for resturaunts ever since I started to work. I am repulsed by this. 



 Steve Matala 10/14/11 
 What the hell is wrong with the people at the top of this company, you have a great customer base, then all your employees do is PISS off the common public. The best part is that the corporate office does not seem to care; otherwise they would not do commericals that insult ones intelligence and they or I mean you would read the post on here. Its no wonder my granddaughter hates working for your company and she&apos;s mgt. Liftstation@aol.com if you care to discuss this, by the way FIRE your ad agency 



 Traci Pepper 10/11/11 
 I used the taco bell on the cornor of lomas and san mateo in albuquerque nm. I ordered a number 6 chulupa meal. when i got to work they had given me gorditas instead. i call to complain to the manager and she cant undertand what i am saying!!! doesnt speak enough english to resolve my issue. kept asking me to speak spanish....hello i am not spanish and DONT SPEAK SPANISH!!! I think it is crazy that your manager can not reslove an issue with a customer becouse your manager doesnt speak enough english to understand. New Mexico is still part of the United States last i checked and i was not REQUIRED to speak spanish to get help. 



 10/10/11 
 This is the worst store in Charlotte now Ive been eating at this store for years ive never had any complications on drive thru it looks like a whole new team that dosnt no what there doing i spent 5 dollars on my order for no reason Pineville Nc Carolina Pkwy. Please put someone one drive thru thats has more experience because this is Crazy 



 Steve Dugan 10/9/11 
 I live in southern California and had to endure a Taco Bell commercial with Brian Wilson, the relief pitcher from the San Francisco Giants. I&apos;m not sure if I saw the commercial on a local station or on a nationwide cable station. I would like to ask the corporate office not to show that commercial in southern California. We are Dodger fans. Some are Padre fans. Others are Angel fans Show the Human Brillo Pad on the San Francisco stations. If I see this commerical on a local, LA station, Del Taco gets my business. 



 Miss Richardson 10/7/11 
 This is for the location 1604 North Dixie Highway in Elizabethtown KY 42701 this was at 1:15 am on Friday night/Saturday morning 10/8/2011

Food was fine and they actually got my order completely correct, but I waited in the drive thru for about 20 min. Just to order for starters. Secondly, the cashier was a moron that moved/talked at the pace of a slug and i had to repeat myself twice...when I finally got to the window she stood there and talked to the people making my food the entire time instead of actually helping. Lastly I could hear the &quot;cooks&quot; laughing and talking about who was the favorite or something idiotic for the entire 15 minutes I had to wait on my food (the cashier even went above herself to say &quot;Come on guys its been 15 min.&quot;). It was the worste experience I have ever had at this particular location and I will not be going back. I know that young people need jobs too, but maybe u should consider hiring someone thats on unemployment instead of any numb skull that will work 3rd shift. Most absurd display of urgency and work ethic I have seen in a while. Hopefully its not the entire generation. 



 Rob A. 10/7/11 
 I have been a Taco Bell fan all my life. I moved to Central Valley a few months ago and found a Taco Bell that was close to my home and was thrilled...until...they proved what real poor service is about.

4 times in a row over the course of a month they screwed up the orders. My wife has a major cilantro allergy and I made it very very clear that she could not have any.
well guess what.... she opened up her food before she took a bite and found the &quot;pico toppings&quot; we said to keep off of her food. For myself they forgot several items I ordered and even my kids cin.twists and this was only the first time. the following three were drive thru orders and the same thing. missing food or mis made items.
last night 10/6/2011 I had to go back to the taco bell with my wife who is also in a wheelchair to bring back the food they messed up they remade the food and gave us the things they forgot with out an &quot;Im sorry&quot; Wow, this was the worst treatment ever. As the saying goes.. &quot;Run to the Border...Taco Bell... well next time I will run from Taco Bell and go to Jack in the Box, at least they care for their customers. Very unhappy and angry. Rob A 



 Shari 10/5/11 
 I really like taco bell, prices are decent. I am extremely frustrated with the people they hire. They can&apos;t even speak English at all. My food was shoved at my face by a lady that didn&apos;t speak to me at all because she was busy yelling in Spanish at her co workers. Please hire ENGLISH speaking Americans. 



 Liz 10/1/11 
 I went to toco bell and ordered a mexican pizza,with sour cream and a pepsi. Well they put the pizz upside down and forgot the sour cream. I called and complained and went back to get a free on and they forgot the sour cream, we remined them about the sour cream. Well I called again and talk with the manager and she replied well your still on the books we can try this a third time. What is so hard to put the sour cream on and they were not busy 



 kathryn 9/30/11 
 New taco bell in lexington sc in front of kmart is horrible with service and food prep. We waited in line for twenty minutes and the soft taco supremes were slapped to gether. Spoonful of meat half head of letthce and so messy you couldnt eat it like a raco you had to use a plate and fork. The sad tbing is this isnt the first time. Then when u call to speak with mgr the phones rings off the hook and no answer.ii 



 Dave, Elk Grove, California 9/28/11 
 On September 28th 2011, evening I decided to eat and stop to have a taco and put my expensive mountain bike inside the restaurant. As I purchased my taco and along my mountain bike inside, I decided quickly to eat that single taco and leave immediately, but after I was told of purchasing my taco and sat and took a single bite of the taco, the Taco Bell employee that mountain bike are not allowed inside the restaurant. This bad decision making on taco bell&apos;s part and should of been address beforehand that the taco was purchased. I told them that I would like a refund on the taco because I didn&apos;t have bicycle locks with me and this was a fast and i wasn&apos;t going to leave my expensive $1,200 dollar mountain bike outside. Still, the employee persisted to ask me to have the bike outside, and thats when another customer got involved and words were exchanged between me and 2 female customers and employee. This became nasty with the customer who wasn&apos;t part of the problem nor part of the solution that was handle by the Taco Bell&apos;s employee. As this became ugly, the female customers decided to get help from 8 males friends who started to have a physical confrontation with me and I was pushed. Taco Bell had called for police enforcement who arrived and broke up the fight scene. The police handled it when these teenagers were completely out of hand and provoke a fight by these 2 females who called their males. None of this would of happen if Taco Bell would of told me to in an advance upfront not to have the mountain bike inside and I would of taken my business elsewhere. I have 80% percent who knows my expensive gives me the courtesy of having my bike inside, due the fact management would hate to see an expensive bike stolen just if it was their bike. I wish Taco Bell as a courtesy could of handled it much better, in which they didn&apos;t. I didn&apos;t eat after the police arrested 1 suspect because of drunken in public. The police was looking out for my best interest due to the fact I had to be escorted to by my home, due to the fact I didn&apos;t want to be followed by teenage losers. Thats when a Taco Bell&apos;s employee walked with a taco in the bag for me when it was all over. This is what called bad customer service from a employee point of view and with bad judgement. I would like to be called on this with more explanation from the employee stand point and management. 



 Doug Smith 9/26/11 
 The Taco Bell in Arlington, Texas gave me a Taco with no meat after I ordered one with double meat, the Manager told me it was my problem that I should have looked ib the bag before I left. I ordered the Taco for my wife and I have never eaten a taco in my life- (I don&apos;t eat meat),so I didn&apos;t look at the taco, she also told me the price should have been a red flag-($1.40), I have purchased tacos for my wife 3 or 4 times in the last two years how can the price tell me if they left out the meat, the order screen had shown dou-meat they just messed up and sold me a taco with no meat for $1.40. The rude manager and the order taker needs to speak English and have common sense.

 Veronica Ortiz 9/23/11 
 Austin Texas... On Sept 18, 2011, my family and I went to eat lunch at Taco Bell after church. I ordered 2 chicken soft tacos, my family ordered the hard crunchy beef supreme tacos. the chicken tasted wierd but was packed with so much cheese I ate it anyways. I could not stand to eat the second. Immediately even before leaving Taco Bell I felt my stomach upset. I went home to lay down and about 11pm I was vomiting and had diarrhea. By Monday morning my stomach was in so much pain I went to the ER. To find out I got food poisoning. Now have been in and out of doctor offices to make sure because it was chicken that I dont have salmonella which then turns into meningitis. I have been out of work for the entire week. TOO SEVERE FOR ME TO EVER RETURN MY BUSINESS BACK AT ANY TACO BELL.

 LASHAWN DAVIS 8/12/11 
 I was just wondering how do you promote a worker to becoming a manager,when they dont even have an G.E.D I FEEL OTHER PEOPLE WHO PUT FORTH THE EFFORT TO GO BACK AND FINISH SHOULD BE REWARDED A HIGHER POSITION.HOW DO YOU SET AN EXAMPLE IF YOU ALLOW DUMMIES WHO ARE 40 TO OPERATE A BUSINESS?? AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY UR DRAWERS ARE SHORT @END OF SHIFTS. I KNOW THIS IS FAST FOOD BUT EVEN MCDONALDS MAKE YOU AT LEAST HAVE AN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION!!!!! ADVICE CHECK OUT ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO FIND YOUR WEAK LINKS!!!SHAWN L.JOSEPH OF AKRON OHIO ARLINGTON RD

 Taco bell Lake Murray blvd in Irmo SC managers have no class or respect. I called this store several times asking for corporate office number and they told me they don&apos;t have a corporate office. Then on top of that the manager Donald Cook has no class and respect. Where is customer satisfaction at taco bell. I will be filing a lot more complaints.

 Carol Decelles 9/16/11 
 TWO DAYS AGO I ORDERED AND PAID EXTRA MONEY FOR 2 BARRITO SUPREMES WITH THE 2 EXTRA SCOOPS OF BEEF, ( AND SPECIFICALLY ORDERED WITHOUT CHEEZE OF SOUR CREAM BECAUSE I AM ALLERGIC TO MILK PRODUCTS). I WAS IN THE DRIVE THROUGH AND GOT DOWN THE ROAD OUT OF TOWN EATING WHILE DRIVING AND GOT DEATHLY SICK BECAUSE I WAS EATING THE BARRITO FULL OF &quot;CHEESE&quot; OF WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO CANCEL MY TRIP/LOOSING MONEY OVER IT.
SO I INSPECTED THE SECOND BARRITO AND FOUND IT TOO WAS FULL OF CHEESE, SO I JUST PUT IT WRAPPED UP INTO MY FRIG. UNTIL I COULD DRIVE BACK TO THE STORE THE NEXT DAY.
SO THE NEXT DAY I AM REALLY STARVING SINCE I DID NOT EAT ANYTHING SINCE MY HEAVING SESSION, SO I JUST TOOK THE BIG HEAVY BURRITO BACK THROUGH THE DRIVE THROUGH AND ASK=ED POLITELY IF THEY COULD &quot;TRADE OUT THAT BURRITO FOR ONE OF THE SAME BUT MINUS THE &quot;CHEEZE PRODUCT&quot;. THE MEXICAN AT THE WINDOW APPARENTLY DOESN
T LIKE WHITE PEOPLE SO HE BEGAN TO SPEAK DOWN TO ME AS IF IT WAS SOME BING SCAM OF MINE FOR A FRESHER BURRITO, AND I WAS DRILLED 30 QUESTIONS IN AN INTERROGATION &quot;WHERE&apos;S YOUR RECIET. AT WHAT EXACT HOUR AND OF WHAT DAY DID YOU BUY THIS, WAS IT FROM THE DRIVE THROUGH OR INSIDE...WHY IS IT COLD THEN?!! HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THE EXTRAS? ....

HE MADE ME WAIT AT THE WINDOW FOR 12 MINUTES WITH HIM COMING BACK TO THE WINDOW ASKING 10 MORE STUPID QUESTIONS AS IF HE WAS STILL DECIDING IF THEY WOULD EVEN GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE! 4 MORE MINUTES GO BY AND HE COMES BACK TELLING ME TO FIND A PLACE TO PARK AND HE&apos;D BRING ME THE NEW PRODUCT OUTSIDE (AGAIN AFTER 3 MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO PUT ON IT REPEATED TO HIM 10 TIMES BY NOW!) THEN 4 MORE MINUTES GO BY AND I AM &quot;STARVING!!!!!GETTING WEAK AND SHAKY!&quot; HE FINALLY COMES OUT THERE TO HAND ME THIS SUPER SKINNY AND LIGHT WIEGHT BURRITO! AND I WAS IN COMPLETE CHOCK AND FINALLY FIGURED OUT THEY WERE INDEED &quot;F--ING WITH ME!&quot; EVEN THOUGH I WAS SO P[ATIENT AND NICE TO THEM. I STOPPED THE GUY AND SAID:&quot;HEY WAIT A MINUTE. THIS BURRITO IS ONLY HALF THE SIZE AS THE ONE I HANDED YOU!&quot; THE GUY JUST PLAYED DUM AND WALKED INSIDE,
SO WITH THAT I TOOK THE BURRITO INSIDE AND EXPLAINED I HANDED THEM A HEAVY BURRITO FULL TO THE MAX AND THEY JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BEEF AND VERY LITTLE TOMATOES AND LETTUCE AND ZERO OI=NIONS THAT I HAD REQUESTED. I ASKED FOR THEM TO HAND ME A PACKET OF THE EXTRAS AND I&apos;LL ADD IT TO IT MYSELF...AND I WAS JUST REFUSED THIS. SO AS I PRESSED THEY JUST STARTED LAUGHING AT ME BEING UPSET AND EXPLAINING TO THEM I HAVE INTESTINAL ISSUES AND WAS STARVING WEAK. THEN IN THE BACK I EVEN SAW THE TALL SKINNY MEXICAN LADY MANAGER LAUGHING WITH ALL YOUR MEXICANS THERE BEHIND THE COUNTER! I WAS SO HUMILIATED AND EXTREMELY WEAK FROM BEING SICK ALL NIGHT FROM THE DAY BEFORES INCORRECT BURRITOES THAT I COULD HAVE PASSED OUT RIGHT THERE! THEN I DEMANDED THE CORPORATE OFFICE PHONE NUMBER AND THEY ALL LAUGHED MORE REFUSING IT TO ME. FINALLY THE MAIN GUY HARASSING ME HANDS ME A SMALL GREEN AND WHITE PAPER WITH SOME &quot;CHANCE TO WIN TOLL NUMBER ON IT THAT THEY ALL KNEW WAS THE WRING NUMBER AND THEY ALL LAUGHED EVEN MORE!
I LEFT CRYING IN COMPLETE UPSET! AND HEAVED THAT TINY BURRITO AS WELL-BUT THIS TIME DUE TO COMPLETE UPSET! NOW I FIND OUT MORE OF THEIR BIG JOKE ON ME IS THAT THEY GAVE ME A WRONG CORPORATE OFFICE PHONE NUMBER DELIBERATELY!
WHY DON&apos;T YOU SPARE THE ANGLOS OF THIS TOWN ANY FURTHER ABUSE, AND GIVE A WHITE PERSON THE JOB?! I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND A CORPORATE APPO0LOGY.

 Store 003483 Big Rapids, Michigan 3:49 pm visit time
My wife and I ate at this store. The employees were very nice and cordial. The part we didnt like was sticky floors, employees in the cooking area had hats on but had buns through the back of hat and some had hair hanging out. I do believe should be wearing hair nets like other food establishments. Also employees whether theirs or just watching children should not leave them unattended while working. The music was very loud it over powered the tv which we were sitting one table away from could not here the tv.
One more thing when filling out a survey and not giving good reviews why are we not in the drawing this was not the first time i was not put in atleast part of the drawing, doesent seem like a good way to get repeat customers. Good and bad criticism is crucial to any business sorry if this bothers upper management

Thank you for listening to me

THIS FUCKING STORE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TACO BELL INCLUDING THE ONE ON BEACH BOULEVARD SUCK. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY POOR. THEY NEED TO FIX THEIR HEADPHONES BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAF AND MAKE US REPEAT THE SAME ORDER 20 TIMES. THESE MOTHERFUCKERS ESPECIALLY BLACK NIGGER EMPLOYEES, THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH AND TAKE THE ORDER. CHICKEN QUESEDILLAS MEANS CHICKEN BUT THE NIGGER GAVE ME STEAK. I TOLD THEM LIKE MORE THAN 10 TIMES. CHECK YOUR FUCKING CAMERAS YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES. IF YOU CANT TAKE CARE OF A CUSTOMER, CLOSE THIS SHIT. IF YOU GUYS CAN&apos;T DO ANYTHING IMMA MAKE FLYERS AND PUT IT EVERYWHERE TO MESS UP YOUR BUSINESS.

 I have lived in 3 different states and would like to know why every state does not have the same menu? I grow up in Southern Illinois and my favorite burrito is a chili cheese burrito and I asked for it in Southern California and they did not have it and now I live in the middle of Virginia and they do not have it as well... I do not appreciate not being able to have the same food from the same restaurant in a different location... It&apos;s not like I want to move for personal reasons I have to move because I am married to a Marine... PLEASE GET THE SAME FOOD ON THE MENU&apos;S FOR EVERY STORE... I can understand if it is a Taco bell in a gas station but I only go to Taco bells that are just only taco bell...
THANKS

 I have always loved taco bell, but I ate at the Morgan hill, ca location at 6:30pm last night and got food poisoning. I have been so sick. Every hour on the hour from 9 pm last night to 2 pm today is the last time. I have never been so sick. My boss is pissed and I have to miss a Bday party tonight. This sucks. Never again, tb!

 There was hair in my food. Wtf?! Gross. There are three where I live. One isn&apos;t clean, one put meat on my meatless food that I ordered during lent, and one just always screws up everything. That&apos;s not classy. 



 Mike 8/29/11 
 Well I know taco bell is fast food and I should expect great service or great food! But the one thing I hate is ordering food on lunch and getting back so I&apos;m not late and bam!! It&apos;s the wrong food! Is it really hard to understand when I saw I want a #6 Baja style? And these young dumb teens that giggle and laugh and give me a #6 but supreme style! Talk about disgusting! Threw it away! I hate plain sour cream!! 



 D D 9/1/11 
 I went to taco bell in Plymouth,MA the other day after being stuck in traffic.I was starving ,so I spent the extra $$ to get two steak gorditas.

When I sat down to eat them in the restaurant,my first three bites were all SOUR CREAM and LETTUCE!! I looked inside and found FOUR dime sized pieces of steak !!!

I went to the manager to ask if he&apos;d pay for this and all he said was &quot; I can see that they didn&apos;t spread the meat around &quot; .

I later told my girlfriend about this.She said she has a friend that use to work there who told her that &quot; employees can&apos;t eat the food there,so they short YOU on the portions of meat ,to allow them to eat for free &quot; .

This IS FRAUD,I have video documented both gorditas and am about to post the footage on YOUTUBE .I am also contacting the AG&apos;s office,Martha Coakley to file a formal consumer fraud complaint.This is due diligence and you have been formally notified.

TACO BELL,your employees are stealing from customers the already very small amount of meat you portion leaving next to nothing in your product. 



 Reginald Jones 9/2/11 
 I am complaning about the KFC/Taco Bell/Pizza Hut on 1005 Bichara BLVD in Lady Lake Florida. (352-359-0901) I went to taco bell and ordered 10 soft shell surpreme taco&apos;s, they made a mistake and gave me hard shells instead. When I return so they can fix my order they shorted me 1 taco that I paid for. The cashier name is Michelle and the order started at 20:38 on Sep. 02, 2011. This is not the only time they mess up orders, I find them too incompitant.

 Went to the Taco Bell on NW Highway and
McArthur in Oklahoma on Friday night 9/2/2011 at 10:45 PM and stood in the lobby for 10 minutes. There were at least 5 customers in line ahead of us and no one to take anyone&apos;s order. Employees continued to walk around and eventually locked the doors to the lobby. Never got even acknowledged and the customers ahead of us said they had been there for over 30 minutes in line and no one ever acknowledged them either. In tough economic times this has to be a concern for Taco Bell Corporate office. This is a sad day in America and I&apos;m thinking I took it inside the bun.

 poor customer service with no desire to fix any issues went home with half my order told me they would replace next time i came back went back gave me a line of bullshit did not fix the problem i will never return 



 Store #017192 Lincoln heights, Ohio 9/14/11 
 This taco bell is the worst restraunt it never has meat and always runs out of something the management is very poor and the customer service sucks to say the least I spend about 100.00 a week there and only a few times I had all my food made rite. I like tacos alot and never really had any problems with taco bell till I moved near this one and it&apos;s only a few min from my house. Hope the corporate office reads this and does something about the poor quality of the food preparation and the poor service!

 A few minutes ago my wife called to say the she was at Taco Bell in Kenwood, Ohio and the ahead of her in line refused his food because the employee preparing his food had just &quot;picked his butt.&quot; Naturally, my wife left the restaurant immediately. Is there anything that isn&apos;t disgusting about Taco Bell? I wonder what the Health Department would think. 



 9/4/11 
 For 2 nights in a row multiple taco bells in the North Syracuse NY, and Cicero areas have been out of chicken and keeping car backed up for very long periods of time which is totally unacceptable!!!! Why the shortage of chicken?Why is Taco Bell constantly running out of thing on the menu to offer people? You seriously need to take a look at these issues or you will lose huge amounts of customers because I will make this statement go viral on FB and the internet..A very dissatisfied customer.

 I was just at the taco bell 7410 w newberry in Gainesville Florida. I must tell you it was the worst service I have ever experienced! when I got &quot;in line&quot; I was the only one in line and the two people at the register didn&apos;t say anything. So, when I was finally able to order I ordered 1 cheese roll up, 1 99 cent nachos, 1 small drink, and a milk. They didn&apos;t give me a receipt so when the order came up I tried to ask the girl if it was a cheese roll up and her response was go ahead and take it. I looked in the bag and there was some sort of food all over the wrapper of the cheese roll up, the nachos were not correct either. When I told them no one responded to me. And when I called the Shift Manager to notify her she made a face and did some kind of hand signal. Then the same girl that brought the food over if the first place started to say something about me or my order and the wonderful Shift Manager agreed and talked over her. I know it is fast food, but I do expect it to be correct. And for everyone to keep their attitudes to themselves, I was not rude to anyone and expected them to not be rude either. But of course that was not the case. Sorry this was so long, but they were very rude and aggravating.

 This is the experience I had at Taco Bell on 13th Street in Gainesville, Florida on September 2, 2011.

As I approached the restaurant I saw two employees and a shift manager, I believe the only one wearing a headset, were sitting outside, it appeared there was no one inside the restaurant. When I arrived at the speaker, the shift manager informed me &quot;Our computers are down right now.&quot; I replied, &quot;What?&quot; She stated the computers would be down for twenty minutes. I said, &quot;My daughter worked here and I know that is bogus.&quot; She asked if I was Alex&apos;s mom and I affirmed I am. She then said, &quot;Oh, I will get up and make food for you.&quot; To which I declined. Since Florida Bell took over approximately one and a half years ago, this restaurant has continually gone down hill. They have hired one unprofessional and incompetent general manager after another. The last one was known for using drugs with the employees and pretty much had an anything goes attitude. His replacement has long hair which always appears dirty and has a noticeable body odor.
In the past, I patronized Taco Bell an average of at least four times per week; I currently frequent Taco Bell an average of once every three weeks. This is due to instances of the restaurant closing early, receiving below par service when I do go, items constantly being unavailable, employees and managers hovering by the doors smoking so that I have to walk through a cloud of smoke in order to enter or exit the restaurant and an overall substandard experience.
It is rumored that the regional coach is fully knowledgeable of what has been taking place and has taken no action to correct the situation.
This restaurant is giving Taco Bell an unfavorable image, which is so unfortunate, especially in these economic times when consumers are becoming more and more selective as to where they will spend their money.

IMPORTANT: I ADVISE YOU TO NEVER GO TO THIS TACO BELL - YOU, YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY COULD END UP HURT, SERIOUSLY !!


I went to this Taco Bell on our way home from seeing frieworks on July 4th - It&apos;s almost 1am at this point, so technically it&apos;s now July 5th. - We start to order and the lady starts huffing and puffing on the speaker because we had asked for no red chips. We find it to be unprofessional and rude, but we ignore it and continue with our order. Then, she says &quot;im not taking your order, i dont have to..&quot; and cuts us off completely, turning off her mic/speaker because we took to long to order!! so we pull up, nobody comes to the window, but two guys come out the front door of Taco Bell (in Taco Bell uniforms) and over to our car. One swings on my cousin, trying to hit him. Then a girl dressed in regular clothes come out, she starts yelling at us too. Meanwhile, I also have a sleeping baby in the car. The last person to come out was a girl in Taco Bell uniform who told them something I could not hear and they all went inside and then closed Taco Bell at 1am (2 hours early) I have never seen anything like this before! We were just on our way home after a long day and were hungry. If this is Taco Bell&apos;s employees, they should rethink who they have working for them. Maybe they could care less? I give this fast food restraunt a big thumbs down!!! Taco Bell is my favorite, but after what happened last night, I will NEVER go back again!!!! 

 

 Teresa 7/5/11 
 My husband and I just finished with a soccer game this evening, and were thinking of a place for everyone to eat. We had our choice of anywhere to go, but taco bell has always been good to us. When we get there my husband walks in and he sees the associate walking to the registers and she yells the &quot;F&quot; word. The manager,Amber, heard her and tells her to be quiet. The cashier says to the manager &quot;I don&apos;t care&quot;! Needless to say we left. Taco Bell could have easily made $100 or more.---- I seriously hope this matter is addressed. Wewill not be back if this is the kind of employees you hire to run your stores.
Taco Bell N.Bryant, San Angelo,TX.---Thank you.

 Clearwater Resident 7/8/11 
 I wanted to let TACO BELL&apos;s corporate office know that their new commercial, which portrays all thin foreign customers commenting on how big the XXL Grilled Stuffed Burrito, is insulting to Americans!! This commercial shows that Taco Bell knows Americans are so obese that they will eat this GIANt BURRITO, whereas the foreigners are thinking of sharing it with others because it&apos;s so big!! THANK YOU TACO HELL...I MEAN BELL for making Americans look like pigs by advertising this product in our country and using foreigners to act in your commercial!! I am so glad I do not eat this junk food, and especially TACO BELL!!

I pulled to the drive thru at the same taco bell that I usually go to. First this location ran out of Mt. Dew......how does that happen? No excuse.
The employee taking my order repeated it correct back to me, then when I pulled up to the window I asked her how much it was and when I looked up she was starring at me and smiling like a crazy person. She was stoned or high or for sure on some sort of drug. She had a huge ugly tattoo on her left arm, then she kept saying &quot;huh&quot; and giggling. Then she over charged me and shorted me on my order. Needless to say this employee really paints a bad picture of your company. I wont be back to that location even if you paid me. 



 Tresa Frick 8/6/11 
 I went to taco bell yesterday by my house. Ordered $45.00 worth of food. The guy in the window dropped a drink in my lap. (large pop) Then proceeded to tell me &quot;if i had clocked out 3 minuets ago like I was supposed to this would never have happened&quot;. Then he proceeded to attempt to give me my order. I informed him I would be parking my car to clean up a little bit. He needed to carry it out to me. I parked my car attepmted to clean up. All the while waiting for managment to come assist or appologize. No one came for 10 mins. I went in asked an employee for some napkins and towels to clean up. She says to me &quot;does the manager know?&quot;. Probably not if she isn&apos;t already out here. I go back to my car 5 mins goes by and a manager and 2 female employees come out. The manager then says It figures Derrick would do this. He never apologized never informed managment he had done this. I called after I got home to inform them that they would need to pay for the cleaning of my car on the left side interior. The manager in a tone of &quot;not my problem&quot; that I would have to call the GM Jolene on Tuesday to handle this. If I had a pos car that was ragged out and nasty I would not have cared, but my car is washed and waxed weekly by me. The interior is like new. I clean my car interior and exterior weekly. I got in my car this morning and could not touch a thing. The seats were sticky and they are cloth! The dash, door panel, door jamb, driver seat floor window and center console were all sticky and I had attempted to clean it up last night. I am furious with this store due to their lack of care and lack of responsibility for what they had done. If it was water I wouldn&apos;t care as much except for the mold smell that would come. It was a large pop that was spilled into my car. Now it is sticky. Not to mention I had to shower before I could eat. So my food was cold when I went to eat. Which added on to my anger. They need to make this right. I am not asking for a full steam clean just clean the areas that were effected by the spillage! Store number 026467 really needs a retraining on how to deal with situations such as this! 



 D. Williams 8/6/11 
 I went taco(fayettville,ar) on college ave(71b) on Aug.6 2am was attack by a store manger verbal.He told I need to talk clear in a nice voice it mad me feel ashame.call me drunk in front my friend I think people should b allowed to work who is rude to consumer like that. 



 Dorothy 7/16/11 
 I would rate Taco Bell a -10 stars if possible. I am furious about the shoddy management at our store in Raytown, MO. The food was made incorrectly two visits in a row, and I had to go back to have it remade. I also asked for a refund the first time and received it. Today, I once again asked for a remake and a refund, and was told be a very rude manager that I could have one or the other. When I asked why, she responded &quot;You pulled this twice in a row, and I won&apos;t do it again.&quot; The inplication was that I had done something wrong. She also refused to give me the name of the district manager. Needless to say, I won&apos;t be eating Taco Bell food anywhere again. I will continue to search for the district manager, and I would rather starve than eat Taco Bell. And from reading the remarks on this page, I&apos;m not the only one. 



 Ray Swanson 7/18/11 
 
I have repeatedly been missing parts of my orders at the Taco Bell restaurant located at 510 N Mayfair Rd Milwaukee Wi. This isn&apos;t just a one time occurence, it has happened several times. Please notify the Mgr, and more importantly send someone from Corporate to abserve what is going on there. Someone needs to impress on the employees that each order should be double checked before giving it to the customer. Based on what I have seen they are not checking. Thank you for your prompt attention. Please do not use my name in any investigation. 



 this is hilarious 7/19/11 
 i dont remember how i got here, i was trying to make an ACTUAL complaint, you guys realize this website is not by taco bell, and no one at taco bell corporate is seeing a single thing you morons are writing, some of you sound so stupid its unreal lol, kudos to the guy who complained about the 89 and 99 cent difference, you are a real prize, dude i dont think people care, either that or no one is as poor as you. 



 Keith 7/19/11 
 At least once a week I go to the tacobell at 347 and southern in nesconset new York and everytime they forget to give me multiple parts of my order. When I try to get what they forgot they make me wait for anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour tonight. Last week they refused to correct the issue. U have taken my money and now my time. My time is money in my pocket if you continueto rob me I will be left to demand reparations for my losses improve this store! 



 Erik 7/19/11 
 Last three visits at taco bell have been a bad experience. Product quality is poor with very light portions of beef. Will not return to another taco bell. 



 Kevin 7/21/11 
 @Robert.. I have had multiple similar experiences too. And today, finally after submitting numerous complaints via the form on the website someone from the local store gave me a call. He barely spoke english and indicated that the store is a franchise store and they have the right to charge what they want and to not follow the advertised deals that we see on TV, the website or otherwise. And basically explained to me that they operate just like gas stations do. One may charge .99 for a burrito while the one across the street might charge $3.05 like mine did for this recent .99 burrito supreme promo.... After all of this BS with Taco Bell.. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go there again and I will go someplace else.. perhaps Taco Time as I actually like their food better anyway. .. It&apos;s a shame that some companies have to engage in misleading and false advertising and rip people off this way... I have been under contract to push walmart.com, thrifty.com, dollar.com and many other websites to the top of the search engines for over 12 years and if you don&apos;t think i can push this issue to the top of Google for everyone to see?? You are nuts and will be sorry when it happens for the publicity this garbage will receive. ~~ Cheers and GOODBYE Taco Hell. 



 tess gaul 8/4/11 
 burritos--.99 limit 2 per person..Just me here and I wanted 3 with chicken.If I wanted 2, (each would cost.90 extra per burrito for chicken). Why couldn&apos;t it be rang as 2 different orders? I could have saved a few dollars in stead of paying $9.27 for 3 of them!! What a rip and it wasn&apos;t that great..
.99+.90=$1.89 x 3= $5.67 vs $3.09x3=$9.27.............what a rip-off this taco bell is...letting you and America know! 



 MR. Barris Gibson 8/4/11

 Emily 8/5/11 
 My boyfriend and I went to the Taco Bell on woodruff about 11:15 on Thursday night. The drive through was pretty busy. The girl infront of us went straight through the order line and to the window, her friend was working. She did NOT order food, but they continued talking about &quot;who they saw one night and what the were doing this weekend.&quot; About 4 minutes passed of them just talking and cars started to get irritated. My boyfriend honked the horn and told them he was waiting for his food. They Both, even the employee at the window, started to laugh at him. The employee then handed her friend at least 25 of the sauce packets, and she began to throw them and hit our car, as they both laughed. We called and tried to speak to the manager, but the girl at the drive through answered, saying she was the manager and called my boyfriend a &quot;white boy cracker&quot; and said she had not thrown the packets, her friend did. She refused to let us speak to a manager or tell us when he was working.
What kind of a business are you running when your employees verbally and physically assault your customers with racist remarks and throwing food items? I have never been treated so poorly anywhere. I will be telling all of my friends about how we were treated at your restaurant. And I&apos;m also thinking about contacting my lawyer about my legal options. 



 david hill tell city indiana 8/5/11 
 went to taco bell today and placed my order . i was very disapointed as always . thwe twists i ordered were so stale we could not eat them. the last five times for sure when i went to taco bell my orders were screwed up in one way or another . what is going on ... 



 frypan 8/3/11 
 Went to Taco Bell in Southgate, Michigan to try out he Triple Steak Burrito. For $3.99 I got rice and beans. There was absolutely no meat at all, much less triple steak! Won&apos;t be going to Taco Bell again. There&apos;s a much better quality take out Mexican restaurant that I pass in order to get to Taco Bell - and they deliver!! Taco Bell&apos;s quality of food and advertising are deplorable. 



 Linda Rea 8/3/11 
 My husband and I took our 6-year old granddaughter to Taco Bell, Sunset Blvd., Lexington SC on 8-2-11 between 8 and 9 p.m. There were only a few customers and some of the staff were very loudly talking about who had done the most work -- &quot;I swept and cleaned the lobby&quot;, &quot;I washed dishes,&quot; etc. I hate to be in any store and hear the workers complaining. To top it off, a young girl standing at the cash register, yelled to someone in the kitchen &quot;hell no.&quot; This was very loud and easy for anyone to hear. I did not appreciate that language, especially with my 6-year old granddaughter hearing it. BTW, she loves Taco Bell and it was only because of her that we were eating there. The folks I saw in the kitchen were young people -- did not see anyone who appeared to be a manager.
 



 Joseph York 8/3/11 
 I know that Taco Bell is not the only franchise to have team meetings in the dining area, but why does it have to look like a board meeting or a self help seminar, I wanted to tell the manager running the meeting to stop bloviating and practicing psychcology and &quot;shut up&quot; so we could eat in peace. His ego was overpowering any hot sauce I could get hold of. By the way, the dollar &quot;Burrito Supremes&quot; were really small and therefore didn&apos;t seem like such a bargain. As a customer, I felt we were not as important as the one man show and his captive audience. Thank you for listening. I might come back when the customer matters.

 The taco bell in indianapolis Indiana on west tenth st and the corner if girls school there is a girl working there and she has staff infection and from what I heard that is very illegal and shouldnt be galling because of health and safety reasons 

 

 Amy 7/28/11 
 Montgomery, AL Carmichael Rd. Store. Last week went through drive-thru while it was pouring rain&amp;there is a HUGE pothole in the drive-thru. Impossible to see while raining so my car fell into it leaving major damage. Pulled up to the speaker, no response. Pulled up to the window, the lady just looked at me like I&apos;m an idiot. (The store was not closed it was 10 pm!) So not only did I destroy my car, the employees would not help me, nor would they serve me food. Called corporate&amp;local manager never called me back like they were supposed to. Called corporate again, lets see if they call me this time&amp;ALSO what they plan to do about the damage to my car! There&apos;s no telling how many other cars have been damaged in the same location. Also they need some helpful employees. 



 johnie umderwood 7/28/11 
 I have been eating at taxi bell for many years. I Would have to say that in the last year your food quality has diminished greatly. My most recent visit, today, my food was cold soggy and did not taste fresh.
I don&apos;t know what has happened but it needs to be corrected. 



 Lisa Skovira 7/29/11 
 I have visit the Taco Bell at Annapolis Rd ,Maryland and I must say the person at the drive thru was very disrespectful.I beleive her name was Chelsea, I dont think she takes her job serious enough or is being an asset to the company.Customer Serice was horrible and as a military member serving the country so she can enjoy her freedom and being disrespectful to me.She needs to be handled and not to mention my order was incorrect 



 Joel Dies 7/30/11 
 705 York Road, Kings Mountain, NC 28086-3662

My wife and myself went last night after she got off of work and we placed our order. It took around fourty minutes to get from where you put in your order in the drive-thru to the window and by that time their computers went down and lost all the orders. We waited for forty minutes for nothing. They could have sent out an employee with a pen and paper to get the orders so by the time the car got to the window they would not have to wait on their order again that they were already waiting on for the past half hour to hour. Very poor management skills as that could have been handled various ways. They did not even let the cars know, that were piling up, that there was an issue. This was after the lobby was closed otherwise I would have went in and and asked for the manager just to tell him how much of a flub up he was being. 



 a very angry customer 7/30/11 
 Hello I will start off by saying Taco Bell in Dayton Tn is very un-professionally ran by the manager of the name Michelle. Me and my family walked in to the Taco Bell Lobby where we place our order to-go because every time we go through drive through they screw it up. I am very dis-pleased with the way Michelle, the manager responds when I and my family walk into the doors, her words are, Here&apos;s Trouble or Oh God get ready for their order... I dont think that is her job to criticize or make fun of me and my family it is her job to take our order then the money and say thank you for choosing taco bell have a nice day. Well, every time we leave there we have half our order or our order is messed up, the food is stale and tastes old, or they put it together and it looks like pig slop. I also put in a job there along side of my fianc and she tells me you cant work here not even on separate shifts, if your out then he will be out of work but just yesterday, my cousins fianc who lives directly behind us gets a job there and she is allowed to work there and the managers words to my fianc about me getting a job was if there is a death in the family I will have two workers out and not just one. Well I told my fianc to go to Michelle and ask her why she is able to work there and her being just as much family as my fianc she says its different and I feel it is no different if there is a death in the family she and my fianc will both be out. Does that make it fair for her to work and not me? I do need a job and it is hard for me to find a job because I have never had one and the only business in Dayton hiring at that time was taco bell and we both need income not just one. I myself am over-weight and I think she does not want me working there because of that fact she has only one person over weight that works there and that is only because they go &quot;way back&quot; they both worked across the street at Pizza hut were the over weight lady was Michelles boss and now Michelle is her boss. I almost feel I am being discriminated against due to my weight. Point is she is constantly making slurs about me and my family being trouble when we order, a five person family is a lot to order for, but I never knew that they could be so un-professional and get away with it. On another note, my fianc who works at this specific taco bell works a late night shift and got sent home in June all because he didnt make his time of 60 seconds to get an order taking and the order out he got 90 seconds and at this time she is standing not ever 3 inches behind him looking over his shoulder which makes anyone nervous I know it does me. Well he then tells her nicely that he cant work with her over his shoulder making him nervous and there was a witness there who says the same thing about him being nice she writes him up and sends him home which cuts his hours and his pay. Michelle and other floor managers there ask my fianc and others to work on his/her break and makes them work off clock at times and once again he does NOT get paid for this I know he is of age and what not but point is he earns his break and does not get all his breaks required and she tells the employees they cant be at the store past 4 am which they dont get done cleaning and working and so on till nearly 5am. There was a girl who got hired 3 days ago and was scheduled to work from 9pm-4am and did not come in Michelle the manager was notified about this and did not come in she left my fianc and the shift manager work it by themselves and had another floor manager go to this girls house and get her shirt, hat, and name tag she got fired. Also, because my fianc works there I do no what comes on the &quot;new&quot; items on the menu for example the new triple steak burrito is supposed to have 3 scoops of steak which is what your paying for, she does not put three scoops she puts 1 1/2 or 2 sometimes if your lucky 2 1/2 which if your living from pay check to pay check you would understand if you are paying for something you want what you paid for. I do not understand how this so called manager can get away with this non-sense. She once was in a meeting with all the other managers and told the others that if it is her job in jeopardy she will throw the other managers under the bus (pretty much meaning make them lose there job) just to keep her job. If you are a manager then you have a big responsibility with orders, employees, customers, workers who do not show up etc... I do hope that there are further actions taking on this complaint or I will contact a higher authority! My fianc loves his job and wants a career out of this but cant as long as people are un-professional about this! This is not the first nor the last time there will be a complaint from me or my family my family is a very large numbered family and the taco bell in Dayton makes hundreds of dollars from my family monthly and if something is not done I will make sure my family stops going to this taco bell! My sympathy goes out to the other customers who have the same problems I do and hopefully if we can get this taken care of then the taco bell restaurants will be more of a friendly and easy going relaxing place to eat your dinner with your family. Again, I am so sorry to say that I avoid making trips to Taco Bell in Dayton, TN when Michelle is working. I dont like her attitude and anyone working in this sort of field should have a more positive attitude and personality and for sure should look cleaner than she does. I would rather someone that looks like they have bathed to make my order as to have someone that has such bad hygiene preparing my food. My opinion may not mean much but seeing as how I am a paying customer, I hope that you take care of this problem and see that your rules on your end are strictly enforced. We all have rules and in a business such as this there are no excuses for breaking the rules. 



 Barbara Land 6/21/11 
 We stopped at the Taco Bell in Mount Shasta and the &quot;meat product&quot; was inedible. The ONLY thing that tasted right were the chips around the taco pizza, but they were mostly bad because they had so much contact with the other bad stuff. It tasted bad&amp;smelled bad, Before that trip my husband&amp;I had some burritos at our local Taco Bell in Ukiah, CA and they were pathetic, mostly beans. Taco Bell is going way downhill from what it used to be. How can these places stay in business????

 I have been a loyal customer of taco bell for over ten years today after a long hard day I went to taco bell in parump Nevada to get three crunch wrap supremes because of the advertised price of 99 cents. I was subsequently told the sale ended on Sunday the 19th when in fact that was when it started this was on Wednesday the 22nd I was disappointed but that soon turned to anger when I returned home and watched three commercials within the hour saying the sale was on all week . This is not only bad business it&apos;s FALSE ADVERTISING you can be sure I&apos;m going to report this to the better business bureau thanx for your bad treatment my family will support del taco from now on

 Please, Please, Please bring back your Taco Light&apos;s!!!!!!! At least to the one in Enid Oklahoma. I&apos;ve rarely gone to taco bell since you stopped selling them many years ago. 



 RuthEllen Christensen 6/12/11 
 On 6/11/2011, my husband and I drove 1/2hr to the Norfolk Ne Taco Bell just to have a meal there since it had been 7yrs after leaving Az and not having been to taco bell since. We went there twice that day. The first time was good but when i went back to order the 12 tacos in a BOX, not only did I get them in a BAG, but when i opened them up, it looked like someone could have taken a TSP full of meat and ran it along the taco,threw a tiny bit of lettuce and called it good. Not only were they sawgy or soft, but they didnt re-heat at all. That was a total WASTE of my 10.00 and I am steaming hot over this. I will be calling corporate later and complaining to the max! We will be trying Taco Johns to see if they are any better.
Still hot over this and i&apos;m hoping corporate can rectify this issue.

 Just went to TB here in my hometown (Edinburgh,IN). Now I see why everyone says to avoid them. Only 4 people there 2 works and 2 non workers, one of the workers the manager Shawna was on the phone. Placed my order, took them 10 minutes to figure out they was out of the nacho cheese sauce and another 5 to get my one yes I said 1 freaking hard taco. I run a resturant and I would have done fired everyone there. Didn&apos;t want to replace my nachos and cheese or anything, I will NEVER go back. I love mexican food, but I will spend my money from now on at Hardees/Red Burrito. Its more expensive but at least I get my food in a timely matter and good customer service. 15 min for a hard shell taco is ridiculous! 



 Privated 6/13/11 
 tacobell is the worst of the worst customer service zero and people pay for food that is not even fresh and or little meat and other ingredients. and they still out there making millions and billions. Corporate dont really care much about all this people writing here.. 



 robert 6/14/11 
 i contacted taco bell for bad service and they said i would receive coupone in 5-7 day and still have not bad taco bell 



 I want to wait !!! 6/15/11 
 shift lead demands I move in order for her to make her service time
look better. I&apos;ve left two messages at corporate level and do you think
they would want to know how their employees are fraudulently altering
the drive through service clocks.
Worst service ... from a store ... as for corporate well I believe they are
just trying to come up with a new slogan ... &quot;wait wait wait @ taco bell&quot;

 Please be aware that your Taco Bell franchise in Los Lunas, New Mexico


Taco Bell
2501 Main St SE
Los Lunas, NM 87031
(505) 866-0161

Has been selling tacos under a fraudulent price listing. For example, I went into this Taco Bell
on June 14 and again on June 16 to purchase a Double Decker Beef Taco for a listed price
of $1.59 and was charged $1.79 + tax for a total of $1.93.

I tried to call attention to the discrepancy on their price listing
and the female clerk on the above dates simply walked away to
the back and ignored my order.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

 



 pam thacker 6/17/11 
 After reading all the horror stories before mine im wondering if this is a waste of my time. First I want to know how Taco Bell runs out of the only two meats it has to sell? This is the third time it has happened to me and the last time. I will not return to the taco bell in Monticello In ever again. When your company is based on beef and I know somebody can tell when its low and to just let It run out is just plain lazy and stupid. What kind d of people do you hirer? The low of the low? What kind of managers do you have? Maybe you should clean out your store and start all over!!!

 austin fromm 6/19/11 
 we just left the taco bell in new haven, indiana.
we sat at the drive thru for seven minutes and no one took our order, we could see the employess standing around in there. i don&apos;t know if you can do anything about this, but that&apos;s terrible. if i ran things, they would all be fired. and this is coming from a KFC employee, i know how easy their job is. 

 

 6/6/11 
 I am sure that the national media would love to hear my story. Taco Bell didn&apos;t like being accused of FAKE MEAT. Now Taco Bell is accusing a customer of FAKE MONEY.



Now an update on my money.

I got a letter today from the Tucson Police department saying to pick up my $10.00 dollars, it turns out it was real money all along. I called Taco Bell, and the area manager Veronica was a JERK. They refuse to give me any freebies for the time I spent, waiting for the Police that day, and now I have to go clear across town to retrieve my money. Think about my gas, time spent, and wear on my car.

So do yourself a favor instead of running for the border, run away from Taco Bell.




My story is below this story...

Be careful about spending those old $10 bills
By William Polley on March 9, 2005 1:04 PM
From the Peoria Journal Star:

PEORIA - When Scott Stanard ordered his usual sausage, egg and cheese biscuit combo Monday morning, he got two policemen on the side.
Stanard said the staff at McDonald&apos;s, 3600 N. University St., called police after he handed over a $10 bill that they said was a fake.
&quot;I kept wondering why they weren&apos;t giving me any change,&quot; said Stanard, who sat in the drive-thru lane in his work van for several minutes before deciding to pull up and park.
&quot;I knew I didn&apos;t do anything wrong - I got it from Family Video,&quot; he said, more upset from the embarrasssment, and the fact that he didn&apos;t get his food.
Two officers arrived, talked to him and went in the restaurant to get the alleged funny money.
&quot;(The police) said it was old - a 1950&apos;s series $10 bill - and the markers they use don&apos;t work on old money,&quot; Stanard said.
And the conclusion of the article:

In many instances, police will send suspected counterfeit money to the Secret Service for close scrutiny.
In Stanard&apos;s case, [Secret Service agent] Pingolt suspected the officers were able to tell the $10 bill was old and wouldn&apos;t stand up to the marker test. Hence, Stanard was not arrested, Pingolt said.
Stanard said police took the $10 bill, telling him he could pick it up later if it was real. If the bill turned out to be fake, it would be destroyed.
Despite still being peeved at the McDonald&apos;s management, Stanard was pleased Tuesday. He got his money back.
If the bill was in good condition and from the 1950&apos;s it might have had some collectable value. Of course now it probably has a big marker stain on it from those counterfeit detecting markers, making it worth...$10.

At least the police exercised some common sense and didn&apos;t haul the guy off in handcuffs as sometimes happens.


My story...

I had the same thing happen to me this week in Tucson Az., at the Taco Bell on Golf Links/Harrison. On Wed. May 4th, I was in the drive thru, and I handed them a Ten Dollar bill which was dated 1969, and back then our US money did not have the security strips, or the watermarks on them. The casher held it up to the light to look for these features, she didn&apos;t see them, so she went back to the manager with the bill. He came back up to the drive thru counter, and told me that the bill was no good, and was funny money. I tried to tell them about how money used to be. So they said they had to keep it and call the Police. I called 911 myself, and told the Police to come ASAP. They came, looked at my money, and said it looked real to them, but they had to take it, seeing Taco Bell complained. So now it is in the hands of the city of Tucson, waiting for the Secret Service approval of it being real money.

 I have to say, I am fed up with Taco Bell! The service stinks and the food is getting worse every time I go there! I usually go to the one on Wiles Road and 441 in Coral Springs, FL. I just tortured myself tonight again and went back. For 9 years we have lived here and usually stop there to get takeout. Well, tonight I&apos;m done! I waited for 7 minutes in line at the drive thru just to order! I was the ONLY car there! Then went to window, paid right away, and waited another 9 minutes for my food! I know this doesn&apos;t seem like a lot of time, but its supposed to be FAST FOOD! Not only that, once again my order was wrong!!!! I have had maybe 3-4 instances when my order was correct! Are you kidding me?! 16 minutes of fuel, $12 for food, and the wrong order! No thanks! There are too many other places to eat that appreciate my hard earned $!!!! And treat me respectfully! I have NEVER complained to a business before but enough is enough! I am a waitress and I wouldn&apos;t make the money I make if I ever treated people like that! Adios Taco Bell! 



 Gary 6/9/11 
 You need to change policy on charging for ice water. Cheap! You have lost us to Taco Buenos the don&apos;t charge 



 Kate White 5/23/11 
 Concerns store in St Clair MO. I went in 5/21/11 at 8:50 pm. Stood behind one woman while the counter kid joked around with two other young guys--neither employees nor customers. When he finally turned his attention to her, she asked a question about her existing order. The two buddies were rude to her and the employee did nothing to stop them. She walked away leaving me as the ONLY customer in line. The counter guy turned away. I continued to stand there. After a few minutes another employee asked if I&apos;d been helped. I said no. Unbelievably, he walked away!!! The counter guy never came back to take my order. After a couple more minutes I left and took my business to the nearby McDonald&apos;s. I know fast food jobs aren&apos;t the greatest but please can&apos;t they hire at least one adult per shift? Leaving three teenage boys to run a business doesn&apos;t exactly result in great customer service. If you allowed me to grade this place a zero-star place I would. Very disappointing since most Taco Bells are not at all like this. BTW, they lost a big order. I was trying to get food for my very hungry extended family. 



 Arleta Meyer 5/31/11 
 Just came from the Taco Bell/Long John Silvers @ Stonecrest Mall in Lithonia, Ga. I ordered a big box meal with UNSWEET tea, I received sweet tea, a beef burrito that contained only cheese and sour cream,cinnamon twists that were stale and bitter from too much cinnamon and so sugar, a &quot;grilled&quot; flatbread sandwich that had never seen a grill and contained only lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, and a taco that did have some meat in it and was the only thing that was fit to eat. I know this can be done better because I have eaten at other Taco Bell&apos;s that present good food. Also I am a diabetic, so you should provide an alternative drink, besides Pespi, Pepsi makes me sick; you provided may drinks for aother people, how about adding diet. Dr Pepper for people who cannot drink Pepsi. 



 Sean 5/31/11 
 (North Augusta sc taco bell) we are avid taco bell customers however this location is not being managed. The orders are wrong 80% of the time. Today we ordered 4 items 3 were wrong. I went back to get it corrected. Only two were fixed the third was wrong again. The meal was slopped together and this is normal for this location. I don&apos;t want twists or free food. I want what I order prepared correctly as I paid for it the first time. I would like you to have a person at each store check every order before the customer gets it. You could call them managers! Or you could allow customers like myself to record video and send it to corporate for review on a corporate site where you will be able to implement an employee incentive program based on customer submitted experiences. iPhones are everywhere and can be a great tool if you chose to use it. Thanks to whomever started this site. Even if taco bell doesn&apos;t listen. Imodinson@yahoo.com

 I have been trying to find Taco Bell refried beans at grocery stores, but all that is sold is fat free. I want the original. Where are they? 



 nancy 6/1/11 
 I have been a customer at taco bell for quite a few years in Olney Illinois, I have always enjoyed their food I go thru drive thru, Here lately the food has been terrible I dont know what has happened to our taco bell barely any meat in the 3 chalupas, and I had a nacho supreme and all they did was drizzle very little nacho cheese over it was so disappointed, Please bring back the good food you use to serve so that I dont have to find another place to eat Thank You 



 5/27/11 
 I was just on my FaceBook page when I came across an ad for Taco Bell. The ad showed an American Flag with a taco in front of it and the words &quot;Happy Memorial Day&quot;. As a mother of a daughter killed while serving her country in Iraq, my family takes extreme offensive to wishing someone Happy Memorial Day. Memorial Day is a holiday of &quot;observation&quot; not &quot;celebration&quot;. It is when we honor those that made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country. There is nothing &quot;happy&quot; about Memorial Day. Due to this insulting and disrespecting ad, we will no longer be customers of Taco Bell and any subsidiaries/restaurants of your parent company. 



 5/29/11 
 Taco bell is going down hill. The service stinks...the burritos are so small and have no sauce even when you order them with extra sauce and cheese the burrito is still skinny as hell with only beans in it. Used to be my favorite fast food place to eat...now they SUCK! 



 chris christensen 5/20/11 
 i found a piece of plastic in my mexican pizza that i chocked on and had to pull it out with my fingers because it was lodged in my throat. the enployees started to laugh at me so i said thats not funny and one of the people wanted to fight me over it called me a the N word i told him that im not black so stop calling me that.
then he gave me the middle finger manager saw that and told him to go home he waited in the parking lot and wanted to fight so i called the police on him.
thanks toco bell

 John Huddleston 5/21/11 
 I went the Taco Bell in Taos, NM and the girl who took our order had two large purple hickies on her neck and her boyfriend was there near the register just hanging out! It took longer to get our order than any other Taco Bell I have ever been to before! After we received our order I notice that there was no hot sauce by the napkins so I kindly asked for mild and fire sauce which was pitched onto the tray with no acknowledgment whatsoever, this was my worst Taco Bell experience ever!

 Sitting here at hemes taco bell in front of target. The flora are so dirty you can barley see under tables. Looks like they have not been swept since last night. So gross. Tables are filthy and girls behind counter are just standing there waiting to take someones order. Very sad conditions for a newly remodeled restaurant

 What&apos;s really in your ...
Taco Bell Mexican Pizza

It&apos;s Italian, it&apos;s Mexican, it&apos;s ... well, it&apos;s got a whopping 64 different ingredients, so it&apos;s hard to tell just what exactly it is. On the face of it, this meal doesn&apos;t look too bad. There are two pizza shells, ground beef, beans, pizza sauce, tomatoes, and cheese. Even the nutritional vital signs, while high (540 calories, 30 grams of fat), compare favorably with most fast-food pizzas. It only gets scary when you zoom in on what it takes to stitch those pieces together. That&apos;s when you see all of those 64 small ingredients, including an astounding 24 in the ground beef alone. Yikes.

Now, some of those ingredients amount to little more than Mexican seasoning and spices, but there is a whole cluster of complex compounds such as autolyzed yeast extract, maltodextrin, xanthan gum, calcuim propionate, fumaric acid, and silicon dioxide. Any of those sound familiar? The last one might if you&apos;ve spent any time at the beach. But chances are you normally refer to it by its common name: sand. Why does Taco Bell put sand in the Mexican Pizza? To make it taste like spring break in Cancun? Not quite. As it turns out, Taco Bell adds silica to the beef to prevent it from clumping together during the shipping process.

Is it usual to add silica to food? Yes. is it dangerous? Probably not. The mineral actually occurs naturally in all sorts of food, including vegetables and milk. Of course, inhaling it is a different story. Construction workers who breathe in too much silica dust on the job can develop serious lung problems such as bronchitis or silicosis. Guess that&apos;s another reason to eat slowlyyou don&apos;t want to make the mistake of inhaling your silica. 



 Paola Montilla 5/17/11 
 Taco Bell is a good restaurant. The one in Belleville New Jersey is clean, the workers are nice and you&apos;re are treated politely. The only thing is, that it doesnt catch people&apos;s attention. The restaurant is what i call &quot;dead.&quot; Their&apos;s nothing invinting about it besides the food. In my opinion, not that you should do as i say, but your comercials should be more clever, and funny to catch all type of ages. You should have more things for kids besides &quot;a kids meal&quot;. Have some type of &quot;taco Cartoon Toy of the month&quot;. Something to get kids want to go to taco bell isntead of McDonalds. Let&apos;s face it, parents like to please their children and if they want taco bell , taco bell it is. Also, another idea is that you should make some type of &quot;play area&quot; , and have music playing in the restaurant so costumers wont be bored eating. I mean , if you had to choose between a fun restaurant where you have good food and entertainment, and a just-good-food-restaurant, most people are going to go with the first choice. Again, you don&apos;t have to listen to me these are just ideas, but i think they will definetly improve your restaurant (: thank you for listening, Paola Montilla

 Don&apos;t ever go to Taco Bell on Main Street in Danbury, CT. The service isn&apos;t terrible but the food is pretty bad. I&apos;ve never had a worse burrito in my life. 

 

 Chasity 5/14/11 
 Taco Bell location Norton, VA. Store 004765:
I am usually very pleased with our local Taco Bell, that has not been the case on my most recent visits. My last visit on May 13th 2011, I ordered two of the fresco chicken soft tacos and they ended up being beef. I know we are all only humans and mistakes are going to be made, but having two previous incidents where the exact same thing has happened is just unacceptable! One previous order on May 11th 2011, I ordered a grilled stuffed chicken burrito with no beans, I did recieve the grilled stuffed burrito with no beans but it had beef instead of chicken! Another previous order on May 7th 2011 I ordered four fresco chicken supremes and received beef in those. I work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes are common; but to the same person 3 times in one month may be grounds for an action plan! Maybe u should have employees repeating orders back to customers. 



 Chris Lehman 5/11/11 
 Decided to go inside Taco Bell for a change! Sorry I did. Went in with a friend, the only customers inside. Nobody jumped to get our order, then went to sit down in the dining room after giving my order. The floor was filthy and not one clean table. So, I went to get a napkin to wipe off a table and as I was going to sit back down I said &quot;this place is filthy!&quot; The floor in the food area was bad, and customers could see that. After I made the comment one of the employees did start wiping tables and sweeping the dining room. This was around 3:00 p.m.. I sit down and see the manager take his cap off, wipe his forhead with his hand and put his cap back on!!! Did not go to wash his hand!!! Never will go back to the Taco Bell in Sterling Colorado. Corporates do you care? I did visit with a gal from Loveland Colorado and she told me the Taco Bell in Loveland is the same way. 



 Daniel Bodily 5/6/11 
 i have eaten at taco bell since i have been a child and in my forty years i have never been treated with such disrespect as i have been from the Lebanon oregon taco bell to the point as i will never eat at taco bell again your company is in the service industry and when the employ&apos;s at this location are rude to the customers to the point of the manager&apos;s laughing at people making a complant about there order. futher more the store was filthy my kids could not even sit down because there was no place to sit and when we asked if some one could come clean us a place to sit i was told that if that&apos;s what i wanted to do it my self. i don&apos;t know what kind of place your corprat offices are running but you will never get my money again by the way we never got our order.

 We called your corporate office in regards to a VERY LARGE franchisee that owns over 60 Taco Bell locations. They are looking to obtain a voice/data solution that will support their business. We called your corporate to obtain the person(s) who we can speak with to get our voice/data solutions to be certified so that we can support your Francisee. We get forwarded to a voice system giving us a physical address to snail mail our paperwork to get the process started....REALLY???? REALLY??? How do you expect to support the very private business that support your cause financially if you cannot provide accessibility to your people? 



 B 5/10/11 
 Went thru drive thru order 2 rice, 2beans, side of beef and 2 crunchwrap. There wasn&apos;t even a hand full of beef in the bowl and the crunchwraps had nothing but a tiny bit of hamburger and cheese. I will never go to taco bell again. They are cheap on their ingredients. 



 JOY SULLIVAN 4/27/11 
 I applied for a job at taco bell in westlake ohio and had a interview and the lady said she doesnt like to hire black people and i dont think anyone should treat PEOPLE THAT WAY IM HIGHLY UPSET AND IM A VERY KIND PERSON. And everytime i go to this taco bell in westlake ohio the workers are very rude. 



 kathy 4/27/11 
 I went to taco bell today. My bill came to just over 11.00. They ring it up as 115.00. The clerk never even tell me, just calls, what I assume is the manager.

The &quot;manager&quot; makes ANOTHER mistake and credits my debit card back 1.04, then another 104.96.

So far the money has not been put back into my account. Beware! I did call corporate and I have to wait up to three business days. 



 pam 4/28/11 
 Taco Bell is wonderful place to dine. HOWEVER, one place in particular SUCKS! The manager SUCKS! His employees SUCK!

They cheat on content. They leave certain items out of certain items. Their tortillas are dry tough. Tortillas are waaay too large for meager amount of content!

Employee attitude is lousy. Manager is VERY weak and you get the impression he&apos;s trying to cut corners to look good on paper and cut overhead.

The guy once allowed the ENTIRE restaurant to fill with black choking smoke and wouldnt allow anyone to open the door to let it out - said it was against Corporate policy to leave the door open! DUH! The guy is a moron! 



 Tracy LaForest 4/29/11 
 I live behind your store on Clio Rd in Flint, Michigan. You had a company come in a year and a half ago to clean the lot that butts up to my back yard, I was over the moon. As I had offered to purchase the property, to make sure it was cleaned out, or at the very least, no longer used as a dump. You paid a pretty penny to have it done. On 4/29/2011 the company you had to do your Spring clean up, just dumped a ton of crap back there. It is worse than a bog. The standing water and molding leaves are stinking to high Heaven. I feel it is a health hazard and will have the Township out here to examine it again. I would have called the local Manager, but the local store number has been disconnected and the Regional Manager is not taking any calls. I hope the fine from the Township/City or County is not too high.

Your employee, said I should not yell at them and that he really did not need me to cause him to become &quot;heated&quot; (the young, blond man, who identified himself as Mr. Miller). He said, that he would be back at some point to cut down the trees that have grown up, but that the leaves and other trash, would be getting left there, garbage he just put there, mind you. Heated is not what I am, I am very tired of having to see, hear and smell the filth of your business. It is a disgusting. This needs to be addressed. 



 Leah Le May 4/29/11 
 Today I went to taco bell on thr corner of velp and memorial in green bay wi. I ordered TWO crunchy beef burritos. I stood and waited 15 min for them and didnt receive them still so I asked for.my money back. Mind you the employees were moving as slow as molasses on a winter day and not only that they were too intertwined in gossiping with each other. The shift manager didnt even say anything. There were two other complaints from people about them moving too slow, one mind you, was from another taco bell employee from a different location!! 



 s.lara 4/30/11

WHAT KIND OF MANAGER HUNGS UP THE PHONE ON A CUSTOMER! 



 tabbydee 5/3/11 
 Wheres the beef? Every Taco bell I go to puts very little meat even if I order extra it is still not enough. Was there a memo to back off of the meat? And most importantly, bring back the chilito (chili cheese burritos) they were awesome!!!!! 



 Kaitie 5/4/11 
 I paid for the extra sour cream and did not get it. Very mad. Tbell sucks. Sounds like they all need real managers. 



 Edna Trathen 4/25/11 
 Well I do like Tacos and such at Taco Bell. But where&apos;s the beef huh! All I get is cheese and lettuce and a tiny wee bit of meat. Now your picture advertisements are something else. I&apos;m a photographer, and I must say those pictures are great. Now I get to the Taco Bell and I know what I want, but when I look at my taco I am disapointed and hungry. So I have to go back up to the counter and show them the Taco and the burrito and say where&apos;s the beef. Then they make me another one. Why did&apos;nt they put the beef in when I ordered it? So I ask the person behind the counter, if I go into a hot dog joint that sells a foot long hotdog and they bring me a half a dog would I be satisfied? Hell no. So I say to her what if that was you and she said I want a whole dog. Yippie I close my case.

 scott 4/22/11 
 Why is it that taco bell can never get my order right? I ask for no lettuce and every time, every time they can&apos;t get that right. How hard is it to not put something on a taco? It should be easier! I will never go to the taco bell on 30th street in hutchinson, ks again. Your employees are incompetent, and I&apos;m surprised they&apos;re smart enough to tie their own shoes in the morning. I will take my business elsewhere from now on. 



 jason mims 4/18/11 
 I will never eat at taco bell again, I had the worst service of anyplace i have ever been. First it took almost 20 minutes to make my order which would be fine if 7 crewmwmbers where not there, and the reason it took so long, was because they kept leaveing the line to talk to there friends that where standing upfront. After i finally got my order all of it was not there. My son wanted a Double Decker Chessy taco, that i paid for and they gave him a soft taco instead. I have been a customer of taco bell for years but no longer the service in desloge mo. is horrible and neither me, my, family, or anyone i know will ever go back. 



 Walter Barratt 4/20/11 
 Went in to make an order for some food and was looking up at the menu board. My eyes dropped for a moment and saw that the workers in the back were preparing food. A big pot was being filled with beans and while filling the pot it overturned and fell to the floor. The worker just went ahead and scooped it up off the floor and continued to heat the pot up. Needless to say that is when I immediately left that place and found some place else to eat. I don&apos;t thing I will even again go to Taco Bell to enjoy a meal. The rating of one star was too much to give them. I wish that I could have given them a rating of zero stars. 



 Thomas Zoyhofski 4/20/11 
 On April 15, 2011 I went to the Taco Bell in Seabrook, Texas for a taco. When I opened it up the tortilla had mold on it. I was so disgusted!! I immediately took it back to the store and asked to speak to a manager. I showed him the taco and he grabbed it out of my hands and threw it in the trash and asked if I wanted something else. I said yes, my money back! he didn&apos;t apologize or even acknowledge the fact that they were serving rotten food!! This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever patronized, always messing up my orders, service is horrible, but we continued to go back, never again!! My family and I will never eat there again, and I plan to advertise this as much as possible so everyone is aware of the lack of ethics at this store!! I will also be contacting someone at headquarters in reference to this matter.

 It seems that Taco Bell is best at false advertisement. On Monday 4/18/11 a commercial ran during the Coyote/Red Wing&apos;s hockey game that whenever the Coyotes played at home there would be a SPECIAL of 12 taco&apos;s for $7.00. 4th game of the playoffs were Wednesday night 4/20/11 ~ we decided to have a few friends over and grab some taco&apos;s for the game since Coyotes were playing on home ice probably for the last time during the playoffs. Went to Taco Bell at 1061 N. Dobson Rd (In Mesa Riverview)Mesa, AZ at 6:40 p.m. ~ waited in line only to be told they weren&apos;t &quot;doing that special anymore&quot;. Asked them what do you mean your not doing it anymore? Shift Mgr&apos;s (George)response: We stopped doing that 2 weeks ago, they were suppose to pull the commercial. Well guess what George, they didn&apos;t! Even after standing in line, George wouldn&apos;t honor their special, got the number for Headquarters and left. Went to Subway than home to watch the game. What is really irritating is the commercial ran TWICE last night during the game, still promoting a special that their restaurant is NOT HONORING.. My money spends everywhere and from now on it will spend ANYWHERE OTHER THAN Taco Bell.

 Thursday, March 31, 2011 I visited the Taco Bell in Kingdom City, Mo. The best experience I have ever had at a Taco Bell. I was greeted upon arriving at this location although there were several customers in front of me. I placed my order and the clerk was very friendly, polite and Thanked me for coming in. When they called my number I went to the counter to get my order and the employee stayed with the tray of food and once again Thanked me for coming and said enjoy your lunch. As I was eating and doing some business on the phone I noticed that the two clerks waiting on customers staying very busy. When they weren&apos;t helping a customer they were cleaning the tables, checking the trash, stocking, etc. One of them even asked &apos;Is there anything else I can get for you today. I left the restaurant only to return to ask for the manager. She greeted me and I asked for the corp. number. She was very concerned and wanted to resolve any issue. When I explained how impressed I was with the service and cleanliness of her store. She said Thank You and turned around and gave the recognition to the employees with hy-fives and way to go girls. I just thought someone at the corporate office should be made aware of this. I will visit the Taco Bell in Kingdom City every time I pass thru. They should be commended for a job will done. Sincerely, Lisa Adams

 I have been to the 8760 Wadsworth Blvd., Arvada, CO Taco Bell many times and the orders were always correct and good. However, in the last few months or so, this Taco Bell cannot get a single order correct. Three times I ordered a burrito with green chili and extra onions and three times it came with Red Sauce and hardly any onions. I called Teresa the manager at the store and she apologized and promised that if I do come back and mention this, that she would make sure the order was correct. Well, it did come with Green Chili and Extra Onions, except the sauce and onions were all on one end of the burriro, the rest was just beans. Is this the equivalent of spitting in my burrito? If you have to add the right ingredients, you have to spoil the burrito in some way just to make me more mad? Anyway, I will NEVER, NEVER go to a Taco Bell again.

 My husband and I just left the taco bell here in Tucson AZ 3455 e grant location where it was very obvious that there was illegal activity going on involving the staff and several associates outside the store. First our order was wrong and we had to go back in to get what they forgot - the container of cheese for nachos and both our tacos - which was half the order. Then to top it off there was NO meat on the chalupa!! When we went in to get our money back, we got the run around &quot;do you have a receipt? The bag was in my effin hand!!! When my husband stated they should lay off the cocaine - which was VERY obvious due to the activity both inside and outside the store- one staff became irate and started threatening us and him and several staff followed us out of the store continuing to threaten us! I will be making a phone call to corporate tomorrow!!!

 Mark Williams 4/2/11 
 Teresa - The District Manager; Shouldn&apos;t had, Fired the Manager &quot;David&quot; on the spot, in front of all the employees&apos; and customers; like me. &quot;Today.&quot;
That bothered me a lot, because I&apos;ve been going to this store since it&apos;s built, a few years ago. I&apos;ve been a faithful customer since then and got to know all its employees.
Having to grow with them, and Manager &quot;David&quot; this last year; made it hard for me now, to understand why!!! Teresa replaced him.... when I see the best Manager ever go. He works well with others, great with customers, very kind hearted. You can go in that store and know that all the employees are very proud to work with him, The Best.

My name is Mark J. Williams, I&apos;ve lived in this town for 45years, had nieces&apos; and nephews that inspired me to this store, 5 and 4 years ago. With &quot;David&quot; not there, its like the family is destroyed.

As a concerned individual, i would like to know why? Was it a feud between Teresa and employees?
Teresa and David? Or Is just Teresa with her own intentions? Maybe she doesn&apos;t work well with others.

 If I could of put in 0 stars I would have
My comment is for your store in Athens Georgia and your unethetical firing practices of my sister who has worked for your corpoation in one way or another for over 30 years, and in that 30 years her honest and hard work was always rewarded with trips and bonusus and now all of a sudden she gets a new assistant manager whom her manager says to trust with the inventory . Within 6 months times of him starting to work there the inventory is off and she loses her job and he is promoted to her position. Not only does she lose her job Taco bell refuses her unemployment tarnes her good name and good work record, in favor of this person who was kicked out of three other stores.
please expain to me how you can treat a loyal employee of all those years and excellent service in such a way 



 Martha Clevenger 3/31/11 
 I sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes at the place where you place your order at the taco bell/ kfc in Gadsden, AL. Then when they finally decided to take my order they said I&apos;m sorry we don&apos;t have the triple layer nacho anymore, would you like to try our supreme nacho? I said no I&apos;m a veggeterrian and don&apos;t eat meat and how is it that a taco bell not too far away has the triple layer nacho still???!!!? 



 tbel 4/1/11 
 taco bell, has the worse food ever.i tried the taco,s that i,m been hearing so much about so i said let me try one to see what all the talks about,and i have to say there taco taste like garbage.i mean watery runny meat tasted awful.i have a friend that told me a while back how bad taco bell food had gotten.and said he wrote a letter to the corp office and ask if they would go back to the way they use to make taco back in the early 70,s and they sent him a really shitty letter back saying if you dont like the food basiclly eat some where else most people i will never ever eat at taco bel again i mean ever the attitudes are just as bad as there food...................... dont know what dog food taste like but this food has really gone down hill. 



 Taco&apos;s 3/27/11 
 I dare you to ha a corporate official go through the drive through at a taco bell in Alaska and order a hard shell taco. It SUCKS the amount of meat you get is like a table spoon full. Give me a break are times that tuff for your company. Thanks Dennis from Alaska @ bigdjohnson77@gmail.com 



 Jason Carr 3/27/11 
 Went to Taco Bell in Loveland, CO. at the Centera shops&amp;ordered a gordita meal to go. When I took a bite, all I tasted was the shell. I opened my gordita&amp;they only put not even a spoon full of meat in the food. I returned my meal. However, I gave this location a second chance as I thougth it was a honest mistake. Same result. Paying more for less doesn&apos;t make since. I have many Clientele in and out of my office&amp;know we refuse to do business with taco bell. As a m.b.a. student as well, I always put in a negative word about how Taco Bell saves money on ripping of consumers hard earned money. It&apos;s great to deter people from Corporations whom you know are soley in it for profit and not meeting the consumers needs. Taking short cuts at the expense of consumers. Unethical business pratices. 



 Betty 3/18/11 
 The taco bell in moore, oklahoma on 12th street is the worst restaurant. The employees are rude . There is a big fat guy with a goty who works the drive thru who is very rude .the manager doesnt care .the whole staff is rude and have an attitude. I will never eat there again 



 Dr.peters 3/18/11

 Sally McKinley 3/19/11 
 After 3 times ordering and paying for a steak flatbread sandwich, I finally was given one in my order. I live 20 minutes away from our local taco bell in Findlay, Ohio (Tiffin Ave. Store) so when I get home and it&apos;s not in the bag, I don&apos;t go back to retrieve the missing items. This time I finally had one of the flatbread sandwiches. I was completely disappointed in the size and lack of meat inside. The advertisements show this great big sandwich sitting next to a drink, filled with meat and cheese. Mine was smaller and skinnier than a soft taco. Shouldn&apos;t it have steak meat over the entire piece of flatbread? I had about 4 tiny pieces of steak in the middle. I expected it to be as big as a footlong sub because that is what the advertisement shows. I won&apos;t be back anytime soon. 



 Fed Up 3/21/11 
 Well here&apos;s another to add to your complaint file. This one is about the Taco Bell in Indianapolis off of 56th and Georgetown Road. I think there needs to be a complete change out of all employees. Talk about incompetence. They just can&apos;t seem to get the logistics of the whole thing right. When you go there, no matter what time of day or week, you wait in the drive-thru for long periods of time, even when there&apos;s no one there but you. It never fails! It&apos;s takes 10 to 15 minutes to get 2 people through! When you finally get your order it&apos;s either wrong or poorly made. I understand stuff happens every once and awhile, but this is the norm. They will no longer get my business!
 



 ANN KARL 3/15/11 
 I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT A WONDERFUL MANAGER YOU HAVE AT YOUR HOBART INDIANA BRANCH. HER NAME WAS KELLY. MY DAUGHTER WAS ON A SCHOOL TRIP TO FLORIDA AND THE BUS HAD STOPPED THERE FOR A BITE TO EAT. SHE FORGOT HER COLUMBIA JACKET ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR. I CALLED THE NEXT DAY TO SEE IF THEY HAD THE JACKET. I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I WAS LIVING IN WISCONSIN AND THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS ON HER WAY TO FLORIDA. SHE ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS. SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO MAIL THE JACKET BACK TO ME. I RECIVED IT 2 DAYS LATER. THANK YOU! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU! 



 Jamie Jones 3/16/11 
 My name is Jamie Jones. My sister is Brandy Jones. The Taco Bell she works at is located on Auburn Way South in Auburn, WA.
Brandy has worked at this Taco Bell for some three yrs. now. I recently moved up from Pennsylvania, and I thought it was going to be good to see my sister again after many years apart.
The reason I am leaving this message is because Brandy is up for a promotion and I feel she doesn&apos;t deserve it. Why, since being here in WA. I have learned that my sister, Brandy, is currently using meth and marijuana. She is also taking prescription pills paid for illegally. I&apos;m appalled that Taco Bell does not do urine test on the employees. I&apos;m also concerned that she is working with the public knowing she is positive for hepatitis c.
I hope and that this issue is resolved very soon. I&apos;m not capable of calling the cops. So I hope the right eyes see this and takes the proper measures to serve the right punishments for her problems and deceit.Please to whom it may concern, take immediate action and bring the proper authority to place her in the custody of the police.

Thank you for your time.

 I love taco bell but your on 11 commerce way seekonk ma. I went there on 16 at 430 pm I was waiting for five minutes the manger was too busy throwing. Papers at the girl. Working he wouldn&apos;t take my order he said bye to me and smerk 

 

 Carolyn 3/13/11 
 For once, Taco Bell has done something right! The person who handled my order at the drive-thru window was very courteous and even took the second it takes to read my name on my debit card so that he could personally thank me, by name, for visiting his store. My order? Absolutely perfect! The team that made it was outstanding! This is the store located on 31st Street in Temple, TX. This guy who was working the drive-thru is a rare jewel and should be training others on how customer service should be done. I&apos;ll be writing a personal letter directly to corporate. Hopefully someone there will take what I write to heart. 



 Susan Wilson 3/13/11 
 LOVE your food and have for many years...however, your commercial I just saw makes me sad. It appears yours advertising department has decided to promote apparent one night stands. Of course, that happens in the real world. There are still some of us in this world who are trying to teach their children that&apos;s not what is best. Is this what the Taco Bell&apos;s employees who are parents want for their children? Unlikely. Is it really necessary to include that in their advertising? Again, I love Taco Bell. That&apos;s what I craved when I was pregnant with my first child. I will no longer eat there and neither will the rest of my family if I continue to see this poor example of role modelling in their advertising... 



 Austin Bramble 3/7/11 
 Taco Bell Store # 002372 You claim your meat is 88% beef and 22% seasoning. I wouldn&apos;t know because the last three times I&apos;ve been to this store I haven&apos;t received any meat at all on my taco&apos;s. The pizza besides having no meat was broken not cut, was all over the box as if it was held upside down actually seeping out the box, and when I did try to eat it the beans were hard and crusty. My brother on the other hand got the wrong order and it sucked as well!! The service at this Taco Bell has never been desirable. They are dirty, rude, and really don&apos;t give two craps about Customer Service. I don&apos;t think they know what Customer Service&amp;cleanliness is! Don&apos;t you have managers? I am trying to get a refund but they won&apos;t give it. I will be seeing the day manager tomorrow! Store # 002372 Oaklyn New Jersey, Reg 4 order #308 cashier 500 Drive thru. I want to speak to someone at corporate My e-mail is jstyfymythug1 @ aol. com
 



 Very unhappy 3/9/11 
 I had a horrible experience at the Altamonte Springs FL location on 436. I was stuck in the drive through for over 40 minutes!!!! Then when I finally got to the window I was told they were out of mild sauce...I just can&apos;t eat their food unless it is covered with sauce. Needless to say. I drove off after wasting my valuable time without any food. This was by far the worst &quot;fast food&quot; experience of my life!!! 



 R. Dixon 3/4/11 
 Pocatello Idaho.
Purchased food for a cub scout troop. (11 kids, 2 adults). $60 order. Got the food back to the house and I had half of the order missing. Immediately returned to the store; its a 10 minute drive, and showed them the receipt and the bag. The man at the cash register asked if I was sure we hadn&apos;t eaten the taco&apos;s prior to returning. (It had been 15 minutes since I had gotten the food) I asked to speak to the manager. I got a young looking girl (early 20s) who listened and said they would make the taco&apos;s. I waited 10 more minutes, went back up to the counter and mentioned that I needed to get back to the house and feed the troop. The manager ROLLED her eyes at me and said &quot;there ARE other customers.&quot; I replied &quot;How many of those customers have had to make a return trip to correct YOUR mistake, and been kept waiting?&quot; Her response was &quot;Fine, then just give her a refund,&quot; to the cashier. I got my money back and went through KFC. HORRIBLE customer service. 



 Cathy M 3/4/11 
 Last night (March 3, 2011) at 6:27 pm we went to the drive thur at Taco Bell in Wallace, NC. When the girl at the window finally seemed to understand what we were ordering, we pulled up to the window and was ask to pull around to the other side and someone would bring out our food, of course this was after we paid for it. When we pulled around, there was at least four or five cars waiting and within minutes the line grow behind us. The line inside the store was backed up to the door, and no one coming out. Finally one of the employee&apos;s came out with a bag of food, but no one had ordered what he had in the bag. Unfortunately this happened repeatedly. I started to go in and get our money back and was meet at the door be another customer who had gone into get his money back, he said save my time that he tired and the manager would not come to the counter to discuss the problem. By this time people were backing out of the drive thur. At 6:48 we finally drove off without our food or money back as we had to be in a meeting at 7:00. As a one business owner to another, perhaps you should consider the status of this facility. This is the worst advertisement for Taco Bell. 



 3/4/11 
 I worked at taco bell in 2010. I simply called to ask if the tax forms have been sent out, and the manager on the phone was terribly rude. Told me not to be calling during rush hour and then hung up on me. Its for this reason i see why taco bell cant keep good workers and the turn overrate is high.Well in London, oh anyways. Not only am i glad i no longer work there i will also never be eating there again. THANX LONDON OH FOR OPENING MY EYES 



 Tricia Smith 3/4/11 
 The Taco Bell on Kissimmee Park Rd, Saint Cloud, FL is one of the worst stores I have ever been to. I have been several times, one time I took the food back to the store and so were other people and that was after waiting 20 minutes to get it. I gave the a second chance today and on the menu the price was listed at 2.89 and I was charged 2.99. When I got home there was no napkins or fork/spoon in the bag. I guess that is how they make there money. Not mine, not anymore. 



 ronnie marino 3/5/11 
 you use to have the best barritos, Where &apos;s the GREEN sauce. Why did you get rid of the green sauce . 



 3/7/11 
 Try getting shrimp tacos..I was told the wait time was 20 min! Does this sound like fast food ??? So wataburger it was,easy decision because they dont false advertise!! 



 unknown 3/1/11 
 Dear taco bell, for starters your commercials are misleading prices and closing wise. i live in beckley wv and the taco bell closes at 10:45 when they have a sign up that says 1am or later. and also the quad steak is something i will never eat again. i told an employ there tht i have developed an reaction and ask to speak with the manager. she leaves then later comes back and says tht the manager is to buissy to talk with me and i look and see the manager hitting on one of the female employees if this is the way you get buissness and get your qworkers layed im never going back. thnks to the manager who DIDNT HAVE TIME TO SPEAK WITH ME BUT COULD FLIRT WITH THE EMPLOYEES. my throat is now swollen just cause i couldnt get the ingridents. 



 Ms. Hill 3/3/11 
 To Whom It May Concern

I am a person that has patronized Taco Bell,
since it&apos;s beginning in the 70&apos;s. Yet, I have
never at any time had the insensitive treatment
that I and my family had at your Taco Bell, Located
at: 8000 Providence Rd., Charlotte, N. C..

The service both from the daytime manager, and window
help, and staff prep people on 3/3/11 was less
than acceptable. Their attitue, the packaging, and
products were all unacceptable. No more than an a
teaspoon of meat,a couple (sliver&apos;s of lettuce,
as well as cheese) were in each of our 10 taco&apos;s.

They may think this is being funny to do to the
unspecting drive up cars, but being a business
person myself, I find no humor in this.

No sauce was offered with my order, and I had to
circle the building to get the packages. The smart
mouthed,nasty attitue manager said &quot;you have to ask
for sauce with your order. I have always been asked
when driving up to order ... would I like &quot;hot, mild,
or fire sauce.


I am very reluctant to patronize this establishment
and will tell others to be careful if they do so.
 



 Lisa Holcomb 2/26/11 
 I have always loved Taco Bell!! I even got a after school job at TB when I was in high school. I also have 6 yrs as a manager in TB. I have not work for taco bell in the last few yrs. My family loves eating there. I have to say the taco bell in our town(Trenton, GA) is one of the worst I have ever seen. I keep going there hoping something would change but leave unhappy. I have done the opinionprot.com and I still see nothing changing. I have called and talk to every manager there. The last Manager I talk to started talking to the crew members while I was still on the phone with him and not once said Im sorry or how can I fix this. 



 Captain Robert Barrett 2/27/11 
 Tonight I went into the Taco Bell near my home and tied to order some dinner. As I stood at the counter trying to make my order, several friends of the employee and man in charge this evening were all speaking to each other in a very loud and rude manner. They were so loud and rude and the employee lady at the counter did not even understand what I ordered and did it all improperly. I asked for the man in charge and told the friends there at the counter being so rude, to be not so loud that I cannot get my order in. They then wanted to start a fight with me and the man there in charge seemed to be friends with them and would not help me at first. I then just requested my payment to be refunded and he and his pals kept being rude and threatening me to go outside and fight. I refused a fight and called the police. The man in charge then refused to give me his name and told me to leave. I refused to leave until the police arrived. I was being threatened by his friends there causing this problem in the first place. He then finally gave me my money back and again told me to go, but I refused until police officer finally did arrive. At that time I tried to explain it all to the officer and, of coarse, they all stuck together and denied everything they did and the man in charge told the police officer an incorrect expanation to cover his pals. He then told the police that I had to go and would not serve me correctly.
This incident happened about 8:30 pm tonight at the Taco Bell on 4th Street North and about the 36oo address. This is not an acceptable business opperation for any business and the situation needs to be something done about right away.
The Police officer involved is PFC Brian Lynch and I will go to report it all at the police station also tomorrow morning. I do expect some reconsideration on this event and the man in charge there with his pals while normal customers try to place an order. I do hope to recieve some response on the report I am notifying you of tonight.
Sincerely, Captain Robert Barrett

 Taco Bell in Las Cruces, NM inside Truckstops of America

I recently drove from Las Angeles to Jacksonville and I always stop in the TA&apos;s (Truckstops of America) to shower and refuel. Well I walked into the Taco Bell located inside and I found one of the friendliest faces I have ever seen. The young lady behind the counter was very polite and even greeted me as I walked in. Her name was Kim. I was unsure as to what I wanted and she suggested the burrito supremes, letting me know she had a 2 for 5 deal. She even described what came in the burritos and made them sound so delicious. The other young lady that was working with her, I think her name was Tony, was equally hospitable. I paid the young lady, got my receipt and I didnt even make it to fill my drink cup and my food was ready and very delicious might I add. I was surprised because I had never received such great service and in such a timely manner. These two young ladies deserve a thank you call from Taco Bell&apos;s head office. Every person I know who drives the same route will stop and eat at that Taco Bell. Thank u again ladies!! 



 Rena Perez 2/25/11 
 About one month ago i sat down to eat my taco, which i have been craving since finding out i was pregnant, I unwrapped my taco to take a bite when i looked down before i bit into it, i saw a big black beetle crawling across my cheese. Ever since then i have been traumatized and look at everything I put into my mouth before eating it. I will never ever go to Taco Bell again, especially the Taco Bell on North Main st. in Salinas California. I have been trying to call Taco bell to let them know, but have been unsuccessful. All i get is a recording! I never thought that kind of thing would happen to me. I mean i hear stories about it, but i thought they were just stories.

 Steve Larkin 2/11/11 
 this is america! Give the consumer what they order and what they expect when they order. What you advertise and what we recieve are not the same. You are driving away customers by trying to skimp on ingredients. What the hell. Be honest. Oh well. No I dont feel better, I feel I&apos;m cheated every time I go to your store.

 I went to the taco bell in clarksville tn i payed for my order at 11:55am and at 12:25 i finally got what i thought was all of my order. I didn&apos;t just get food for me but for the guys i work with. When i got back to work and went to get my food i found part of my order missing i ordered 13 items and 1 drink so it was not a small orer, I will not go back. If they cant get my order right after waiting over 30 min then they need to have the big boss come down and clean house and get people in there that do want a job and can get it right. So you will know exactly what store I&apos;m talking about the store number is 022800 the cashier was very apologetic Dana k for the lack of her co workers ability to do there job. i tried to call the regional manager Shaun Southworth and could not get through all i herd was this number was not a valid number and its the number on the recite 931-731-8714. If corporate would like to contack me they can send a e-mail to kelly.barber@ferguson.com

 I can&apos;t believe you are still in business,the taco bell at 8160 transit Rd in Amherst NY is the worst taco bell in NY I ordered 3 tacos at the drive thru and they were cold and had very little meat,this is not the 1st problem I&apos;ve had there,I will be calling the corporate office tomarrow to ask for a refund and will take my business somewhere else,I am thoroughly disgusted with the way you conduct business with the consumer,you are not the only taco restaurant in town! 



 TiredOfMorons 2/2/11

 Daphney Sims 2/5/11 
 I am so upset. I stoped by Taco Bell/ KFC today after being in the house for alomost 2 weeks from surgery...I was on my way to pick up my husband from work with my 2 children in the car. I purchase almost a $20.00 order. I decided to try my favorite the Chicken Casadia # T7 I believe on my way to get him. I bit into it about 3 tries..It was delicious..but then something poked me in my mouth and I immediatly spit it out. It was a piece of Wire Copper in Color. I don&apos;t know what the heck it was. I went back to tell the Manager at the Taco Bell and she state. I don&apos;t know do you want another one? I was like know I want you to know what I found and she said. It is not my fault I make them I don&apos;t process the meat. She then said she was sorry and she took down my name, address and phone number. I was so scared cause I had just had a surgery on my stomach 2weeks ago..I don&apos;t know if any of this stuff got in my system. I am going to have to contact a lawyer or something if nothing is done about it. Daphney Joliet, IL. 



 Steve R 1/29/11 
 The last time I went to taco bell for a meal the meat tasted rotten, like it was cooked over a year ago, and the texture of the veggies was as if it came from a garbage can by some homeless hobo. You guys need to straighten your act out and give your consumers a meal worth the price you charge. In the mean time I&apos;ll just go somewhere else for lunch. 



 kenny 1/18/11 
 why dont you tell seniors that you offer discounts when cashing out at the register.

we found this out by accident by telling the cashier, ( this is a senior meal ). the girl then pulled out a credit type card from the register and swiped it. It discounted my meal by approximately .60.

if you don&apos;t make mention to this discount, no one know about it.

 Carolyn Terry 1/21/11 
 Thank you so much for withdrawing your sponsorship of the new MTV series &quot;Skins&quot;. America needs more companies like yours with gutsy courage to place the welfare of it&apos;s children above corporate profit. You have a new customer, the Terry family. 



 haydi 1/21/11 
 i love taco way toooooooooooooooo much but i havnt one in my area i live beside mercy hospital and the hall of fame i wish u open one in this area its good chance by the way there are two places for sale try to use them 



 Donna Gorman 1/21/11 
 I am happy to see that taco bell pulled out of advertising for the MTV show &quot;skins&quot;! Thank you! 



 Gerald Zirnstein 1/22/11 
 While I generally like Taco Bell food and service, I am writing to complain about the Taco Bell sponsorship for the teen television series &quot;Skins&quot; which shows young teens lees that 18 years old having sex. Please keep the sleazy stuff for the adults. If you continue to be associated with this show I will not take my family there to eat any longer. Grow up and become responsible, like a lot of lazy slacker teens need to do also.

 Deborah Stephens 1/22/11 
 My husband went to Taco Bell for the 5.00 box and they said they were out of the boxes. I asked him to get a Taco Salad. They were out of shells. This is ridiculous. I&apos;m in Birmingham, Alabama, Ensley. It is awful in the black community. Who do you have managing these restaurants? Why do you go to restaurants in black communities and they do not know how to talk to people? Do you teach your employees any customer service? 



 Mike Rockefeller 1/23/11 
 Dear Taco Bell.....
I am a 5th grade student in Chagrin Falls (Bainbridge), Ohio. My friends and I really like Taco Bell and we are saving our money to open up a Taco Bell close to our home.

Our class has been asked to write to a business and I have chosen Taco Bell, please watch for my letter.

Sincerely,
Mike Rockefeller 



 Judy Gaboury 1/23/11 
 Thank you Taco Bell for having the backbone to drop the MTV show &quot;Skin&quot; from your sponsorship. It is refreshing to see companies still have some integrity. Way to go!! 



 Steve 1/25/11 
 The law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis&amp;Miles. filed a lawsuit in my name by way of the term ?all others similarly situated, and the general public? as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Taco Bell regarding the ground beef mixture in their products. As an active and very happy Taco Bell customer, I am asking the law firm to cease and desist from using the term &quot;and the general public&quot;. Furthermore, if the lawsuit in question results in an increase of a single penny of any of the Taco Bell products containing the ground beef mixture, I expect that the law firm mentioned will pay myself and &quot;all others similarly situated, and the general public&quot; the difference in price caused by any actions Taco Bell had to take in response to the law suit to include any legal costs incurred, any adjustments to said mixture on the menu, and any costs incurred in an effort to change their print, Internet, and multimedia messaging. The damages should be treble for the Beefy 5 layer Burrito because it is truly a national treasure at the price of $.89 each. I am also asking for this petition to be cast as a cause for the federal government under the concept of &quot;promoting the general welfare&quot; of the nation with the ability of this single menu item to feed millions of Americans who do not enjoy the ability to skim millions in profits as do the parasitic lawyers at Beasley Allen. We look forward to the immediate removal of all references to &quot;and the general public from your list of plaintiffs in the lawsuit or we will rally the public around Taco Bell with the rallying cry of &quot;recordar el fornido cinco burrtio capa!!!&quot;to bring attention to how ridiculous this suit is. Will you take the case on behalf of the general public? 



 debra greenwood 1/27/11 
 I went to taco bell in knoxville to pick up lunch for myself and my husband. I own a salon across the pike and we were replacing the floor in the salon and just wanted a quick lunch. I ordered 2. Regular tacos and a bean burrito and my husband got 5 soft tacos. I did not receive one of my tacos but the big deal was the bean burrito. As I bit into it I felt a differnt texture in my mouth. Thinking it was a dry hard end of the shell I continued to try to eat it. As I started to swallow I got chocked and my husband had to pull the object from the back of my throat. It was a piece of the multipurpose baggie about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide that had been cut off their food bag. When I took it back over to show them they were very complaicent about the issue and even told me that the itme was not somethingfrom theior store untiol one houng woman spokle up and said it was the corner of the multiopurpose baggie. I was astpounded at their attitude almopst blaming me and deniong that it was somethiongrom their store as if I were lying. Io was enraged. Sorry about the typos. My phone is havingf issues 



 chastity 1/27/11 
 Store in shelbyville ky. When I get off work and get to taco bell its usually bout 945 or 10. Every time the lobby is closed. Even though there sign says lobby open til 11. And I can&apos;t take my vehicle threw drive thru. Over a weeks time uve lost 20 $ only from me, and your turning away a lot of business from a lot of others to. I will not try again I&apos;m tired of never being able to get anything. 



 Dick 1/28/11 
 I am 73 and LOVE Taco Bell, Hate Lawyers. Go get them.
I do not care what percent of beef it is, taste excellent.
Attorneys are full of Bull xxxx...

The lawsuit, filed by the Alabama law firm Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis&amp;Miles, doesn&apos;t specify what percentage of the mixture is meat. But the firm&apos;s attorney Dee Miles said the firm had the product tested and found it contained less than 35 percent beef. The firm would not say who tested the meat or give any other specifics of the analysis.

Taco Bell says its seasoned beef contains 88 percent USDA-inspected beef and the rest is water, spices and a mixture of oats, starch and other ingredients that contribute to the &quot;quality of its product.&quot; The company said it uses no extenders. 

 

 Todd Henkin 1/26/11 
 I am disturbed about about your mix meat product that you call all beef. There is a lawsuit filed againt your company and your company should do the right thing and admit you are wrong. The people in america and around the world want good products and heathy food not made in test tube.
Advice: New beef product made of 100% beef, advertise your change. If not, trust me your company will fall like a rock. 



 KT in P-Town 1/26/11 
 This comment is for TB&apos;s C.E.O. who was quoted saying &quot;TB only buys their meat from well respected farmers like Tyson&quot;. If you think companies like &quot;Tyson chicken&quot; are well respected you are as misinformed as the rest of the lemmings!! No wonder I haven&apos;t eaten &quot;TOXIC HELL&quot; in years! It&apos;s GROSS!! which makes me ask; &quot;WHERES THE BEEF&quot;? 



 Edwin 1/16/11 
 I live in Ft. worth Tx, and every time I order the Five buck special they put two much lettice or tomato and a tea spoon of meat. Then when you ask for meat on your b-bfcr they say it&apos;s extra for what they didn&apos;t put on there in the first place. Taco Bell needs to train their employee&apos;s on how to make it right the first time and not charge their custumers extra money.
 



 Bonnie Hornaday 1/3/11 
 Your store in Siler City, NC....SUCKS.....being a combo Taco Bell / KFC never has any items we go in for whether its taco stuff or chicken....and when they do have what I want the shell is empty...my first job was at Taco Bell in Chesapeake, Va...I worked there for several years, even attended the world series of speed and accuracy....we made the food fast and the weight was correct....so it deff upsets me when I order a taco and there is very little meat,little lettuce and a few pieces of cheese...and just think..they dont have to shred lettuce, cheese, cook and drill beans.....what would they do if they had to do it old school, preparing everything in store......why can they not have the inventory they need to sell what the public wants when they want it...instead of telling you sorry were out???????????? I DO WANT TO SEND AN ACCOMIDATION TO THE TACO BELL IN RANDLEMAN, NC....EXCELLENT FOOD, SERVICE, CLEANLINESS, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT IN THE RESTURANT, IT IS ONLY 20 MILES TO GET THERE.....SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IN SILER CITY, NC....CLOSE THE DAMN THING AND WE CAN GO TO ASHEBORO OR RANDLEMAN....IF THEY CANT GET INVENTORY TO RUN A STORE....AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME BECAUSE MY HUSBAND, DAUGHTERS, FATHER AND MOTHER IN LAW....LOVE TACO BELL..... 



 Helen M Naysmith 1/3/11 
 Hi,
My husband and I freguent Taco Bell, # 022923 at least once a week. This is located in Jacksonville, Al. We stopped there today, Jan 3, 2011, and had lunch. Our order was # 279. I noticed the woman who was calling out the filled order numbers also was working by the torlillas or wraps. She dropped a spatula on the floor and then proceeded to pick it up and use it WITHOUT cleaning
I was shocked.
I called the store at 2:00 pm, and asked for the manager, shortly after we left and got into our vehicle. I felt this needed to be taken a step farther.

Thank You.
Sincerely,
Helem M. Naysmith.
 



 mikkel 1/6/11 
 I always enjoy eating at your restaurants I also buy taco bell stuff at the store I would like to see your nacho cheese sold at stores also as I can not find a cheese that&apos;s as good as yours my email is kmike94@aol.com don&apos;t no of anyone really reads these but hopefully I will hear from you 



 1/7/11 
 Taco Bell in Petal, MS is the worst Taco Bell in the nation. They have rodents in the store I my food was cold, I just threw my food in the trash it was pitiful and when I complained to the mgr. Raven she would not give me a refund. I also saw an employee trying to sell drugs to a people outside of the store. This store should be shut down. 



 Kyle border 1/9/11 
 Wish I could give it negtive stars the store 11000 se oak in milwaukie oregon is the worsr store ive ever been to the store is constantly understaffed for how many patrons it seems to have which amazing considering not only how,long the wait is consistently I understand having goals but putting of customers who come inside is crazy theres almost never workers making food on both sides I waited almost 12 minutes for a grilled stuffed burrito and only two other orders which were also small ahead of me this might not mattet much in a multimillon per store industrie but judging by tje reviews ive read thats slowly coming to an end 



 concerned customer 1/10/11 
 l dont no where to start .there food is nasty you say something your afraid there going to spit on it . the manager sandy is very rude you ask for the regenal boss they say no. so i had to go to another taco bell to get that info and i no for a fact that this store has hired empl and new that the were drug abuser i dont no what you policy is but you should drug test at least (eric ewart)and some of the others there. if nothing is done about this i will make it my mission to get the word to everone. to no the nasty little secrets from this store an others just like it. this taco bell is (located brevard rd in asheville nc 28806) this will be posted on every website i find till somthing done. ps MR TACO BELL i would suggest you get some one on it very quick .mayby try to save some face around this area 



 Nick 1/11/11 
 Please for the love of god put more cheese on the crunchy taco! Maybe its just the store in valdosta ga, on bemiss road, im not sure. All i know is that when i open the wrapper, i sea an ocean of green lettuce and only a very small amount of shredded cheese. We&apos;re talkin like, maybe 4 little pieces of cheese. Com e on taco bell, you can do better than that. 



 DAVE MIDDLETON 1/11/11 
 JANUARY 11, 2011 7:30 PM I PURCHASED A TACO, BEAN BURRITO, REQUESTED A ORANGE SODA, DR. [PEPPER, PIBB AND WAS TOLD THEY WERE ALL OUT. THE TACO WAS SO STALE I COULDN&apos;T EAT IT, THEIR WAS ONLY A TEASPOON OF REFRIED BEANS. THIS IS FROM THE STORE IN DAYTON, NEVADA, 89403. I HAVE ENCOUNTERED TROUBLE WITH THE HELP THERE BEFORE. PLACE NEEDS NEW AND BETTER MANAGEMENT. NO WAY DO THEY COMPARE THE COMPETIVE IN CARSON CITY, NV. THE TACO SHELL EVEN HADE A MUSTY ORDER TO IT. 



 Jessica Harley 12/29/10 
 I will NEVER eat at a taco bell ever again. Ive got food poisioning twice in under a year. Mind you from two different taco bells. The first time was at one in cabot,ar I contacted taco bell they called said it was because my shells from the chulpas were left out too long. So I was like ok thanks and used them at one taco bell in Conway,ar. And it was fine didnt get sick. A few nights ago I was staying with my bf and got hungry had him take me to a taco bell in little rock,ar and again got food poisioning. Ive emailed them three times and no call no email nothing. If I would have had to go to the er they would have a lawsuit. The first time I was sick for three days the second luckly was only one night.
Taco bell will never get my business again. 



 JB 12/28/10 
 We usually stop at the Taco Bell off of Lyons in Valencia when we travel up north. If you have to eat fast food, TB is our favorite. The place was so filthy this time, we walked out. The bathrooms smelled, had no tp except for one stall, no seat covers and the sink was stopped up with filthy water. The trashcans were disgusting and the floor had a visible layer of dirt. the parking lot had trash strewn about. I asked the manager what happened and if the management was new. He said yes and that they were short staff. We walked out. 



 Sheri Wiles 12/20/10 
 okay so taco bell is bogus. like if you go to taco bell you are an idiot. Now ill give it to them that a long time ago they were doing all right, but in the past years i have no clue what has happened. So this is the story me and my mom went to taco bell on 12-20-2010. Now my mother works at jewel so she knows how customers should be treated and my mom knows what it feels like when customers treat you like s*** and then call and complain to your manger saying that she was the one being rude. so obviously this is not the case. My mother was not being rude at all. She ordered two tacos for me with everything but no onions. So then the lady repeats it back to her like this okay so you want two tacos with just meat. My mom goes no everything no onions. So then this dumb lady goes okay two tacos with meat and cheese. So then my mom goes no. Then they lady starts to scream at the top of her lungs at my mom when she was the one who was f***** mumbling. I swear when did these people think it was okay to scream at people like that. I bet this lady wouldn&apos;t have liked it if i went inside and screamed at her. All i have to say is that taco bell is the worst fast food chain ever. I personally will never go there again and i hope that everyone will spread the word around about how taco bell needs to be shut down. O and also the food i revived after this visit was cold and had spit in it. This is illegal btw or it should be so taco bell if you see this you better watch out cuz im sure if i got all the people on this site together a lot of them have gotten sick from your food. You better watch your back because this is an outrage and America or any wear els you have your crappy establishments at will not stand for this. 



 Rachael 12/20/10 
 I visited our locate crap store here in Spring, TX. Store #019252. Why do I say crap? Because for the mere fact that it indeed is what it is. I ordered the XXL Chalupa Combo. The popular phrase comes to mind: WHERE&apos;S THE BEEF? Would anyone pay this sort of money to be a vegetarian AND on a diet going through a fast food restaurant? I mean, really? I called to talk to the manager, and she didn&apos;t give two flying flips what my problem was. I guess I knocked that chip she had on her shoulder off because to be a manager, you&apos;d think she&apos;d try to have some resolution to the problem. It&apos;s simple...CARE and train your people to actually CARE and to go over and beyond. Nope, not the case in this day and age. I asked for sour cream on my taco. I did&apos;t get it. I even asked for extra meat, because it&apos;s not even a tablespoon. I didn&apos;t get that either. No tomatoes come on the tacos, UNLESS you ask for a taco supreme....so says this joke of a manager. I WILL NOT EVER RETURN TO TACO BELL! Back in the day, it was great food. That was a past time! Taco Bell can shove it where the sun doesn&apos;t shine! 



 Ann Minkler 12/5/10 
 So, today Dec 5th, 2010, I go to Taco Bell beacause I saw an advertisement for a $2.oo special on TV. I asked for the special, the lady said it was 2.99 . I said I saw your advertisement on tv for 2.00. She said that was corporate and that they wer a franchise.So, what is the difference? It is still Taco Bell advertisements. If they aren&apos;t going to comply, they should have mentioned that in there commercial. Kinda of stinks, if you aske me. Needless to say, we left. 



 Leigh Burton 12/4/10 
 The store #003355

I have gone to this toco Bell several time never got good service but this last time was the worst. It was late and we decided to stop by since it was the close one to us at that time. We were asked to pull up and they will bring our order out to us we had to wait 15 min for our order then, once we received it the order was right for once, but they did not give us all our drinks. We advised the worker he said ok we waited five more min for him to come back with our drink he never went to the drive thru to advise the cashier she asked to see our receipt. We told her everyone received there drink except one she refused to give us our drink she said to call corporate office, but the number on the receipt is a disconnected number. I spent a lot of money for her to not give us our drink she was rude and and had no regard to for the customer. We will never go back there and I will tell everyone that I know not to also. Again we never have had a good experience at that store.The Cashier that gave us the problems name is Adrienne her number is 2967 



 Jacqueline Cadavid 12/7/10 
 I was recently at your taco bell location in Kendall, Florida. The one on 104 st and 152 avenue. It was 9:54 pm and the lobby doors were closed with the door saying close is at 10:00. I frequently go to this location and would like this fixed. Wouldn&apos;t want to make another trip to dine I the lobby and it&apos;s closed. 



 Missy Ash 12/8/10 
 I love to eat at Taco Bell and so does my family. Everytime we go there and get home we have gotten the wrong food or not had it all and even received drinks half way full. When I call them they want to give me free cinnammon twist and that is it. So, the 5th time I warned them I was calling their coperative office if I had this problem again. Well one more time which I have been patient enough. I had finally gotten enough and I called them talked to the manager and obtainned the coperative office number and called them. I am still talking to their district manager who is going to call me and if not I will be calling him. Well they lost this time because one of the people I spoke with is sending me out coupons and called the store and made them redo my order and refund my money. However, even with this I still am going to talk to their district manager because he needs to get these employees straight or get rid of them and replace them because there is a lot of people out there looking for jobs who would be happy to work. But thank you from the first district manager I spoke with who understood me being upset did what she had to do and is still trying to contact the main person I need to speak with she was very nice and respectful. 



 David 12/8/10 
 The XXL Chalupa you get is the one they advertise. My first was in Coral Springs, Florida and it was short on ingredients, but the drive back was too long - not worth it.

The second was in Store #016827, 2466 N STATE ROAD 7 in MARGATE, FL and it was ordered inside, as I expected the same treatment - yup it was short-weighted. I pushed my complaint until the manager (Otto) told the preparer to beef it up. It must be company-wide. 

 

 12/11/10 
 Oh goodness. Ordered a 5 layer burrito and. Medium sprite. We waited 30 min. If it had not been for my grandson I would not have waited. Very poor service! 



 Mike White 12/14/10 
 In my way home from work , around 1:30 AM, I stopped at the Taco Bell in Steubenville, OH. I used my debit card to pay for my meal. The next day I went to get gas, and I couldn&apos;t find my debit card anywhere. I then remembered that I had used it the night before. So I called the Taco Bell I had stopped at, and they said that it was in their safe. I got it back and everything seemed OK. A few days later I was trying to use my debit card again, but it was declined. I went to my bank and they told me that my card had been deactivated due to suspicious activity. It turns out someone was using my card info to download stuff for their xbox. Now my card had to be cancelled and I have to get a new one. I&apos;m pretty pissed off about this. It has to be one of the taco bell employees that did this. I am currently attempting to investigate this and intend to call the Taco Bell corporate office. I 



 Casey Strain 12/1/10 
 I read on the official website that Taco Bell was hiring crew members at all 3 of their restaurants here in Janesville, Wisconsin. I applied online and a few days later decided to call the restaurants to check on my application. The one near Highway 51 said they weren&apos;t hiring at all when the website clearly said they were. The on on Milton Ave said they would call me in a few days and never did. The manager of the one on court street took my cell number and my information down and said they would call me in a few days. This was early november. I called every other day for awhile and they kept telling me they would review my app and call me. I called a week later and they said the same thing. Waited another week and got the same reply. Waited 2 weeks as the previous week was thanksgiving and called yesterday and was told the same thing.
It has now been over 30 days and I must re-apply at Taco Bell for a job.

This is entirely unprofessional behavior. 



 Aaron F. Baker 11/28/10 
 We Visited The Taco Bell In Guymon Oklahoma On The 28th Of November And Placed Our Order At 7:10P.M.,My Wife Was Taking Me To Lunch From Work I Work 12 Hour Shift,I Had To Go Back To Work Without A Lunch Ate.My Wife,and Myself Ordered Qty=2 Taco Pizza Combo Meals With Drink,and Two Taco&apos;s,After Waiting Until 19:40,and Our Order Was Not Ready Yet,We Had To Ask For A Refund,and Go Back To Work Hungry,During This Time We Noticed Several Other Customers Waiting Like Six Others,One Family With Three Kids Where Waiting For 30 Minutes,and Where Told It Would Take Another 30 Minutes,This Is Crazy,They Should Of At Least Told You Up Front That They We&apos;re Short Handed,Instead Of Making Us Wait Like That How Rude!I Thought Besides The Refund They Should Give Us free Meals,But No They Could Not Do That. 



 James Scott 11/21/10 
 I went to store 004904 Pasadena, Maryland. The cashier was named Alita and the other young lady was Alissa. I wanted to say that these two women gave me the best service and as always when I go in that store everyone on that staff gives their 100%. I spoke to a manager named Sharon and told her how I felt and she too was top notch.
The problem I have is with your survey. I tried to give it to the survey but because I recently gave another 5 star survey on Britnanny that works at the same store I was not allowed even to get past the form. Believe it or not but not everybody is trying to win a thousand dollars or cares about it that much but I do care about great service and I wanted you to know that the entire store of 004904 deserves to be recognized for their good work. 



 Tony 11/21/10 
 Really 0 star&apos;s, I have been to several location&apos;s threw out salt lake city and there food and customer service has hgotten worse threw the year&apos;s. NEVER in the last 30 visit&apos;s has my order been correct so I call and they tell me to come back and they will fix it. I DONT want to come back, get the damn order right the first time and tonight i went in to get my food and two people did not even know how to make a plain regular old taco, I watched them unwrap my taco&apos;s twice cause they forgot to put something on them, I want to call corperate but what good would it do. There still going to bring in there money and if there is honestly this many complaint&apos;s they must not care to much. so needless to say my kid is going to suffer cause he loves taco bell and I refuse to eat there ever again, and I hope enough people do the same and they go under and disappear. 



 Tony Smith 11/24/10 
 Someone needs to file a false advertising claim on Taco Hell for the pics of their food looking nothing at all like the food they give you! I thought the XXL chaplupa looked really good in the picture, full of meat, a little letuce etc. Needless to say the chalupa I received had very little meat and was packed full of letuce! FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!! Never again will I cross your door! 



 shane 11/24/10 
 I like the food. The service is by far the worst, along with kfc. Does mcdonalds or wendys run out of fries? No. With that said, my real complaint is more of a conspiracy theory. This $1,000 weekly survey contest is probably a scam. Nobody actually wins. And I checked the so called &quot;winners list&quot;, and nobody has ever won from Mass. Really? Since 2004 your telling me that not one person has won from Mass? Ok, rite. So I guess I should move then huh? I&apos;m calling BULLSHIT

 I&apos;ve been eating at the same taco bell location in CT since they opened it&apos;s very close to my house so I chose it because it was quick and close in the recent years the service started getting worse and worse along with my orders being wrong I had long wait times and a few occasions where they told me they had run out of beef! I just recently went in which I ordered 4 soft tacos with no lettuce the drivethrough person repeated the order back correctly and I drove up I got the food and drove home upon opening my first taco I noticed the lettuce immeaditly they had put it on all my tacos I began to pick the lettuce when I noticed a 4 inch hair mixed in the beef not only was I extremely angry I was almost sick I have never been more disgusted in my life the workers at this place are some of the dumbest people I&apos;ve ever seen how hard is your job it revolves around making food and they can&apos;t even make it right! They have a nasty kitchen ignorant workers and I will never visit this place again.

 I ordered a Deal #1 and an order of cheesy fiesta potatoes. The chicken burrito was stale tasting and so were the fiesta potatoes. Also the fruit punch was too syrupy and then exchanged for a sierra mist and it was too carbonated. The only thing good about my whole visit were the cinnamon twists... which were warmer than both the chicken burrito and the potatoes after i already finished those. I&apos;m very upset and i&apos;m calling corporate first thing tomorrow. 



 Lewis Thomas 11/17/10 
 I used to work at a local Taco Bell where i lived in Berea, Ky. I later was promoted to shift manager after only being there for 8 months. I enjoyed working there. A new GM arrived there a the restaraunt went downhill from there. I eventually had to put a two week notice in that i was leaving. So, after i had finally left Taco Bell, i later found out that The New GM had put me down as a non-rehire and i was very upset. His name is Josh Roberts. He later quit Taco Bell. So, i recently tried to re-apply at Taco Bell and was unable to get my old job back. Is the anything i can do to get this over turned or can someone help me out?

 So I walk into the Taco Bell in Palatine IL 60067. and am in a great mood and ask the cashier how are you? To my amazement with unemployment so high she replies I&apos;m tired and I do not want to be here.So I order a burrito supreme with extra lettuce then she makes the statement why extra lettuce we put enough on already, I reply because thats the way I would like it. she reminds me that it will be an additional .30cents I say thats fine. I pay and go sit down at a dirty table because not one is clean so I clean mine off and low and behold my burrito has NO LETTUCE so I ask for Manager and she just replies sorry.By now I am not even hungry so just out of curiousity I ask Manager what is the normal required lettuce weight for a burrito supreme and she says 15.5 ounces I&apos;m astounded at her answer and decide to leave but while doing so I address the cashier and let her know I give her full permission to go home for the evening and not to bother coming in for the next 3 days.

 Brooke 11/15/10 
 Port Orchard Wa Taco Bell, ALL OF THEM SHOULD BE FIRED! Everytime I go in there they are completely horrible. They mouth off to their customers, slam drive-thru windows in faces, and never get the right orders. They refuse to give receipts so they can say they didn&apos;t get their order&apos;s wrong. I am seriously considering calling The Union on this restaurant. I refuse to eat there and so do many people I know in Port Orchard. 



 Dean Goodman 11/11/10 
 If they had 0 stars i&apos;d put that for the store in Quakertown, PA. The new manager there, John P is so obnoxious it&apos;s unbelievable! He barely knows what to do himself. He is supposed to be coaching not degrading and calling people names, other workers and customers which is what happened to me. Had a wrong order, and John P called me a &quot;jerk&quot; while i was walking away. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK BECAUSE OF THIS JOHN. NO thanks. 



 TACO BELL MANAGER 11/8/10 
 I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE SO MONEY HUNGRY THAT THATS WHY THEY DIE OVER A DAM BURITTO OR A TACO I THINK IF YOU DON&apos;T LIKE WAITING IN A LINE OR A MMISTAKE ON YOUR FOOD THEN YOU NEED TO GO HOME AND COOK FOR YOUR SELF........THERE IS NO NEED TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE CRAP JUST BECAUSE YOUR GOING THROUGH PROBLEMS.I THINK THAT PEOPLE TREAT WORKERS LIKE WE ARE PERFECT AND MAKE NO MISTAKE I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO REALLY WAKE UP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS BECAUSE THEY ACT LIKE MY 2 YEAR BABY GIRL.....GORW AND LEARN TO COOK FOR YOUR SELF THAN YOU HAVE A NICE DAY 



 TACO BELL MANAGER 11/8/10 
 RUDE EMPLOYEES, DIRTY DINING ROOMS, UNSANITARY RESTROOMS AND IGNORANT EMPLOYEES ARE ONE THING: RUDE CUSTOMERS ARE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ENTIRELY.
TRY WORKING IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!! IT&apos;S NOT THAT EASY. ANY FOOL KNOWS THAT THE FOOD ISN&apos;T GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE PICTURES.(WHY DON&apos;T YOU EAT THE PLASTIC!!!) THE STORE EMPLOYEES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THE PICTURES LOOK LIKE. IN ADDITION, IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY WERE GIVEN A TEASPOON OF MEAT........I DOUBT THAT!! I&apos;M SURE YOU GOT AT LEAST A TABLESPOON. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD SUGGEST SKIMPING ON FOOD IS THE WAY TACO BELL INCREASES THEIR PROFIT MARGIN.........GET REAL!!!!! DO YOU KNOW THE PROFIT ON A $1.59 LARGE DRINK??? IT&apos;S SOMETHING LIKE..$1.49!!!!!!!! TACO BELL&apos;S PROFITS ARE BUILT IN. THERE IS A STANDARD PORTION FOR EACH PRODUCT. FOR A TACO IT&apos;S AN OUNCE AND A HALF.
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU HAVE TO PULL OFF FROM THE DRIVE-THRU WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR FOOD?? IF IT&apos;S MORE THAN ONCE THEN WHO&apos;S THE FOOL????
I DEAL WITH TROUBLESOME CUSTOMERS EVERY SINGLE DAY.(MULTIPLE TIMES!!) FOR THE PERSON WHO WOULD SUGGEST THAT &quot;THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT&quot; I WOULD SUGGEST THAT,&quot;NO, THE CUSTOMER IS USUALLY WRONG OR IRRATIONAL BUT IT IS MY JOB TO SATISFY THAT FOOL NO MATTER HOW STUPID OR IRRITATING THEY ARE.&quot;
IT&apos;S NOT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU BUT INSTEAD, IT&apos;S HOW YOU HANDLE IT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT THEN STATE IT CALMLY TO THE MANAGER IN CHARGE AND SUGGEST A SOLUTION THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SATISFIED. FOR EXAMPLE: &quot;EXCUSE ME, THIS MILK IS SOUR. MAY I PLEASE HAVE A PEPSI INSTEAD?&quot; OR &quot;THIS MILK IS SOUR. MAY I HAVE MY MONEY BACK?&quot;
THE PROBLEM IS NOT ALWAYS THE SERVICE. IT IS SOMETIMES THE WAY THE PROBLEM IS PRESENTED TO THE MANAGEMENT. I HAVE HEARD SOME INCREDIBLE THINGS.
AS TO THE PERSON THAT THINKS TACO BELL IS ACTING LIKE THEY WANT TO STEAL THE FOOD..............I HANDLE COMPLAINTS, OFTEN FROM OTHER FAST FOOD WORKERS, WHO ARE TRYING TO GET SOME FREE FOOD. SOMETIMES IT&apos;S HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES....................IT&apos;LL FEEL LIKE A MARATHON WHEN YOU ARE THROUGH. WHEN YOU SERVE 20,OOO PEOPLE PER WEEK YOU ARE BOUND TO MAKE A MISTAKE OR TWO. TACO BELL ALLOWS 1.4 COMPLAINTS PER 10,000 TRANSACTIONS!!!!!! THAT&apos;S LESS THAN 2 COMPLAINTS PER 10,000 CUSTOMERS!!!!! THAT IS DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.
SO...........IF YOU WANT TO CAUSE A PROBLEM...CALL THE 1-800 NUMBER!!!!!!!!

TACO BELL IS AS UNFAIR TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AS THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE TO YOU!!!!!!!!!!
WITH THAT SAID,&quot;THANK YOU, AND HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!!&quot; 



 Michael Clay 11/2/10 
 My first job was at a Taco Bell in Stanton Ca., 1972. Had the gas fire pits back then. Best food I ever tasted and it is still my favorite. Normally I would give you five stars but I have to subtract one today due to the following complaint:

I have asked several Taco Bell managers to make me a Bell Beefer. They all say that they no longer make that item! I am very upset you never brought back the Bell Beefer. You have repeatedly denied me one of life&apos;s most profound joys! I salivate at the thought of one. If I could just taste one once again my life would be fulfilled!

I would ask that you consider adding it as a promo item - but then I realize I am but one lone voice crying in the wind.

Bell Beefer Blues,
Mike

 Taco Bell Hurricane WV&amp;TeaysValley WV

These two restaraunts have to be the worst two of any in the whole chain. They are always understaffed and never clean. You have to clean your own table when you choose to eat in. When you go through the drive thru you have to pull over and double check your bag to make sure your order is correct. If you ever forget to check your order and do go home they offer to replace what they left out of your order like they are giving it to you free. The point is I already PAID for it but never received it so it isn&apos;t giving me something free but giving me what I paid for at a later time. That&apos;s terrible business practice. I hope that TACO BELL Corporate looks at these ratings and reports from time to time because I say to you corporate TACO BELL your quality of your product is POOR at best. It&apos;s a good thing your food is cheap other wise you would have went out of business years ago. Why is it so hard to contact Corporate Office of TACO BELL. They obviously know how bad they are treating their customers or they would be easier contacted. How about giving something back to the customers that have made you the millions you have in the bank. How about putting some customer service and quality back into your chain of stores that plague North America nation wide!!!!!!! 



 ginger klekar 11/5/10 
 I used to really enjoy Taco Bell but their advertisement on the Chalupa is false. The one I had, had hardly any meat, yet they show it stuffed with me and advertise more than you can eat. Also their extra cheesy/meat burrito was primarily stuffed with rice. I never even order anything with rice. Again this is supposed to have more beef in it and again it was false advertisement. I hope they will take a good look at how they advertise instead of misleading people.

 Barbara Pennington 11/3/10 
 Hi my name is Barbara Pennington and I am an old employee worked at Taco Bell in 2008. The reason for this letter of complaint is because I last work for Taco Bell in 2008 and I knew that I had 1 more check to pick up and the managers kept telling me that they didnt have one for me then when I saw one of the managers that no longer worked there cause at the time she previously quit told me that they had a check for me in the safe. Well I called that particular store and they still told me again that there was no check but I knew that was a lie because I know how to count my hours and I knew they didnt give me all my money I worked for.So of course I left it alone and didnt question it anymore I felt if they did have a check for me eventually Taco Bell will send it to my home address,well what did I know this year 2010 almost 2 years later I recieved a letter stating that Taco Bell had a check holding for me that was probably from my last worked hours.August 19,2010 I faxed the letter along with all my information they had requested verifying that it was me and I also mailed the letter in just to be sure they recieved it,I called the number that was on the letter they sent me several times to verify that they had recieved the letter but no oe has returned my call.I really feel that this is rediculous and that I really want and need my money because I worked for that money.Please let me know what I need to do other then call a number that no one is responding to my calls. Thank you,Barbara Drake Pennington 



 Gerardo Rodriguez 10/28/10 
 Your TacoBell in 1190 Calimesa, Blvd, Calimesa, CA. 92320, franchise owned by James Dupuy.....I think they don&apos;t take any criteria to select their employees, per example: The actual manager &quot;Jason&quot;, this guy doesn&apos;t have the minimum idea about customer service, and is very clear that &quot;Jason&quot; don&apos;t know the magical phrase &quot;The Customer is Always Right&quot;.... This guy is very RUDE with customers, he look like a &quot;Home Less&quot;, never uses the head net or the cap that is supposed to every employee has to wear, do u think that is good business for the owner if all &quot;Jason&quot; friends and family eat &quot;free&quot; ??? Yes &quot;free&quot;... This guy is the worst kind of employees that a business can have.....and of
course he&apos;s not the only one doing this. It&apos;s a shame that when a customer want to place an order the cashier&apos;s are always outside smoking, and the customer have to wait more than 5 minutes some times place his order.....

 Your food is amazing and your stores here in the chicago land area are awesome the only i have to say is get rid of those cantina tacos the after taste of those things are disgusting and your people dont know how not to put onions on them when you ask for no onions other than that the food rules. 



 Beverlyn Smith 10/26/10 
 I went to the Taco Bell 4903 Fenton Rd. Flint, Michigan. I purchased the new XXL chalupa. I was teased by the commercial. There was less than a tea spoon of meat, but it was filled with lettuce and tomato&apos;s. Needless to say I was very disappointed. 



 Robert Cody 10/24/10 
 Your store in Osage Beach Mo. Should be closed the ppl there don&apos;t know what the hell they are doing I won&apos;t go back nor will I recamend it to any one 



 Brooke 10/22/10 
 My local Taco Bell likes to close the restaurant area about 20min early. You would think after the second time I wouldn&apos;t return...guess the third time is a charm. Once again the doors were lock 20min early. The reason we wanted to go in is bc we had 3 separate orders. After being told we can&apos;t have separate orders, I will not return. We received our order and it was wrong! If these people hate their job so much maybe they should look for another. This is ridiculous. I&apos;m actually in the drive thru now and the store number is 026023 . By the way those people are so rude!! 



 Meredith 10/21/10 
 While traveling to the mountains of North Carolina we passed through Lenoir. The Taco Bell there was the most immaculate I have ever been in with a sanitation grade A. The staff all were extremely helpful and the food good. Great job! 



 tasha taylor 10/18/10 
 Well i would never go back there because they have no good communication skills and are very disrepectful. I went to the one in saint louis mo, in OLIVE, an a young lady by the name of Brittay was so mean an gave me cold food, when i told her that my food was not made right. they yelled at,an i was told too go eles whear an eat, they dont need my money.
 



 Quad Cities IA&amp;IL - Tired of poor sanitation practices&amp;filthy taco bel 10/14/10 
 RE: Taco Bell in Rock Island, Illinois

I visited this location with a relative and our teenage daughters. The orders were quite simple, however; it was taking a rather long time for the young female cashier named, &quot;Ana&quot;, to find a button on the register for a &quot;bean burrito with cheese&quot;. She scanned up and down the keys on the register several times. (I assume that she was new so we had no problem being patient with her, we were not in a hurry and we were the only customers there.) After looking over the register several times, she stepped back and &quot;coughed&quot; into her right hand (as if to buy her some time), then stepped back to the register and scanned some more. Instead of asking a fellow co-worker or her boss (who was within arms length behind her), she took a step back &quot;again&quot;, coughing into her left hand....contaminating &quot;both&quot; hands. So I simply leaned forward and told her nicely that it was a &quot;bean&amp;cheese burrito&quot;. (apparently my daughter&apos;s &quot;wording&quot; threw her off.) You could see the light bulb come on above her...lol. (sweet gal)...&quot;anyway&quot;...so after she finished taking the rest of our orders, I leaned towards her and asked her nicely if she could please wash her hands before handling our food. (simple request, &quot;everyone&quot; wants to eat un-contaminated food.) I assume that she didn&apos;t even realize that she had just coughed into both hands because as I was getting my drink, I over heard her telling her female boss (short, stout, older woman with brown hair and thick glasses), that I asked her to wash her hands. I was shocked to hear the boss say,(almost yelling), &quot;WELL WHO THE HELL DOES SHE THINK &quot;SHE&quot; IS??&quot;....I looked over at her to let her know that, &quot;yes&quot;, I heard her. We have tried in several ways to report this to corporate, but we have had no response yet. This happened a few months ago and I have sent off four letters now. (one per month). For years the taco bells around here have been slowly going &quot;down hill&quot;. I am having a hard time finding good customer service, young kids jacking around instead of being professional&amp;poor sanitation practices at all of the taco bells here in the Quad Cities and I am having just as hard of a time finding &quot;clean&quot; taco bells. The lobby floors, tables, seats&amp;bathrooms are always disgusting....no matter which location we visit. (on both the IA&amp;IL side of the river.) yuck! 



 Gary O 10/14/10 
 You know, I don&apos;t like doing this, making complaints like this. But more and more restaurants are not training or managing their staff well.

I go occasionally to the KFC/Taco Bell located in Woburn, Mass. I went there yesterday on 10-13-10 and purchased a large Cole Slaw and one of the &quot;New&quot; XXL Chalupas. I drove home hoping to have a good meal. When I opened the box the food came in, boy was I disappointed.

The NEW XXL (I assumed it meant extra-extra large)Chalupa was the size of a Soft Taco inside the outer shell. I thought like the ads seem to indicate, this was an extra packed item.

While I am here, other times I have gone to this particular store and found bones numerous times in the b-b-q chicken sandwiches.

Why doesn&apos;t a store Manager check that things are done, and people served correctly. This does not make for good business. I only hope someone in Corporate takes real notice of this. I used to think good about TB, now I am not sure I want to waste my money on things advertised as larger, more- only to find it untrue. 



 Extremely unsatisfied customer, farmington hills, MI 10/9/10 
 Me and my wife decided to sit down and relax for a bit while eating lunch at the Taco Bell on Orchard Lake rd just north west of 13 Mile rd in Farmington hills MI. My wife ordered her meal minus a few things, ( sour cream tomatoes etc..) and I placed my order. ( There was no line at all) The girl at the cash register had no idea how to take our order ( as 5 other employees were standing right behind her). They couldn&apos;t take a hundred dollar bill, so I just paid with a credit card to make things easier on her. After receiving our order (18 minutes later), we sat down and tried to start eating only to find hair in our food. We asked to speak to a manager about the situation with absolutely no luck there. The whole crew behind the counter started complaining about us standing there and we could hear them talking to eachother over their headset intercoms. As a business owner, I know how to treat your customers to get them to come back and refer their friends. I also know how to ruin a reputation, which I will be doing for this Taco Bell as long as I&apos;m in business in Farmington hills. The customer service was rediculous and the cleanliness was awful at best, not to mention a health risk. Corporate needs to step in and point some of these resteraunts in the right direction. 



 Douglas of Rocky River Ohio 10/1/10 
 Have been buying the all beef goridta supreme from taco bell since they were introduced. On Septembe 30,2010 I purchased my last all beef beef gordita supreme from taco bel,. Taco bell like the other big companies are giving you less for the same price. An example is that the Puffs manufacturer gives you less shheets of Puffs each year and makes the sheets thinner.
Well Taco Bell now packs my Gorita with lettece and some kind od strange meat but not the hamburger they used to use.Hardly any sour cream-no cheese and 3 o4 diced tomatos. No more for me- I will boycott this company.

Taco bell is indicative of a profit monger that has cheapened their product to make more money. Want proof -just look at their board of Directors. Most of them are well experiened at &quot;cheating &quot; the public to make more money. 



 Jori Bellingar 9/30/10 
 Taco Bell at Lake Mead and Civic Center in North Las Vegas Nevada, Is the most terrible place I have ever eaten at, They don&apos;t put any ingredients in the food, What happened to the days when 30 dollars could get a meal for 5 people, now they are discustinly gross, Ane my wors of mouth is going to stop any body I tell not to eat there, cause I am pissed. piss on Taco Bell and Kentucky refried chicken. 



 r. knopf 9/27/10 
 i have been to store #1986 several times and it seems the same problems are there year after year. wrong order.the reason i know the store # is because i.m still having the same problems at the levittown.pa store. i.m not driving 10 miles round trip to take back the wrong order.when will corp. take action? maybe they should go on the show &quot;under cover boss&quot; and show us they do care.until then, i&quot;m not going back. 



 Christine calder 9/25/10 
 Prosser wa, literally is gross I found completely burnt rice in my burrito. This is stupid. I&apos;m heated and I am never going there again!!! Doesn&apos;t even deserve a star..... 



 Tina Goforth 9/23/10 
 I saw the advertisement for the new chicken&amp;cheese flatbread sandwich.. looked very filling.. went thru the drive-thru got me 2.. got home, and I am opened up my sandwich to find the amount of chicken&amp;cheese was the size of a 1/2 dollar.. I have taken a picture and I will be sharing this with all the world to see on facebook.. the product you presented and the product you offer is two completely different items.. You talk about faulse advertisement... poor excuse for a company.. DO NOT BUY THE CHICKEN&amp;CHEESE SANDWICH YOU WILL BE VERY SAD AND VERY HUNGRY... oh did I mention that the chicken that was in the sandwich was the size of a dime.. and there was only 3 pieces... 



 Chrissy Strawser 4/16/10 
 Taco Bell location on E Broad Street in Whitehall, Ohio
Day 1-13-10 - took my son to Taco Bell. Well actually he had subway and I wanted taco bell, so I&apos;m waiting in line -and I&apos;m the 3rd person back, and I hear them telling the first customer, we are out of those shells, can we make that a gorditta? Then they say oh, I&apos;m sorry, we are out of those to. They already took her money, and then decide to tell her they are out of everything that she tries to order. So the lady is standing there like what do I do. So she settles for some taco&apos;s and they move on to the next couple. Oh we are out of those shell, oh we don&apos;t have any steak, we don&apos;t have that either. Okay - so they order some tacos and some chips, they paid $22.00 and didn&apos;t even get what they wanted to orderr. So it&apos;s my turn, I&apos;ve been standng in line 10 minutes now at a &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant. So I order a pizza meal. You know with bread sticks and a soda. So guess what - no bread stick. So I say how about you exchange the bread sticks for 2 soft taco&apos;s (about the same price). Well all the sudden there is breadsticks but I&apos;ll have to wait another 7 minutes. Now I was so upset and pissed off to say the least. I said are you f***ing kidding. I just couldn&apos;t believe it. 17 minutes to get a little personal pan pizza and some breadstick. Well needless to say I walked out! This is by far the worst Taco Bell that I have ever been in.


 



 Robert Siegel 4/20/10 
 While I believe Taco Bell has superior quality fast food, I have become terribly disallusioned for the following reasons.

Several months ago I reported, via your website, a situation that I deemed misleading, if not fraudulant. Intrigued by your TV advertising of your &quot;Cheesey 5 Layer Beef Burrito&quot; for only 89 cents&quot;, I ordered 2, in addition to other items, and was charged 99 cents. When I mentioned it to the store staff, the manager told me &quot;Oh, that&apos;s coroprate. We&apos;re a franchise.&quot; To date I have not heard a word - not even an acknowledgement of my complaint. The same has happened at several other stores. Can the stores decide pricing? Can I shop stores to get a better price? I have never had a similar experience at any other fast food restaurant.

As of today, your are still running the TV ad for 89 cents, and your stores are still chargeing 99 cents. Ten cents is really not much, but multiply it by the vast number of Taco Bell customers and you have quite a windfall. I&apos;m curious as to what your explanation (if any) would be. 

 

 Pamela Rose 4/29/10 
 Grrrrrrrr ~ ~ your commercial for &quot;Late Night... even until 3:00am...&quot; finally has me writing this. As the voice advertises the great food available, the TV is showing car loads of older teens partying and showing up for late-night tacos, etc. Fine fine but front and center is what, an 8-year old (?) break dancing with crowds gathering around? Is he someone in the group&apos;s child, or a neighborhood delinquent just hanging out at Taco Bell - - THAT LATE AT NIGHT??? What&apos;s up with this - I find this commercial very inappropriate and as a Mom become angered, changing the channel when it comes on. Ok, well, thank you for this opportunity to sound off ~ I hope someone over there in Irvine, CA reads these. Thank you!

 taco bell on keith bridge road in cumming georgia putting no steak in steak taco salads. making every burrito whatever kind it is the same with a very small amount of ingredients, which is mostly lettuce and sour cream.

 I am 63 years old and have been a fan of Taco Bell for sooo many years. For the laast 3 years I have become more and more disallusioned. How about a lawsuit charging false advertising????? How about hiring someone whose first language is English. Today was the last straw.I ordered a cheesy double beef burrito. How can you possibly call it double beef when you put less than a tablespoon of beef on it. After complaining about it to the Manager they made me another one, this time with LESS beef. What is the matter with you people? Or is this another case of Corporate greed? This store is located on north main street in Longmont Colorado #001998. My $100 a month Taco Bell habit will now be spent at Del Taco thank you. 



 Susan Huff 5/14/10 
 I went to taco bell and they got my order wrong twice, and not to metion i waited in line 20 minutes for them to mess up my order. They were rude so i got rude and told them this was not a difficult job. They then refused to serve me any food. They shut the window in my face and then laughed about it. That was the manager too. Well that will be the last time they ever get my money. The richmond indiana taco bell needs better managment. They dont deserve jobs. 



 Carmen Beardsley 5/19/10 
 Not pleased with the way my family was treated at taco bell in tampa on waters. ave. To make a long story short. My almost 21.00 dollar order was messed up my meals were all supreme and i payed for them it also had supreme on the reciept. but we didn&apos;t get it on any but one taco that was seperate from the combos. when i called the store and spoke with manager marlane she said if u want come back and i will give u cinnamon twist for the problem i said no i already paid for supeme items then she said well i will take ur name down and when u come back i will give u 5 supreme tacos. i had my recipt and she was able to look it up. i said fine. when i went to collect we stood in the store over 20 min. she couldn&apos;t remember ME. i WENT 3 days later. she said my name would be down on paper. It took another manager to correct the problem. today i called customer service explained all the drama and they said sorry. wow i think they should have offered ,me a full refund when they couldn&apos;t make right on there word. i didn&apos;t ask i wanted to see now how customer was gonna handle this. other than a bag of free cinnamon twist. sorry i just cant believe it they like it when i spend my money there. but cant make good on there end. thats fine i will still go but i will take all the time i need in drive thru to check every order. cause if u have a issue they dont like that.

 My husband went through the Drive Thru to get our family&apos;s meal....when he came home needless to find that in all our meals there was hardly any meat, only enough to cover a string line on the inside of the shell. We ordered the 3 Chaluba Naco Cheese, 1 taco, and 2 Naco Bell Grande.... and all of them had more chips and shells and some veg, and baby portion meat!!!!! Needless to say, we won&apos;t be going to this Taco Bell again. It was like eating cardboard!!!! When we called, they said sorry, but that is just the way it is!!!!!! Very sad!

 No everyone that goes to taco bell at 1 am is drunk. I stopped at the bell in strongsville ohio on my way home from work and ordered 2 tacos supreams with mild sauce. I live 1 mile from this location. When I got home the tacos were cold and were not wraped well and when I opened the bag the tacos were all over the bottom of the bag. Need I mention there was hot sauce not mild. I work hard for my money and will never go back there.

We ate at Taco Bell in East Peoria Il. This will be the last time
I ever eat there! First the employees and management (Michele) need to take in account that people actually eat the food and take care in how it is prepared!
The taco was so disgusting/basically there was maybe a tablespoon
of filling inside and shell was so stale that I asked for a refund.
The chicken on the salad was minimal to say the least!
Clearly Taco Bell has some improving to do! 



 Kash 9/9/10 
 I can&apos;t believe they can&apos;t train their employee&apos;s, ordered a bean crunch wrap and got beef, no beans, on top of that they charged me .70cents extra for the beans, went to get refund, manager said she doesn&apos;t know anything about the refund. Don&apos;t know how these people do business. 



 Victim of Taco Bell 9/14/10 
 I have been victimized by the local Taco Bell just yesterday on sept 13 2010.

Last thursday the local Tacohell shorted our order 3 items. Yes 3. It was a big order. We tried to call their number to report it and it kept going to the fax machine. We live 10 miles away and weren&apos;t going to drive back that night. Of course we all got shorted food that night.

Anyways yesterday we did a drive thru purchase and ordered their box deal. Of course they forgot the sauce after we had left we remembered. &quot;Oh yeah, they ripped us off last time&quot; So we drove back through and asked to see the manager, it turned out to be the assistant GM. Ok great we can take care of it now.
When we notified her of the problem, she only offered to replace the missing items and demanded the receipt. We told her it was at home and would bring it back next time and take care of it then but we wanted the whole order replaced as we fealt very wronged and &quot;ripped off&quot; well this went bad very fast... she got indignant and extremely argumentative and after going round and round and her refusing to do anything we realized our order was cold and we were SO put off so we asked for a refund.

She told us to give her the food and when we did put it on the shelf. She closed the drive thru window on us and let it fall to the ground. As we waited for our refund for about 7-10 minutes the local POLICE comes rolling up and she comes out pointing at us.

Well he calls us over and asks us what was going on, we explain what happened and how they shorted our order and now refused to give a Refund and all he says its a civil matter and they have the right to trespass or refuse service to anyone &quot;for any reason&quot;.

So the police officer told us he agreed what they did was wrong and to call the corporate office, but it was not criminal , only civil and what we did wasn&apos;t wrong either but they have the right to do business that way.

Btw , they even picked up the receipt and food and took it back in as the police was watching.

So they have the right to STEAL your money and keep your food or NOT GIVE YOU what you pay for and if and if you don&apos;t like it, they&apos;ll call the &quot;COPS&quot; on you and have you &quot;trespassed&quot;.

This was an assistant GM! So its obviously the new TACOBELL policy.

Welcome to corporate Hell where the crooks tell the cops what to do!

On this site it shows how if you try to Steal food from the CORPORATES they have you arrested but if they do it to you, then its a civil matter?? WTF???

I am leaving out the location and names as I have been waiting for the local district manager to call me back, but I think shes blowing us off...

Names and location of the &quot;TACOSTEAL&quot; WILL BE POSTED SOON!! 



 Toni 9/15/10 
 On Sept 5,2010 I visited a Taco Bell in Lake Geneva Wisconsin I placed an order fot 8 tacos that totaled $10.06. When we got to the drive thru window i noticed a sign for a special going on 12 tacos for $10.00 I asked the cashier if I could pay the difference and get the 12 tacos on the special for the $10.00 she went and the the manager who came to the window and wanted to know what the question was. Again I asked the same question and then he got and attitude about the sign and stated it wasn&apos;t worth the hassel and was going to take the sign down. I told him I didn&apos;t think thi was a hassel I just wanted to take advantage of the offer posted in the window, since you don&apos;t see it till you pull up. He did let me pay the difference,but when he handed me the order it was put in a taco bell box that wasn&apos;t put together all the way and the bottom was falling out. his attitude was i don&apos;t care. On Sunday Sept 7th i went past this same store and he did take down all the signs that were posted for specials going on. This is now way to treat people or the attitude to take in todays times. I WILL NEVER VISIT TACO BELL AGAIN 



 Digusted Customer 9/17/10 
 I went to a taco bell on the 3rd of September for my lunch break, came back to work to eat it, After eating half the taco a screw almost a inch long falls out half of what was left with the meat!!! HOW DISGUSTING!!! Went the other day to the so called &quot;manager&quot; to tell them and he gets the attitude with me, like its my fault they are unsanitary! Soooooooo Disgusted, Never again will I eat at Taco Bell, and I will let everyone know that they need to check for metal screws in their tacos!!! 



 Glenda Trawick 9/19/10 
 I want to complain about your survey contest. Your rules say entry is from Sunday-Friday. Yet no matter when you enter it says you did not qualify or win for that week whether its on a Sunday or a Thursday. I entered today Sunday the 19th at 2:48 and it gave me that message whats the deal. You want peoples business but you let them enter only once every 6 weeks. Maybe that&apos;s all people should eat there.

 Dear Corporate Office

Mr Glen Bell

I ordered my number three Taco Surpreme w/o cheese combo meal today and I didn&apos;t mind the 20 min. wait but what I did mind was when I ask the person who prepared my meal to please prepare my taco like the ones in the picture are prepared because there is only a very small amount of meat and filling, Jessica the Assis. Mgr. said &quot;Oh really!!&quot; I sait to the lady I came in with &quot;did you hear what she just said to me?&quot; My friend said that was so rude! After my meal was served to me I opened it at the counter to see how it was prepared before sitting down and sure enought, hardly anything was in the taco. Jessica came to the counter and ask what my problem was and I said &quot;why didn&apos;t you fill the tacos like they are in the pictures posted in your store?&quot; Jessica said &quot;those picture are not a real likeness of our tacos&quot; so I said &quot;then why don&apos;t you make the pictures look like my taco instead?&quot; Jessica said &quot;she would not do that&quot; and I said &quot;Is that your answer and Jessica said &quot;yes&quot;!! I am not looking for anything free but what I am looking for is good service, good food and employees who are not rude and don&apos;t work like snails!! The address I want to is 1109 Bishop, Rolla, Mo 65401
BTY, Tony the cashier was GREAT!! 



 Lissa Calder 9/9/10 
 Several days ago, my mother went to a local Taco Bell in the Portland-Metro area. While there, my mom began to choke on something stuck in her throat. Her airway was obstructed. I am a high school teacher, so I have had first aid. I have told my mother about how to rescue someone when choking. She knew at the time that she couldn&apos;t breathe, so she needed assistance. She tried to get someone to help her, but no one would. Even the people behind the counter did nothing -- which is what truly upset me.

If I have to learn the Heimlich Maneuver, I expect that someone who works in a restaurant will be trained in this very simple procedure, so he or she can assist someone who could die and is, rightfully so, in a panic. I am infuriated -- to say the least.

The only thing that makes this story any better is that my mother was able to, on her own, expel the obstruction, throwing up in the restaurant. After throwing up, she said, &quot;Doesn&apos;t anyone here know the Heimlich Maneuver?&quot; No answer from the people behind the counter. She was truly shaken in human nature and still is. Please Taco Bell: of all the trainings you offer your people, do you offer the Heimlich? If underage Boy Scouts can give it and save lives, I know that the adults behind your counter can administer it. At least, they should call 911 in the hopes that the person can be brought back to life my emergency workers.

 I wish corp would see where the employees park at resturants in Dallas Tx. They park right in front where the paying customers are to park. Most of the employess are Hispanic and they don&apos;t care, just like coming over here illegal and trashing our country. 



 Michael 9/4/10 
 I was very pleased to see that a Taco Bell had opened here in Irmo South Carolina as I&apos;ve been a customer for 40yrs. On Saturday, September 4th at approx. 5:30, my wife stopped by to get some tacos, etc. I entered the store in which one register was open with a counter person attempting to take care of an order for another employee. It seemed that it took an inordinate amount of time to get the order straight and I foolishly thought the shift supervisor, who saw me waiting, would step in to help out. When the transaction was finally completed, I stepped to the counter expected to hear something like...&quot;Welcome to Taco Bell, may I help you?&quot; Nope, she stood there with a blank look on her face. Pretty much what you expect in most fast food locations but still irritating and I know that service is something that used to be provided in the &quot;old days&quot; but, oddly enough, service is still a priority in most other countries I&apos;ve lived in or visited. Beyond the lack of service at this Irmo location what has happened to the amount of ingredients in a taco? I know the economy is screwed and the profit margins are harder to attain but please give me a little more than a sliver of meat and lettuce. Oh, and a bit of sour cream would make my day. Allow me to speak to the lack of courtesy I observed while waiting on my order. An older lady had opened the door and was holding it to allow her husband and son to enter but were nearly run over by the three Taco Bell employees exiting. Not surprisingly, they did not say &quot;Sorry, excuse us&quot; or any words to that effect. The lady looked shocked at the behavior and appeared to be pissed. Since this location has recently opened, problems are to be expected and can be excused but employees here need to be trained in customer service and to focus on their purpose. I&apos;ll give it another shot but if I encounter the same, I&apos;m done with Taco Bell. Corporate needs to get a grip on what&apos;s happening at their stores or that profit margin will grow even less.

 My husband and I went to taco bell in Loveland OH. We were the only one in line and end up walking out. Cause nobody would come to take our order. Yes they did see us but didn&apos;t say a word to us. Not someone will be with you.

 Hi Help a Teen Staff,

I paid a dollar for my name to put on the front of the counter of Taco Bell in Elk Grove, California (8750 Elk Grove Blvd. 916-685-1133) and noticed when I when I arrive 5 days later it was taken down. The only thing i put on the front was San Francisco Gay Pride on the front and was taken down. There were plenty of room when I put my I felt that was disfranchise on Taco Bell part to do that with the permission of the customer. This was NOT derogatory whatsoever and I felt that I have the same right as everybody else to have put up with the rest. This is NOT controversial whatsoever because there is a lot of supporter and Taco Bell franchise in San Francisco who donates that very same reason. I told the manager at the store location and was very sarcastic and rude about the situation. I felt that this is discrimination on Taco Bell&apos;s part doing that because my donation is the same as everybody else and giving to the same cause. I would like some
kind of explanation or some kind of apology for this and tell me, is this is how Taco Bell conducts themselves with somebody donation and policy. This should not be a controversial subject because there is a lot of gay supporters who donation to plenty of worthy causes, and it should not be issue because I put San Francisco Gay Pride in front of &quot;to help a student tag&quot;. There is nothing that was brought to my attention of what I could write in front of &quot;tag&quot; as long it was clean. The clerk who read didn&apos;t have a problem with and help me put it up.

 taco bell in grand prairie on hwy 303 is a very poor establishment.My daughter worked there and was forced to leave due to harassment from fellow employees.Taco bell refuses to address this very serious situation and i expect an impending law suit.I would suggest to anyone that wants there children to work at such a discriminatory place to reconsider. 



 Amanda 8/26/10 
 Taco Bell on Henry St. Norton Shores, MI.

I do not eat steak, let me make this clear, I DO NOT LIKE STEAK, I WILL NOT EAT IT.

I order a Chicken Taquito, get home and it&apos;s a Steak Taquito. I&apos;m pissed off and give it to my brother.

A couple weeks later I order a Chicken Bacon Chalupa... &quot;Oh we don&apos;t carry those anymore.&quot; Really? How long did you carry it, 3 weeks!?! So I order a Chicken Taquito. I thought about checking it before I left the store, but I thought &quot;no, they wouldn&apos;t mess it up again.&quot; Oh how wrong I was. I get home, it&apos;s a Steak Taquito! I&apos;m pissed and call the store to complain. The manager never apologizes but asks if I&apos;d like to come back for a different one, or be mailed a coupon. I told her I would waste my gas to drive back over. But then I thought, what if the workers are irritated with me? What if they spit in my food? So I change my mind and go to Burger King. I call Taco Bell back and ask for the coupon instead. I asked what the coupon will be for, she says &quot;a steak taquito.&quot; I screamed &quot;Do you mean CHICKEN!?!&quot; Still no apology and she&apos;s says &quot;yes, I meant chicken.&quot; So about 3 weeks later I get the coupon in the mail... guess what my coupon is for... A FRICKEN STEAK TAQUITO!

I don&apos;t get it! I can&apos;t believe that the Web Admin approved a sexual review in the type of taco Alex would have. What does that tell you about taco bell

We appreciate your review, it will be added to our site as soon as a web admin approves it!

Web Admin.......please removed at once. I am sure I am speaking for everyone. It was uncalled for. I can&apos;t believe you guy&apos;s approved it.

The best customer service and food I have experiences is Chick Fillet. They care about their customers. I have only eaten there three times, but I can tell you, it&apos;s the best. It&apos;s closed on Sunday, because the owner is a Christian and does not believe in slaving their employees and (the) training that they have received is the best!

I am highly impressed with the owner and the way he cares about his business.

All Taco Bell customers, please take your business to Chick Fillet.

I had a taco bell about three weeks ago, which I became critically ill. I placed a call the following week, because I didn&apos;t have the energy and/or strength in calling and explaining what happened to me, much less to drive back to taco bell. When you call and complain, they make you feel like you&apos;ve committed a crime and you&apos;re a criminal and you&apos;re on trial.

I have rec&apos;d more than one phone call from HR, and she left messages. First of all, she was extremely rude when leaving the messages and when I didn&apos;t call her back, she would then call me back, the same day. I then called her back, and left a message, she returned my phone call back, but only to have berated over the phone, belittled me and insulted my intelligence. You name it, she said it. I was told that this HR person is the highest that there is in talking to someone.

I won&apos;t stop until I am heard. DON&apos;T EAT AT TACO BELL, BECAUSE YOU WILL GET FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 8/27/10 Normally a 5 star as I eat there every weekend. Tonight I ordered 2 mexican pizzas with no beans. Yes a pretty simple order and I got 2 mexican pizzas with beans. When I called to report this to the local manager she stated that she remembers ringing this up and then she hung up on me. I agree I am not the nicest person when I am angry and I was angry as I did not get what I ordered. It is not that difficult to get correct as you have a screen that tells you what to put on it. However she hung up on me because they made a mistake. If I would have gotten one sincere word all would have been fine. Things happen and people make mistakes, but I don&apos;t ever blame someone else for my mistakes. If this is the type of person that your company likes to employ then great, I will just stay away. Summerville, SC main street manager is rude and does not care about customers nor her job. I would never treat any customer with such disrespect. especially when I was in the wrong. Summerville, SC North Main Street Manager is rude and technically a thief. I paid for something I did not recieve and now have ill feeling toward a place I love so much. Creator of the 4th meal.

Sincerely,

A wronged customer

 Self proclaimed manager, Keith at the Green Bay Taco Bell on Mason Street shorted us some of our food. The lobby was closed, so rather than wait another twenty minutes in the drive up line I called the stored. The employees kept looking at me from inside, but wouldn&apos;t answer the phone. So I walked up to the window. He scolded me and said they were busy. I simply told him they didn&apos;t give me all my food. He said I would need to &quot;drive&quot; around like everyone else. Seriously!!! So because I got to the window on foot and not in a vehicle he can&apos;t hand me my nachos? And Keith, PLEASE take a shower. 



 Lava Lover 8/28/10 
 My husband is head over heels in love with your Taco Bell Lava sauce!!! I was able to talk a few staff members in selling me the entire bag of Lava sauce, but now I&apos;m not able to purchase anymore...what are we to do? He puts it on EVERYTHING!!!
Can we purchase this Lava sauce directly through Taco Bell HQ? 



 MARY jones 8/21/10 
 Stopped by Taco Bell on Oxnard Boulevard, Thursday August 19, 2010. First of all floors were dirty, tables were filthy and trash cans were overflowing with trash. I stepped up to the counter and mentioned to the kid behind the counter. &quot;Wow, this place is dirty&quot; kid, responded, yeah the baseball team was here. I immediately, thought to myself, why didn&apos;t someone CLEAN UP the place. I didn&apos;t think it was my place to say that. When I placed my order, I wasnt quite sure if the kid understood me, as Spanish was his first language. Fortunately my order was correct. 1 tostada.... 



 Connie G. Poole 8/3/10 
 On the way to IL. We stopped at your restaurant young man at the register was kind ,kept apologizing. 5 ppl working behind the line, including the manager, Unreal we waited 40 min for our food. Not to mention, customers orders were messed up big time, ppl getting other ppl&apos;s orders. My 16 yr old Grandson, and my 8 yr granddaughter waiting in moter room close by, they wanted Taco Bell, otherwise I would have left. Customers all around us were complaining. here. I could not believe that the Manager did not step up to counter and apologize to us all. I was a GM in the Restaurant for 22 yrs, this was so uncalled for. There was definitely no &quot;game plan&quot; here.
I lost count on how many customers were complaining about the long wait. I was shocked, fast food restaurant, really.
I filled out a survery on opinion.com/yum Just would never take my complaint, too many or too few character. Store # 019694 Kingston TN. Put in order @ 9:17 PM.

 Hi,

I have always liked the service and food from Taco Bell in Hidalgo area. I just recently moved to Kingsville. I have only been to the Taco Bell here three times. Service and quality of food is not good. I decided to stop by today at 11:00am because i was craving some crispi tacos, especial the meat that goes in it. today my food was cold. I was sitting down eating the tacos while a rep was cleaning the floor; I mention to the rep that the crispi tacos were cold. She was nice and told her manager. the manager shouted across the restraunant and said &quot;they just came out they are not cold, and if they are cold it is because of the fresh veggies and soure cream&quot; I believe she thought I was stupid. I decide to open a crispi taco to see how much veggies they put because i did not taste any meat; sure enought there was harly any meat - it was stuffed with veggies and soure cream. I decided to call the manager to my table and decided to show her the crispi tacos; she said that it was all the cold veggies but she would tell the cook add more meat. She tried to give me a free meal but I told her i did not her this because i wanted a free meal. I did not take the free meal. If Taco Bell would focus about hiring quality managers and focus on training them on good customer focus and their food; I strongly believe the company would prosper. Taco Bell makes good food when done right.

 Went to Taco Bell and had 2 regular crunchy tacos about 7 the other night. Only thing I had eaten since lunch. Woke up at 11 and was sick out of both ends. In the bathroom every 20 minuites until 4 am. Probably will never eat at a Taco Bell again. Obviously rotten food. Palo Alto , CALIFORNIA, East Charleston St.

 I went to Taco Bell today and placed an order. The cashier clearly did not speak English and was not able to communicate well or understand. PLEASE honor the United States and hire workers who can speak the language if they are working in an area where they need to communicate with customers. Then when I received the order, inside is a coupon, 1 side printed in English and the reverse in Spanish. You know, other countries, especially in England, do not even attempt to offer information in all the various languages of people who live there. There are so many different languages they could not possibly do so. However, the people who live there ... learn to speak English. Other countries look down on the United States because as a country we are allowing the responsibility of learning English to turn into a responsibiity of English speakers to learn or provide instruction in every other language. It is just silly. If you are going to employ people who do not speak English, do not have them work in a position that requires English. You are not respecting America.

 We went to one of your Taco Bells yesterday to try your new tacos with the lime wedges. My husband and I ordered 2 each of the pork tacos without the onions and the cilantro. When we opened our 4 tacos, we found about 2 level tablespoons of gooey shredded pork in each taco. What a shock because the ads on tv as well as the store posters show tacos filled with chunks of meat - so much so that the tacos were held open to show the contents bc they were so plump with meaty filling....a far cry from what we received when we ordered them. We had a tough time trying to unseal our tacos&apos; tortilla edges to see if there was anything in them bc they were so flat. What a waste of our money. HUGE DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING OF YOUR &apos;NEW&apos; TACOS WITH LIME!! The meat looked like canned goo and smelled like canned goo......we tossed them in the trash because it made us gag to think of eating them. 



 brandi 8/15/10 
 i visited a taco bell last night and accidently gave the server 14 bills thinking it was all ones three of the bills were hundreds just as i handed them to the server i noticed it, he lieds said no stole the money his name was alex and he was a store manager on the us 290 and senate. he put on the receipt that i gave him 14 dollars which i did but three of the bills were 100s. then he gave me 3 cents back but the receipt said i was suppose to get 2.03 and he knows that the other bills were 100s and has lied to the police and all. hope security cameras work !!!!!

 Just left Taco Bell store on East Hwy 50 in Orlando Fla, at 2:00PM. Store # 022791.
The mens batroom is filthy. No toilet paper, towels or hand soap.
Yet, the employee used the bathroom while we were there, and went back to serving food with out washing his hands with soap.
The sign on the door says the bathrooms are inspected every 30 minutes.
Taco Bell, you need to re-train these servers and there store manager.

 Debbie 7/8/10 
 Taco Bell in Canton,TX is a poor excuse for employment hiring. The store is not of the up most cleanest and is always having to rehire new people mostly of a young age that cannot keep their jobs. A young man by the name of Barry Deaver was hired over a year ago and he told them at the time that he had a felony over seven years ago due to a stupid incident that occurred when he was 18. He was told no problem and that he would be on probation to see how he handled his job. He has been an excellent employee never missing work, never late and always there when needed (when other employees didn&apos;t show for work). He has been a very hard worker and has even brought business to the store due to his efficiency and friendliness. Brings attention to needed ares to be cleaner and the employees look up to him. On June 6 they announced to the other employees that he was promoted to Shift Supervisor and has been doing an excellent job. Then on Tuesday July 6th (a month later) they tell him that he cannot be a shift supervisor due to his felony. Several employees were very upset and crying. Taco Bell was very inappropriate in their decision to wait a month to reverse the decision. Corporate should have been more smart to make a decision. That man was very embarrassed along with being mislead with the company and the corporate decisions that are very inappropriate. He is still working due to the economy and desperately needing the job but it has greatly disappointing and humiliating. I am also disappointed with the corporate policy in hiring procedures especially during these hard economic times and outsourcing of jobs. You have any employee that is willing to work at a low paying, hard working job and have ignored the opportunity. This letter doesn&apos;t mean much to your company but it does make me feel better. Corporation&apos;s need to review their hiring policy and keep American&apos;s that want to and are willing to work. He has two boys that he is trying to support as if anyone cares.

 I&apos;m done with Taco Bell. I get off work around 10:45 p.m. By the time I get to a Taco Bell close to home, I must use the drive-through. Three of the last six times I&apos;ve used the drive-through, I have gotten home, only to find the order incorrect. It&apos;s not any one Taco Bell. It has happened at three that I can think of. It&apos;s not that much money. It&apos;s the inconvenience and frustration of either not eating the incorrect food, or getting back into my car and returning to Taco Bell. Usually, I just throw the food away. Tonight, I returned and asked for a refund. The crew person informed me that I was only shorted one soft taco. Well, I already knew that. I had no desire to take home one almost warm soft taco and eat it along with now cold food. I asked again for a refund. I got it. But, the point is that I had to return in the first place. I&apos;m done with Taco Bell, and I&apos;m done with drive-throughs. 



 JAI LITTLEWOLF 7/12/10 
 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE PROBLEM STILL CONTINUES AT THE CALIMESA TACO BELL. NO BODY AT THE COUNTER TO WAITE ON ME BECAUSE THE DAM CLEAK IS OUT SIDE ON HIS CELL PHONE. WHEN HE FINDLY WAITES ON ME HE&apos;S OUT THE DOOR AGAIN ON HIS CELL PHONE AND I&apos;M GIVEN THE WRONG ORDER AND HE AND THE ASST MANAGER ARE OUT SIDE USEING THEIR CELL PHONES. I WILL NEVER BUY THERE EVER AGAIN NEITHER WILL MY FRIEND OR FAMILY. THE MANAGMENT HAS BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES AND WILL NOT DO ANY THING ABOUT IT. I&apos;M TAKING A STEP FARTHER AND WIRTE A REVIEW ABOUT THEM AND WARN OTHERS IN THE NEWPAPER I WORK FOR ABOUT THE CALIMESA TACO BELL AND THERE POOR EXCUSE FOR MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE. 



 SALLY STANDAR 7/14/10 
 WE VISIT A NEWLY REMODELED TACO BELL IN BRUNSWICK, OHIO ABOUT ONCE A WEEK AND FIND THE DINING AREA ALWAYS DIRTY! TABLES ARE NEVER KEPT UP AND CLEANED ESPECIALLY DURING DINNER HOUR WHICH NEVER SEEMS TO BE BUSY DUE TO THE FACT THERE IS NO CLEAN TABLES TO SIT. MAYBE SOMEONE FROM CORPORATE SHOULD PAY A VISIT AND GET THIS RESOLVED. PORTIONS OF MEAT ARE VERY SLIM ALSO!
