 Reviewing Montreal Restaurants Scene So Far 
 
 

 Montreal restaurants take you on the journey to Canada’s most fashionable cities where you can find several international eateries coming up regularly.

Most restaurants in Montreal are heavily influenced by flavors from around the word, more often with some added touch of Canadian and French flair.

Most restaurants in Montreal can be found in major locations and sometimes in some of the unlikely locations. For instance, city’s best restaurant like Restaurant Toque is nestled on the ground floor of one office tower in the financial district of Montreal. But, there are few other areas like Boulevard St-Laurent and Rue St-Denis between Mont Royal and Sherbrooke- well known for being the hottest dining strips of the city. You get everything out there, starting from high-end gourmet establishments to affordable and cheap sandwich shops.

There are few other major areas to look for. Like Revenue Duluth and Prince Arthur, two lively pedestrian streets right in the Plateau seemed to have started out with the ‘bring your own wine at the restaurant’ trend among the eateries located out here. Restaurants located along these two popular pedestrian streets mostly specialize in serving you relatively low but good quality meals.

The Downtown Montreal restaurants come clustered between Peel and rues Guy on the side streets which run between the rue Sherbrooke and boulevard Rene- Levesque. These ares also house some of the best known restaurants in Montreal. Some of the most interesting little restaurants and cafes have started up in the center of the Antiques district along Rue Notre-Dame Ouest close to Avenue Atwater.

The Old Montreal region also includes a sizeable collection of well-respected restaurants. Most of them are found clustered on the Rue St-Paul and the Place Jacques-Cartier. While placing your order at one of your selected Montreal restaurants , you can choose from table d’hote menu and a la carte menu.

Among table d’hote and a la carte, the former is the more economical option to choose from. The table d’hote is a 2 to 4 course package deal which provides interesting specials and may even take a lesser time to prepare. For a bigger indulge, you may consider the menu dégustation, which does include a 5 to 7 course taste menu offered by the chef at Montreal restaurants .

Menu dégustation usually includes salad, soup, sherbet, fish, dessert, a meat dish, tea and coffee. The sherbet helps cleanse the palate. At some of the finest Montreal restaurants, a menu dégustation along with a bottle of good wine may cost you more than $200.

Most restaurants in Montreal are bilingual, but few of them are in French. If you can’t understand what the dish is, you shouldn’t be shy about asking the wait staff. A good wait staff will be happy to help you explain the menu. If you choose to order from the French menu without help, then keep in mind that in French, an appetizer is referred to as entrée. This is unlike the American menu where main dish or plat principal is called as entrée. Within Montreal, dinner or lunch reservations are usually recommended on weekends.
