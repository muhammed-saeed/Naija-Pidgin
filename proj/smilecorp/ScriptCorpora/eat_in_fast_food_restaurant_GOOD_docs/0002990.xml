Check out the new Gyros sandwich

Provided by Judy&apos;s Book 

I saw this on a billboard and thought a gyro at a fast food restaurant? Right. Well, I was wrong. My husband brought a couple home last night for supper and they&apos;re really good. The roast beef is seasoned lightly. It is all roast beef. Most gyros are a mixture of beef and lamb. The cucumber sauce (I can&apos;t remember how to spell what it&apos;s really called.) is great. Cool and just a little spicy. It also has lettuce, tomatoes and red onions. The pita bread was very fresh. If you like Greek food, give it a try. I also recommend a couple of potato cakes on the side! Yum!The service at this particular Arby&apos;s is usually good. As with all fast food restaurants, you might want to check for condiments if you&apos;re going through the drive-through.
