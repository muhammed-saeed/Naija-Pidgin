The 24-year-old chef was experimenting with a recipe involving liquid nitrogen, which is used by chefs including Heston Blumenthal to freeze food, when there was suddenly an&quot;enormous explosion&quot;, according to a report in the Berliner Morgenpost.

The young man, from Stahnsdorf, near Berlin, lost one hand in the explosion, which occurred at his girlfriend&apos;s mother&apos;s house.

He was rushed to hospital, where his other hand was amputated and his condition was described as life threatening and he remained on artificial respiration.&lt;snip&gt;

 I know people who use liquid nitrogen as part of a medical/scientific company, and they have a lot of protocols for handling the nitrogen, canisters, and receptacles. (and they were making ice cream with it back in the 1960&apos;s) I get worried when I see people handling it in kitchen situations without safety gear, and using inappropriate containers for the nitrogen and the super-cooled resulting products.

Even really good restaurants occasionally do dumb things (I&apos;ve seen the youtube videos) with it like dipping 100% metal spoons into a bowl of the liquid while the spoon is being held in a bare hand, or not wearing protective eyegear.

 For those that are interested, there is a detailed article (in German) found here .

The money quote is this:

Quote
 Vermutlich explodierte das Behltnis, weil der Druck darin durch die Erwrmung der Flssigkeit massiv gestiegen war. In other words, the liquid nitrogen caused the container it was in to explode, because of the pressure buildup. This is why it is important never to put liquid nitrogen into a sealed container!The German article is, in this and other respects, far from the fear-mongering nonsense that&apos;s been propagated in the English-language press.

The article notes that his left hand was ultimately saved, not amputated as previously reported. Also, it&apos;s probably important to note that he was working in a house, not a professional kitchen, at the time of the explosion.

 Thanks mkayahara. I was interested in the additional information because the first article left me thinking WTF? It just didn&apos;t add up with the information they reported. The stuff doesn&apos;t just randomly suddenly explode for no reason at all. An inappropriate container is a whole different jar of gas though.
 It&apos;s kinda like wrestling a gorilla... you don&apos;t stop when you&apos;re tired, you stop when the gorilla is tired.

 I seriously doubt any analysis by any news reporter regarding energetic materials.  They usually only manage to get their own name correct.  

This article came to me via a chemical engineer.  There seems to already be a huge hole in the story including the good news that they saved one hand.  Meanwhile everyone covers up what they did so we may never find out what actually went wrong.  It&apos;s all in the name of safety.

 I can&apos;t speak for the article, but in general find that people who work with LNO2 don&apos;t respect its dangers as much as they should. This includes friends who are chefs, and friends who are molecular biologists!

Everyone I know is clever enough to prevent an explosion. What&apos;s worrisome is lack of eye protection (a small splash in the eyes is bad, bad news) and lack of respect for the problems associated with spills.

There are issues with big spills in enclosed spaces (suffocation). But a more likely problem is small spills that get inside your clothes. People get lulled into complacency by the cool way a blob of nitrogen just beads up and rolls off your hands. They don&apos;t stop to think about what happens if it falls inside your shoe and has nowhere to go. The result can be excised, frostbitten flesh, or amputated toes.

At a minimum, people should where lab goggles, roll up their sleeves, and kick off their shoes (or wear open shoes like flip flops).

 First off. Liquid nitrogen is dangerous. Frying oil is dangerous. Boiling water, pressure cookers, gas grills, fire, knives etc.

E-gullet can be dangerous as well obviously.

Please do not suggest to wear flip flops while working with liquid nitrogen. If you are supposed to wear gloves and goggles to be safe, then lets please suggest that people wear shoes and socks.

And, a drop of nitrogen in your shoe will not cause you to lose your toes or get frost bite.

But go pour some on your feet in flip flops and you could get burned.

I strongly disagree. Regular shoes and socks are the least safe thing to wear with liquid nitrogen. You&apos;re right that a drop in your shoe won&apos;t cause frostbite, but a big splash most certainly will.

There are two safe approaches: protective gear (boots that won&apos;t let any liquid in, with an apron or cuffs covering the tops) or no gear at all. Spilling LN02 on bare feet won&apos;t hurt you ... it rolls off just as it rolls off your hands. Flip flops are the same.

If you&apos;re in a commercial kitchen, obviously bare feet and flip flops are not going to fly ... but working with it at home, that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;d do.

 You must be a lot less klutzy than I am!     If the options are full protective gear or barefoot, I will absolutely choose protective gear. There are other dangers in even a home kitchen than the liquid nitrogen. Like, the heavy bowl full of that fresh ice cream that I just dropped on my foot. Doh!

 you used the word amputated ? And you did say if it fell in your shoes you would get frost bite.

And what&apos;s the difference if your at home or in a professional kitchen ? If your cooking then you could spill oil, drop a knife, etc ? Both more dangerous.

And now you suggest to either wear boots, BTW, I&apos;ve dealt with plenty of LN2 and never in 6 years under the most corporate of circumstance been asked to wear boots. Or, wear no protective gear.

wouldn&apos;t wearing partial protective gear be partially safer ?

I&apos;ve had very little actual experience with LN2, but I can see why street shoes would offer little to no protection from a LN2 spill.  The liquid nitrogen rolls off when spilled on bare flesh because it rapidly forms a layer of nitrogen gas upon which it floats and provides an insulating effect.  In a standard shoe the porous, absorbent nature of the materials shoes are made of would hold the LN2 in contact with the skin where it could cause frostbite.  Bare feet, or flip-flops allow the nitrogen to escape, where it is not held in contact with the foot.

I am not saying don&apos;t wear shoes and socks in the kitchen. I had an interesting triangular burn on my foot for sometime because I dropped a slice of pizza that had freshly come out of the oven onto my bare foot in my home kitchen.  It was an entertaining sight watching me run to the bathroom where I shoved my hot cheese coated foot under the bath spigot.

I&apos;m pretty certain that what happened here was a pressurized vessel exploding.  It says he stole the LN2 from his place of employment and I think it highly likely he did not have a Dewar with which to properly transport and store it.  So if he put it into a regular vacuum thermos then the pressure would build without release until the thermos ruptured.

I don&apos;t know about your home kitchen, but mine is a controlled environment. I&apos;m usually in it by myself, the pace is measured, and I won&apos;t get kicked out for failing to comly with the chef&apos;s (or OSHA&apos;s) rules. If I&apos;m wearing flip flops, which I often do on hot summer days while cooking, I&apos;m all the more careful when tossing food in a hot pan.

Then you&apos;re working for people who don&apos;t observe even the most basic industry safety rules and recommendations.


Quote

Yes. But street shoes are not protective gear, partial or otherwise, with LN2. They&apos;re a hazard. Like wearing a neck tie around a printing press.

(Edited to add: in previous post I wrote&quot;LNO2,&quot;which may or may not exist. I meant LN2)

This topic seems to have skidded off course. The cryogenic properties of LN2 have no bearing on how some guy in germany lost his hands mishandling the stuff.

The last major incident I could find involving LN2 was a midnite explosion at Texas A&amp;M where the tanks were old, decrepit, and had improperly installed stress relief valves.

It would appear to me that this guy had somehow put the LN2 under pressure or caused it to expand to a volume greater then his container could release the pressure. We can only guess as to what he was doing, but several reports I read indicated that he had taken the LN2 into the bathroom where the container&quot;Blew up&quot;. I can only guess that the guy must have added a too warm liduid to the LN2 container to get that type of effect. Or maybe he attempted to flush the LN2 to dispose of it after he was finished using it and it became compressed in the pipe after passing the elbow shaped gas trap.

Maybe he just screwed on the top of his ordinary thermos flask, to close it up nice and tight and stop his magic toy leaking away ... ?
It would be quite easy to&quot;explode&quot;any normal container, just by closing it.


Every 56 grams of N2 would like to be 22.4 litres of gas at about room temperature. (Avogadro.)
Translating that into US units, each 2 oz would make about 6 US Gallons of gas. Potentially quite quickly ...


There was a US Administration official who said it badly, but regardless of everything else he may ever have said, he was actually exactly right that it is what you don&apos;t know that you don&apos;t know that is dangerous.

A thermos, glass or not, would not keep it at room temperature. It would keep it much colder than that since it is in fact an insulated container. I&apos;ve seen plastic containers that had LN2 poured into it become brittle while frozen. But if a thermos were dropped, what would happen?

 It is making more sense now.
Looks like he brought it home in an ISI Siphon or the like (sealed). He then proceeded to try to open said (pressurized) siphon with a screwdriver in the bathroom (why) of his girlfriend&apos;s apartment. I&apos;m guessing he had the siphon between his knees at the time since the explosion blew a chunk out of one of his calves and also did significant damage to his naughty bits. Talk about adding insult to injury the local police also will be pressing charges against him.

If not a darwin award winner certainly a runner up.

Insulation only buys you time. No matter how well insulated the container, the LN2 is going to pick up heat from outside, and a certain amount will boil off. A cryogenic dewar (the only thing liquid gasses should be stored or transported in) is basically a thermos that can&apos;t be fully sealed. The better ones are spill proof, but still vent to the outside. A fully sealed thermos is 100% guaranteed to explode ... eventually.

 For years, I used LN2  in the lab.  It was kept in large thermos bottles.  Yes, the stuff is dangerous if not handled correctly.  Protective eyewear is necessary as mentioned above.  You don&apos;t wear flipflops or go barefooted that is asking for trouble.  The chances of t going into a shoe are small and it provides sufficient protection.  As for playing around with it....  You keep your hands away, only using non conductors such as gloves when putting things in, taking them out or manipulating them.  I have seen chefs spinning things in LN2 without gloves.  That is asking for trouble.  The stuff boils at -196C (-321F).  In less than a second your fingers will freeze solid.

 Mikels is right.  LN2 is used all over as a source of cold.  (I&apos;ve used it in various kinds of laboratories for many years.)  It&apos;s fairly benign stuff if you follow the simple precautions, which are second-nature for people who work with it.  Note that anything that builds pressure can cause an explosion if you put it in a closed container (I&apos;ve seen it happen with&quot;dry ice&quot;-- LN2&apos;s solid cousin -- and even beer).  Actually there are even other, rare dangers with LN2 because some solid objects, if they freeze in it, form internal stresses (rather like Prince Rupert&apos;s tears, or Bologna bottles -- both made from molten glass suddenly chilled).  In LN2, pink rubber erasers, for use with pencils, become like little ceramic bricks, but when taken out and left to warm up, they can fly apart from the internal tension.  A favorite prank of graduate students.  (Or so I hear.)  I&apos;ve been wondering if the same thing will happen from someone freezing solid food in LN2, who doesn&apos;t know about that effect.

 Another hazard that I don&apos;t think has been mentioned is that liquid nitrogen will condense oxygen from the air.  Liquid oxygen is very reactive and can cause explosions when in contact with organic matter.

Hey, if you want to play with the stuff, great. But invest in training - the chemical companies offer it all over, as do universities.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s any more dangerous than the stuff cooks deal with every day, just that different precautions are needed.
 It&apos;s almost never bad to feed someone.

 The main lesson here for kitchen people is REALLY simple.

 Don&apos;t ever, EVER, EVER close any liquid Nitrogen container. Ever.
Simple enough?
Not ever.
Never.
The stronger your closed container is, then the more damage that will be caused by the eventual, inevitable, explosion when it bursts.

If you don&apos;t know that, then all other advice would be wasted. Except the advice that if you don&apos;t know that, then you should not have anything to do with the stuff ...

 The main lesson here for kitchen people is REALLY simple.

 Don&apos;t ever, EVER, EVER close any liquid Nitrogen container. Ever.
 
Well ... a liquid nitrogen dewar is designed to be closed. They close without creating an airtight seal. Except for the pressurized ones, which have a pair of relief valves.

So don&apos;t ever close a container of LN2 unless it&apos;s designed to be closed.

Yes, the chances of it going into a shoe are small.
But does a regular shoe provide sufficient protection? Debateable at best.

I&apos;ll challenge anyone to this: I will happily, with witnesses or on video, pour a fluid ounce of LN2 onto my bare foot.

Will anyone here volunteer to pour the same amount onto the opening at the top of their shoe? I sincerely hope not.

 The context is cooking in kitchens, full of hazards for foot injuries.

Unless you&apos;re prepared to expand the offer to things like boiling sauces, or knives and forks falling from table height, I think the point is moot and not worth belaboring.  (I&apos;ve always worn closed shoes when working with LN2, btw, in labs with safety standards.  Flip-flops would not be allowed or sensible, for the same reasons as kitchens.)

 How are the splash-related hazards of liquid nitrogen any more dangerous than they are for boiling oil in, e.g., a deep fryer?

If people in the kitchen simply think of LN2 as the&quot;cold equivalent&quot;of boiling oil, a lot of problems would be solved.  Splashing boiling oil on your foot or in your eye is not such a great thing either, and yet every fast food restaurant in American has a fat fryer.
