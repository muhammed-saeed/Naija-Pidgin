 uPick Idiotech Technology fails See All» Up +63 Down Bisexual, sure, but she&apos;s no adulterer. 
A few weeks after my mom had gotten a facebook, I checked out her profile to see what exactly she put there. She listed that she was both interested in men and women. I asked her why she never told me she was bi-sexual, and she freaked out. When I showed her that she put that on her profile, she said &quot;You&apos;re not supposed to put just men, or else people think I&apos;m looking to cheat ... Read More» on your father! So I put women as well to let people know.&quot;

 The golden age of porn lives on. A good rule of thumb: don&apos;t trust a naked guy unless it&apos;s after you&apos;ve already had sex with him. The theft of BBQ potato chips is the worst crime Canada has seen in 62 years. &quot;Ladies should be seen and not heard, but also not seen.&quot; The only political agenda movies should have is pro-explosion. If these propaganda posters were trying to convince us how weird they are, they&apos;re working. Are the words you are reading right now art? YOU DECIDE. Turns out Adele&apos;s been pregnant for the same length of time Rollin&apos; in the Deep was at number 1: nearly forever. Meet your area&apos;s hottest available douchebags!
