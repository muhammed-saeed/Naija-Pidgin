 Attention all Servers/Bartenders and Restaurant Patrons!!! I recently got a job serving/bartending for a restaurant in Toledo. The owner just imposed a new deduction on our paychecks: a .02% (which only added up to about $5 last pay period) ee has been passed on to employess for processing credit card tips. He stated in a note stapled to empolyees paychecks that this is not the full processing fee amount, but an amount he felt was fair enough to pass on to employees. Now, California has outlawed this practice (follow this link to read the law that was passed CA Codes (lab:350-356) ) and I think Ohio should make it illegal as well. It isn&apos;t fair to us employees to have to cover this fee if our customers decide to leave a tip on their credit card rather than in cash. We can&apos;t exactly ask them to leave us a cash tip, so this is in no way something we have control of. So why should it be our responsibility to cover a portion of the processing fee? The owner should only accept cash if he thinks that the fee is getting too expensive for him to cover. I haven&apos;t spoken to my coworkers about this, but I just want to get some insight from all of you. If you&apos;re a server/bartender does your employer also pass this fee onto you? Even if you aren&apos;t a server or bartender, how do you feel about this policy? I&apos;m considering taking legal action, but I&apos;m not sure if its worth all of the court and lawyer fees for a $5 deduction from each paycheck. Sure, that money will add up over time, but I don&apos;t exactly have the funds right now to go through the judicial process. What are your thoughts?
