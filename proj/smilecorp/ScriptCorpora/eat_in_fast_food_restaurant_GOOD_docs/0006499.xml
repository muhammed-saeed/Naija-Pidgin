 Study: Downsizing option leads to fewer calories consumed 
 February 16, 2012 at 2:57 pm by Steve Barnes, senior writer 
A study published in the journal Health Affairs finds that asking customers if they wanted smaller portions at fast-food restaurants resulted in an average reduction of more than 200 calories per diner. From the abstract:
 
we tested an alternative approach: activating consumers’ self-control by having servers ask customers if they wanted to downsize portions of three starchy side dishes at a Chinese fast-food restaurant. We consistently found that 14–33 percent of customers accepted the downsizing offer.…Labeling the calorie content of food during one of the experiments had no measurable impact on ordering behavior. If anything, the downsizing offer was less effective in changing customers’ ordering patterns with the calorie labeling present. These findings highlight the potential importance of portion-control interventions that specifically activate consumers’ self-control.

oh great, better not let the Albany Common Council see this! Then they’ll pass a law forcing fast food restaurants to offer customers the smaller sizes. Since the mandatory calorie counts on the menus obviously havent done jack.

Good grief, look out Albany county restaurants—New mandate on the way!

Just what I need, some 18yo skinny b!tch server asking my plump middle aged self if I’d like to downsize my macaroni. THAT will not end well.

“portion control interventions”? Don’t like the sound of that.

“Since the mandatory calorie counts on the menus obviously havent done jack.”

Maybe they haven’t done anything for you, but I *definitely* consider my choices better for seeing them. Do you go the 2 filet-o-fish deal ( 360 x 2 = 780 ) , or just get an angus bacon and cheddar ( 740 ).

If you’re paying attention to your caloric balance, you probably got less than 800 calories to spend on this meal, so choose wisely.

Speaking of.

Attention Five Guys:

I *really* wish I could eventually figure out how to get You Guys to just give me a CUP OF FRIES and not a BAG OF FRIES. I *appreciate* that it’s your hook, and that you want to work it, but seriously.

I’m ordering a single patty burger not just because your buns aren’t up to a double, it’s also plenty of food just as is.

I had thought once that I figured out how to convey this to the cashier, and they checked with the manager, and found out how to communicate this to the cooks, but alas, bag-o-fries once again, and more than half of them thrown away.

Sounds good, but I can’t see many businesses offering the consumer a reduction of potential profit.“You don’t really want fries, with that, do you?”

Comment by EZ—February 17th, 2012 @ 9:31 am 
 
Then throw the fries away, Mike. What’s it to you? If you’re really paying attention to your caloric balance then you know you shouldn’t eat all of them. Unless you have no self-control. Also, I’m ecstatic about the failure of the calorie posting measures.

PLLLTTTTTT! That’s me giving the Health Affairs people a big raspberry!

It’s not shocking that less food means less calories, is it?
But what the blurb doesn’t specify is, when these people are downsizing their meal, are they also downsizing the price? I think you’re going to be hard pressed to get a Chinese fast food restaurant to offer cheaper food than they already do and hard pressed to find an American who wants to spend the same amount of money for less food.

@1–I use the calorie counts to help inform decisions at restaurants. I’ve been really surprised to find that some things I thought would be lower calorie choices (and would have picked) were worse than the things I actually wanted to eat. And knowing that calorie spend helps me make better decisions the rest of the day.

@6–I’m with you. I would pay the same amt for a smaller portion there. The fries are yummy, but I want to eat them all!

EZ:

“14–33 percent of customers accepted the downsizing offer, and they did so whether or not they were given a nominal twenty-five-cent discount.”

“Then throw the fries away, Mike.”

Sure, rather than eliminate waste, just fill up the landfill, and as a bonus starving people can just dig through the bags of garbage in the dumpster for something to eat.
