We ate at this restaurant location, in December 2011. It was excellent. Service was friendly and food was awesome. We are planning on returning on our next trip to Sudbury. Portions are massive (I had to take half with me!) and filling.

I recently went to their new location in the South End of town, and thought the service was fantastic. The food was hot, fresh and very well presented. The atmosphere was warm, comforting and exceptionally clean. It was a very nice experience, keep up the great work.

How do you figure spooner that it&apos;s a grease spoon when there isin&apos;t even a deepfryer in the building. I love the restaurant and go there every weekend. If you are going to have a comment you should make sure the facts are straight first!!!

I like the food, however the servers need etiquette training. Being referred to as &quot;hon&quot; is very annoying and disrespectful. We used to visit weekly, but I now rarely go. Perhaps I should go back and let the manager and/or servers know that calling me &quot;hon&quot;, &quot;dear&quot; etc. = no tip!

I have been to tutti frutti on several occasions. I used to be a waitress down south and for me the service is seriously lacking. First off a smile is always a good way to greet someone. The floor staff do not look to be enjoying themselves at all. The hostess should most certainly be promoting specials. Drinks should be served right away and topped up often. Tables aren&apos;t getting cleared fast enough (is there even a bus boy/girl??) and the waitresses saunter through the restaurant like bears getting ready to hibernate. It&apos;s obvious there will be a wait for food when there isn&apos;t an empty seat in the house. So keeping in mind that it isn&apos;t a fast food restaurant is understandable. And if it&apos;s excellent food than it should be well worth the wait ;) As for the food though, you can tell that the homefries are frozen (not fresh). For a restaurant such as this one to be promoting a higher standard they certainly aren&apos;t paying attention to detail when it comes to freshness of fruit. And that just speaks volumes with regard to poor training and poor leadership. All the comments about cold food is disappointing because that means the fluidity in the kitchen is lacking if the eggs are waiting for the bacon...also demonstrates that the owners are amateur as they likely have not appointed a leader in the kitchen or they just aren&apos;t paying their cooks enough to give a shit. If you want quality in the kitchen, you must ensure that your staff feel valued. My impressions and that of many by the looks of it....poor training on the floor and lack of leadership in the kitchen...seems to me the owners just aren&apos;t paying attention or maybe not listening to what their staff have to say.

What a rip off!! Went for the first visit. It was a special birthday and we asked if the birthday breakfast was free. We were told yes. After poor service and a cold meal we received our bill and were told that it was the cheapest meal on the bill which was a kids meal. 4.95. Will not go back.

I am from Sault Ste Marie and the hostess at the motel I was staying at recommended this restaurant. Well for starters, let me tell you this. It was the best crepe I ever had. The whip cream was delicious and the fruits were fresh. The hostess was curtious, the restaurant was clean and I strongly recommend this place to all who love to eat healthy foods. I give this restaurant 5 thumbs up and 10 gold stars!

 Fruitti 2010-09-16 08:45:03 ★☆☆☆☆Poor 1 out of 5
WOULD DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND I was there on September 15 around 9 am, there was maybe a half dozen people in the restaurant and first we were not able to sit where we wanted even though the restaurant was empty and that was because the waitress had told us she did not want to walk too far to bring our food, secondly, even though the restaurant was empty we still waited 40 minutes to receive cold bacon and eggs and dried out disgusting looking fruit on a rusted piece of lettuce. Thirdly, we only seen our waitress twice, once to bring our cold food and once to bring our bill. I am just glad I didn&apos;t receive the bill because I would of had a lot to say about the overpriced garbage.

I went into tutti frutti this morning and i really enjoyed the service i received, i had a wonderful waitress who was always there filling up my coffee and asking us how everything is. I always see the blonde manager walking around with a sad look on her face ( my husband always wonders why she looks so sad. i am very disappointed that you can not substitute homefries with tomatoes. Earlier on in the year they used to give us tomatoes for free but now we have to pay a dollar or sumthing like that. It seems to me that everytime i go in i have to pay extra for what i want. Its un professional, sometime you just need to make your customers happy. Tomatoes arent that expensive so to me it shouldnt be such a big deal. I work in a restaurant and they always try and please the customer the best way they can. Although The fruit is delicious the eggs are usually never cooked the way i like it.

To be honnest the only thing i am really satisfied about is the excellent service receive when i go.

A morning breakfast experience that took 3 hours is not one worth having in my books!!
Our waitress approached our table within 2 minutes of sitting down, asked what we wanted to drink, we ordered then it took her 30 minutes to bring us our first coffee and even then I had to go find a Manager to complain that we had been waiting 27 minutes for our coffee in order to get it! The food was nothing special, you could get it anywhere else and I&apos;m sure anywhere else would give me a million times better service. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!

My first visit to Tutti Frutti Restaurant today, was a wonderful experience. The quality of food was excellent, hot and attractive, and very ample serving. With the cost of produce, tomatoes, and fruit so high, don&apos;t know how they keep the prices so reasonable. Our server and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Will return again often.

I have been to Tutti Frutti several times since it has opened. The food is amazing, the service is very good, the restaurant is the cleanest one I have seen in this city and the prizes are really fair for the amount of food you receive on your plate. I leave Tutti Frutti feeling very full and satisfied. I will return over and over again. Hats off to the owners!!!

I have been to your restaurant three times now.

The first time, the waitress when I ordered diabetic syrup told me the cost and I agreed but while I was eating I realized that this was discrimination. I told her and she spoke to a manager and they removed the cost from my bill.
The second time I went I did not pay the bill (another person paid) so I am not sure if they charged me or not. The last time I went the waitress informed me of the cost and I told her I would not pay and she agreed. It was not on my bill when I paid. I am diabetic and I cannot believe that you try to charge $0.60 per container of diabetic syrup. Why do you discriminate? You do not charge the average customer who uses the syrup on the table.

I must say that the quality of the food is not up to the first time I went. The fruit was going bad the last time (grapes and pineapple). I would rather have less choice and more quality. I have spoken to two people who went last weekend and both commented on the quality of the fruit.

I may give your restaurant one more chance.

Diabetic and living with it.

Had a very good experience there. Service was a little slow, but better than most. Mom, daughter and i enjoy the fresh fruit with everything we orderd.
I&apos;m going back in the morning will let you know if the 2nd time around is as great. Give the new guy on the blook a break, not easy to please the Sudbury group. I have live here all my 50 years and it&apos;s a tough market.
I would say give it a try before you knock it.

My wife and I were in Sudbury for the long weekend and visited Tutti Frutti for the first time.We truly enjoyed the experience.I had a bacon and eggs plate and my wife tried a fruit plate.The food was excellent and creatively prepared.The service was awsome.Smiling and curteous staff made the experience pleasant.The morning of our return home,we decided to go back so i called our dauther and invited her to have breakfast with us at Tutti frutti.She was also impressed.I only have one complaint. We were sitting in line by the door and whenever someone opened it we felt the draft. I wonder how they handled that during the winter.

 Hunnam 2009-05-18 14:57:35 ★★☆☆☆Fair 2 out of 5
My husband and I have been there twice. Both times, the waiting area when your trying to get a table is chaotic. When finally seated, the waitress on both occasions after taking our order rarely checked on us, the wait for the food was atleast 45 minutes, and because of the lack of service, our coffees were not refilled on either visit. I also noticed that there were bus boys standing around looking lost when there were many tables to be cleared. We probably wont be back, but we thought it was worth a second try. Prices are rather high for breakfast, yet you do get quite a bit of food, and the fresh fruit is nice.
One last thing, our order on the second visit was not accurate, but after the wait it wasnt worth fixing it..we were hungry and didnt want to wait any longer.

Good Afternoon April22/09

We had breakfast this morning. I was not impressed. The food was cold we ask for no butter on our toast guess what we got butter on our toast.We didn&apos;t see our waitress only to bring our breakfast and our bill. What ever happened to a refill on your coffee at almost $2.00 a cup I would expect a refill.For the $ 27.00 we paid we could go to a brunch for all you can eat for that price. We own our own business and I know how hard it is to satisfy everyone but I think there is lots of room for improvement.

Sudbury has welcomed the new Breakfast and Lunch with open arms. The restaurant is clean, nicely decorated, and the food, spectacular at a reasonable price.

Waiting time is worth it. The food is freshly prepared for each order. There are fresh fruits and not canned. The menu has satisfying dishes to please every pallet and price.

I invite you to see for yourself and enjoy the best breakfast experience you will ever had.

After waiting at the door for over 40 minutes, and then getting seated and waiting an additional 40 minutes or so for our food, we concluded that it was not worth the wait! This is our second time here, and we returned because the crepes were AMAZING! However, this time around, my husband ordered the Spring of 92, and it was awful! Not good crepes at ALL!

I will not take the chance again on this place. I will not wait over an hour to get food that may or may not be good. It is not consistant at all.
