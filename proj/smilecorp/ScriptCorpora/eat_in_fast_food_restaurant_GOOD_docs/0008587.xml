From the Kansas City Star&apos;s (Letters) 

 Recycled bad projects 
 Grandiose but failed public projects have a familiar sound to them, and some of the names of the players keep popping up.
 Years ago, Eric Wade, now Lenexa’s (Kansas) city administrator, held the same job with the city of Merriam (Kansas) when the city condemned the land at Interstate 35 and Shawnee Mission Parkway so that Baron BMW could build a dealership there.
The taxpayers of Merriam were forced to contribute a lot of money to help Baron buy the land, which the city forced the then-owners to sell, against their will, at a fire-sale price.
The taxpayers of Merriam were most unhappy and in the next city election voted out all four councilmen who were running.
Eric’s good friend and supporter, Merriam Councilman Mike Scanlon , took a job as city administrator for Mission (Kansas) . His handiwork is the former Mission Mall.
If these projects were lucrative deals, then wealthy investors would build them. 
 Instead, the taxpayers foot the bills and assume the risk.
Olathe has its Great Mall of the Great Plains, Independence has the Bass Pro Shop project and Branson has the Factory Merchants Mall.
Sure, some people made money, but it came from the citizen-taxpayers.

Syracuse councilors pass 30-year tax deal for proposed Syracuse University bookstore

Published: Monday, July 09, 2012, 2:20 PM Updated: Monday, July 09, 2012, 2:51 PM 
 By Tim Knauss, The Post-Standard The Post-Standard 
Syracuse, N.Y. -- The Syracuse Common Council today narrowly passed a 30-year tax exemption for the developer of a new Syracuse University bookstore and fitness center.

 Council voted 5 to 4 to pass the deal. (Camron Group is the owner of Mission&apos;s Gateway Project) 

 The Syracuse Industrial Development Agency approved the PILOT in February for Cameron Group LLC , the developer of the project at 601 University Ave. Under the deal approved by SIDA, Cameron would pay the city $64,400 a year for 30 years—about 17 percent of what the property would owe if it were fully taxed.

 SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- City councilors have been summoned to a special meeting Monday to vote on a controversial 30-year tax exemption that would pave the way for construction of a new Syracuse University bookstore and fitness center on University Avenue.
 The meeting will be at 2 p.m., an hour after the start of the council’s regular 1 p.m. meeting. 
 The proposed payment-in-lieu-of-taxes deal is resurfacing for the first time since March, when the item was withdrawn from the council agenda because it faced certain defeat.
 The Syracuse Industrial Development Agency approved the PILOT in February for Cameron Group LLC, the developer of the project at 601 University Ave. Under the deal approved by SIDA, Cameron would pay the city $64,400 a year—about 83 percent of what would be due if the property were fully taxed.
 The site is currently tax-exempt because it is owned by Syracuse University, which plans to lease it to Cameron Group for $1 a year.

 Did We Have A Need To Know? 

 In less than a month the City of Mission Kansas has been heavily criticized for the less than transparent activities. Last Tuesday June 12th at 3:00 PM a confrontation occurred at Mission’s City Hall between City Administrator Mike Scanlon and myself over what I perceived as secret meetings between our City Council members and Tom Valenti a principal for the Cameron Group LLC out of New York the owners of Gateway project formerly Mission Mall.

 I find it odd for the City to say they got the highest rating possible on their audit. I guess it is technically true, the implication is not. It implies there is a quality ranking of some sort in audits. There is no quality ranking. There are only two types of audit opinions, unqualified (pass), and qualified (fail) with exceptions noted. A very high percentage of opinions are unqualified. The unqualified opinion means the reports are presented fairly and you did not report something in an odd manner. They do not say anything a bout the quality of the decision making, i.e. was it a good idea to give the Cap Fed site away for $10.00? That is not addressed.

 Our First Editorial 
 (Submissions are welcome) 

Let&apos;s see....no STAR bonds, no aquarium and no hotel (wonder what will replace them?) no office building until tenants are signed, no financing lined up and no final plan approval from the city until they have a better idea of what Cameron Group is planning to build. All these little items to take care of and still predicting a fall ground breaking?

Assuming Wal-Mart will go along with it, Tom Valenti may decide to ask to build the project in stages. To avoid the risk of Wal-Mart losing interest, Valenti may ask if they can build their store first, which raises the question of whether or not Cameron Group can also finance the construction of a multi-level parking deck at the same time (these things cost a lot of money)...... and whether or not Wal-Mart will allow them to build additional retail on their roof at some future date.

We all would love to see something happen on the East side Wasteland but, a fall construction start??......rather doubtful

And then there’s Keystone Automotive Group formerly on Johnson Drive, yep,,, their gone, somewhere on I-35 I’m told. Maybe the city will buy that too before a used car (we’ll finance here) lot goes in.

 Something stinks in Mission, Mayor McConwell 
By: Yael T. Abouhalkah (KC Star)

Mission Mayor Laura McConwell has worked hard to redevelop the big hole in the ground at the Gateway Center location off Shawnee Mission Parkway.
On Tuesday she found out the long-planned aquarium and a hotel would not be coming .
Her comment?
“We didn’t count on the aquarium to begin with…I think the council is excited about the mixed use and the residential component.”
I’m sure they are.
But McConwell and other Mission officials were plenty excited about the aquarium a few years ago, especially when they thought it might get them state STAR bonds to get the project off the ground. Read More : Of Yael Abouhalkah&apos;s story

_______________June 12th 2012 ________________
 
Good evening, Bill:

As a follow up to your conversation with Tom earlier today, below please find a copy of the statement regarding the Mission Gateway development update
.
Statement by Tom Valenti, Managing Partner, The Gateway Developers, LLC:“After thorough research on how best to enhance the Mission Gateway project, the decision was made for the project to not utilize STAR Bonds from the State of Kansas. Without the inclusion of STAR Bonds funding, the Mission Gateway project will no longer include a hotel or aquarium. The Mission Gateway project without the aquarium or hotel returns to the developer’s original proposal that the people of the City of Mission supported eight years ago. The focus of the Mission Gateway project will specialize on serving as an ideal space for retail–including Walmart–restaurants, residential, and entertainment uses and focus less on potential tourism opportunities.

It’s important to note that as the developers, we originally promoted the inclusion of the Aquarium in the project and the utilization of Star Bonds, an effort that was also embraced by the City of Mission. We know that exclusion of the Aquarium and Star Bonds is disappointing, but the state of the bond market and the commercial financing challenges for tourist attractions and hotels compels us to move ahead with the project as quickly as possible without those components.

Since acquiring the Mission Gateway property in 2005, we have been focused on working with the City of Mission to ensure the development meets the needs of residents, bringing revenue and value to the area. Though the scope has changed, our goal has not. We’re eager to break ground on this development and serve residents, retail visitors, and office tenants, and look forward to infusing new energy into the crossroads of this vibrant community.”

 The Prairie Village City Council on Monday narrowly voted down a motion that would have put a referendum for a 3/8 percent sales tax increase to fund parks improvements and maintenance before city voters in November. 

 

 Parks projects, like the recently completed improvements at Weltner Park, will continue to be difficult to move forward without a dedicated parks funding source, said proponents of the sales tax. 

 The issue came before the council after the city’s finance committee and parks committee worked on options to find a permanent funding source to move the city’s Parks Master Plan forward. Approved unanimously by the City Council in 2008, the Parks Master Plan calls for roughly $14 million to be spent improving city parks, trails and bike accessibility .
But finding the money to move the master plan forward has been a struggle over the course of the past few years as city revenues have stagnated and major infrastructure issues—like deteriorating roads—have demanded significant investment from the city’s Capital Improvement Projects budget.

 KCP&amp;L Has Applied to the KCC for Another Rate Increase 

 KCP&amp;L Files Rate Increase Request with Kansas Corporation Commission
KCP&amp;L seeks to recover costs to maintain reliable service and meet state and federal renewable and environmental mandates
Press Release: Kansas City Power&amp;Light Company–Fri, Apr 20, 2012 5:11 PM EDT
KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Kansas City Power&amp;Light Company, a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Incorporated (NYSE: GXP - News), today filed a rate increase request with the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) to increase base rates for electric service in its Kansas service area. The company is seeking to raise rates 12.9%. If approved, the daily increase for a typical residential customer is expected to be $0.41. The rate increase request process takes approximately eight months in Kansas. New rates will not be effective until January 2013.
“While KCP&amp;L continues to manage costs and minimize the amount and impact of any rate increase on our customers, the costs associated with generating and delivering electricity continue to increase,”said Terry Bassham, KCP&amp;L President and Chief Operating Officer.“Specifically, our investments in additional renewable energy and environmental upgrades at our existing facilities are important steps to building a balanced generation portfolio and ensuring that we are doing our part to improve regional air quality.”
Among the drivers for the increase are the significant investments the company has made at its generating facilities that will allow KCP&amp;L to meet future state and federal renewable energy and emissions control mandates. These investments include additional wind generation in Spearville, Kansas and environmental upgrades at its La Cygne Generating Station, one of the company’s largest coal-fired generating facilities.

 At the Mission Kansas City Council workshop the topic was the swimming pool. This time last year Mayor Laura McConwell appointed a“Swimming Pool Task Force”to study and make recommendations as to the future of the pool. 

 

 After about an hour of conversation what appeared to be a consensus to funding repairs to the existing pool or building a new swim center. 

 

 A new sales tax will most likely be put forward for a vote of Mission residents in November. Several figures were discussed 1/8¢; 1/4¢etc. depending on a 2 + million dollar fix or more than double that for a new pool. Also to be determined by I assume the city council is the length of the new sales tax, 10 years, 15, 20 years?

 Governor Brownback signs pro-growth tax legislation 

 Topeka–Joined by small business owners, state legislators, Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors, Governor’s Cabinet members and Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, M.D., Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed one of the largest tax relief measures in Kansas history into law today at the Capitol in Topeka. The new law cuts state income tax rates for all hard-working Kansans by 14 to 24 percent and eliminates state income taxes on more than 191,000 small business owners.
Governor Brownback likened Senate Sub. for House Bill 2117 to a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.

 Deep cuts could mean drastic changes for The Jo bus system 
 Johnson County’s bus system has averted a crisis for now but must plan for major cutbacks 
 As Missouri-side officials seek to expand transit with plans for commuter rail and downtown streetcars, Johnson County is headed in the opposite direction.
After years of expansion, The Jo bus system faces such severe cutbacks that some say it’s in danger of being dismantled.
“It would be a tragic step backward,”said Ed Peterson, county commissioner.
Deep cuts that seemed imminent a few weeks ago have been put off for now. But because of cash constraints and cautious support for public transit from a majority of the seven commissioners, Johnson County transit officials began last month drawing up plans for dramatic service reductions.

 Mr. Scanlon has a diverse background as a business man apparently in the computer software business, an employee for the city of Merriam Kansas and a Councilman for Merriam before coming to Mission as City Administrator.  

 

 The CDC meeting at Mission’s City Hall was an unusually long one with 13 different topics. Numbers 3, 4&amp;5 had to do with spending more money on streets. All eight Councilmember’s were present with only 4 being allowed to vote to table the topics or send them to the City Council for a vote to spend or decline another $ 406,000 which they did agree to send. Councilman Lawrence Andre stated that he could not support the expenditure at this time, Andre did not appear to get much support from the other three voting Councilpersons; Will

 Financial concerns help push incumbents out 

 Roxie Hammill 
 Special to The Star 
 Prairie Village and Mission each will swear in three new council members next week, after voters there ousted all but one incumbent.
Fiscal concerns appear to have motivated many of the losses April 3, when voters replaced some longtime city council incumbents with newcomers—by startling margins in a few cases. It’s a safe bet that any plans to increase taxes or fees in those cities will have a tough go, say several incoming and outgoing council members, although there won’t be newcomers to drastically change the balance of the councils. In Mission, two of three incumbents were voted out, including Sue Grosdidier, a 24-year veteran of the council, and Connie Footlick, who has held a seat since 1994. Patrick Quinn, with no prior public experience, defeated Grosdidier with 67 percent of the vote; Jennifer Cowdry beat Footlick with 56 percent 
 &gt;snip&lt; Mission’s Ward 4 councilman, David Shepard, was the only incumbent who won in those cities. He defeated Allen Anderson with 64 percent of the vote. In Ward 2, where no incumbent was running, Amy Miller nosed past James A. Brown by just 19 votes. In Mission, the losses appeared to be a rebuke of Mayor Laura McConwell’s vision. Challengers were concerned about the city’s transportation utility fee, passed in 2010, and city debt. Read the entire story by: Clicking Here

Can Kansas City support two large aquariums?

That does not scare off a developer who plans a bigger and, he says, better aquarium just a fewminutes away in Mission. It was first suggested in 2007, but the site remains vacant today and financing is uncertain. Read More

Representing the people of the 24th District in the House of Representatives has been an honor and privilege. I will always be grateful for the opportunity the people of the 24th District gave me to represent them in the Kansas Legislature. I have worked hard with the Johnson County delegation to promote quality public education, job creation and tax fairness for the people of Kansas. Read More

New Driveway Tax Proposed

(I knew we were getting hits from Europe, but this?)

 The EU have proposed a 0.5% levy on the value of a property which has the use of a driveway. The benefits include:-
- A EU wide environmental strategy to assist urban wildlife habitats to reclaim from urbanisation
- Socio-economic benefits designed to assist equality with home owners and tenants
EU Corporate Finance Director (EU North West Zones 1a-7c) Uve Vorlenvoritt stated“The initiative is necessary is assist environmental management and to promote a deficit reduction programme.”Anticipating a strong press reaction, Paul Den Uddervun (Media Relations) commentted“We expect to introduce the taxation with an option to charge the costs against the property. The Finance (F) rate will be officially set at APR (F) 001% which will enable the home owning motorist to determine what it actually is.”

Regarding the 2012 budget, Moody&apos;s rating&amp;the budget forcast for 2012-2016

My problem is the Moody&apos;s rating is built on a house of cards. They are assuming certain things about the City will continue somewhat as they are now. Bruce Kimmel, Senior Financial Advisor, Ehlers Corp did tell the City they would not like to see them draw down the General Fund any further. Guess Mike Scanlon did not send Kimmel his Budget Forecast for 2012-2016, which shows the General Fund, will be more than wiped out. Also, what if the City loses the lawsuit on the Driveway tax and has to refund it. They couldn&apos;t balance the 2012 budget, why should we believe they can handle things if they get more complex.

 Township 5 now five years in the making, but the shopping center project near Syracuse is still developing 
 By Bob Niedt / The Post-Standard - March 30th 2012 
 &gt;snip&lt; It was 2007 when associates with East Syracuse-based Cameron Group LLC first filed a business certificate for the name of what was to be a bold new project for New York state, a project moving at the speed of Destiny USA. &gt;snip&lt; Township 5 was“bold”and“new”because it was a planned as a“lifestyle center,”then a hot concept in open-air shopping center development, with none of its kind anywhere in New York. 

As proposed, Township 5 includes housing—apartments—retail, entertainment, restaurants and more in a pedestrian-friendly environment.

 It was to be a step further than anything similar, such as predecessor Towne Center at Fayetteville, the higher-end COR Development project that isn’t entirely pedestrian friendly—and doesn’t have living spaces.
Joe Goethe, a partner with Cameron Group , said some leases have been signed—we’ve told you about a hotel and cineplex—but the snail’s pace movement of the project can be pinned on the Great Recession, as we’ve mentioned yearly since 2009. Read More

 &gt;snip&lt; Tom Valenti, one of the principals for the developer, Cameron Group, said when the council asked him Friday if he would be willing to talk more, he agreed, even though the project was first proposed in 2006. 
 A tax-break deal for a new off-campus bookstore and fitness center for Syracuse University has gotten a reprieve.
 The deal was slated for a vote in the Syracuse Common Council today, which, based on a whip count of the councilors, would have voted the deal down.
 Instead, the council withdrew the legislation from the agenda, giving the project a shot to revise and resubmit. Read More

Sidewalks—and easily walkable grid street plans—come and go throughout the neighborhoods, following the whims of past developers. Merriam has two bike routes, but one is mostly aimed at recreation.

 Mission’s Gateway plan raises concerns from legislators 

 Joel Petterson - The Kansas City Star 

The conflict between Mission and Roeland Park over a $200 million development project reached Topeka on Wednesday as the Kansas Commerce Secretary testified before legislators about the state’s STAR bonds program.

 After encouraging members of the House Commerce Committee to renew the bonds program, which is set to expire on July 1, 2012, Secretary Pat George fielded questions from representatives, some of which addressed the Gateway project in Mission. 

 The project has been challenged by neighboring Roeland Park for using STAR bonds in a project that would include a Walmart store, replacing the existing store at 5150 Roe Blvd. Some legislators shared the city’s concerns that the tax incentives were being used to create competition for existing businesses instead of building unique destinations like Kansas Speedway.

 Kansas eyes end of popular development program
Posted on Wednesday, March 07, 2012 

 By Gene Meyer | Kansas Reporter 

 TOPEKA—A decade-old initiative that helped bring NASCAR to the state could go behind the wall for good June 30. 

 The initiative, STAR bonds—shorthand for Sales Tax and Revenue—is a Kansas economic program that uses state and local sales tax money to help private developers build things such as posh shopping districts, speedways, riverfront entertainment districts and salt mine museums. Kansas uses STAR bonds money to help pay for streets, parking lots, sidewalks and other infrastructure 

 &gt;snip&lt;Kansas Commerce Secretary Pat George urged House Commerce and Economic Development Committee members Wednesday to recommend renewing the state’s STAR bonds program for another five years. The bonds already have brought $2 billion in investments and more than 30,000 jobs to Kansas, George said.

But committee chairman Anthony Brown , R-Eudora, said he is worried the program is becoming devalued and used to promote lesser projects that do far less to help the Kansas economy.

“I am not a big fan,”Brown said 

 &gt;snip&lt;“We’ve already watered it down from NASCAR to Heartland Park, ”he said, referring to a financially distressed Topeka racetrack that received STAR bonds funding in 2006. The track failed to produce enough sales tax revenue to pay off the bonds and, in 2010, Topeka sought help in refinancing the deal to cover interest costs, which were coming out of the city budget instead.

Unofficial results as of 9:12PM.

The results of Tuesday&apos;s primary is a direct indicator of how Mission&apos;s residents are feeling about the way the current administration has taken the future of our young families and put them in financial jeopardy. Us&quot;older folks&quot;are hurt by the over $45 million in debt we currently enjoy, but the young families have to live with this insanity for a very long time.
The residents in Wards 2&amp;3 spoke loud and clear in Tuesday&apos;s primary, the majority in overwhelming support for Amy Miller and Jennifer Cowdry, who both will bring sound fiscal discipline back to our city.

April 3 is the date for the general election for city council. The 4 candidates that Savemission.net endorses: Pat Quinn - Ward 1, Amy Miller - Ward 2, Jennifer Cowdry - Ward 3, Allen Anderson - Ward 4 , when elected, will provide the residents of Mission, with responsible leadership, to lead our city out of debt, and ridicule, and back to a place that is conducive for businesses and residents alike.

An aside: There were more residents voting in Tuesday&apos;s primary than voted overall in the last general election. Remember, Tuesday&apos;s primary was contested in only half of Mission&apos;s 4 Wards.

 Mission Gateway’s STAR bond plans face opposition from nearby cities 
 Kansas City Business Journal by Steve Vockrodt, Reporter 
 Date: Friday, February 24, 2012, 5:00am CST 

 A bid by the developer of the proposed Mission Gateway project for state incentives faces questions and outright opposition from neighboring cities.
New York developer Cameron Group LLC seeks sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds through the state to help it construct a mixed-use project at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Johnson Drive, where the old Mission Mall once stood. The Mission Gateway project became eligible for as much as $63 million in STAR bonds in 2007, but the project has gone through different iterations since then and has yet to begin construction. (End of Kansas City Business Journal copy) 

 Earlier this month the City of Roeland Park Kansas filed a petition with the City of Mission objecting to the East Gateway project which at Mission’s next council meeting on February 15th was not sustained by the council for lack of the required 20% of the adjacent property owners signing the document. Subsequently Roeland Park petitioned Secretary of Commerce Pat George in effect saying the Gateway Project has apparently been exaggerated in revenue&amp;benefits to the community. The petition appears to be specifically aimed at the STAR bonds for the proposed aquarium.

Developers work to solve tax-related problems with bookstore complex

 By Nick Smith 

 Contributing Writer Published: Monday, February 6, 2012 Updated: Tuesday, February 7, 2012 02:02 

 Tom Valenti Cameron Group 

 Developers for a new bookstore and gym complex on University Avenue, which will also include retail stores, have drawn up a plan they hope can solve tax-related issues that delayed construction, said Cameron Group LLC partner Thomas Valenti. 

 Since talks about a new complex started in 2006, Syracuse University, the Cameron Group and the Syracuse city administration have been at odds over how the complex would be taxed. 

 The property for the complex is owned by SU and has tax-exempt status, but the university plans to lease it to the Cameron Group for construction. Upon completion, the Cameron Group will re-lease the fitness center and bookstore to the university. Once the property is leased, it loses its tax exempt status, according to a March 7, 2011, article in The Daily Orange. Read More

 My thoughts on (TUF): By C. D. Rinck Sr.
Mission Kansas 
                                                                                                   
 This&quot;Fee&quot;is supposedly based on 8 trips per day, an arbitrary figure, for residential usage ($72.00 per year). I contend that my household (2 retired persons) makes approximately 10 trips per week.

Some of my neighbors who own 3 or more cars, have 2 or more working residents, and possibly 2 or more teen-ages/young adults who make that many trips per day.
 Therefore, since businesses don&apos;t pay the same amount as their next door business does, I am subsidizing my neighbors running habits by paying the same amount for 1/10th 
 the number of times I leave my driveway in my auto.

If this is allowed to stand, when do we see an increase in the&quot;Fee&quot;for increased costs to maintain our streets, signage, park maintenance, and whatever else it is slated 
 to be used for?
 

 Our constitutional right to vote yea or nay on such an issue has been trashed, one of the checks and balances used to harness the runaway imposition of slave tactics by 
 those who contend: &quot;You don&apos;t know what&apos;s for your own good so we&apos;ll tell you!&quot;

   In reference to the current
 squabble of adjacent cities who are less than amiable
 about the proposed&quot;East Gateway&quot;project in Mission , Roeland Park &apos;s position is understandable -- if there&apos;s a Chinamart in Mission , there won&apos;t be one in Roeland Park . Roeland Park isn&apos;t too keen about losing 30% of their sales tax base.

The reality is that if Chinamart is moved to Mission , the demographic of the clientele that frequents that big
 box retailer seems to be antagonistic to the type of upscale patronage the
 project is being advertised to attract. How many Chinamart shoppers will be attending esoteric cultural activities such as the proposed
 aquarium? Or stay in an upscale high-rise hotel? Or frequent an upscale fitness
 center? Or live in upscale residential space within the project? Pertinent
 questions for sure. What successful precedent of this proposed cultural clash
 is there? If this were to be such a grand vision, is the Country Club Plaza underutilized without the inclusion of a Chinamart? Those who promote the Gateway project advertise
 energetically the glamour of their upscale plan, but isn&apos;t the inclusion of a Chinamart an obvious red flag contradiction? Read More

Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt says Mission&apos;s&quot;Transportation Utility Fund&quot; (Driveway Tax) in his opinion is in fact a tax.

Link to: Attorney General Link to: KSHB 41 Link to: KC Star&apos;s 913 

 Sy nopsis: Under the Executive Aircraft test, the“transportation utility fee”(TUF) is a tax because it is a forced contribution on the owners of developed real property in the City of Mission levied for the purpose of raising revenue for 
 the maintenance of governmental services offered to the general public, 

 i.e. , maintenance of streets. The TUF is not an ad valorem tax because it 
 is imposed by calculating the estimated number of vehicle trips originating 
 from a property using a trip generation model rather than the value of real 
 property. As such, TUF is an excise tax that the City of Mission is specifically, clearly, and uniformly prohibited from levying or imposing 
 under K.S.A. 2011 Supp. 12-194. Cited herein: Kan. Const., Art. 12, Section 5; K.S.A. 2011 Supp. 12-187 et seq .; K.S.A. 2011 Supp. 12-194. 

The City of Mission Kansas&apos; City Administrator Michael Scanlon was contacted by phone today; Mr. Scanlon stated they are still reading the opinion but do disagree with portions. Scanlon further stated they should have an answer in a couple of days.

$200 million Mission Gateway project ready to lift off with Wal-Mart store

By KEVIN COLLISON and JOYCE SMITH - The Kansas City Star

 Wal-Mart plans to build a store in the $200 million Mission Gateway development, a decision that’s expected to give the long-delayed project and its saltwater aquarium attraction the boost to begin construction this spring. 

 Developer Tom Valenti of the Cameron Group of Syracuse, N.Y., said Tuesday that Wal-Mart had signed a letter of intent to put a 150,000-square-foot store in the project, which was first proposed in 2005. That’s when the former Mission Center was demolished at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Roe Avenue.
“We now have the rocket fuel to get the project off the ground,”Valenti said, referring to Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart officials could not be reached for comment. (For the rest of the Star&apos;s article click here) Click here

 Have you heard there could be yet another sales tax for the swimming pool in the spring? How about a fee for using the streetlights? City Administrator Mike Scanlon is talking about it.
The proposed budget for 2012 is not in balance, the current Mission City Council is spending more than we are taking in.
 Vote NO on another Mission Sales Tax.

 Info for Veterans 

 With Veteran&apos;s Day coming up I&apos;d like to post about a change in the law concerning rendering honors to the flag and during the playing of the National Anthem. 

 The Defense Authorization Acts of 2008 and 2009 had some interesting changes. 

 Veterans, and active duty military in civilian clothing now have the option of rendering the military style hand salute instead of the civilian hand over the chest salute. This applies to the raising, lowering or passing of the colors as well as during the playing of the National Anthem. 

 Those individuals who are wearing cover (hats/caps for the uninformed civilians) may keep the cover on while rendering the hand salute. If they choose to perform the civilian hand over the chest then they should remove their cover, and hold it over their chest.

 Important Note 2: As a reminder to all -- We (the City) can only provide objective information on the¼cent Sales Tax question. 

What do you think? Is the city presenting only objective information or very, very subjective and incomplete information?

Ask them if bonds will be sought which we must pay interest on. Ask them why this is (almost) exactly what TUF (AKA DriveWay Tax) is for.

 7 figures later, taxpayers frustrated with‘trail to nowhere’in Johnson County 
 By: Ryan Kath (KSHB TV News) To watch video click here 

 MISSION, Kan. - A walking trail in a Johnson County community does not sound too controversial on its surface. However, when NBC Action News discovered the seven-figure price tag—and then saw the visible results—taxpayers raised their eyebrows in surprise. 

 Trail causes frustration ------------------------ 

 -- For decades along Johnson Drive, Werner’s has been a go-to location for sausage and other German -- specialties. 

 -- Dave Miller has operated the Mission, Kan., staple for the past 16 years and it’s safe to say he knows a -- thing or two about food. But when the long-time business owner looks across the street, what he sees -- makes him lose his appetite.

Unified Government money worries raise red flags

 By MIKE HENDRICKS
The Kansas City Star 

 “Kansas Speedway waves green flag for economic success,”Wyandotte County’s Unified Government crowed in a news release on the eve of this month’s NASCAR race weekend. 

 

 And why not boast?
 
No government in the area has been more aggressive in promoting business development the last decade or so.
 
Yet while some see the speedway and all the development it’s attracted in Village West as a civic salvation, others are worried. Those investments in the future, along with a growing public debt unrelated to Village West, could soon eat the Unified Government alive, they say.
 
“We are in a real problem,”Unified Government Commissioner Butch Ellison said.“I don’t think that the payoff from the Village West is going to happen soon enough to bail us out.” 

 UNIFIED GOVERNMENT RESERVES 

 2006: $31.6 million
2007: $18.9 million
2008: $7.2 million
2009: $4.5 million
2010: $1.9 million

 Wednesday evening at Mission Theatre on Johnson Drive, the City of Mission, Kansas Community Development committee, Planning Commission, downtown Visioning Committee, the City Council, staff, maybe a half dozen Mission citizens and several other interested parties came together for City Administrator Michael Scanlon’s lecture regarding the Downtown Visioning Committee’s final report. 

 There were 17 members of the above commission, committees and council members seated in a horseshoe configuration. At least 2 members and the mayor were seated elsewhere, apparently not enough room at the table.

 More discussions, more committees, more public lectures and it would appear no real plans. Someone up front mention their finance background and then comment that they were concerned about using Tax Increment Financing (TIF) because it presented a risk to the city. REALLY? 

 Unless the City is stupid enough to guarantee the TIF obligations, they may not be accepting any risk.  And then there is the new and improved Johnson Drive Project which according to one Councilman, if the¼¢sales tax that’s going to the voters next month doesn’t pass, Johnson Drive Project can not be accomplished.

 Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) Senior Legal Counsel, Erik Stanley 

 Thanks for your call about whether we ever amended our complaint to add in residents and businesses of Mission. We did amend our complaint to add in a claim that the driveway tax was an unlawful excise tax and thus was void in its entirety. The outcome of that claim would have been that the entire driveway tax would have been stricken. But we never added in any additional plaintiffs to the case–the plaintiffs remained only the two churches in Mission. 

 The case is in the process of settlement right now by exempting churches so we are dropping our second claim regarding the excise tax in the settlement. 

 Sincerely, 

 Erik Stanley 

 ________________________________October 4th 2011_________________________________ 

 MISSION , Kan. — As part of a settlement of an Alliance Defense Fund lawsuit, the city of Mission voted Wednesday to exempt from its“driveway tax”churches and other entities who are exempt from property taxes under state law. ADF attorneys filed suit against the city on behalf of two churches in December of last year arguing that the city’s Transportation Utility Fee was, in reality, a tax from which churches should have been exempt. The suit sought a judicial determination that churches are exempt from the tax.

The odd tax, similar to ones struck down by supreme courts in two other states, bills property owners based on the number of trips in and out of their driveways. Because the city of Mission labeled the driveway tax a“fee,”it charged churches and other non-profit organizations ordinarily exempt from property taxes under state law. Read More 

 BREAKING ~ ADF Amends“Driveway Tax”Lawsuit 
 By the Shawnee Mission Times
 February 11th, 2011 
The Shawnee Mission Times has learned that the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF), the legal firm representing the Catholic and Baptist Church in Mission regarding the“Driveway Tax”lawsuit, has amended their lawsuit to also include all property owners in Mission affected by the Transportation Utility Fee (TUF). 

 Last year, the“Tax”was passed by the city council, despite protests from city businesses and residents. Fees generated by this TUF on property owners will be used to pay for street and road repair. The TUF was supported by Mayor Laura McConwell and was proposed by Mission City Administrator Mike Scanlon. 
 On Wednesday the Times interviewed ADF Senior Legal Counsel, Erik Stanley, and learned that ADF will submit their amendment to the court by February 11th. The city of Mission has already been notified of their intent. 
 Stanley indicated that the reason for the amendment is that it is ADF’s belief that the TUF is actually an excise tax and therefore illegal. The amended action does not affect the current claim regarding the TUF as it is implied to the churches’in Mission. 
 This is bad news to the city of Mission as the amended complaint is sure to spurn interests from outside groups to support the lawsuit with an Amicus, or Friend of the Court, brief. An Amicus brief allows other affected parties to become part of the lawsuit, which could include all property owners in Mission. 

 Question of the day is: Where does the&quot;amended&quot;lawsuit stand? 

 ________________________Worth Repeating: From October 5h, 2010 ____________________ 

 Tuesday, Oct. 5 Kansas City Star, Mission utility fee hurts residents 

Mission did not adequately think this“driveway tax”through when trying to cover budget expenditures. Since it is actually a fee and not a tax, residents cannot deduct it from state or federal income taxes. The real cost is much larger than advertised.

While businesses can deduct the fee as a cost of doing business, individuals can’t. Also, using the fee to replace some of the lowered property tax may result in some residents paying income taxes they would not have paid in the past.

Based on Mission’s philosophy for streets, the city should change all of the various funding items to user fees. For instance, that would mean complete support of the new walking trail by the users, or charging for the storm drainage system on the amount of runoff each site generates.

If the street program is a capital improvement program that envisions complete reconstruction of a street, it should be financed by a bond issue. Otherwise, it should be paid for as ongoing maintenance in the general budget. This fee appears to circumvent the voters in a bond issue to avoid raising the budget for maintenance.

 KCPL Lights Up Prairie Village with Free LED Lights 

 Shawnee Mission Times 

 As part of the next phase of KCP&amp;L’s LED Streetlight Pilot project, around 250 additional LED Streetlights will be installed throughout the city over the next six months. The installations will be done at no cost to the city. Prairie Village is one of the pilot sites for the program, which replaced several traditional high-pressure sodium streetlights with new LED models that are brighter and more energy efficient throughout the Kansas City area.

 In response to a KORA filed via email requesting a copy of the tape from last night that is usually recorded at council meetings, Mission’s City Clerk Martha Sumrall responded by email : 

 Bill, 

 In response to your request, there really isn&apos;t anything on the tape from last night&apos;s meeting. The meeting began at 7:00 p.m. with everyone present. Roll was called and the Pledge of Allegiance was recited. 

 Councilmember Shepard moved&quot;to adjourn to Executive Session to discuss current litigation involving the City of Mission. Attending the meeting will be City Administrator Mike Scanlon, City Attorney David Martin and City Land use Attorney Pete Heaven. Council will reconvene in Council Chambers at 7:18 p.m.&quot;Councilmember Kring seconded the motion and all voted AYE. 

 Council went into Executive Session at 7:03 p.m. and returned at 7:18 p.m. Councimember Andre moved to extend the Executive Session for an additional 10 minutes with the same people attending. This was seconded by Councilmember Shepard. Council again adjourned to Executive Session at 7:18 p.m. and reconvened at 7:28 p.m. 

 Councilmember Andre moved&quot;to adopt an ordinance amending Chapter 145 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Mission, Kansas, by adding a Section 145.071 relating to exemptions from the Transportation Utility Fee.&quot;The motion was seconded by Councilmember Vandenberg. All voted AYE. 

 Councilmember Kring stated that she would have liked to have additional time to consider this ordinance and its ramifications prior to the meeting. There were no other comments or discussion. 

 Councilmember Vandenberg moved to adjourn at 7:33 p.m. This was seconded by Councilmember Shepard. Council adjourned. 

 I hope this answers your questions about last night&apos;s meeting. 

 Thanks,

 Has the city of Mission Kansas violated the“Kansas Open Meeting Act”? 

 Tonight in a special City Council meeting which went into executive session; sources say the Mission City Council amended the“Transportation Utility Fee”(Driveway Tax) ordinance by exempting churches. According to sources the attorneys for the plaintive have agreed to drop the entire law suit which included all other property owners.  

 An hour after the executive session information is still sketchy; when Mayor Laura McConwell was asked how long this had been in the works, she would not respond other then saying she could not talk about it. The Mayor further stated that there will be a statement from the City of Mission Kansas offered in a day or two.  

 After being published the new revised ordinance should go into effect after approximately two weeks.

Don’t change county charter, Joco residents urge

By JOE LAMBE, The Kansas City Star

 The Johnson County Charter Commission on Tuesday night got an earful from residents blasting proposed changes to the county charter.
Speaker after speaker at the public hearing at the Sylvester Powell Community Center lambasted a list of proposals that include adding county commissioners, returning to partisan elections and allowing voters to repeal sales taxes.

 &gt;snip&lt; Yvonne Starks of Olathe supported partisan elections, however.“The people who vote for these people should know what they believe in,”she said. 
She also said the charter commission members have studied the county’s functioning and that other proposals might be beneficial. 
The crowd cried,“No, no, no.” Click here to read more 

________________________________________________________________________________________________

 September 26th 2011 

 Earlier in the year my office did some research to determine the amount of vacant, for lease or for sale space along Johnson Drive. This study focused on the area between Metcalf and Nall and one block to the north and south of Johnson Drive. It was determined that there was approximately One Hundred Fifty Thousand square feet (150,000 sq. ft.) of space that is vacant and/or for sale or lease in this area. Having lived in the metro area since 1976 it is my belief that this amount of vacant space has never existed in Mission, at any time in the past. While there is new retail development going on and some businesses moving into the area, the broad range of vacant space remains a troubling situation.
 
I continue to get questions from prospective tenants and buyers about the&quot;Driveway Tax&quot;and how it will impact their businesses. Fortunately, the impact is comparatively minor for many business types but people still remember the Kansas City Star newspaper article that implied that each business would be getting an annual $3500 driveway tax bill. If City Hall would have taken the time to prepare a press release with accurate examples of how the Transportation Utility Fee (a/k/a Driveway Tax) was going to impact various existing business owners the story would have never&quot;taken off&quot;the way it did.
In my opinion if downtown Mission dries up and blows away, it will negatively impact everyone that has anything to do with the city.....whether they are home owners, business owners, and commercial property owners or if they simply enjoy visiting and shopping at small, locally owned stores. It is unbelievable that more people aren&apos;t pressing the City for assistance in stimulating activity in the downtown area so that the remaining local merchants don&apos;t close their doors. Economic times are&quot;tough&quot;but other metro area communities pull together to stimulate activity for their area merchants through the creation of fun events that attract people to the area. For example, take a look at what Waldo does http://www.waldokc.org/ on the Missouri side and what Overland Park is doing  http://downtownop.org/ 

 Some years ago the Arts&amp;Eats Festival was moved from Johnson Drive to the parking lot around the Sylvester Powell Community Center. Now the event does little that I can see which actually benefits downtown business owners. When the event was held on Johnson Drive I had business owners tell me that they experienced some of their&quot;best ever&quot;days in terms of retail sales....no more. This year I was told that the event seemed to draw more big businesses renting booth space (I believe it is $175 or $200) and fewer small businesses and artists. Perhaps the City feels that the event is easier to run in the community center parking lot or maybe they view it as a way to boost membership, at what I understand is a community center operating in the RED but, in my opinion the event is being held in the wrong location. 

 Early next year four (4) City Council Seats come up for election. The last time around these 4 individuals ran unopposed and got elected with as few as: 43; 51; 64; and 116 votes. This level of voter turn should be an embarrassment to the residents of these Wards. I&apos;m not saying that all these council members should be voted out since I haven&apos;t personally looked at their individual voting records. However, there should be more public discussion of the issues with area voters. If some opposition candidates would step forward, register to run and start making their voices heard on the important issues, I think they would help the public become better informed and to be elected a candidate would actually have to take a stand on the issues.
 
My understanding is that two candidates have already registered to run against incumbents. If you know these people and put me in contact with them, I&apos;m thinking that I might like to allow them to voice their opinions on a few local issues in the 4th Quarter Edition of my company&apos;s Newsletter. Perhaps I could even figure out how to organize a public debate between the candidates.

 Gardner Begins Administrator Search Anew - Final Candidates Withdraw 

Peter Solie
GardnerEDGE

 Mayor David Drovetta issued the following statement regarding the City of Gardner&apos;s search for a new City Administrator: 

  From the Office of the Mayor. 

  I have decided to place the City Administrator search on hold. I will recommend to the Council that we enlist the services of Michael Press, former Johnson County Manager, to serve as our Interim City Administrator, to assist us with our workload and to provide us with much needed guidance. 

  I have made this decision since the two top candidates for the position have withdrawn their applications due to the actions of a Councilmember and delays in decisions. 

 &gt;snip&lt;Based on the process agreed to by the City Council, candidates for the position were told that their interest would be held in confidence and they would be informed well in advance of making their names public. This assurance of confidentiality was broken, forcing the candidates to notify their organizations and governing bodies sooner than necessary and without adequate time to prepare.

This breach came to light when a candidate was contacted by an individual who writes about that community on a website. The individual referred to information that was only discussed in executive session. This violation of confidentiality by the Councilmember not only negatively impacted the reputation of our community but also placed us at risk for civil action. Later a Councilmember began to run their own background check of a candidate without notifying the candidate, city staff, or the Governing Body. This action was unethical, unprofessional and again placed our community at risk. Read More

 Changes to Johnson County Charter are debated 
 
 By JOE LAMBE 
The Kansas City Star 

 The Johnson County Charter Commission on Monday debated proposed changes to the county charter, including adding two county commissioners, returning to partisan elections and letting voters repeal sales taxes and remove city managers.
 
The commission wants to hear the public’s thoughts on possible changes at a meeting Sept. 27. (Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center, Mission Kansas at 7:00PM) . 

 The commission, which convenes every 10 years, will make recommendations for the 2012 election. It also could recommend changes in county and state government. 

 &gt;snip&lt;  He also proposed allowing voter initiatives to recall elected and appointed officials, including managers, in the county as well as any city, commission, board, district or agency 

 &gt;snip&lt;  also suggested letting voters in the county or any city within it vote every two years on whether to retain any local-option sales taxes. Another of his suggestions would allow voter initiatives to roll back any real estate property tax imposed by the county or any other entity that collects taxes through the county’s tax bill.

 Councilman Fotovich frustrated by search progress   

 

 Larry Fotovitch Gardner city councilman 
 
 One of my earliest duties as a newly elected council member
 was to list the qualities I valued in our next 

 city administrator, so our
 recruiter could begin his search. 

 I provided my input, but based on the selection process I’ve
 observed so far, if the best man wins, it will be by sheer luck. 

 Even on that first night, as we were advised by our
 recruiter that we should consider raising our salary range, I knew something
 was up.    Fortunately, one council member
 asked our human resource manager to provide a salary comparison of
 similar-sized cities, and at a later meeting, we all agreed that the salary the
 city of Gardner was offering was competitive. 

 In June, however, the question came up again.   This time, Mayor Drovetta sent each council member an e-mail asking us if we would be willing to increase
 our salary range for a“very experienced”candidate who would consider a
 lateral move for an“opportunity for growth in Gardner.” 

 I declined to answer, but I learned that only one other
 council member did not approve his request. Read the: Rest of the story

 Is the Mission City Administrator on the Move?
By Currie Myers, Publisher Shawnee Mission Times 
 August 18th, 2011 

 

 City Administrator, Mike Scanlon, may be looking for greener pastures after nearly 8 years at the helm in Mission. Scanlon, the city administrator of Mission and the former city administrator of Merriam is rumored to be in the running for the city administrator’s job in Gardner, Kansas. Scanlon is known across the U.S. as the visionary behind the so-called“Driveway Tax.” 

 The Times contacted Scanlon about the rumor that he has applied for the top job in Gardner, but Scanlon would not return the email inquiry. 

 Prior to last night’s Mission Kansas city council meeting, Mike Scanlon City Administrator was asked if it were true that he was in the top three candidates for the Gardner Kansas City Administrator position. Scanlon said that he didn’t know if he was in the top three but did acknowledge he was in fact applying for the position.

 The&quot;Sustainability Commission&quot;is a farce, and a waste of city funds, since the whole&quot;Sustainable Community&quot;mantra is a proclamation under false pretenses. It is bureaucracy created to oversee something that doesn&apos;t exist... The fear mongering of this hoax, for profit and loss of property rights, is all predicated on the declaration of anthropogenic global warming....anthropogenic meaning human activity induced. And the global warming alarmists have been proven to be wrong. Falsified data records have been exposed. Even the hypocrite Al Gore has been admitting defeat lately: 

Most of all, common sense and experience tells us that we are just guests on this planet.....the only one in control is God. How pompous it is to think that humans have a say in how planet Earth operates? Do people honestly think that money (carbon taxes) can tame the planet? Come on man! Last time I looked, volcanoes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and asteroids don&apos;t come with an on/off switch or deposit box. We&apos;re along for the ride......

Global warming, or, since that doesn&apos;t work anymore, Climate Change, is a scam...a deception. And we&apos;re part of it, whether we like it or not. Our city&apos;s future has been planned around it. It&apos;s all over the city&apos;s website....and all over the city: All the diet road projects (lane reduction), the landing strip sidewalks, the manufactured swamps, the big ugly unnatural tree signs.....the entire P3 People Planet Prosperity dog and pony show is misguided, and has no scientific basis. It is corruption at its finest. Don&apos;t believe me? Do the research. Like any form of corruption, to find the source, follow the money. Where does the Sustainable Community movement come from? The United Nations, specifically it&apos;s Agenda 21. We are all content to let a global group from afar govern our lives? There is not one leader in the UN that was elected by the people.....not one. And we are to follow their direction? Come on man! This is the same UN that is murdering scores of innocent civilians in Libya, and around the world, under the pretense of&quot;peacekeeping&quot;.

Here&apos;s another good one: they don&apos;t have enough money for road maintenance, since they spent it on unnecessary&quot;Sustainable Community&quot;stuff, so they install a cockamamie disguised property tax, and then proudly proclaim (big yellow dictator signs) that they&apos;re really doing something?

 Area cities’austerity measures‘run the gamut’ 

By MATT PEARCE
 The Kansas City Star

(Please Note; no mention of the City of Mission Kansas)

 Roeland Park employees carpool more now.
 
For conferences, they’ll also split hotel rooms with staff from other cities. Soon, the city could be sharing garbage services and specialized equipment with its neighbors—anything to save a buck in a city that didn’t have money to trim trees in 2011.
 
“You’re trying to stretch dollars, bottom line,”Roeland Park City Administrator Aaron Otto said.
 
And Roeland Park is hardly alone. While Johnson County’s cities remain among the most prosperous in the region, a grueling economic slowdown—now entering its fourth year—has introduced a new era of austerity for some local decision-makers, leading to tax hikes, slashed services and some unusual cost-cutting measures.

 The
City of Mission Kansas will have their public hearing on the 2012 budget this
week on Wednesday at 6:30 at City Hall. I don&apos;t think
they have put out a detailed budget, yet. They have been talking at recent
meetings about having to limit General Fund spending to $9.5 million for 2012. However, it appears that the budget they will
send to the County for property taxes will be $10.3 million. That will act as a
cap on the budget. They will probably pass a budget resolution perhaps at the same
meeting telling staff to find things they can cut. The actual final budget is
probably a couple of months away. However, the meeting on Wednesday may be the
only time the public can comment. 

 Additionally, there is work going on to put two quarter cent sales taxes on the ballot for later this year. The first is for transportation funding. City staff has been authorized to draft language for the transportation increase. As part of that Mike Scanlon suggested at a City Council work session on 7/27, that they add rebating $300,000 of TUF if the sales tax passes. He now thinks that the City only needs $1.25 million a year now for roads, instead of the original $1.5 million that was calculated for the TUF. The City Council was agitated by this discussion. They need to have the wording for the ballot done by September 7th. You may remember that citizens told them at meetings last they could have a sales tax or the TUF, but not both. They would appear to ignoring that.

Also, at the budget meeting on Tuesday they indicated that TUF can pay for the Nall project... I don&apos;t know how that squares with the rebate above. I don&apos;t recall Nall being on the TUF repair schedule, but I haven&apos;t looked.

The City Council discussed closing the outdoor pool in an effort to balance the budget. In response last month, the Mayor assembled a task force to study the pool. They are working quickly to come up with a recommendation by the same September 7th deadline. The recommendation will probably ask for a quarter cent sales tax to build a new pool and provide for community center maintenance.

More cities feel pressed to adopt property tax hikes

By Loren Stanton

Johnson County Sun Newspapers

Johnson County cities largely have balanced budgets during the recession by cutting costs rather than raising taxes, but that likely will change for three communities next year.

 Overland Park, Lenexa and Prairie Village all are considering property tax hikes to support their 2012 budgets. 

 The moves are being made in part to keep from getting farther behind on street maintenance projects and to avoid personnel losses. The slight boost of six-tenths of a mill in Prairie Village is for hiring two police officers. Most cities around the county have been making cuts in projects, services and staff for the last several years in order survive revenue shortfalls. With retail activity slowed, sales tax revenues are lagging, and with property valuations declining so are property tax collections. 

 Cities will be holding public hearings and casting final votes on their spending plans over the next several weeks, but only minor adjustments usually are made in these final stages of budget development. Following are 2012 budget highlights from the county’s six largest cities. 

 OVERLAND PARK The City Council voted unanimously last week to move forward with a budget containing a 4.1-mill increase in the property tax rate. During the recession, the city has avoided tax increases by making significant cutbacks in personnel and by deferring maintenance on streets. But council members are choosing higher taxes over even greater austerity out of concern that further cuts could be detrimental to quality of life and long-term interests of the city.

 2012 Budget Seminars 
 scheduled for June 20th&amp;June 21stat the Sylvester Powell, Jr. Community Center 
 6200 Martway 7:00 - 8:00 p.m 

Our Annual Budget is a process that starts in March with an update to our Five-Year Financial Forecast. The forecast helps create the framework for future budget decisions by trying to estimate our financial condition over the next five years. The forecast is produced for our General Fund only. The General Fund is where we pay for all of our operating costs, including Parks&amp;Recreation, Police, and Public Works. Debt Service and Infrastructure costs come from other funds.

 2011 Five-Year Financial Forecast Assumptions 

 Revenues: There will be no growth in revenues for the next five years, and in the base year (2012) we’ve reduced our starting revenue collections by an additional 5% to account for the continued decline in property values and sales tax collections. There has been no change in base rates or fee charges during the entire forecast period.

 Expenditures: We have capped annual growth in all expense categories at 2% with the exception of Capital Outlay, which we expect to grow at a higher rate (7.5%). We did this to account for the liabilities we’ve created by not replacing our fleet and equipment in the last two years, which will in turn force a higher cost in the future. We will need to continue contributions to our debt service and capital improvement funds to meet our debt and capital improvement objectives.

 Forecast Results: Without improvement in revenue collections, the City needs to identify at least $650,000 in annual savings starting in 2012 in order to balance our General Fund budget over the next five years. State Law requires a balanced budget, so we cannot kick the can (problem) down the road.

 2008 -- 2010 Actuals and Budget 2011 

If you look at the City’s actual audited General Fund expenses since 2008, they have remained flat every year with the exception of 2011 where we cut them by about 3%. Understand that in those flat periods we have been internalizing any inflationary costs by either reducing expenses or passing increase health insurance costs on to our employees. We will need to decrease our budget even more in 2012 to meet the forecasted revenue numbers. Given that most of our budget is made up of people costs this is likely going to require a further reduction in the number of employees we have.

 Does Mission need yet another fast food restaurant? 
Across the street (south west) of Johnny’s Hickory House BBQ will raise a Culver’s Restaurant in what was approved by the city to be“multi-tenant retail building”.   

 &quot;Mission Crossing Project
The Mission Crossing developers have submitted revised site plans for review
showing the conversion of the northern most building along Metcalf from a multi-tenant
retail building to a Culver’s Restaurant. The proposed Culver’s building would be
approximately 4,200 square feet in size. Architectural changes to the remaining retail
building are also included in the proposal.&quot; 

Things you might remember for later on: Additional traffic in and out?  TIF! Another fast food restaurant being built now on Johnson Drive next to Taco Bell, west of McDonalds.  TIF! As far as the city is concerned; who knew it would not be as planned and when did they find out?

&gt;snip&lt; This is the kind of sprawl that (sorry, suburbanites) costs taxpayers a boatload of money as they build new schools, roads, sewers and water lines and provide lots of services such as public safety. And don’t forget the public money it costs to maintain all those streets, schools, sewers, etc., in the future.

 Mission ’s Driveway Tax Fodder for Roeland Park Race

Millett favors monitoring expenses and keeping spending in check to avoid a tax increase. Millett said that the City Council should put more emphasis on attracting new businesses to Roeland Park to increase sales and property tax income.“Mission’s driveway tax could drive a lot of businesses away and Roeland Park should take advantage of that,”he said.

 Nall Avenue Improvements 
      (From Mission’s website) 

 The City of Mission has awarded a construction contract to Miles Excavating Inc. for completion of the Nall Avenue Rehabilitation Project (67th Street to Martway Street). Construction will be underway soon. All streets will be open to local traffic only during the majority of construction work.  

 Click here for information on Preliminary Construction Schedule and history of the deconstruction of Nall Avenue Mission Kansas. 

 The Nall Avenue Rehabilitation Project was originally a Johnson County CARS project slated for 2011. Because the City of Shawnee has had to suspend CARS projects due to budget constraints, Mission was awarded CARS funds to move forward with the Nall project in 2010. The project’s main goal includes replacement of curbs and pavement, which are in poor condition . The City’s street condition inventory of 2008 found segments of Nall Avenue to be among the worst road segments in Mission 
 GIVE ME A BREAK! 

 Planned Improvements 

 The improvement concept provides a Nall Avenue Trail of one-mile in length. This trail will connect with the Rock Creek Trail in Mission and allow for safer bicycle and pedestrian crossing of Shawnee Mission Parkway .  Want to tell me how that’s going to work? Elevated bike path over Shawnee Mission Parkway? Tunnel? Or, the seldom used“improvement”users will be beamed up from one side of the parkway and deposited on the other by the orbiting space ship that apparently beamed most of the city’s conspirators to earth?  Click here to view a short video of Nall Avenue.

Independence pays $3.5 million for debt-service payment for Bass Pro retail site

By BRIAN BURNES–The Kansas City Star

 Tax revenues generated by a development anchored by a Bass Pro Shops store have lagged expectations so severely that Independence now must make a huge debt-service payment.
City leaders voted Tuesday to cover the $3.5 million payment on bonds sold to finance the development.
The city has asked the development group, Crackerneck Creek LLC, to reimburse it for the amount.
The developers, in a letter delivered this week, said they were unable to do that.

Mixed-use project takes shape at former yearbook plant in Mission

 Mission officials said Monday that Lane4 Property Group applied for the demolition permit late last week.

Regarding the second story below dated yesterday.

 Just a couple of points. While the debt is now $31.2 million that is not the same thing as being in the hole by that amount. The money was used to invest in infrastructure. There are additional assets on the City&apos;s books that have a value greater than the debt. I have not heard anyone debate that they have repaired and I guess fixed the Stormwater system. If that is so, they do get some credit (no pun intended) for that.

 Aquarium to Locate at Crown Center 

February 9, 2011

 Kansas City will get an aquarium in 2012.
The much discussed, but never acted upon aquarium will be located in much of the building that now houses the Halls department store.
Crown Center and a British based company, Merlin Entertainments will operate a $15 million dollar aquarium under the SEA LIFE aquarium brand. A news release says,”The deal is signed and unconditional, and will not receive any tax incentives.”
“We are exited to bring this great attraction to our city”, said Bill Lucas of Crown Center.
Crown Center says moving the Hall department store will be relatively easy because most a department store’s space is a big box.
SEA LIFE plans to develop an aquarium exhibit featuring aquatic life from the Missouri River, floating to the Mississippi River, to the Gulf and then the Atlantic.
SEA LIFE claims to be the world’s biggest aquarium brand with 30 facilities attracting 8 .million visitor a year. The Kansas City aquarium will present a 2-3 hour aquatic tour.
 There has been talk of developing an aquarium for Kansas City for decades. Past potential locations included the river front, Union Station and lately, the demolished site of the old Mission Mall. SEA LIFE says Kansas City had several elements in its favor. 
One was the lack of any regional competition for an aquarium for at least 200 miles.
The company also like the financial power of Crown Center. A third factor they says the attractive demographics for a family- themed attraction.

 Mayor Laura McConwell first
 says yes and then no to Fox News 

 

 

 The law firm representing
 the Catholic&amp;Baptist churches against the
 City of Mission (The Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) regarding‘The Driveway Tax’has amended the lawsuit to include businesses&amp;residences. 

   

 According to reports, Fox
 News National picked up the story&amp;was ready to fly someone out from New York to interview
 the Mayor.   Apparently, she agreed and
 then declined the interview.   As we
 understand it; Fox News plans on airing Mission ’s story February 10, 2011 . 

   

 It would seem; Fox News
 interest lies with the issue of churches being taxed and not necessarily on the
 amended information which includes the rest of the so called“ Transportation Utility Fee ”.   

   

 “The object in structuring a TUF,
 therefore, is to make it as much like a user fee and as little like a tax as
 possible. A TUF imposed by Fort Collins , Colorado , was upheld by
 the supreme court of that state when it was determined to be a valid fee. The
 Supreme Court of Idaho struck down Pocatello &apos;s TUF when it
 was held to be a disguised tax”   

 

 Interesting!  
 There does not appear to be a first amendment issue here but another question begs for an answer? Why does an extremely well paid City Administrator have to use his valuable time monitoring the social networks and the little town of Mission Kansas’s“official website&quot;?  ( See below from working copy) Link to full: Document

Truth Emerging on Unencumbered K-12 Education Funds
By Paul Soutar on December 27, 2010

 What could Kansas do with an extra $743 million? That’s a question legislators and the governor-elect want answered.
Kansas K-12 schools had $1.567 billion in unencumbered or carryover cash on July 1 and as much as $743 million of it could be made available for discretionary spending by school districts, according to state government research. 

 Those numbers, released in November, came as a surprise to legislators who were told in April, during final 2011 budget deliberations, that schools’carryover balances would be $1.156 billion, $411 million lower than they actually were on July 

 Republican leaders in Topeka want to put some of the carryover money to use. Link to rest of the story.

Johnson County District Court Receives Lawsuit Against City of Mission Kansas

 When asked for an interview regarding the lawsuit, Mike Scanlon City Adminstrator replyed;&quot;We don&apos;t discuss lawsuits&quot; 

Author Erik Stanley - ADF Senior Legal Counsel 

ADF filed a lawsuit against the City of Mission, Kansas, after the City instituted a“driveway tax”and applied it to churches and other non-profits. The“driveway tax”charges property owners within the City of Mission an amount that is calculated based on the number of trips in and out of their driveways. As bizarre as it sounds, churches are taxed for 5.8 trips per week per seat in their sanctuaries. The people of Mission, Kansas, therefore, are paying a tax every time they go to church.

The City of Mission calls this charge a“Transportation Utility Fee,”and the monies raised are ostensibly earmarked to repair the City’s streets. But this is not a“fee”at all. Rather, the charge is a property tax in disguise. And this new and unique property tax conflicts directly with the Kansas state law that exempts churches, non-profits and charities from property taxes. The City of Mission cannot institute a new property tax on churches and non-profits when the State has already declared these organizations exempt from property taxes. Read More

 WHAT A WASTE AND A DAMNED, DAMNED SHAME! 
Where does the shame lie? City of Mission? City of Overland Park? Johnson County? State of Kansas? Maybe but in the end it’s you and me, citizens of Mission for allowing our elected officials the luxury of no oversight by the electorate.

 Next month the‘old Capital Federal Building’5251 Johnson Drive is scheduled to be demolished in order to build a ‘bus stop” and then give it to Johnson County. The demolition is costing over 86,000 Mission dollars.

 WASHINGTON—Cities’revenues will plunge sharply as property taxes, in their first year of recession-impacted reassessments, get set to decline deeply in 2011. Local government fiscal shortfalls may total $83 billion, which the League of Cities estimates may force up to 500,000 staff reductions. Basic city services will shrink. Infrastructure projects will get cancelled or postponed. 

 These are hard times for America’s local governments. Economists may declare the Great Recession is“over,”but localities see a different picture. The federal stimulus monies that helped so many of them balance their budgets runs out December 31. So does Washington’s two-year old“Build America”bond program, which has made local infrastructure borrowing more affordable. 

 Plus, as yet another season of compounded budget cuts dawns, cities must also struggle with unrelenting increases in health care costs. Many also face a fearsome debt overhang of heavy pension obligations.

 A Letter to Mission&apos;s City Adminstrator Mr. Scanlon 

 It has come to my attention that you have stated you received 5 or 6 calls from residents with complaints alleging the tactic of bullying by those who were handing out flyers for the cause of repealing your inappropriate driveway tax. I understand you made that statement to my friend Steve Schowengerdt. To qualify, did you say that? If so, I would like you to reveal the details of those said calls. Who are the residents who state that they were bullied? What did they say? Did they state that they were&quot;bullied&quot;, or did you subjectively affix that label ? Read The Rest

 The Johnson County Sun 

 Some of the policies of the Johnson County Commission are antiquated. 
 The county collects the County Assistance Roads System (CARS) money and distributes it to the cities. The commission needs to have a Master Plan showing which roads are considered county thoroughfares, collector streets and residential streets. As it has been explained to me, CARS funds were generally set up to help develop the county road system. Some cities are using this money to make two-lane roads out of four-lane roads.

Debbie Kring is a Councilwoman from the City of Mission Kansas. She apparently is taking a citizen who is cirulating a petition critizing the adminstration for it’s excess spending to task. The following is from Face Book.

 Debbie Kring Dave......please tread lightly when combining church with state activities. Your petition activities should not be conducted on church property. I will be at St. Pius on Saturday and Sunday.........hope to see you there :-) Link to: Dave&apos;s Face Book page.

Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.......simply amazing. That&apos;s like abandoning your car just because it ran out of gas, and getting a new one.

This information is available to the public, but really isn&apos;t well known public information. The more residents, and non-residents, know about this, and the other cockamamie brain challenged ideas of this administration, the better. We need to get the public media involved. Channel 5 is right down the street. It&apos;s just like exposing the man behind the curtain as the real Oz.....heck, Toto figured that one out.  Read more of Mike Galvin&apos;s letter. 

 

 

 Tuesday, Oct. 5 Kansas City Star, Mission utility fee hurts residents 

Mission did not adequately think this“driveway tax”through when trying to cover budget expenditures. Since it is actually a fee and not a tax, residents cannot deduct it from state or federal income taxes. The real cost is much larger than advertised.

While businesses can deduct the fee as a cost of doing business, individuals can’t. Also, using the fee to replace some of the lowered property tax may result in some residents paying income taxes they would not have paid in the past.

Based on Mission’s philosophy for streets, the city should change all of the various funding items to user fees. For instance, that would mean complete support of the new walking trail by the users, or charging for the storm drainage system on the amount of runoff each site generates.

If the street program is a capital improvement program that envisions complete reconstruction of a street, it should be financed by a bond issue. Otherwise, it should be paid for as ongoing maintenance in the general budget. This fee appears to circumvent the voters in a bond issue to avoid raising the budget for maintenance.

 On August 25th 2010, Mission&apos;s City Administrator Mike Scanlan suggested that a committee whose members were appointed by Mayor Laura McConwell be dissolved when confronted with strenuous objections to the (so called) Driveway Tax 

(From Minutes of the Mission Downtown Visioning Committee August 25, 2010)

&quot;Mr. Scanlon asked if maybe it is time to dissolve the Downtown Visioning Committee (DVC). Mr. Scanlon stated if the rest of the Committee feels as Dave does, then spending any money would be counter intuitive to Dave&apos;s argument. Mr. Scanlon stated that the time for this Committee may be when there are better economic times.

The Committee disagreed with Mr. Scanlon&apos;s assessment, suggested that investing in the Downtown District is important, that the committee needs to continue, and the City needs to look at what they can do to invest in Johnson Drive.&quot;

 What is a Transportation Utility Fee (TUF)? 

 Although sometimes referred to as a driveway tax, the TUF does not have
anything to do with driveways (or
parking lot size), nor is it a tax . The TUF is a user fee , assessed through property tax bills. 

 Why do we have a Transportation Utility Fee? 

 David Harvey, (unsuccessful candidate for the Kansas State Senate District 7) stated that a female mayor in the 7th District told him that residents do not like taxes but will pay fees. You can find Mr. Harvey’s video Link To:Video ; five minutes into the remarks he speaks of the mayor,“her”, you can judge for yourself who“she”might be
