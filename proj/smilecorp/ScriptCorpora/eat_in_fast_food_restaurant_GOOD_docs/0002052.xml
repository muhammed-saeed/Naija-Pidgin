Summer best trip review: Anaheim Disney. Although gas prices have settled in the pocket of consumers, economy is above average,people are back taking the long trips to the mountains, to the river, and the beach. But Anaheim Disney 9:30 PM is in the top ten places to visit for the sound and the sparks in the blue sky. You see people parked and out with their beach chairs sitting enjoying their favorite refreshements await the Disney fireworks. It seems if the 4th July last the longest among all the annual holidays.

 ================================
This used to be a Spires Restaurant back in the early eighties. It was a fun place to work, located behind my girlfriend Robin Peterson housing track off the other side from Hill St. It was a hope after the bar closed at 2:00 Am. The ownwer John Herataki or we nick name Mr.H is a Greek who is also related to the Heratakis in my old native town (Mina) Lebanon. John overexpanded his restaurant chain and begin to sell with good faith to some members of his church to give back to his community, That was at first two partner who purchased this location, Frank and Pete, both greeks also, it a month and ended upin court for who will be at the helm.

Pete was a district manager for the old Sambos restaurant chain and settled his disagreement in court for money where he went and purchased a different location of Spires restaurant also in Fullerton on Imperial Highway and Harbor Blvd near the Chevron Gas Station where it was called&quot;Pepper Shakers&quot; i became a patron because i lived with a mile. Salt and Pepper continue to serve the Continental menu of american food from the old Spires with updeted ingridients and packaging.

A Widower Hits The Dating Scene.
 so they do, but who can blame them? Edward is a catch—or will be, once he’s returned from the Underworld. A 62-year-old teacher, he’s a“Science Guy. Erudite and kind, balding but handsome,”according to the personal ad placed, unbeknown to him, by his stepdaughter and stepdaughter-in-law in The New York Review of Books. Despite his horror at this gesture, he cares for Bee’s children, and for the other survivors she has bequeathed him: a failing 15-year-old dog and an ancient mother-in-law who calls herself“the wreck of the Hesperus”but hasn’t lost a marble yet—indeed, wishes she could forget,“just a little,”to mitigate her own grief
