Arizona&apos;s tough new law against illegal immigrants has re-energized the debate over badly needed reforms to an immigration and border system widely seen as broken, but the political climate makes it unlikely that Congress will take up the issue this year. Below, the Tribune explores the issues, myths and on-the-street realities behind the national debate.

 Joel Stein: My taco with Tancredo 

I never thought GOP presidential candidate Tom Tancredo would eat Mexican food with me.

Only surprising.
