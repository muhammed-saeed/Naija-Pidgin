No mention of tuna was made in the announcement but it did say that many of the ill people had eaten sushi, sashimi, or similar foods.

 April 6, 2012 : CDC posted an update on the outbreak stating that 100 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia had been sickened with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Bareilly.

 April 9, 2012: Preliminary results of restaurant comparison study from 4 restaurants show that the proportion of comparison sushi orders containing spicy tuna as an ingredient averaged 37% (ranging from 29% to 53%).

 Tempeh Salmonella Lawsuit and Recall 
 Posted on June 18, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
The tempeh  Salmonella recall associated with a large outbreak of salmonellosis in North Carolina and other states totaled 5,181 pounds of soy and non-soy tempeh products distributed by Smiling Hara Tempeh LLC of Candler, North Carolina.

 The contamination was discovered in April by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture during a routine inspection. Through scientific investigation, the exact same strain of Salmonella paratyphi B found in the meat substitute also was confirmed to be in 88 people. The food product was distributed in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida . Many of the case patients lived in or visited the Asheville area and greater Buncombe County, where the outbreak was centered. Many restaurants, delis and food carts carried the product.

Further investigation confirmed that the starter culture used by Smiling Hara in its tempeh products was positive for Salmonella . The culture used by the company was imported by a Maryland firm from Indonesia.

The clear findings in this outbreak have provided the basis for a tempeh lawsuit to compensate victims who were sickened by a human pathogen that had no business being in the food they ate. This food poisoning outbreak was preventable and the companies that stood to profit from the sales will be held responsible for the harm that resulted. Salmonella paratyphi B can cause paratyphoid fever and its associated complications, including meningitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Reiter’s syndrome (arthritis), secondary infections of the heart and other organs, and other serious health problems. Even if your illness did not land you in a hospital, you could still receive substantial compensation by joining the litigation.

PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is one of the few law firms in the United States practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and our clients have won millions to compensate them for medical expenses, lost time at work, travel costs, pain and suffering and future considerations.

 Diamond Pet Food Outbreak Expands 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
The human Salmonella outbreak linked to handling contaminated dog food or having contact with a pet who has eaten the product started in October 2011 and has continued to make people sick. In the past month, for instance, five more case patients have been identified in Alabama (1), California (1), Illinois (1), New York (1), and South Carolina (1). 

Including two related illnesses in Canada, state and national public health agencies have identified 22 people who were infected with one of the two strains of Salmonella associated with this outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the spread of poisoning with molecular tracing and Michigan authorities were the first to find  Salmonella in an unopened bag of Diamond Naturals Lamb Meal&amp;Rice dry dog food, which had been collected March 14 during routine testing of dry pet food.

 Salmonella lawyers for PritzkerOlsen, P.A., have filed a dog food lawsuit against Diamond Pet Food and Costco, the national discount retailer that recalled certain Kirkland brand varieties of dog food made by Diamond at a plant in Gaston, South Carolina. FDA inspectors found food safety issues at the plant.

The Diamond Pet Food suit is filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey on behalf of a baby who contracted Salmonellosis through no fault of her family. Once introduced into the home environment, the Salmonella bacteria is easily transferred by contact and can quickly spread throughout the environment. The bacteria is colorless, odorless and the infectious dose, especially for children, is extremely small. The child was hospitalized and has been successfully treated.

The Salmonella lawsuit by PritzkerOlsen is active and was the first legal action brought on behalf of victims of this outbreak. A total of six confirmed case patients in this outbreak were hospitalized. But even if your illness was not life threatening, you could still receive substantial compensation from the companies responsible for this outbreak.

 Mt. Healthy Hatcheries Tied to Salmonella 
 Posted on June 2, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella lawyer Fred Pritzker is calling on Mt. Healthy Hatcheries of Mt. Healthy, Ohio, to pay all medical bills, lost wages and other immediate costs incurred by victims of the chicks and ducklings Salmonella outbreak that has hit across the eastern half the United States.

 State public health officials, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the USDA&apos;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) and Veterinary Services are investigating the outbreak. They have not publicly identified the mail-order hatchery that is making people sick, but Mt. Healthy issued a statement acknowledging that it is at the center of the investigation and that it is cooperating with authorities.

“Clearly, any time there is a death or illnesses, it is tragic, and we share the public’s concern,&apos;&apos; Mt. Healthy said in a statement.

One person may have died as a result of this outbreak, which began March 1. Eighteen people have been hospitalized and a total of 93 people in 23 states have been confirmed as case patients. Even if your illness was not life threatening, you could still receive substantial compensation from the companies responsible . If Mt. Healthy does the right thing by paying for the immediate costs, additional compensation for pain and suffering, future medical expenses and other future harms could be settled later in a proper claims forum or Salmonella lawsuit.

You can obtain help by sending contact information online or by calling the law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Our firm represents outbreak victims and is one of the few legal teams in the U.S. practicing extensively in foodborne illness litigation, a complicated area of law.

Salmonellosis should not be taken lightly.  Salmonella is a bacterial pathogen that causes diarrhea and fever but can also result in  Salmonella -induced chronic conditions such as aseptic reactive arthritis and Reiter‘s syndrome (a combination of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis).  Salmonella symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal, diarrhea, fever, and headache. These acute symptoms may last for 1 or 2 days or may be prolonged depending on virulence factors. Salmonella is especially dangerous for infants, the elderly, and people with HIV or in treatment for cancer. People who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor.

 Ohio Salmonella Outbreak Traced to Poultry From Mail-Order Hatchery 
 Posted on May 31, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

An Ohio Salmonella outbreak has been traced to the same hatchery for live chicks and ducklings that was associated with many cases of salmonellosis last year. Tragically in this year&apos;s outbreak, public health investigators suspect one death.

 New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and many other states east of the Mississippi River also have infections of Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Newport and Salmonella Lille that are part of this outbreak and the CDC is warning consumers once again to wash hands thoroughly after handling live poultry or any part of the environment where they live. If children are involved, adults should supervise their hand-washing to make sure it&apos;s thorough.

The mail-order chicks and ducklings from the Ohio hatchery are used as pets or for backyard flocks to raise eggs or meat. The hatchery linked to the past two outbreaks was not named in the official CDC warning, but it was visited by state veterinarians last month and recommendations were made for improvements, the CDC said.

 National food poisoning law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.,can help victims of this outbreak recover claims money to pay for medical bills, lost time at work, travel costs and other harms. Of the 93 confirmed illnesses in 23 states, 18 of the victims have been hospitalized.No information has been release about the suspected Salmonella death . 

Mail-order hatcheries, agricultural feed stores, and others that sell or display chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry should provide health-related information to owners and potential purchasers of these birds prior to the point of purchase. This should include information about the risk of acquiring a Salmonella infection from contact with live poultry. But even when these warnings are carried out, they don&apos;t nullify claims from those who have fallen ill from the contamination.

PritzkerOlsen has collected millions for Salmonella outbreak victims and currently represents people in Salmonella lawsuits, including one filed this week in New Jersey related to an infant getting seriously sick from coming into contact with dog food that carried the pathogen. For a free Salmonella case evaluation, leave your contact information or call our firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). A lawyer will answer your questions and explain how you pay nothing until your case is won.

 Salmonella Tempeh Outbreak Traced to Ingredient Maker From Indonesia 
 Posted on May 24, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

The Salmonella tempeh outbreak linked to North Carolina&apos;s Smiling Hara Tempeh company has been traced all the way to Indonesia where contaminated tempeh starter culture was made and distributed all around the world.

 Food Poisoning Bulletin has reported the original source of the outbreak strain of Salmonella Paratyphi B is a company called Bambang Surprapto in Bekasi, Indonesia. The exporter sold tempeh starter yeast, some of which was found to be tainted with Salmonella Paratyphi B, to clients all over the world including one in Rockville Md. which operated the websites IndonesianFoodMart.com and Tempeh Online. Smiling Hara of Asheville purchased the product from Tempeh Online and the tempeh it made resulted in at least 88 confirmed cases of Salmonellosis and Parathyphoid Fever, including some illnesses caused from person-to-person transmission.

The outbreak was first announced April 27 by Buncommbe County Health Department in North Carolina. Then, in a key piece of work by the North Carolina Department of Public Health.Lab, state investigators found an exact DNA match between the strain of Salmonella that was making people sick and the bacteria found in samples of Smiling Hara tempeh, which we now know was contaminated by the yeast ingredient made in Indonesia.

A good Salmonella tempeh lawyer can help victims of this outbreak receive fair compensation under laws designed to hold both foreign and domestic food makers accountable when they sell goods into the powerful U.S. marketplace. The privilege of entering the USA market with a profit-driven food product comes with the strict responsibility of ensuring that the offerings are wholesome and safe.

Food poisoning is preventable. Click and send your contact information to national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.

 Tempeh Salmonella Attorney and Lawyer 
 Posted on May 20, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

 Tempeh Salmonella food poisoning illnesses continue to mount, but at a slower pace as tracked by public health officials in North Carolina. In Asheville and Buncombe County -- the center of the three-month-old outbreak -- authorities report 62 confirmed cases of Paratyphoid Fever caused by the outbreak strain of Salmonella Paratyphi B. Another 21 illnesses have been reported in people who have traveled to the Asheville area or who have had other contact with the county.

 Salmonella attorney Fred Pritzker is accepting cases from this outbreak to win compensation for victims. The outbreak has been effectively traced to starter culture manufactured by Tempeh Online of Rockville, Maryland. Most of the people sickened in this outbreak ate the vegetarian meat substitute tempeh from Smiling Hara Tempeh -- an Asheville company that was unknowningly using contaminated starter culture. Families and individuals affected by this outbreak should hold both companies and their insurers accountable for selling contaminated product into the marketplace. Call Fred at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or contact the firm online to get a free case review. 

It&apos;s been several weeks since Smiling Hara&apos;s Chad Oliphant recalled all varieties and sizes of tempeh produced by this company since January. Since then, the volume of new illnesses has been declining but continues to trickle. Some infections are being caused by inadvertent person-to-person transmission from those who are sick. That&apos;s why public health leaders are continuing to warn those who may have been exposed to the bacteria to practice intense hand hygiene, especially after going to the bathroom.

Paratyphi B is a rare type of Salmonella in part because it has a 30-day incubation period as opposed to one to 10 days found in more common types. It causes Paratyphoid Fever, a systemic bacterial disease caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B or C. It causes diarrhea (sometimes bloody), sustained fever, severe headache, sluggishness, anorexia and as many as 15 other symptoms. In some case patients, but not all, the organism can result in rose spots on a person’s trunk, a non-productive cough early in the onset of illness and constipation in adults. Some patients may be hospitalized, but even those with milder infections can suffer long-term health consequences that should be addressed by a lawyer in the claims process.

 Food Poisoning Lawsuit For Tuna Sushi Salmonella Victims 
 Posted on May 18, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

An excellent and thorough food safety investigation by state and federal authorities into the raw tuna sushi Salmonella outbreak has provided multiple clear-cut reasons for a  food poisoning lawsuit .

 A team of lawyers from Pritzker Olsen Attorneys has filed such a sushi Salmonella suit in Boston on behalf of a resident of Malden, Massachusetts, who was hospitalized for treatment of Salmonellosis complications. The firm also represents other victims in the outbreak -- the largest documented wave of food poisoning in the United States this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented 316 confirmed cases in 26 states and the District of Columbia. Thirty-two people have been hospitalized and there have been no deaths.

The investigation by the CDC and FDA is ongoing. Epidemiologists from these agencies have identified two separate types of Salmonella -- Bareilly and Nchanga. They have linked both to contaminated raw yellowfin tuna scraped from tuna backbones at a processing facility in India. The tuna scrape was frozen and widely distributed in the United States to sushi restaurants and grocery store sushi counters where it gets made into spicy tuna rolls and other sushi or sashimi items.

People are still getting sick from this outbreak and Pritzker Olsen is continuing to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Onsets of illness were reported as recently as early May -- more than three weeks after the initial tuna recall by Moon Marine USA Corporation of Cupertino, California.

 A clear basis for action 

From information found by investigators, this nationwide outbreak of Salmonella was preventable. A food poisoning lawsuit will hold all purveyors of the adulterated tuna accountable. Making companies and their insurance policies pay for food poisoning is a well-practiced aspect of food safety in the United States because companies become more responsive. Here are some of the published findings and observations by government agencies that draw a clear link to the adulterated tuna.

 Lab testing in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin has isolated Salmonella from 53 of 55 samples taken from intact packages of frozen yellow fin tuna scrape from Moon Marine USA Corporation or from sushi prepared with the implicated scrape tuna product.  A six-day FDA inspection of the Moon Fishery facility in Kerala, India, that processed the tuna found numerous food safety violations including failures in following Critical Control Point food manufacturing protocols. Other FDA observations at the facility noted a failure to monitor&quot;the sanitation conditions and practices with sufficient frequency to assure conformance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices including safety of water that comes into contact with food or food contact surfaces.&apos;&apos; Inspectors at the India facility observed a processing plant that was located outside, subject to pests and the environment, including apparent bird feces on a rusty ice maker.&quot;You are not monitoring the condition or cleanliness of food contact surfaces,&apos;&apos; the report said. 

Pritzker Olsen is one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and has collected millions for outbreak victims. Lawyers from our Minneapolis-based firm are active in practically every major outbreak of food poisoning in the U.S. and they are involved in numerous causes and industry events aimed at stopping the spread of human pathogens in our food. You can contact the firm online by leaving minimal information about your case. A lawyer will respond.

 Dog Food Recall Salmonella Lawyer 
 Posted on May 17, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

 A long-running outbreak of Salmonella Infantis has been traced from people infected with the pathogen to dry dog food they handled in feeding pets, or to handling a pet dog that was fed with the contaminated dog food.

 People in nine states have been confirmed as case patients of this outbreak, which triggered a Salmonella dog food recall by Diamond Pet Foods. All suspect packages were manufactured at Diamond&apos;s plant in Gaston, South Carolina between December 9, 2011 and April 7, 2012. Brands include  Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul, Country Value, Diamond, Diamond Naturals, Premium Edge, Professional, 4Health, Taste of the Wild, Apex, Kirkland Signature/Kirkland Signature Nature’s Domain and Canidae.  

The connection between human Salmonellosis and dry pet food was discovered on April 2 by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Inspectors detected Salmonella  Infantis, a rare strain, in an unopened bag of Diamond Naturals Lamb Meal&amp;Rice dry dog food during routine retail testing. Public health investigators used PulseNet to identify recent cases of human illness from bacteria with the same genetic code as the  Salmonella Infantis found in the dog food.. People had been getting sick from this strain since October 2011.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuing to investigate this outbreak, which includes confirmed cases in Alabama (1), Connecticut (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (3), North Carolina (3), New Jersey (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (2) and Virginia (1).

 Salmonella Bareilly Suit Filed against Moon Marine for Sushi Tuna Food Poisoning by National Salmonella Attorneys 
 Posted on May 9, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

National food poisoning lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., have filed a sushi Salmonella lawsuit on behalf of a resident of Malden, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, who is battling a severe infection of Salmonella Bareilly as part of well-documented national outbreak.

 The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston is against Moon Marine USA, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of California. The plaintiff seeks damages in excess of $75,000, including hospital billings at Massachusetts General and lost time at work while the infection persisted.
 &quot;Our clients have suffered and will continue to suffer great physical and emotional pain because tuna scrape used for sushi rolls was adulterated with a dangerous pathogen,&apos;&apos; said Fred Pritzker , lead attorney for the firm’s Salmonella lawsuits.&quot;My experience is that big outbreaks like this are caused by poor sanitation measures and inadequate pathogen testing.&apos;&apos;   Pritzker also represents other victims of the outbreak and is continuing to accept cases from those who are among the hundreds who have been confirmed as case patients. The contaminated tuna from Moon Marine has made people sick in 24 states and the District of Columbia. For a free case review, call Fred at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information online.   Massachusetts Salmonella Suit   According to the complaint, on March 26, 2012, the Salmonella Bareilly victim ate a spicy tuna roll at the Thelonious Monkfish restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that contained“Nakaochi Scrape”manufactured and sold by the defendant Moon Marine. Two days later, she began to suffer severe gastroenteritis including vomiting, cramping and severe diarrhea. Her symptoms continued to intensify over the next two days until she sought medical treatment at Mass General.   After receiving medical treatment, a stool sample was taken at the hospital and later tested positive for Salmonella Bareilly. Further testing by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health showed it was a PFGE match (genetic match) to the Salmonella Bareilly outbreak cluster.   Since becoming ill in March, several more stool samples have been taken, and have all tested positive for Salmonella Bareilly. Because the plaintiff has not had a negative stool sample, she is unable to legally return to work.    Pritzker Olsen is one of the few law firms in the nation practicing extensively in the area of food poisoning litigation and has collected millions for victims of Salmonella . The firm has offices at Plaza VII, Suite 2950, 45 South Seventh Street, Minneapolis, MN 55402

 Sushi Salmonella Lawsuit Inside Story 
 Posted on May 8, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

Any Sushi Salmonella lawsuit against tuna importer Moon Marine USA Corporation of Cupertino, California, will be rooted in dedicated work performed by a multitude of public health agencies led by the FDA and CDC. 

Inside the FDA, much credit is being given to a special urgent-response unit known as the Incident Management Group (IMG). According to an online FDA consumer update published recently, IMG operates out of the high-tech Emergency Operations Center at FDA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland.

 When the Salmonella Bareilly outbreak hit the U.S. across multiple states, IMG assembled a team of more than 30 FDA experts who specialize in a variety of areas. Their job was to investigate the outbreak and track down its source. The same bacteria ultimately made 258 people sick in 24 states and the District of Columbia.

By early April, the focus of the investigation shifted to six clusters of cases around restaurants or grocery stores in five states. Interviews with outbreak victims suggested that the common food consumed and likely source of infection was sushi made with raw tuna—and specifically, spicy tuna.
 From there, IMG members selected and mapped four of the clusters of illnesses in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Texas, and Wisconsin. Further analysis verified that all four had received the same imported, frozen raw Nakaochi Scrape yellowfin tuna product from a single tuna processing facility in India. The scraped fish was imported by Moon Marine, the investigators found.   The IMG team consisted of FDA experts on such subjects as outbreak investigation coordination, epidemiology, public and environmental health, food safety, seafood, imported products, legal issues, and cartography. They scrutinized thousands of pages of invoices, shipping records and bills of lading. All together, including other federal agency workers, state and local health officials, the response to the outbreak involved hundreds of government employees. For victims of this outbreak, free case reviews are available by leaving your contact information online or by calling PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Our firm already represents individuals in civil action against Moon Marine and is one of the very few legal groups in the U.S. practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation.

 Restaurant Salmonella Outbreak in N.C. 
 Posted on May 6, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 A restaurant in Dilworth, North Carolina, is the center of a Salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 15 people possibly more. Toast Cafe was inspected by the Mecklenberg County Department of Health, where environmental health specialist examiner Lynn Lathan found some trouble spots.

 She told WBTV in Charlotte that Toast Cafe in Dilworth was making up hollandaise sauce without using a pasteurized egg. Once the sauce was mixed, it was allowed to sit at room temperature.&quot;We did not have proper refrigeration. We had pooling of eggs going on,&quot;Lathan told the station.

In all, the county received reports of 29 people who became ill with gastroenteritis after eating at the cafe in late March. Fifteen cases were said to be confirmed Salmonella infections. 

 

 Salmonellosis is a major foodborne illness that results in 1.4 million infections, 15,000 hospitalizations, and 400 deaths each year in the United States. And approximately half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings. 

 Salmonella symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and headache. These acute symptoms may last for one or two days or may be prolonged depending on virulence factors. Salmonella is especially dangerous for infants, the elderly, and people with HIV or in treatment for cancer. Salmonellosis should not be taken lightly and people who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor. In some cases there are chronic consequences. Arthritic symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. One of the most severe and painful complications is reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. 

 Where You Can Go For Help 

If you or someone close to you sought medical attention for a Salmonella infection after eating at Toast Cafe in Dilworth, you are entitled to seek compensation for your harms. Free case consultations are available at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the few legal groups in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. We have collected millions for victims of outbreaks and can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information online and a lawyer will contact you.

 Salmonella Dog Food Recall Litigation 
 Posted on May 4, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

 A dog food recall is intended to stop a Salmonella outbreak that has sickened people in Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and six other states. Contact with dry dog food manufactured in South Carolina by Diamond Pet Foods has been identified by CDC as a primary cause of illness in some case patients.

 Here are the states involved in the outbreak followed by the number of confirmed case patients from each state: Alabama (1), Connecticut (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (3), North Carolina (3), New Jersey (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Virginia (1).

Food poisoning law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is advising people who think they might have become ill after contact with Diamond Pet Food or animals who have eaten it should immediately consult a physician. The type of Salmonella in this outbreak -- infantis -- is somewhat virulent based on the fact that 56 percent of patients with available information have been hospitalized.

Multiple varieties of Diamond puppy food produced by Diamond Pet Foods are involved in the recall. 

 Symptoms of Human Infection from Salmonella Infantis 

Most persons infected with Salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, (sometimes bloody) fever, and painful stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness from Salmonella infection, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome or reactive arthritis.

 Salmonella Attorney and Lawsuit 

Attorneys from Pritzker Olsen have opened an investigation into the Diamond Pet Food Salmonella outbreak and recall for purposes of a dog food lawsuit on behalf of the pet owners who became ill from handling contaminated product. Even if your case was not life-threatening, you are entitled to make a claim against the manufacturer and its insurance company to compensate you for any associated medical expense, pain and suffering, lost time at work, travel and other related expenses -- including long-term harms that Salmonella is known to cause in some case patients.

Call an attorney at the firm 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or submit your contact information online and a lawyer from the firm will call you to discuss the details of your case. Our firm is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in the areas of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for Salmonella outbreak victims.

 Sushi Salmonella Outbreak in 2 Strains 
 Posted on May 2, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

At least 258 people in 24 states and the District of Columbia have been sickened since early this year with Salmonella from contaminated raw tuna used in sushi, including spicy tuna rolls. One of the breakthroughs in the investigation -- which has been scientifically linked to raw yellowfin tuna scrape from Moon Marine USA Corporation -- is that it involves to separate types of Salmonella , both rarely found in the United States.

 If you or a loved one has been sickened by either strain in this outbreak, you have standing to make a claim for compensation from Moon Marine and its insurance company even if your illness was not life-threatening. Pritzker Olsen Attorneys continues to accept cases for representation in a sushi Salmonella lawsuit. 

The evidence collected from a joint investigation by state, local and federal public health agencies has produced a solid chain of evidence linking Moon Marine of Cupertino, California, to this outbreak based on frozen raw tuna it acquired from India. Salmonella is not normally associated with fish, so investigators believe the product was cross-contaminated somewhere in the supply line leading to the United States.

The two strains confirmed to be in the tuna and in outbreak victims are Salmonella Bareilly and Salmonella Nchanga. By far the dominant Salmonella type in this outbreak is Bareilly, which also was found through lab analysis in the state of Wisconsin to be in a spicy tuna roll and one sample of recalled tuna.

 If you have been notified by the health department that your illness belongs to this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information and one of our attorneys will call you. Years of experience have taught us that food poisoning is a preventable disease. When food is contaminated, it&apos;s usually because someone who is profiting from it didn&apos;t take proper care to keep the product wholesome. While one in six Americans every year fall ill to some form of foodborne illness, national outbreaks such as this one involving a known transmission vehicle are unusual.

 Salmonella Tempeh Recall in Asheville NC 
 Posted on April 30, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

A North Carolina recall of soy-based tempeh made by an Asheville company called Smiling Hara Tempeh is giving a new wrinkle to the investigation of Salmonella Paratyphi B in the area, which includes all of Buncombe County.

 North Carolina officials found Salmonella in Smiling Hara&apos;s soybean tempeh during a routine inspection and is currently testing it against the strain that is causing the outbreak. Now the company is recalling soybean tempeh manufactured this year between January 11 and April 11. The containers are marked with a best-by date of 7/11/12 through 10/25/12. Tempeh is used as a meat substitute in vegetarian cuisine. Smiling Hara&apos;s products are raw, meaning they are meant to be cooked. It takes temperatures of 160 o 165 degrees to kill Salmonella bacteria. 

“Anyone with this product in their possession should not eat it,”said North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler.

In the Buncombe County outbreak, people infected by Salmonella paratyphi B are falling ill with fever, diarrhea, malaise, severe headache and other symptoms. The disease is called Paratyphoid Fever, so-named for its more aggressive cousin, Typhoid Fever. Some patients may be hospitalized, but even those with milder infections can suffer long-term health consequences that should be addressed by a lawyer in the claims process.

 Sushi Tuna Recall Salmonella Finding 
 Posted on April 26, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

The sushi tuna recall in the Salmonella Bareilly outbreak has been reaffirmed by Wisconsin state laboratory testing that positively matched the outbreak strain of Salmonella in people to samples of the raw yellowfin tuna scrape recalled by importer Moon Marine USA Corporation two weeks ago.

 

One of the molecular matches was found in a sample of spicy tuna roll made from the recalled tuna. Spicy tuna rolls were an item that public health investigators identified early on as closely correlated to the outbreak. While the initial link between the Salmonella outbreak and frozen, raw tuna distributed by Moon Marinie was established through interviews of patients, restaurant operators and grocery store owners -- the DNA match produced by Wisconsin provides rock-solid evidence of what caused this outbreak. 

In Wisconsin, 15 people have been sickened by the outbreak strain of Salmonella, including three who have been hospitalized. Most of the cases have been in the greater Milwaukee metropolitan area, including Waukesha. The Wisconsin sushi Salmonella outbreak also included at least one cluster of illnesses around a sushi restaurant.

Outside Wisconsin, another 145 confirmed cases have been established in 19 other states, with about 16 percent of case patients hospitalized.

 Sushi Tuna Recall Information 

On April 13, 2012, Moon Marine (also known as MMI) of Cupertino, California, voluntarily recalled all frozen raw yellowfin tuna product, labeled as Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA. The product -- almost 60,000 pounds of it -- was not available for sale to individual consumers, but may have been used to make sushi, sashimi, ceviche and similar dishes available in restaurants and grocery stores. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is continuing to trace the recalled tuna forward from the recalling company through the subsequent distribution. Tracing the recalled tuna backward, the trail has led to at least one tuna processor in India.

Freezing tuna used in sushi usually kills bacteria inherent to the fish, but not Salmonella, which has other animal origins. Officials want to know how the ground tuna scrape became contaminated.

 Help for Victims 

A sushi tuna lawsuit may be required for victims of this outbreak to recover money for medical expenses, pain, suffering, loss of work and other harms -- including long-term health consequences that studies have shown will crop up in people who endure Salmonellosis. If you or a loved one is a confirmed case patient call food poisoning attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information online and a lawyer will call you.

 Salmonella Sushi Outbreak Puzzles Expert 
 Posted on April 12, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

A scientist who has studied food poisoning outbreaks isn&apos;t optimistic that public health investigators will successfully trace the origin of the 20-state Salmonella Bareilly outbreak now under investigation by the FDA, CDC and their state partners. Raw tuna, sushi, sashimi, cerviche or similar products are suspected in illnesses suffered by at least 116 people..

 Dr. O Peter Snyder, founder of the Hospitality Institute of Technology and Management in St. Paul, Minnesota, said the outbreak is unusual because Salmonella is a pathogen associated with warm-blooded animals, not fish. He suspects tuna was cross-contaminated somewhere along the supply chain in a big way. For instance, it may have been a one-time incident in a facility handling tuna and warm-blooded animals.

CDC has called Salmonella Bareilly uncommon in the U.S. and Snyder said it probably came from another part of the world because the food supply to the United States is so vast. So far, 12 to 14 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak, which is the largest wave of food poisoning so far in 2012. The states hardest hit have been New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois and Wisconsin.

If you or a loved one has been sickened in this outbreak and have questions about a Salmonella sushi lawsuit, call PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food poisoning law firm that has collected millions for victims of Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter and Listeria outbreaks. Food contamination is a dangerous defect that causes both short-term and long-term harm in people. Companies who profit from this trade should be held accountable for the human and financial costs.

 Tuna Sushi A Suspect In Salmonella Outbreak That Hospitalizes Two In Louisiana 
 Posted on April 9, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

Two Louisiana residents have been hospitalized by the Salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 100 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to state officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

Louisiana has a total of two confirmed cases who are part of the multi-state outbreak, both are form the southeastern part of the state and both required hospitalization after contracting Salmonella Bareilly infections between February 14 and February 18 2012.

 State and federal health officials have been working together since January to determine the source of the outbreak, but have not yet pinpointed one. However, because many of the patients, including one from Louisiana, reported eating sushi prior to becoming ill, sushi, sashimi and other dishes made with raw tuna or other raw fish are among the suspected food sources.

  Symptoms of a Salmonella infection include diarrhea which can sometimes be bloody, fever, and abdominal cramps developing six to 72 hours after exposure. The illness usually lasts four to seven days but in some cases the diarrhea is so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. If a  Salmonella  infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream, it can be fatal if untreated.

Complications of a Salmonella i nfection can have long-term consequences and include bacteremia - a life threatening infection of the blood that can infect the brain (meningitis), heart (endocarditis), bones (osteomyelitis), and other parts of the body; colitis and reactive arthritis (Reiter&apos;s syndrome) - eye irritation, painful urination, painful joints and other sources of pain.

Health officials urge anyone with symptoms of a Salmonella infection to seek medical attention. Those with legal questions about an illness or a hospitalization associated with this outbreak can contact a food poisoning attorney at the law firm of Pritzker Olsen P.A. for a free consultation.

 New Jersey Salmonella Tuna Sushi Outbreak 
 Posted on April 8, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

New Jersey is one of six states to report additional tuna sushi Salmonella illnesses, pushing the outbreak&apos;s original case count from 93 to 100. The Garden State now has a total of seven confirmed Salmonella Bareilly illnesses -- fifth most in the fast-growing outbreak that has spread to 18 other states and the District of Columbia.

 Across the country, at least 10 of the outbreak victims have been hospitalized . It&apos;s not clear from public reports if any of the hospitalizations were in New Jersey. The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the outbreak in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its state and local partners.

If you or a loved one has fallen ill with diarrhea, painful stomach cramps and/or mild fever after eating spicy tuna rolls, other sushi or sashimi items or similar food, you should immediately see a physician and be stool-tested for the outbreak strain of Salmonella.  Some people mistakenly underestimate the severity of Salmonella , but an infection can result in several serious complications, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , or reactive arthritis, a condition that can plague a person for life.

So far, the federal investigation into the sushi Salmonella outbreak has not conclusively identified a food source. If a specific food source is identified for this outbreak, public health officials will alert the public. The parties responsible for the largest U.S. outbreak of food poisoning in 2012 also will be subject to a New Jersey Salmonella lawsuit and other litigation. 

Attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., handle some of the most complex foodborne illness claims in the country and they have collected tens of millions of dollars for Salmonella outbreak victims, including a number of Salmonella death settlements. Our firm is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and Pritzker lawyers are poised to help you if you call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or leave your contact information and an attorney will call you.

 Tainted Tuna Sushi A Suspect In Salmonella Outbreak That Sickens Five Virginia 
 Posted on April 6, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Five Virginia residents are among the 100 victims of a Salmonella outbreak that has spread through 19 states and the District of Columbia.

The victims are between the ages of 20 and 59 and are from the central and northwestern part of the state, according to a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Health. Case patients from all states range in age from 4 to 78, according to the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Forty seven percent are female and 53 percent are male, according to the CDC.

State and federal health officials have been working since February to identify the source of the outbreak but have not yet pinpointed one, according to the CDC update. In patient interviews, foods made from raw tuna or other raw fish including sushi and sashimi were mentioned, so they are among the foods being investigated.

Outbreak victims have all been sickened by the same rare strain of Salmonella called Salmonella Bareilly . Salmonella poisoning can be serious and in some cases life-threatening, according to the CDC. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning include abdominal cramping, fever, nausea,vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Health officials urge anyone with those symptoms to see a health care provider.

The CDC’s latest case count by state is as follows: Alabama (2), Arkansas (1), Connecticut (5), District of Columbia (2), Georgia (4), Illinois (9), Louisiana (2), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (4), Mississippi (1), Missouri (1), New Jersey (7), New York (23), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (3), Rhode Island (4), South Carolina (3), Texas (3), Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (9).

 Tuna Sushi Salmonella Outbreak Grows to 100 
 Posted on April 6, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Attorney Fred Pritzker 

The tuna sushi Salmonella Bareilly outbreak has grown to 100 confirmed cases in 19 states and the District of Columbia:

Alabama (2), Arkansas (1), Connecticut (5), District of Columbia (2), Georgia (4), Illinois (9), Louisiana (2), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (4), Mississippi (1), Missouri (1), New Jersey (7), New York (23), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (3), Rhode Island (4), South Carolina (3), Texas (3), Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (9).

 

 

Although the investigation of the outbreak has not conclusively identified a food source, a statistically significant number of people sickened in this outbreak ate raw tuna sushi, sashimi or a similar product prior to the onset of Salmonella symptoms . Restaurants selling these products are being investigated, and traceback investigations to determine where the contamination happened are ongoing.

Raw tuna (ahi tuna) has been the source of past Salmonella outbreaks, including 2 multistate outbreaks, one in 2010 and the other in 2007-2008. Both outbreaks involved previously frozen, internationally imported raw ahi tuna.

There are very few sources of sushi-quality tuna, so we are hoping that the source of the outbreak is found and prevention measures will be implemented.

Every victim of this Salmonella Bareilly outbreak has the legal right to pursue compensation from responsible parties. At this point, for most victims the restaurant where the sushi or sashimi was purchased is the responsible party. Our Salmonella lawyers are available for a free consultation regarding a lawsuit against a restaurant, the raw tuna supplier and others. For a free consultation click here .

 Tuna Sushi Is Suspect In Salmonella Outbreak That Sickens 10 In Baltimore Area 
 Posted on April 6, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Ten people from the Baltimore area are among the 100 case patients of a Salmonella o utbreak that has spread through 19 states and the District of Columbia.

 The ten cases in Maryland are all from the greater Baltimore area, Albina Chu, a spokeswoman from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, told Food Poisoning Bulletin in an interview today. Chu said the state does not disclose certain information about outbreak case patients such as their gender or county of residence. 

 Health officials have still not identified a definite source of the outbreak, according to the l atest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but foods made from raw tuna such as sushi and sashimi are among potential sources being investigated. 

 Salmonella  poisoning can cause moderate to life-threatening illness, according to the CDC. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea which can sometimes be bloody. A fever sometimes accompanies other symptoms which usually set in between six and 72 hours after exposure and last four to seven days. In some cases, where severe diarrhea causes dehydration, hospitalization is required. Infections that move into the bloodstream can be fatal if untreated. Health officials urge anyone with these symptoms to see a health care provider. 

Anyone with legal questions about an illness or hospitalization associated with this outbreak can call one of the Salmonella lawyers at the law firm of PritzkerOlsen P.A . for a free consultation.

 Ninth Tuna Sushi Salmonella Case Hits WI 
 Posted on April 6, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Another documented Wisconsin illness in the tuna sushi Salmonella outbreak has made the greater Milwaukee area and nearby Waukesha County a hot spot in the scramble by investigators to find out what specific ingredient in tuna rolls or which raw tuna itself is giving people infections.

 With a total of nine confirmed illnesses caused by the outbreak strain of Salmonella Bareilly, Wisconsin is one of the hardest hit states in the country and health investigators have been busy interviewing victims about what they ate in the weeks before falling ill with diarrhea, painful abdominal cramps, fever, headache and other symptoms. At least three of the nine Wisconsin Salmonella victims were hospitalized compared to seven hospitalizations in the 18 other outbreak states -- including Illinois, Texas and New York.

Stephanie Smiley, Communications Director of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the latest Wisconsin case patient lives in Milwaukee County. A total of four state cases are in Milwaukee County while five are in Waukesha County, she said. In response to the crush of media coverage, Smiley says her department will give daily updates on the tuna Salmonella outbreak on weekdays.

 The outbreak coincides with the last week in Lent, one of the heaviest fish-buying periods of the year. Good Friday, in particular, is a day of heavy fish consumption in the U.S. 

If you or a loved on has fallen ill after consuming raw tuna, spicy tuna roll or other sushi product, or if you ate at a Japanese style restaurant and became sick, see your doctor immediately and get tested. You could be at risk for Reiter&apos;s Syndrome or one of the other serious and long-term complications of Salmonellosis and your case could be the one that helps investigators unlock the puzzle that still surrounds the root of the outbreak, which has moved rapidly in the two months that it&apos;s been active.

Questions about a Wisconsin tuna Salmonella lawsuit or other litigation that may stem from this outbreak will be answered free of charge by attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food safety law firm that has recovered tens of millions for food outbreak victims. The Pritzker legal group, with central offices in Minneapolis, is one of the very few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of food-borne illness litigation and the firm has started its own investigation of this outbreak in Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Texas and other states.

 New York Hit Hardest By Salmonella Outbreak Possibly Caused by Tuna Sushi and Sashimi 
 Posted on April 5, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
At least 23 New Yorkers have been sickened and one has been hospitalized by the  multi-state Salmonella outbreak announced this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),

 The source of the outbreak, which has sickened  93 people in 19 states and the District of  Columbia, has not yet been determined, although dozens of patients reported eating sushi, sashimi or other raw fish products before they became ill. 

 In New York, some case patients also reported eating sushi before becoming ill. Peter Constantakes, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, told food Poisoning Bulletin that sushi is&quot;one of the suspects we’re looking at.&quot; 

 Most of the illnesses were concentrated in the city and in five surrounding counties including: Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Putnam and Westchester, he said in the story.  Onset of illness dates ranged from January 28 to March 8. One person was hospitalized, but was discharged and has recovered, said Constantakes. 

 Salmonella can cause an infection that can be serious and sometimes life-threatening. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning symptoms include, nausea, vomiting abdominal cramping and diarrhea, which is sometimes bloody. Usually, symptoms appear six to 72 hours after exposure and last four to seven days. Sometimes the diarrhea is so severe it causes dehydration and the patient needs to be hospitalized. If the infection spreads to the bloodstream this is called sepsis, and it can be fatal if not treated immediately. Health officials urge anyone who develops these symptoms after eating food they believe was tainted to contact a health care provider.

 Chicago Sushi Salmonella Cases Occupy Spotlight of Fast-Growing Outbreak 
 Posted on April 5, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Eight people from Illinois are confirmed to be case patients in the fast-developing Salmonella Bareilly outbreak that federal health officials have associated with sushi but are still scrambling to understand.

Five of eight cases in Illinois were reported in Chicago, while two were in Will County and one was in suburban Cook County, the state Department of Public Health said. Two people were hospitalized..

Illinois is second only to New York in the number of confirmed Salmonella outbreak cases. The Land of Lincoln is tied with Wisconsin and Maryland. The Department of Public Health in Chicago has not made announcements about the outbreak, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it has an ongoing investigation into specific types of sushi. An internal FDA memo that was circulated outside the agency mentioned spicy tuna roll as highly suspect..

 Still, with 93 confirmed cases in 19 states, officials are not comfortable saying what food is causing the outbreak and they have given no advice to consumers on what to avoid. Besides the raw tuna itself, the possibilities range from sesame seeds to raw vegetable pieces. Meanwhile, 10 people have been hospitalized in the two months that the outbreak has emerged. At this point there has been zero deaths tied to the outbreak.

The CDC is working with state health officials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine the cause of the outbreak and keep people informed about important developments. More cases are expected to be confirmed in the days ahead.

&quot;If a specific food source is identified for this outbreak, public health officials will alert the public and take further steps to prevent additional illnesses,&apos;&apos; the CDC said in its initial investigation announcement.

Illinois victims are among those who could be interviewed by health officials about what they ate prior to falling ill. Many of the ill persons interviewed so far reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before getting sick.

If you or a loved one is ill with diarrhea, vomiting or painful stomach cramps after eating at a Japanese style restaurant or other sushi place, see your doctor immediately for a diagnosis and possible treatment with antibiotics.

Eight Wisconsin residents are part of the multi-state Salmonella Bareilly outbreak that has sickened at least 93 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to state health officials. Three of the eight people sickened in Wisconsin required hospitalization.

Officials from two state and two county agencies in Wisconsin have been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate the outbreak which has sickened eight Wisconsinites since February. All of the patients are adults. Three of the confirmed cases are in Milwaukee county, five are in Waukesha county.

Health officials from Milwaukee and Waukesha counties, the state Department of Health Services (DHS) and the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) have been working with federal officials to interview patients about their food histories and other exposures. The investigation is ongoing and the source of the outbreak has not yet been determined.

 Salmonella is a pathogen which, if ingested can cause an infection called salmonellosis. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning include, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea beginning six to 72 hours after exposure and last four to seven days. Health officials urge anyone who develops these symptoms after eating food they believe was tainted to contact a health care provider.

 Officials Search For Source Of Salmonella Outbreak That Sickens 93 In 19 States 
 Posted on April 4, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 State and federal health officials are  collaborating on an investigation of a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Bareilly that has sickend at least 93 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to a statement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today. At least 10 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. 

The case count by state is as follows: Alabama (2), Arkansas (1), Connecticut (4), District of Columbia (2), Georgia (4), Illinois (8), Louisiana (2), Maryland (8), Massachusetts (4), Mississippi (1), Missouri (1), New Jersey (6), New York (23), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (2), Rhode Island (4), South Carolina (3), Texas (3), Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (8). 

The investigation, which began January 28, 2012 is ongoing and investigators are still trying to determine the source of the outbreak and whether it is foodborne. State health officials are interviewing those who became ill to learn which foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week prior to the onset of illness. During   initial interviews, many people reported that they had eaten sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill. 

  Salmonella Bareilly is an unusual serotype of Salmonella, according to the CDC .   Symptoms of a  Salmonella  infection include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps which set in six to 72 hours after infection and  last four to seven days. In some cases,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. If the infection spreads to the bloodstream and then to other body sites, it can be fatal if untreated.
 &quot;Consumers can be reassured that FDA and CDC are working vigorously on this investigation and will provide updates as soon as they are available,&quot;the agency said in a statement today.&quot;If a specific food source is identified for this outbreak, public health officials will alert the public and take further steps to prevent additional illnesses.&quot; 
Anyone who believes they may have become ill from eating a potentially contaminated food product should consult their health care providers. Anyone with legal questions about an illness associated with this outbreak can contact a Salmonella lawyer at the law firm PritzkerOlsen P.A. , a national leader in food safety.

At least seven people have been hospitalized, according to the AP.

The outbreak strain is  Salmonella Bareilly . If ingested,  Salmonella  can cause an infection called salmonellosis, which can be severe. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning  include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever which set in between six and 72 hours of eating the contaminated food and last two to seven days. Salmonellosis can be life-threatening for people with weakened immune systems.

Health officials urge anyone who becomes ill after eating sushi to see a health care provider.

 Salmonella Found in Raw Milk and Raw Milk Cheese Produced by Kutztown, PA Dairy 
 Posted on April 3, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Pennsylvania is having more problems with raw milk contamination. Earlier this year, dozens of people contracted Campylobacter infections ( campylobacteriosis ) from raw milk sold by Your Family Cow in Chambersburg, PA. Now Salmonella has shown up in raw milk products produced in Kutztown, PA

Today, the Pennsylvania departments of Agriculture and Health issued a news release advising consumers and retailers who purchased raw milk and raw milk cheese from Norman Z. and Edith B. Sauder in Kutztown, Berks County, PA, to discard or return the raw milk products immediately.

On April 1, an independent lab confirmed that raw milk and raw cheese from the farm had tested positive for Salmonella . The contaminated products had a date code of March 25, 2012.
 
&quot;I guess all I can say is me and my nine children drink it and we never had a problem with it,&quot;Norman Sauder told the Express-Times , noting his children range in age from 2 to 19.&quot;We had one test that come back positive but we had one test that came back negative after that.&quot;Raw milk and raw milk cheese sales have been suspended at the facility until additional testing is completed.
 
According to the Department of Agriculture, all samples tested must be free of Salmonella and all other pathogens before the farm can resume selling raw milk and raw milk cheese. The farm must also pass an inspection by Pennsylvania health officials. To date, the Department of Health is not aware of any illnesses related to these products.

 Articles Look at Afteraffects of Food Poisoning and Sepsis 
 Posted on April 2, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
I was reading Maryn McKenna’s excellent article in Scientific American ,&quot; Food Poisoning&apos;s Hidden Legacy ,”went to her Google+ page to read more about her, and then surfed my way to“ Saving Carol Decker: Her Nearly-Fatal Fight With Sepsis ,”an article by Ms. McKenna published in Self .

If anyone is still reading this post and not off reading one of Ms. McKenna’s articles (both highly recommended), there are legal takeaways from these articles.

The goal of food poisoning litigation is to fully and fairly compensate the victim for the economic, physical and emotional pain suffered as a result of the food poisoning. This should include amounts for expected lifelong aftereffects of the illness, including living with the increased risk of future kidney failure, reactive arthritis, heart problems and intestinal problems.

Medical research outlining the incidence and cause of health problems related to past food poisoning illnesses is persuasive. Ms. McKenna mentions the Walkerton Health Study, a long-term study of an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Walkerton, Ontario in May of 2000 caused by water contaminated with E. coli O157 and Campylobacter . Over 2000 people were sickened. The most recent results of the study, published in 2010, show an increased risk for hypertension (dangerously high blood pressure), renal impairment (kidney damage and failure), and cardiovascular (heart) disease. The full article can be read here .

Ms. McKenna’s article on sepsis looks at how it changed the lives of one courageous woman and her family. The source of the infection that caused her sepsis was never determined.

Infections caused by foodborne pathogens ( Campylobacter , E. coli , Listeria , Salmonella and Shigella ) can cause sepsis. Although a foodborne pathogen was probably not the cause of the case of sepsis discussed in the article, sepsis caused by any one of them can result in the same devastating results or death. Most of our food poisoning wrongful death cases involve sepsis.

I like Ms. McKenna’s appropriately dramatic description of sepsis:
 
Sepsis itself isn&apos;t an infection; rather, it&apos;s our body&apos;s overreaction to an infection we already have. Even if you treat it early, any infection—a simple cut, a urinary tract infection or a more serious illness such as pneumonia—can set off a systemic inflammatory response: The immune system fires out defensive cells and chemicals in a chain reaction, and the body responds like an engine revving out of control. The heart races. Blood pressure plummets. The walls of veins and arteries turn permeable, and the liquid part of the blood leaks into the rest of the body, depleting the blood volume within the vessels and making it harder for them to carry oxygen into tissues. Without oxygen, the brain and other organs begin to die.
 
Sepsis is a risk with every food poisoning infection. This is one reason why food poisoning victims should not immediately settle their cases. What may seem like a case worth a few thousand dollars may turn into a case worth millions.

 Turtles Cause 3 Salmonella Outbreaks 
 Posted on March 30, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Small turtles are causing a trio of overlapping Salmonella outbreaks that have sickened at least 66 people in 16 states, including 11 who have been hospitalized. More than half of the victims are younger than 11 years old.

 The outbreaks involve three different types of Salmonella . Trace-back investigations found that turtles with shells less than 4 inches long or their environments are the cause of the outbreaks. Reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people. Two of the current outbreaks involve red-eared slider turtles.

There&apos;s been an FDA ban on the sale and distribution of small turtles since 1975. That&apos;s how strongly these animals are associated with Salmonella, a human pathogen that causes diarrhea, vomiting, painful cramps and fever. In children, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems, infections can become severe, even deadly. One of the complications associated with Salmonella infection is Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , or reactive arthritis, an auto-immune condition that causes joint pain and other complications.

 Salmonella Sandiego Outbreak : A total of 45 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (3), Georgia (1), Massachusetts (2), Maryland (5), New Jersey (5), New Mexico (3), New York (18), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (6), and Virginia (1).

 Salmonella Pomona Outbreak : A total of 9 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Pomona have been reported from 8 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (2), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (1), Texas (1), and Vermont (1).

 Salmonella Poona Outbreak : A total of 12 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Poona have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (2), California (3), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Michigan (1), New York (2), and Texas (2).

 Risk of Salmonella in Baby Chicks 
 Posted on March 23, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
About 50 million live poultry chicks are sold every year in the United States and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- after documenting two large Salmonella outbreaks in 2011 -- states that Salmonella from live chicks or ducklings continues to be a public health problem.

 Since 1990, approximately 35 outbreaks of human Salmonella infections linked to contact with live poultry from mail-order hatcheries have been reported. A trait common to all of these Salmonellosis outbreaks is that young children dominate the population of victims. 

Take the two outbreaks from 2011 tracked by the CDC. From February 25 to October 10, a cluster of 68 cases caused by Salmonella serotype Altona and a cluster of 28 cases caused by Salmonella Johannesburg were identified in 24 states. Among persons infected, 32 percent of those infected with Salmonella Altona and 75 percent of those with Salmonella Johannesburg were less than 5 years old.

 The chicks and ducklings were purchased at multiple locations, but many of the outlets were supplied by a single mail-order hatchery. Now public health agencies have teamed with the hatchery industry and U.S. Department of Agriculture&apos;s National Poultry Improvement Plan to develop and implement a comprehensive Salmonella control strategy. Among other things, education materials warning customers of the risk for Salmonella infection from live poultry contact should be included in every shipment.

 Rodent Droppings and Salmonella in Feed Prompt Daizen Egg Warning 
 Posted on March 22, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
After discovering chicken feed contaminated with Salmonella and rodent droppings, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) is warning consumers not eat eggs produced by Daizen Farms of Burlington, Wash.

 WSDA inspectors discovered poor sanitation elsewhere on the farm and observed rodent droppings inside an egg-washing machine during use. According to a report by KOMO news, investigators discovered an infestation of as many as 20,000 rats and found tens of thousands of hens living in such terrible conditions they had to shut down operation on the farm.

Distribution records are inaccurate or incomplete, officials say, but they have been able to publish a partial distribution list. 

 

The warning applies to all eggs produced by the farm. None of the eggs, which are sold in 15-dozen flats and one-dozen consumer cartons, bears a date. The one-dozen egg consumer cartons are labeled with the Daizen branding and are most frequently sold to customers directly from the farm.

The boxes containing the 15-dozen egg flats are not marked with branding or any other identifying information, which is a violation of state labeling requirements. The boxes are most frequently sold to independent Asian grocery stores and restaurants in Skagit, Snohomish, and King Counties.
 So far, no illness have been reported in association with these eggs. Symptoms of salmonellosis include fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming contaminated foods. Illness usually lasts between four and seven days and most people recover without antibiotic treatment. However, some cases can be so severe they require hospitalization.   Anyone who thinks they may have become ill from eating these eggs should contact their health care provider. Anyone who has legal questions about an illness or hospitalization that may be associated with these eggs and would like a free consultation with a Salmonella attorney  should contact t he law firm of PritzkerOlsen, a national leader in food safety. The toll free number is 1 (888) 377-8900.

 Del Monte Fresh Produce Drops Threat To Sue Oregon Public Health 
 Posted on March 16, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Del Monte Fresh Produce has withdrawn its threat to sue Oregon Public Health and its senior food safety official, according to a story in The Oregonian. 

In August, 2011 Del Monte sued the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to seek an injunction that would lift an FDA ban restricting the importation of whole, fresh cantaloupes into the United States. The ban stemmed from a cantaloupe Salmonella outbreak linked to tainted melons imported by Del Monte from Guatemala. The outbreak sickened 20 people in 10 states. Del Monte recalled cantaloupes, then sued the FDA saying the prolonged ban was hurting business.
 
A week after Del Monte sued the FDA, it filed a notice of intent to sue Oregon’s public health unit and senior epidemiologist William Keene. In an August press release, Del Monte said that its“Notice to Sue alerts the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division of its conduct and misleading allegations regarding Del Monte Fresh’s imported cantaloupes as the source of a Salmonella outbreak earlier this year despite the lack of sufficient factual basis.”
 
But this week the company emailed Oregon public health to say that it would not filing suit afterall.”Obviously, it’s a relief for us that that’s withdrawn so now we can focus on the job we’re supposed to do which is to protect the public’s health,”Dr. Katrina Hedberg, state epidemiologist, to The Orgegonian.”All along we have believed that the science was solid behind this outbreak.”

 Cargill Turkey Salmonella Tops List of 2011 Antibiotic-Resistant Outbreaks 
 Posted on March 13, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
167 Americans became sick, 47 were hospitalized and one died in three major outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant foodborne illness last year, all from Salmonella in meat products, the Center for Science in the Public Interest reported.

The largest of the three outbreaks was Salmonella Heidelberg in Cargill ground turkey products, traced to the company&apos;s plant in Springdale, Arkansas. A total of 136 people in 34 states were sickened between February and September. One death was reported and 39 percent of case patients were hospitalized.

 In the next largest outbreak, Salmonella Typhimurium in ground beef sold by Hannaford Supermarkets in the Northeast sickened 20 people in seven states, sending seven to the hospital.

The third outbreak of antibiotic-resistant food poisoning was linked to Jennie-O ground turkey burgers. Salmonella Hadar infections sickened 12 people in 10 states in that outbreak. including three who were hospitalized.

All of those bacteria were resistant to treatment from several antibiotics, including drugs in the penicillin, cephalosporin, and tetracycline families.

 The CSPI report on 2011 outbreaks is part of a larger database established through literature searches of 38 foodborne outbreaks between 1973 and 2011 in which the bacteria identified were resistant to at least one antibiotic Of the 38 outbreaks, 45 percent occurred between 2000 and 2011. 

Outbreaks were most common in dairy products (12 outbreaks or 32 percent) and ground beef (10 
outbreaks or 26 percent). Four outbreaks were linked to poultry, with ground turkey appearing as a new vehicle in the two outbreaks in 2011.

The non-profit CSPI is one of several public interest groups pressing Congress to adopt a strategy to combat the rampant use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. The pervasiveness of antibiotics used to raise beef, poultry and pork is making foodborne illnesses longer, more serious and harder to treat, the group has said. 

According to FDA, the drug industry has produced more than 29 million pounds of antimicrobial drugs approved for use in food animals. CSPI says that food animals consume 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States and that 65 percent of those antibiotics are similar or identical to those used in human medicine.

 Taco Bell Lawsuits Unfold From Outbreak 
 Posted on February 22, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Taco Bell lawsuits are unfolding from the Salmonella outbreak that infected at least 68 people in 10 states. National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is an advocate for victims of this outbreak, which hit hardest in Texas and Oklahoma. A third of all case patients were hospitalized. 

To reach a Taco Bell Salmonella litigator , call PritzkerOlsen for a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 or leave your contact information and a staff attorney will call you to discuss Taco Bell food poisoning liability issues and answer any questions you might have. Our firm is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in food borne illness litigation and we have collected millions for victims of Salmonella and other types of food poisoning.

The outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis likely came from a widely distributed contaminated food product common to certain Taco Bell locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio and Tennessee . The public health investigation that began in October has not pinpointed the cause, but Taco Bell has admitted to being the restaurant that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified in the only official summary of the outbreak as the&quot;Mexican-style fast food Restaurant Chain A.&apos;&apos;

 Food Poisoning at Taco Bell  

The outbreak is believed to be over, peaking in October and November of last year, but any family or individual who is considered a case patient can bring an action for recovery of claims against Taco Bell, which has been sued successfully in the past for food borne illness outbreaks. In 2006, this national restaurant chain was identified by a federal health investigation as the center of a 5-state outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the Northeast that sickened at least 71 people. And in 2010, Taco Bell was implicated in a 21-state outbreak of Salmonella. 

In the U.S. food safety system, litigation plays an important role in holding wrongdoers accountable for food contamination that makes people sick. Many healthy adults survive Salmonella infections without seeing a doctor, but the pathogen should not be underestimated as a potential cause of severe illness or death, especially in young children, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems, including people of any age who are fighting cancer.

 Multi-State Salmonella Outbreak Assigned to Taco Bell in TX, OK, Others 
 Posted on February 2, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
A Taco Bell restaurant chain spokesperson has confirmed in an interview with Food Poisoning Bulletin that Taco Bell is&quot;Restaurant Chain A,&apos;&apos; the business associated by CDC with an outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis that sickened 68 people in 10 states. The outbreak happened in October and November, hitting hardest in Oklahoma and Texas.

 The CDC refused to say what Mexican-style restaurant chain was tied to the outbreak, partly because the illnesses stopped occurring by the time a link was made. The CDC rationalized that releasing the restaurant&apos;s name would not help anyone to avoid getting sick. The Oklahoma Department of Health broke the silence this week under public pressure and Taco Bell confirmed the news.

Investigators believe the outbreak possibly was caused by a line of produce distributed by suppliers, but traceback efforts were not successful in determing what item of produce was to blame.

Further investigation is being conducted by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.., where claims from victims can be addressed by attorneys who practice extensively in the complex area of foodborne illness litigation. Contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen or call the firm and an attorney will answer your questions. Consultations are free and you pay nothing to the firm until a claim is paid by the company or its insurance company .

More than 31 percent of patients in the Taco Bell outbreak were hospitalized. Here is the company&apos;s statement:
 
 “The CDC has stated the public health is not at any risk and this incident is completely over. They have not identified the food source of the foodborne illness that occurred in October and November of 2011. The CDC indicated that some of the people who were ill ate at Taco Bell, while others did not. They believe that the problem likely occurred at the supplier level before it was delivered to any restaurant or food outlet. We take food quality and safety very seriously.”

 CDC&apos;s Last Word on Hannaford Outbreak 
 Posted on February 1, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued its last public update on the Hannaford Supermarket ground beef Salmonella outbreak without being able to say who supplied contaminated meat to the grocery chain for the purpose of making hamburger.

 The so-called Final Investigation Update didn&apos;t even mention the agency&apos;s earlier-stated frustration over incomplete record-keeping at Hannaford in in terms of being able to tell which meatpackers supplied the beef that went into the retail chain&apos;s grinder. Without accurate grinding logs, there would be no traceback -- a process that could have potentially prevented other contaminated beef from reaching the food chain.

A total of 20 people were infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium in seven states. The outbreak started in October and is now considered over, although there is still a warning to consumers that they check their freezers for Hannaford ground beef that was recalled. The number of victims were as follows: Hawaii (1), Kentucky (1), Massachusetts (1), Maine (4), New Hampshire (6), New York (6), and Vermont (1).

 The outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium was resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics, which may have caused an increase in the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected patients. Nearly half of those who suffered infection in this outbreak were hospitalized, but there were no deaths.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is continuing to accept cases for a possible Hannaford Salmonella lawsuit. Our firm is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we are involved in practically all major outbreaks of food poisoning representing people who were harmed. Hiring a good foodborne illness attorney is important because the laws are complex and the size of claims rests on the level of experienced representation behind you and your family.

 Will The Real Mexican Style Fast Food Restaurant Please Stand Up 
 Posted on January 31, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Ever since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an after-the-fact report about a Salmonella outbreak that sickened 68 people in 10 states and withheld the name of the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain responsible, the food safety community has been buzzing. 

 Neither the CDC, nor any health official from any of the 10 states with victims has named the comany, referred to in the CDC’s first and only report on the outbreak, issued January 19, 2012, as Mexican Restaurant Chain A. 

 The CDC has a case-by-case policy in these matters and generally tries to protect companies from bad publicity by naming them only when the public can use that information to protect their health. Ih this case, neither the CDC nor any of the 10 state health departments involved said anything about the outbreak until it was over. So, in this case, the CDC’s inaction proves its own point. No, the teenager craving a taco in January can’t protect himself from becoming part of an foodborne illness outbreak that happened three months ago, but the teenager in October could have. Unfortunately, none of our public health officials gave him that opportunity. 

 And what about Restaurant Chain A? Surely Mexican Restaurant Chains B-G must be wondering why Restaurant A has lacked the courage to step up and say, yes, it’s us. Given the rumors of a possible leak later this week by one of the state departments of health, it may be time for Restaurant Chain A to let the public know that their restaurants were linked the Salmonella outbreak and to provide information on any efforts the company is making to prevent future outbreaks.

 Mexican Fast Food Salmonella Outbreak Solved With Interviews of Customers 
 Posted on January 26, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Solving the Salmonella outbreak linked to Mexican-style, fast food&quot;Restaurant Chain A&quot;in Texas, Oklahoma and eight other states took a classic, collaborative approach by a combination of federal, state and local public health agencies. Authorities have refused to identify the name of this fast-food chain to citizens.

This outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis sickened at least 68 people and now appears to be over, but any Restaurant A Salmonella lawsuit will depend on the epidemiology that convinced the FDA and CDC to conclude that some item of produce from a common source was the likely cause. National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is accepting cases from this outbreak and has represented victims of past restaurant outbreaks, collecting millions of dollars to compensate them for the harms they suffered. Free consultations for this Mexican-style fast food outbreak are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or individuals can leave contact information here and a Salmonella lawyer from the firm will call you.

 Mexican fast food Salmonella investigation 

Among 52 ill persons for whom information was available, 60 percent reported eating at Restaurant Chain A in the week before illness onset. Ill persons reported eating at 18 different locations of the chain in the week before becoming ill. Three locations were identified where more than one ill person reported eating in the week before becoming ill. This finding indicates that contamination likely occurred before the contaminated food product reached chain locations.

Further epidemiologic study based on interviews with 48 ill people and 103 who were not sick indicated that 62 percent were more likely to report eating at Restaurant Chain A in the week before illness. Only 17 percent of well respondents said they ate at the chain in the previous week. No specific food item or ingredient was found to be associated with illness due to common ingredients being used together in many menu items such as tacos, burritos, and taco salads, but 90 percent of ill respondents reported eating lettuce, 77 percent reported eating cheese and 35 percent reported eating tomatoes. Ninety four precent reported eating ground beef, but investigators discounted ground beef as a possible source of illness because of the restaurant chain&apos;s protocols for safe cooking.

 Another Salmonella Outbreak, Mexican Style 
 Posted on January 20, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella outbreak that has sickened 68 people in 10 states is the latest in a recent string of foodborne illness outbreaks linked to Mexican-style food.

On January 19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its first and final report on a multi-state Mexican fast food outbreak but did not name the restaurant chain.

Those with confirmed cases of the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis in each state is as follows: Texas (43), Oklahoma (16), Kansas (2), Iowa (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), Nebraska (1), New Mexico (1), Ohio (1), and Tennessee (1) . Investigators were unable to identify the specific food source of the outbreak, but say that the contamination likely occurred before the product reached the restaurant locations.

According to the CDC, restaurants are the most commonly identiﬁed setting for foodborne outbreaks. Recent outbreaks associated with Mexican-style restaurants include:

 A December 2011 Salmonella outbreak linked to Don Julio Mexican Restaurant in Corinth, MIss. that that sickened 59 patrons and staff. A September 2011 Salmonella outbreak linked to a Mexican restaurant in Grandville, Mich. that sickened at least one patron. Two August 2010 Salmonella outbreaks linked to a Mexican-style fast food chain that sickened at least 155 people in 18 states. 

 Salmonella is a bacteria that, if ingested, can cause an infection called salmonellosis. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported annually n the United States, but because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thirty times that number, according to the CDC.

Salmonellosis symptoms usually develop 12 to 72 hours after infection and include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps lasting four to seven days. In some cases, hospitalization is required. Those most at risk are young children, the elderly and the immunocompromised.

If you have legal questions about an illness you believe is associated with this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen P.A. for a free consultation.

 Texas, Oklahoma Hit Hard by Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Mexican Food Chain 
 Posted on January 19, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Texas and Oklahoma were hardest hit by a Salmonella outbreak that public health investigators traced to a Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain that operates in at least 11 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not name the restaurant chain in its only report on the outbreak, but it noted that 86 percent of the case patients were from Texas or Oklahoma. 

A total of 68 people were infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis, including 43 in Texas and 16 in Oklahoma. The other states with confirmed illnesses were Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa , Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, and Tennessee. About a third of the individuals were hospitalized.

 Food safety law firm PrtizkerOlsen, P.A., is prepared to help any family or individual sickened in this outbreak. Questions about possible foodborne illness litigation can be directed to any attorney at the firm, 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information and a lawyer will respond. Free case consultations are central to our practice and clients don&apos;t owe us anything until a claim is obtained for them.

 Salmonella is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne outbreaks in the United States and approximately half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings . Harms from an infection be long-lasting, at times causing a painful and disabling condition known as reactive arthritis or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. 
 
 Investigators believe the outbreak may have been caused by a contaminated produce item that arrived by truck delivery, but efforts to pinpoint the food responsible for the outbreak did not succeed. The outbreak is now over, but it spanned most of October and November and spiked in late October. 
 
It&apos;s not clear why the CDC did not name the restaurant chain, but the company&apos;s identity will become known as PritzkerOlsen investigates on behalf of outbreak victims. Anyone who contracts food poisoning at a restaurant is entitled to damages from the restaurant. This is the case even when the specific food source is not determined by health investigators or when the restaurant unknowingly accepts food already contaminated with a pathogen and serves it. Restaurants are an important filter in the U.S. food safety system. We rely on them to hand-pick suppliers that provide wholesome and unadulterated ingredients.

When restaurant owners are held accountable for making people sick, our food safety system is strengthened for the good of everyone.

 Multistate Salmonella Outbreak SIckens 68 
 Posted on January 19, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 A multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to a Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain has sickened 68 people in 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .

Almost one third of those sickened with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis required hospitalization. The number of confirmed cases in each state is as follows: Texas (43), Oklahoma (16), Kansas (2), Iowa (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), Nebraska (1), New Mexico (1), Ohio (1), and Tennessee (1). 

Among those for whom information was available, 60 percent reported eating at the fast food chain in the week before the onset of illness. Illnesses began on or after October 13, 2011. Patients ranged in age from&lt;1 to 79 years, the median age was 25. Fifty-four percent of patients were female. No deaths were reported.

A collaborative investigation by federal, state and local investigators was unable to identify a specific food associated with illness, but data indicate that contamination likely occurred before the product reached the restaurant locations.

Among the ill who reported eating at the restaurants, 90 percent reported eating lettuce, 94 percent reported eating ground beef, 77 percent reported eating cheese, and 35 percent reported eating tomatoes. This outbreak’s epidemic curve is consistent with produce-related outbreaks, according to the CDC. The restaurant’s meat handling and cooking practices make it unlikely that ground beef was the source.

 Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious illness if ingested. Symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps usually develop 12 to 72 hours after infection. In some cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized or the infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. Young children, the elderly and those with impaired immune systems are most at risk.

If you have legal questions about an illness or hospitalization associated with this outbreak, contact the foodborne illness attorneys at PritzkerOlsen P.A. for a free consultation.

 Biosafey Awareness was Lacking at Labs Where Salmonella Outbreak Hit Hardest 
 Posted on January 19, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
Commercially available Salmonella latched onto the lab coats, pens, keys, cell phones, mp3 players and whatnot of microbiology students and workers in an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium that sickened more than 100 people in 38 states, killing one.

 In a final report on the year-long outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week reported a correlation between illness and a lack of biosafety training and awareness. Minnesota and Pennsylvania led the country with nine illnesses each while Georgia had six cases and the state of Washington had five. Several states had four case patients.

The illnesses began showing up in late August 2010 and the outbreak lasted through June 2011. Among those sickened by the organism were children at the homes of lab students and workers -- proof that the pathogen traveled on objects needlessly taken into a laboratory or on lab clothing that should only have left the facility for laundering.

The link between illness and lack of biosafety awareness and training was found in professional surveys among varying groups of lab workers and students.

&quot;Staff working at laboratories that were associated with illness were less likely to have knowledge of biosafety training materials,&apos;&apos; the CDC report said.&quot;In comparison, staff working in laboratories that were not associated with illness were more likely to train students and staff on the signs and symptoms of infection with Salmonella when conducting safety training.&apos;&apos;

The CDC report included advice to students, lab workers and lab managers. One piece of advice for managers is to use either non-pathogenic or attenuated bacterial strains when possible, especially when teaching.

 Hannaford Ignored Meat-Handling Guidelines 
 Posted on January 18, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
 Hannaford Supermarkets, which has been linked to the ground beef Salmonella outbreak that has sickened 19 people in seven states, ignored longstanding federal recommendations on minimizing food safety hazards in raw ground meat.

 First published in 1998  by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) , Guidance for Beef Grinders and Suppliers of Boneless Beef and Trim Products   states that grinders should“prevent any mixing of product from different suppliers”and should maintain records detailed enough“to identify, trace, and retrieve from commerce any ground beef products that may pose a threat to public health.”

 After opening an investigation to pinpoint the original source of the outbreak linked to meat produced at Hannaford Supermarkets, the USDA found that the company’s inadequate records and practice of packaging ground meat from multiple suppliers mired traceback efforts. 

 This situation is precisely what the agency has hoped to avoid by publishing and republishing beef grinding guidelines over the last 15 years. Although following USDA guidelines is not required under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, doing so can minimize  the impact of food safety hazards associated with raw ground meat. For example, t he three basic principles of the grinding guidelines are:
 
 “First, grinders and their suppliers should address hazards from pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in their raw materials, as they are responsible under HACCP to identify and address all hazards reasonably likely to occur.  

 •Second, grinders and their suppliers should realize that they are in an excellent position to implement process and distribution controls that address public health hazards associated with ground beef, such as E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella .  
 
 •Third, there must be an emphasis throughout the production and distribution chain on  maintaining the records that are necessary to identify, trace, and retrieve from commerce any ground beef products that may pose a threat to public health.“ 
 
 One section explains why keeping products from different suppliers separate is important: 
 
 “Grinders receiving product from more than one supplier should prevent any mixing of product from different suppliers. Keeping product from different suppliers separate will prevent any potentially E. coli O157:H7-contaminated source material from adulterating source materials from other suppliers. By separating raw materials from different suppliers, grinders will be able to identify the potential source of any E. coli O157:H7-contaminated product should the pathogen be detected. If ground beef produced from raw materials coming from a supplier is confirmed positive for E. coli O157:H7, FSIS intends to notify the supplier that they may have supplied E .coli O157:H7-positive product to a grinding establishment or retail facility.”  
 
 Another guidance,  Sanitation Guidance For Beef Grinders , issued last week, gives examples of how to keep good records:, 

 Good records include: 

 1. Producing store name 

 2. Address 

 3. City/state/zip 

 4. Date of each lot of store ground product produced, where a lot is defined as all  

 identically labeled product produced from full equipment clean-up to clean-up 

 5. Exact name/type of store ground product 

 6. Amount of each lot of store ground product 

 7. Sell by/use by date and/or production code of each lot of store ground product 

 8. Other information used to identify store ground product 

 9. Full name(s) and product code(s) of all source products used to formulate each lot  

 of store ground product 

 10. All Federal or State Establishment numbers of each source product contained in  

 each lot of store ground product 

 11. Each source product sell by, use by, or production date/code   

 12. The source firm name, establishment number and use by/sell by/production  

 date/code for all Shop trim/rework used in each lot of store ground product 

 13. Date and Time the grinder was sanitized between source materials 

 14. Bills of Sale (e.g. sales receipts) reflecting Item numbers for each ground beef  

 product sold to consumers 

 15. Invoice(s) and Bill(s) of lading for source product(s)  

 
 

 Grinding Record 

 
 

 Time of grind 

 Lot/Batch Number (lot=same source material) 

 Exact Name/Type of Product Produced 

 Package Size of Product Produced 

 Amount (in pounds) produced 

 Production Code of Product of Product Produced 

 Manufacturer, Name of Source Material Used 

 Supplier, Product Code and/or Pack Date of Source Material Used 

 Establishment Information from label of Source Product Used (Est. #, ph #, contact info)

 Hannaford Ground Beef Salmonella Update 
 Posted on January 17, 2012 by PritzkerLaw Food poisoning experts who have studied the timeline in the Hannaford ground beef Salmonella outbreak say it is similar to past outbreaks where up to three new cases per month are detected through molecular review of Salmonella infections by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By that analysis, the number of people sickened by now could be approaching 25. The states hardest hit have been New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts .  Because the meat in question was sold over a long time period -- from at least October 12 to mid-December -- officials continue to urge consumers to check their home freezers for recalled Hannaford ground beef products and not eat them. Restaurant and food service operators should not serve it. Click here for full details of the Hannaford ground beef recall . Packages have sell-by dates of December 17, 2011, or earlier. Epidemiologists in Maine and New York have confirmed by testing product found in the homes of two ill people that hamburger in recalled packages is contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium. This strain is resistant to multiple antibiotics, which may be associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals. Nearly half of case patients have been hospitalized. From October 8 through December 17, a total of 19 people were confirmed as victims in this outbreak. The latest CDC update said the pattern associated with illness in this outbreak has been seen before and in the past typically caused 0-3 cases per month. By that measure, the detection system operated by the CDC in conjunction with state and local health departments and physicians around the country likely has confirmed at least 22 cases by now, maybe more. Most persons infected with Salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness from Salmonella infection. If you or a loved one has legal questions about claims, liability and a possible Hannaford Salmonella lawsuit , contact a lawyer at food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information an an attorney will call you.

 CDC Declares Chicken Liver Salmonella Outbreak Over 
 Posted on January 12, 2012 by PritzkerLaw 
After sickening 190 people in six states, the Salmonella  outbreak l inked to kosher broiled chicken livers from Schreiber Processing Corp. is over, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 

 The outbreak, which peaked during the summer, stemmed from labeling confusion. The packaging described the product as &quot;kosher broiled chicken livers,&quot;but the product was not ready-to-eat and required further cooking before eating. 

 Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked this outbreak to eating&quot;kosher broiled chicken livers&quot;from Schreiber Processing Corporation (doing business as Alle Processing Corporation/MealMart Company), and chopped chicken liver prepared from this product.  

 

 Among 39 ill persons for whom information is available, 28 (72%) reported consuming chicken liver products in the week before their illness began. Laboratory testing conducted by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Laboratory Division identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg in samples of“kosher broiled chicken livers”and chopped liver products obtained from retail stores.  

 On November 8, 2011, Schreiber Processing Corporation, of Maspeth, N.Y., York, announced a recall of an undetermined amount of“kosher broiled chicken liver”products. The products were sold at retail stores and may have been used as ingredients in other prepared foods.  

 The outbreak hit New York the hardest with 109 people falling ill after eating the tainted livers. Illnesses in other states were as follows: New Jersey (62), Pennsylvania (10), Maryland (6), Ohio (2), and Minnesota (1). 

 Among persons for whom information is available in in these states, those sickened ranged in age from&lt;1 to 97 years with a median age of 14 years. Forty-nine percent were female. Among the 154 ill persons with available information, 30 (19%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. 

 Salmonella poisoning, or salmonellosis, can have long-term effects including reactive arthritis which can cause heart complications or problems in the eyes, bones, or joints.

 Hannaford Salmonella Outbreak Expands 
 Posted on December 31, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 At least two more people have been infected with Salmonella Typhimurium in the outbreak associated with recalled Hannaford ground beef sold in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is investigating the outbreak and will provide free case consultations to individuals or families who have been hospitalized or suffered gastrointestinal illness caused by the outbreak strain of Salmonella . Our law firm is one of the very few in the United States practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning.

 Eighteen people in at least seven states have been stricken by the pathogen linked to Hannaford hamburger and health officials continue to urge consumers to check their freezers for packages covered by the recall.  The various ground beef packages bear sell-by dates of December. 17, 2011, or earlier. Hannaford store brand meat, Nature&apos;s Place ground beef and Taste of Inspirations Angus ground beef are all part of the recall. See complete details of the Hannaford hamburger recall . 

Some of those sickened in the outbreak ate food made with Salmonella -contaminated beef at a Hannaford store. If the store had adequately cooked the beef, no one would have become ill. In cases like this, we have pursued claims of negligence, but ground beef litigation against Hannaford will also cover people sickened by packaged ground beef used at home.

One of the issues in this outbreak is the USDA&apos;s inability so far to identify the supplier of contaminated beef, which may have been sold to other retailers. Many retail chains grind their own hamburger from cuts and trim they obtain from various suppliers and Hannaford&apos;s grinding records are limited, impeding the traceback investigation, the USDA has said.

 Salmonella Lawyer Supports Petition Calling for USDA to ban ABR Salmonella 
 Posted on December 21, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A legal petition filed in May with the United States Department of Agriculture urges the agency to prohibit four types of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in ground meat and poultry. One of those strains, Salmonella Typhimurium, is the bacteria causing an outbreak of illness in the Northeast that federal investigators have associated with store-ground hamburger from Hannaford supermarkets. Click here for details on the Hannaford ground beef Salmonella recall.  

 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys supports the petition filed by nonprofit consumer watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) . Our firm is investigating the Hannaford outbreak and has been in touch with victims. More than half of the 16 people confirmed so far as case patients have been hospitalized. To contact a Salmonella lawyer at our firm, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) for a free case consultation. Our firm is one of the very few U.S. legal groups that is practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions of dollars for food poisoning victims across the country.

 The Hannaford recall and outbreak has prompted CSPI to amplify its call for action from the USDA. Dangerous strains of Salmonella in meat are making foodborne illnesses harder to treat. CSPI wants the USDA to declare four such strains as&quot;adulterants,&apos;&apos; making products that contain them illegal to sell. E. coli O157:H7 already holds that status when present in ground beef. The declaration would trigger enhanced testing and could minimize their entry into commerce.&quot;Adulterant&quot;status also would force greater accountability on wrongdoers in foodborne illness litigation stemming from outbreaks. 

Antibiotic-resistant pathogens may be associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.The three other Salmonella strains covered by the petition, Salmonella Heidelberg, Salmonella Newport, and Salmonella Hadar have all been linked to outbreaks.

 Maine, New Hampshire and New York Leading in Hannaford Salmonella Cases 
 Posted on December 20, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Maine, New Hampshire and New York are the leading states in the Hannaford ground beef Salmonella outbreak when it comes to the number of people who have been infected and confirmed as case patients. In its first detailed report on the outbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said each of the three Northeast states is home to four confirmed cases, or three-fourths of the total number of 16 illnesses. 

The CDC said four other states each have one case: Hawaii, Massachusetts, Kentucky and Vermont. More than half of those stricken from the contaminated ground beef have been hospitalized, starting in October.

&quot;CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill,&apos;&apos; the CDC said in its report.

It was patient interviews that first led the USDA and other investigators to associate the outbreak with fresh ground beef sold by the Hannaford supermarket chain. Due to insufficient grinding logs kept by Hannaford, however, the investigation has failed to identify the meatpacker that is responsible for supplying containinated raw cuts and trim that the retailer mixed into hamburger.

The Hannaford ground beef recall involves packages that have sell-by dates of December 17 or earlier. Click here for details on the S almonella ground beef recall.

 Mississippi Don Julio&apos;s Reopens Following Salmonella Illness Outbreak in Corinth 
 Posted on December 20, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Mississippi State Department of Health has approved a food safety improvement plan from the Don Julio Mexican Restaurant in Corinth following a Salmonella outbreak that sickened 59 patrons and staff.

Liz Sharlot from the Health Department told djournal.com that Don Julio&apos;s has reopened after being shut down since December 8. The agency noted in a press release that its investigation showed the cause of the outbreak appeared to be isolated at the restaurant rather than being linked to an outside food producer or supplier .

If you or a loved one has been sickened in this outbreak, you have every right to consult with an experienced foodborne illness attorney about pursuing a claim. Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen Attorneys are investigating and accepting cases. Free case consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or leave your contact information and a lawyer will call you. Our firm is one of the very few U.S. legal groups practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions of dollars for Salmonella victims across the country -- handling their cases from start to finish.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), restaurants are the
most commonly identiﬁed setting for foodborne outbreaks. Previous studies have shown that as many as 45 percent of confirmed food poisoning outbreaks reported to the CDC occurred in restaurants. Given that 80 percent of Americans eat out at least once per week, we need a better understanding of how and why food poisoning is transmitted in restaurants in order to develop better prevention measures.

In addition to serving victims of these outbreaks, Pritzker Olsen is actively involved in various causes and projects to prevent foodborne illness. Currently, one in six Americans each year gets sick from contaminated food.

 Cargill Ground Turkey Salmonella Update 
 Posted on December 19, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Cargill ground turkey production has resumed in Sprindale, Arkansas, for the first time since a multi-state Salmonella outbreak prompted the shut down of the operation for food safety purposes. The Minnesota-based company made the announcement in a press release this week.
 
 &quot;One of four ground turkey production lines has been reactivated at Springdale and the other three will be reactivated over the coming weeks as part of a multiphase ramp-up of production,&apos;&apos; the company said. 
 
The 2011 Cargill turkey  Salmonella outbreak involved a multi-drug resistant strain of Salmonella Heidelberg that sickened at least 136 persons in 34 states. Illinois and Michigan had the most cases and the CDC outbreak investigation spanned from late February through mid-September.

Cargill said it took the following actions to make the Arkansas plant safe:

 Complete reassessment and overhaul of the facility’s food safety plan. Implementation of several new food safety measures, including more and better bacterial reduction steps throughout the process. Creation of a three-phase ground turkey sampling and monitoring program which is the most rigorous in the industry. Use of high pressure processing to reduce Salmonella. Development of an enhanced process control monitoring system to ensure all aspects of the company’s Salmonella control program are continuously generating the best possible results.

 Hannaford Ground Beef Outbreak Raises Food Safety Record Keeping Issue 
 Posted on December 18, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Northeast Salmonella outbreak associated with Hannaford supermarket ground beef has raised an old issue with federal meat investigators. The USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) notes in its five-state Hannaford recall notice that the probe of where the problem started has been impeded by&quot;limited&apos;&apos; meat grinding records at Hannaford.

 

 

 Retailers are not currently required to maintain detailed grinding logs that would show what beef cuts and trim go into each batch of store-made hamburger. The Hannaford Salmonella recall notice makes a reference to the issue and notes that FSIS is&quot;pursuing rulemaking to address the concern.&apos;&apos; Detailed logs stating the identities of raw beef suppliers are needed for tracebacks to the original source of contamination to stop recurring outbreaks and expand recalls to protect as many consumers as possible. 

 

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys supports the additional regulation and is currently investigating the Hannaford outbreak in Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and New York. At least seven people have been hospitalized and seven more have confirmed illnesses all caused by infections of Salmonella Typhimurium, a bacteria that is resistant to some types of antibiotics. If you or a loved one has been injured in this outbreak, call an experienced foodborne illness lawyer who understands the complexities of infectious disease and who is liable for them when the agent of illness is ground beef sold by a multi-state supermarket chain.

 Don Julio Mexican Restaurant Is Source of Mississippi Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on December 14, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in Corinth, Miss. has been linked to Don Julio Mexican Restaurant and is no longer and ongoing public health threat, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH ) said yesterday.

 &quot;Our investigation has shown that the incident does not appear to be a food producer or supplier issue,&quot;Northeast Mississippi District Health Officer Dr. Jessie R. Taylor, said in a statement.&quot;It appears to be an isolated problem with this particular restaurant, and the restaurant is working closely with us to correct the problem.&quot;

The restaurant, which has been closed since December 8, will remain closed until an improvement plan is approved by the MSDH.

 As of December 13, a total of 59 patrons and employees of Don Julio Mexican Restaurant in Corinth, had positive cultures confirming the presence of Salmonella . MSDH has notified area healthcare providers.

 Salmonella is a bacteria that, if ingested, causes salmonellosis an infection that can be serious and sometimes fatal. Children are the most likely to get salmonellosis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than five years old is higher than the rate for all other age groups.

 

Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment,according to the CDC. In some cases, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient requires hospitalization. In these cases, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

Anyone with legal questions about an illness related to this outbreak can contact the foodborne illness lawyers at PritzkerOlsen P.A. for a free consultation.

 Posted on December 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Health officials are investigating twenty-two cases of Salmonella poisoning in Corinth, Mississippi. Investigators are looking at restaurants where those sickened reported eating. According to the Sun Herald , Don Julio&apos;s was closed on Thursday: 
 
Health officials had found no evidence of any food contamination at the restaurant, and it was not ordered to close, a sign on the door said.

However, concern about contamination of vegetables from a supplier and the safety of customers prompted the move. 
 
 Salmonella is generally transmitted by food contaminated with the bacterium. Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning generally include severe diarrhea and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, headache and muscle pain. In some cases there is blood in the stool. 

 Salmonella can be fatal if the infection enters the bloodstream.

 Salmonella Outbreak in Corinth, MIss. 
 Posted on December 7, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Magnolia Regional Health Center in Corinth, Miss. has received 11 positive Salmonella cultures since Nov. 28, according to the Associated Press.

Hospital CEO Nick Napper says some cases have been admitted to the hospital and are in stable condition, that the state health department has been notified and that a source has not yet been identified, according to a story in the Daily Corinthian.

State health officials have interviewed the patients, and taken food samples from local restaurant, according to the Sun Herald. No restaurants have been closed by the state.

 Salmonella is bacteria that can cause salmonellosis , an infection resulting in fever, cramps and diarrhea that lasts for several days and can require hospitalization. For some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the salmonellosis may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites. Salmonellosis can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

If you have legal questions about an illness or a hospitalization associated with this outbreak, contact the the foodborne illness attorneys at PritzkerOlsen for a free consultation.

Salmonellosis Complications

Salmonella infections can be life-threatening especially for infants and young children, pregnant women and their unborn babies, and older adults, who are at a higher risk for foodborne illness, as are people with weakened immune systems. We have handled cases for Salmonella victims who developed Reiter&apos;s syndrome , a reactive arthritis.

 Cargill&apos;s Federal Contracts In Jeopardy After Allegations of Discrimination Arise 
 Posted on November 30, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Allegations of discriminatory hiring practices at Cargill’s Springdale, Arkansas meat-packing plant have prompted federal officials to say they want to cancel existing contracts with and prevent future ones with the Minnepaolis-based food conglomerate.

 Cargill Meat Solutions systematically discriminated against more than 4,000 female, white, black, Hispanic and Native American qualified applicants seeking entry-level production jobs at the Springdale facility, according to an administrative complaint filed with the department&apos;s Office of Administrative Law Judges.

The complaint was filed after he U.S. Department of Labor&apos;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program (OFCCP) was unable to secure a fair resolution from Cargill Meat Solutions to pay back wages and interest to the rejected job applicants and extend job offers to at least 167 of the affected workers.
 
&quot;This is an unfortunate case in which thousands of qualified workers were denied the opportunity to compete fairly for jobs in a tough economy,&quot;OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu, said in a statement.&quot;Cargill has discriminated against vulnerable workers. OFCCP is prepared to use every tool at our disposal, including canceling a company&apos;s federal contracts when necessary, to achieve the goal of equal opportunity for workers.&quot;
 
The allegations add to the woes of the Springdale plant which was linked earlier this year to a Salmonella outbreak. Ground turkey processed at the plant sickened 136 people in 34 states between February and September, forced the temporary closure of the plant and prompted the largest meat recall in U.S. history

 179 Confirmed Cases of Salmonella Heidelberg Linked to Chicken Livers and Chopped Liver in NY, NJ, PA, MD, OH and MN 
 Posted on November 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 From April 1 to November 16, 2011, a total of 179 illnesses due to Salmonella Heidelberg with the same  PFGE pattern were reported in states where Schreiber Processing Company“kosher broiled chicken livers”were distributed: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Florida. With the chicken liver products, Schreiber Processing Corporation was doing business as Alle Processing Corporation/ MealMart Company. Some of the meat was distributed to retailers under the MealMart brand.

People contracted Salmonella Heidelberg after eating the chicken livers or chopped liver made from the chicken livers. Some people were sickened after eating the product at home, and others, at grocery stores or other locations. In all cases, victims have a claim against Schreiber Processing for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering compensation, and other damages. 

The number of people who contracted Salmonella Heidelberg from chicken livers as follows: New York (99), New Jersey (61), Pennsylvania (10), Maryland (6), Ohio (2), and Minnesota (1). Among persons for whom information is available in in these states, ill persons range in age from&lt;1 to 97 years with a median age of 13 years. Forty-nine percent are female. Among the 126 ill persons with available information, 25 (20%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Salmonella Heidelberg Outbreak Investigation

 Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked this outbreak to eating“kosher broiled chicken livers”from Schreiber Processing Corporation (doing business as Alle Processing Corporation/MealMart Company), and chopped chicken liver prepared from this product. These“kosher broiled chicken livers”are sold at retail stores and may be used as an ingredient in other prepared foods. These products appear to be ready-to-eat, but are in fact partially cooked, and therefore need to be fully cooked before eating. Consumers may have incorrectly thought the use of the word“broiled”in the label meant the chicken liver was ready-to-eat; however, these chicken livers must be fully cooked before eating.

Among 37 ill persons for whom information is available, 25 (68%) reported consuming chicken liver products in the week before their illness began. Laboratory testing conducted by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Laboratory Division identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg in samples of“kosher broiled chicken livers”and chopped liver products obtained from retail stores. In addition, New York City health officials found the outbreak strain was found in“kosher broiled chicken liver”products.

 Attorney Fred Pritzker Files Lawsuit against Wegmans on Behalf of Pine Nut Salmonella Victim 
 Posted on November 16, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a victim of the multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to Turkish pine nuts sold at grocery stores operated by Wegmans Food Markets, Inc., of Rochester, N.Y., and distributed by Sunrise Commodities, of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The lawsuit against Wegmans and Sunrise Commodities was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Monroe County by PritzkerOlsen with local counsel.

In September 2011, the plaintiff purchased pine nuts at Wegmans and made basil pesto with them. After eating the pesto, she began to suffer weakness, abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. Her condition worsened, and she was later admitted to the hospital. 

The plaintiff was one of at least 42 people in five states who contracted a Salmonella infection after eating the pine nuts, according to the CDC . Most of the victims, 27 of them, are from New York. There are also eight victims from Pennsylvania, four from Virginia, two from New Jersey and one from Maryland.

“This outbreak was caused by a breakdown in the food safety systems designed to protect consumers”said food safety attorney Fred Pritzker . “After-the-fact testing conclusively proved that the Turkish pine nuts were adulterated with Salmonella Enteritidis. Had these companies properly tested the product in the first place, this outbreak would not have occurred.”

Public health investigators used DNA“fingerprints”of the Salmonella strain to identify cases of illness that were part of this outbreak. After laboratory testing linked the illnesses to pine nuts sold in bulk bins at Wegmans grocery stores, the company issued a recall of 5,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts sold at 78 stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland between July 1 and October 18, 2011.

Further tests by the FDA confirmed that Salmonella matching the outbreak strain was present on samples of Turkish pine nuts taken from a warehouse used by Sunrise Commodities. The recall was then expanded to include pine nuts that had been distributed to food vendors in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Canada.

 Attorneys Fred Pritzker and Ryan Osterholm represent the plaintiff in this case. They can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or at http://www.salmonellaclaimcenter.com or  www.pritzkerlaw.com . PritzkerOlsen, P.A. has offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

 Schreiber Processing-MealMart Should Pay Medical Bills of Salmonella Victims Sickened by the Company&apos;s Chicken Livers 
 Posted on November 14, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella lawyers at Pritzker Olsen law firm, are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg linked to eating“kosher broiled chicken livers”from Schreiber Processing Corporation (doing business as Alle Processing Corporation/MealMart Company), and chopped chicken liver prepared from this product. They are calling on Schreiber Processing to pay victims’medical bills.

 

“We are calling on Schreiber Processing to pay the medical bills of the  Salmonella  victims immediately,”said food poisoning attorney Fred Pritzker .“These victims and their families deserve this much while they are waiting for further compensation from the companies for lost income, pain and suffering, emotional distress and other damages.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention :

Among 30 ill persons for whom information is available, 22 (73%) reported consuming chicken liver products in the week before their illness began. Laboratory testing conducted by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Laboratory Division identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg in samples of“kosher broiled chicken livers”and chopped liver products obtained from retail stores.

This microbiological evidence is the“smoking gun”implicating Schreiber Processing/ MealMart chicken livers as the source of the outbreak that has sickened people in New Jersey, New York and possibly in other states.

In response to this Salmonella outbreak linked to chicken livers , Schreiber Processing Corporation, a Maspeth, N.Y. establishment, recalled an undetermined amount of broiled chicken liver products that had been distributed to retail stores and institutional users in Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Visit Pritzker Olsen law firm’s Salmonella Claim Center for a list of retailers.

 Attorney Fred Pritzker can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by submitting our free consultation form . Mr. Pritzker represents Salmonella victims nationwide. He has won millions for food poisoning victims and has appeared on national and local news programs to discuss foodborne illness lawsuits and food safety. He is listed in the current edition of The Best Lawyers in America.

 CDC Updates Numbers for Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Cargill Ground Turkey 
 Posted on November 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The CDC has released updated information on the Salmonella outbreak linked to ground turkey processed by Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas. A total of 136 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg were reported from 34 states with illness onset dates between February 27 and September 13, 2011. The number of ill persons identified in each state was as follows: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Arizona (3), California (7), Colorado (4), Connecticut (1), Georgia (2), Illinois (16), Indiana (2), Iowa (2), Kansas (3), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (4), Maryland (1), Michigan (12), Minnesota (2), Mississippi (2), Missouri (7), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New Jersey (1), New York (3), North Carolina (4), Ohio (12), Oklahoma (2), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (8), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (2), Texas (18), Utah (1), Vermont (1), and Wisconsin (4).

 

Among persons for whom information was available, illnesses began on or after February 27, 2011. Ill persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 90 years old, with a median age of 23 years old. Fifty-five percent were male. Among the 94 ill persons with available information, 37 (39%) were hospitalized. One death was reported.

Evidence Implicating Cargill Ground Turkey

 Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal public health and regulatory agencies indicated that ground turkey was the likely source of this outbreak.

Among the 94 ill persons with available information, 51 (54%) reported consuming ground turkey. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy persons in which 11% of persons interviewed reported consuming ground turkey in the 7 days before they were interviewed. Product information (such as date and location of purchase of ground turkey) was collected from ill persons and was used by local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies to further the investigation.

Cultures of five ground turkey samples purchased from five retail locations between March 7 and June 27, 2011, yielded Salmonella Heidelberg with the outbreak strain. PFGE patterns from these Salmonella bacteria were added to the PulseNet database between April 11 and July 12, approximately a month after each sample was collected. Preliminary information indicated that all of these products originated from a common food-production establishment (Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas). These products were obtained as part of routine sampling in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)  and were not linked to illnesses. In addition, a sample of leftover, unlabeled frozen ground turkey was collected by public health officials from the home of an ill person infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg in Ohio. Culture of the ground turkey sample yielded the outbreak strain on July 29, 2011.

In addition to the outbreak strain, with the“initial”PGFE pattern, a Salmonella Heidelberg with a second closely related PFGE pattern was identified in the contaminated leftover product. Since February 27, 2011, a total of 27 ill persons have been reported to PulseNet with this closely related PGFE pattern. Among the 13 such patients who have been interviewed, 12 (92%) reported consumption of ground turkey in the week before their illness began. The closely related PGFE pattern was also found in a retail sample of ground turkey taken as part of NARMS surveillance. This retail sample originated from Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation establishment in Springdale, Arkansas. Based on these findings, the 27 ill persons with this second closely related PFGE pattern of Salmonella Heidelberg were included in the total count of outbreak cases.

Drug Resistant Strain of Salmonella Heidelberg

This was a multi-drug resistant strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. As of September 12, 2011, investigators collected antibiotic resistance information on isolates from 12 samples of ground turkey collected at retail and from 23 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. The isolates from the ground turkey samples were resistant to antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin. The sensitivity testing results indicated that isolates from humans were also resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, and some were resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin. All human isolates were sensitive to several common antibiotics used in clinical practice such as ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antimicrobial resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

Cargill Ground Turkey Recall

On August 3, 2011, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation, a Springdale, Arkansas, establishment, recalled approximately 36 million pounds of ground turkey products that may have been contaminated with a multi-drug resistant strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. The products subject to recall were all comprised of ground turkey meat and had the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection.

On September 11, 2011, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation recalled another 185,000 pounds of ground turkey products after product samples at the plant tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg based on sample results from an intensive in-plant investigation performed by FSIS. On September 27, 2011 FSIS reported that one positive sample was confirmed to have the outbreak strain and the isolate was multidrug resistant.

 Salmonella Heidelberg Infections Linked to Chicken Livers from Schreiber Processing Corporation 
 Posted on November 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 From April 1 to November 4, 2011, a total of 157 Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses linked to kosher&quot;broiled&quot;chicken livers processed by Schreiber Processing Corporation of New York were reported in New York (93 cases - 56 of the cases in NYC) and New Jersey (64 cases). Among persons for whom information is available in New York and New Jersey, illnesses began on or after March 13, 2011. Ill persons range in age from&lt;1 to 97 years with a median age of 10 years. Fifty-two percent are female. Among the 125 ill persons with available information, 21 (17%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Cases in Maryland and Pennsylvania have also been reported, but the CDC still has to analyze data on these cases before they are included in the CDC count. We expect Salmonella Heidelberg cases from additional states will also be part of this outbreak.

Evidence Implicating Chicken Livers as the Outbreak Source

Epidemiologic and microbiological evidence has linked this Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak to eating“kosher broiled chicken livers”from Schreiber Processing Corporation (doing business as Alle Processing Corporation/MealMart Company), and chopped chicken liver prepared from this product:

 Epidemiological Evidence : Among 30 ill persons for whom information is available, 22 (73%) reported consuming chicken liver products in the week before their illness began.

 Microbiological Evidence : Laboratory testing conducted by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Laboratory Division identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg in samples of“kosher broiled chicken livers”and chopped liver products obtained from retail stores.

Recall Information

On November 8, 2011, Schreiber Processing Corporation, of Maspeth, New York, announced a recall of an undetermined amount of“kosher broiled chicken liver”products. These“kosher broiled chicken livers”are sold at retail stores and may be used as an ingredient in other prepared foods. These products appear to be ready-to-eat, but are in fact partially cooked, and therefore need to be fully cooked before eating. Consumers may have incorrectly thought the use of the word“broiled”in the label meant the chicken liver was ready-to-eat; however, these chicken livers must be fully cooked before eating.

The products subject to recall include:

 10 lb. boxes with two, 5 lb. bags of“Meal Mart Broiled Chicken Liver; Made for Further Thermal Processing” 10 lb. boxes of loose packed“Chicken Liver Broiled” 

Each bag or box bears the establishment number“P-787″inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was distributed to retail stores and institutional users in Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

 NJ Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Chicken Livers 
 Posted on November 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 

A Salmonella outbreak linked to kosher broiled chicken livers from Schreiber Processing Corporation has sickened at least 64 people in New Jersey, according to the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS).

The majority of the cases have occurred in Ocean County. About 11 percent of the patients have required hospitalization, 48 percent are female, Donna Leusner, the department&apos;s spokeswoman, told CIDRAP News.

Chicken livers and chicken liver products, sold under the MealMart brand, are labeled“broiled”and appear cooked but are not. DHSS, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have identified these cases of illness associated with the Salmonella Heidelberg bacteria strain, a common bacteria associated with food poisoning in humans.

The cases of  Salmonella  Heidelberg, identified during the period of February through November, all had a common DNA fingerprint. Public health investigations recognized a pattern of people reporting that they ate kosher broiled chicken livers or chopped liver before their illness began. The same Salmonella strain has been found in samples of broiled chicken livers and in samples of chopped liver made from the kosher broiled chicken livers.

In stores, broiled chicken livers are often re-packaged and sold in smaller quantities. Retail stores and other establishments in the following communities either re-packaged this product or used it to prepare chopped liver that was sold to customers:

 New Jersey:   Moonachie, Englewood, Lakewood, Freehold, Teaneck, Elizabeth, Howell,Highland Park, Passaic, Paterson New York:     Bronx, Brooklyn, Cedarhurst, Far Rockaway, Ferndale, Flushing, Kew Gardens Lawrence, Loch Sheldrake, Monsey, New York (Manhattan), Ocean Side, Parksville, Roslyn Heights, Schenectady, South Fallsberg, Suffern, Wesley Hills, Woodridge. Maryland:       Baltimore Pennsylvania:  Mckeesrocks, Philadelphia Minnesota:      New Hope 

Consuming food contaminated with Salmonella can cause an infection called salmonellosis which can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, infants and the elderly. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Anyone who ate meat included in this recall and develops symptoms should seek medical attention.

Anyone with legal questions about an illness associated with this outbreak should contact the Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen P.A., a national leader in foodborne illness, for a free consultation by clicking here or calling toll free 1 (888) 377-8900.

 Tainted Chicken Livers Sicken 89 In New York 
 Posted on November 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 

A Salmonella outbreak associated with tainted chicken livers has sickened 89 New Yorkers, according to a press release from the New York Department of Health.

 Schreiber Processing Corporation of Maspeth, NY, announced a recall of an undetermined amount of broiled chicken liver and chopped liver products on November 8. The chicken products, sold under the MealMart brand, were labeled&quot;broiled&quot;and appeared pre-cooked but were only partially cooked and needed to be fully cooked before consumption.

In New York City, 56 cases have been reported, an additional 33 cases in nine upstate counties have also been linked to the outbreak.

Officials from New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets have isolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg from samples of broiled chicken livers from the establishment, and chopped chicken livers produced at retail locations. 

The products subject to recall include:

 10 lb. boxes with two, 5 lb. bags of&quot;Meal Mart Broiled Chicken Liver; Made for Further Thermal Processing&quot; 10 lb. boxes of loose packed&quot;Chicken Liver Broiled&quot; 

Each bag or box bears the establishment number&quot;P-787&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was distributed to retail stores and institutional users in Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and Rhode Island. 

Consuming food contaminated with Salmonella can cause an infection called salmonellosis which can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, infants and the elderly. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Anyone who ate meat included in this recall and develops symptoms should seek medical attention.

 New York City Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Chicken Livers and Chopped Liver 
 Posted on November 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The New York City Health Department has identified 56 cases of Salmonella Heidelberg food poisoning in New York City that are linked to eating MealMart brand kosher broiled chicken livers from the Schreiber Processing Corporation that were not cooked. Even though the chicken livers are labeled as“broiled”and may appear cooked, chicken livers from this manufacturer are not thoroughly cooked and should not be eaten unless they are cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

 Salmonella illness ( salmonellosis ) has also been linked to chopped liver made from this uncooked product. Chopped liver made by the consumer after purchasing this product should also be fully cooked before consuming or discarded.

Cases of illness have also been identified in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Minnesota.

MealMart has issued a recall of this product. The products subject to recall include:

 10 lb. boxes with two, 5 lb. bags of&quot;Meal Mart Broiled Chicken Liver; Made for Further Thermal Processing&quot; 10 lb. boxes of loose packed&quot;Chicken Liver Broiled&quot; 

Each bag or box bears the establishment number&quot;P-787&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was distributed to retail stores and institutional users in Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.

The New York City Salmonella Outbreak Investigation

The Health Department recognized a pattern of people reporting that they ate kosher broiled chicken livers or chopped liver before their illness began and this past week confirmed that the cases of Salmonella Heidelberg identified during the period of February through November 2011 had a common DNA“fingerprint.”Of the 56 people who were diagnosed with infection from this Salmonella strain, 12 were hospitalized. This Salmonella strain has been found in samples of kosher broiled chicken livers and in samples of chopped liver made from the same broiled chicken liver produced by MealMart Company in Maspeth, N.Y. Though consumers reported that they believed the product to be fully cooked, it is not safe to eat without additional cooking.

In stores,“broiled chicken livers”are often re-packaged and sold in smaller quantities or are used to prepare chopped liver sold at deli-style establishments. Retail stores and other establishments in the following communities may have either re-packaged this product or used it to prepare chopped liver that was sold to customers:

 New York: Bronx, Brooklyn, Cedarhurst, Far Rockaway, Ferndale, Flushing, Kew Gardens, Lawrence, Loch Sheldrake, Monsey, New York (Manhattan), Ocean Side, Parksville, Roslyn Heights, Schenectady, South Fallsberg, Suffern, Wesley Hills, Woodridge New Jersey: Elizabeth, Englewood, Freehold, Highland Park, Howell, Lakewood, Moonachie, Passaic, Paterson, Teaneck Pennsylvania: Mckeesrocks, Philadelphia Maryland: Baltimore Minnesota: New Hope

 Chicken Liver Causes Salmonella Heidelberg Outbreak in New Jersey and New York 
 Posted on November 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 An outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland has been linked to broiled chicken liver products processed by Schreiber Processing Corporation of Maspeth, New York. The cases of Salmonella poisoning are linked to the consumption of broiled chicken livers, which appear to be ready-to-eat, but are in fact partially cooked and need to be fully cooked before consumption. Illnesses are also linked to chopped liver made from this product at retail stores.

The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg was isolated by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Market from samples of broiled chicken livers from the establishment, and chopped chicken livers produced at retail from these livers. This is solid microbiological evidence (the&quot;smoking gun&quot;) that can be used in a lawsuit against Schreiber Processing Corporation, a retailer and others .

Chicken Liver Recall

Prompted by this outbreak, Schreiber Processing Corporation recalled an undetermined amount of broiled chicken liver products. The products subject to recall include:

 10 lb. boxes with two, 5 lb. bags of&quot;Meal Mart Broiled Chicken Liver; Made for Further Thermal Processing&quot; 10 lb. boxes of loose packed&quot;Chicken Liver Broiled&quot; 

Each bag or box bears the establishment number&quot;P-787&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was distributed to retail stores and institutional users in Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The following stores may have received some recalled chicken livers:

 Pine Nut Recall Expands To 21,000 Pounds 
 Posted on November 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A recall of tainted pine nuts that are the source of a Salmonella outbreak that has sickened 42 people has been expanded from 5,000 pounds to 21,000 pounds, the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Friday.

On October 26, Wegmans Food Markets, Inc., of Rochester, N.Y., announced a recall of approximately 5,000 lbs. of Turkish pine nuts sold at its stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland between July 1 and October 18, 2011, due to possible Salmonella contamination.

On Friday, November 4, Wegmans pine nut supplier, Sunrise Commodities, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, announced that it is recalling 21,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts after FDA tests confirmed the presence of Salmonella on the product. Additional testing is underway to determine if the Salmonella detected matches the outbreak strain.

Sunrise Commodities has voluntarily recalled four lots of Turkish pine nuts that were distributed in bulk to various food vendors in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Canada. Each lot was packed in 22-pound boxes and included the markings:

   Warehouse Lot 27963 with the identifying code“PO#: 50165”
   Warehouse Lot 29628 with the identifying code“PO#: 50558”
   Warehouse Lot 27713 with the identifying code“PO#: 49595”
   Warehouse Lot 27427 with the identifying code“PO#: 50032 ”

 

 Sy mptoms of salmonellosis i nclude diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. However, in some cases, the symptoms may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. If it spreads to the intestines or bloodstream a Salmonella infection can be serious and sometimes, fatal. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are most susceptible to likely Salmonella infection. Anyone who has these symptoms should seek medical attention. 

The law firm of PritzkerOlsen P.A.  is representing a person from New York who was hospitalized after she consumed pine nuts sold at Wegmans.

 New York Hit Hardest By Pine Nut Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on November 4, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Our law firm is representing a person from New York who was hospitalized after she consumed pine nuts sold at Wegmans. Attorney Ryan Osterholm is our managing attorney for these cases. He can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or by submitting our free consultation form .

Almost two thirds of the people sickened by the pine nut Salmonella outbreak are from New York . Of the 42 people who contracted salmonellosis from Turkish pine nuts sold in bulk bins at Wegmans grocery stores, 27 are from New York, according the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 The outbreak includes victims from four other states. Eight people have been sickened in Pennsylvania , four in Virginia, two in New Jersey and one in Maryland. The victims range in age from less than 1 to 94 years old, putting the median age at 43. Sixty percent of victims are female. So far, two people have required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. Due to the lag in reporting time, illnesses that occurred after October 6, 2011, might not be reported yet, so the total number of case may increase, the CDC cautions. 

 Public health investigators are using DNA“fingerprints”of the Salmonella bacteria to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak which began on or after August 20, 2011.  Virginia health investigators isolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella  Enteritidis from Turkish pine nuts that were purchased from bulk bins at Wegmans stores and collected from an ill person’s home. 

 New York health investigators isolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis from two separate samples of homemade pesto containing Turkish pine nuts from two unrelated ill persons&apos; homes, and from Turkish pine nuts from bulk bins at a Wegmans store and collected from another ill person’s home.  

 Wegmans Food Markets, Inc., Rochester, N.Y., has recalled approximately 5,000 lbs of Turkish pine nuts sold in the bulk foods departments of most of its stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland between July 1 and October 18, 2011. 

 Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. However, in some cases, the symptoms may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. If it spreads to the intestines or bloodstream a Salmonella infection can be serious and sometimes, fatal. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are most susceptible to likely Salmonella infection. Anyone who has these symptoms should seek medical attention.

 Contact our attorneys for a free consultation regarding a Wegmans lawsuit for Salmonella poisoning from pine nuts .

Investigation of the Salmonella Outbreak

Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked this outbreak to eating Turkish pine nuts sold in bulk bins at Wegmans grocery stores. Some Turkish pine nuts were consumed as an ingredient in prepared foods, such as Caprese salad or asparagus with pine nuts, sold at Wegmans stores.

Among 30 ill persons for whom information is available, 19 (63%) reported consuming Turkish pine nuts or products containing these pine nuts in the week before their illness began.

Early in the investigation, shopper card information was collected and used to identify which specific products to suspect as sources of illness. Ill persons gave permission for public health officials to retrieve shopper card purchase information. A review of shopper card records identified that ill persons had purchased the same type of Turkish pine nuts from bulk bins at different locations of Wegmans grocery stores before becoming ill.

Laboratory testing conducted by the Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services isolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis from Turkish pine nuts that were purchased from bulk bins at Wegmans stores and collected from an ill person’s home. The Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services also isolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis from retail samples of Turkish pine nuts collected from a Wegmans store where ill persons reported shopping. Laboratory testing conducted by the New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center Laboratory, isolated Salmonella Enteritidis from two separate samples of homemade pesto containing Turkish pine nuts from two unrelated ill persons&apos; homes, and from Turkish pine nuts which were purchased from bulk bins at a Wegmans store and collected from another ill person’s home. Both samples of homemade pesto have been tested and it is determined the Salmonella in these pine nuts is also the outbreak strain. Further tests on the whole bulk pine nuts are pending.

Wegmans Pine Nuts Recall

Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is recalling approximately 5,000 lbs. of Turkish Pine Nuts sold in the Bulk Foods department of most Wegmans stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland between July 1 and October 18, 2011 due to possible Salmonella contamination.

The recalled Turkish pine nuts were imported from Turkey by Sunrise Commodities of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. The recalled pine nuts were not sold at the company’s Northborough, Massachusetts store, which opened on Sunday, October 16.

Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is a 79-store supermarket chain with stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, and Massachusetts.

 Minnesota Organic Egg Salmonella Cases 
 Posted on October 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Minnesota is investigating a seventh case of Salmonella Enteritidis that may be linked to organic eggs from free range chickens at Larry Schultz Organic Farm in Owatonna, Minnesota.

The Minnesota departments of health and agriculture jointly announced late last week that three people were hospitalized and three others were sick enough to see a doctor and test positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella.   An investigation linked the illnesses to the same producer and a recall ensued for Larry Schultz Organic Farm, Lunds&amp;Byerly’s, and Kowalski’s organic eggs . The recalled eggs (click for details) were distributed to restaurants, grocery stores, food wholesalers and foodservice companies in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Phyllis Entis, aka the Food Bug Lady, reports that now a seventh case is under investigation. She quotes Trisha Robinson, Senior Epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health. The FDA told Phyllis that  Larry Schultz Organic Farm is a small producer, with fewer than 3,000 laying hens, and therefore is is not subject to the FDA’s Egg Safety Rule and, therefore, was not on the FDA’s inspection schedule.
 
 Just because a farm is labeled&quot;organic&apos;&apos; or the laying hens are&quot;free range,&apos;&apos; doesn&apos;t mean they are living in an environment free of  Salmonella or other human pathogens.  
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that for every confirmed case of Salmonella during an outbreak, many other people are usually sickened by the same bug but haven&apos;t seen a doctor who ordered a stool sample that would allow them to be detected as an outbreak victim. If you or a loved one believe you have developed a  Salmonella infection after eating organic eggs from the Larry Schultz farm, see your health care provider immediately.  

For answers to legal questions about submitting a claim for compensation, contact an attorney at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a Minnesota-based law firm that is recognized around the country as a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation. Free case consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by leaving your contact information .

 Salmonella Outbreaks and Eggs 
 Posted on October 21, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Minnesota Salmonella outbreak marks the second time in five years that shell eggs have been the source of a Salmonella outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Nearly 2,000 cases of salmonellosis were confirmed during the previous outbreak, which occurred during the summer of 2010. That outbreak was linked to unsanitary conditions on two Iowa farms: Wright County Egg , in Galt, Iowa, and Hillandale Farms of Iowa, Inc..

Salmonellosis, the infection caused by the bacteria Salmonella, causes an estimated 1.4 million cases of foodborne illness and more than 400 deaths annually in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Salmonella can be present on all raw foods including, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nut and legumes. To reduce risk of illness from eggs, the CDC recommends the following measures:

 Keep eggs refrigerated at or below 40°F (≤4°C) at all times. Discard cracked or dirty eggs. Wash hands and all food contact surface areas (counter tops, utensils, and cutting boards) with soap and water after contact with raw eggs. Then, disinfect the food contact surfaces using a sanitizing agent, such as bleach, following label instructions. Cook eggs until both the white and the yolk are firm, eat them promptly after cooking. Do not keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods promptly. Don’t eat raw or undercooked eggs.

 Minnesota Grocery Stores Pull Recalled Eggs From Shelves 
 Posted on October 21, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Lunds, Byerly’s, Whole Foods and The Wedge Coop stores have pulled eggs produced by Larry Schultz Organic Farm of Owatonna from their shelves at all locations following the announcement of a recall due to possible Salmonella contamination.

 At least six people In Minnesota have been diagnosed with salmonellosis, an infection caused by eating food contaminated with Salmonella . Five of them reported eating eggs produced at the Owatonna farm prior to becoming ill. 

Roughly 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But, because many of the milder cases are not reported, the CDC estimates that the actual number of Americans who get sick from Salmonella is probably closer to 1.2 million every year.

Healthy people infected with Salmonella may experience diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. But for those most at risk, including very young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, Salmonella poisoning can be a serious health risk.

Minnesotans who believe they contracted salmonellosis after eating eggs associated with this recall should contact their health care provider. Those with legal questions about an illness associated with this outbreak or recall should contact the nation’s leading foodborne illness lawyers at PritzkerOlsen , P.A. for a free consultation.

 Oregon Dismisses Del Monte Complaint 
 Posted on September 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Oregon Government Ethics Commission has dismissed a complaint filed in August by Del Monte Fresh Produce against the state’s senior epidemiologist William Keene.

The seven-member citizen commission charged with enforcing government ethics laws said the issues outlined in Del Monte’s complaint fall outside its mandate to ensure that public office is not used for personal gain, according to a story in The Oregonian.

Del Monte did not allege in the complaint that Keene used his office for personal gain, but rather that he conducted a“cursory investigation”and committed a“clear error of judgment,”in concluding that tainted cantaloupe was source of a Salmonella outbreak , according to the story.

Keene and was one of several state and federal scientists who concluded that the tainted cantaloupe came from Del Monte’s facility in Asuncion Mita, Guatemala. The company maintains its cantaloupes were not the source of the outbreak and that none ever tested positive for Salmonella Panama, the strain involved in the outbreak.

In addition to the ethics complaint, Del Monte filed a tort claim in August announcing its intentions to sue the Oregon Health Authority over the outbreak.

 Cargill Ground Turkey Salmonella Outbreak Spreads, 119 Sick in 32 States 
 Posted on September 16, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Cargill ground turkey Salmonella outbreak has continued to spread, entering New Jersey for the first time and adding victims in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The toll now stands at 119 sickened in 32 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 A ground turkey recall was issued September 11, by Cargill Inc., after Salmonella Heidelberg was discovered again at its Springdale, Arkansas plant. Discovery of the same strain in August prompted the plant’s two-week closure and the recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey, one of the largest recalls in U.S. history.

Contaminated ground turkey is again being recalled from grocery stores but health officials are concerned that some tainted meat may still be in consumers&apos; home freezers.The latest recall of 185,000 pounds of ground turkey products including ground meat trays, patties and chubs. The products were distributed nationwide under the Honeysuckle White, Kroger and Fresh HEB brands.

The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg is resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics; this antibiotic resistance may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals, according to the CDC.

 More Cargill Ground Turkey Recalled Salmonella Found at Same Arkansas Plant 
 Posted on September 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Cargill Inc. is recalling more ground turkey because Salmonella has been discovered again at its Springdale, Arkansas plant, the source of a Salmonella outbreak last month that killed one person and sickened 110 others in 31 states.

 The discovery of Salmonella at the plant in August prompted its two-week closure and the  recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey, one of the largest recalls in U.S. history.

Less than a month after reopening, the Springdale plant yielded another positive sample of the same Salmonella Heidelberg strain associated with the August outbreak, according to a statement released by the company.

No illnesses have been associated with the latest recall of 185,000 pounds of ground turkey products including ground meat trays, patties and chubs. The products were distributed nationwide under the Honeysuckle White, Kroger and Fresh HEB brands.

 Cargill Food Poisoning Outbreak Part of a Dangerous Trend 
 Posted on September 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Cargill turkey Salmonella outbreak that sickened 111 people in 31 states over a five- month period is one of an increasing number of Salmonella outbreaks that happen every year in the United States.
Although total foodborne infections have decreased by nearly one-fourth over the last 15 years, Salmonella cases have increased by 10 percent in recent years, according to statistics gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Every year, Salmonella sickens more than 1 million Americans, accounting for about half of the hospitalizations and deaths among the nine foodborne illnesses the CDC tracks through FoodNet,&quot;said CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden, M.D., in a recent press release. Salmonella poisoning generates $365 million in direct medical costs every year.
 
“Continued investments are essential to detect, investigate, and stop outbreaks promptly in order to protect our food supply,&quot;Frieden stated.
 
The Cargill Salmonella outbreak was linked to the company’s Springdale, Arkansas processing plant. In one of the largest recalls in history, the company recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey , which had been distributed nationwide. Potentially contaminated products include Ground Turkey Chubs or 85% Ground Turkey with Use or Freeze by Dates of 2/20/11 through 8/23/11 under the brand names Honeysuckle White, Shady Brook Farms, Riverside, Aldi&apos;s Fit and Active, Giant Eagle, HEB, Kroger and Safeway. Of particular concern are products that consumers may have stored in home freezers, health officials said.

If you have legal questions about an illness related to this outbreak. Contact one of the attorneys who specializes in Salmonella at Pritzker Olsen, P.A., the nationally recognized foodborne illness experts.

 Salmonella in Pork Barbecue With Vinegar and Pepper-based Sauce 
 Posted on September 8, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Pork barbecue with vinegar and pepper-based sauce accounted for 23 percent of all samples of ready-to-eat meats that tested positive for Salmonella between 2005 and 2010, according to a recent study by USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.

No known illnesses have been associated with these products, but the high rate of incidence has the agency concerned. In a notice issued September 6, it ordered inspectors to meet with mangers of all plants that produce such products to make them aware of the study’s findings. Inspectors have also been instructed to review the safety of ingredients that are added to these products after the meat has been cooked.

Although the source of Salmonella in these products is not clear, one possibility is contaminated ingredients, such as the pepper or other spices in the sauce, that are added to the cooked and processes meat, the agency stated in a notice it released about the study.

“During processing of these products, the pork was cooked first, and the barbecue sauce was added after the cooking step. The lack of a lethality treatment for the sauce or its ingredients (e.g. pepper or other spices) could result in contamination of the final product,”the notice stated.

Until the notice expires Oct 1. 2012, members of the agency’s Risk, Innovations, and Management Division will work with the Data Analysis and Integration Group to review actions taken by establishments that test positive for Salmonella, to ensure that hazards have been addressed.

 Salmonella Papaya Litigation Will Extend Beyond Life of 8-Month Outbreak 
 Posted on August 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The papaya Salmonella outbreak in Texas and 24 other states appears to be over -- linked to whole papayas imported from Mexico by Agromod Produce Inc. of McAllen, Texas. While new cases have nearly dried up, some families and individuals may still be looking for legal representation in litigation against the purveyors.

A public claims center for Salmonella papaya litigation remains open to all victims at national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Free case consultations also are available by submitting contact information to the firm. Pritzker Olsen Attorneys is one of the very few legal groups in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for Salmonella victims throughout the United States.

 The papaya Salmonella recall includes all Blondie, Yaya, Mañanita, and Tastylicious Brand papayas sold prior to July 23, 2011 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , a total of 106 individuals were infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona beginning January 1, 2011. It tooks months of traceback work and laboratory testing to determine the connection to Mexican-grown papayas and Agromod Produce, but the CDC and other health agencies -- in conjunction with Mexican counterparts -- continue to search for the cause of the contamination.
 
 Going forward, the FDA has issued an Import Alert under which papayas from each source in Mexico may be denied admission into the United States unless the importer shows they are not contaminated with Salmonella. 
 
The number of ill persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain was as follows: Arkansas (1), Arizona (4), California (8), Colorado (1), Georgia (8), Illinois (18), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (1), Minnesota (3), Missouri (3), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (3), New York (9), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (2), Tennessee (1), Texas (25), Virginia (2), Washington (5), and Wisconsin (2).

Ten patients were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

 One Year After Salmonella Egg Outbreak, Unsanitary Conditions Persist 
 Posted on August 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 One year after a Salmonella outbreak that sickened 1,900 people and prompted the recall of a half-billion eggs, government inspectors are sill finding that many Iowa egg farms are unsanitary and lack adequate measures to prevent Salmonella from causing illness in egg consumers, according to an investigative report by the Des Moines Register. 1 

In fact, many of the state’s major producers aren’t even meeting minimum federal standards designed to protect consumers from illness, the newspaper discovered after filing a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

Furthermore, the egg salmonella outbreak and egg recall apparently have had no affect on reporting regulations or spurred more rigorous enforcement that would include fines and penalties. According to the report, Iowa egg producers are still not required to tell state officials if they find Salmonella on their farms and none of the violations has resulted in fines or penalties from state or federal agencies. 
 
“The federal Food and Drug Administration says it has never fined or closed down any egg-production facilities in the United States,”the story states.
 
Key information was blacked out on some of the documents the paper reviewed including: the size of rodent infestations, the brand names under which the eggs are being sold, and the names of diseases documented on farms. 

Among the problems outlined in the story:

 Inspections are announced days in advance, sometimes on dates chosen by the producers. Inspections are still based, in part, on the honor system. Insepctors do little on-site testing for Salmonella and instead rely on self-reported, in-house test results, even though laboratories performing those tests are not required to be licensed or accredited. Penalties for health and safety violations that could lead to Salmonella poisoning are nonexistent at both the state and federal levels. 
 
For the past 10 years, Iowa has been the nation’s biggest egg producer, with 57 million hens producing 14 billion eggs each year, twice the output Ohio, the country’s second-largest producer, the report states. But the state does not lead the country in oversight of egg production. On a state-level, it does almost none, leaving that job to the federal government which is grappling with implementation of the new food-safety guidlelines that took effect last July.

 Salmonella from Chicks and Ducklings Linked to Mount Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio 
 Posted on August 26, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Health officials have linked two outbreaks of Salmonella infections ( salmonellosis ) to chicks and ducklings from a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio. Nearly 100 people in 20 states have become ill.

The outbreaks involved two strains of Salmonella , Altona and Johannesburg . In both outbreaks, officials found multiple tracebacks from the homes of those who were sickened to Mount Healthy Hatcheries of Mount Healthy, Ohio.

 

 Salmonella Altona

65 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Altona have been reported from 20 states: Alabama (1), Georgia (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (5), Maryland (5), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Mississippi (1), New Hampshire (1), New York (4), North Carolina (8), Ohio (12), Pennsylvania (6), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (3), Texas (1), Virginia (7), Vermont (1), Wisconsin (1), and West Virginia (4).

 Salmonella Johannesburg

27 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Johannesburg have been reported from 15 states: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Georgia (2), Indiana (1), Kansas (1), Kentucky (2), Maine (1), New York (4), North Carolina (4), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (2), Vermont (2), and West Virginia (1).

Salmonellosis Prevention

Raising chickens in residential settings has become increasingly popular, but it doesn&apos;t eliminate the risk of foodborne illness. Over the last several years, the CDC has identified several outbreaks of Salmonella tied to backyard chickens.

To prevent illness, the CDC recommends that chickens be kept away from people with weaker immune systems, the elderly and children under five, that family members never snuggle or kiss the birds, that they never touch their mouths, eat or drink around live poultry and that they always wash their hands with soap and water after handling.

 Turkey Salmonella Lawyer Says Cargill Reforms Too Late For 2011 Victims 
 Posted on August 26, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Facing one turkey Salmonella lawsuit after another, Cargill announced this week that it has assembled a panel of food safety experts to review upgrades at its large turkey processing plant in Springdale, Arkansas. Salmonella -laden ground turkey from the plant has been linked to a death in California and to at least 110 illnesses in 31 states across the U.S.

Cargill is still recalling ground turkey products -- 36 million pounds in all -- to help bring the outbreak to an end. Meanwhile, state and federal health officials are still sounding consumer alerts to keep people from eating recalled ground turkey that could be stored in their home freezers. Click here for complete Cargill turkey recall information

 A claim center for members of the public who have been sickened in this outbreak has been established by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) and the firm continues to accept new cases. Another way to receive a free Cargill lawsuit case consultation , is to send your contact information to the firm, online. Pritzker Olsen Attorneys is one of the very few legal groups in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and our work has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in recoveries for victims of food poisoning.

Cargill is a multinational food and commodities corporation based in Minnesota, not far from the Minneapolis home offices of our firm. Cargill said in a press release this week that a panel of independent experts will assess new food safety measures that were put in place since the recall was announced Aug. 3.&quot;We have asked the panel to look at the entire process from live animal operations through ground turkey production,&apos;&apos; the company said.
 
 Fred Pritzker, founder and president of Pritzker Olsen, has called on Cargill to immediately pay the medical bills and other expenses incurred by families and individuals sickened in this outbreak, including the many who were hospitalized. For those victims, any improvements to procedures and plant cleanliness at Cargill&apos;s facility in Arkansas will come too late. Payments for those direct losses could be made while more comprehensive turkey Salmonella litigation continues, Prtizker has said

 Papaya Salmonella Contamination Prompts FDA Import Alert 
 Posted on August 25, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Papayas from Mexico have been linked to approximately 100 cases of Salmonella Agona in 23 U.S. states:

Arkansas (1), Arizona (3), California (7), Colorado (1), Georgia (8), Illinois (17), Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (1), Minnesota (3), Missouri (3), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (3), New York (7), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (2), Tennessee (1), Texas (25), Virginia (2), Washington (5), and Wisconsin (2).

 FDA has been collecting and analyzing samples of raw, fresh whole papaya imported from Mexico. From May 12, 2011, to August 18, 2011, FDA analysis found Salmonella in 33 samples out of a total of 211, or a 15.6% positive rate. The positive samples were from 28 different firms and include nearly all the major papaya producing regions in Mexico.

Given this evidence, FDA has determined that papaya imported from Mexico appears to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the papayas appear to contain Salmonella , an added poisonous or deleterious substance that may render food injurious to health.

Now, under an FDA Import Alert issued today , papayas from each source in Mexico may be denied admission into the United States unless the importer shows they are not contaminated with Salmonella , such as by using private laboratories to test the papayas.

 Cargill Salmonella Outbreak Hits Utah 
 Posted on August 24, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Cargill turkey salmonella outbreak has reached Utah, health officials said. A Salt Lake County resident is the first reported case of Salmonella related to the outbreak that began nearly five months ago.

The Salt Lake County resident was sickened by a secondary strain associated with the outbreak but did not require hospitalization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to release the number of illnesses from that secondary strain. But they have confirmed that the original Salmonella Heidelberg strain has killed one woman in California and sickened at least 110 others in 31 states.

The outbreak has been linked to Cargill’s Springdale Arkansas turkey grinding plant and the company has recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey. Turkey products were distributed in Utah, although they have since been pulled from store shelves. Potentially contaminated products include the Honeysuckle White, Shady Brook Farms, Riverside, Aldi&apos;s Fit and Active, Giant Eagle, HEB, Kroger and Safeway brands. Of particular concern are products that may be stored in home freezers, officials said.

If you or a loved became ill after consuming a turkey product that is part of this Cargill turkey recall, seek medical attention. If you have questions about a Cargill turkey lawsuit contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, P.A. at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting your contact information online.

 Lantibiotics Could Combat Deadly Bugs 
 Posted on August 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
University of Minnesota researchers have discovered and patented a naturally occurring lantibiotic that could be added to food to kill harmful bacteria like Salmonella , E. coli a nd Listeria . 

Lantibiotics are peptides produced by harmless bacteria. The U of M lantibiotic is the first natural preservative found to kill the harmful kind of bacteria that can cause a range of foodborne illnesses and complications like hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thromboctyopenic purpura (TPP) conditions that routinely result in kidney failure but can also cause stroke, seizure, paralysis, heart problems and serious anemia. Children under five are most at risk.

As a food additive, the lantibiotic could be used to prevent harmful bacteria in meats, processed cheeses, egg and dairy products, canned foods, seafood, salad dressing, fermented beverages and many other foods, researchers said. In addition to food safety benefits, lantibiotics are easy to digest, nontoxic, do not induce allergies and are difficult for dangerous bacteria to develop resistance against.

Every year, one of every six Americans -about 48 million people- becomes sick from a foodborne illness. Of those, 28,000 are hospitalized and about 3000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In recent years, Salmonella outbreaks have increased more dramatically than any other foodborne illness, according to Shaun Kennedy, director of the National Center for Food Protection and Defense. Salmonella contributes to an estimated 28 percent of the 3,000 deaths related to foodborne illness each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Salmonella contamination spawned one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history earlier this month when Cargill recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey . The potentially contaminated meat from Cargill&apos;s turkey plant in Springdale, Arkansas, has been linked by the USDA to an outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg that killed a woman in California and sickened at least 110 others in 31 states. This strain has been discovered to be resistant to multiple drugs, which may increase the risk of hospitalization or complicate treatment of infected individuals.

Most people infected with Salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. In some cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness from Salmonella infection, including Reiter&apos;s syndrome .

While state, local and federal authorities investigate the Cargill Salmonella outbreak , the The U of M’s Office for Technology Commercialization is searching for a licensee for the lantibiotic technology that could prevent such outbreaks in the future.

 Cargill Turkey Lawsuit Action Will Stem From Sales Made to 1,373 U.S. Stores 
 Posted on August 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Cargill ground turkey Salmonella recall -- at 36 million pounds -- has been called one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history. The contaminated meat from Cargill&apos;s turkey plant in Springdale, Arkansas, has been linked by the USDA to an outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg that killed a woman in California and sickened at least 110 others in 31 states.

Since the recall was announced August 3, the USDA&apos;s Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) has compiled a very long list of retail outlets across the country where the ground turkey products were sold. National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has been accepting cases from this outbreak for a Cargill turkey lawsuit. Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania are the states hardest hit. 

As part of its Cargill turkey Salmonella  litigation work, Pritzker Olsen Attorneys has analyzed the retail data and is recommending that consumers consult the complete recall and retail lists to ensure they don&apos;t have recalled ground turkey made by Cargill in their home freezers. If you or a family member has experienced Salmonella type symptoms after eating ground turkey, contact your physician immediately. For turkey Salmonella lawsuit questions, call Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or submit contact information online.

 Cargill turkey recalled from 1,373 stores

 Cargill Frozen Turkey Salmonella Alert 
 Posted on August 19, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella -tainted ground turkey from Cargill has been recalled from grocery stores but may still be in home freezers of unsuspecting consumers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. The CDC&apos;s warning and update on the Cargill turkey Salmonella outbreak came 15 days after Cargill&apos;s plant in Springdale, Arkansas, recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey products -- one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history.

 A total of 111 persons infected with the turkey-borne outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg have been reported. The outbreak strain is resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics; this antibiotic resistance may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals. Honeysuckle White ground turkey is the biggest brand name in this outbreak, but there are others to look out for in your freezer. Click here for the complete Cargill Turkey Recall listing.

Eventual Cargill turkey lawsuits will cover victims in Texas, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, California, Pennsylvania and 24 other states. A public claims center for turkey litigation is available at national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting your contact information online. Case consultations are free with Salmonella lawyers who have many years of food poisoning litigation experience, including direct experience against Cargill, a multinational corporation with its headquarters within a few miles of the Pritzker Olsen home office in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
 
 America&apos;s food industry is increasingly consolidated into the hands of large corporations and holding those companies accountable for producing safe, wholesome food -- free of microscopic bugs that send people to the hospital -- is a vital part of our food safety defense. Plant conditions can be shockingly negligent even in large, modern facilities owned by rich corporations, as experience has shown. 
 
Cargill Springdale, Arkansas, Investigation Results Dated Aug. 18, 2011: 

The latest Cargill Salmonella outbreak update by CDC says that the first illnesses began in late February and have infected people ranging in age from less than 1 year to 89 years old. The median age of victims is 21. More than half are male and 37 percent have been hospitalized. In California, a Salmonella death in an elderly woman has created the worst tragedy of this outbreak.

Cultures of five ground turkey samples purchased from five retail locations between March 7 and June 27, 2011, yielded Salmonella Heidelberg with the outbreak strain. Genetic fingerprint patterns from these Salmonella bacteria were added to the CDC national PulseNet database between April 11 and July 12, approximately a month after each sample was collected. Preliminary information indicates that all of these products originated from the same large food-production establishment: Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas.

 Massive Investigation of Salmonella Outbreak Includes State, Federal and Local Authorities 
 Posted on August 18, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 State, local and federal health officials are collaborating on an investigation of the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak linked to ground turkey that has sickened 111 people in 31 states.
The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg is resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics, which may increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

Investigators are using DNA“fingerprints” of Salmonella bacteria to identify ill people who may be part of this outbreak. Between February 27 and August 9, 2011, 111 cases of Salmonella Heidelberg from the outbreak strain have been reported and one person has died.

Most people infected with Salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. In some cases, diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In this outbreak, a large percentage of people have been hospitalized, 37% (27 people). This may be because the Salmonella Heidelberg strain involved in this outbreak is resistant to antibiotics. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

In response to this outbreak, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas, has recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey products thought to be contaminated with Salmonella Heidelberg. Investigators are concerned that some consumers may have the tainted product in their home freezers. The products subject to ground turkey recall all bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection.

 After Safety Enhancements, Cargill Resumes Ground Turkey Production 
 Posted on August 18, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
After a Salmonella outbreak linked to Cargill ground turkey sickened over 100 people in 31 states, the company added new safety measures to its plant in Springdale, Arkansas and received approval from the USDA to resume operations on August 17.

The plant has been closed since August 3, when Cargill announced the recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey that had been distributed nationwide. Before reopening, all of the equipment at the plant was disassembled and steam cleaned, a new monitoring and testing program was installed and two antibacterial measures were added to those already in place. The company is also requiring its Springdale suppliers to use comparable antibacterial technology.

 Salmonella  lawyers at Pritzker Olsen have been investigating conditions at the plant, the likely source of one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history. The  Salmonella Heidelberg strain associated with the massive turkey recall has proven resistant to common antibiotics, complicating medical treatment for many of those who have been sickened. If you need legal advice about an illness or hospitalization, contact the foodborne illness experts at Pritzker Olsen at 1 (888) 377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting our free consultation form .

 Cargill Turkey Lawsuit Swirling During Reopening of Plant in Arkansas 
 Posted on August 17, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Cargill turkey lawsuits are swirling as the company reopens its turkey grinding operation at the plant in Springdale, Arkansas. When federal health officials linked the factory to a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg, Cargill shut it down on August 3 and recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 107 people in 31 states have been sickened in the outbreak, which began in February. One person, a woman from California, has died. The states hardest hit by the outbreak include Texas, California, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania 

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has established a public claims center for at least one Cargill turkey lawsuit and has been in contact with victims. The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg has proven resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics, complicating the medical community&apos;s response. The added expense and prolonged pain and suffering will go into calculations for damages that must be paid by Cargill to victims of this outbreak . Salmonella lawyers  at Pritzker Olsen are accepting cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or will respond to your  contact information submitted via the web.

News reporter Mike Hughlett of the Star Tribune reported today that Minnesota-based Cargill restarted limited production of a ground turkey product that had been subject to recall. Production resumed after the addition of new safety measures approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a Cargill spokesman told the newspaper. They included intensifying anti-bacterial washing of birds during processing.

Pritzker Olsen attorneys have been investigating conditions at the plant and whether Cargill was adhering to proper food safety controls.

 Cargill Turkey Salmonella Hits Montana 
 Posted on August 15, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Montana residents are being warned to be vigilant and check their freezers for turkey products linked to the Cargill Salmonella outbreak that has killed one person and sickened more than 105 others in 31 states.

The Montana Department of Health and Human Services announced the state&apos;s first confirmed illness in the national turkey Salmonella outbreak discovered in July. Federal health officials say ground turkey products from Cargill&apos;s plant in Arkansas are causing the outbreak. Cargill, the multinational food and commodities corporation, last month recalled 36 million pounds of the product, mainly packaged under the Honeysuckle White brand. While much of the meat has been consumed or returned, unknown quantities of it are still lurking in home freezers.

 A public information center for a Cargill turkey lawsuit has been established at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the nation&apos;s leading foodborne illness law firms. Free case consultations for victims and their families are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by sending your contact information . Our attorneys have gone up against Cargill in past outbreaks, winning settlements for food poisoning victims who would be disadvantaged in negotiations if not represented by legal counsel.

Some people with Salmonellosis develop serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and even death. The person who died in the current Cargill Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak was a woman from California. The outbreak strain of Salmonella has been proven to be resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics -- causing prolonged and more expensive illnesses in some cases.
 
 &quot;Since the recall, (Montana Public Health) has worked with local health departments to ensure these products are no longer being sold in Montana,&quot;Director Anna Whiting Sorrell said.&quot;However, Montanans should be vigilant and check their freezers for this product.&apos;&apos; 
 
Complete details of the Cargill turkey recall are available on the Pritzker Olsen Attorneys website. All products subject to recall bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection.

 Salmonella Heidelberg in Cargill Ground Turkey Linked to Illnesses in Texas, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Other States 
 Posted on August 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Most people don&apos;t pause before taking a bite of a turkey burger to consider whether it will send them to the hospital. No one should have to consider eating ground turkey a game of Russian roulette. But an outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg infections has been linked to ground turkey products produced by a Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation plant in Springdale, Arkansas.

A total of 107 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg have been reported from 31 states between February 27 and August 9, 2011. We are still getting contacts from people who think they may be part of the outbreak, so the outbreak numbers may grow.

The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Arizona (3), California (6), Colorado (2), Georgia (2), Illinois (13), Indiana (1), Iowa (2), Kansas (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (3), Maryland (1), Michigan (12), Minnesota (2), Mississippi (1), Missouri (4), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New York (2), North Carolina (3), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (2), Texas (14), Utah (1), and Wisconsin (4).

Among persons for whom information is available, illnesses began on or after February 27, 2011. According to news reports, Cargill may have known about Salmonella Heidelberg contamination of ground turkey from the Arkansas plant months before this date.

Of the 107 identified cases, 25 (39%) have been hospitalized. One death, a woman from Sacramento County, California, has been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak

Outbreak investigations involve gathering epidemiological and microbiological evidence to determine the source of the outbreak.

The epidemiological evidence is as follows:

Among the 71 ill persons with available information, 40 (56%) reported consuming ground turkey. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy persons in which 11% of persons interviewed reported consuming ground turkey in the 7 days before they were interviewed.

The microbiological evidence is as follows:

Cultures of five ground turkey samples purchased from five retail locations between March 7 and June 27, 2011, yielded Salmonella Heidelberg with the outbreak strain. PFGE patterns from these Salmonella bacteria were added to the PulseNet database between April 11 and July 12, approximately a month after each sample was collected. Preliminary information indicates that all of these products originated from a common food-production establishment (Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas). These products were obtained as part of routine sampling in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)External Web Site Icon, and are not linked to illnesses.

This is a multi-drug resistant strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. As of August 5, 2011, investigators have collected antibiotic resistance information on isolates from four samples of ground turkey collected at retail and from nine ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. The isolatesfrom the ground turkey samples are resistant to antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin. The sensitivity testing results, to date, indicate that isolates from humans are also resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, and some are resistant to gentamicin; however, the testing is not complete for all isolates. All human isolates are sensitive to several common antibiotics that are used in clinical practice such as ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antimicrobial resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

A sample of leftover unlabeled frozen ground turkey was collected by public health officials from the home of an ill person in Ohio infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. Culture of the ground turkey sample yielded the outbreak strain on July 29, 2011. In addition to the outbreak strain with the“initial”PGFE pattern, a second closely related PFGE pattern of Salmonella Heidelberg was identified in the contaminated leftover product. Since February 27, 2011, a total of 23 ill persons have been reported to PulseNet with this closely related PGFE pattern. Among the 8 such patients that have been interviewed to date, 6 (75%) report consumption of ground turkey in the week before their illness began. The closely related PGFE pattern was also found in a retail sample of ground turkey taken as part of NARMS surveillance. This retail sample originated from Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation establishment in Springdale, Arkansas. Based on these findings, the 23 ill persons with this second closely related PFGE pattern of Salmonella Heidelberg have been included in the total count of outbreak cases.

Cargill Ground Turkey Recall

In response to this outbreak, on August 3, 2011, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation, a Springdale, Arkansas, establishment, recalled approximately 36 million pounds of ground turkey products that may be contaminated with a multi-drug resistant strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. The products subject to recall bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. Read more about the Cargill ground turkey recall and a Cargill lawsuit .

 Cargill Recall of Turkey Too Late to Save One Life and Prevent over 70 Salmonella Illnesses 
 Posted on August 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 On March 9, 2011, the first Salmonella Heidelberg illness was reported in an outbreak that has sickened at least 78 people and killed one. The same strain of Salmonella Heidelberg was found in a ground turkey sample purchased from a retail location in March. The contaminated ground turkey had been processed at a Cargill turkey processing plant in Arkansas. By April 11, at the latest, federal and state health officials had the evidence needed to connect Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses with Cargill ground turkey because PFGE patterns matching the outbreak strain were added to the PulseNet database beginning on April 11.

Why did it take until August 3 for Cargill to recall the ground turkey? Why did the USDA-FSIS warn consumers about ground turkey on July 29, but not mention Cargill? They knew at that time exactly where the contaminated ground turkey was coming from, yet this is what USDA-FSIS said on July 29:
 
CDC is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS focuses its investigation on potential identification of a contamination source(s).
 
People were scared of eating all ground turkey products, and all companies that processed, distributed and sold ground turkey products suffered. All USDA-FSIS had to do to prevent hysteria was let consumers know that it was Cargill ground turkey processed at the Arkansas plant that had sickened the victims of the outbreak.

Bill Tomson of The Wall Street Journal reported that the USDA-FSIS knew about the Salmonella Heidelberg contamination at the Arkansas turkey processing plant last year:

A routine USDA inspection last year of the Cargill plant in Arkansas turned up three samples contaminated with salmonella Heidelberg, the agency said. A USDA spokesman said the agency brought the findings&quot;to the attention of the facility.&quot;

Elisabeth Hagen, the USDA&apos;s top food-safety official, told The Wall Street Journal that nothing could be done about the contamination at the time because Salmonella is not an adulterant under federal law unless the meat is linked to Salmonella illnesses.

It should not have taken almost 80 cases of Salmonella Heidelberg infection for Cargill to recall the ground turkey. Let’s hope in the future Cargill recalls products as soon as the company knows there is a potential for illness and death.

People from the following states have been sickened in the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak linked to Cargill ground turkey products:

 Alabama Arizona California (one Californian died) Georgia Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Nebraska Nevada New York North Carolina Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Wisconsin

 Ohio Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Cargill Turkey Investigated by Attorneys 
 Posted on August 8, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Our Salmonella attorneys are investigating a Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak that has sickened 78 people, including 10 from Ohio:

 A 7-year-old boy from Warren County who was sickened in April An 11-year-old girl from Montgomery County who was sickened in June Three people in Cuyahoga County One person each in Franklin, Lake, Lorain, Lucas and Summit Counties. 

The outbreak has been linked to Cargill ground turkey.“Cargill and others need to be held accountable for the contamination that caused this outbreak,”said food poisoning attorney Fred Pritzker. “No family should have to bear the financial burden of Salmonella poisoning caused by eating ground turkey processed by Cargill.”

Investigators found ground turkey products contaminated with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. In response to the evidence found in the investigation, Cargill Value Added Meats Retail, a business of Wichita-based Cargill Meat Solutions Corp., recalled about 36 million pounds of fresh and frozen ground turkey products produced at the company’s Springdale, Arkansas, processing plant between Feb. 20 and Aug. 2.

The Cargill recall includes ground turkey sold under the following brands:

 Honeysuckle Kroger Riverside Safeway Fit and Active Shady Brook Farms Spartan 

Ohio Salmonella Victim Compensation

Our experience is that even with“mild”cases, Salmonella victims suffer severe abdominal pain, are unable to work for days or weeks and continue to have digestive and bowel issues for weeks, months or permanently. In some cases, the severity of the Salmonella gastroenteritis causes irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and/or Rieter’s syndrome, a form of arthritis that causes inflammation of joints that may be accompanied by conjunctivitis (an inflammation of the membranes under the eyelids that can lead to blindness), urethritis (urinary tract infection), and a rash.

Salmonella victim compensation should include amounts for medical expenses, lost wages and other income, pain and suffering and other damages. Because it may take months or years for some Salmonella victims to recover, compensation should include amounts for expected future medical expenses, losses, and pain and suffering. Contact our law firm for a free consultation if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a Salmonella Heidelberg infection.

 Pennsylvania Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Cargill Turkey - Attorneys Investigating 
 Posted on August 8, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Five people from Pennsylvania contracted Salmonella Heidelberg infections in an outbreak that has been linked to Cargill ground turkey. The victims include 4 from Allegheny County and one from Philadelphia.

Our Salmonella attorneys are investigating this outbreak, which includes 78 people in 26 states.“The victims of this outbreak have suffered physical and financial pain, and they deserve compensation,”said food poisoning attorney Fred Pritzker.“What makes this outbreak worse than many Salmonella outbreaks is that the Salmonella Heidelberg strain is resistant to several antibiotics.”

The victims in Pennsylvania range from 2 to 43 years old and were infected between early April and mid-June.

Cargill Value Added Meats Retail, a business of Wichita-based Cargill Meat Solutions Corp., announced Wednesday that the company would voluntarily recall about 36 million pounds of fresh and frozen ground turkey products produced at the company’s Springdale, Arkansas, processing plant between Feb. 20 and Aug. 2.

The Cargill turkey recall includes products sold at the following Pennsylvania retailers:

 Aldi Giant Eagle Kroger 

Ground turkey products that are subject to this recall were sold under the following brands:

 Honeysuckle Kroger Riverside Safeway Fit and Active Shady Brook Farms Spartan 

Salmonella Pain and Suffering

Our experience is that even with“mild”cases, Salmonella victims suffer severe abdominal pain, are unable to work for days or weeks and continue to have digestive and bowel issues for weeks, months or permanently. In some cases, the severity of the Salmonella gastroenteritis causes irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and/or Rieter’s syndrome , a form of arthritis that causes inflammation of joints that may be accompanied by conjunctivitis (an inflammation of the membranes under the eyelids that can lead to blindness), urethritis (urinary tract infection), and a rash.

Pain and suffering compensation in a Cargill lawsuit or class action should include amounts for expected future pain and suffering. Contact our law firm for a free consultation if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Salmonella Heidelberg.

 California Salmonella Death From Turkey 
 Posted on August 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A California Salmonella death topped the list of tragedies in the Cargill turkey Salmonella outbreak that sickend at least 78 people in 26 states. Nearly 40 percent of those were hospitalized.

Initial reports identified the deceased victim as a man, but Sacramento County officials announced late this week that the person who died was a 65-year-old woman who lived in the county. The date of the woman&apos;s death was not released, nor was her name. She was one of six California case patients in the outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg that USDA and CDC officials traced to Cargill&apos;s Springdale, Arkansas, ground turkey plant.

The company has recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey products produced there since February and the plant has been shutdown while public health investigators continue to investigate the source of the contamination. California, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania were the states hardest hit by the outbreak. 

Cargill distributed the tainted turkey meat nationwide through Kroger, Walmart , Aldi, Giant Eagle, HEB, Ingles, Meijer, Stater Brothers and WinCo . It is the second largest meat recall by sheer tonnage, but most of the ground turkey products surely had been consumed by the time Cargill realized its failure to sell wholesome food.

A claims center for a Cargill Salmonella lawsuit has been established by PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or contact via the Internet . Salmonella infection, or Salmonellosis , can create long-lasting health problems. Indivduals who are confirmed as case patients in this outbreak have recourse through food poisoning litigation to recover money for medical bills, pain and suffering, lost income, travel, day care and related future costs. PritzkerOlsen has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning and we have gone up against Cargill in previous outbreaks. Our offices in Minneapolis are located close to Cargill&apos;s worldwide headquarters in a western suburb of Minneapolis.

 Turkey Salmonella Lawyer Questions Cargill&apos;s Response to Contamination 
 Posted on August 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker is questioning the prolonged length of time between the commencement of the ground turkey Salmonella outbreak in early March and Cargill&apos;s 36-million pound recall on August 3.

 &quot;The whole idea is you are supposed to detect the problem before people get sick,&apos;&apos; Pritzker told the Star Tribune newspaper of Minneapolis. 

 Tough questions are being raised around the country by Pritzker and others about why consumers were not warned earlier of the outbreak, which led to a Salmonella death of a woman in Sacramento County, California, and sickened at least 77 others in 26 states. Nearly 40 percent of case patients were hospitalized and doctors have reported that the outbreak strain has been resistant to some commonly prescribed antibiotics.

USA Today reporter Elizabeth Weisse, a veteran of covering foodborne illness outbreaks, noted in a story today that the recall happened a full 13 days after government officials&quot;connected most of the dots linking the Salmonella outbreak to a turkey grinding plant in Springdale, Arkansas.&apos;&apos; USDA first contacted Cargil July 29 with findings that associated the Arkansas plant with the outbreak. At that time, a ground turkey Salmonella warning was issued, but Cargill was not named and the recall was delayed until August 3.

Pritzker, a leading advocate for victims of food poisoning, has launched an investigation to determine plant conditions that led to contamination of so many finished turkey products over such a long time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started to collect evidence of the outbreak in March. The recall of adulterated turkey dates back to February.

 Salmonella  lawyers at Pritzker&apos;s law firm have established a claims center for victims -- a clearinghouse for  Cargill lawsuit information  -- available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting your  contact information . One of the leading practitioners of foodborne illness litigation in the United States, PritzkerOlsen is based near the worldwide headquarters of Cargill and has gone up against the multinational conglomerate in previous outbreaks. Over the years we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of Salmonella poisoning.

 Cargill Lawsuit Options Weighed in 26-State Salmonella Heidelberg Outbreak 
 Posted on August 4, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is urging consumers to check their freezers for ground turkey products that may be contaminated and unsafe as part of the Cargill Salmonella outbreak. One person has died and at least 77 others have been sickened. Nearly 40 percent of those infected by the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg have been hospitalized. Treatment options have been limited because the pathogen in this outbreak is resistant to some commonly prescribed antibiotics.

 Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen have established a claims center for victims -- a clearinghouse for Cargill lawsuit information -- available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting your contact information . One of the leading practitioners of foodborne illness litigation in the United States, PritzkerOlsen is based near the worldwide headquarters of Cargill and has gone up against the multinational conglomerate in previous outbreaks.

Cargill this week acknowledged the link between its ground turkey products and the outbreak, recalling 36 million pounds of product made in Arkansas since February. Much of that has been eaten or returned to Cargill by retailers, but some still lurks in home freezers of consumers who are now at risk for becoming seriously ill.

The tainted ground turkey was sold under the Honeysuckle White brand and several other brands. Cargill&apos;s Springdale, Arkansas, plant sold the potentially tainted meat through the following retailers and corresponding locations:

 1. Aldi, Nationwide 

 2. Giant Eagle, locations in PA, MD, WV and OH  

 3. HEB, locations in TX  

 4. Ingles, locations in SC, NC, AL, GA, TN and VA  

 5. Kroger, Nationwide  

 6. Meijer, locations in MI, IL, KY, IN and OH  

 7. Stater Brothers, locations in CA  

 8. Walmart, Nationwide  

 9. WinCo, locations in WA, ID, NE, CA and OR  

 The products subject to recall bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection.

PritzkerOlsen is continuing to investigate the outbreak, as are federal officials at USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 Cargill Turkey Salmonella Outbreak Prompts Temporary Shutdown of Plant 
 Posted on August 4, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Plant conditions are under investigation at Cargill, where ground turkey is linked to a Salmonella death and a 26-state outbreak of illnesses. The multinational food giant, based in Minnesota, shut down its Springdale, Arkansas, plant after USDA and CDC linked it to the outbreak. Cases are widespread but these states were hit hardest: Ohio, Michigan, Texas, Illinois, California and Pennsylvania. 

 USDA said 79 people are considered case patients in the outbreak and that number could grow because contaminated product may still be in consumers&apos; freezers. Kroger and Safeway are among the retail chains that sold the meat, but a comprehensive list of where the products were sold has not yet been released.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., which is based near Cargill&apos;s worldwide headquarters, is in contact with victims of this outbreak as it prepares for a possible turkey Salmonella lawsuit. Families and individuals sickened by this release of contamination into the food supply can discuss their legal options with a Salmonella lawyer at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by submitting basic  contact information .  Our firm has taken on Cargill in the past and won and we have collected tens of millions of dollars over the years for food poisoning victims from all over the country. 

 Salmonellosis is not to be taken lightly. Infection by this pathogen can lead to chronic health conditions that are serious in nature for years following initial illness. Food poisoning in the U.S. is preventable and holding mega-producers accountable for selling food that makes people sick is necessary to keep the system in check.

Honeysuckle White and other brands of ground turkey from the plant were sold nationwide for months. Cargill admits in a news release that these products may have been contaminated with Salmonella Heidelberg, a strain that is resistant to some commonly prescribed antibiotics. Certainly, much of the meat already has been consumed, but USDA announced that Cargill is now recalling 36 million pounds of ground turkey products made at the Arkansas plant since February 20.

 Salmonella , like other pathogens, harbors in the intestines of turkeys, chickens and other live animals and is spread via fecal matter or when stomach contents are spread onto meat during slaughtering. Cargill operates three other turkey plants that won&apos;t be shut down during the Arkansas inspection and investigation. USDA said it is continuing to investigate.

 Cargill Turkey Salmonella Investigation Continues After Initial Recall 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Federal food safety agencies are striving to assemble a retail distribution list to accompany Cargill&apos;s recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey products after the meat was linked to a 26-state outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg. 

Texas, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are the hardest hit states in terms of turkey Salmonella victims -- accounting for nearly half of the 79 illnesses. The outbreak has, so far, resulted in one death -- a man who lived in California.

USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced the massive recall, saying that the link between Cargill ground turkey products and the Salmonella outbreak was based on epidemiology, traceback investigations and&quot;in-plant findings&apos;&apos; at Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. of Springdale, Arkansas.

 The notice from FSIS said it is continuing to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), affected state public health partners and the company on the investigation. No other details of the probe were released. 

The detailed recall includes a variety of bulk ground turkey sold in chubs and trays as well as patties. The recalled turkey burger contains various levels of fat content. Some packages were unbranded while some carried brand names like Honeysuckle White, Spartan, Shady Brook Farms, Kroger and Safeway. 

The one thing all the products have in common is that they bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection.

If you or a loved one was hospitalized or otherwise sickened in this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or submit contact information for a free case consultation. Our law firm is one of the very few in the country that practices extensively in the area of foodborne illness and we have direct experience in handling claims against Cargill, a multi-national food and commodities corporation based near our headquarters.

Eventually, USDA hopes to publish a list of retail stores where the tainted turkey products were sold. Distribution was nationwide, USDA has said.

 Cargill Ground Turkey Salmonella Lawsuit Likely to Result From Outbreak Finding 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Cargill has been linked to the turkey Salmonella outbreak that has killed a California man and sickened at least 78 others in 26 states, including Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Texas . The announcement by USDA coincided with a Cargill turkey recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey products. See details below. 

Cargill is based in Minnesota, not far from the law offices of PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the leading food poisoning litigation practices in the country. PritzkerOlsen has been accepting cases from the Cargill turkey Salmonella outbreak and will continue to prepare for a turkey Salmonella lawsuit on behalf of the families and individuals who have been infected by the contaminated meat. There are free case consultations by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Or, a Salmonella lawyer will call you if you submit your contact information .  

USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said the link between Cargill ground turkey products and the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak was established by traceback investigations, as well as in-plant findings at Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. of Springdale, Arkansas. The outbreak strain of Salmonella is resistant to some commonly prescribed antibiotics, a factor that has complicated treatment for victims of this outbreak.

Federal, state and local health investigators had been scrambling to determine what brand of ground turkey was causing the outbreak, which began in early March. Food history surveys and interviews with victims of the outbreak had determined that consumption of contaminated ground turkey was causing the spread of infection, but no one knew where the tainted food was coming from.

 

The Cargill ground turkey products subject to recall were distributed nationwide and bear the establishment number&quot;P-963&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. They include the following:

 Salmonella And Antibiotic Resistance 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The recent Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak linked to ground turkey has been characterized by an alarming discovery. The strain of Salmonella that has sickened 77 people in 26 states and killed one is, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&quot;resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics; this antibiotic resistance can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.&quot;

The topic of drug-resistant Salmonella is not limited to this outbreak. Recently, CBS News reported on another strain called Salmonella Kentucky. A recent European study published in the Journal of Infectious Disease shows that it is resistant to common antibiotics. According to the report, the pathogen made nearly 500 people sick between 2000 and 2008 in France, England, Wales and Denmark. It was usually associated with chicken. According to study author Dr. Simon Le Hello, of the Pasteur Institute in France:
 
&quot;We hope that this publication might stir awareness among national and international health, food, and agricultural authorities so that they take the necessary measures to control and stop the dissemination of this strain before it spreads globally, as did another multidrug-resistant strain of Salmonella, Typhimurium DT104, starting in the 1990s.&quot;
 
The study recommends that International public health surveillance systems are needed to limit the spread of such multidrug-resistant organisms.

 Threat of Reiter&apos;s Syndrome Underlies Salmonella Turkey Outreak in U.S. 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The ongoing   turkey Salmonella outbreak in Ohio, Michigan, Texas, Illinois and 22 other states carries with it the threat that some victims will develop serious complications and chronic illness -- the most prominent of which is Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. 

 Salmonella is a bacterial pathogen that causes diarrhea and fever but can also result in  Salmonella -induced chronic conditions such as aseptic reactive arthritis and Reiter‘s Syndrome, which is a combination of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. The first symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset Salmonella&apos;s acute symptoms of fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.. 
 In these patients, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.   With help from the National Institutes of Health, law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has assembled the following details about Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. Salmonella lawsuits we have filed in the past have benefitted victims of this dreaded complication of foodborne illness. It also can result from Campylobacter and other forms of food poisoning. Our firm is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in food poisoning litigation and we are currently accepting cases from the  Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak that the CDC warns is being caused by consumption of contaminated ground turkey.    In cases of Reiter&apos;s Syndrome, urinary symptoms usually appear within days or weeks of an infection. Low-grade fever, inflammation of the of the eye (conjunctivitis), and arthritis develop over the next several weeks. The arthritis may be mild or severe, and may affect only one side of the body or more than one joint.   Muscle and joint symptoms include: 
 Achilles tendon pain Heel pain Joint pain in the large joints (hip pain, knee pain, and ankle pain are common) Low back pain 
 Eye and skin symptoms include: 
 Eye discharge Eye pain - burning Eye redness Skin lesions on the palms and soles that may resemble psoriasis Small, painless ulcers in the mouth, tongue, and glans penis 
 Urinary and genital symptoms may include: 
 Genital lesions (male) Incontinence Penis pain Skin redness or inflammation Urethral discharge Urinary hesitancy Urinary urgency Urination - burning or stinging 
 Reiter&apos;s Syndrome may go away in a few weeks, but can last for a few months or become chronic. Symptoms may return over a period of several years in up to half of the people affected.    Contact a physician or go directly to a medical facility to receive treatment for Reiter&apos;s Syndrome or any other complications that stem from Salmonella infection. For answers to legal questions about filing a claim for compensation, contact law firm PritzkerOlsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Or, send your contact information to our firm and a Salmonella lawyer will call you. Consultations are free and we don&apos;t get paid until you win your case.

 Michigan Turkey Salmonella Toll at 10 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Michigan&apos;s top food poisoning investigator says there may be more than 10 Michigan residents infected by the turkey Salmonella outbreak that federal health officials say has caused one Salmonella death in California and sickened at least 77 others in 26 states. 
 Officially, 10 Michigan cases have been counted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the most in any one state. Ohio also has 10, Texas has nine and Illinois has seven. Susan Bohm, state epidemiologist in Michigan, told the Detroit Free Press that more cases are expected in Michigan and probably elsewhere -- in part because ground turkey can be frozen and consumed later.   The CDC, USDA, state and local health investigators are scrambling to identify what brand of ground turkey or what turkey plant produced the contaminated meat. When they succeed, a recall will be issued and consumers will know which stocks to avoid. For now, the CDC is warning consumers to handle ground turkey with extra care to prevent cross contamination of kitchen surfaces or utensils. Also, the only sure way to kill the organisms -- if present in the meat -- is to cook it to at least 165 degrees, verified using a thermometer. Extra care is urged when preparing foods for infants, older adults, and persons with impaired immune systems. Those are the individuals most at risk for serious illness and death.   At least 10 of the Michigan case patients live in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, according to the Free Press. The four other Michigan counties with known Salmonella victims include: 
 Genesee County (1) Bay County (1) Berrien County (1) Eaton County (1) 
 According to the Michigan Department of Community Health, the case patients became infected between May 7 through July 2.   Nationally, the outbreak cases began to appear March 9. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 88 years old, with a median age of 23 years old. Forty-eight percent are female. Among the 58 ill persons with available information, 38 percent have been hospitalized.    The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg is resistant to some antibiotics, which can increase the risk of hospitalization, treatment failure (wrongful death) and future medical issues. Families and individuals who believe they have been sickened by contaminated ground turkey should immediately see a physician. Salmonella should not be taken lightly and is proven to have long-lasting medical complications in some people, including reactive arthritis or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.   For assistance in making a legal claim as part of a likely turkey Salmonella lawsuit , contact a Salmonella attorney at PritzkerOlsen, P.A. Free case consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free), or send us your contact information . Our law firm is one of the few in the country that practices extensively in the complicated area of foodborne illness litigation.

 Salmonella Death in California from Contaminated Turkey 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A California man is the first person to die in the 26-state Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak associated with ground turkey products. The man lived in Sacramento, according to California health officials. Five other people in California were also sickened in the outbreak.

California counties with Salmonella victims include:

 Sacramento (2) Los Angeles (1) San Francisco (1) Riverside (1) San Diego (1). 

State and federal health officials have only warned consumers about this outbreak and the possible link to ground turkey. There has not been a recall of potentially contaminated products, nor have health officials let the public know the products involved in the outbreak to prevent illness. This is particularly troubling because the Salmonella Heidelberg strain involved in this outbreak is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics . This antibiotic resistance can increase the risk of hospitalization, treatment failure (wrongful death) and future medical issues.

This is the second time this year that ground turkey has been linked to a Salmonella outbreak. From December 2010 to March of 2011, 12 people, including one from California, were sickened by Jennie-O frozen turkey burgers contaminated with drug-resistant Salmonella Hadar . In response to the outbreak, on April 1, 2011, Jennie-O Turkey Store®, in Willmar, Minnesota, recalled approximately 54,960 pounds of frozen, raw turkey burger products.

 Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are investigating this outbreak for a possible turkey Salmonella lawsuit. Our firm is accepting cases from California and other states. To pursue a claim, individuals and families who have been affected by the outbreak may call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or provide us with your contact information . PritzkerOlsen is one of the few law firms in the U.S. that practices extensively in the area of foodborne illness and our attorneys are sought after for appearances at food safety conferences and by national health reporters covering outbreaks of foodborne illness.

 Antibiotic-Resistant Salmonella in Turkey Results in Illness and Wrongful Death - CA, IL, MI, OH, PA and TX Hardest Hit 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak associated with ground turkey has sickened 77 people in 26 states. The strain of Salmonella Heidelberg involved in this outbreak is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics. This antibiotic resistance increased the severity of infections, resulting in 22 people hospitalized, a high number for a Salmonella outbreak of this size. The antibiotic resistance also led to treatment failure and the death of one Salmonella Heidelberg victim. 

When a strain of Salmonella is resistant to several antibiotics, it is called a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of Salmonella. The rates of multidrug-resistance in Salmonella have increased considerably in recent years.  Salmonella Heidelberg is one of the Salmonella serotypes more prone to develop resistance.

Increased Risk of Infection and Death for Salmonella Heidelberg Victims

Antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg can result in any of the following:

 Increased frequency of treatment failure Increased severity of infection Increased frequency of bloodstream infections Increased hospitalization Increased mortality. 

People with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Salmonella have been found to be more likely to have bloodstream infection or die within 90 days. 1 One study found that the death rate for persons with multidrug-resistant infections was estimated to be 10 times higher in the two years following specimen collection than for the general population. 2 

What this means is that the Salmonella Heidelberg victims in this outbreak should seek compensation for this increased risk in addition to compensation for medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering and other damages. Contact our attorneys for a free consultation .

The following states are involved in this Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (6), Georgia (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (7), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (10), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), North Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota(3), Tennessee (2), Texas (9), and Wisconsin (3).

 Turkey Salmonella Outbreak in Illinois 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Seven people from Illinois are case patients in the turkey Salmonella outbreak that has sickened 77 people in 26 states. Ground turkey has been implicated as the cause of this outbreak in Illinois, Ohio and other states. But as of yet the investigation has not identified the brand name or the manufacturing plant where the meat came from.

The Illinois Department of Public Health, along with local health departments in Illinois, are collaborating with the CDC and USDA to investigate. The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg is resistant to some antibiotics. Any potential information on the contamination source will come from the USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service, the primary regulator for meat.

Nationally, the turkey outbreak has caused one Salmonella death and the illnesses have occurred since the first day of March. The outbreak is ongoing. Of the seven cases in Illinois with the same type of Salmonella as the outbreak, at least one person has been hospitalized. Reports of illness in Illinois started on March 21, 2011, with the most recent case patient becoming ill on June 29. Case patients range in age from 3 to 60 years and were reported in Cass County, Cook County, DuPage County, Madison County, Peoria County, Will County and Williamson County. This area encompasses Chicago and other Illinois cities. 
 Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are investigating this outbreak for a possible turkey Salmonella lawsuit. Our firm is accepting cases from Illinois, Ohio and other states. To pursue a claim, individuals and families who have been affected by the outbreak may call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or provide us with your contact information . PritzkerOlsen is one of the few law firms in the U.S. that practices extensively in the area of foodborne illness and our attorneys are sought after for appearances at food safety conferences and by national health reporters covering outbreaks of foodborne illness.

 Salmonella Turkey Outbreak in Ohio 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Ohio is part of the turkey Salmonella outbreak under investigation by the Centers for Disease Control, state health departments and local offices. The Ohio Department of Health reports 10 cases occurred between April 22 and June 26, including three cases in Cuyahoga County.

 Ohio turkey Salmonella cases also have been reported in Franklin, Lake, Lorian, Lucas, Montgomery, Summit and Warren counties, the Columbus Dispatch reported. They are all part of the multi-state outbreak that the CDC reports has sickened 77 people in 26 states. So far there has been one Salmonella death in the outbreak, but not in Ohio.

Public health officials in Ohio and beyond are working to identify the precise source, but ground turkey has been implicated. The brand of ground turkey or the plant where it was packaged is not known at this time. Therefore, this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg has not yet prompted any turkey recall.
 Families and individuals affected by this outbreak are urged to call PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food safety law firm that has won tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning. A Salmonella lawyer with expertise in the area of foodborne illness will provide a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or in response to your contact information.   Unfortunately for victims of this outbreak, the strain of Salmonella causing infections is resistant to some antibiotics -- a situation that results in prolonged and costlier treatments. Seeking compensation for those medical bills is only part of what is involved in making a proper claim to settle damages caused by the contaminated food.

 Salmonella Wrongful Death Associated with Ground Turkey 
 Posted on August 1, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Our attorneys are investigating a Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak that has sickened 77 people in 26 states. One of the Salmonella victims died.

The epidemiological and microbiological evidence points to ground turkey as the source of the outbreak. According to the CDC, among the 51 ill persons with available information, 25 (49%) reported consuming ground turkey. Cultures of four ground turkey samples purchased from four retail locations between March 7 and June 27, 2011 yielded Salmonella Heidelberg with the outbreak strain. Each Salmonella outbreak involves a unique strain of Salmonella.

&quot;What I have found is that families want to hold companies responsible for selling contaminated food,&quot;said Salmonella attorney Fred Pritzker .&quot;The family of the Salmonella victim who died in this outbreak has a legal right to pursue compensation for their loss and get some measure of justice.&quot;

 Salmonella Heidelberg strains show higher rates of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Ground turkey processors know this and should take every measure to make sure that the meat is not contaminated with the pathogen. &quot;A bite of a turkey burger should not kill someone,&quot;said Pritzker.

Attorney Fred Pritzker has successfully represented families in Salmonella wrongful death cases and is available for a free consultation . He has a national practice and represents Salmonella victims throughout the United States.

States involved in this outbreak include the following: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (6), Georgia (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (7), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (10), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), North Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota(3), Tennessee (2), Texas (9), and Wisconsin (3). Of those sickened, at least 22 have been hospitalized.

This is the second Salmonella outbreak in 2011 associated with ground turkey. A Salmonella Hadar outbreak in late 2010 and early 2011 was associated with consuming turkey burgers from Jennie-O Turkey Store, a Minnesota company. As of April 1, 2011, 12 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Hadar were reported from 10 states: Arizona (1 case), California (1 case), Colorado (1 case), Georgia (1 case), Illinois (1 case), Missouri (1 case), Mississippi (1 case), Ohio (1 case), Washington (1 case), and Wisconsin (3 cases).

 CDC Update on Turkey Salmonella Outbreak in California, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and 22 Other States 
 Posted on August 1, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The CDC has released its first update on the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak linked to ground turkey that has sickened 77 people in 26 states between March 1 and August 1, 2011. One person has died.

&quot;This outbreak could have been prevented with better sanitation and pathogen testing,&quot;said Fred Pritzker, lead attorney for our Salmonella lawsuits .&quot;A bite of a turkey burger should not send someone to the hospital. These victims and their families deserve compensation, and the processor of the ground turkey needs to be held accountable.&quot;

The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (6), Georgia (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (7), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (10), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), North Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota(3), Tennessee (2), Texas (9), and Wisconsin (3).

People sickened range in age from less than 1 year to 88 years old, with a median age of 23 years old. Among the 58 ill persons with available information, 22 (38%) have been hospitalized. This is an extremely high number of hospitalizations for a Salmonella outbreak.

One death has been reported. The family of this victim can pursue a Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit against the companies legally responsible for the death.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing. Cultures of four ground turkey samples purchased from four retail locations between March 7 and June 27, 2011 yielded Salmonella Heidelberg with the outbreak strain. Preliminary information indicates that three of these products originated from a common production establishment; the fourth is still under investigation. These were obtained as part of routine sampling in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) , and have not been linked to illnesses. Product information (such as date and location of purchase of ground turkey) is also being collected from ill persons and is being used by local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies to conduct traceback investigations.

 Salmonella Heidelberg Outbreak and Ground Turkey 
 Posted on July 30, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Our attorneys are investigating a Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak that has been associated with ground turkey. At least 77 people in 26 states have laboratory-confirmed cases of Salmonella Heidelberg linked through an epidemiologic investigation and PFGE (DNA) analyses . Others may also be part of this outbreak. At least 22 people have been hospitalized, and one person has died.

 Salmonella Heidelberg strains are often associated with food poisoning and show higher rates of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. One study found 1 :

One hundred eighty S. enterica serovar Heidelberg isolates,collected from turkey-associated production and processing sources,were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, and compared bypulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid profileanalysis. The potential for the transfer of resistance betweenstrains was studied by conjugation experiments. Xba I-digestedPFGE analysis identified eight clusters (based on an 90% similarity),with the largest containing 71% of the isolates. Forty-two percentof the isolates were resistant to at least one of the 15 antimicrobialagents tested and 4% of the isolates were resistant to eightor more antimicrobial agents. Resistance was most commonly detectedto streptomycin (32%), tetracycline (30%) and kanamycin (24%).Interestingly, the XbaI PFGE profiles of selective multidrugresistant strains (n=22) of S. enterica serovar Heidelberg fromturkey-associated sources were indistinguishable from the predominantprofile (JF6X01.0022), detected in isolates associated withhuman infections. These isolates were further differentiatedinto seven distinct profiles following digestion with Bln I enzyme,with the largest cluster compromising of 15 isolates from veterinarydiagnostic and turkey processing environments. Conjugation experimentsindicated that resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents wastransferable among strains with diverse PFGE profiles. 

 Salmonella Heidelberg food poisoning causes an infection called salmonellosis . This can cause gastroenteritis and serious illness. In some cases, salmonellosis can develop into bacteremia, an infection of the blood. When this happens, the Salmonella bacteria can be carried to other parts of the body by the blood cells and cause serious injury or death.

 Salmonella bacteremia can result in one or more of the following focal infections:

 Osteomyelitis (infection of the bones or bone marrow) Meningitis (infection of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord) Pyelonepritis (a urinary tract infection that infects the kidneys that may be referred to as urosepsis when severe and may be called pyelitis) Endocarditis (infection of the endocardium, the inner layer of the heart that may include infection of the heart valves) Myocarditis (infection of the heart muscle) Vascular infections (infection of the blood vessels) Pancreatitis (infection of the pancreas) Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) 

The above infections are all life-threatening, and some have extremely high mortality rates. Read about a Salmonella death lawsuit .

 Salmonella bacteremia can also cause either septic arthritis or reactive arthritis ( Reiter&apos;s syndrome ).

The Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak associated with ground turkey has sickened people in the following states: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (6), Georgia (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (7), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (10), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), North Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota(3), Tennessee (2), Texas (9), and Wisconsin (3).

 Ground Turkey Salmonella Outbreak in 26 States 
 Posted on July 30, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak has been associated with the use and consumption of ground turkey. At least 77 people in 26 states have been sickened. Of those, 22 were hospitalized and one person died. The illnesses were linked and ground turkey was implicated through an epidemiologic investigation and PFGE analyses by state health departments and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

&quot;These people need immediate relief from financial burdens caused by the contaminated ground turkey products,&quot;said Fred Pritzker, lead attorney for our Salmonella cases .&quot;They also deserve compensation for the severe pain they endured.&quot;

The number of people sickened in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (6), Georgia (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (7), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (10), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), North Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota(3), Tennessee (2), Texas (9), and Wisconsin (3).

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis , one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly and persons with HIV infection or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

 Salmonella Papaya Cases Highly Concentrated in Chicago, Illinois Area, Officials Say 
 Posted on July 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 In the recent Salmonella Agona outbreak linked to papayas, at least 99 people in 23 states were sickened, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ten people have been hospitalized.

Of those hospitalizations, 8 were in the Chicago, Illinois area. “For some people, Salmonella food poisoning might mean severe flu-like symptoms that eventually pass. But for others, it can mean serious illness or even death,”said Salmonella attorney Brendan Flaherty.“Our firm has represented people seriously sickened and killed by Salmonella poisoning. It’s important for those injured to receive the justice they deserve, and also to let companies know they can’t get away with selling contaminated products.”

There are 17 people sick in Illinois, with most of the illnesses concentrated in Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Counties affected include DuPage, Kane, Lake, Will and Winnebago. The number of illnesses, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, are broken down as follows: Chicago-5, Cook County-4, DuPage County-4, Kane-1, Lake County-1, Will County-1 and Winnebago County-1.

The Salmonella Agona cases have been linked to papayas imported and distributed by Agromod Produce, Inc.., a McAllen, Texas company. The company issued a recall of papayas after samples of their papayas tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella. The recall involves Blondie, Yaya, Mañanita, and Tastylicious Brand papayas sold prior to July 23, 2011.

People who think they may be sick with Salmonella should visit a doctor and have a stool sample tested to confirm whether Salmonella is the actual pathogen making them sick. People who have a culture-confirmed case of Salmonella and have recently eaten papaya may be part of this outbreak. Speaking with a health care provider and contacting your local health department can help you determine if your illness is part of this outbreak. If you have questions about this, contact our law firm for a free consultation.

 Salmonella papaya outbreak victims may be able to file a lawsuit against Agromod Produce and others . A Salmonella lawsuit requires a lawyer who has experience investigating the microbiological and epidemiological evidence involved in a foodborne illness case. Our lawyers have recovered millions of dollars on behalf of people sickened by Salmonella and other food poisoning pathogens. Contact them for a free consultation today .

 Papaya Lawsuit: Salmonella Outbreak in Illinois, Texas, Georgia, Nebraska and Other States 
 Posted on July 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Pritzker Olsen is a national Salmonella law firm for victims of the Salmonella Agona outbreak who ate contaminated papayas and want to file a lawsuit against Agromod Produce, Inc. of Texas, the distributor of recalled papayas . Compensation for victims who file a papaya lawsuit may include amounts for any of the following:

 Hospital bills and other medical expenses Lost income Pain and suffering Emotional distress Disability Loss of quality of life Other damages. 

A Salmonella lawsuit should seek full and fair compensation. This includes amounts for expected future medical expenses, losses and pain. The value of each case depends on the facts. Our advantage as experienced Salmonella lawyers is that we know what cases are worth, and we have successfully negotiated with many of the insurance companies that insure food manufacturers, distributors and restaurants. Money to pay the Salmonella claims usually comes from the insurance company.

Papaya Salmonella Outbreak Associated with Agromod Produce

A multistate outbreak of Salmonella Agona infections has been linked to whole, fresh imported papayas. Public health investigators are using DNA“fingerprints”of Salmonella bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. 

A total of 99 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona have been reported from 23 states between January 1 and July 22, 2011. The number of ill persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as follows: Arkansas (1), Arizona (3), California (7), Colorado (1), Georgia (8), Illinois (17), Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (1), Minnesota (3), Missouri (3), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (3), New York (7), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (2), Tennessee (1), Texas (25), Virginia (2), Washington (5), and Wisconsin (2).

Among persons for whom information is available, illnesses began on or after January 17, 2011. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year old to 91 years old, and the median age is 19 years old. Forty-one percent of patients are younger than 5 years old. Sixty percent are female. Eleven persons reported travel to Mexico in the week before they became ill. Ten patients were hospitalized. 

Eight of the ten people hospitalized in this outbreak were from Illinois. Nine additional people in Illinois were sickened but where not hospitalized (these people may still have claims against Agromod and others). The count in Illinois is as follows:

 Chicago–5 cases Cook County–4 cases DuPage County–4 cases Kane County–1 case Lake County–1 case Will County–1 case Winnebago County –1 case.

 Baylor University Food Expert Warns against Consumption of Raw Eggs 
 Posted on July 20, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Suzy Weems, Ph.D., a national food expert and chair of Baylor University&apos;s family and consumer sciences department, is warning people not to be fooled by Internet sites expounding the benefits of eating raw eggs. This is from a Baylor University news article:

A flurry of Internet sites are touting raw egg drinks or shakes as&quot;primal and powerful,&quot;with others suggesting uncooked eggs be blended with vanilla or avocado for a tasty, healthy snack and still others insisting that the connection between raw eggs and salmonella is a myth.

Suzy Weems, Ph.D., a national food expert and chair of Baylor University&apos;s family and consumer sciences department, has this word for health-seekers: Leave no egg uncooked.

&quot;Under no circumstances eat a raw egg,&quot;says Weems, a registered dietitian and a past chair of the American Dietetic Association&apos;s legislative and public policy committee.

 Read the full article. 

We could not agree more. Attorneys Fred Pritzker, Brendan Flaherty and Ryan Osterholm recently settled several cases involving Salmonella poisoning from eggs.

 Chicks, Ducklings and Salmonella 
 Posted on June 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Chicks, ducklings and Salmonella have combined to form an outbreak of infectious disease that, so far, has infected 39 individuals in 15 states -- including eight in Ohio, six in North Carolina and four in Kentucky. The animals were purchased as egg producers for backyard flocks or as pets.

Twenty-eight percent of the chick Salmonella outbreak victims have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. Traceback investigations have determined that many of the contaminated chicks and ducklings were purchased from the same nationwide agricultural feed store chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a single mail-order hatchery was involved in the supply chain. Neither the store nor the hatchery were identified. 

The number and home state of persons ill from the outbreak strain of Salmonella Altona are: Georgia (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (4), Michigan (1), Maryland (3), Minnesota (1), North Carolina (6), New York (2), Ohio (8), Pennsylvania (4), Tennessee (2), Virginia (3), Vermont (1), Wisconsin (1), and West Virginia (1).

 Posted on June 7, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella food poisoning is defying U.S. prevention efforts even while progress is being made to stop a more feared pathogen: E. coli O157:H7 . Those are the headlines from an annual report on foodborne illness produced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 The report found broad declines in several foodborne infections, including E. coli O157:H7. But Salmonella infections, which cause the largest numbers of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths of any pathogen under surveillance in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), have not declined during the past decade, the CDC said. FoodNet conducts surveillance among 15 percent of the U.S. population for laboratory-confirmed infections with nine pathogens transmitted commonly through food.  
 Salmonella infection was the most common: 17.6 illnesses per 100,000 persons. It also had the largest number of hospitalizations (2,290) and deaths (29). Incidence was highest in children less than 5 years old and 5 percent of infections were associated with recognized outbreaks. According to the CDC, the incidence of  Salmonella  infection in 2010 was not significantly different than during 1996--1998 but was significantly higher than during 2006--2008 -- on the order of a 10 percent increase. And of the 7,564  Salmonella  isolates serotyped by FoodNet, the most common serotypes were Enteritidis (22%), Newport (14%), and Typhimurium (13%).  By comparison, the rate of  E. coli  O157 cases reported by FoodNet sites was .9 cases per 100,000 people, down substantially from 1997 when FoodNet measured 2 cases per 100,000 people. The nearly 50 percent reduction in  E. coli  O157 incidence is considered significant when compared to the lack of change in  Salmonella  incidence.   All together, the report said, food poisoning causes an estimated 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths annually in America. Most cases of illness occur in persons who are not part of identified outbreaks, but there are approximately 1,000 reported disease outbreaks per year that are either local, regional or national in scope.

 Portillo&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak in Illinois Associated with Restaurant Salad 
 Posted on May 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Portillo&apos;s helped Salmonella outbreak investigators link 15 illnesses to salad served at the restaurant. The Illinois investigation into the Portillo&apos;s Salmonella outbreak in Kane County centered on the Portillo&apos;s restaurant in St. Charles. 

 A press release from the Kane County Health Department said the investigation is not over .&quot;An exact cause of the outbreak has not been identified; however the weight of evidence leans toward the ingestion of salad,&apos;&apos; the statement said.&quot;It is not known how the salad became contaminated.&apos;&apos; 

 The number of confirmed cases stands at 15, with eight from Kane County, four from 4 DuPage County, one from Chicago, one from DeKalb County, and one from Minnesota. Officials said two employees of the St. Charles Portillo&apos;s were found to be infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium, but they are considered victims of the outbreak -- not the cause.

Ten of the victims are female and all illness started between April 5-30. Three of the infected individuals were hospitalized.

 Illinois Restaurant Salmonella Update 
 Posted on May 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne outbreaks in the United States and about half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings -- including the latest Illinois Salmonella outbreak in Kane County.

 Portillo&apos;s restaurant in St. Charles, Illinois, has been testing employees for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium ever since health investigators determined that seven of the 10 case patients in the outbreak ate there during the month of April. The seven were all sickened by the same genetically matched bacteria; although no link has been made to a specific food or beverage.

The possible Portillo&apos;s Salmonella outbreak is at least the fifth Salmonella outbreak to strike in Illinois since early 2010. The most memorable of those was an outbreak of Salmonellosis that involved people who ate alfalfa sprouts at Jimmy John&apos;s restaurants in at least 14 Illinois counties. 
 
National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is investigating the latest outbreak and has represented past victims of Illinois  Salmonella  outbreaks.To  contact a Salmonella lawyer  about compensation for medical bills, lost wages, daycare expenses, travel, future medical care and other related harms, calls are being taken at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Portillo&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak Investigation Opens in Illinois 
 Posted on May 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw In yet another  Illinois  Salmonella outbreak, seven of 10 case patients ate at Portillo&apos;s restaurant in St. Charles during the month of April, the Kane County Health Department and the Illinois Department of Public Health Laboratories said.   The outbreak strain is known as Salmonella Typhimurium, which health officials elsewhere in northeastern Illinois have noticed in recent illness reports. A press release from Kane County said that in about the past two weeks, 10 cases of Salmonella  Typhimurium with a matching DNA fingerprint have been reported In Illinois. Meanwhile, test results are pending for at least two additional suspected outbreak cases.   Officials describe Portillo&apos;s in St. Charles as a&quot;common potential link,&apos;&apos; noting that the outbreak is still under investigation. No specific food item has been identified to be the source of the illnesses, but management of Portillo&apos;s -- a successful chain restaurant -- is&quot;actively cooperating,&apos;&apos; the press release said. The restaurant was sanitized over night Monday, and is having all its food handlers tested for possible infection.   The Kane County Health Department is recommending a doctor&apos;s visit for anyone who has Salmonella symptoms   For legal questions about possible Salmonella litigation resulting specifically from this outbreak, call PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or  contact us online  and an attorney will call you.

In some cases there are chronic consequences. Arthritic symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. One of the most severe and painful complications is reactive arthritis, or  Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.   Tags: Illinois Salmonella Outbreak , Salmonella , Salmonella Restaurant Attorney , lawsuit&apos; , lawyer&apos; , portillo , restaurant , s

 Zeppole Salmonella Outbreak Prompts Food Safety Introspection in Rhode Island 
 Posted on May 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Rhode Island zeppole Salmonella outbreak that killed two elderly men and sickened more than 75 others has prompted some soul-searching inside the state over whether seven state food safety inspectors can adequately monitor the 8,000 food facilities, including bakeries and restaurants, that are located throughout the state.

 To thoroughly inspect, just once a year, each of the 8,000 places that make or serve food, Rhode Island would need about 26 inspectors doing 300 inspections a year. Neighboring states have far more food safety inspectors per number of institutions that require inspection, according to the Providence Journal.

The zeppole Salmonella outbreak has been associated with baked goods from DeFusco&apos;s, where post-outbreak inspection found multiple food safety problems. The outbreak started in March with the traditional serving of cream-filled zeppole as part of the celebration of the Feast of St. Joseph in the Italian-American community. The first major indication came at a nursing home in Warwick where more than 10 residents fell ill days after DeFusco&apos;s zeppoles were delivered as a treat.

Questions about a zeppole Salmonella lawsuit are being handled by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or online via our contact form . Our legal group is one of the very few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning. We are involved in practically all major outbreaks on behalf of victims and we hold food corporations and insurance companies accountable for the short-term and long-term harms caused by contaminated food.

 DeFusco&apos;s Lawsuit For Salmonella Victims 
 Posted on May 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
As many people consider filing a DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit over Salmonella poisoning, the Rhode Island Department of Health continues to provide updates on the outbreak that started more than a month ago and has been linked to DeFusco&apos;s pastry.

 As of May 2, 2011, the health department&apos;s updated number of total illnesses stood at 79. Of those case patients, 30 were hospitalized and two people tragically suffered Salmonella death . Secondly, the health department told WPRI TV of Providence this week that tests for Salmonella in workers at DeFusco&apos;s came back negative, showing no signs of the bacteria. 

DeFusco&apos;s bakery facilities in Johnston and Cranston have been closed because of the outbreak. Health officials cited the operations for food safety violations that included improper storage temperature of cream filling and improper use of egg crates for holding pastry shells. Inspectors found Salmonella in the crates.

The outbreak remains under investigation and those victims who have questions about a DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit can call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) to speak to a Salmonella attorney at PritzkerOlsen, P.A.. Our firm has years of experience representing those killed or sickened in foodborne illness outbreaks and we have collected tens of millions of dollars for those who have suffered food poisoning.

 Pancake Breakfast Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on April 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Maryland Salmonella outbreak in Thurmont last month has been associated with sausage and meat pudding served at a church pancake breakfast. The Frederick News-Post followed up on the outbreak by interviewing County Health Officer Barbara Brookmyer.

 She told the newspaper that nine of 18 case patients were confirmed to be sickened from the same strain of Salmonella , via stool sample. The breakfast at Trinity United Church of Christ was held March 5. The sausage and meat pudding were produced by a group of 4-H members in Frederick, Maryland.

It&apos;s not clear if any of the victims were hospitalized, but even if they weren&apos;t, Salmonella infection, or Salmonellosis , is not to be taken lightly. Even after initial symptoms of diarrhea and stomach pain subside, there is a risk of longer-term or chronic illnesses, including arterial infections, reactive arthritis or Reiter&apos;s syndrome .

Any legal questions about this outbreak can be directed to 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free), the food safety offices of PritzkerOlsen, P.A .One of our lawyers with expertise in Salmonella litigation will provide a free case consultation.

 Salmonella Outbreak From Laboratories 
 Posted on April 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A commercially available Salmonella Typhimurium strain used in laboratory settings has been linked to a Salmonella outbreak that has killed one person and sickened 72 others in 35 states. The lab Salmonella outbreak, announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), includes six cases in Pennsylvania, five each in Georgia and Washington, four in Minnesota and three in Wisconsin.

 CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states to investigate the outbreak associated with exposure to clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. The lab Salmonella outbreaks includes small numbers of cases in a large amount of states:: AK (1), AL (3), AZ (2), CA (1), GA (5), IA (1), ID (2), IL (3), IN (1), KS (1), KY (3), MA (2), MD (2), MI (2), MN (4), MO (2), NC (1), ND (1), NE (2), NJ (2), NM (3), NV (1), NY (1), OH (1), OK (1), OR (1), PA (6), SC (2), SD (1), TN (2), TX (1), UT (3), WA (5), WI (3), WY (1). The CDC says 14 percent of patients have been hospitalized.

The outbreak was active from February through March, but new cases have diminished. Illnesses have been identified among students in microbiology teaching laboratories and employees in clinical microbiology laboratories. The New Mexico Department of Health found that the outbreak strain was indistinguishable from a commercially available Salmonella Typhimurium strain used in laboratory settings. This commercially available strain was known to be present in several teaching or clinical laboratories associated with ill students or employees infected with the outbreak strain.

Victims of this outbreak who have legal questions should contact 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) for a free case consultation with food safety lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A.. Go here to contact the firm online , 

  If you work with Salmonella bacteria in a microbiology laboratory, the CDC advises that you watch for symptoms of Salmonella infection, such as diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Call your health care provider if you or a family member has any of these symptoms. The agency also has the following tips to avoid spreading dangerous bacteria used in labs: 

 Wash hands frequently while working in and immediately after leaving the lab -- especially before preparing food or baby bottles, before eating and before contact with young children. Do not bring food, drinks or personal items like car keys, cell phones and mp3 players into the laby. These items may become contaminated if you touch them while working or if you place them on work surfaces. Do not bring pens, notebooks, and other items used inside of the microbiology laboratory into your home. Wear a lab coat or other protective uniform over personal clothing. Leave it in the laboratory when you are finished. Dispose of protective clothing appropriately or deposit it for laundering by the institution.

 E. coli Beef Missing Food Poison Ranking 
 Posted on April 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella is paired with four of 10 foods in a ranking of the riskiest combinations of foods and illness-causing bacteria released this week by researchers at the University of Florida&apos;s Emerging Pathogens Institute. 

 It&apos;s interesting to say the least that the list excludes Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and ground beef -- a combination so lethal that the federal government for years has employed a vast testing program to prevent hamburger E. coli outbreak.  E. coli O157:H7, which doesn&apos;t make the institute&apos;s list, is the most linked pathogen to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), perhaps the most feared of a food poisoning outcomes. 

The pathogens institute at the University of Florida said the combinations it chose are responsible for nearly 3.9 million illnesses, about 30,000 hospitalizations and 765 deaths per year in the U.S., 
 Researchers say they hope the list will lead regulators to concentrate on potentially contaminated foods that pose the greatest threat to public health.   Here&apos;s the list: 
 Campylobacter/poultry, Toxoplasma/pork, Listeria/deli meats Salmonella/poultry. Listeria/dairy products. Salmonella/complex foods. Norovirus/complex foods. Salmonella/produce Toxoplasma/beef Salmonella/eggs.

 Cucumber Salmonella Recall by FDA 
 Posted on April 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw Cucumbers and Salmonella are an unusual pair, but a North Carolina produce company has recalled 1,590 bulk cartons of the vegetables in a development that merits a mention here. No illnesses have been linked to the potentially contaminated cukes, but the recall is something for people to be aware of in New York, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Nebraska, Texas and Wyoming. The recall by L&amp;M Companies Inc., which was published by the Food and Drug Administration, covers bulk cartons shipped between March 30 and April 7.  The recalled cartons are marked Nature&apos;s Delight and contain the Lot # PL-RID-002990 on the side of the carton . The nationwide recall Friday came after FDA inspectors in mid-April found Salmonella on a randomly selected sample of cucumbers in a cooler at Four Seasons Produce of Central Florida.     Salmonellosis  should not be taken lightly and people who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor. In some cases there are chronic consequences. Arthritic symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. One of the most severe and painful complications is reactive arthritis, or  Reiter&apos;s Syndrome .   In Salmonella outbreak situations where people have been sickened by food that is positively linked to illness, food poisoning litigation can help families and individuals recover money for harms that go beyond the medical bills they encounter. Free case consultations are provided in all Salmonella outbreaks by nationally prominent food safety lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by contact form .      Tags: Food Poisoning , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawyer , Salmonella Recall , cucumber

 DeFusco Bakery Salmonella Shutdown 
 Posted on April 18, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Rhode Island health officials have ordered the closing of DeFusco Bakery facilities in Johnston and Cranston while they continue to investigate a Salmonella outbreak that has killed two people and sickened 77 others. The state health department also ordered that all employees of DeFusco&apos;s submit to stool samples for Salmonella testing.

 The compliance order also states that DeFusco’s must get written permission from HEALTH before selling or discarding any bakery equipment and must provide any information related to the investigation that HEALTH requests.

The outbreak started at a nursing home in Warwick, Rhode Island, in early March after cream-filled zeppole from DeFusco&apos;s were served as a treat. Inspectors found food safety violations at the Johnston facility, including egg cartons used to store pastry shells.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is continuing to accept cases from this outbreak. Free consultations about a  DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit  can be started with an  online contact  to our law firm or by calling an attorney at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Update: DeFusco&apos;s RI Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on April 17, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Several Rhode Island food establishments have been routinely using cardboard egg boxes to store food -- a violation of Rhode Island&apos;s Food Safety regulations. The state&apos;s Office of Food Protection has issued a warning to all companies to cease this practice -- which is believed to have contributed to a major Salmonella outbreak related to zeppole and other baked goods from DeFusco&apos;s Bakery.

 &quot;This practice is cross contaminating food and can potentially lead to illness or death,&apos;&apos; said Ernest P. Julian, chief of the Office of Food Protection.&quot;Under no circumstances is this practice allowable.&apos;&apos;  

In the investigation of the DeFusco&apos;s Bakery Salmonella outbreak in Johnston, R.I., inspectors discovered pastry shells stored in egg crates that tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella .  Those shells may have been used in zeppoles distributed at DeFusco&apos;s and across Rhode Island.

 As of April 15, there were 78 outbreak cases, including 48 lab-confirmed  Salmonella infections. Twenty-nine people were hospitalized and two people have died.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is continuing to accept cases from this outbreak. Free consultations about a DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit can be started with an online contact to our law firm or by calling an attorney at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Turkey Burger Salmonella Outbreak Strain Proving Resistant to Multiple Antibiotics 
 Posted on April 14, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The turkey burger S almonella outbreak is providing the public health community with yet another example of an antimicrobial resistant pathogen spread in food. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Jennie-O outbreak strain of Salmonella Hadar is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

By April 1 a dozen people in 10 states were infected by Salmonella associated with Jennie-O turkey burgers sold at Sam&apos;s Club stores nationwide, including three people in Wisconsin. Salmonella lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are continuing to investigate and accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or via the law firm&apos;s turkey Salmonella lawsuit contact page.  

 Foodborne illnesses due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been occurring since the 1970s. A recent study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) shows a steady increase of such outbreaks in every decade since the 1970s, though that may also be due to increased testing and reporting. In its study of 35 documented outbreaks, raw milk, raw milk cheeses and ground beef appeared to carry the resistant pathogens most frequently.

 A widely held view is that overuse of antibiotics on farm animals has squandered their effectiveness and leave consumers vulnerable to hard-to-treat foodborne infections. 

In the CSPI analysis, multi-drug resistance was found in 10 out of 14 outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant foodborne illness reported between 2000 and 2009. Like CSPI, PritzkerOlsen founder and president Fred Pritzker says the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria needs much greater scrutiny by federal government if antibiotics are to remain effective in treating human and veterinary illnesses. Pritzker, one of the nation&apos;s leading practitioners of foodborne illness litigation, is actively involved in efforts to prevent outbreaks and has collected millions of dollars for victims of Salmonella,  including numerous Salmonella death tragedies

 Second Salmonella Death in Rhode Island 
 Posted on April 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The DeFusco&apos;s outbreak in Rhode Island has led to a second Salmonella death. Lawyer Fred Pritzker is investigating the tragic outbreak and is accepting cases for a DeFusco&apos;s Bakery lawsuit. He has already called on DeFusco&apos;s to immediately pay the out-of-pocket expenses of the more than 65 victims and their families until the totality of claims can be settled or worked out in litigation.

 Salmonella infection , or salmonellosis,  should not be taken lightly and people who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor. In some cases there are chronic consequences. Arthritic symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. One of the most severe and painful complications is reactive arthritis, or  Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.  For the sake of victims, long-term consequences of these poisonings must be considered when holding the bakery accountable.

 Most recent information from the Rhode Island Department of Health is that 66 people have been sickened, including 28 who were hospitalized. The first person to die with Salmonella during the outbreak was a man in his 80s from Providence County. The second Salmonella death happened to a man in his 90s, also from Providence County. While many people sickened in the outbreak are residents of nursing homes, these two men weren&apos;t, according to the Providence Journal newspaper.

DeFusco&apos;s Bakery in Johnston closed down, and its products were recalled, on March 25 after a Health Department inspection found many food-safety violations. Investigators have linked the outbreak to cream-filled zeppoles. The violations included storing empty, baked pastry shells in cardboard boxes that formerly held trays of raw eggs. Tests later found evidence of Salmonella in the boxes.

To contact Fred for a free case consultation, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our Salmonella lawyer contact form.  National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is one of the very few legal groups in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning over the years.

 Rhode Island Salmonella Outbreak Continuation of More Illness Reported 
 Posted on April 7, 2011 by PritzkerLaw Rhode Island Salmonella cases from DeFusco&apos;s Bakery continue to be reported by the Rhode Island Department of Health in an outbreak that started March 14 and has been linked to cream-filled zeppole pastries -- including nursing home zeppole deliveries. Tragically, two Salmonella deaths and 70 illnesses are prescribed to this outbreak by health officials.   Information about a DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit can be obtained from PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food safety law firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our Rhode Island Salmonella lawsuit contact form . Our attorney, David Szerlag, is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association, and our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. We hold food companies and their insurance companies accountable for poisonings and diseases spread by bacteria that has no business being in the food we eat.   RI HEALTH Update on DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak:   
 As of early April 11, there have been 70 total cases of illness, including one from Massachusetts. 29 of those case patients have been hospitalized -- a high rate attributed in part to servings sold at nursing homes in Warwick and different parts of the state. Of those hospitalized, 25 have been discharged and four remained hospitalized April 11. The outbreak includes 42 lab-confirmed Salmonella infections of the same DNA-matched serotype. There have been two Salmonella -associated deaths HEALTH&apos;s investigation continues. 
 If you or a loved one has developed symptoms of Salmonella , immediately see your physician. Many healthy adults withstand illness without seeking medical care, but some infections become severe and can cause long-term arthritic illness or, in rare cases, Salmonella death. A man from Providence County who was in his 80s died during this outbreak with Salmonella in his system.   Rhode Island Inspectors found pastry shells stored in egg crates at the DeFusco&apos;s production facility that tested positive for Salmonella and cream kept at unhealthy temperatures.  Tags: DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit , DeFusco&apos;s salmonella , DeFuscos Bakery salmonella , DeFuscos bakery lawsuit , Defusco&apos;s settlement , Rhode Island Food Poisoning Lawyers , Rhode Island Salmonella Lawyers , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawsuit , rhode island , zeppole salmonella

 Jennie-O Turkey Salmonella Outbreak Strain Proving Resistant to Antibiotics 
 Posted on April 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The strain of Salmonella that has sickened 12 people in 10 states is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or treatment failure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced. States have reported antibiotic resistance of the outbreak strain of Salmonella Hadar to several clinically useful drugs including ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalothin, and tetracycline

The CDC is helping states and USDA investigate the Jennie-O  Salmonella outbreak, which has been associated with certain Jennie-O turkey patties sold at Sam&apos;s Club stores nationwide. The frozen boxes of 12 patties with a use-by date of DEC. 23, 2011, have been recalled by Jennie-O, a Minnesota-based subsidiary of Hormel Foods Corporation. Click here for Jennie-O recall information. 
 At least three of the case-patients in Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin specifically reported eating Jennie-O Turkey burgers the week before their illness began. Samples of Jennie-O ground turkey burgers were collected by public health agencies from the homes of case-patients in Colorado and Wisconsin. Both turkey burger samples were positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella.   As of April 1, 2011, 12 victims have been reported from 10 states: Arizona (1 case), California (1 case), Colorado (1 case), Georgia (1 case), Illinois (1 case), Missouri (1 case), Mississippi (1 case), Ohio (1 case), Washington (1 case), and Wisconsin (3 cases). Illnesses began occurring in December and have continued through March 24. Among the 12 ill persons with available information, three have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.   Victims of this outbreak may be interested in details of a possible turkey Salmonella lawsuit . Food safety attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are providing free case consultations at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or a lawyer will respond to your onlline contact form.   Our firm is one of the very few in the nation practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for victims of food poisoning.

 Salmonella Lawyer Calling on Jennie-O Turkey Store to Pay Outbreak Expenses 
 Posted on April 5, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The following press release went out from our office today in response to the multi-state Salmonella outbreak associated with certain Jennie-O turkey patties: 

Nationally recognized food safety attorney Fred Pritzker is calling on Jennie-O Turkey Store, Inc. to immediately pay medical expenses and out-of-pocket losses for all victims of the current Salmonella Hadar outbreak that has sickened consumers in at least 10 states.

 The recalled Jennie-O Turkey Store burgers, distributed exclusively at Sam’s Club stores nationwide, have been linked by federal health officials to at least 12 illnesses dating back to December and as recently as mid-March. Because the recalled Jennie-O turkey burgers have a use-by date of December 23, 2011, it is conceivable that many others will be exposed to the risk from products in their home freezers. Jennie-O Turkey Store, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hormel Foods Corporation.

“Jennie-O has the resources to pay all medical bills, lost wages and other immediate expenses for the victims of this outbreak,’’Pritzker said.“Relieving these families of unforeseen financial burdens is the right thing to do as they focus on recovering from illness and hospitalization.’’ 
 Pritzker said a Jennie-O lawsuit likely will be necessary to address the totality of claims -- including compensation for pain and suffering, arthritic conditions such as Reiter’s Syndrome and other chronic ills that can be caused by Salmonella infection (salmonellosis). To date, victims reside in Wisconsin, Colorado, Ohio, California, Arizona, Missouri, Mississippi, Washington, Georgia and Illinois.   Headquartered in Minnesota, PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has collected tens of millions of dollars on behalf of victims sickened in outbreaks of Salmonella, E. coli and other types of foodborne illness. Mr. Pritzker and his firm represent outbreak victims throughout the United States. He frequently is quoted in national news stories on issues related to food contamination, and he is actively involved in multiple efforts to prevent the spread of dangerous pathogens in the nation’s food supply.   To contact Fred and his associates about the Jennie-O recall and Jennie-O Salmonella outbreak , call 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or visit the firm’s contact page  Tags: Jennie-O Recall , Jenny-O Salmonella , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawsuit , turkey burger salmonella

 Sam&apos;s Club Sold Jennie-O Turkey Patties Recalled in Salmonella Hadar Outbreak 
 Posted on April 4, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Sam&apos;s Club stores nationwide sold Jennie-O turkey patties associated with a Salmonella outbreak in Wisconsin, Colorado, Ohio, California and six other states. One dozen people have been infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Hadar since December. The most recent onset of illness reported by authorities came in mid-March. 

 The USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today what Jennie-O previously reported: That 55,000 pounds of recalled Jennie-O turkey patties recalled because of possible Salmonella contamination were sold nationwide, exclusively at Sam&apos;s Club stores. The 4-pound boxes of Jennie-O Turkey Store&quot;All Natural Turkey Burgers with seasonings Lean White Meat&quot;contain a dozen individually wrapped patties of uncooked ground turkey. The boxes have a sell-by date of December 23, 2011.

FSIS is continuing to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), affected state public health partners, and the company on the investigation. FSIS says it will provide information about any related recall activity. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a physician. Those people who fall ill may want information about a Jennie-O lawsuit . National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is providing free case consultations at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or online via our Jennie-O contact form.

 Salmonella attorneys at PrizkerOlsen represent victims nationwide and have collected tens of millions of dollars for people who suffer illness in outbreaks of food poisoning.

 Jenny-O Salmonella: Attorneys Call on Jenny-O to Pay Medical Expenses to Victims in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Washington, and Wisconsin 
 Posted on April 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Jenny-O Salmonella Victims Deserve Compensation 

 Twelve people and their families have spent money on medical care and lost wages and other income due to Salmonella Hadar infections associated with eating Jenny-O turkey burgers. The 12 Salmonella victims also suffered severe pain. People were sickened in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Washington, and Wisconsin. Jenny-O has recalled the turkey burgers , but more needs to be done.

Lawsuits arising from this Jenny-O Salmonella outbreak will seek compensation for the victims, but as Salmonella attorneys we know that it may take some time before the cases are settled or resolved in a trial.

The responsible thing for Jenny-O to do is immediately compensate the victims for all medical expenses related to the Jenny-O Salmonella infections and complications from those infections. The victims and their families should not have to carry this financial burden.

 Salmonella food poisoning results in violent illness, often leading to a visit to the emergency room. In most outbreaks, some victims require hospitalization. Our experience is that in larger Salmonella outbreaks, at least one person develops Reiter&apos;s syndrome and at least one person dies . The financial burden for a family can be staggering.

Our team of Salmonella lawyers is investigating this outbreak, and anyone with questions about a lawsuit against Jenny-O Turkey Store, a Minnesota company, can contact us for a free consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or submit our free consultation form . An attorney will get back to you as soon as possible, usually within a few hours.

 The Salmonella lawyers at Pritzker Olsen law firm have won millions for food poisoning victims nationwide and have appeared on national and local news programs to discuss food poisoning lawsuits and food safety. We have won food poisoning cases in Wisconsin, California, Colorado, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.

 Zeppole Salmonella Update in R.I. 
 Posted on April 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The DeFusco&apos;s Zeppole and mini- Zeppole Salmonella outbreak in Rhode Island has sickened at least 56 people, including 26 who were hospitalized for intervention. Those are the latest numbers from the State of Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH).

A man in his 80s from Providence County died during this outbreak while infected with Salmonella . The investigation is continuing in search of product sample test results and other factors. Cream-filled Zeppole and mini-Zeppole made by DeFusco&apos;s Bakery have been associated with the outbreak that started in a Warwick nursing home that served DeFusco&apos;s Zeppole as a treat. Eleven of the residents fell ill and seven were hospitalized.

 Victims and their families may contact food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker and his associate David Szerlag, who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association. The firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is investigating the outbreak and accepting cases from patients and their loved ones. Contact Fred or David at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing a Zeppole Salmonella contact form .

 Samonellosis caused by contaminated baked goods can lead to chronic health problems, including arthritic conditions, reactive arthritis and Reiter&apos;s Syndrome -- all of which should be the responsibility of the wrongdoer.  Salmonella  symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal, diarrhea, fever, and headache. These acute symptoms may last for 1 or 2 days or may be prolonged depending on virulence factors.  Salmonella  is especially dangerous for infants, the elderly, and people with HIV or in treatment for cancer.   Salmonellosis   should not be taken lightly and people who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor

 JennieO Turkey Burger Salmonella 
 Posted on April 2, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Jennie-O turkey burger Salmonella outbreak is under investigation by the USDA and health officials in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Washington. One dozen case patients have been diagnosed with infections of Salmonella Hadar. 

Jennie-O said the products were distributed exclusively at Sam&apos;s Club stores nationwide.

 National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has launched its own independent investigation of this outbreak and is accepting cases from families and individuals affected by the outbreak. If you or a loved one has fallen sick after eating a frozen turkey burger from Jennie-O, see your doctor immediately. For questions about a turkey burger lawsuit to hold the company accountable for the harms associated with this outbreak, call Pritzker at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our online contact form and an attorney will call you for a free consultation.  

Wisconsin officials reported the first case of Salmonella Hadar and the investigation expanded to the other states with illnesses occurring between December 2010 and March 2011. USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) determined that three of the patients in Colorado, Ohio and Wisconsin specifically reported eating this product prior to illness onset and hospitalization. The most recent report came March 14.
 
&quot;As a result of the epidemiologic investigation, FSIS determined that there is a link between the Jennie-O ground turkey products and this illness outbreak,&apos;&apos; FSIS said in a news release announcing the turkey burger Salmonella outbreak.

 MD Salmonella Outbreak Breakfast Event 
 Posted on April 1, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
In Thurmont, Maryland, Salmonella associated with a pancake and sausage breakfast is being investigated by the Frederick County Health Department, ABC station affiliate Channel 2 reported.

 The Salmonella outbreak in March was connected by health investigators to a benefit breakfast that featured sausage made at a Frederick County 4-H Country Butchering event in late January. The State Health Department Lab tested some of the meat bought by guests and found Salmonella bacteria. Channel 2 did not say how many people were sickened in the outbreak and there was no press release available from the county health department&apos;s website.

 Salmonella symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal, diarrhea, fever, and headache. These acute symptoms may last for 1 or 2 days or may be prolonged depending on virulence factors.  Salmonella is especially dangerous for infants, the elderly, and people with HIV or in treatment for cancer. Salmonellosis should not be taken lightly and people who suspect they have it should immediately see a doctor. In some cases there are chronic consequences. Arthritic symptoms may follow 3-4 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. One of the most severe and painful complications is reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. 
 Anyone with questions about the outbreak can call food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our contact form and an attorney will call you. Tags: Maryland Salmonella , Reiter , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawyer , Salmonella outbreak

 43 Sick with Salmonella in RI, 1 Dead 
 Posted on March 31, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Rhode Island Samonella Outbreak investigators are probing 43 illnesses, 22 hospitalizations and one death as part of their work to untangle one of the worst foodborne illness events known in the state. The person who died was a man in his 80s from Providence County and health officials are determining if he ate any cream-filled pastries or other baked goods from DeFusco&apos;s Bakery.

 The Rhode Island Department of Health has tied the outbreak (one case patient is from Massachusetts) to cream-filled zeppole and possibly other baked goods made by DeFusco&apos;s in Johnston, where inspectors found food safety violations. The production facility was voluntarily closed by the owner pending the investigation. Health officials were first notified of trouble when 11 residents of a nursing home in Warwick fell ill Friday, including seven who went to the hospital. DeFusco&apos;s zeppole had been brought into the nursing home as a treat.

The high hospitalization rate -- nearly half of those who fall ill are admitted -- is related to a sizable number of catering events at nursing homes and care facilities in Warwick, West Warwick, Coventry and Riverside, RI. Young children and the elderly are the two groups who are most susceptible to severe illness from Salmonellosis, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , because their immune systems can be weakened or underdeveloped.

 Nationally recognized food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker has called on DeFusco&apos;s to immediately pay medical expenses, lost wages, travel costs, related daycare bills and other expense incurred by families to deal with these bacterial infections -- many of which could have long-term health implications.  Taking accountability for the contamination would at least bring some peace of mind to the families until a Rhode Island Salmonella zeppole lawsuit can be filed.

To contact Mr. Pritzker and fellow attorney David Szerlag, who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our firm&apos;s contact form . PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is actively involved in efforts to prevent outbreaks of food poisoning in the United States, while also holding wrongdoers accountable.

 OR, WA, CA Report Multiple Illnesses Framing Cantaloupe Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The latest Salmonella cantaloupe outbreak update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates the addition of just one more case patient, with March 4 marking the most recent onset of Salmonellosis. 

The outbreak strain of   Salmonella Panama has been confirmed in 13 people -- five from Oregon, four from Washington, two from California, one from Colorado and one from Maryland. In Idaho, there was a report that more than 40 guests became ill after consuming the cantaloupe at a wedding reception.  The Idaho cases have not yet been formally linked to the outbreak, but law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is investigating on behalf of victims and an attorney at the firm can be reached online or at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). 

Twelve of the13 confirmed victims of this outbreak reported eating cantaloupe in the week before illness. Eleven of these 12 ill persons ate cantaloupes purchased at eight different locations of a national warehouse club. Using traceback information, investigators found that the cantaloupes were source for Del Monte at a single farm in Guatemala.

 RI Salmonella Death DeFusco&apos;s Outbreak 
 Posted on March 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The first Salmonella death has been recorded in the DeFusco&apos;s zeppole outbreak in Rhode Island, a state health department spokeswoman said. The wrongful death victim was in his 80s and died March 23. He tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella , HEALTH spokeswoman Annemarie Beardsworth told CranstonPatch.

In all, at least 39 people have been sickened and 24 hospitalized, including nursing home residents in Warwick and other cities where DeFusco&apos;s zeppoles were catered. Eleven of the outbreak victims fell ill Friday at West Shore Health Center in Warwick and seven of those residents were hospitalized. 

 Based on findings reported from the Rhode Island food safety inspections of DeFusco&apos;s Bakery production facility in Johnston, this outbreak may have been caused by negligence -- especially considering that cream filling was found stored at ridiculously high temperatures and because pastry shells were stored in egg crates that easily could have been contaminated with Salmonella. 

Officials have not released the name of the person whose Salmonella death makes this outbreak the most tragic foodborne illness event of 2011. It is a truly horrible set of circumstances when you consider that this loss of human life and corresponding emotional distress in the man&apos;s family could have been prevented.

The same was true in 2009 during the peanut butter Salmonella outbreak that killed nine people. Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., was the first to file a Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit in that outbreak and handled more death cases from that outbreak than any other law firm. As one of the very few attorney groups anywhere that represents food poisoning victims all over the country, our firm is once again accepting cases from individuals and families whose loved one have been sickened or killed. Free consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing our online contact form.

 West Shore Health Center in Warwick, Rhode Island, Hit Hard by DeFusco&apos;s Zeppoles Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The elderly are so vulnerable to Salmonella poisoning. For those sickened at West Shore Health Center by DeFusco’s zeppoles contaminated with Salmonella , the cases of Salmonella poisoning were even worse because these victims had health problems that further weakened their immune systems. Sadly, one of the few real pleasures these people still have, eating special sweet treats, almost killed some of them.

The elderly residents of West Shore Health Center in Warwick, Rhode Island, should be compensated for their medical bills, pain and suffering, emotional distress and other damages. In addition, the compensation needs to take into account how the Salmonella poisoning from the zeppoles has permanently altered their health, impeded their rehabilitation and generally lessened their quality of life.

So many of us at our law firm can relate to the families of these dearly loved elderly people. Having a sick family member is hard enough, and it is tragic that this hardship was made exponentially more difficult by the apparent negligence of DeFusco’s Bakery. It is hard to imagine that anyone in the food industry would store pastries in cardboard boxes that had held raw eggs. Most of our children know better than that, especially after the huge Salmonella outbreak that sickened about 2000 people nationwide (that is the CDC number, but the actual number is far higher).

Our law firm is one of a handful that represent Salmonella outbreak victims nationwide, and perhaps the only major Salmonella litigation law firm with an attorney, David Szerlag, who is licensed to practice in Rhode Island.

Attorney David Szerlag is part of our Salmonella litigation team at Pritzker Olsen law firm. He recently was one of the lead attorneys in multidistrict litigation (MDL) that resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement for people injured by a defective product. MDL is like a class action lawsuit. David was one of three attorneys who oversaw the pretrial procedures for dozens of attorneys throughout the United States.

 DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak in R.I. Sickened 11 at Warwick Nursing Home 
 Posted on March 29, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The DeFusco Salmonella outbreak in Rhode Island first caught the attention of public health officials when 11 residents of the West Shore Health Center, a Warwick nursing home, fell ill, according to a report in the Providence Journal newspaper. Seven of the West Shore residents were so infected with Salmonella they needed hospitalization. 

 In all, 33 people are being counted by the Rhode Island Department of Health as confirmed or suspected victims of the outbreak. Seventeen of those were hospitalized, a HEALTH spokeswoman told the Journal. The high rate of hospitalization in this outbreak is being attributed to the inclusion of large numbers of older adults whose weakened immune systems make them more susceptible to complications.
 At Warwick&apos;s West Shore Health Center, interviews revealed that all of those who were sickened had eaten cream-filled DeFusco&apos;s zeppoles that were brought in as a special treat.  Health inspectors went to the DeFusco&apos;s Johnston outlet, which is both a store and a production facility. The business voluntarily shut down and all of DeFusco’s products were recalled. At the facility, inspectors found two fundamental food safety hazards and other problems. The Journal put it this way based on an interview with HEALTH spokeswoman Annmarie Beardsworth:  &quot;The custard filling is supposed to be cooled to 70 degrees within two hours and to 40 degrees within four hours of preparation, to prevent the growth of bacteria. But on Friday, six hours after the filling was made, five-gallon buckets left to cool on the floor were measured at 125 degrees and 119 degrees. Additionally, inspectors found that pastry shells for both the zeppole and theéclairs had been stored in crates that previously held raw eggs. If an infected egg had cracked in the box, residue containing salmonella could have come in contact with the shells.&apos;&apos;   Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., and its attorney David Szerlag, who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association, are accepting cases from victims of this outbreak -- one of the biggest foodborne illness outbreaks in Rhode Island in recent years. David can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or submit a form online and he or another lawyer from our firm will contact you.   A DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella lawsuit could help families recover from medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages and other harms by holding the responsible parties accountable for a dangerous outbreak of food poisoning. Pritzker Olsen is one of the very few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness and has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of Salmonella and other human pathogens in food.

 Rhode Island Nursing Homes Among Locations DeFusco&apos;s Sold Pastries 
 Posted on March 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 A large number of elderly case patients has pushed up the hospitalization rate in the Rhode Island DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella outbreak , a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Health said. Of 33 people sickend in the zeppole Salmonella outbreak, 17 have been hospitalized, spokeswoman Annmarie Beardsworth told the Providence Journal.

   West Warwick Manor Senior Center, Crescent Park Manor in Riverside and Sparrow Point Senior Center in West Warwick are three of the places where recalled DeFusco&apos;s Bakery zeppoles and other goods were sold prior to the outbreak.

Beardsworth told the newspaper that HEALTH investigators are testing the cream filling and zeppole pastry shells in search of the outbreak strain of Salmonella . DeFusco&apos;s voluntarily shut down its Johnston, Rhode Island, production facility after inspectors found improper refrigeration of cream filling and that pastry shells were stored in boxes that previously contained raw eggs.  Salmonella  can be associated with almost every type of food known, but is most often found in animals and animal products, including chickens and eggs.

Especially in young children and older adults, Salmonellosis    is not to be taken lightly. In these patients and others who have weakened or underdeveloped immune systems, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause Salmonella death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

 DeFusco&apos;s Bakery Zeppole Salmonella Lawsuit for Compensation of Victims in Rhode Island 
 Posted on March 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
At least 25 people have been sickened after eating zeppoles from DeFusco’s Bakery in Rhode Island. So far, 13 of the 25 have tested positive for Salmonella, and 10 people have been hospitalized. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) :
 
The most likely cause of illness is consumption of zeppole pastries that came in contact with raw eggs. Pastry shells from DeFusco&apos;s had been stored in used egg crates, which could have exposed the shells to infected raw eggs.
 
We are a national Salmonella litigation law firm, and David Szerlag, one of our attorneys, is licensed to practice in Rhode Island. Victims of this Salmonella food poisoning outbreak deserve compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, emotional distress and other damages. Contact our Salmonella lawyers for a free consultation regarding a DeFuco’s Bakery zeppole Salmonella lawsuit. Salmonella can cause death and serious illness, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , a reactive arthritis.

This is particularly true given that the Rhode Island Department of Health found evidence that DeFusco’s Bakery negligently stored the zeppole shells in used egg crates. This is after a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella linked to eggs that sickened hundreds of people.

The bad news keeps getting worse:
 
HEALTH has now learned that American Bakery Supplies, a distributor in West Warwick, purchased zeppoles from DeFusco&apos;s. The company then distributed the pastries to Roch&apos;s Market in West Warwick; Meal Works in Coventry; and Touch of Class Catering in West Warwick. Meal Works (a catering company) served these zeppoles at events on March and 18 at West Warwick Manor Senior Center, St John and Paul Church in Coventry, Sparrow Point (senior facility) in West Warwick, and Crescent Park Manor in Riverside.
 
Zeppoles from DeFusco’s Johnston store were also sold at all DeFusco’s locations; Colvitto’s Bistro in Narragansett (note, yesterday&apos;s press release incorrectly listed the bakery&apos;s name as Calvitto&apos;s in Narragansett); Sal’s Bakery in Providence; and Focaccia World in Johnston. All five Crugnale Bakery locations in Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston, and Cumberland also sold DeFusco’s zeppoles from March 16 through March 20.
 
During this investigation HEALTH also discovered unsafe food storage practices at Buono&apos;s Bakery in Providence. Their zeppole, cream puff, andéclair shells were also stored in used egg crates, which could lead to contamination from raw eggs. People are advised to immediately discard all baked goods from any DeFusco&apos;s ; zeppoles from any of the above locations; and zeppoles, cream puffs, andéclairs from Buono&apos;s Bakery in Providence.

 10 Hospitalized in RI Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 28, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Rhode Island Salmonella outbreak investigators found DeFusco&apos;s Bakery storing pastry shells in used egg crates, which the RI Department of Health said could have exposed the shells to bacteria from contaminated raw eggs. As the investigation continues, HEALTH officials have now received reports of 25 people who are ill, inlcuding 10 who have been hospitalized. Many consumed cream-filled zeppoles from DeFusco&apos;s.

 &quot;The most likely cause of illness is consumption of zeppole pastries that came in contact with raw eggs,&apos;&apos; HEALTH said in a press release. 

 The department is looking into the source of the eggs and its investigators have worked through the weekend testing food samples in order to pinpoint the cause of the outbreak, which has affected many parts of the state. 

Attorney David Szerlag is available for a free consultation regarding a DeFusco Bakery Salmonella lawsuit in Rhode Island. He is part of the Salmonella litigation team at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., and is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association. He can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or via the firm&apos;s Salmonella contact page. 

State investigators have learned that American Bakery Supplies, a distributor in West Warwick, purchased zeppoles from DeFusco&apos;s. The company then distributed the pastries to Roch&apos;s Market in West Warwick; Meal Works in Coventry; and Touch of Class Catering in West Warwick. Meal Works (a catering company) served these zeppoles at events at West Warwick Manor Senior Center, St John and Paul Church in Coventry, Sparrow Point (senior facility) in West Warwick, and Crescent Park Manor in Riverside. Any person of any age can suffer severe illness from Salmonella  infection , but the elderly, young children and other people who have weakened or underdeveloped immune systems are most susceptible.

HEALTH published the following updated list of other locations that sold the cream pastries from DeFusco&apos;s production facility in Johnston. All DeFusco’s locations; Colvitto’s Bistro in Narragansett (note, yesterday&apos;s press release incorrectly listed the bakery&apos;s name as Calvitto&apos;s in Narragansett); Sal’s Bakery in Providence; and Focaccia World in Johnston. All five Crugnale Bakery locations in Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston, and Cumberland also sold DeFusco’s zeppoles from March 16 through March 20. 
 During this investigation, HEALTH discovered food safety issues at the Johnston kitchen and it also discovered unsafe food storage practices at Buono&apos;s Bakery in Providence, the agency said in its press release. Their zeppole, cream puff, andéclair shells were also stored in used egg crates, which could lead to contamination from raw eggs.  Tags: DeFusco , DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit , DeFusco&apos;s salmonella , Defusco&apos;s settlement , Rhode Island Food Poisoning Lawyers , Rhode Island Salmonella Lawyers , Salmonella , Salmonella Attorney , Salmonella Lawsuit , rhode island , zeppole salmonella , zeppoles

 Cantaloupe Salmonella Prevention Tips 
 Posted on March 27, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 

Food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is nationally recognized for its experience in Salmonella litigation and other foodborne illness lawsuits. We represent victims to help them recover financially from the multiple harms of food poisoning. To contact the firm&apos;s claims center, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our  contact form .

 Given the historical association of cantaloupe with outbreaks of  Salmonella and E. coli,   the Food and Drug Administration in the past has issued the following consumer guidelines to reduce the risk of food poisoning from cantaloupes. Pritzker Olsen  Salmonella lawyers have reproduced the guidelines below: 

 Purchase cantaloupes that are not bruised or damaged. If buying fresh-cut cantaloupe, be sure it is refrigerated or surrounded by ice. After purchase, refrigerate cantaloupes promptly. Wash hands with hot, soapy water before and after handling fresh cantaloupes. Scrub whole cantaloupes by using a clean produce brush and cool tap water immediately before eating. Don&apos;t use soap or detergents. Use clean cutting surfaces and utensils when cutting cantaloupes. Wash cutting boards, countertops, dishes, and utensils with hot water and soap between the preparation of raw meat, poultry, or seafood and the preparation of cantaloupe. If there happens to be a bruised or damaged area on a cantaloupe, cut away those parts before eating it. Leftover cut cantaloupe should be discarded if left at room temperature for more than two hours. Use a cooler with ice or use ice gel packs when transporting or storing cantaloupes outdoors.

 R.I. Cream Pastry Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 27, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A cream pastry Salmonella outbreak in Rhode Island has focused attention on bakery conditions at DeFusco&apos;s Bakery -- maker of zeppoles that have been associated with 19 people who became sick. Thirteen of these pastry outbreak victims were hospitalized.

Rhode Island health investigators announced a recall of all baked goods sold at DeFusco’s Bakeries following an inspection of the Johnston, Rhode Island, kitchen where the pastries were made. Inspectors found pastry cream for use in zeppoles andéclairs was stored at unsafe temperatures. In addition, the DeFusco&apos;s store contained unsafe, unsanitary conditions for food . The owner of DeFusco’s in Johnston has voluntarily closed the bakery until further notice. 

Rhode Islanders who ate DeFusco&apos;s cream pastries and have Salmonella symptoms should quickly see a doctor. While not all Salmonella infections will require medical care, anyone who has been sickened should be aware of long-term effects for this type of food poisoning and the medical liabilities and other harms that go along with it.

A possible DeFusco&apos;s lawsuit is pending and law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is accepting cases from victims via our contact page or 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE). Our nationally recognized foodborne illness lawyers also have launched an independent investigation of this zeppoles cream pastry Salmonella outbreak to determine more about the cause of contamination.

 DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak in R.I. 
 Posted on March 26, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Update (March 28, 2011): There are now 33 reports of illness associated with this DeFusco&apos;s zeppoles Salmonella outbreak. Seventeen people have been hospitalized, seven of them from West Shore Health Center in Warwick, Rhode Island.
 

A Rhode Island Salmonella outbreak is under investigation by state health officials who say the outbreak possibly may be related to cream pastries called zeppoles from DeFusco&apos;s Bakery. Nine of the 19 suspected outbreak victims have tested positive for Salmonella and 13 have been hospitalized. DeFusco&apos;s Bakery initiated a recall and its production facility in Johnston has been shut down after an inspection discovered food safety problems.

&quot;Staff found pastry cream that is used in zeppoles andéclairs was stored at unsafe temperatures as well as unsanitary conditions in the store,&apos;&apos; the Rhode Island Department of Health said in a press release Saturday.

 Nationally recognized food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is conducting its own investigation of this outbreak and is accepting cases from individuals and families who seek representation in a DeFusco&apos;s Salmonella lawsuit. An attorney can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or victims of the outbreak can contact us online .

Various Rhode Island agencies are continuing to investigate the source of the outbreak and are working to identify additional retail outlets where DeFusco’s sells cream pastries. So far, the Health Department has learned that zeppoles from DeFusco’s Johnston store are sold at all DeFusco’s locations; Calvitto’s in Narragansett; Sal’s Bakery in Providence; Focaccia World in Johnston; and American Bakery Supplies, a distributor in West Warwick. All five Crugnale Bakery locations in Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston, and Cumberland also sold DeFusco’s zeppoles from March 16 through March 20 .
 Salmonella symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps and fever and usually last four to seven days. People with symptoms should quickly seek a doctor. Many healthy adults survive Salmonellosis without medical care, but some illnesses can be severe and in rare case, death occurs. There are several long-term risks associated with Salmonella poisoning, including reactive arthritis or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.  People of any age can become severely ill from Salmonella , but young children, the elderly and others who have compromised immune systems are most likely to have serious complications.   Pritzker Olsen is one of the very few law firms in the nation practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. Over the years we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of Salmonella and other types of food poisoning. Our firm also is actively involved in efforts to prevent foodborne illness and has been called on by national news networks to explain the dangers of contaminated food and surrounding issues.

 Salmonella Outbreak Traced to Cantaloupe 
 Posted on March 26, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella on cantaloupe traced to a single farm in Guatemala  may have caused an outbreak of Salmonella Panama that has sickened a dozen people in Oregon (5 cases), Washington (4 cases), California (2 cases), and Maryland (1 case). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is continuing to investigate in conjunction with FDA and various state health departments. Two of the victims of this food poisoning outbreak were hospitalized.

The cantaloupes were distributed through warehouse clubs in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.
 In the outbreak investigation, 11 of 12 ill persons reported eating cantaloupe in the week before illness. Ten of these 11 ill persons ate cantaloupes purchased at seven different locations of a national warehouse club. Information gathered with patient permission from membership card records helped determine that ill persons purchased cantaloupes sourced from a single farm in Guatemala.   Salmonella infections, or Salmonellosis, should not be taken lightly. If you or a loved one has symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, seek the care of your physician. There could be long-lasting effects, including reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. For representation by a food poisoning lawyer, contact nationally recognized PritzkerOlsen, P.A., at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our firm&apos;s contact form and a lawyer will call you.

 Microbiological Evidence May Prove Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 25, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Newlyweds Taylor and Kyle Walker are doing their own investigation into a possible Salmonella outbreak involving their wedding guests. According to an interview of the couple on KTVB , the Boise, Idaho wedding reception included cascading fruit displays that contained cantaloupe purchased at Costco. In the days following the wedding, Costco called the wedding caterer and warned her that she had purchased a large quantity of cantaloupe that may have been contaminated with Salmonella Panama.

Taylor and Kyle Walker think that was the case and have done their own epidemiological study to help prove it, texting and calling guests to find out what they ate at the wedding. For legal claims, it is important to have microbiological evidence that supports the epidemiological evidence. Microbiological evidence includes a diagnosis of Salmonella Panama. Anyone still suffering from the symptoms of Salmonella who has not been specifically diagnosed should see a medical professional immediately. PFGE analysis should then be done . Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is the DNA&quot;fingerprinting&quot;method that scientists use to determine the source of bacterial foodborne outbreaks.

 Serrano Peppers Recalled for Salmonella 
 Posted on March 19, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella threat in serrano peppers sold at Walmart in Wisconsin, Montana, Utah and Wyoming has prompted a recall by distributor WorldVariety Produce Inc. of Los Angeles. Some recalled serrano peppers also were distributed to Jewel-Osco stores in Illinois.

 To date, no illnesses have been associated with the recalled product. In 2008, jalapeno and serrano peppers were implicated as the source of a major, multistate outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul that sickened 1,442 people, including 286 persons who were hospitalized and the infection might have contributed to two deaths. Contamination of peppers in the 2008 Salmonella outbreak might have occurred on the farm or during processing or distribution; the mechanism of contamination was never fully determined.

 Salmonella causes fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In some circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and reactive arthritis known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome . In some extreme cases, infection results in  Salmonella death. 
 The affected Serrano Peppers in the current recall were grown in Mexico and isolated to 300 cases from Lot # 69073901. At the retail level, they were sold from bulk displays between the dates of March 1, 2011 through March 18, 2011. Contamination in the product was detected as part of a sampling program by the USDA which revealed that the finished products contained the bacteria. The FDA and California Department of Public Health continue their investigation as to what caused the Salmonella contamination.

 Ohio Egg Co. Shipped Contaminated Eggs 
 Posted on March 1, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The FDA found that an Ohio egg processor shipped 798 cases of eggs to market three days after the company&apos;s own tests showed Salmonella Enteritidis contamination, according to an FDA warning letter written to the firm&apos;s CEO last week.

 The food safety hazard was created in October 2010 by Ohio Fresh Eggs LLC of Johnstown, Ohio. The company initiated a recall on November 5 after the Salmonella -positive egg tests were uncovered by the FDA during a review of company records. The records review was ordered after 13 FDA environmental samples from four egg layer sites at the company were confirmed positive for Salmonella Enteritidis.

&quot;We found that you have serious deviations&apos;&apos; from federal regulations established to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis in shell egg production and storage, said the warning letter to Ohio Fresh Eggs CEO John Glessner. No illnesses were reported as a result of the problem.

A copy of the warning letter to Ohio Fresh Eggs was obtained by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. The firm represents victims of the 2010 Salmonella Enteriditis outbreak linked to Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, both of Iowa. In that outbreak, more than 1,900 people were sickened around the country from contaminated eggs.

 Peppers Salmonella Outbreak Revisited 
 Posted on February 25, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A post-mortem of the nationwide peppers Salmonella outbreak from 2008 shows that investigators were kept on the wrong trail for weeks while they relied on faulty food history information collected from victims and struggled to trace product through a convoluted supply chain.

The report was published in The New England Journal of Medicine by scientists from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. It ripped the produce industry for commingling and repacking produce with varying degrees of product documentation throughout the supply chain,

 The report said these problems, and others, kept investigators on the wrong trail for weeks -- chasing what they believed were contaminated raw tomatoes -- while the number of infections continued to climb. Ultimately, the outbreak was linked to Mexican-grown serrano and jalapeno chili peppers based on a breakthrough by the Minnesota Department of Health. By the time the outbreak was over, about 1,500 people in 44 states were sickened and two people died. 

Public awareness of the Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak began in early June 2008, when the FDA warned consumers to avoid eating fresh tomatoes, which it said were the likely cause of the outbreak. Initially it appeared to be related to salsa and/or guacamole served in Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in the Southwest. The report said investigators spent seven weeks on tomato tracebacks, which ultimately failed to&quot;converge on any one geographic location, grower, or supplier,&apos;&apos;

Finally, on July 9, a nationwide alert on hot chili peppers went out. Between the two nationwide alerts, about 500 people fell ill with laboratory-confirmed infections. Eventually, the investigation led to two Mexican farms. At one, officials found Salmonella in irrigation water but it was not the outbreak strain. The other yielded water samples with the Saintpaul serotype. However, the researchers also noted that investigators from Colorado had collected a pepper carrying the outbreak strain from a sick resident&apos;s home and were able to trace it to a different Texas-based distributor, but from there the trail went cold.

National food safety lawyers PritzkerOlsen, P.A., represented victims of this outbreak and is involved on behalf of victims in practically all major outbreaks of Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter, Listeria, Shigella, Hepatitis and other foodborne disease. Our attorney group is one of just a few firms nationally that practices extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions of dollars over the years for victims of food poisoning.

 Silver Lake Firefighters Sickened After Dinner Banquet in Orange County NY 
 Posted on February 23, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A possible food poisoning outbreak is under investigation in Orange County, New York , after a number of firefighters went to the doctor more than a day after eating together at a banquet in Goshen, the county seat.

 Mid-Hudson News Network broke the story, reporting that the possible food poisoning outbreak is being investigated by the Orange County Health Department. Orange County, N.Y., is in the southeast portion of the state. The banquet was attended Saturday night at a catering hall by about 120 people. Health investigators said a number of Silver Lake Fire Department volunteer firefighters got sick and went to the doctor on Monday and Tuesday.

Nausea and vomiting were chief symptoms of the outbreak, a doctor told Mid-Hudson News. National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is monitoring the outbreak and can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by contact form .

 Senator Presses for PCA Prosecution 
 Posted on February 22, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has written to Attorney General Eric Holder urging him to file criminal charges, if appropriate, against Peanut Corporation of America and its president, Stewart Parnell.

 The now-defunct company sold Salmonella -tainted peanuts and peanut products in late 2008 and early 2009 that caused a massive outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium that killed nine people and sickened more than 700 others. Sen. Patrick Leahy&apos;s letter to the attorney general requested an update on the Department of Justice investigation that began in 2009.

Leahy, of Vermont, said last summer&apos;s Salmonella egg outbreak served as a reminder that&quot;there continue to be corporations and individuals that place profitability above public safety.&apos;&apos; When crimes are committed, such wrongdoers must be held fully accountable for their actions, Leahy wrote. Referring to Parnell and the Virginia-based peanut company that Parnell ran, the judiciary chairman wrote that PCA knowingly distributed potentially contaminated peanuts for use in hundreds of different food products even after samples tested positive for Salmonella more than a dozen times in the two years before the outbreak.
 
 &quot;Evidence suggests that PCA also shopped for a laboratory that would provide the acceptable results they were seeking after initial tests found their products to be contaminated. I believe that it is critical for the Department of Justice to determine whether these actions rise to the level of criminal conduct,&apos;&apos; Leahy wrote. 
  In closing, Leahy said Holder should advise his committee if the Justice Department needs additional tools to protect the American people against food poisoning. This week&apos;s letter from Leahy lifted the spirits of family members who have crusaded for a change in food safety laws after witnessing their loved ones die or struggle in numerous outbreaks. Food poisoning law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., continues to represent the families of two who died in the peanut butter outbreak, along with many other cases from other outbreaks around the country.

 Salmonella Prevention Tips for Raising Backyard Chickens and Other Poultry 
 Posted on February 18, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella and chickens go together as surely as roosters crow at dawn, but many people don&apos;t recognize the extent of contamination hazards and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reminds families to take precautions while raising backyard chickens and other poultry. In recent years there have been several human Salmonella outbreaks associated with live poultry contact and the outbreaks are especially threatening to children and others whose immune systems are not fully developed or impaired. Salmonella is believed to be responsible for 35 percent of hospitalizations related to foodborne illness and 28 percent of foodborne deaths . 

It’s common for chickens, ducks, and other poultry to carry Salmonella bacteria in their intestines, which is then shed in their droppings or feces. Even when the animals appear healthy and clean, the germs can live on their feathers, feet, and beaks. The pathogens also spread to cages, coops, hay, plants, and soil in the area where the birds live and roam. Additionally, the germs can be found on the hands, shoes, and clothing of those who handle the birds, feed them or work or play where they live and roam

Here&apos;s a list of live poultry raising precautions urged in a recent posting on CDC&apos;s Public Health Matters blog : 

 Do not let children younger than 5 years of age handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry without supervision. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Avoid touching your mouth before washing your hands. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children. Wash hands after removing soiled clothes and shoes. Do not eat or drink in the area where the birds live or roam. Do not let live poultry inside the house or in areas where food or drink is prepared, served, or stored, such as kitchens, pantries, or outdoor patios. If you have free-roaming live poultry, assume that where they live and roam is contaminated. Clean equipment and materials associated with raising or caring for live poultry, such as cages, feed containers, and water containers, outside the house, not inside.

 Insanitary Maryland Sprout Processor 
 Posted on February 16, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Maryland bean sprout processor has been shut down under court order while the owner addresses insanitary conditions found by public health inspectors. The company is Vegi-Pak Farm LLC of Mount Airy. The situation came to a head last week when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking a permanent injunction against the facility until it could be brought into compliance with food safety laws.

 Vegi-Pak General Manager Brian Lee told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that the company is complying with a consent decree that details a list of required actions, including cleaning the facility, storing seeds safely and treating them to reduce pathogens. There has not been a known outbreak of Salmonella or E. coli linked to the plant, but sprouts are susceptible to contamination even in plants that are in general compliance with food safety laws. That&apos;s because they are cultivated with heat and moisture, conditions that also favor   clustering of E. coli, Salmonella and other harmful human pathogens.
 
  Since 1996, there have been 32 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by Salmonella and E. coli infections. 
 
The most recent multi-state outbreak started last November and sickened 140 individuals with Salmonella through February 9, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In that outbreak, the investigation indicated a link to eating Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts at Jimmy John’s restaurant outlets. Half of the illnesses were in Illinois, where Jimmy John&apos;s and Tiny Greens are based.

Before the shut-down, Vegi-Pak had been processing and packaging tofu and soybean and mung bean sprouts distributed to Korean markets in Maryland, Virginia and Washington. According to the DOJ complaint, Food and Drug Administration inspectors found equipment coated in food waste and a fly infestation inside the facility in September. In addition, workers were not adequately washing and cleaning the soybeans, and reported they were instructed by the company president to fabricate disinfection records, according to the complaint. A state inspection also found problems.

 Salmonella Outbreak Victims Want Charges 
 Posted on February 13, 2011 by PritzkerLaw Salmonella outbreak victims killed or sickened by peanut products distributed by now-defunct Peanut Corporation of America deserve a renewed criminal investigation of acts of negligence by company officials, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro has said.   The ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee issued a statement on Friday in conjuction with a gathering of outraged victims from the outbreak, which killed nine people and sickened more than 700 others across the country in late 2008 and early 2009. Randy Napier of Ohio, whose mother was the ninth person to die in the outbreak, is among the core group of victims who remain upset that no criminal charges have been filed against Peanut Corporation of America&apos;s chief executive, Stewart Parnell . Napier and his siblings, along with other the family of the late Doris Flatgard of Minnesota, are represented in civil action by food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen P.A.   DeLauro, who represents the third district from Connecticut, strongly urged the Department of Justice to renew focus on the investigation. If federal authorities find the company has acted with willful negligence, DOJ should move forward with prosecuting the appropriate parties responsible, DeLauro said.   DeLauro was a supporter of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act that President Obama signed into law last month, but she continues to press for the creation of a single food safety agency to streamline the work currently done by 15 federal agencies that currently share jurisdiction in protecting our food supply.  Tags: Food Poisoning Attorney , Peanut Butter Lawsuit , Salmonella Death Lawsuit , Salmonella Lawyer , peanut corporation of America lawsuit

 Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak Sickens 140 People in 26 States and D.C. 
 Posted on February 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella outbreak in Illinois and 25 other states has sickened 140 individuals since November 1, 2010, according to the final update on the outbreak by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results of the federal investigation indicated a link to eating Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts at Jimmy John&apos;s restaurant outlets.

Exactly half of the 140 illnesses were in Illinois, the state where Jimmy John&apos;s and Tiny Greens are based. Twenty-three cases were from Missouri, 13 from Indiana and four were from Wisconsin. The other states and the District of Columbia had one or two each. 

The outbreak strain of Salmonella serotype  I 4,[5],12:i:- was not found in any sprouts, but it was found in a sample of water run-off at Tiny Greens&apos; growing facility. Case-patients range in age from 1 to 85 years-old, with a median age of 28 years-old. Eighty-seven patients, or 63 percent, are female. Among persons with available information, 24 percent reported being hospitalized. No deaths were reported. 

If you or a loved one is a confirmed case patient of this outbreak, your questions about a possible sprouts Salmonella lawsuit can be answered by an attorney at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation. PritzkerOlsen is representing victims from this outbreak, including an Illinois women who ate at Jimmy John&apos;s and became hospitalized from her illness.

 Quarry Hill Salmonella Outbreak Probed 
 Posted on February 11, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak  that killed one person and hospitalized another in Camden, Maine, remains under investigation two weeks after seven residents of the extended care facility first fell ill with diarrhea, painful stomach cramps and vomiting. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention disclosed the outbreak in a newspaper story published by Bangor Daily News this week.

 Even if the cause of the Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak is not traced back to a certain food item, victims of the outbreak and their families may still have legal claims to pursue against Quarry Hill or others. Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the very few attorney groups in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation, is conducting its own investigation of the outbreak. The firm currently represents victims of nursing home Salmonella outbreaks in Ohio and Minnesota, including the families of two care facility residents who died from Salmonella infection  in the peanut butter outbreak two years ago. The two Salmonella wrongful death lawsuits are still pending against the company whose brand name -- King Nut -- was on the peanut butter. 

When the Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak hit in late January, PritzkerOlsen founder and president Fred Pritzker was in Boston to speak about food poisoning litigation at the annual law symposium held by the Northeastern University Law Journal at Northeastern University. Foodborne illness is preventable and the firm is actively involved in various efforts to keep dangerous pathogens like Samonella out of the food supply.

Families whose loved ones were killed or sickened in the Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak may have legal questions about pursuing a rightful claim for compensation of medical bills and other harms. Mr. Pritzker will answer inquiries and provide a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing our online contact form .

 Maine Salmonella Death at Nursing Home 
 Posted on February 10, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella death in Camden, Maine, is the tragic outcome of a Salmonella outbreak that sickened at least seven residents of the Quarry Hill nursing home. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the Bangor Daily News that the man died February 2 at Penobscot Bay Medical Center.

 Staff at the Camden facility first became aware of the  Salmonella outbreak on January 24, when several residents became ill with symptoms that included diarrhea, cramps, headache, fever and vomiting, the Daily News reported. Another resident was hospitalized but is expected to return to Quarry Hill this week. The care facility has 150 residents. Quarry Hill spokesman Christopher Burke told the newspaper that the affected residents lived in the assisted living and memory impairment assisted living wings of the facility. The person who died lived in the assisted living wing and initially declined treatment for his illness, Burke told the Daily News. 

Dr. Stephen Sears, acting director of the Maine CDC, said the cause of the Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak has not been determined. Two epidemiologists from the state went to Quarry Hill to investigate and work with staff to increase their education about salmonellosis . The outbreak type is Salmonella javiana. Sears told the paper that the outbreak appears to be slowing down, with no new cases reported in days.

Most people who have been infected by Salmonella bacteria develop symptoms between 12 and 72 hours, and the illness usually lasts 4-7 days. Every year, more than 100,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States, with approximately 400 people dying of the infection. Young children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are most likely to have severe infections. More people die of Salmonella poisoning in the U.S. than from any other type of foodborne illness.
 
 Salmonella lawyer Fred Pritzker, who has been representing victims of foodborne illness outbreaks for years, is calling on Quarry Hill to immediately pay all medical expenses of the victims while the investigation continues and before legal claims for compensation are formalized. Pritzker&apos;s law firm handled several nursing home Salmonella death cases in the widely followed peanut butter Salmonella outbreak that killed nine people and sickened more than 700. Mr. Pritzker&apos;s firm was one of just a few at the center of negotiations to distribute $12 million in insurance funds to victims of the outbreak. Salmonella lawsuits from that outbreak are still pending. 
 
If your loved one has been killed or sickened in the Camden Quarry Hill Salmonella outbreak, contact Fred at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our onlline contact form . Earlier this month, Mr. Pritzker was in Boston for a major speaking engagement on foodborne illness at Northeastern University.

 Families Want Criminal Prosecution for Salmonella Deaths Caused by PCA 
 Posted on February 9, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Nine Salmonella death cases in the 2008-2009 peanut butter Salmonella outbreak caused a furor in the U.S., but never resulted in criminal charges against officials from the company linked to the outbreak -- Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) of Lynchburg, Virginia.

 On Friday at the American University Washington College of Law in Washington, D.C., Randy Napier of Ohio and Salmonella victims from five other families will be sharing their stories and calling for criminal prosecution of Stewart Parnell, who was PCA&apos;s chief executive leading up to the outbreak. Parnell liquidated the company in post-outbreak bankruptcy proceedings and he refused to testify before Congress about evidence gleaned by investigators showing that the company shipped products that initially tested positive for Salmonella . Federal authorities launched a criminal investigation, but two years have passed without indicments. 

Nellie Napier, Randy&apos;s mother, was the last to die from the contaminated peanut butter sold by PCA under the King Nut brand. She was living in an extended care facility and peanut butter was one of her comfort foods. It wasn&apos;t until two days after her death that PCA announced its sweeping recall of all products dating back to 2007. Speaking on behalf of his siblings, Randy has repeatedly voiced outrage over the tragedy and continues to pursue a Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit . He and his extended family are represented by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. The same firm represents the family of a second fatal victim of the outbreak, as well as others who were sickened.
 
 The press conference will be held concurrently with the Government Accountability Project (GAP) Food Integrity Campaign Conference and will begin at 12:30PM EST. Victims will speak for approximately five minutes each and be open for questions following their statements. 
 
Besides causing nine Salmonella deaths, the PCA peanut product outbreak sickened more than 714 people in more than 40 states. PritzkerOlsen was one of just three law firms representing victimsof the outbreak that were central to gaining a court-approved settlement that distributed $12 million of PCA insurance money to victims.

 FDA Inspects Sprout Grower in Illinois 
 Posted on February 7, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Sprout growner Tiny Greens of Urbana, Illinois, was inspected by the FDA after alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts sold to Jimmy John&apos;s and elsewhere were implicated in a multi-state Salmonella outbreak that started late last year. The sprouts Salmonella outbreak has sickened more than 125 people in 22 states and Washington, D.C.

 FDA investigators observed unsafe plant conditions, including many employee movements that could potentially cross-contaminated the plant with harmful bacteria. In addition, testing found the outbreak strain of Salmonella in pooled run-off water draining from an outdoor compost pile. The FDA report said an employee wearing a red hooded sweatshirt was seen dumping production waste into the compost pile before returning to the production area wearing the same clothing. The report said the company grew sprouts in&quot;soil from the organic material decomposed outside&quot;without using any monitored&quot;kill step&quot;to neutralize bacteria.

Here&apos;s a quick summary of some of the other observations at the Tiny Greens plant:

 There was a pet&quot;amphibian/reptile&apos;&apos; in the reception area of the firm. &quot;Biofilm-like material&apos;&apos; was built up around a plastic brace on a sprouting tray. There were rough welds, organic matter buildup and perforations on the food contact surface of a stainless steel table used to package alfalfa sprouts. Sprouts are dumped directly onto the table to be placed in packaging. Mold-like formations were seen on the walls and up in the ceiling above the mung bean sprouting room. The firm&apos;s microbiological testing was observed as&quot;not adequate to monitor pathogen contamination.&apos;&apos;  

 Salmonella lawyer Fred Pritzker is representing victims of the sprouts Salmonella outbreak, including a woman from Illinois who was hospitalized for several days with a Salmonella infection contracted after eating alfalfa sprouts on a Jimmy John&apos;s sandwich. Mr. Pritzker, who is a leading national foodborne illness attorney, is continuing to accept new cases from this outbreak and can be at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Salmonella Death and Illness Studied by Pathogen Researchers at Yale 
 Posted on February 4, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Yale researchers have discovered something about  Salmonella that might lead to a new class of anit-microbial therapies that would neutralize the pathogen once inside the human body.

 The findings were published this week in Science Express and summarized by the university&apos;s public relations department. Salmonella is a leading cause of food poisoning in the United States -- the No. 1 cause of food poisoning hospitalizations and deaths. Salmonella outbreaks sicken 1.2 million people annually and kill about 400, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Yale research is all the more interesting because Salmonella and other pathogens have been showing resistance to traditional antibiotics. According to Yale sources, here&apos;s what the new study by senior author Jorge Galan found:
 
 Salmonella bacteria rely on a sorting platform or molecular machine that attracts needed proteins and lines them up in a specific order. If the proteins do not line up properly, Salmonella, as well as many other bacterial pathogens, cannot&quot;inject&quot;them into host cells to commandeer host cell functions. Understanding how this machine works raises the possibility that new therapies can be developed which disable this protein delivery machine and therefore thwart the ability of the bacterium to become pathogenic. This process would not kill the bacteria as most antibiotics do, but would cripple its ability to do harm.

 Egg Farm Inspections Find More Salmonella 
 Posted on February 1, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
Following last year&apos;s egg Salmonella outbreak , which sickened nearly 2,000 people around the country from May through November, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set out to inspect 600 facilities where 80 percent of the nation&apos;s egg supply originates.

Through December, FDA had inspected 35 egg farms in Ohio, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah and Washington. They were chosen because they had been associated with previous outbreaks or had a history of poor compliance. Nine separate companies operate the 35 farms.  
 According to the Washington Post, inspectors found 76 positive swabs of Salmonella in facilities owned by one producer. All together, 12 of the 35 farms inspected so far needed to take action to fix problems. Eleven others did not. Evaluations of the remaining 12 farms are still pending. The FDA did not name any of the farms in its initial report.  Most of the problems cited by the agency involve inadequate record keeping, but inspectors found one hen house with inadequate control of rodents, which are known to spread Salmonella bacteria. The egg farm inspections are expected to be completed in 2010.   Public health investigators from 11 states, the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) combined efforts last year to track a widespread outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis to Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, and Hillandale Farms of Iowa Inc. When the FDA inspected the facilities, they found substantial potential for Salmonella to have persisted in the environment and to have contaminated eggs. Combined, the two mega-farms recalled more than 550 million shell eggs and temporarily stopped mass market sales.   An egg Salmonella lawsuit is pending and national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is representing victims of the outbreak. Attorneys are continuing to accept new cases from those who received confirmation of Salmonella infection matching the DNA fingerprint of the outbreak strain. Call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our online contact form to talk to an attorney and to receive a free case consultation. Our law firm has collected millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning and is actively involved in multiple efforts to prevent foodborne illness in the United States.

 Sprouters Northwest Inspection Report Indicates Observations of Concern 
 Posted on January 30, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Salmonella sprouts outbreak associated with clover sprouts from Sprouters Northwest prompted an FDA inspection that noted eight areas of observational concern about the cleanliness and condition of equipment and facilities.

 According to a copy of Form 483 completed by the team of five FDA inspectors, problems they observed ranged from leaky roof, rodent harborage, food buildup on equipment, potential cross-contamination of sprout bins and the presence of Listeria monocytogenes on a production table.

Sprouters Northwest Inc. of Kent, Washington, recalled all clover and clover mix products because they had the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella . The sprouts were associated with at least 7 illnesses in Washington and Oregon. In addition, Wal-Mart of British Columbia, Canada, also has recalled Sprouters Northwest brand Deli Sprouts in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The company&apos;s recall included clover sprouts, Brocco sandwich sprouts, Deli sprouts, clover onion sprouts and Spicy sprouts.

 The observations of concern as listed in the report were backed up by specific examples, but here are the 8 overall observations:  

 Failure to take necessary precautions to protect against contamination of food and food contact surfaces with microorganisms and foreign substances. Failure to clean food-contact surfaces as frequently as necessary to protect against contamination of food. Failure to clean non-food-contact surfaces of equipment as frequently as necessary to protect against contamination. Effective measures are not being taken to protect against the contamination of food on the premises by pests. Failure to store equipment, remove litter and cut weeds that may be an attractant to pests.  Failure to maintain buildings, fixtures and other facilities in sanitary condition. Failure to hold raw material in bulk in suitable containers. Failure to maintain buildings and physical facilities in repair sufficient to prevent food from becoming adulterated.

 Tiny Greens Salmonella Outbreak Hits Illinois, Missouri Indiana Hardest 
 Posted on January 17, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The Tiny Greens Salmonella outbreak linked to sprouts and associated with Jimmy John&apos;s has hit hardest in Illinois, Missouri and Indiana. That&apos;s where 99 of the 125 confirmed illnesses have occurred according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 The outbreak strain of Salmonella has infected 65 in Illinois, 22 in Missouri and 12 in Indiana. Overall, the outbreak has been detected in 22 states and the District of Columbia, but no other state has reported more than 3 cases. 

Public health and regulatory agencies have linked this outbreak to consumption of Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts. The sprouts were distributed to various customers, including farmers’markets, restaurants, and groceries in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri and may also have been distributed to other Midwestern states. 

In Illinois, many of the ill individuals ate sandwiches containing sprouts at various Jimmy John’s outlets in at least nine counties. FDA and the Illinois Department of Public Health conducted an inspection of Tiny Greens Organic Farm in Urbana, Illinois. Thus far, one water run-off sample yielded the Salmonella outbreak strain.

A public claims center for this Tiny Greens and Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella sprouts outbreak has been established by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. for a sprouts lawsuit on behalf of those who have been sickened.  A full analysis of your case and further investigation is necessary to determine the parties that you have a right to sue and how much your case is worth.

 Sprouts Salmonella Outbreak Expands 
 Posted on January 15, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
The sprout Salmonella outbreak linked to consumption of Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts peaked in late November and early December but new cases have continued to be confirmed by medical professionals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

From November 1, 2010, through January 11, 2011, 125 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella serotype I 4,[5],12:i:-, have been reported from 22 states and the District of Columbia -- that&apos;s up from 18 states in the previous CDC report. CDC said results of the investigation indicate a link to eating Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts at Jimmy John’s restaurant outlets.

 At Tiny Greens in Urbana, Illinois, FDA testing of a water run-off sample found the Salmonella outbreak strain of bacteria. Based on all information, CDC continues to warn that consumers should not eat recalled Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts or Spicy Sprouts, and restaurant and food service operators should not serve them. 

Individuals sickened in this outbreak in Illinois and elsewhere may be interested in becoming part of a sprouts Salmonella lawsuit or Jimmy John&apos;s lawsuit . Outbreak attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., currently represent victims and are continuing to accept new cases. Get a free consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing our contact form for Salmonella claims. Our law firm has collected millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning and is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation.

More than 20 percent of the victims in this Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella outbreak linked to Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy Sprouts have been hospitalized for treatment after suffering painful diarrhea. Some Salmonella infections develop into life-threatening illness, but no one has died in this outbreak. A potential risk for victims is developing arterial infections, reactive arthritis, which also is known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome . 
 CDC Breakdown of Sprout Salmonella Outbreak Illnesses :   The number of ill persons identified in each state and the District of Columbia with the outbreak strain is as follows: Arkansas (1), California (1), Colorado (1), Connecticut (1), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (1), Hawaii (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (65), Indiana (12), Kentucky (1), Massachusetts (2), Missouri (22), Nebraska (1), Nevada (1), New York (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (3), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (2), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (3). Case-patients range in age from 1 to 85 years-old, with a median age of 28 years-old. Eighty-three patients (or 67%) are female. Because the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern associated with this particular Salmonella serotype commonly occurs in the United States, some of the cases identified may not be related to this outbreak.   About half of the illnesses occurred in Illinois, where many of the ill individuals ate sandwiches containing sprouts at various Jimmy John’s outlets. FDA and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) conducted an inspection of Tiny Greens Organic Farm. FDA collected both product and environmental samples. Thus far, product samples tested by FDA are negative.    Since 1996, there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by Salmonella and E. coli. Some epidemiologists say you should avoid eating sprouts, especially if you are pregnant, very young, elderly or immuno-compromised in some other way.

 Sprouts Salmonella Outbreak Investigations 
 Posted on January 12, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella outbreak investigations are active involving alfalfa sprouts in 18 states and clover sprouts in the Northwest.

Sprouters Northwest, Inc. of Kent, Washington, has recalled all clover and clover mix products because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.  The sprouts have been associated with at least six illnesses in Washington and Oregon and Wal-Mart of British Columbia, Canada, also has recalled Sprouters Northwest brand Deli Sprouts in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The company&apos;s recall includes clover sprouts, Brocco sandwich sprouts, Deli sprouts, clover onion sprouts and Spicy sprouts.

 Sprouters Northwest suspended production while FDA, other agencies and the company itself investigate the source of the problem. No deaths have been reported, though Salmonella is potentially lethal, especially in young children, the elderly and others who have compromised immune systems.

In the Midwest, Tiny Greens Organic Farm of Urbana, Illinois, announced a recall late last year in connection with an 18-state Salmonella outbreak also impacting Washington, D.C. At least 112 people have been sickened, including more than 20 percent hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that results of the Salmonella outbreak investigation in Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and beyond indicate a link to eating Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts at Jimmy John’s restaurant outlets. Meanwhile, Jimmy John&apos;s is quoted in a food industry trade magazine saying its corporate stores are switching from serving alfalfa sprouts to clover sprouts and is urging franchisees to do the same. Are they not aware of the clover sprouts Salmonella outbreak in the Northwest? 

Both of these Salmonella outbreaks, sprouts related, are under investigation by PritzkerOlsen, P.A., and the firm is representing an Illinois woman who was hospitalized with Salmonella infection for nearly a week after eating sprouts from Jimmy John&apos;s. If you have been sickened in either one of these outbreaks, contact a Salmonella attorney at the firm to inquire about a sprouts Salmonella lawsuit .

 Illinois, Missouri Are Leading States in Salmonella Sprouts Outbreak 
 Posted on January 6, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 Illinois and Missouri account for 81 of 112 confirmed Salmonella illnesses in an outbreak where results of the investigation indicate a link to eating Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts at Jimmy John’s restaurant outlets.

The sprouts Salmonella outbreak spreads across 18 states and the District of Columbia, according to the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). No deaths have been reported, but more than 20 percent of victims have been treated at a hospital. Seventy-five patients, or 68 percent, are female and the ages of case patients range from 1 to 75 years old.  

In Missouri, the Department of Health and Senior Services was notified of the outbreak in late December by the FDA. Just before Christmas, there were 16 Missouri cases occurring in Franklin, St. Charles, Jefferson, Lewis, and St. Louis Counties, and in Kansas City. The CDC update said the number of Missouri residents sickened with the same strain of Salmonella has since jumped to 22.

Tiny Greens and Jimmy John&apos;s are both based in Illinois, where the Illinois Department of Public Health initially announced the outbreak on December 17. The first known onset of illness in the outbreak was on November 1. The CDC currently counts 59 illnesses in Illinois.

 Jimmy John&apos;s Sprouts Outbreak Update: Illinois and Missouri Hit Hardest 
 Posted on January 6, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts and certain Jimmy John&apos;s restaurants in Illinois now has 112 reported cases in 18 states and the District of Columbia as follows:

California (1), Colorado (1), Connecticut (1), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (1), Hawaii (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (59), Indiana (10), Kentucky (1), Massachusetts (2), Missouri (22), New York (1), Pennsylvania (3), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (1), Texas (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (3).

Only certain Jimmy John&apos;s restaurants in Illinois have been implicated in this outbreak.

From November 1, 2010, through January 4, 2011, CDC received report of 112 cases of  Salmonella serotype I 4,[5],12:i:-. 

Among 111 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from November 1 to December 24, 2010. Case-patients range in age from 1 to 75 years-old, with a median age of 28 years-old. Seventy-five patients (or 68%) are female. Among persons with available information, 24% reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Because the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern associated with this particular Salmonella serotype commonly occurs in the United States, some of the cases identified may not be related to this outbreak.

Our law firm is representing a woman from Illinois who was hospitalized for several days with a Salmonella infection contracted after eating alfalfa sprouts on a Jimmy John&apos;s sandwich. She developed a type of reactive arthritis called Reiter&apos;s syndrome .

 Salmonella Suspected in Sprouts Again; Outbreak in Washington and Oregon 
 Posted on January 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw 
For the second time in six days, an alfalfa sprouts supplier has issued a recall because the sprouts have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella . 

Late last week it was Tiny Greens Organic Farm Food Co. of Illinois recalling all alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts from November 1 - December 21. Public health officials say the sprouts are associated with a 16-state outbreak of Salmonella that has sickened more than 90 people, more than half of whom are from Illinois. Many of the outbreak victims in Illinois reported eating sprouts at Jimmy John&apos;s.

 Now Sprouters Northwest, Inc. of Kent, Washington, is recalling all of its clover and clover mix products because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, older adults and others with weakened immune systems. Sprouters Northwest said it is cooperating with state and federal investigators to find the source of the contamination. Meanwhile, production has been suspended. 

A press release from the Washington State Department of Health said the recalled sprouts are connected to an outbreak of Salmonella Newport that has sickened four people in Washington and two in Oregon. The Washington cases of Salmonella Newport occurred in mid-December among residents of Benton, King, Kitsap, and Grays Harbor counties. The recalled clover products were distributed in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska in retail chains and through wholesale distribution.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, Salmonella infection can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome .

If you or someone you love has been sickened by Salmonella after consuming contaminated alfalfa sprouts, your questions about a potential sprouts  Salmonella lawsuit  will be answered by an attorney at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food safety law firm that has collected millions for victims of food poisoning. Our firm already represents an Illinois woman who was hospitalized with Salmonellosis after eating alfalfa sprouts on a Jimmy John&apos;s sandwich

 Illinois Salmonella Updates to Resume 
 Posted on January 3, 2011 by PritzkerLaw Public health updates are scheduled to resume today from Illinois regarding the 2-month-old Salmonella outbreak in which many case patients reported eating alfalfa sprouts at Jimmy John&apos;s restaurants in 14 Illinois counties - Adams, Bureau, Champaign, Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kankakee, Lake, Macon, McHenry, McLean, Peoria, Will and Winnebago.   The same strain of Salmonella is present in 15 other states and the District of Columbia as tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Investigators last week pegged the number of confirmed outbreak cases at approximately 94, with more than half occurring in Illinois.   CDC said preliminary results of the investigation indicate a link to eating Tiny Greens brand Alfalfa Sprouts and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release advising consumers not to eat Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy Sprouts (which contain alfalfa sprouts mixed with radish and clover sprouts) from Tiny Greens Organic Farm of Urbana, Illinois. The recalled sprouts were distributed to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri, and may also have been distributed to other Midwestern states.   Since Nov. 1, 2010, the Illinois Department of Public Health has received confirmed reports of 57 Illinois residents and one Wisconsin resident with Salmonella serotype I 4,5, 12,i- who ate at a Jimmy John&apos;s. The department said late last week that information on the outbreak would be updated weekdays at 11 a.m. The other leading states in the outbreak are Missouri (17 cases), Indiana (9) and Wisconsin (3).   More than 20 percent of victims in this Salmonella sprouts outbreak tied in part to Jimmy John&apos;s have been hospitalized, including an Illinois woman represented by food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.

 Salmonella Lawyer calls on Illinois Sprouts Supplier and Jimmy John&apos;s to Pay Victims 
 Posted on December 31, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 In connection with the Illinois Salmonella sprouts outbreak , the following press release was issued today by Business Wire: 

Food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker is calling on Jimmy John’s and alfalfa sprouts supplier Tiny Greens Organic Farm to immediately pay medical expenses and other costs incurred by victims of a Salmonella outbreak that has been associated with consumption of alfalfa sprouts at certain Jimmy John’s restaurants.

The CDC and FDA, working with state partners, have announced a preliminary link between Tiny Greens alfalfa sprouts and the outbreak. Approximately half of the illnesses occurred in Illinois, where many of the ill individuals ate sandwiches containing sprouts at various Jimmy John’s, the CDC has said. Tiny Greens and Jimmy John’s are both based in Illinois. Other states involved in the outbreak include California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the CDC.

While Jimmy John’s sprouts Salmonella litigation is pending, the companies should quickly alleviate the acute financial burden on victims who have lost wages and incurred substantial medical bills.

&quot;It is only fair that Jimmy John’s and Tiny Greens pay for hospitalization and other direct costs while related legal issues, including pain and suffering, are pending,’’Pritzker said.“The families deserve that peace of mind.’’

Attorney Fred Pritzker can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by our contact form for a free case consultation .

 IL IN MO Salmonella Outbreak from Sprouts 
 Posted on December 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella in alfalfa sprouts is nothing new in the world of foodborne illness and there is a long history of outbreaks and related Salmonella sprouts litigation to help survivors recover financially from illnesses that can be severe and even fatal.

 A Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella sprouts investigation is currently active under the combined resources of FDA, state partners and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From November 1 to December 21, 2010, a total of 89 individuals with a matching strain of Salmonella serotype I 4,[5],12:i:- have been reported from 15 states and the District of Columbia.  The three leading states are Illinois (50), Missouri (14) and Indiana (9). Wisconsin has three cases. Twenty-three percent of case patients report being hospitalized. Food history interviews with case patients identified sprouts on Jimmy John&apos;s sandwiches as one possible cause of the outbreak and the Illinois-based restaurant chain has pulled sprouts from its menus in Illinois.

While the investigation and testing continues, PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is providing free case consultations to anyone who has fallen ill. Contact a Salmonella lawyer at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the form on the side of this Web page. We have years of experience in food poisoning litigation against national restaurant chains and major food suppliers and we have collected millions for our clients.

Alfalfa sprouts have been considered a healthy component of a balanced diet. However, due to the risk of contamination, the FDA has made recommendations against eating the raw sprouts. For instance, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and persons with weakened immune systems should avoid eating raw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts.
 Sprouts should be cooked thoroughly to reduce the risk of illness. Cooking kills the harmful bacteria. Request that raw sprouts not be added to your food. If you purchase a sandwich or salad at a restaurant, check to make sure that raw sprouts have not been added.   According to the CDC, since 1996, there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by Salmonella and E. coli.   The last major Salmonella sprouts outbreak occurred from February through April of last year when a Nebraska sprouter was associated with 235 illnesses in 14 states.   Tags: Illinois Outbreak , Jimmy Johns , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawsuit , sprouts salmonella outbreak

 Posted on December 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
An Illinois Jimmy John&apos;s Salmonella investigation in nine counties is centered on alfalfa sprouts -- a popular sandwich topping that public health officials suspect may have sickened at least 46 people with the same strain of Salmonella serotype I 4,5,12,i- 

According to a press release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, many people who have become ill reported eating alfalfa sprouts at Jimmy John’s restaurants in Adams, Champaign, Cook, Kankakee, McHenry, McLean, Peoria, Will and Winnebago counties. The 46 Salmonella infection reports have been received by the department since November 1. 

 Sprouts and Salmonella form a familiar combination in foodborne illness histories tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In May of this year, Caldwell Fresh Foods of Maywood, California., recalled alfalfa sprouts after more than two dozen people in 10 states had been sickened with the same strain of Salmonella. Other companies recalled sprouts in July, August and October after testing confirmed Salmonella or Listeria. No illnesses were linked to those recalls.

 The corporate headquarters of Jimmy John&apos;s is in Champaign, Illinois. The state health department said that in the course of its ongoing investigation, the department is investigating alfalfa sprout producers and suppliers. Produce testing for Salmonella is ongoing.

 Posted on December 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Alfalfa sprout distributors and suppliers to Jimmy Johns restaurants in Illinois are being investigated and their produce is being tested for Salmonella matching a specific strain that has sickened at least 46 people from nine Illinois counties.

According to the latest foodborne illness estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Salmonella bacteria is the leading cause of hospitalization and death among victims of food poisoning across the United States.

 Salmonella Egg Culprit Back in Business 
 Posted on November 30, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Wright County Egg LLC, one of two Iowa egg producers deemed at fault for this year&apos;s massive egg Salmonella outbreak, has received FDA approval to resume shipping shell eggs directly to consumers. Since the August shutdown of normal operations at Wright County Egg, Salmonella egg litigation has cropped up in several states based on government findings confirming a link with the multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis. 

FDA&apos;s concurrence for the resumption of normal marketing extends only to eggs from two hen houses on one of six farms operated by Wright County Egg. The other company linked to the outbreak, Hillandale Farms of Iowa, was previously cleared to resume sale of shell eggs to consumers.
 
 “During the outbreak, I said that FDA would not agree to the sale of eggs to consumers from Wright County Egg until we had confidence that they could be shipped and consumed safely,”FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg said in a news release. “After four months of intensive work by the company and oversight, testing, and inspections by FDA, I am satisfied that time has come.”  
 
FDA said its decision is based on the agency’s verification that the company has taken corrective measures in these two hen houses to address dirty egg laying environments, contaminated young chickens, contaminated feed and rodents.

FDA said it will continue to conduct environmental and egg sampling and will conduct periodic inspections to verify the safety measures in place. Corrective actions continue to be implemented for Wright County Egg’s remaining houses.

Meanwhile, national food safety lawyers at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., continue to accept new cases from families and individuals sickened in the outbreak. Our firm has filed a Salmonella egg lawsuit against Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms on behalf of victims of this outbreak in an attempt to recover medical expenses, lost wages, travel expense and compensation for pain and suffering . To discuss your case with a Salmonella egg lawyer at the firm, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete the electronic contact form on the side of this Web page. A lawyer will respond to you.

The Frederick County Health Department has been working with Homewood nursing home officials to determine the cause of contamination but so far the cause for the Salmonella bacteria has not been determined.  &quot;We are still monitoring the situation,&apos;&apos; Darlene Armacost, communicable disease program manager for the Frederick County Health Department told the Frederick News Post newspaper. 
 Health department officials have inspected Homewood repeatedly, Armacost said. The entire Environmental Health Services branch of the department, the section that inspects restaurants, has visited the kitchen many times, she told the newspaper. Health department staff have also reviewed proper sanitation procedures, including the importance of hand washing and the use of hand sanitizers when no sink is available, Armacost said. Employees also have been tested for the pathogen.   The elderly are at increased risk for severe illness from Salmonella, a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Salmonellosis usually lasts four to seven days, but there is a risk of bloodstream infection that can have long-lasting negative health effects. One possible complication is reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s syndrome.   Families whose loved one have been sickened in this outbreak may have legal questions about compensation for medical bills and pain and suffering.

 SD Salmonella Cluster in Brown Country 
 Posted on November 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
South Dakota state health officials are investigating a cluster of Salmonella illnesses in Brown County following four confirmed cases of Salmonellosis in the past week. The South Dakota Department of Health notes in a press release that at least 20 other Brown County children have been ill, potentially from  Salmonella , but not confirmed.

 A public health probe is searching for the source of this Brown County SD Salmonella outbreak. . Through November 23, a total of 154 cases of Salmonellosis were reported in South Dakota for the year. Of these 154 cases, 23 (15 percent) have been from Brown County. Statewide, 31 percent of the Salmonella cases have been children 14 years and younger.  Salmonella infection is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or water or from contact with feces from infected people or animals.

Lon Kightlinger, State Epidemiologist for the South Dakota Department of Health, took the opportunity to recommend that consumers take the following precautions when cooking their holiday meals:

 Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw poultry or meat. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Keep raw poultry, meat and fish away from other foods that won’t be cooked and use separate cutting boards for the raw products. Cook poultry and meat to safe internal temperatures and use a food thermometer to check - 165°F for poultry and 160°F for beef and pork.  Refrigerate raw poultry and meat within two hours after purchase. Cooked turkey and meat should also be refrigerated within two hours after cooking.  If you have diarrhea or vomiting, do not prepare food for others to eat. 
 Salmonella infection can result in diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. But young children, the elderly and others with underdeveloped or weakened immune systems are at risk for more severe illness that may require hospitalization or care for long-term negative affects.   Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., represents victims of food poisoning and is following the Brown County Salmonella outbreak. To contact a Salmonella lawyer about your case, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Frederick MD Nursing Home Salmonella 
 Posted on November 24, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A  Salmonella outbreak at Homewood at Crumland Farms nursing home in Frederick, Maryland, has sickened eight people, including one resident who died after being hospitalized with the infection. The Frederick News Post quoted Frederick County Health Department and the nursing home&apos;s executive director as saying the outbreak started in July and has continued into November.

 A second person hospitalized in the Homewood at Crumland Farms Salmonella outbreak has returned to the home, said Eric Nichols, Homewood&apos;s executive director. He said the person who died had other health complications.

A Salmonella outbreak at a nursing home is particularly risky because young children, the elderly and others with weakened immune systems are most susceptiple to severe illness. In the 2008-2009 peanut butter Salmonella outbreak that swept the United States, law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., represented the families of three older adults who died with the outbreak strain of Salmonella . The firm has recovered money for the survivors and is continuing to press wrongful death Salmonella lawsuits against parties responsible for the sale and distribution of contaminated peanut butter.

The Homewood Salmonella outbreak in Maryland is still under investigation and no source has yet been revealed.
 Darlene Armacost, communicable disease program manager for the Frederick County Health Department, told Frederick News Post that the last onset of a case was in early November and, &quot;We are still monitoring the situation.&quot; Health department officials have inspected Homewood repeatedly, Armacost said. The entire Environmental Health Services branch of the department, the section that inspects restaurants, has visited the kitchen many times, she said. Employees have been tested. The cause may never be known, she said.   Salmonella causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people recover without treatment, but in some people the infection may spread to the bloodstream and to other parts of the body. Reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , is one of the potential complications.   If you or a loved one has been sickened in this Frederick, Maryland, Salmonella outbreak, an attorney at Pritzker Olsen will provide a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or contact you in response to a completed contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Wrongful Death Lawsuit Filed for the Family of Peanut Butter Salmonella Victim 
 Posted on November 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Our law firm filed a wrongful death lawsuit yesterday on behalf of the family of Nellie Napier, who died after eating peanut butter contaminated with Salmonella . The wrongful death suit was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio against Kanan Enterprises, Inc., doing business as King Nut Companies, an Ohio Corporation. 
In January 2009, while the late Nellie Napier was residing in a nursing home in Medina County, Ohio, she was served peanut butter produced by King Nut Companies. She contracted salmonellosis from the peanut butter and died after a protracted illness on January 26, 2009.


“This lawsuit is about holding an irresponsible company accountable for the food safety shortcuts it took—shortcuts that cost my mother her life,”said Randy Napier, Nellie Napier’s son.“There are other companies responsible for other outbreaks too. We need to send a message that this can’t and won’t be tolerated any more. I don’t want to see anybody else go through what we had to go through.”

According to the complaint, Salmonella Typhimurium was recovered from the container of peanut butter served to Ms. Napier. Testing revealed the Salmonella in the container was a genetic match to over 700 illnesses nationwide linked to Salmonella -contaminated peanut products that had been manufactured with peanuts from Peanut Corporation of America, now bankrupt.

“This company profited by selling products to nursing homes and other institutions that care for the sick and elderly, yet utterly failed to ensure the safety of its product,”said attorney Brendan Flaherty of Pritzker Olsen law firm.“The suit alleges that Kanan’s marketing to nursing homes heightened its duty to sell safe products.”

 Egg Salmonella Threat Documented at Plant by Humane Society 
 Posted on November 17, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
An egg Salmonella threat has been documented in an expose&apos; on abuse and conditions inside a factory farm owned by a leading egg producer, the Humane Society of the United States said in a press release.

 Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the organization, called on the egg industry to embrace cage-free housing systems. Taking proper care of laying hens is an important way to safeguard our food supply. His comments stem from an undercover video project that captured animal abuses and filth in a caged hen facility. The documentary comes on the heels of a major Salmonella egg outbreak and recall involving two Iowa egg producers that were later found to be in violation of food safety rules.

Hillandale Farms of Iowa and Wright County Egg, also of Iowa, recalled 550 million eggs after investigators associated a major Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak with shell eggs from the two companies. Around the country more than 1,800 people were sickened in the outbreak, prompting more than one Salmonella egg lawsuit . Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is continuing to accept additional cases from individuals affected by the outbreak and free consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

According to the Humane Society press release, a Humane Society investigator worked inside a factory egg farm in Texas recently for 28 days and documented multiple abuses and food safety threats, including:

 Birds trapped in cage wires, unable to reach food or water. Cage wires can trap hens&apos; wings, necks, legs and feet, causing other birds to trample the weakened animals, usually resulting in a slow, painful death. Abandoned hens. Live birds were roaming outside their cages, some falling into manure pits. Injuries. Birds had bloody feet and broken legs from cage wires. Overcrowding injuries. multiple birds crammed into one cage, giving each hen only 67 square inches of cage space—less than a sheet of paper on which to live for more than a year. Eggs covered in blood and feces.  

Every one of the last ten published studies comparing cage to cage-free systems found higher Salmonella rates in cage systems, including a 2010 study that found 20 times greater odds of Salmonella infection in caged flocks, the Humane Society said. Click here to see the Humane Society video.

 Salmonella Egg Recall Strikes Again 
 Posted on November 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella egg test result has prompted the recall of 24,000 dozen eggs by the country&apos;s largest maker of shell eggs: Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods Inc.

Published by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the recall applies to eggs supplied to Cal-Maine by Ohio Fresh Eggs of Croton, Ohio. An FDA sample test found Salmonella Enteritidis -- the same type of Salmonella in eggs that sickened more than 1,800 Americans earlier this year in an outbreak linked to two Iowa egg producers. 
 In the latest recall, there have been no confirmed Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses. The previous case prompted an egg lawsuit filed by national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. Egg litigation cases are still being accepted by the firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.   For details about the latest egg recall, including package information and Julian dates, see the FDA egg recall notice . These latest recalled eggs were distributed in Arkansas, California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.  Tags: Egg Class Action , Egg Lawsuit , Salmonella Egg Lawsuit , Salmonella Egg Recall , egg litigation

 Salmonellosis in Restaurant Workers Merits Speedy Outbreak Detection 
 Posted on November 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Doctors who suspect Salmonella infections in patients who are food workers should report the cases to public health officials even before receiving stool culture test results because follow-up of Salmonellosis in food workers can speed the response to restaurant Salmonella outbreaks.

Those are the practical findings of an analysis of Salmonella outbreak surveillance in Minnesota from 1997 through 2004. Researchers reported their results in the November issue of the Journal of Food Protection. Of 4,976 patients with culture-confirmed Salmonella over the study period, 110 (2.2%) were food workers, 20 (18%)of whose cases were linked to illness outbreaks, the group found. 
   The researchers also found that Salmonella shedding is relatively long in food-worker populations, with a median of 22 days, ranging from 1 to 359 days. They said this finding supports the need for more practical solutions to encourage food workers to stay home when they are sick.   Of the 20 food workers associated with outbreaks, 12 were involved in nine independent outbreaks at the restaurants where they worked. The analysis by researchers at the Minnesota Department of Health and University of Minnesota said the identification of the index food worker in six of these outbreaks was critical to the initiation of outbreak investigations that revealed much larger problems. &quot;Food workers should be considered an important source of Salmonella transmission, and those identified through surveillance should raise a high index of suspicion of a possible outbreak at their place of work. Food service managers need to be alert to Salmonella-like illnesses among food workers to facilitate prevention and control efforts, including exclusion of infected food workers or restriction of their duties.&quot; Tags: Restaurant Liability , Salmonella , Salmonella outbreak , Salmonellosis

 Egg Safety Efforts Public and Private 
 Posted on October 29, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Egg safety initiatives are under way in the public and private sectors in the wake of a nationwide egg Salmonella outbreak  that has sickened more than 1,800 people and has been linked to a pair of farms in Iowa.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is primarily responsible for egg safety but has a limited number of inspectors, plans to train USDA egg graders how to catch potential bacterial problems at egg farms and to conduct inspections.
 FDA previously announced plans to inspect every major farm in the nation, starting with operations that have had past trouble with government officials. Sixteen inspections had been carried out by midmonth. The agency expects to conduct about 600 inspections in the next 14 months.   The Des Moines Register reported that the USDA and FDA have been working on ways to better coordinate since shortly after President Obama took office in January 2009. USDA and FDA officials have been meeting to iron out details of how they will work together.   Meanwhile, the Register quoted Howard Magwire, vice president of government relations for the United Egg Producers. The trade group is developing safety standards for the industry that would go beyond federal regulations, Magwire said.   United Egg Producers is developing industry standards that will mirror the FDA&apos;s production rules and go a step further by requiring participating producers to vaccinate all hens against Salmonella , the newspaper said. Because of contamination that the food agency found in feed at one of the Iowa operations, the producers&apos; group also is considering writing sanitation standards for feed mills, Magwire said.   The group is consulting with the FDA in writing the standards and plans to have the basics of the program ready for the organization&apos;s board in January, he said.   The egg Salmonella outbreak caused by Wright County Egg and HIllandale Farms of Iowa remains under investigation by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , FDA, USDA and several state agencies.  An egg claims center has been established for members of the public who have been sickened in the outbreak and wish to join egg litigation spearheaded by law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. The firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for victims of food poisoning.

 Six Months of Egg Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on October 27, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The egg Salmonella outbreak that has spawned multiple egg lawsuits will reach its six month next week with an official illness count that has surpassed 1,800.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the outbreak has spanned the summer and fall, with confirmed Salmonella  Enteritidis cases peaking in July. No deaths have been reported. 

 From May 1 to October 15, public health officials in 11 states since have identified 29 restaurants or event clusters where more than one ill person with the outbreak strain has eaten. Data from these investigations and from site inspections have identified Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa as the sources of this outbreak. Both companies face an egg lawsuit from Salmonella attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the country&apos;s leading food safety law firms.

An online egg lawsuit claims center has been established at PritzkerOlsen for members of the public who have been victimized in this outbreak with Salmonella Enteritidis infection matching the outbreak strain. Click here to reach the Salmonella outbreak claims center or call 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE).

Based on loads of information gathered by inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it appears to the CDC that  Salmonella persisted in the environment at the two plants, including feed, which resulted in the contamination of eggs. Uncontrolled manure piles, mice, wild birds and food safety violations by workers were among the problems documented by inspectors.

PritzkerOlsen sent its own team to the Iowa egg manufacturers for an inspection. The egg lawsuit team collected evidence captured on video of some of the problems. Hillandale has been cleared to sell shell eggs again, but FDA inspectors have not been satisfied with progress at Wright County Egg and the plant is still under restrictions.

 Illinois Subway Salmonella Outbreak Report 
 Posted on October 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Illinois Subway Salmonella Outbreak that sickened at least 97 customers at 49 Subway locations in late April, May and June was likely caused by contaminated lettuce, tomatoes or olives from a common supplier, according to a report by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

 Produce samples did not test positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Hvittingfoss, but detailed questionnaires of victims indicated the probability of the three sandwich toppings as the cause. The report said Sysco Central Illinois Inc. of Lincoln, Illinois, was the supplier of the statistically linked lettuce, olives and store-sliced tomatoes.

All victims were Illinois residents or out-of-state visitors who ate at one of 49 Subway stores in 28 Illinois counties. Twenty-eight people were hospitalized for stays ranging from one day to nine days.

The summary report on the outbreak that spawned a Subway Salmonella lawsuit also said that 12 Subway foodhandlers tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella. It is possible for the bacteria to be transmitted person to person when infected individuals don&apos;t properly wash their hands after going to the toilet. The report said the 12 infected foodhandlers worked at seven stores in seven different counties.

Besides the confirmed cases, Illinois health officials reported six probable cases and 89 suspected cases. Food safety lawyers from PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are representing victims of this outbreak and they continue to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Minnesota Salmonella Outbreak Study Rates Factors in Detecting Outbreaks 
 Posted on October 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Minnesota Salmonella Clusters investigated by the Minnesota Department of Health are solved as confirmed outbreaks more than 12 percent of the time -- a pattern that resulted in 43 confirmed outbreaks among 344 clusters studied from 2001-2007.   The results, determined in a study published last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concludes that public health officials should not wait to investigate Salmonella clusters if a cluster of more than 4 reported cases has been received. The study also found that the chances of solving outbreaks is greater when clusters are dense: At least 3 case isolates received within 7 days.   Specifically, during 2001–2007, a total of 43 of 344 clusters were solved by Minnesota health officials. Clusters of more than four isolates were more likely to be solved than clusters of 2 isolates. Clusters in which the first 3 case isolates were received at the Minnesota Department of Health within 7 days were more likely to be solved than were clusters in which the first 3 case isolates were received over a period of more than 14 days The first step in the investigations is to call infected people and run them through a detailed exposure questionnaire. Researchers compare answers looking for common exposures in order to arrive as suspect causes.   &quot;These results establish a benchmark for surveillance of Salmonella infections, and may provide a basis for investigating clusters of Salmonella cases for public health agencies with limited resources,&apos;&apos; the study said. The four authors, led by Joshua Rounds, are affiliated with the Minnesota Department of Health and the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. According to the research, the 6 most common Salmonella types in Minnesota during the study period were Typhimurium (25%); Enteritidis (20.5%); Newport (7.8%); Heidelberg (5.6%); Montevideo (3.0%); and Saintpaul (2.0%). The median number of Salmonella clusters per year was 50 and the median number of confirmed Salmonella outbreaks per year was 6.    Salmonellosis is a major foodborne illness that results in 1.4 million infections, 15,000 hospitalizations, and 400 deaths each year in the United States. Salmonella infections are primarily of foodborne origin but can also occur through contact with infected animals, humans, or their feces.   Food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., represents Salmonella victims in personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits to help them achieve financial compensation for pain and suffering, medical expenses and other harms.

 Salmonella Egg Farm on Notice From FDA 
 Posted on October 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
One of two Iowa egg producers implicated in the multi-state Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that sickened more than 1,600 people from May to September has been warned by the Food and Drug Administration to take&quot;prompt corrective action&apos;&apos; to clean up or face sanctions.

The actions against Quality Egg LLC of Galt, Iowa, could include, but are not limited to, seizure and/or injunction. Quality Egg is parent company of Wright County Egg.

 Salmonella lawsuit attorneys from PritzkerOlsen, P.A., observed some of the conditions cited in the FDA letter on a recent inspection tour and actually filmed live mice in the facilities. The firm has filed an egg lawsuit against Quality Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa in connection with the outbreak that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described as the largest Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak on record. If you or a loved one is a victim of this outbreak and need legal representation, call our office at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page. 

The FDA warning letter states:&quot;You should take prompt and aggressive actions to eliminate the Salmonella Enteritidis contamination and the observations described in this letter. Failure to take prompt corrective action may result in regulatory action being initiated by the Food and Drug Administration without further notice.&apos;&apos;

Quality Egg initially was tied to the outbreak when FDA laboratory analysis of feed samples at the company proved positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella. The FDA letter said the company&apos;s eggs are still being packed or held under insanitary conditions&quot;whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or... injurious to health.&apos;&apos;
 
 The letter states the company has failed to eliminate rodent harborages, wild birds in barns and pigeon roosts. The company also has failed to properly eliminate all sources of water in its manure pits and has failed to ensure that Salmonella is not introduced into or among poultry houses. Uncaged birds, for example, were using manure pits to access the egg laying areas and live maggots were observed. 
 
Meanwhile, the FDA is allowing Hillandale Farms of Iowa to start shipping shell eggs again after a successful followup to violations found at inspection. Hillandale was the other company implicated by federal health officials in the outbreak.

 Savoy Head Start Salmonella Investigation 
 Posted on October 17, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A possible Salmonella outbreak at Savoy Head Start in the Village of Savoy, Illinois, has prompted school officials to close the facility for cleaning and scouring. a school official told ABC Newschannel 15.

Preliminary investigation suggests a person-to-person Salmonella outbreak at Savoy Head Start, a preschool for children ages 3 to 5. The school official told the news station that children and staff have been ill. Who or where the bacteria came from remains unknown.

 Salmonella bacteria is especially threatening to children under 5 , the elderly and others who have underdeveloped or compromised immune systems. In person-to-person Salmonella outbreaks, transmission is fecal-oral, resulting when an infected person doesn&apos;t wash their hands properly after going to the toilet.  

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella  can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocardiditis or reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome ..

If you or a family member were sickened in this outbreak and have questions for a Salmonella lawyer, call PritzkerOlsen, P.A., (TOLL FREE) at 1-888-377-8900 or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Clearview Salmonella Football Dinner 
 Posted on October 15, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The focus of the Clearview Salmonella investigation is the football dinner served two weeks ago to the Clearview High School football team, Lorain County&apos;s chief public medical officer said.

 Lorain County General Health District Commissioner Kenneth G. Pearce told The Morning Journal newspaper of northern Ohio that investigators still can&apos;t say with certainty that the outbreak stemmed from the football dinner. But lab testing by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) has confirmed 8 cases of Salmonella B from individuals who attended the function. Lorain County General Health District sent 8 samples to ODH and all 8 were confirmed positive for Salmonella B. The investigation is ongoing.

Many other Clearview school children were out sick at the same time, but Pearce told the newspaper that many of those cases appeared to be upper respirartory illnesses, like strep throat. The Norwalk virus , or norovirus, has been discounted as a cause, he said.

 Salmonella outbreaks are caused when food is contaminated with the feces of infected animals or when infected food handlers fail to wash thoroughly after going to the toilet. Healthy adults normally recover from their gastro-intestinal illness with no treatment, but severe illness or death may be caused by Salmonella in young children, older adults and others with compromised immune systems. Salmonella poisoning is not to be taken lightly and can have long-term effects, including arthritis and arterial infections. 

Clearview families who have legal questions about this outbreak and Salmonella litigation to recover damages may call law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this web page. A Salmonella attorney at our firm will provide a free case consultation and explain what action is required.

 Clearview High School Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on October 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Clearview High School Salmonella outbreak questioned by many since 100 students called in sick has been confirmed through positive laboratory test results in all eight samples sent by Lorain County to the Ohio Department of Health.

Lorain County General Health District Health Commissioner Kenneth G. Pearce announced the positive Salmonella test results in an official statement. The samples were taken from eight individuals who attended a&quot;recent Clearview High School function.&apos;&apos; Pearce said the Clearview High School Salmonella investigation is ongoing. The Salmonella found in the victims was identified as Salmonella B. 

 Clearview High School is part of Clearview Local Schools in Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland on the shores of Lake Erie. Local station 19ActionNews.com reported that the outbreak stems from a dinner served to the Clearview High School football team.

As Lorain County and state health officials attempt to find a cause for the Salmonella outbreak, affected families may have legal questions about compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering. National Salmonella law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , will provide free case consultations at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page. 

 Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Salmonella is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne outbreaks in the United States; approximately half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings or events. In some cases, the bacteria is spread by infected food handlers while other times an outbreak is triggered by a specific food item contaminated with the pathogen.

Attorneys at Pritzker Olsen have years of experience representing victims of food poisoning, including Salmonella. We are one of the few law firms practicing extensively in foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for those sickened in outbreaks.

 Egg Lawsuit Attorneys Hire Poultry Expert to Help Inspect Egg Facilities 
 Posted on October 9, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Egg lawsuit attorneys Brendan Flaherty and Ryan Osterholm hired a poultry processing and products microbiology expert to accompany them in the inspection of the egg production facilities at Hillandale Farms in New Hampton, Iowa and Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa, on September 30 and October 5, respectively.   The two attorneys work for national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , which represents dozens of clients throughout the United States sickened in this outbreak. Flaherty said it was important for the firm to personally inspect the facilities and have its expert document the numerous food safety violations that the Food and Drug Administration found there. 
Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg facilities were at the center of a nationwide Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that started in May and continued through September. In August, the two Iowa egg producers recalled more than 500 million eggs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 1,600 illnesses have been documented and many more went unreported.

FDA inspectors found such unsanitary conditions as: live mice in chicken barns, numerous live and dead flies, manure piles up to eight feet high, uncaged hens tracking manure throughout the facilities and workers violating food safe practices. Last year, PritzkerOlsen also attended inspections of the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) facilities as part of their litigation in the 2008-2009 Salmonella peanut product outbreak. The firm represents the families of three victims who died in that outbreak--more than any law firm involved in the PCA litigation. That case recently settled for $12 million.
 
 &quot;Seeing firsthand the conditions that led to our clients&apos; illnesses allows us to prove their cases and see that they are compensated for the physical, emotional and financial hardships the contaminated eggs caused them,&apos;&apos; Flaherty said.

 FDA Says Salmonella Egg Outbreak Inspection Program Remains on Track 
 Posted on October 8, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Salmonella egg outbreak that has sickened at least 1,600 Americans since May has put an egg facility inspection program run by the Food and Drug Administration under a spotlight.

          The FDA&apos;s Deputy Commissioner for Foods, Michael Taylor said this week in a letter to the New York Times that the anti- Salmonella inspection program is on track.&quot;In response to the Salmonella outbreak that led to the recall of more than 500 million eggs, the agency will inspect all 600 of the nation’s largest egg producers by the end of 2011,&apos;&apos; Taylor said. These inspections have already begun, starting with facilities considered at highest risk because of past problems, he said.

The Times ran a story last week noting gaffes in the FDA&apos;s egg facility inspection training program. A top FDA egg expert broke a basic biosecurity rule by parking her van near a henhouse where she was giving a training session in Pennsylvania. It was called to her attention but she then repeated the act at another training session, where she became argumentative. The issue with vehicles is that they can track manure on roads too close to where eggs are laid.

The FDA confirmed to the Times that the person involved in the incidents was removed from the inspection program and that the program is on track. Said Taylor:&quot;The agency is committed to ensuring the safety of the nation&apos;s egg supply.&apos;&apos;
 
 Meanwhile, an egg class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of victims across the country. To contact an egg Salmonella lawyer, call national Salmonella law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Salmonella Oklahoma Investigators Keep Driving for Clues to Outbreak 
 Posted on October 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
In the coming week, public health investigators in Oklahoma will strive for answers in the Salmonella outbreak centered in Mustang Public Schools, located in the greater Oklahoma City area.

 So far, there has been no public guidance to identify sources or even possible sources to this outbreak, which has sickened 12 elementary-aged school children in four Mustang schools. Also previously confirmed were two adult cases in Oklahoma County, including one person hospitalized. Carter County has a young adult with a confirmed case of Salmonella. 

 

Oklahoma Health Department&apos;s Communicable Disease Division Director is Laurence Burnsed. He told The Oklahoman newspaper that the source of the outbreak could be food that is widely distributed to several areas of the state, but there&apos;s not enough information yet to suggest a food that people should avoid. The state also will be looking at scattered Salmonella cases in Iowa and Nebraska that may be related.
 
Meanwhile, Mustang school parents received a letter from the school district saying that the school is working diligently with the state health department to determine the origin of the cases.&quot; Salmonellosis is not necessarily related to food preparation,&apos;&apos; a school district official wrote to parents.
 
 Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , has begun its own investigation into the outbreak and a Salmonella attorney at the firm is handling case calls from victims of this outbreak at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE).

 Egg Salmonella Lawsuit Going Forward 
 Posted on October 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
An egg Salmonella lawsuit against Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa is going forward with the addition of evidence collected in the past week during on-site inspections of these facilities by attorneys from PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , a national food safety law firm.

PritzkerOlsen represents victims in the nationwide egg Salmonella outbreak and is continuing to accept cases from a group of more than 1,600 people sickened since May from contaminated shell eggs. The law firm&apos;s egg Salmonella claims center has information on contacting an attorney for a free consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE).

 Investigators from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also inspected multiple facilities of Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. At Wright County Egg, officials found chicken manure reaching eight feet high, employees who did not wear or change protective clothing when moving from one laying house to another, and many live mice throughout the facilities. Inspectors also observed wild birds sitting near and flying over grain bins that contained chicken feed. In total, six samples taken from the facilities and feed supply tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis 
 At Hillandale Farms, FDA inspections found numerous unsealed rodent holes, liquid manure“streaming”from a crack in the manure pit, and uncaged hens tracking manure throughout the laying facilities. FDA found Salmonella Enteritidis in a sample of spent water from an egg wash station.    FDA’s inspectional observations, in addition to sample results, indicate substantial potential for Salmonella to have persisted in the environment and to have contaminated eggs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded. The findings indicate that Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa are the likely sources of the contaminated shell eggs.    A person infected with Salmonella Enteritidis usually has fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming a contaminated food or beverage. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without antibiotic treatment. However, the diarrhea can be severe, and hospitalization may be required. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems may have a more serious illness. In these patients, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

 Oklahoma Salmonella Outbreak Expands 
 Posted on October 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A growing Oklahoma Salmonella outbreak has drawn the interest of public health investigators, including epidemiologists in Iowa and Nebraska. The outbreak is centered in the Mustang School District in Oklahoma&apos;s Canadian County, where 12 elemetary-aged children at four schools have been infected with the same strain of Salmonella.  Three adults outside Canadian County also are considered part of the outbreak, including one person hospitalized. 

According to a front-page story about the outbreak in The Oklahoman newspaper, the communicable disease division director for the Oklahoma Health Department says work is still being conducted to determine the cause of the outbreak. &quot;It&apos;s still too early in the investigation,&apos;&apos; said the director, Laurence Burnsed. Mr. Burnsed confirmed to the newsapaper that Oklahoma is monitoring the outbreak of a similar strain of  Salmonella identified in Iowa and Nebraska. Those states are just reporting a couple of cases so far, he said.

 In a letter to Mustang school parents, Deputy Superintendent Belinda Rogers said this week that the Salmonella outbreak is not necessarily related to food preparation, but no one has drawn conclusions yet about what is causing school children to get sick. 
 
 A person infected with Salmonella  usually has fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming a contaminated food or beverage or coming into contact with the bacteria though other means, such as physical contact with the feces of infected animals or people. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without antibiotic treatment. However, the diarrhea can be severe, and hospitalization may be required. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems may have a more serious illness. In these patients, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. One of the long-term health risks of Salmonella infection includes reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome . About 10 percent of people with Reiter&apos;s Syndrome develop heart problems. 
 
Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., has years of experience representing victims of Salmonella and other foodborne illnesses. The firm is conducting its own investigation of the Oklahoma Salmonella outbreak and is providing free case consultations to families whose loved ones have been sickened. Our firm is currently litigating a Salmonella lawsuit and has represented scores of food poisoning victims over the years, collecting millions of dollars in damages for them.

PritzkerOlsen also is actively involved in various efforts to reduce the threat of foodborne illness in the United States, including calling for tougher food safety laws and enforcement.

 Mustang School Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on September 30, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
An Oklahoma school Salmonella outbreak is under investigation by the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Mustang Public Schools in Canadian County.

 The Mustang school Salmonella outbreak among elementary-aged children was confirmed by Mustang Public Schools Deputy Superintendent Belinda Rogers in a letter to parents that went out this week. The parents were told that officials from the state health department would likely be interviewing them as part of a study to find the cause of the outbreak. KOCO.com reported that the outbreak has sickened at least 10 children in Mustang, two adults in Oklahoma County and a third adult in Carter County.

KOCO.com quoted a state health official as saying the cases appeared to have started between September 2 and September 13. The state official said the cases involved children at Centennial, Lakehoma, Mustang Valley elementary schools and the city&apos;s pre-Kindergarten school. 
 
&quot; Salmonella begins with a contaminated product, and we are working diligently with the State Department of Health officials to determine the origin of the cases,&apos;&apos; Deputy Superintendent Rogers said in her letter to parents. 
 
Even though healthy adults often endure Salmonella infections without seeking medical attention, parents are reminded that the pathogen is capable of causing serious illness and death. Children under the age of 5, older adults and other people who have weakened immune systems are most at risk.

If you or a child in your family has been a victim in this Salmonella outbreak , call PritzkerOlsen, P.A., for answers to legal questions about compensation and to receive a free case consultation.

 Egg Lawsuit Attorneys To Inspect Farms 
 Posted on September 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Egg lawsuit attorneys from PritzkerOlsen, P.A., will inspect the facilities of Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms this week to bolster Salmonella egg litigation on behalf of outbreak victims nationwide. The lawyers’on-site investigation comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found a shocking list of unsafe conditions including uncaged hens on overflowing piles of manure.
 Attorneys Brendan Flaherty and Ryan Osterholm, along with poultry processing and products microbiology professor Dr. Scott Russell, will tour Hillandale Farms in New Hampton, Iowa on September 30 and Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa, on October 5. Both attorneys will be available for media interviews before and after the inspections.   Flaherty says the purpose of the inspection is to document and allow the firm&apos;s experts to analyze what went wrong. Another part of the mission is to find out whether anything was covered up or altered. Flaherty explains that the owners are under a duty to preserve the conditions which led to over 1,600 outbreak cases of Salmonella Enteritidis .    PritzkerOlsen has been contacted by hundreds of people affected by the egg Salmonella outbreak and is continuing to accept cases from those who have been sickened. The outbreak began in May, peaked in July and has continued into September, spawning an egg class action lawsuit. PritzkerOlsen filed the first egg lawsuit in Minnesota on behalf of a woman sickened in June from a restaurant outbreak traced by state health investigators to Hillandale Farms.   Pritzker Olsen also represents the families of three who died in the Peanut Corporation of America Salmonella outbreak in 2009. Recent congressional hearings have unearthed that PCA and Wright County Egg used AIB, the same auditing firm, to rate their food safety practices.   For free case consultations, egg lawsuit lawyers at PritzkerOlsen can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 As Egg Claims Are Made FDA Evaluates Farms for Sanctions 
 Posted on September 23, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
As Salmonella litigation proceeds in the egg outbreak associated with two Iowa egg farms, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reviewing the findings of its investigation to evaluate what enforcement actions may be appropriate.

 That statement from FDA Deputy Commissioner Joshua Sharfstein was made Wednesday in Washington, D.C., at a Congressional hearing on Salmonella in eggs . According to a transcript of the proceedings, Sharfstein said the agency found serious problems with pest control and manure handling when inspectors went to facilities operated by the DeCoster family. Those problems could have contributed to the spread of Salmonella , Sharfstein told the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

Although the DeCosters identified contaminated feed as a likely culprit for the outbreak, Sharfstein said the FDA wasn&apos;t ready to point to a single source for the problem.
 &quot;We believe there are multiple potential sources of Salmonella  Enteritidis on these farms,&quot;Sharfstein said.   Sharfstein urged the passage of the food safety bill that would give FDA additional authority to recall tainted products and require more inspections of food-processing facilities. According to Sharfstein, shell eggs from Wright County Egg were sold to distributors and wholesalers in 22 states, who then distributed the shell eggs further throughout the country and to Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.   Federal authorities have said more than 1,600 confirmed cases of Salmonella Enteriditis diagnosed since May 1 likely were caused by contaminated eggs from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa.   Salmonella egg victims are being represented by PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , a national food safety law firm that has established a Salmonella claim center for those who have been sickened. Salmonella egg lawyers for the firm are available for a free case consultation through the claim center or by calling direct at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE). Our firm over the years has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning, including Salmonella Enteritidis in eggs.

 Salmonella Egg Hearing Highlighted by Chairman&apos;s Blistering Remarks 
 Posted on September 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Salmonella egg hearing in Washington opened Wednesday with a powerful statement of disdain against operations at Wright County Egg, the Iowa farm at the center of a Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that has sickened more than 1,600 people nationwide.

The admonishment came from Representative Henry Waxman, D-California, chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.

 Waxman said the DeCoster family who owns Wright County Egg and raised eggs for Hillandale Farms in Iowa has known about safety problems at its facilities for decades, yet they continue to persist. Over 30 years ago, eggs from a farm operated by the DeCoster family killed nine people and sickened 500 in New York, Waxman said. Twenty years ago, Maryland ordered the DeCosters to stop selling eggs in the state because of the contamination problems.
 And as Waxman&apos;s Committee revealed last week, environmental samples at DeCoster facilities over the last three years tested positive dozens of times for potential contamination by a dangerous form of Salmonella before the current outbreak erupted in May 2010. Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., has filed an egg lawsuit against Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms and it continues to accept new cases for egg litigation in various states. To contact a lawyer, go to the firm&apos;s online Salmonella claims center .  According to a transcript of the chairman&apos;s remarks:&quot;Despite these warnings, the DeCoster facilities were operated with a shocking level of disregard for basic food safety controls.&apos;&apos; Conditions were so bad in one facility that the wall of the barn was bursting open because of excessive manure, he said.   &quot;DeCoster farms have had warning after warning. Yet they continue to raise chickens in slovenly conditions–and to make millions by selling contaminated eggs,&apos;&apos; Chairman Waxman said in his opening remarks at the hearing.   To demonstrate that the risks are real, Waxman&apos;s committee took testimony from two witnesses: Ms. Sarah Lewis and Ms. Carol Lobato. Ms. Lewis ate contaminated eggs while celebrating her sister’s college graduation, and Ms. Lobato was sickened when she went out to dinner with her grandson. They were both hospitalized and gravely ill.   &quot;I commend Ms. Lewis and Ms. Lobato for their courage in speaking out today. Unfortunately, their horrific experiences were shared by many others. The eggs that are the subject of today’s hearing sickened over 1,600 people in 11 states,&apos;&apos; Waxman said.     Tags: Egg Class Action , Egg Lawsuit , Salmonella MN attorney , egg hearing , egg litigation

 Posted on September 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
PritzkerOlsen, P.A., one of the country&apos;s leading law firms in foodborne illness litigation, has launched a new Salmonella egg website for consumers and victims.

 Salmonella Egg Outbreak Will be Aired Before Congressional Committee 
 Posted on September 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Congressional hearing entitled&quot;The Outbreak of Salmonella in Eggs&apos;&apos; is scheduled to begin at noon Wednesday in Washington, D.C. before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 

 The latest agenda for the meeting notes that two of the five scheduled witnesses are victims of the   Salmonella Enteritidis  outbreak. Those victims are Sarah Lewis and Carol Lobato. According to the committee&apos;s briefing memo, the hearing at 12:00 p.m. in room 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building will examine the recent Salmonella outbreak associated with shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa. The hearing continues the Subcommittee’s investigative activities concerning the adequacy of efforts to ensure the safety and security of the nation’s food supply. 

The hearing follows a massive egg recall in August by Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, and Hillandale Farms of Iowa. State and federal health investigators have associated more than 1,600 cases of Salmonella Enteritidis with contaminated eggs from those two farms. Wednesday&apos;s hearing calls for testimony from top executives of both companies, including Wright County Egg founder Austin&quot;Jack&quot;DeCoster. Media reports indicate DeCoster will apologize.

His egg operations have drawn scrutiny from regulators in the past and the committee has documentation of previous problems with Salmonella at Wright County Egg.

The nationwide outbreak has prompted an egg class action lawsuit and a Minnesota egg lawsuit filed by PritzkerOlsen, P.A . Fred Pritzker, president of the national Salmonella law firm, is having the egg farms inspected next week and is continuing to accept cases from those who have suffered Salmonella infections in the outbreak.

 Egg Salmonella Information Sought by Congress For Committee&apos;s Investigation 
 Posted on September 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A pair of powerful congressman want egg Salmonella information straight from Austin&quot;Jack&apos;&apos; DeCoster, the owner of the Iowa egg company that federal investigators have associated with a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis.

DeCoster was mailed a letter Tuesday from Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Bart Stupak of Michigan, leaders of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. They have invited DeCoster and the president of Hillandale Farms of Iowa to provide egg Salmonella information to the committee at a public hearing next week. The letter indicates that Wright County Egg tested positive for Salmonella hundreds of times in the past two years.
 &quot;When you testify before the committee, we ask that you come prepared to explain why your facilities tested potentially positive for Salmonella Enteritidis contamination on so many occasions, what steps you took to address the contamination identified in these test results, and whether you shared these results with FDA or other federal or state food safety officials,&quot;Waxman and Stupak wrote. 
The letter to DeCoster indicated that environmental sample reports between 2008 and 2010 found 426 positive results for Salmonella , including 73 samples that were potentially positive for Salmonella Enteritidis, the same strain that has sickened more than 1,500 people across the country.

The outbreak started in May, peaked in July and has continued into September. The recall of 550 million eggs by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms happened in mid-August. Meanwhile, victims of the outbreak are continuing to contact law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., for egg litigation and compensation for medical expense, lost wages, travel, pain and other harms.

Our firm filed an egg lawsuit late last month in Minnesota on behalf of a woman who was sickened in the Mi Rancho restaurant outbreak in Bemidji. State officials traced the outbreak to eggs from Hillandale Farms. More lawsuits are being prepared for PritzkerOlsen&apos;s egg Salmonella clients in other states.

Free case consultations can be obtained by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page or by calling a Salmonella egg recall lawyer at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE).

 Contacts Continue for Egg Recall Lawyer 
 Posted on September 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
One month after Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, announced its initial recall of shell eggs , law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , is continuing to get contacts from people sickened by the outbreak strain of Salmonell a Enteritidis.
 The food safety law firm represents Salmonella egg outbreak victims whose illnesses date as far back as June. Founder and president Fred Pritzker , who is lead attorney for the firm’s egg recall cases, already has filed an egg lawsuit in Minnesota and is working on additional egg lawsuits for other clients from across the country. The Minnesota case stemmed from a cluster of illnesses among patrons of the same restaurant, Mi Rancho in Bemidji, Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Health traced it back to contaminated eggs from Hillandale Farms, also of Iowa.   Across the country, more than 1,500 individuals have suffered Salmonella Enteritidis infections that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has attributed to contaminated shell eggs from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. According to CDC, the outbreak started in May, peaked in July and has continued into September.   Pritzker said the heavy volume of contacts from victims has prompted his firm to conduct its own investigation and he is hoping for court permission to inspect the egg farms as soon as possible. FDA inspection reports found unsanitary conditions and multiple violations of food safety laws.  “We’re getting complaints like crazy,’’Pritzker said.“People are scared and angry because this outbreak should not have happened.’’   A person infected with Salmonella Enteritidis usually has fever, painful cramps and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming contaminated food.

 Posted on September 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw The top executives of the egg recall have been invited to testify before Congress at a hearing entitled&quot;The Outbreak of Salmonella in Eggs&apos;&apos; on Tuesday, September 21.   The invited witnesses before Chairman Henry Waxman&apos;s committee are Austin&quot;Jack&quot;DeCoster, owner of Wright County Egg; Orland Bethel, president of Hillandale Farms of Iowa and Michael R. Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   The Des Moines Register reported that DeCoster, whose company is responsible for most of the 550 million eggs recalled in August, will indeed testimony. That wasn&apos;t the case in 2009 when Stewart Parnell, then head of Peanut Corp. of America, pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify before the same committee about the peanut product Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak that killed nine people and sickened more than 700.   Chairman Waxman, of California, has scheduled next week&apos;s hearing at 11 a.m. in room 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building to discuss a broad, multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis that has sickened more than 1,500 people.

 USDA Inspectors at Wright County Egg Failed to Report Unsanitary Conditions to the FDA 
 Posted on September 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 USDA egg graders were at Wright County Egg facilities (the egg recall company) and wrote daily sanitation reports. Reporters at the Wall Street Journal went through these reports and discovered that, as conditions at egg plant packing facilities became unsatisfactory, the USDA workers did not report the problems to the FDA, the regulatory body for food safety issues in commercial egg production. 

This is disturbing, but what is even more disturbing is the following quote from the Wall Street Journal article:
 
The USDA said it didn&apos;t give notice because&quot;the conditions at the egg plant packing facilities were routine.&quot;
 
Does this mean that bugs, overflowing trash, and egg residue on equipment that can cross contaminate is routine for the egg industry or just Wright County Egg?

I, for one, would be willing to pay more for eggs if I could get a guarantee that the hen house, egg packing plant and all facilities were clean. I might even pay more for eggs if I just could be assured that manure was not allowed to pile up and that dead chickens, mice and bugs were promptly removed, something that was not being done at Wright County Egg, according to the August FDA inspection report and an article in the Des Moines Register .

For the 1500-plus people who were sickened in the egg Salmonella outbreak , there was no guarantee of cleanliness. Instead, they ate eggs produced by a company that let manure piles rise to 8 feet.  Contact our law firm for egg lawsuit information.

 Egg Salmonella Outbreak Updates From CDC 
 Posted on September 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Egg Salmonella outbreak information has been updated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the egg recall and salmonella outbreak associated with Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms.

The latest highlights from the CDC ongoing investigation include:
 
&quot;From May 1 to August 31, 2010, approximately 1,519 illnesses were reported that are likely to be associated with this outbreak. FDA identified Salmonella with PFGE patterns indistinguishable from the outbreak strain in egg farm environmental samples.&quot;
 
The CDC advises consumers NOT to consume recalled eggs, which could still be in grocery stores, restaurants and refrigerators in homes. People who have these eggs should throw them away. A searchable database of recalled egg products is available to consumers.

Egg Salmonella Outbreak Timeline

 

 

Part of the way health officials determine whether patients are part of an outbreak is by analyzing the timeline of illnesses. This includes the following steps:

 Incubation time: the time it takes for symptoms to show after consuming the tainted food. This is typically 1-3 days for Salmonella Time to contact health care provider: how long it takes a patient to contact a doctor after experiencing their first symptoms. Time to diagnosis: The time it takes to get test results back from a patient to confirm that he or she is, in fact, sick with salmonella. Sample shipping time: the time it takes to ship the salmonella sample to the state public health authorities that will perform“DNA fingerprinting”. Time to serotyping and DNA fingerprinting

 Connecticut Salmonella Outbreak Stemmed from Potato Salad at Reception 
 Posted on September 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Based on investigation of a Connecticut Salmonella reception outbreak in September 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has written that multiple types of Salmonella might be involved in more outbreaks than generally realized.

Two types of Salmonella were identified in the public health probe of the Connecticut reception one year ago that sickened at least nine attendees:  Salmonella enterica serovar Schwarzengrund and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium variant O:5. The investigation by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) identified potato salad as the likely cause. 

 Lab cultures found co-infection in one attendee and one food service worker who was not showing Salmonella symptoms of illness at the time of the reception somewhere in Connecticut -- the study doesn&apos;t say where. Attendees at the reception ate from a self-service buffet, but workers who prepared the buffet were observed to have bare-handed contact with ready-to-eat food and did not practice adequate hand washing.

Potato salad consumption at this Connecticut reception was strongly associated with illness and the food was prepared by a local restaurant -- not in someone&apos;s home kitchen. The CDC said in its report on the two-type Salmonella outbreak that knowledge of all Salmonella serotypes involved in an outbreak might help implicate the outbreak source, define the scope of the outbreak, and determine the selection of appropriate control measures.

People sickened in this restaurant-catered reception may still be eligible to join a Salmonella lawsuit against the purveyor. Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , is conducting its own investigation into the outbreak and is accepting cases at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE).

 Wright County Egg Workers Describe Unsanitary Conditions in the Hen Houses 
 Posted on September 9, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Past and present workers at Wright County Egg in Iowa , home of the chickens who laid the Salmonella eggs, dished out some dirt on the company to the Des Moines Register . Here are some quotes from the article about the conditions in the Wright County Egg hen houses:
 
Dozens of chickens died daily, their bodies lying undiscovered in cages for days, and perhaps weeks, at a time.

“I saw maggots and sometimes mice on the conveyor belt.”

Hundreds of mice killed by poison can fill about 50 cage traps in each hen house several times a week.

A wry smile broke across her face as she recalled the multitude of mice that dodged her feet when she walked between rows of chicken cages.

Every worker interviewed said the piles of manure under the hen houses are cleaned out once a year.

The ammonia caused bloodshot and swollen eyes, and made nasal passages throb.

A Mexican woman who declined to be identifiedsaid she quit in January and worked there four years. She said the ammonia grew worse in the winter because the vents were closed to keep the hen houses warm.

She called the conditions inside the hen houses&quot;incredible.&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t understand how the government allowed them to operate like this,&quot;she said through an interpreter.
 
The manure problem was highlighted in an FDA inspection report of Wright County Egg facilities issued in August after Wright County Egg recalled over 300 million eggs and over 1000 people reported getting Salmonella poisoning. According to the report, manure was piled 8 feet high, and two hen house entrance doors were blocked with excessive amounts of manure.

Justice requires that Wright County Egg and its owner, Jack DeCoster, be held accountable for the illnesses caused by the contaminated eggs. Our law firm has filed a lawsuit against Wright County Egg seeking payment of medical expenses and compensation for pain and suffering and other damages.  Contact our law firm for egg lawsuit information.

 Egg Recall List Update 
 Posted on September 9, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
I just got back from a convenience store to buy eggs. When I asked the cashier about the egg recall, there was a blank stare. Another woman looked at me and said,&quot;I am going to watch football. The eggs come from somewhere.&quot; I appreciated the concern and knew neither of them had ever had Salmonella or probably any illness with severe barfing and diarrhea. 

I got home and checked my eggs with the egg recall list. My eggs are not on the list but I can&apos;t assume they are Salmonella-free. 

Here is the updated egg recall list:

 Mi Rancho Salmonella Egg Outbreak Victims Include Man from Clearwater 
 Posted on September 8, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A state health official told the St. Cloud Times newspaper that a man from Clearwater, Minnesota, was among the seven people sickened in the Mi Rancho Restaurant Salmonella egg outbreak that helped investigators trace the problem to Hillandale Farms of Iowa.

 The Clearwater man was not mentioned by name, but Minnesota Health Department spokesman Josh Rounds said the man was one of seven who became infected with  Salmonella Enteritidis after eating at Mi Rancho restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota. The Mi Rancho Salmonella egg outbreak was the first of three clusters of Salmonella Enteritidis in Minnesota, Rounds said. The others were in St. Paul and Rochester.

A Mi Rancho lawsuit was filed late last month in Bemidji by law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A .. The suit seeks more than $100,000 for Robin and Kenneth Shaffer of Mantorville. Like the man from Clearwater, Robin was one of the seven confirmed Mi Rancho Salmonella victims. The egg lawsuit seeks compensation from Mi Rancho and two egg suppliers in Iowa at the center of the multi-state Salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 1,460 people across the country.
 
 PritzkerOlsen represents victims in the Mi Rancho outbreak and others sickened by Salmonella Enteritidis in eggs . More egg litigation is pending and the firm is continuing to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page. Fred Pritzker, the lead attorney handling egg cases, has been pressing to get investigators into facilities at Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms to advance the firm&apos;s own probe of the outbreak.
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said state investigations in Minnesota, Colorado and California helped associate a four-fold increase in Salmonella Enteritidis cases this year to contamination at Wright County Egg, Hillandale Farms and additional companies like Sparboe Farms of Litchfield, Minnesota, that repackaged eggs from those suppliers.

 Egg Recall Product List Updated by FDA 
 Posted on September 7, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The egg recall product list has been updated by the Food and Drug Administration to aid consumers search egg brands recalled in the multi-state Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak associated with eggs recalled by Iowa&apos;s Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms.

 The latest egg recall list by FDA contains 46 egg brands that may be contaminated with Salmonella. Already this outbreak has   caused more than 1,460 illnesses across the country as stated by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest egg recall list is searchable and provides plant codes and Julian dates for affected cartons.

While the recall list focuses on retail shell eggs, many of the contaminated eggs produced in Iowa were sold through foodservice channels for use in restaurants and other commercial kitchens. In fact, clusters of illnesses from restaurant outbreaks and catered social events led to the discovery that tainted eggs were the cause of a four-fold increase nationally in the number of Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses.

 PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , represents many Salmonella egg victims and has filed an egg lawsuit on behalf of Robin and Kenneth Shaffer of Mantorville, Minnesota. Robin was one of seven people sickened in an outbreak at Mi Rancho Restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota, and the public health investigation traced the problem to Hillandale Farms. The lawsuit seeks more than $100,000 in compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering and other harms. 

 National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen is conducting its own investigation of the Salmonella egg outbreak and is continuing to accept additional cases . If you or a loved one has been sickened by Salmonell a from contaminated shell eggs, call 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page for a free case consulation.

 Minnesota Egg Lawyer in the News 
 Posted on September 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
News coverage of a Minnesota egg lawsuit has put national food safety attorney Fred Pritzker in the headlines as more Americans try to grasp the importance of a Salmonella egg outbreak associated with more than 1,460 illnesses across the country.

 Minnesota egg lawyer  Fred Pritzker has been featured in recent stories by the Star Tribune newspaper, NBC-TV affiliate KARE11 and United Press International for coverage of the egg lawsuit he recently filed in Beltrami County on behalf of Robin and Kenneth Shaffer of Mantorville, Minnesota.

Robin contracted Salmonellosis from egg ingredients she consumed at Mi Rancho Restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota. Her case and the illnesses of six other Mi Rancho customers led to a Minnesota Department of Health investigation that traced the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis to Hillandale Farms of Iowa.

The finding led to the expansion of a massive egg recall started by Wright County Egg, also of Iowa. Together, the two firms have recalled more than half a billion eggs and have been associated with the largest Salmonella outbreak in the United States since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began surveillance in the 1970s.
 
 Attorney Pritzker told KARE11 that he is also working on egg lawsuits for 20 to 25 other clients from across the country. He said he is hoping to get court permission to have his own experts begin inspections of the egg farms&quot;as soon as possible.&quot;. 
 
Robin Shaffer, who missed six days of work during her illness, has said that her bout with Salmonella affects her to this day.&quot;I&apos;m scared to eat. I&apos;m scared to buy food. I&apos;m scared to go out to eat. I&apos;m scared for my family every time I fix food. And I&apos;m angry. This didn&apos;t have to happen,&apos;&apos; she told the television station.

In the Star Tribune, food industry reporter Mike Hughlett has led strong coverage of egg litigation and the investigations of the Iowa mega-farms. He noted that Pritzker&apos;s egg lawsuit not only names Mi Rancho as a respondent, but also Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg.
 
 Said Pritzker to the Star Tribune:&quot;We&apos;re getting complaints like crazy&apos;&apos; from people sickened by contaminated eggs.

 Don Perico Salmonella Restaurant Closing 
 Posted on September 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella traced to Don Perico Restaurant in Bakersfield, California, prompted health officials to close the establishment as a temporary measure to protect public health, investigators said.

 Kern County Environmental Health Division took the action late in the week after confirming four Salmonella infections are likely associated with consumption of food served at Don Perico&apos;s Bakersfield restaurant at 4701 White Lane. 

 The county said two of the infected people were hospitalized. Investigators considered the possibility that the outbreak is associated with the current multi-state Salmonella egg outbreak, which has hit California hard. But the county&apos;s press release said there is no evidence that this outbreak is associated with the egg recall by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms.
 
 &quot;The restaurant will remain closed until the investigation is complete and we are confident this facility is able to safely serve food,&apos;&apos; said a press release from Matt Constantine, director of health services for the County of Kern, CA. On Sunday, the restaurant&apos;s telephone number was&quot;temporarily out of service.&apos;&apos; 
 
 Salmonella infection can be a serious health threat, especially for young children, older adults and others who have a compromised immune system. Symptoms normally develop 12 to 72 hours after exposure and may include diarrhea, fever, vomiting and abdominal cramps.

If you or a loved one are victims of the Don Perico Salmonella restaurant outbreak, your questions about legal compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and other harms will be answered promptly by a Salmonella restaurant lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 CA Salmonella Egg Outbreak Update 
 Posted on September 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Salmonella egg outbreak in California has sickened more than 200 people, including 42 confirmed illnesses in Santa Clara County.

The Santa Clara County Public Health Department issued an update on the outbreak this week, saying that six of the 42 confirmed victims in that county were hospitalized with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis. 

 As federal health officials have noted, public health investigations in California, Colorado and Minnesota were instrumental in tracking a four-fold rise in Salmonella Enteritidis illness this spring and summer to contaminated eggs sold by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, both of Iowa. The two producers have recalled more than half a billion eggs
 The Santa Clara County Public Health Department said it has participated in the joint state and federal investigation by interviewing case patients, reviewing their exposures, and collaborating with the California Department of Environmental Health and others to understand the extent of the outbreak and the source of the infections.   As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to investigate this outbreak, which has sickened more than 1,400 Americans, law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , is continuing to accept cases from victims across the country. Our law firm is a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation and we have filed one of the first egg lawsuits in the country.   For a free case consultation with a Salmonella egg recall lawyer, call PritzkerOlsen at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Egg Lawsuit Investigation Continuing 
 Posted on September 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Egg lawsuit investigations by PritzkerOlsen, P.A., are continuing as more restaurant outbreaks and clusters of Salmonella Enteritidis  are being identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

According to the latest CDC update on the Salmonella egg outbreak, public health investigations in 10 states since April have identified 29 restaurants or event clusters where more than one ill person with the outbreak strain has eaten. Data from these investigations suggest that shell eggs are a likely source of infections in many of these restaurants or event clusters. Wright County Egg, in Galt, Iowa, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 29 restaurants or event clusters, CDC said. Three are clusters that have been recently reported, but occurred earlier in the outbreak, the CDC said. Traceback investigations are ongoing. 

 Fred Pritzer , founder and president of PritzkerOlsen, filed one of the first egg lawsuits in the country on behalf of a Minnesota woman and her husband after the woman suffered a painful Salmonella infection traced by the Minnesota Department of Health to contaminated eggs at Hillandale Farms of Iowa. She was one of six people sickened in a Salmonella outbreak at Mi Rancho restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota.

The firm represents many other victims and is continuing to accept additional cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page. According to the CDC there are approximately 1,469 reported illnesses that are likely to be associated with this outbreak.
 
 Individuals who think they might have become ill from eating recalled eggs should consult their health care providers and request a stool culture. For answers to legal questions about egg recall compensation, contact a Salmonella egg lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, a leading national practitioner of foodborne illness litigation. 
 
In this egg Salmonella outbreak, investigation by the CDC, FDA, USDA and state health agencies in Minnesota, Colorado and California indicate substantial potential for Salmonella to have persisted in the environment and to have contaminated eggs at Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. Together, the two companies distributed more than half a billion eggs since May that may have been contaminated with Salmonella.

 Judge Orders Distribution of $12 Million Peanut Corporation of America Bankruptcy Fund 
 Posted on September 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national Salmonella litigation law firm, obtained a settlement for several victims of the Salmonella outbreak linked to Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) peanuts and three families who lost loved ones in the outbreak. The firm represented the families of more people killed in the PCA outbreak than any other law firm in the United States.

Shortly after being linked to the outbreak, PCA filed for bankruptcy, along with its subsidiaries, Plainview Peanut Co. LLC and Tidewater Blanching Co. LLC..
 
In October of 2009, a $12 million fund to pay victims of the Peanut Corp. of America Salmonella outbreak was established by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge William E. Anderson. At the time, there were 175 claims for illnesses.  Attorney Fred Pritzker was one of a handful of attorneys representing victims and their families.
 
Yesterday, Norman K. Moon, United States District Judge in the Western District of Virginia, approved settlement amounts&quot;in their entirety&quot;for the surviving victims and the families of those that died and ordered the bankruptcy trustee to make distributions.

 Egg Recall Investigation Finds Chicken Manure Piled High 
 Posted on September 1, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The August inspection report of Quality Egg LLC (doing business as Wright County Egg) provides a clue to how over 500 million eggs could have to be recalled due to possible contamination with Salmonella Enteritidis. Manure was 8 feet high in one area, and a door was&quot;blocked with excessive amounts of manure.&quot; Feel like eating an omelet?

Below is part of the investigation report ( click here for full report ):
 
You [Quality Egg LLC, d.b.a. Wright County Egg] failed to take steps to ensure there is no introduction or transfer of SE [ Salmonella Enteritidis ] into or among poultry houses. This was evidenced by the following observations:

Specifically,

a) There was only one entry doorway to access egg laying areas located at every other house. Entrances for houses on Layer I and Layer 2 were located on even numbered houses. Entrances for houses on Layer 3 and Layer 4 were located on odd numbered houses. For example, at Layer 3 and Layer 4—House 1 had a doorway and this same doorway had to be used to gain entrance to House 2.

b) Employees working within the houses did not wear or change protective clothing when moving from house to house. An employee at Layer 6 -House 3 was observed walking out of House 3 with a metal scraper and into House 2 without changing protective clothing and without cleaning/sanitizing equipment between the houses.

c) Un-caged birds (chickens having escaped) were observed in the egg laying operation in contact with the egg laying birds at Layer 3—Houses 9 and 16. The uncaged birds were using the manure, which was approximately 8 feet high, to access the egg laying area.

d) Layer 3–House 11, the house entrance door to access both House 11 and 12 was blocked with excessive amounts of manure in the manure pits.

 Peanut Butter Salmonella Cases Settled 
 Posted on September 1, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A $12 million Salmonella lawsuit settlement for victims of the massive peanut product outbreak that sickened more than 700 people and killed nine has been approved by a federal judge in Lynchburg, Virginia.

 PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , represented the families of more people killed in the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) outbreak than any other law firm in the United States.The money provided by the bankrupt company&apos;s insurer, Hartford Casualty Insurance Co., will be distributed based on the extent of victims&apos; illnesses. Additional settlement funds are being paid by Kellogg Co., which unknowingly used contaminated peanut butter supplied by PCA in some of its products.

 The ruling from U.S. District Judge Norman Moon will pay more than 120 wrongful death and personal injury claims related to the outbreak, which occurred in late 2008 and 2009.

 Fred Pritzker, founder and president of PritzkerOlsen, represented the families of three women who died. Two of the victims were from Minnesota and the third was from Ohio. Members of all three families went on to speak out passionately on the national stage for change in America&apos;s food safety system.

As part of PritzkerOlsen&apos;s investigation into the PCA Salmonella peanut outbreak, Pritzker traveled to the Blakely, Georgia, PCA plant implicated in the outbreak and personally inspected it. What he found was appalling: filthy equipment, vermin and gaps in walls and the ceiling that allowed in any number of rodents, insects and other disease carrying animals.

 Pritzker has said he sees similarities between the PCA outbreak and the ongoing Salmonella egg investigation of two Iowa egg producers -- Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. Inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration have found egregious food safety violations at both establishments. Federal authorities have associated more than 1,400 illnesses in multiple states with contaminated eggs from the companies.

 In the S almonella Enteritidis egg outbreak, PritzkerOlsen already has filed one egg lawsuit and represents a growing number of other victims. The firm is continuing to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE) or contact an egg recall lawyer at the firm by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Egg Lawsuits Filed Based on Microbiological and Epidemiological Evidence 
 Posted on September 1, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 We just filed suit on behalf of two of our Salmonella egg outbreak clients. These are the first Minnesota outbreak cases in litigation and some of the earliest cases filed in the United States. Here is a link to the Salmonella eggs suit papers .

Proving a case of salmonella poisoning (or any other foodborne illness) requires facts establishing a microbiological and epidemiologic link between the victim’s illness and the food product produced and/or served by the wrongdoers. It also involves identifying the wrongful conduct that caused the food product to become poisoned in the first place. This process is discussed in more detail in an interesting article entitled“ How Lawyers Prove Foodborne Illness .”

Despite the science and technology involved in proving these cases, we often hear from people who blame us for suing wrongdoers. One impassioned writer let me know that“rather than blame our companies who ALL follow strict standards, or the consumers that they try to blame from time to time(telling us how to cook our eggs etc etc)- let&apos;s ask ourselves, what is really happening to our food supply, and other products?”She then proceeded to explain that the egg-salmonella outbreak was the product of“agroterrorists”intent on sickening and killing our citizens as part of an“Al Queda”(her spelling) plot.

An extreme viewpoint? Perhaps. But in a country in which all sorts of nutty beliefs become accepted as part of the national discourse, it is important to consider facts rather than unfounded beliefs.

The“facts”in this case are stated in the FDA Form 483 inspection reports of Quality Egg LLC  and Hillandale Farms just released by the government following inspections at the facilities of Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, the egg producers implicated in this outbreak (that collectively recalled 500 million eggs). These reports make it clear, in our humble opinion, that we don’t need terrorists to poison our food supply; we’re perfectly capable of doing it ourselves.

 Unsanitary Conditions at Wright County Egg Should Not Go over Easy 
 Posted on August 31, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
by Fred Pritzker

I represent victims of food poisoning. I represent them in cases involving Salmonella , E. coli , Listeria , Shigella and other nasty pathogens. 

The cases that bother me most are those in which food processors put profit over safety and needlessly endanger the health and safety of American consumers. I know these cases first hand. My firm represented the families of more people killed in the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) Salmonella outbreak than any other law firm in the United States.

 You remember PCA. The company sold peanut products to food producers that used the peanut paste to make thousands of snack products. The company was shut down and forced into bankruptcy after hundreds of people were sickened and several died as a result of Salmonella poisoning from the company’s peanuts.

As part of our thorough investigation, I traveled to the Blakely, Georgia PCA plant implicated in the outbreak and personally inspected it. What I found was appalling: filthy equipment, vermin and gaps in walls and the ceiling that allowed in any number of rodents, insects and other disease carrying animals. My observations mirrored those made by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the report of which may be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM109843.pdf .

 There is now another Salmonella outbreak. It involves half a billion eggs from two large producers in Iowa, Quality Egg LLC (Wright County Egg) , Galt, IA and Hillandale Farms , New Hampton, IA. Shockingly, these plants were never inspected by the FDA until after this recent outbreak.

It’s a pity they were not previously inspected. Here are some of the observations made by federal inspectors at Wright County Egg during their August inspections during the outbreak:

 Live frogs living in egg laying house Wild birds flying through egg laying houses Pigeons roosting in air vents Gaps and holes in building foundations large enough to admit vermin Evidence of rodent burrows located along baseboards “Dark liquid which appeared to be manure was observed seeping through the concrete foundation to the outside of the laying houses…” Employees not wearing or changing protective clothing when moving between laying houses Laying house entrance doors“blocked with excessive amounts of manure in the manure pits Live mice observed inside the egg laying houses 

The complete report may be viewed at: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM224399.pdf 

These disgusting findings come on the heels of other reports about the practices of Wright County Egg and its operator. According to a recent article in the New York Times : “The company behind the recall, Wright County Egg, of Galt, Iowa, is owned by Jack DeCoster, who has had run-ins with regulators over poor or unsafe working conditions, environmental violations, the harassment of workers and the hiring of illegal immigrants.”

We just sued Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms on behalf of one of the recent Salmonella outbreak victims. Here is the link to those court papers .  Contact me for more information about the egg lawsuit .

 Egg Safety Violations Piled High 
 Posted on August 31, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Numerous food safety violations at massive egg plants operated by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms were uncovered by Food and Drug Administration officials who inspected the Iowa mega farms for most of August.

The inspections were ordered after public health investigators tracked a multi-state Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak to shell eggs produced by the two operators. More than 1,400 illnesses have resulted, triggering an egg lawsuit by food safety lawyers at  PritzkerOlsen, P.A., 1-888-377-8900 (TOLL FREE). 

The FDA inspection reports showed similar violations at the two companies -- including chicken manure piles so high they were blocking some doors and pushing others open. Hens that had escaped their cages were using eight-foot-high manure piles to access the egg laying area at Wright County Egg, the reports said.

Many notations in the inspection reports referred to unsatisfactory rodent control -- from burrow holes in the walls to scurrying live mice in the barns. Wild birds were flying around inside the facilities and pigeons were roosting in openings in kernell corn grain bins.

Inspectors found maggots and flies too numerous to count, eight frogs under a board, grass between barns that was a foot high and disregard for practices meant to keep workers from tracking Salmonella Enteritidis from one place to another. 
 
 Kenneth E. Anderson, a professor of poultry science at North Carolina State University, told the New York Times:“I am surprised that an operation was being operated in that manner in this day and age.” 

 “Clearly the observations here reflect significant deviations from what’s expected,”FDA Deputy Commissioner Michael R. Taylor said in the same story. 
 
As previously reported, six environmental samples came back positive for Salmonella Enteritidis -- including a sample from Wright County Egg&apos;s pullet feed and Wright County Egg&apos;s meat and bone meal ingredient bin.

Dr Jeff Farrar, associate commissioner of food protection in the FDA&apos;s Office of Foods, told reporters that the FDA received one more positive Salmonella Enteritidis lab result that matches the outbreak strain from spent egg wash water from a facility at Hillandale Farms.

 Egg Lawsuit Filed by Attorney Fred Pritzker 
 Posted on August 30, 2010 by PritzkerLaw An egg lawsuit has been filed in northern Minnesota by PritzkerOlsen, P.A., on behalf of a woman from Mantorville who is a confirmed victim of the multi-state Salmonella egg outbreak.   The egg litigation seeks more than $100,000 for the woman and her husband.   According to the lawsuit, filed in Beltrami County, the woman ate at Mi Rancho restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota, on May 7, 2010, and started getting ill a short time later. The Minnesota Department of Health determined that she and at least six other patrons of the restaurant were sickened by the same identical strain of Salmonella Enteritidis.    Shell eggs were identified as the likely source of this outbreak and were traced back by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and FDA to Hillandale Farms of New Hampton, Iowa. Eggs from Hillandale Farms were then included in an expanded egg recall of more than half a billion eggs that started with Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.   Restaurant clusters like the one in Bemidji aided state and federal health investigators in framing the egg outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1,470 reported illnesses are likely to be associated with this outbreak, making it the largest Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak reported since CDC started outbreak surveillance in the early 1970s. “Our client’s severe illness could have been prevented at several levels, but those with the ability to protect her from Salmonella poisoning failed to do so,’’stated Attorney Fred Pritzker, lead attorney for the firm’s egg recall cases . “Our client and the hundreds of others sickened in this outbreak deserved better.”  PritzkerOlsen is in contact with other victims and is accepting cases for additional egg lawsuits against Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg.   Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, older adults and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In some cases, the organism can get into the bloodstream and produce arterial infections such as endocarditis and reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.    PritzkerOlsen, P.A. , represents individuals and families nationwide in cases involving foodborne illness. The firm is involved in virtually every major foodborne illness outbreak and has successfully obtained some of the largest verdicts and settlements in foodborne illness cases.

 Egg Lawsuit and Egg Recall Update 
 Posted on August 29, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Egg recall information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now searchable by brand name and other data, making a powerful consumer guide to 88 different egg brands involved in the recalls by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, both of Iowa.

Click here for the searchable egg recall list   that covers more than half a billion eggs.

 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1,470 reported illnesses were likely to be associated with this outbreak between May 1 to August 25. More are expected as investigation and testing continues in more than 20 states.

Smoking gun evidence was uncovered by FDA, linking the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis to the Iowa egg producers. Of 600 samples taken, six so far have come back with the same identical Salmonella strain that is making people sick.. One of those samples came from the feed mill at Wright County Egg and the feed was provided to young hens. The hens were distributed to all premises at both companies.

&quot;These findings indicate that Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa are the likely sources of the contaminated shell eggs,&apos;&apos; CDC has stated.

Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. is preparing an egg lawsuit on behalf of a woman who is confirmed by health authorities as a victim of this outbreak. Salmonella egg recall lawyers at the firm are in contact with other victims and the firm is continuing to accept cases. Free consultations are available at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page. 

 Many of the cases in this outbreak have been in people who attended catered social events or who ate at restaurants where clusters of illnesses were found . A person infected with the Salmonella Enteritidis bacterium usually has fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming a contaminated food or beverage. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without antibiotic treatment. However, the diarrhea can be severe, and the person may be ill enough to require hospitalization. 
 No deaths have been reported in this outbreak, but Salmonella infections can be life-threatening in young children, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems.   Newspapers and television have raised questions about pollution, animal cruelty, worker injustices and other problems at Wright County Egg and other operations owned by the DeCoster family. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg bluntly has said the DeCoster farms were not following&quot;standards of practice that we consider responsible.&quot;   A detailed egg recall and egg outbreak report is expected soon from the FDA.

 Chicken Feed Tied to Egg Outbreak 
 Posted on August 26, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
FDA investigators in the multi-state Salmonella egg outbreak are close to completing a report on their findings after looking for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis at Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms.

 In a preliminary announcement today, FDA officials said they found the outbreak strain of Salmonella in chicken feed used by both Iowa egg producers. The breakthrough is a smoking gun for egg lawsuits, creating a DNA fingerprint trace from ill consumers to the egg producers. 

Dr Jeff Farrar, associate commissioner of food protection in the FDA&apos;s Office of Foods, was quoted by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy as saying:&quot;We don&apos;t know how, when, or where the feed may have become contaminated. It raises additional questions at this point.&apos;&apos;

FDA investigators have been performing environmental assessments of farm conditions and practices including pest and rodent controls, biosecurity plans and controls; environmental monitoring; sanitary controls; and feed and laying hen sources. The investigators are also looking at commonalities between Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms.

 The agency says the Salmonella egg outbreak is the largest Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak ever recorded by the federal surveillance system established in the 1970s . The total egg recall has involved more than 500 million eggs distributed directly to 22 states and secondarily to other states.

Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. is preparing an egg lawsuit for victims of this outbreak and is continuing to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). To contact the firm online, complete the form on the side of this Web page.

 Egg Litigation Follows Salmonella Recalls 
 Posted on August 26, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Egg litigation is possible in 23 states where egg recalls indicate products potentially contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis were distributed.

The Center for Infections Disease Research and Policy reviewed company recall notices and other factors to arrive at 23 states. Health officials in Michigan, for instance, said recalled eggs were distributed in their state despite not being mentioned in recall notices by the two big Iowa producers at the center of the Salmonella egg outbreak .

 Together, Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, and Hillandale Farms have recalled more than half a billion eggs that may contain Salmonella , a human pathogen that can cause severe illness in young children, older adults and others who have weakened immune systems.

The Salmonella egg problem remains under active investigation by federal and state health investigators, with recalls continuing.

Wright County Egg, for instance, has added California-distributed Cardenas Market brand eggs to its recall list. Cardenas eggs included in the recall are labeled with plant number 1026 and Julian dates ranging from 136 to 228.

Another California distributor, Trafficanda Egg Ranch, said it is recalling eggs supplied by Wright County Egg that were packaged under the Trafficanda Egg Ranch brand for retailers and restaurant suppliers. The eggs are packaged in 12-egg cartons, 20-egg over wrap, and 5 dozen over wrap with the Julian dates ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1026, 1413, 1720, 1942 and1946 .
 
 &quot;There have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses from May 17, 2010 to August 17, 2010 relating to the shell eggs, and trace back investigations are ongoing,&quot;Trafficanda said. 
 
Hundreds if not thousands of people are estimated to have been sickened by Salmonella eggs in states across the country. California, Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska and Nevada are among the states with confirmed illnesses and large spikes in Salmonella Enteritidis cases believed to be caused by contaminated eggs.

If you or a loved one believe you have been sickened in this outbreak, your questions about egg litigation can be answered by Salmonella egg recall attorneys at PritzkerOlsen, P.A . at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Expanded CA Salmonella Egg Recall 
 Posted on August 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
California, Minnesota, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas, Nevada and Wisconsin are among at least 18 states where eggs potentially contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis have been sold.

 The California egg recall now includes retail brands and foodservice packages sold in southern California and Las Vegas by Moark LLC of Fontana. These retail brands are Albertsons, Yucaipa Valley, Farmer’s Gems and Mountain Dairy.

 How Do I Know if My Eggs are Part of the Recall? 
 Posted on August 24, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The FDA has put out some great information for consumers so that they can determine if the eggs in the refrigerator are part of the egg recall linked to eggs produced by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, both of Iowa (and run by the same family):
 
Dates and codes can be found stamped on the packaging. The plant number begins with the letter&quot;P&quot;, followed by a number (P-1946 in the example below). The Julian date follows the plant number (223 in the example).

  

It is important to note that both the plant number and Julian date must match. If the Julian date does not match the affected plant number, then your eggs are not currently involved in the recall.

The following table lists all brands of shell eggs under recall. The recalled eggs originated from Wright County Egg or from Hillandale Farms of Iowa. The brands listed were either recalled by these two firms or were recalled by other firms who received the eggs and repacked them under additional brand names.

 Salmonella Egg Update from CDC 
 Posted on August 23, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella egg investigations conducted by public health officials in 10 states since April have identified 26 restaurants or event clusters where more than one ill person with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis has eaten.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says in its latest update on the outbreak that shell eggs are a likely source of infections in many of these restaurants or event clusters. Information indicates that Wright County Egg, in Galt, Iowa, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 26 restaurants or event clusters.   Hillandale Farms of Iowa, Inc. was identified as another potential source of contaminated shell eggs contributing to this outbreak, according to CDC.    Together, Wright County Egg and Hillandale have recalled half a billion eggs that may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis. Extrapolating from hundreds of confirmed illness, officials believe thousands of Americans have been sickened in this outbreak in at least 10 states.  The CDC warns that recalled eggs might still be in grocery stores, restaurants, and consumers&apos; homes. Click here to see an updated list of brands, plant numbers and Julian dates included in the recall.   Individuals who think they might have become ill from eating recalled eggs should consult their health care provider.   For answers to legal questions about an egg lawsuit, contact food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Salmonella Egg Recall Draws Congress 
 Posted on August 23, 2010 by PritzkerLaw The egg recall and Salmonella outbreaks that have sickened hundreds if not thousands of Americans have prompted a member of Congress to start asking questions.   The Washington Post said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn ., will ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA what they knew about the activities Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, -- the egg producer at the center of the Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that has sickened people in at least 10 states. Minnesota, Colorado, California, Texas, and Wisconsin are among those states.   DeLauro chairs the House Appropriations agriculture subcommittee.   In the past 20 years, the DeCoster family that runs the company, has withstood a string of reprimands, penalties and complaints about its performance, the Post reported. DeLauro wants to know what regulators knew about the problems.   The DeCoster family also has ties to Hillandale Farms of Iowa, which on Friday recalled 170 million eggs distributed to 14 states in the Midwest and West.   The egg recall all together applies to 550 million eggs. The FDA oversees inspections of shell eggs and the Agriculture Department is in charge of inspecting other egg products. The Post said that 26 Salmonella outbreaks investigated by federal agencies found that 15 pointed to Wright County Egg.   Minnesota Department of Health has associated a Salmonella Enteritidis at a restaurant in Bemidji, Minnesota, to eggs from Hillandale.   For families affected by these outbreaks, questions about an egg lawsuit can be answered by law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A . at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).   PritzkerOlsen is a leading food safety law firm involved in virtually every foodborne illness outbreak in the United States.

 Egg Lawsuit Will Review Violations 
 Posted on August 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Egg lawsuit stemming from the multi-state Salmonella Enteritidis  outbreak will consider the history of health and safety violations at the plants involved in producing more than half a billion eggs that may be contaminated.

  Washington Post today published a story about repeated health and safety violations by Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa. Other media outlets have written similar stories.

According to the Post story, the company has withstood a string of reprimands, penalties and complaints about its performance in several states.

Food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker said that if the news accounts are true, the owners of Wright County Egg&quot;join a rogue&apos;s gallery of pernicious operators that endanger the public.&apos;&apos;

Pritzker proposes new laws that impose meaningful sanctions -- such as criminal prosecution and loss of licensure for repeat violators of food safety laws. As founder and president of PritzkerOlsen, P.A., he is involved in virtually every foodborne illness outbreak in the United States as a representative for victims.
 
According to the Washington Post, an example of problems at Wright County Egg occurred as recently as June. The owners agreed to pay a $34,675 fine stemming from allegations of animal cruelty against hens in its 5 million-bird Maine facility.

An animal rights group used a hidden camera to document hens suffocating in garbage cans, twirled by their necks , kicked into manure pits to drown and hanging by their feet over conveyor belts, the story said.
 
 The federal investigation into the Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that has sickened hundreds if not thousands of Americans is continuing . More than half a billion eggs have been recalled by Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, also of Iowa. The Post story said Wright County Egg and Hillandale share suppliers of young chickens and feed,

 Minnesota Salmonella Egg Outbreak 
 Posted on August 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Minnesota Salmonella egg illnesses -- confirmed by the Minnesota Department of Health -- have risen from seven to 14.

The agency said in a press release this weekend that all confirmed Salmonella Enteritidis cases in the state have been connected with the expanded egg recall in Iowa due to Salmonella contamination.

 The seven new Minnesota Salmonella egg cases were identified as part of a restaurant outbreak in Bemidji, Minnesota, in May.

&quot;Shell eggs were identified as the likely source of this outbreak and were traced back by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and FDA to Hillandale Farms of New Hampton, Iowa,&apos;&apos; the health department said.

Eggs from Hillandale Farms have now been included in an expanded egg recall that also includes Wright County Egg. Click here for the egg recall update to see brands and plant codes covered by the egg recalls.
 
 Combined, more than half a billion eggs are involved in the egg recall, which involves distribution in many states from California to the Upper Midwest to Mississippi. 
 
Minnesota health officials have said that as a rule of thumb, for every 1 confirmed Salmonella illness there are 38 more in people who have not sought medical attention or who saw a doctor but were not sampled for a stool culture.

If you or a loved one has been sickened in this outbreak, call law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. about a Minnesota egg lawsuit at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Egg Recall Number 3: Cal-Maine Foods 
 Posted on August 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Egg recall that began with Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, has now expanded from some 320 million eggs to more than half a billion, according to The Associated Press.

 The latest recall was announced by Cal-Maine Foods Inc., the nation&apos;s largest egg seller and distributor, with headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi. Iowa is in the company&apos;s production network.

Cal-Maine announced it is recalling about 800,000 dozen eggs related to the Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that federal officials say has sickened thousands of Americans. Many of the confirmed cases stemmed from restaurant outbreaks or clusters of illnesses resulting from food-catered social events.

The Cal-Maine egg recall applies to 32 truckloads of eggs it received from Iowa between April 9 and Aug. 19, the producer has said. The original producer wasn&apos;t named.

Besides Wright County Egg recalling 320 million eggs, Iowa&apos;s Hillandale Farms said Friday that it was recalling more than 100 million eggs after laboratory tests confirmed Salmonella contamination. 
 FDA spokeswoman Pat El-Hinnawy told the AP the Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg recalls are related. The strain of Salmonella bacteria causing the poisoning is the same in both cases, Salmonella enteritidis. For information about a possible egg lawsuit , call an egg recall lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, P.A.     If you or a loved one has been infected by Salmonella after consuming eggs, you may be able to recover damages beyond medical expenses.

 Another Egg Recall: Hillandale Farms Joins Wright County Egg 
 Posted on August 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Hundreds of people have contracted Salmonella enteritidis infections in a national outbreak linked to eggs. Prompted by this outbreak, on August 13 and August 18 , Wright County Egg of Galt Iowa recalled over 300 million eggs because the companies eggs had been implicated as a possible source of the outbreak. Now, Hillandale Farms of Iowa has recalled over 100 million shell eggs because&quot;there have been laboratory-confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses associated with the shell eggs.&quot;

The recalled Hillandale eggs were distributed to grocery distribution centers, retail grocery stores and foodservice companies. People have contracted Salmonella enteritidis infections after eating at restaurants, events and at home. 

At least 26 restaurant-associated Salmonella enteritidis outbreaks may have been caused by eggs, according to the CDC. 

The recalled Hillandale eggs were distributed under the following brand names:

 Hillandale Farms Sunny Farms Sunny Meadow 

They were distributed in 6-egg cartons, dozen-egg cartons, 18-egg cartons, 30-egg package, and 5-dozen cases.

Loose eggs were packaged under the following brand names: Wholesome Farms and West Creek in 15 and 30-dozen tray packs. The loose eggs may have been repackaged under a different brand..

The only eggs effected by this recall have plant numbers P1860 or P1663 and Julian dates as follows:

 P1860–Julian dates ranging from 099 to 230 P1663–Julian dates ranging from 137 to 230 

 Only eggs with these plant numbers are effected - even though the brand name may be the same

Julian dates and plant codes can be found stamped on the end of the egg carton or printed on the case label. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for example: P1860 230.

During this outbreak, new federal egg safety rules went into effect. In addition to other safety measures, these rules require additional testing to prevent Salmonella outbreaks. Policy makers, regulators and the consuming public have a right to know whether Hillandale Farms was adequately testing for Salmonella and following the most up-to-date safety rules. The public has a right to know why this outbreak happened.

 Mamey Smoothie Typhoid Fever Risk 
 Posted on August 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
If you think you can&apos;t contract typhoid fever in the United States, ask one of the nine people who contracted typhoid fever after consuming a mamey smoothie with a little Salmonella Typhi thrown in at juice bars in California and Nevada.  

 Mamey Smoothie Typhoid Fever Outbreak Facts 

 Our law firm is investigating a tyhpoid fever outbreak in the United States linked to mamey pulp ( free consultation about a mamey pulp lawsuit ). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned consumers not to eat frozen mamey fruit pulp sold under the La Nuestra brand by Montalvan Sales Inc. Ontario, Calif., or the Goya brand by Goya Foods Inc. Secaucus, N.J. The CDC reports that at least nine people in California (5) and Nevada (4) are ill with typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi. Ill individuals have reported consuming products, including mamey fruit smoothies, made with La Nuestra or Goya brand frozen mamey fruit pulp. 

An investigation by the CDC and health officials in California and Nevada showed an epidemiologic link between an ongoing outbreak of Salmonella Typhi and frozen mamey fruit pulp sold under the La Nuestra brand by Montalvan Sales Inc. Ontario, California, and under the Goya brand by Goya Foods Inc. Secaucus, New Jersey. This evidence can be used to sue Goya Foods or Montalvan Sales for payment of medical bills and compensation for lost income, emotional distress and pain and suffering. 

People with typhoid fever have reported consuming mamey fruit pulp, including mamey fruit smoothies at juice stands.This means that the owners of the fruit stands may also be sued.

 What is Typhoid Fever and How Can You Get It from a Mamey Smoothie?  

Typhoid Fever is a serious bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics. There are approximately 400 cases in the United States annually, 70 percent of which are acquired while traveling internationally. Infection occurs when a patient eats or drinks food or beverages handled by a person who is“shedding”the Salmonella Typhi bacterium in his stool, or if sewage is contaminated with the bacterium and the water is used for drinking or washing food. The investigation into how the Salmonella Typhi got into the frozen mamey juice is continuing. Because both companies involved got their mamey pulp from the same supplier in Guatemala, the contamination most likely happened there.

Typhoid fever can last up to three or four weeks. Symptoms occur within three days and up to three months after consuming contaminated food or water and include a sustained fever as high as 103 F to 104 F as well as stomach pains, a headache, anorexia, a slow heart rate, malaise, constipation or diarrhea, or a non-productive cough. People are the only host for the Salmonella Typhi bacterium, which is carried in the bloodstream and intestinal tract. Ten percent of untreated patients can remain infectious for as many as three months after the onset of symptoms, and 2 to 5 percent of these patients can become permanent carriers.

If you or a family member has been diagnosed with typhoid fever, our Salmonella lawyers are available for a free consultation .

 La Neustra and Goya Typhoid Fever Outbreak 
 Posted on August 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning consumers not to eat frozen mamey fruit pulp sold under the La Nuestra brand by Montalvan Sales Inc. Ontario, California, or the Goya brand by Goya Foods Inc. Secaucus, New Jersey. The two companies get their mamey fruit from a common supplier in Guatemala. The pulp was used by juice stands to make mamey smoothies.

An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments showed an epidemiologic link between an ongoing outbreak of Salmonella Typhi infections and the products. This means that interviews with patients and their families found that a statistically high number of people sickened in the outbreak had consumed frozen mamey pulp sold under the La Nuestra and Goya brands.

The CDC reports that at least nine people in California and Nevada are ill with typhoid fever , caused by Salmonella Typhi. Ill individuals have reported consuming mamey fruit pulp, including mamey fruit smoothies at juice stands.

Goya Foods Inc. and La Nuestra have voluntarily recalled their products:
 
Both the Goya and La Nuestra products are sold frozen. The Goya product is sold in 14-ounce packages in retail stores nationwide. All production lot codes are being recalled. The UPC is 041331090803.

The La Nuestra brand mamey pulp comes in a 14-ounce plastic package. All lot numbers are affected by this recall; however, packages produced prior to May 2009 are not identified with a lot number and are subject to this recall as well. The UPC is 7-56869-10008-4.

Mamey fruit (sometime referred to as&quot;zapote&quot;) is large and round, has brown skin and a fleshy orange pulp. It is grown mainly in the tropical lowlands of Central America and is very popular among the Hispanic community, especially in juices and fruit shakes (called&quot;batidos&quot;).
 
Infections with

 Salmonella 

Typhi cause typhoid fever, a serious illness that can result in death. People with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103 degrees to 104 degrees F (39 degrees to 40 degrees C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite.

The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi. If you suspect you or a family member has typhoid fever, it is important that you or the family member see a health care professional immediately. If you or your family member is diagnosed with typhoid fever, contact our law firm about a lawsuit against the owner of the juice stand and Goya Foods or Montalvan .

 Egg Recall Requires Look into Company&apos;s Past Food Safety Problems 
 Posted on August 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
by Fred Pritzker

Here we go again - another foodborne illness recall–this time involving hundreds of millions of eggs that may be contaminated with Salmonella. According to the CDC, nearly 2,000 people have been sickened so far and the number is inevitably going to rise.

The company, Wright County Egg based in Galt, Iowa, and its owner, Jack DeCoster, are no strangers to food safety and environmental problems. News accounts indicate the company has been fined for insanitary conditions, hiring illegal workers, and–just this year–DeCoster pleaded guilty to numerous counts of animal cruelty. He has also been sued for sexual harassment, according to the news report. A more detailed account of this sorry history may be found at http://abcnews.go.com/m/screen?id=11440513 .

I’ve been a food safety lawyer for many years. My firm is involved in just about every major foodborne illness outbreak in the United States. Thus, I’ve litigated cases against big and small operators, those that care about food safety, those that don’t give a damn and everything in between.

There has to be a special place in hell, however, for companies (and their owners) that habitually put profits over people and blithely violate safety laws resulting in human suffering and death.

DeCoster, if the news accounts are true and the outbreak is definitively traced back to his company, joins a rogue’s gallery of pernicious operators that endanger the public.

Every industry and profession (including lawyers, I might add) has a small number of rotten eggs (sorry, it was just too hard to pass up) that habitually violate the rules. Fortunately, in most other businesses, these violators don’t have the ability to sicken and kill large numbers of innocent people. Not so for food processors. And that’s why laws have to be enacted that allow easier criminal prosecution of companies and their owners that willfully and/or repeatedly harm consumers. That’s also why laws have to be enacted to strip companies of their right to do business when it becomes clear their products are unsafe.

This is not such a radical idea. Any professional who commits a serious crime or repeatedly violates professional standards has his/her license revoked. Without a license, a professional cannot work and the public is no longer at risk. Why do food processors have the“right”to repeatedly violate the law and put the health and safety of the public at risk?

 Los Angeles Salmonella Egg Recall 
 Posted on August 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Like the peanut Salmonella outbreak of 2008-2009, the  Salmonella Egg outbreak associated with Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, is triggering secondary recalls.

 

As a mega-producer, Wright County sells to other packagers. Hence, Los Angeles-based Country Eggs Inc. has announced a recall of shell eggs that it purchased from Wright County Egg.

Country Eggs is recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis.  
 Eggs affected by the recall were distributed to food wholesalers, distribution centers and foodservice companies in California, Arizona and Nevada.   California is one of three states that has affirmatively associated human illness with contaminated eggs produced by Wright County Egg. A spike of more than 200 California cases of Salmonella Enteritidis sparked the probe, including more than 40 illnesses in Los Angeles County.   According to the Country Eggs Salmonella recall notice: Eggs were packaged under the Country Eggs, Inc brand name in 15 dozen bulk pack with the identifying plant code of P 1946 and P 1026. Julian code dates are 216-221. Dates and codes can be found on the box label.    Nationwide, the FDA and CDC are investigating nearly 2,000 Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses as part of an aggressive Wright County Egg investigation . Investigators estimate that not all of the cases will be associated with the eggs from Iowa.   If you or a loved one has been sickened with Salmonella that may be part of this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, P.A. for a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.   PritzkerOlsen is a leading food safety law firm involved in virtually every foodborne illness outbreak in the United States.

 Texas Salmonella Egg Outbreak Probed 
 Posted on August 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Texas Salmonella egg outbreak is under investigation and the Texas Department of State Health Services is advising consumers to heed the Salmonella egg recall from Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.

 Since mid-May in Texas, there have been more than 150 Salmonella Enteritidis infections in more than 40 counties throughout the state. The health department said in a press release:&quot;Investigation is ongoing to determine if Wright County Egg products are linked to the illnesses.&apos;&apos;

Wright County Egg company issued a recall on eggs from its facility in Galt, Iowa, on August 13 and then expanded the recall three days later to include 380 million eggs, or 32 million egg cartons. Wright County eggs are shipped to Texas by way of one or more intermediary distributors, the health department said.

Click here for a list of Wright County Egg brand names and other recall information. 

Evidence of an association between Wright County Egg and this foodborne diarrheal illness has emerged from restaurant Salmonella outbreaks and clusters of Salmonella case among people who have attended the same social events. Sometimes raw or undercooked eggs are involved as ingredients in salad dressing or meringue.

 
 
 Nationally, nearly 2,000  Salmonella  Enteritidis illnesses are being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FDA and state health agencies to d etermine how ma ny were caused by contaminated eggs from Iowa.  
 
So far, no deaths have been reported. Most health adults survive Salmonella infections with no treatment, but they can be potentially lethal for young children, older adults and others with weakened or under-developed immune systems.

Minnesota, Colorado, California, Nevada, Wisconsin and Illinois are among other possible Salmonella egg hot spots.

 Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A . is conducting its own investigation of the egg Salmonella outbreak and is in contact with victims.

 Latest Salmonella Egg Recall Information 
 Posted on August 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The latest Salmonella egg recall information is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an outbreak investigation update. The CDC is reporting that a total of nearly 2,000 illnesses are being examined as possbily part of the nationwide Salmonella Enteritidis egg outbreak.

 The associated  Salmonella egg recall by Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, has been expanded to cover 380 million eggs, or 32 million egg cartons.

According to the CDC, public health officials in 10 states since April have identified 26 restaurants or events where more than one ill person with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis has eaten.

Data from these investigations suggest that shell eggs are a likely source of infections in many of these restaurants or events. Preliminary information indicates that Wright County Egg, in Galt, Iowa, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 26 restaurants or events, the CDC said.

Formal tracebacks conducted by public health officials in California, Colorado, and Minnesota have found that shell eggs from five of these restaurants or events were from a single firm, Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa. California alone has had more than 200 of these cases so far this year -- far more than normal for the state during this time period.

An extensive federal investigation taking place at Wright County Egg in Iowa is looking for potential sources of contamination, such as feed, the CDC press release said.

All indications are that this Salmonella Enteritidis egg outbreak could be one of the largest food poisoning episodes of 2010. 
 
  From May 1 to July 31, 2010, a total of 1,953 Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses were reported on CDC&apos;s national molecular subtyping network, PulseNet. The normal count of Salmonella Enteritidis cases over the same period is about 700. 
 
 A key to the investigation is distinguishing the egg cases from non-outbreak background cases.

 Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. is providing free case consultations to anyone who has eaten eggs and fallen ill. For information about a Salmonella egg lawsuit, call the firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Umpqua Dairy Salmonella Outbreak Reported by Oregon Public Health 
 Posted on August 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Umpqua Dairy Salmonella Outbreak was announced late yesterday by Oregon Public Health in conjunction with the recall of milk products sold in Oregon and parts of California and Washington

 Umpqua Dairy in Roseburg, Oregon, has suspended operations while it works with health teams to remedy this public health hazard. The recall involves milk, half and half, cream and buttermilk as well as Umpqua Dairy brand gallon orange juice and fruit drinks. Ice cream, sour cream and cottage cheese are not being recalled.

Meanwhile, Salmonella Braenderup illnesses in  23 people, all in Oregon, have been laboratory-confirmed with matching DNA patterns, according to Oregon Public Health . Two people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The investigation started in October 2009 and has been slow developing. Consumer risk is deemed&quot;very low&apos;&apos; because the rate of illness reports has been 1 for every million containers that Umpqua has sold since January.
 
 Dr. Paul Cieslak of Oregon Public Health Division reports that although pasteurization is effective at removing Salmonella , recent testing at the Umpqua&apos;s Roseburg Dairy identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella on several different surfaces. 
 The state advises people who have consumed any Umpqua Dairy products and developed Salmonella symptoms should discuss this exposure with a health care provider. For answers to legal questions about a possible Umpqua Salmonella lawsuit, call law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A . at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.   We are a leading practitioner of foodborne disease litigation and we have collected millions for victims of food poisoning.   In the Umpqua Salmonella outbreak, the following numbers of people from these counties have been infected with this Salmonella: Douglas, 6; Marion, 3; Jackson, 3; Lane, 3; Linn, 3; Josephine, 2; Coos, 1; Deschutes, 1; and Klamath, 1.    Umpqua also sells under the labels: Cascade, Great Value, Lady Lee, Market of Choice and Sherm’s.    Umpqua Dairy Salmonella Recall Details :   Recalled products have a plant code 41-62 stamped on them. The recall affects milk, purchased on or prior to Monday, Aug. 16, 2010 or earlier or with an expiration date of Sept. 5, 2010 or earlier; buttermilk with an expiration date of Sept. 10, 2010, or earlier; orange juice and fruit drink with an expiration date of Sept. 15 or earlier.

 Nevada Salmonella Egg Cases Spike 
 Posted on August 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Nevada Salmonella Egg concerns have peaked because the state has seen a spike in Salmonella Enteritidis cases and Wright County Egg lists Nevada as a distribution point for eggs recalled because of possible contamination.

The Southern Nevada Health District has identified a very sizable increase in the number of Salmonella Enteritidis cases of a specific type in the community. The health district has not pinned down the cause, but it has reported 30 cases of this type since January 2010, which is four times more than normally reported. 

The health district said it is collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service to investigate the nationwide increase in Salmonella Enteritidis. With help from CDC and FDA, health investigators from Minnesota, California and Colorado have all associated clusters and spikes of these infections to shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.

Nevada consumers who have fallen ill after consuming egg products should seek immediate care from a physician and request a stool culture be taken. For answers to legal questions about a Nevada Salmonella egg lawsuit, call law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A . at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web site.

 Egg Salmonella Lawsuit on Horizon 
 Posted on August 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) associating a national outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis with eggs from Iowa, there is a solid framework for an egg Salmonella lawsuit. 

 The CDC&apos;s latest announcement on the Wright County Egg Salmonella outbreak said California, Colorado and Minnesota all have data suggesting the association. State and federal investigators have traced clusters of Salmonella infections from restaurants or events to the mass egg producer based in Galt, Iowa.

The company issued a recall three days ago and federal health officials announced Wednesday they have expanded the recall of eggs linked to the Salmonella outbreak to 380 million eggs, or 32 million dozen-egg cartons.

Law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A. is continuing to accept cases for an egg Salmonella lawsuit and is conducting its own investigation into conditions that may have led to the hundreds of illnesses of Salmonella Enteritidis associated with contaminated eggs.

 Wright County Egg Lawsuit: Salmonella enteritidis Food Poisoning Outbreak 
 Posted on August 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The following was released August 13, 2010:
 
Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa is voluntarily recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by their farms because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella . Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or arthritis.
 
 Wright County Egg Lawsuit 

To determine who is part of a Salmonella enteritidis outbreak and the source of an outbreak, health officials use both microbiology and epidemiology. Both types of evidence can be used in a Salmonella lawsuit against the parties responsible for the contamination of the food product and the sale and distribution of the contaminated product.

The microbiology is a series of tests on samples of Salmonella taken from suspected food and the stools of people sickened.

Initial tests determine if the bacteria is Salmonella enteritidis . If testing confirms that you have Salmonella enteritidis , the law in your state requires that your doctor or the hospital has to report the test findings to the state health department. The state health department will usually do further testing (or send the sample to the Unites States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) to confirm if the genetic fingerprint of your sample matches the genetic fingerprint of the salmonella strains from other people associated with this outbreak.

The epidemiology used involves primarily interviews with people who have been sickened and their families. Health officials get information about where the sick person has been, what he or she ate and other questions that will give direction as to a source of the outbreak.

 Determining Victims of an Salmonella Outbreak 

A series of events occurs between the time someone is infected and when public health officials determine that the patient is part of an outbreak. So, there will be a delay between the start of illness and confirmation that a patient is part of an outbreak.

Steps to confirmation that a person is part of an outbreak:

 Laboratory Salmonella diagnosis from a stool sample and genetic testing Diagnosis based on Salmonella symptoms 

For  Salmonella enteritidis lawsuit purposes, it is valuable to have a state health department and/or the CDC determine that a person with a Salmonella infection is part of a foodborne outbreak. This can be used as evidence in court that:

 The person with the Salmonella infection was a victim of the foodborne outbreak The restaurant, food processor and/or other party linked to the outbreak is liable for the victim’s damages 

Victims of Salmonella outbreaks should consult an experienced Salmonella lawsuit lawyer regarding an Salmonella lawsuit&apos;s strength and the amount of damages that should be sought.

 Wright County Egg Recall Effects California, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa Egg Distributors 
 Posted on August 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Wright County Egg has voluntarily issued a recall on 228,000,000 shell eggs due to possible Salmonella contamination.

Wright County Egg is one of the largest egg producing companies in the country. It is based in Galt, Iowa. The egg recall is only applicable to shell eggs with plant codes of P1026, P1413 and P1946. The eggs were packaged between May 16th and August 13th and were sold to distributors and wholesalers in California, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin and Iowa.


The Wright County Egg voluntary recall was issued after the product was linked to Salmonella enteritidis illnesses were reported in California (266), Minnesota (7), Nevada and Colorado. The CDC reported that they have seen four times as many Salmonella enteritidis illnesses reported in June and July.

The Centers for Disease Control has issued an advisory to state health departments, hospitals, and nursing homes on specific measures to reduce the spread of Salmonella enteritidis . Government agencies and the egg industry are also working to reduce Salmonella enteritidis outbreaks by identifying and removing infected flocks from the egg supply and tightening quality assurance and sanitation measures. In addition, eggs from known infected commercial flocks will be pasteurized instead of being sold as grade A shell eggs.

 Ways to Reduce the Risk of Salmonella enteritidis Infection 

 Refrigerate whole eggs. Throw out cracked or dirty eggs. Thoroughly wash hands and cooking utensils with soap and water if they come into contact with raw eggs. Eat eggs soon after cooking. Do not have eggs out for more than 2 hours. Immediately refrigerate unused or leftover foods that contain eggs. Do not eat raw eggs (as in homemade ice cream, raw cookie dough or eggnog). Avoid restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked, unpasteurized eggs (such as Hollandaise sauce or Caesar salad dressing).

 Posted on August 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella Egg Recall 

 Wright County Egg, Galt, Iowa, is voluntarily recalling 228,000,000 shell eggs because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis . Salmonella bacterium can cause serious, life-threatening infections in small children, elderly people and anyone with a weakened immune system.

These retailers distribute nationwide, so check the eggs in your refrigerator for the follwing brands: Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph’s, Boomsma’s, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps .

 Wright County Egg Salmonella Recall 
 Posted on August 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Wright County Egg Salmonella recall is estimated by The Associated Press to cover some 228 million eggs distributed nationwide since May 19, 2010.

A joint field investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is ongoing and intended to identify potential sources of Salmonella Enteritidis in these shell eggs, such as feed. 

Public health officials in California, Colorado and Minnesota have confirmed outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis traced back to Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa. The number of cases in California alone is 266, including 43 in Los Angeles County.
 This has the makings of a large nationwide outbreak as the following states also are investigating human Salmonella  Enteritidis infections: Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.   Since May 2010, CDC has identified a nationwide, four-fold increase in the number of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates through PulseNet, the molecular subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories. CDC received reports of approximately 200 cases every week during late June and early July compared to an average of 50 per week in that time period over the past five years.   Many clusters of illnesses associated with this egg Salmonella outbreak occurred at restaurants or social gatherings and law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A . is conducting its own investigation.

 Assi Market Pickel Salmonella Outbreak

 Salmonella Egg Outbreak CO CA MN 
 Posted on August 17, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Like Minnesota, health officials in Colorado and California have traced Salmonella  outbreaks to the same Iowa egg farm doing business as Wright County Egg.

The CO, CA and MN Salmonella egg outbreaks are under investigation now by state and federal health investigators, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 According to an Aug 4 Jefferson County Colorado Public Health statement, 28 people who ate at a locally owned restaurant called The Fort between July 10 and July 16 got sick. Salmonella Enteritidis was confirmed in 8 of the cases and suspected in 20.    Dr Shaun Cosgrove, an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, told CIDRAP News that discussions at a food safety conference in Anaheim, coupled with investigations, led to a finding that all egg products with links to clusters of illnesses in Colorado, California and Minesota came from the same farm in Iowa.   Minnesota officials have confirmed seven Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses matching the outbreak strain and they suspect many more. The seven confirmed Minnesota Salmonella egg cases were related to two restaurant outbreaks in May and June.   There are signs the outbreak could be nationwide. CIDRAP cited a CDC statement that said the CDC, FDA, and the US Department of Agriculture are investigating a fourfold national increase in the number of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates with the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern.   In June and July about 200 isolates with the same genetic fingerprint were submitted, compared with about 50 monthly uploads usually seen over the past 5 years. The CDC said many states have reported increases in the pattern since May.  A person infected with the Salmonella Enteritidis bacterium usually has fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming a contaminated food or beverage. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without antibiotic treatment. However, the diarrhea can be severe, and the person may be ill enough to require hospitalization.   Salmonella deaths occur every year. Most at risk are young children, older adults and others who have weakened or under-developed immune systems.   If you or a loved one has fallen ill after eating eggs, see a physician immediately for care and a stool culture. For answers to legal questions about a possible Salmonella egg lawsuit, call law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.   Our firm has launched its own investigation and is providing free case consultations to victims. As a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation, we have collected millions for victims of food poisoning.   Salmonella Egg Recall Information :    Wright County Egg said the eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers, distribution centers and foodservice companies in California, Illinois, Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. These companies distribute nationwide.    Eggs from Wright County Egg are packaged under the following brand names:  Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph’s, Boomsma’s, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps.   Recalled eggs are packed in varying sizes of cartons (6-egg cartons, dozen egg cartons, 18-egg cartons) with Julian dates ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946.

 Goya Zapote Associated With Typhoid Fever 
 Posted on August 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Goya Zapote, or frozen mamey fruit pulp, has been associated with a Typhoid Fever outbreak in California and Nevada. 

This Goya mamey fruta pulp, also known as Sapote, is commonly used to make batido or licuado (milkshake or smoothie).

 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), four confirmed cases of Typhoid Fever in Clark County, Nevada, carry the same matching strain of Salmonella Typhi as do three confirmed cases and two suspected cases in California.

Until further notice, the CDC is advising consumers not to drink or eat Goya brand frozen mamey fruit pulp, or zapote. Goya announced a recall of its 14-ounce packages of frozen mamey fruta pulp one day before the CDC published its typhoid fever outbreak investigation.

 Goya said its Mamey Pulp was distributed in the states of AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, NM, NV, OR, TX, UT, and WA through retail stores. The product comes in a 14 ounce plastic package and is not marked with a lot number or expiration date. The UPC is 041331090803. 
 Abogados at  Pritzker Olsen law firm are conducting their own investigation of this Zapote Typhoid Fever outbreak and they are preparing a possible Zapote lawsuit on behalf of victims.

 Typhoid Fever Outbreak Associated with Goya Frozen Mamey Fruit Pulp 
 Posted on August 13, 2010 by PritzkerLaw As part of a multi-agency Salmonella Typhi outbreak investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising consumers not to eat or drink Goya brand frozen mamey fruit pulp until further notice.   Salmonella Typhi is the bacterium that causes typhoid fever. The investigation by CDC and state public health officials in California and Nevada has found four confirmed cases in Clark County, Nevada, three confirmed illnesses in California and two additional California cases listed as&quot;probable.&apos;&apos;   Typhoid fever is a very rare illness in the United States among non-international travelers and can cause serious symptoms, often times requiring hospitalization. Typhoid fever is contracted when food and water are contaminated by an infected individual and are then consumed by other people 
 Mamey, also called“zapote”or“sapote,”is a tropical fruit grown primarily in Central and South America. Five of the seven Typhoid Fever patients interviewed by investigators reported consuming frozen mamey fruit pulp in a milkshake or smoothie, also called a“batido”or“licuado.”

Upon further investigation, it was found that 4 of 5 ill persons consumed Goya brand frozen mamey fruit pulp, the CDC reported.&quot;These results suggest that eating frozen mamey fruit pulp is a likely source of these illnesses,&apos;&apos; the agency said.

 One day prior to the outbreak announcement from CDC, Goya Foods Inc. of Seacaucus, New Jersey, recalled its 14 ounce packages of Frozen Mamey Pulp, due to a potential health risk from Salmonella . 

The recalled Goya brand Mamey Pulp was distributed in the states of AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, NM, NV, OR, TX, UT, and WA through retail stores. The product comes in a 14 ounce plastic package and is not marked with a lot number or expiration date. The UPC is 041331090803.

 Ohio Taco Bell Salmonella Investigation 
 Posted on August 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Ohio Taco Bell Salmonella cases total at least 25, including 19 Salmonella Hartford illnesses and six Salmonella Baildon.

Both strains are considered rare and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuing to investigate even though the outbreaks appear to be over. Investigators would like to find the specific ingredient or food that was contaminated with the bacteria, but those efforts have so far been unsuccessful. Fresh produce -- lettuce and or tomatoes -- has been closely examined because the short shelf life of the outbreak is consistent with a supply of contaminated vegetables.

The Ohio cases are part of a multi-state outbreak that has resulted in 155 confirmed illnesses in more than 17 states. Ohio, Kentucky and Wisconsin are the leading states. 

Public health reporter Misti Crane of the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported today that ten Ohioans sickened in the outbreak were hospitalized. She also quoted a Taco Bell official, chief quality assurance officer Anna Ohki, as saying there is no reason to avoid eating at Taco Bell.

The last reported case in Ohio was in early July. Nationally, the cases confirmed by public health officials began in April.

An interesting from the field is that there was no overlap in restaurant locations when it came to the two strains of Salmonella.

Law firm Pritzker Olsen is conducting its own investigation of this outbreak on behalf of victims. If you or a loved one has been sickened by Salmonella Hartford or Salmonella Baildon after eating at Taco Bell, call a Salmonella lawyer at our firm for a free case consultation at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Minneapolis Food Poisoning Attorney Salmonella Chester Outbreak 
 Posted on August 9, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Minneapolis food poisoning attorney Fred Pritzker has been involved for years in all outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in Minnesota, including this year&apos;s Salmonella Chester outbreak linked to Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice .

In all, 37 persons in 18 states were infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella when the multi-state outbreak was first announced June 25 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Two of the people sickened in the outbreak are from Minnesota.

 In fact, a big breakthrough in the case was achieved by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory. The lab found the outbreak strain of Salmonella in an unopened package of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice single-serve frozen entrée collected from the home of one of the ill people.
 Click here to see details of  ConAgra&apos;s recall,  which was announced June 17 and still is in effect.   Because the agent in this outbreak is a frozen food, the chance remains that others will become sick.  Freezing temperatures are not enough to kill Salmonella and other human pathogens.   Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12-72 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by culture of a stool sample. The illness usually lasts from 4 to 7 days.   Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections may occur. One such complication is known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome , also known as reactive arthritis.   If you or a loved one has been sickened in this outbreak in Minnesota or any other state, call Pritzker Olsen for a free case consultation on a Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella lawsuit. As a Minneapolis food poisoning attorney who has collected millions of dollars for victims of foodborne illness, Mr. Pritzker is quoted frequently by news organizations such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and CNN.   Contact Fred by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact for on the side of this Web page.   Tags: Food Poisoning Attorney , Marie Callender , Minnesota Salmonella Lawyer , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawsuit

 Wisconsin Taco Bell Salmonella Baildon 
 Posted on August 8, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Wisconsin Taco Bell Salmonella Baildon outbreak has sickened at least 22 people and is part of a multi-state Salmonella Baildon outbreak that health investigators believe may have been caused by contaminated lettuce and/or tomatoes.

Nationally and in Wisconsin, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes the outbreak is over, but an investigation is continuing into the cause. Wisconsin could be a key state in understanding the outbreak because so many people there had confirmed cases. 

Law firm Pritzker Olsen is conducting its own investigation of the outbreak and is in communication with outbreak victims to prepare for a possible Wisconsin Taco Bell Salmonella lawsuit, as well as in other states. For a free case consultation, victims of this outbreak may call a Salmonella lawyer at the firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

Combined with a coinciding  Salmonella Hartford outbreak (also related by health investigators to the Taco Bell chain,) at least 155 cases in states across the U.S. have been confirmed. Wisconsin with 26 combined illnesses and Kentucky with 28 are the two leading states for infection. Ohio had 25 cases when the CDC announced the outbreak late last week. 

The CDC officially lists the restaurant chain involved in the outbreaks as Restaurant Chain A, but Oregon&apos;s senior epidemiologist has identified the chain as Taco Bell.

Most people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12–72 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by culture of a stool sample. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections can occur and people should not take it lightly.

Infants, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When severe infection occurs, Salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics

 Taco Bell Salmonella Outbreak Involves Two Rare Types of Salmonella 
 Posted on August 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Taco Bell Salmonella outbreak involving two rare types of the bacterium has sickened 155 people in more than a smattering of states including Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) didn&apos;t identify the restaurant chain by name, but Oregon&apos;s senior epidemiologist, William Keene, confirmed the chain as Taco Bell. Keene told the Oregonian newspaper that the outbreak didn&apos;t involve all Taco Bells and that there&apos;s no reason to stop eating at the chain. 

 Keene said investigators strongly suspect that contaminated lettuce and or tomatoes caused the outbreak , but no one could pin it down. Officially by the CDC&apos;s count, there were at least 75 cases of Salmonella Hartford and at least 80 cases of Salmonella Baildon . More than 50 people were hospitalized, but no one died.

Both Taco Bell Salmonella outbreaks peaked in June and no longer are considered active, but the discussion of liability has just begun.

Law firm Pritzker Olsen is conducting is own investigation of the Taco Bell Salmonella outbreak and is in communication with families impacted by it. To contact a Salmonella lawyer at the firm for a possible Taco Bell lawsuit consultation, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

Leading states for Salmonella Hartford infections were Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. Leading states for Salmonella Baildon infections were Wisconsin and Illinois.

 Salmonella Baildon Outbreak 
 Posted on August 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Update to the post below: The Salmonella Baildon outbreak has been linked to Taco Bell restaurants, according to state and federal health officials. Our law firm has won cases against Taco Bell, and our lawyers are available for a free consultation .

A Salmonella outbreak of two very rare types of the pathogen has spread to 15 states, sickening dozens of victims, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Salmonella Baildon and Salmonella Hartford are two very rare serotypes of Salmonella and are both involved in this outbreak. The CDC reports that a Mexican-style restaurant chain is linked to many of the illnesses, though it has not named the restaurant as a source of the outbreak.
 
Analysis of this study also indicates that eating at Mexican-style fast food Restaurant Chain A was associated with illness. Ill persons (65%) were significantly more likely than well persons (15%) to report eating a restaurant chain A in the week before illness.
 
 Salmonella Baildon Outbreak Investigation 

So far, the CDC has identified 80 people sick with a matching strain of Salmonella Baildon. There are 15 states total involved in the outbreak, with the number of each cases in each state distributed as follows: CT (1), GA (1), IA (1), IL (20), IN (4), KY (5), MA (1), MI (4), MN (5), NJ (6), NY (2), OH (6), OR (1), WA (1) and WI (22)

 These illnesses began being reported in May 2010 Patients range in age from 1 to 82 years old. 27 patients were hospitalized. Ill persons (65%) were significantly more likely than well persons (15%) to report eating a restaurant chain A in the week before illness There were three locations of the Mexican style restaurant where more than one person reported eating in the week before becoming sick. 

&quot;Outbreaks such as this cluster of Salmonella Baildon illnesses can have serious consequences for the victims,&quot;said food poisoning attorney Fred Pritzker .&quot;I have seen these consequences firsthand and it is extremely important that health officials continue to investigate the source of the outbreak.&quot;

 Salmonella Hartford Outbreak Sickens 75 
 Posted on August 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Update to information below : This Salmonella Hartford outbreak has been associated with Taco Bell restaurants, according to health officials.

A multistate Salmonella outbreak is being investigated by public health officials, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced . The outbreak involves two strains of the pathogen: Salmonella Hartford and Salmonella Baildon .

Although no restaurant or food service establishment has been named in connection with the outbreak, the CDC points to a Mexican-style food chain as a possible common link between the illnesses. According to the CDC,&quot;In each study, analysis indicates that eating at a Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain, ... is associated with some illnesses.&quot;

 Salmonella Hartford Outbreak 

So far, the CDC is reporting that 75 people from 15 states have become ill with a matching strain of Salmonella Hartford since early April. The cases are distributed geographically as follows: CO (1), GA (1), IL (5), IN (11), KY (23), MA (2), MI (3), MT (1), NC (1), NH (1), NY (1), OH (19), PA (1), SC (1) and WI (4). Patients range in age from 1 to 80 years old and 15 hospitalizations have so far been reported.

No particular food item was cited as a potential source of the outbreak, but, according to the CDC,&quot;Ill persons (60 %) were significantly more likely than well persons (21%) to report eating at Restaurant Chain A in the week before illness.&quot;Outbreak victims reported eating at 13 different locations of this restaurant chain in the week before their illness and four locations were identified in connection with more than one ill person.

 Two Salmonella Outbreaks Connected to Mexican Style Fast Food Chain 
 Posted on August 4, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Two Salmonella outbreaks associated with a Mexican style fast food chain sickened at least 155 people before both outbreaks fizzled.

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the outbreaks but didn&apos;t identify the restaurant chain that was implicated in food history interviews with victims. Further investigation was unable to pinpoint what type of food or ingredient caused either one of these outbreaks, but the probe is ongoing.
 
 The Salmonella Hartford outbreak sickened 75 people in 15 states, including 32 percent who were hospitalized. The leading states in the outbreak were Kentucky (23 cases), Ohio (19 cases), and Indiana (11 cases). The outbreak peaked in early June. 

 The Salmonella Baildon outbreak sickened 80 people in 15 states, including 27 individuals who were hospitalized. The two leading states were Wisconsin with 22 cases and Illinois with 20 cases. The outbreak peaked in late June. 
 
According to a joint investigation with CDC, FDA and state partners, there were no locations in the restaurant chain common to both strains of Salmonella. Neither outbreak is considered to be ongoing.

 Law firm Pritzker Olsen also is investigating the two outbreaks. If you or a loved one suffered a confirmed Salmonella illness after eating at a Mexican style fast food restaurant, attorneys from our office can provide you with a free case consultation and answer any legal questions you may have about fair compensation.

 The Fort Salmonella Outbreak in Colorado 
 Posted on August 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A Salmonella outbreak linked to The Fort restaurant in Morrison, Colorado, last month sickened upwards of 20 people.

The outbreak was uncovered by CBS4-TV of Denver, which contacted The Fort and the Jefferson County Public Health agency. The restaurant, located 30 miles from downtown Denver, was never shut down.

 Eight confirmed Salmonella cases were matched to the outbreak strain, which also was found in batter made with eggs contaminated with the outbreak strain of Salmonella . CBS4 reported that the meal at The Fort that may have made people sick the most was rattlesnake cakes, a signature dish of The Fort that includes eggs.

The Fort is a prominent restaurant where President Clinton once dined with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The restaurant issued a statement to express sympathy to victims and vowed to work closely with health officials to ensure safe food.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella Case Revisited 
 Posted on August 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
On June 17, 2010, ConAgra Foods announced a recall of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice single-serve frozen entrees in connection with a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella. 

 This recall is still in effect because some of the orginally recalled product may remain in consumers&apos; home freezers. The chance of illness from the recalled Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice entres has not changed 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 29 people in 14 states already were sick with the identical strain of Salmonella Chester when the outbreak and recall were announced. Had ConAgra been slow to heed a phone call from CDC&apos;s foodborne outbreak chief, Ian Williams, many more people would have been infected.

The latest entry in CDC&apos;s Public Health Matters Blog discusses the fact that food manufacturers aren&apos;t always quick to initiate recalls when agencies call to report the likelihood of a link between an outbreak and their product.

But in the case of the Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella outbreak, Williams and ConAgra&apos;s global chief quality officer knew each other from food safety conferences. The recall was announced even before CDC had laboratory confirmation of the outbreak strain of Salmonella from a previously unopened box of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and Rice.

As the situation exists today, there is still a chance some consumers could fall ill from the bacteria if they pull the product from their freezers at home, unaware of the recall. Law firm Pritzker Olsen is continuing to accept cases from this outbreak and it is not too late to file a claim depending on the circumstances.

 CDC on MiceDirect Salmonella Outbreak GA WI IL MA MO NC NY AL AZ CO WY 
 Posted on August 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Thirty-four people in 17 states have been sickened in the MiceDirect Salmonella outbreak that came to light in the U.S. with MiceDirect&apos;s July 23 recall of frozen mice and other reptile food.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced its investigation late yesterday with results of testing on patients and with an epidemiological study that has suggested an association between the outbreak and handling of frozen mice as reptile feed.

Six percent of patients confirmed to be infected with the MiceDirect outbreak strain of Salmonella have been hospitalized, but there have been no deaths. The illnesses confirmed by CDC have onsets dating to December 2009, but the same strain of Salmonella was reported in MiceDirect customers in Britain earlier in 2009. 

Law firm Pritzker Olsen is conducting its own investigation of the outbreak and is in communication with families affected by the snake feed outbreak. To contact a Salmonella attorney for a free case consultation and answers to legal questions, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

Pritzker Olsen is a leading national practitioner of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for our clients. The firm is actively involved in efforts to curb outbreaks of Salmonella and other human pathogens. We represent food poisoning victims in practically all major outbreaks investigated by CDC.

 MiceDirect is based in Cleveland, Georgia, and its parent company is Biggers&amp;Callaham LLC. 

 Recall Information : The frozen reptile feed was distributed in all states, except Hawaii, through pet stores and by mail order and direct delivery.

Frozen mice and other reptile feed was shipped in plastic bags with the following product codes M-SP100, M-P100, M-PF100, M-F100, M-H100, M-W50, M-A50, M-JA25, R-P100, R-F50, R-PUP50, R-W50, R-S50, R-M20, R-L10,R-J5, R-C5, R-M3 followed by E9, F9, G9, H9, I9, J9, K9, L9 or A10, B10, C10, D10, E10, F10, G10 and whole frozen chicks in 25 count bags. 

 The number of ill persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AL (1), AZ (1), CO (1), GA (7), IA (1), IL (3), MA (3), MI (1), MO (3), NC (3), NV (1), NY (2), SC (1), TN (1), VA (1), WI (3), and WY (1).

 MiceDirect Salmonella Began in Britain 
 Posted on July 30, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Mice Direct Salmonella outbreak caused by contaminated frozen mice sold to snake and other reptile owners in the United States was preceded by a Salmonella outbreak in Britiain associated with the same supplier.

The New York Times reported the link, saying that more than 400 people in all have fallen ill in Britain since August 2008. About two-thirds of victims have been children under 10, according to Chris Lane, a senior epidemiologist of the Health Protection Agency’s Center for Infections in London. 

Although the shipments of tainted mice were halted last year, people continue to get sick there, Mr. Lane said. Many of the victims are snake owners.

According to the Times, the first case in the United States appeared in January 2010. Dr. Barton Behravesh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more than 30 cases have been identified in 17 states. It is the strain of Salmonella as the British outbreak. She said the cases were not concentrated in one region but spread across the country. Half the victims were under 12.
 
 The Times story said U.S. authorities were slow to react. to indications of the outbreak. Kristen Nordlund of CDC said British officials told the agency in May 2009 of the outbreak there and the connection to MiceDirect .
 
The parent company of MiceDirect, Biggers&amp;Callaham LLC, is now recalling froze mice, rats and chicks because they have the potential to be contaminated with  Salmonella . The announcement was made earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration.

  The frozen reptile feed was distributed in all states,  except Hawaii, through pet stores and by mail order and direct delivery.

Frozen reptile feed was shipped in plastic bags with the following product codes M-SP100, M-P100, M-PF100, M-F100, M-H100, M-W50, M-A50, M-JA25, R-P100, R-F50, R-PUP50, R-W50, R-S50, R-M20, R-L10,R-J5, R-C5, R-M3 followed by E9, F9, G9, H9, I9, J9, K9, L9 or A10, B10, C10, D10, E10, F10, G10 and whole frozen chicks in 25 count bags.

 If you or someone you know has been sickened after handling reptile feed in this Mice Direct  Salmonella  outbreak, contact your physician immediately for care and request that a stool culture be taken. For legal questions about potential compensation, call  Pritzker Olsen law firm  at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Mice Direct Reptile Feed Salmonella 
 Posted on July 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that human illnesses reported in 17 states may be related to frozen reptile feed now under recall by Mice Direct of Cleveland, Georgia.

The parent company, Biggers&amp;Callaham LLC, is recalling froze mice, rats and chicks because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella . There is a risk people who handle the dead animals can become infected with Salmonella, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands. 

The FDA didn&apos;t say how many people are potentially sick from the contamination. The recall is based upon sampling by the FDA of frozen mice.

 Food Safety at Pro Stadiums Questioned by ESPN Report 
 Posted on July 27, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
An ESPN review of stadium food at all 107 North American arenas for major league baseball, football, hockey and basketball found a high number of serious health violations.

The sports network&apos;s check of 2009 food safety records found 30 stadiums where more than half of the concession stands or restaurants had been cited for at least one&quot;critical&quot;or &quot;major&quot;health violation.&quot;Such violations pose a risk for foodborne illnesses that can make someone sick, or, in extreme cases, become fatal.&apos;&apos; 

 One of the worst venues for reported trouble was Tropicana Field in Florida -- home of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. ESPN reported that every one of the stadium&apos;s 47 food and drink outlets inspected incurred a critical violation within the previous year. Violations included food residue in a cooler, toxic chemicals stored too close to food preparation areas,&quot;slime&quot;in the ice machines and thermometers not readily visible to measure the temperature of hot foods.

Other venues with low marks for food safety were stadiums that house the Miami Heat, Miami Dolphins and the Washington Wizards and Capitals.

Among the best were venues for: the Anaheim Ducks, Toronto Raptors and Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, New England Patriots and New York Islanders.

Among the more startling reports:

 Green Bay Packers&apos; Lambeau Field: Two locations were cited after an employee&quot;did not wash hands after blowing nose or eating food prior to handling customer food or ice.&quot;  Phoenix Suns&apos; US Airways Center: Dozens of flies and a live roach in a dish room.  Denver Broncos&apos; Mile High Stadium: Fruit flies in whiskey bottles at three bars.  Miami Dolphins&apos; Sun Life Stadium: Employee reported small insects and other debris blended into frozen alcoholic drinks.

 Salsa Guacamole Salmonella in Iowa 
 Posted on July 26, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Salsa, guacamole and uncooked tamales made by La Reyna Supermarket and Taqueria of Iowa City may be the source of a Salmonella outbreak traced to farmers&apos; markets in eastern Iowa.

Recent research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that between1998 and 2008, nearly 1 of every 25 outbreaks associated with restaurants or delis may have been caused by contaminated salsa or guacamole.
 The most common infection was norovirus, followed by Salmonella, Shigella , E. coli , and other less common germs. And in 30 percent of the outbreaks, local investigators reported that the salsa or guacamole wasn’t stored or refrigerated properly.   The Linn and Johnson County Public Health Departments are providing a public notice not to consume guacamole, salsa and uncooked tamales prepared by La Reyna prior to July 19. The products of concern were sold at markets in Linn, Johnson and Dubuque counties.   If you or a loved one has been sickened after eating La Reyna salsa, guacamole or tamales, contact a physician immediately for care and request a stool culture to check for the outbreak strain of Salmonella.   If you have legal questions about compensation for harms suffered from commercially purchased contaminated food, contact law firm Pritzker Olsen  at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.   Our firm is one of the nation&apos;s leading practitioners of foodborne illness litigation and we have won millions for our clients.  Tags: Iowa Salmonella , La Reyna , Salmonella , Salmonella Lawsuit , Salmonella Outbreak Recall , guacamole , salsa

 La Reyna Salmonella Outbreak IA May Involve Salsa, Guacamole and Tamales 
 Posted on July 24, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
La Reyna guacamole, salsa and tamales may be the cause of an Iowa Salmonella outbreak that has sickened customers of several farmers markets in the eastern part of the state.

 The Johnson and Linn county health departments have warned Iowans not to eat salsa, gaucamole or uncooked tamales made by La Reyna Supermarket&amp;Taqueria of Iowa City prior to July 19.

The products of concern were sold at the following locations:

 Iowa City Hy-Vee, 1720 Waterfront Drive; Iowa City Farmers Market; Iowa City Jazz Festival; New Pioneer Coop, 22 South Van Buren St., Iowa City and 1101 2nd St., Coralville; Johnson County Farmers Markets at Sycamore Mall, Coralville and Iowa City; Linn County Farmers Markets at Noelridge; Downtown Cedar Rapids and Marion; and the Dubuque Farmer’s Market.  

An ongoing investigation by Johnson and Linn County Public Health officials indicates the guacamole, salsa and uncooked tamales made by La Reyna and sold at eastern Iowa farmer’s markets, festivals, and other distribution sites, may be the source of the illness, said a joint news release from the two counties. 

Up to 25 people in several counties may have been ill in connection with the investigation. So far, eight cases are lab-confirmed.

If you or a loved one are suffering gastrointestinal illness after recently eating LaReyna guacamole, salsa or tamales, see a physician immediately for care and request that a stool culture be taken to test for the outbreak strain of Salmonella .

 Kenosha&apos;s Baker Street Restaurant Reopens After Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 20, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Kenosha&apos;s Baker Street restaurant has reopened after being closed by the Kenosha County Health Department in response to a Salmonella outbreak.   Baker Street was closed for a week after many patrons were found to be among 28 people who tested positive for the same strain of Salmonella.   Diane Bosovich, assistant director of nursing for the health department, told the Kenosha News that testing of employees for Salmonella cleared the restaurant for reopening. She said health investigators were not able to pinpoint the source of the infections.   Salmonella is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne outbreaks in the United States and approximately half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings.

 Tall Ship Niagara Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Twenty-six crew members of the U.S. Flagship Niagara were victims of a Salmonella outbreak while the ship was in Cleveland.

 The Erie Times-News reported the Niagara Salmonella outbreak, saying it affected 26 of 42 crew members. The newspaper reported that most of the crew members were feeling well enough to depart the Tall Ship&apos;s home port of Erie, Pennsylvania, for a Great Lakes tour to Duluth, Minnesota, with stops in Green Bay, Wisconsin; and Chicago.

The source of the information was Bill Sutton, executive director of the Flagship Niagara League, the ship&apos;s fundraising arm. The story didn&apos;t say which health agency confirmed the Salmonella outbreak or whether anyone was hospitalized.

&quot;Everybody&apos;s pretty much back to par,&apos;&apos; Sutton said.

If you are a crew member sickened in this outbreak, law firm Pritzker Olsen can provide you with a free case consultation and answer your legal questions about possible compensation. Call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Bullock&apos;s NC Bar-B-Que Salmonella Summary 
 Posted on July 17, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Sixty-five patrons of Bullock&apos;s Bar-B-Que Restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, were sickened by Salmonella enteritidis believed to be present in meringue on dessert items.

 

 

 

That is the conclusion of an epidemiological study by the Durham County Health Department assisted by several state agencies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified similar outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis in other locations throughout the country.
 
  In all the outbreaks, including the Bullock&apos;s outbreak, the food item implicated in food history surveys was commercially distributed pasteurized egg whites, sold by the same restaurant supplier, and manufactured in the same plant as the product delivered to Bullock’s Restaurant. 
 
However, neither the CDC nor officials in North Carolina have identified the maker of the egg whites. At least in the case of the Bullock&apos;s Restaurant Salmonella outbreak , lab testing of egg whites could not directly prove that this wholesale ingredient was definitively contaminated with Salmonella .

The North Carolina Bar-B-Que Salmonella outbreak at Bullock&apos;s at 3330 Quebec Drive in Durham happened from April 20 - 24. If you or a loved one was sickened in this outbreak and have legal questions about compensation owed to you, contact law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

Our firm has years of experience with liability law pertaining to restaurants in outbreaks of foodborne illness. Restaurants have an obligation to serve safe food to you that is free of pathogens from any ingredient, piece of equipment or employee.

 Kenosha County Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 15, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
26 cases of Salmonella have been confirmed in Kenosha County and a restaurant has temporarily shut down, but health officials have not announced an association between the Salmonella outbreak and the restaurant closing.

The closed restaurant is Baker Street Restaurant&amp;Pub in Kenosha. 

Tom Stemple, an employee of Baker Street, told Kenosha News that several diners reported ill after eating at the restaurant. In addition, Stemple said the owner has asked employees to get tested for bacterial infection.

As of late Thursday, the Kenosha County Health Department had made no announcement about the cause of the outbreak.

 CDC Warns that Salsa and Guacamole are Big Agents of Food Poisoning 
 Posted on July 12, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
New research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should put restaurants on notice to be extra careful in preparing and serving salsa and guacamole to avoid food poisoning.

From 1984 to 2008, restaurants and delis were the settings for 84 percent of the 136 salsa or guacamole-associated (SGA) outbreaks of foodborne disease recorded by CDC.

 According to the research, salsa and guacamole-associated outbreaks accounted for 1.5 percent of all food establishment outbreaks from 1984 to 1997. This figure more than doubled to 3.9 percent during the ten-year period from 1998 to 2008.
 Magdalena Kendall of Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education collaborated on the CDC study. She told scientists at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases that salsa and guacamole often contain diced raw produce including hot peppers, tomatoes and cilantro, each of which has been implicated in past outbreaks.   In addition, unsafe storage times or temperatures were reported in 30 percent of the SGA outbreaks in restaurants or delis. Food workers were reported as the source of contamination in 20 percent of the restaurant outbreaks.  Said Kendall:  &quot;Awareness that salsa and guacamole can transmit foodborne illness, particularly in restaurants, is key to preventing future outbreaks.&quot;    If you or a loved one has been sickened at a restaurant with foodborne illness, see a physician immediately and request that a stool culture be taken. For answers to legal questions, call law firm Pritzker Olsen  at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or use the contact form on the side of this Web page to reach us online.   Our firm is a national leader in foodborne illness litigation and we have collected million for victims of food poisoning, including E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter .

 Marie Callender&apos;s Food Poisoning Update 
 Posted on June 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 On June 17, ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods, LLC first announced a recall of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and&amp;Rice frozen entrées due to possible contamination with Salmonella Chester. Since then, CDC has confirmed that 37 people from 18 states have been infected with a matching strain of Salmonella Chester since April 11, 2010. The number of ill people identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK (1), CA (5), CO (2), GA (7), IL (1), KY (1), MA (2), MN (2), MO (1), NC (1), OK (1), OR (2), SC (2), TN (1), TX (1), UT (2), VA (4), and WA (1).

People sickened in this outbreak range in age from&lt;1 to 88 years old, and the median age is 36 years. Fifty-five percent of patients are female.

Investigation and Smoking Gun

During June 14-18, 2010, CDC and public health officials in multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by 19 ill and 22 well persons. 89 percent of the ill people at a Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meal. Many of the ill persons reported eating a Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and&amp;Rice frozen entrée in the week before becoming ill.

On June 18, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory announced it had isolated Salmonella Chester from an unopened package of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice single-serve frozen entrée collected from the home of one of the ill people. The DNA fingerprint of the isolate matches the outbreak strain. Because of the genetic match, this is the smoking gun.

We provide more information about this outbreak, food poisoning litigation and a ConAgra lawsuit on our website, www.pritzkerlaw.com .

 Skokie Country Club Salmonella Sickens Seven in Glencoe, Illinois 
 Posted on June 26, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
At least seven people who ate at the Skokie Country Club in Glencoe, Illnois have contracted Salmonella infections (salmonellosis), according to the Cook County Department of Public Health. The food source of the outbreak has not been determined.

Even if food arrives at a restaurant already contaminated with Salmonella or another foodborne pathogen, the restaurant is liable for any illnesses caused by the food if the restaurant serves it.

In addition, people who get Salmonella food poisoning from a restaurant have a claim against the restaurant for money damages even if the food source of the outbreak is not found. Our law firm recently represented several people who ate at a restaurant and contracted salmonellosis . The food that made them sick had been consumed and thrown away, so the food source of the outbreak could not be determined. Our lawyers still won the case.

 Illinois Subway Salmonella Victim Represented by Pritzker Olsen 
 Posted on June 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A woman from central Illinois who was hospitalized in the Illinois Subway restaurant   outbreak has retained law firm Pritzker Olsen to represent her in Subway Salmonella litigation. 
 The 52-year-old resident of Tazewell County is one of at least 97 people who have tested positive for the same strain of Salmonella Hvittingfoss in an outbreak linked to more than 40 Subway locations in 28 Illinois counties.   Pritzker Olsen is in contact with other victims and continues to accept cases for an Illinois Subway Salmonella lawsuit.  To contact the firm call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the online contact form on the right side of this Web page.   Fred Pritzker , founder and president of Pritzker Olsen, said the client ate an oven-roasted chicken sub on May 11 at the Subway on 603 Jackson Street in Morton, Illinois. She was hospitalized for several days after suffering gastroenteritis and cramping with severe vomiting. “This outbreak emphasizes the importance of proper restaurant training, including an emphasis on thorough hand washing,’’Pritzker said.“There has been an unacceptable gap in food safety.’’ Pritzker said restaurant outbreaks of foodborne pathogens should automatically trigger testing of employees, regardless of their illness history. In the Illinois Subway outbreak, state health officials have found food handlers at some restaurant locations who have tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella.   The state is now requiring Subway food handlers linked to the outbreak to have two consecutive test results that are negative before returning to work. There are fears of a secondary outbreak because food handlers can inadvertently pass the bacteria to restaurant patrons, causing them to become sick.   Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, older adults and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In some cases, the organism can get into the bloodstream and produce arterial infections such as endocarditis and reactive arthritis, or Reiter’s syndrome.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella Case Highlights Poisoning in Frozen Food 
 Posted on June 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Thirty people in 15 states have been confirmed as victims of the Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and Rice Salmonella Chester   outbreak being investigated by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with state partners.

The number of people sickened by this outbreak is likely to grow and CDC said it is possible other frozen food products may be found to be contaminated. More information is expected this week.

 Frozen, not-ready-to-eat microwavable meals have been reported previously as vehicles in salmonellosis outbreaks. A common problem is that manufacturers don&apos;t pre-cook all ingredients and sometimes are sloppy in providing at-home cooking instructions on the package.

Law firm Pritzker Olsen has experience in these types of cases. If you are among those sickened in the Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella recall and outbreak, contact us at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the right side of this Web page. We are a national leaders in foodborne illness litigation and have collected millions for victims of food poisoning.

 Frozen Dinners and Salmonella 

Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meals are made by ConAgra Foods. The same company was involved in the 2007 Salmonella outbreak linked to Banquet brand frozen pot pies. More than 400 people were sickened in the Banquet pot pie outbreak in 41 states. A third of the sick were hospitalized.

CDC noted in a followup study that the Banquet pot pie Salmonella outbreak highlighted the need to cook not-ready-to-eat frozen foods thoroughly. &quot;These products should be clearly labeled as requiring complete cooking, and cooking instructions should be validated to account for variability in microwave wattage and common misconceptions among consumers regarding the nature of not-ready-to-eat foods,&apos;&apos; CDC wrote. 

In the current Salmonella outbreak involving packages of Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice, vegetables and some other ingredients were not cooked prior to packaging, but the chicken was. That&apos;s what ConAgra spokeswoman Teresa Paulsen told CIDRAP News.

For consumers, CDC recommends for food safety reasons that frozen dinners be cooked in convetional ovens for thorough and even cooking.

 If you choose to cook frozen dinners using a microwave, the health agency reminds consumers to cook the food for the time specified for your microwave&apos;s wattage. Let the food&quot;stand&quot;for the stated time so cooking can continue. The CDC also recommends use of a food thermometer to make sure that it is fully cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

 Illinois Targets Subway Sandwich Makers in Salmonella Hvittingfoss Probe 
 Posted on June 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is taking steps to prevent a secondary outbreak of Salmonella Hvittingfoss tied to Subway restaurants in 28 Illinois counties.

The health agency is now requiring Subway workers in 46 restaurants associated with the outbreak to be tested and cleared before returning to work. IDPH said in a press release that several food handlers at certain Subway restaurants in Illinois have tested positive for Salmonella Hvittingfoss. 

 The fear is that they will contaminate others and the outbreak will continue to spread. The demand of the health department is that infected workers have two consecutive test results that are negative for Salmonella serotype Hvittingfoss before being allowed to return to work.

 The Subway Salmonella outbreak has now sickened 90 people in 28 counties , including 25 people who have been hospitalized.

Illness onsets have been reported between May 5 and June 4. Victims range in age from 2 to 79.

Case patients have reported eating at Subway restaurants located in these counties -- Bureau, Cass, Champaign, Christian, Coles, Dekalb, DeWitt, Ford, Fulton, Henry, Knox, LaSalle, Livingston, Macon, Marshall, McLean, Moultrie, Ogle, Peoria, Rock Island, Sangamon, Schuyler, Shelby, Tazewell, Vermilion, Warren, Will and Winnebago.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak Update 
 Posted on June 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 More evidence of a multi-state Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella outbreak has been uncovered by the Minnesota Department of Health.

The agency reported finding Salmonella Chester in a previously unopened Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meal from the home of a case patient. That patient is one of at least two people sickened in Minnesota as part of the outbreak. The bacteria is being tested to see if it matches the outbreak strain. 

 Pritzker Olsen law firm is closely following the research and conducting its own investigation. If you or a loved one has suffered diarrhea and stomach cramps after eating a Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meal, contact a physician immediately and ask for a stool culture to be taken.

For answers to legal questions about possible compensation, call Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the online contact form on the right side of this Web page. We are seeking direct contact with victims of this outbreak -- which is likely to grow beyond its current status of 30 illnesses in 15 states.

Our firm is a national leader in foodborne illness litigation and we are involved on the side of victims in practically every major outbreak of foodborne illness, recovering millions for survivors of food poisoning.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Recall Information 

ConAgra Foods, which has operations in Council Bluffs, Iowa, has announced a nationwide recall of Marie Callender’s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice single-serve frozen entrees. All packages, regardless of date, are covered by the recall. The company said the Marie Callender&apos;s recall was announced in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigation of the Salmonella Chester outbreak.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Salmonella Chester Investigation 

 According to the CDC, the number of ill people identified in each state with this strain is as follows: CA (4), CO (2), GA (6), IL (1), KY (1), MA (2), MN (2), MO (1), NC (1), OK (1), OR (2), SC (2), TN (1), UT (1), and VA (3).

Case patients range in age from less than 1 to 88 with a median age of 37. Among 15 victims with available information, six were hospitalized. Illnesses began between April 5 and May 29, but could still be occurring.

Food history interviews were conducted with 14 ill and 21 well persons. Among the ill, 86 percent reported eating a frozen meal and 100 percent who reported eating a frozen meal said it was a Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meal. &quot;Preliminary analysis of this study suggests eating a Marie Callender’s frozen meal as a possible source of illness.&apos;&apos; 

This map show the number of known cases per state. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases and identify the contaminated product or products that are causing illness.

 A ConAgra spokeswoman told CIDRAP News that many meal components, including chicken, are pre-cooked during the manufacturing process. But others are not, including vegetables. Consumers are reminded by this outbreak to thoroughly cook all frozen meals purchased in grocery stores.

 Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken Salmonella Link Studied by Health Investigators 
 Posted on June 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
State and federal health officials believe a Marie Callender&apos;s frozen meal could be the cause of a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella  Chester with 29 confirmed cases in 14 states.

 A Class I consumer recall has been issued for all packages of Marie Callender&apos;s&quot;Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice White Meat Chicken and Broccoli over Rice Topped with Rich Cheddar Sauce.&apos;&apos; The product is made by ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods LLC of Council Bluffs, Iowa.

This is a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death and it is not to be taken lightly.

According to a joint investigation led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), eight of the case patients specifically reported eating this product in April and May, 2010, prior to illness onset. The last reported illness was reported on May 22. 

It is a strong epidemiological link, yet health investigators are still attempting to definitively identify the food vehicle responsible for this outbreak of Salmonella Chester.

 If you or a loved one has been sickened in this Salmonella Chester outbreak associated with Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and Rice, contact law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the far right side of this Web page.

If you have suffered diarrhea and painful stomach cramping after eating a ConAgra Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken and Rice meal, contact your physician for a possible stool sample culture to confirm whether you are a victim of this outbreak.

Once again, the recall is for all 16-ounce packages of&quot;Marie Callender&apos;s Cheesy Chicken&amp;Rice White Meat Chicken and Broccoli over Rice Topped with Rich Cheddar Sauce.&quot; Each package bears a label with establishment number&quot;P-45&quot;inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were distributed to retail establishments nationwide.

 Subway Salmonella Outbreak Update 
 Posted on June 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Illinois health officials have confirmed 71 illnesses in the Subway Salmonella Outbreak involving Subway restaurants in 22 Illinois counties.

According to news reports, 26 people have been hospitalized and there have been no deaths.

The Illinois Department of Public Health encourages anyone experiencing gastrointestinal illness after eating at Subway restaurants in Illinois on or after May 10, to contact their health care provider or local health department. 

For answers to legal questions about a possible Subway Salmonella lawsuit, call food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.. Our firm is currently in direct contact with victims of the outbreak and we have been conducting our own investigaiton, as we do in many outbreaks.

We are presently litigating a food poisoning lawsuit against an Illinois Subway store on behalf of a woman from DuPage County who became quite sick after eating a veggie sandwich from the location on East Roosevelt Road in Lombard, Ill.

Our client couldn&apos;t eat for several days and missed two weeks of work. She had a stool-culture confirmed case of foodborne illness.

So far, outbreak victims have reported eating at Subway restaurants located in Bureau, Cass, Champaign, Christian, Coles, Dewitt, Fulton, Knox, La Salle, Macon, Marshall, Moultrie, Ogle, Peoria, Sangamon, Schuyler, Shelby, Tazewell, Vermilion, Warren, Winnebago, and Wil counties. 

 Salmonella is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne outbreaks in the United States; approximately half of all Salmonella outbreaks occur in restaurant settings.

But that doesn&apos;t mean families should take Salmonella infection lightly.  The organism can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.

Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, Salmonellosis can result in the bacteria getting into the bloodstream and produce arterial infections, endocarditis and reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.

 More Victims in Illinois Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on June 7, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The central and downstate Illinois Salmonella outbreak associated with Subway restaurants has grown from 34 to 48 cases.

Today&apos;s update on the Subway Salmonella  outbreak came from the Illinois Department of Public Health. The agency said 17 outbreak victims have been hospitalized with infections of a rare Salmonella strain known as Hvittingfoss. 

The outbreak involves people who reported eating at Subway locations in 18 Illinois counties. The grouping includes Bureau, Cass, Champaign, Christian, Coles, Fulton, LaSalle, Macon, Marshall, Moultrie, Ogle, Peoria, Sangamon, Schuyler, Shelby, Tazewell, Warren, and Will. 

Illnesses are reported to have started between May 11 and May 25 and cases range in age from three to 88-years-old. So far, a specific food source has not been identified as the source, but epidemiologists found a strong correlation between illness and eating at Subways in certain Illinois counties..

 Downstate Counties Probe Salmonella Outbreak Tied to Subway Restaurants 
 Posted on June 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Subway customers in downstate Illinois who recently became sick within seven days after eating at one of the restaurants are being asked to contact your county health department or Illinois State Department of Health if you or your doctor haven&apos;t already done so.

The investigators are seeking information to help pinpoint the cause of a Salmonella outbreak associated with Subway restaurants in 14 counties. The Subway outbreak has sickened at least 34 people, including 14 who have been hospitalized.

 The Subway Salmonella outbreak in downstate Illinois involves a rare strain of the bacteria known as Hvittingfoss.

Dianna Heyer, the Macon County Health Department&apos;s nursing services coordinator, told a local newspaper that in Macon County there have been three laboratory-confirmed cases.

WIFR.com reported that Ogle County has at least two reported cases. Candy Johnstone told the station that she is one of those victims.

Jonstone told WIFR that she ate a veggie sub at a Rochelle Subway about three weeks ago. That&apos;s when illnesses were first starting to be reported.
 
 &quot;I was either sleeping or in the bathroom. It was just terrible pains, and by Sunday I realized it was worse than a flu or common cold or something so I went to the emergency room,&quot;Johnstone said. 
 
Food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is accepting cases from the Salmonella Subway outbreak in Illinois. Call a Salmonella lawyer at the firm at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page. We will respond with a free case consultation.

 Already this year our firm has filed an Illinois lawsuit against Subway on behalf of a woman who suffered food poisoning after eating at the Subway on East Roosevelt Road in Lombard. That outbreak was separate from the current one.

In the Lombard Subway case, our lawsuit states that the client could not eat food for several days and missed two weeks of work.

Consequences of Salmonella  infection vary, but it is not something to take lightly. In some cases, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing arterial infections and reactive arthritis, or Reiter&apos;s Syndrome, which can lead to heart problems.

This form of food poisoning is most threatening to young children, the elderly and other who have weakened or under-developed immune systems.

 Posted on June 4, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) on a California alfalfa sprouts Salmonella outbreak indicates the number of ill people has grown by seven, including one case in Pennsylvania.

The CDC says Caldwell&apos;s facility is still under investigation. The company made a recall stemming from the public health investigation of illnesses that first started to appear March 1.

Including the latest case, which was reported May 16, the Salmonella sprouts outbreak has infected individuals in 11 states. Seven of the victims have been hospitalized.

A sizable portion of recalled sprouts were sold at Wal-Mart and Trader Joe&apos;s stores, the CDC said.

 Salmonella Newport Outbreak Linked to Alfalfa Sprouts 
 Posted on May 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A multistate Salmonella serotype Newport outbreak is being investigated in connection with raw alfalfa sprouts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . The CDC is conducting the investigation in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The outbreak has so far sickened 28 people with matching strains of this type of Salmonella infection in 10 different states. Victims range in age from younger than one year old to 75 years old and 32 is the median age. Cases are distributed throughout the ten states as follows: AZ (2), CA (14), CO (1), ID (3), IL (1), MO (1), NM (1), NV (2), OR (1), and WI (2)

According to the CDC announcement:
 
&quot;Interviews of case-patients found that most reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts before becoming ill. Some case-patients reported eating sprouts at restaurants; others purchased sprouts at grocery stores. The initial investigation traced the implicated raw alfalfa sprouts to a single sprout processor in California . Investigations are currently ongoing at the sprout processor.&quot;
 
Because of Salmonella contamination concerns, a raw alfalfa sprouts recall was announced by Caldwell Fresh Foods on May 21. The recalled sprouts were sold under several brand names and were sold at 400 Walmart stores in 15 states.They were also sold at Trader Joe&apos;s

 

Safe Consumption of Sprouts: Avoid Food Poisoning

 

Health officials advise that children, pregnant women, people with weak immune systems and the elderly NOT CONSUME raw sprouts, as they can be a particular risky source of bacteria due to the warm, moist environments in which they are grown. This includes other types of sprouts in addition to alfalfa sprouts, such as mung bean sprouts, clover sprouts and radish sprouts. Cooking the sprouts makes them safer to eat because it can kill potentially harmful bacteria such as Salmonella.

Consumers can also protect themselves by requesting that raw sprouts NOT be added to dishes in restaurants or delis.

 California Sprouts Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on May 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an urgent nationwide alfalfa sprouts recall linked to an outbreak of Salmonella in 10 states .

California is hit hardest by this outbreak, with half of the 22 confirmed alfalfa sprout Salmonella Newport   illnesses happening within the borders of the Golden State. 

For example, three California alfalfa Salmonella cases have been confirmed in San Diego County. Health officials in the county say the only stores affected there are Trader Joe’s. They believe the products have already been pulled from the shelves but are checking with the stores to be sure.

According to the California Department of Public Health , the following products have been recalled:

 Caldwell Fresh Foods–four ounce plastic cups and one pound plastic bags; two pound and five pound plastic bags in cardboard boxes with a Caldwell Fresh Foods stickers. Nature’s Choice–four ounce plastic cups. California Fresh Exotics Brand–five ounce plastic clamshell container. 

Caldwell Fresh Foods is a business located in Maywood, California. The FDA&apos;s alfalfa alert says that all consumers and restaurant/delicatessen operators should immediately stop using Caldwell Fresh Foods raw alfalfa sprouts.

Besides California, the other states involved so far in the sprouts Salmonella outbreak are  Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Wisconsin.

 Salmonella Alfalfa Sprouts a Chronic Probelm 
 Posted on May 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
One years ago the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was warning the public about a Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak linked to raw alfalfa sprouts that sickened 235 people in 14 states, including at least seven who were hospitalized.

 In that outbreak, investigators believed growers&apos; seeds were contaminated, causing a widespread problem. The Salmonella situation with sprouts is chronic and repeated outbreaks have prompted health officials to perpetually warn that they not be eaten by small children, the elderly or others with compromised immune systems.

Yesterday the FDA announced the latest outbreak -- a strain of Salmonella Newport in sprouts that has infected at least 22 people in 10 states between March 1 and May 20. Infections have been confirmed in Arizona (1), California (11), Colorado (1), Idaho (1), Illinois (1), Missouri (1), New Mexico (1), Nevada (2), Oregon (1), and Wisconsin (2).

Six of those sickened have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported. The Oregon victim of this outbreak is an infant.

The raw sprouts Salmonella outbreak has been associated with  Caldwell Fresh Foods of Maywood, Calif. The company is recalling all of its alfalfa sprouts marketed under the Caldwell Fresh Foods, Nature’s Choice, and California Exotics brands. 

The sprouts were distributed to Trader Joe&apos;s and Wal-Mart stores, other retailers and a variety of restaurants and delicatessens.

In Oregon, where the current Caldwell Salmonella sprouts outbreak was first announced, state epidemiologist Dr. William E. Keene, says there have been 12 outbreaks related to raw sprouts since 1995.

By the count of Dr. Douglas Powell, associate professor of food safety at Kansas State University, there have been at least 38 sprout-related outbreaks since 1990 in the U.S. and Canada.

 Most Salmonella infections cause diarrhea, fever and stomach pain that are overcome without medical care, but the pathogen is not to be taken lightly and can be life-threatening in individuals who have weakened immune capability. 

In almost every large outbreak of Salmonella there are instances of Reiter&apos;s Syndrome developing from infection. Reiter&apos;s Syndrome also is known as reactive arthritis and it causes joint pain and also can lead to serious heart problems. People with Reiter&apos;s Syndrome often report having painful urination.

 If you have been sickened after eating alfalfa sprouts, you may have a claim for compensation against the grower, processors, retailers, distributors, a restaurant or other eating establishment. 

 For answers to such legal questions, contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Caldwell Foods Salmonella Alfalfa Sprouts Outbreak 
 Posted on May 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Salmonella outbreak associated with Caldwell Fresh Foods alfalfa sprouts has so far sickened 20 in 10 states and hospitalized four, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced .

Caldwell Fresh Foods has recalled the following products, which include two other brand names:

 Caldwell Fresh Foods - 4-ounce plastic cups and one pound plastic bags, and 2-pound and 5 pound plastic bags in cardboard boxes with sticker affixed with the printed words Caldwell Fresh Foods. Nature&apos;s Choice - 4-ounce plastic cups California Exotics brands - 5-ounce plastic clamshell containers SOLD AT: Various delis and retailers nationwide. In California, locations include: Kings Super Market, Numero Uno Stores, Cárdenas Markets, Trader Joe&apos;s Stores, Gonzalez Northgate Markets, Wal-Mart stores Jons Markets, and Canton Foods 

 

Sprouts Contaminated with Salmonella

 

Sprouted seeds, typically from plants like alfalfa or mung beans, are grown in moist, warm environments where harmful pathogens like Salmonella and E. coli can thrive. In fact, Salmonella outbreaks in the past have been associated with sprouts .

The risk of contamination for sprouts can be so high, in fact, that according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):
 
&quot;The FDA currently advises all consumers to cook sprouts before eating them. And it recommends that the young, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems should not eat sprouts.&quot;
 
The food safety lawyers at Pritzker Olsen law firm have represented victims of Salmonella food poisoning from many types of foods, including peanut butter and pepper. Anyone who suspects they may be sick with salmonella food poisoning should see a doctor immediately and be tested for the pathogen.

 Two Fronts of Raw Milk Disease in Utah 
 Posted on May 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
As Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle decides whether to sign a bill legalizing raw milk sales in Wisconsin, health officials in Utah are dealing with two separate clusters of illness linked to drinking the unpasteurized dairy product.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports that 15 people became ill from Campylobacter and Salmonella stemming from two different state-licensed dairies. 

The nine reported cases of Campylobacter   infection are among residents in Weber, Davis and Cache counties. In Utah, Salt Lake and Wasatch counties, at least six raw milk drinkers have suffered from Salmonella infection .

The information comes from Julia Hall, food-borne epidemiologist for the Utah Department of Health. She told the newspaper that risks of getting disease from raw milk are inherent. Besides Salmonella and Campylobacter, unpasteurized milk can be laden with microscopic E. coli O157:H7 bugs or Listeria without tainting the taste or smell of raw milk.
 
 Said Hall:  &quot;Even with strict state regulations in place, there is no guarantee that raw milk is free of disease-causing bacteria.&quot; 
 
Anyone in Utah who has consumed raw milk in recent days and is experiencing symptoms should contact a health-care provider. For answers to legal questions about bacterial infection from raw milk sold by licensed Utah dairies, call food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page for a free case consultation.

The two Utah raw milk dairies associated with the current outbreaks are as follows:

 For Campylobacter , samples tested positive with high coliform counts from Ropelato Dairy, 4019 W. 1800 South in Ogden. Ropelato&apos;s license to sell raw milk has been suspended, said Larry Lewis, spokesman for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. For Salmonella , investigators have associated the illnesses with Redmond Dairy, in central Utah. Raw milk from the dairy was sold at stores in Heber City and Orem. The dairy&apos;s St. George store was not linked to the outbreak.  
 Redmond manager Brandon Foote said the dairy, which was not sanctioned, has since been testing every batch of milk through a third-party lab. Tags: Raw Milk Campylobacter , Raw Milk Litigation , Salmonella , utah campylobacter , utah salmonella

 Los Dos Amigos Salmonella Outbreak May Have Stemmed From Dirty Hands 
 Posted on May 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Unwashed hands or some other form of cross-contamination is believed to be the cause of a restaurant Salmonella outbreak in Roseburg, Oregon, at Los Dos Amigos.   KMTR News is reporting that the outbreak grew from seven initial illnesses to 30. Those who got sick had dined at the Mexican-style restaurant in downtown Roseburg between April 9-17.   KMTR said the state tested for Salmonella on food prep surfaces at the restaurant, but all test results returned negative.   That means the outbreak most likely resulted from some form of cross-contamination, including the possibility of dirty hands from a sick employee.   The station said  Douglas County Public Health officials have been working with the restaurant for several weeks in the midst of the outbreak investigation to make sure employees follow proper procedures, focusing on hand washing and food storage.   If you or a loved one has been sickened in this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.   This outbreak could have been prevented with food safe kitchen practices and food handling. Instead, people became sick with a pathogen that has the potential to claim lives.  Tags: Restaurant Liability , Salmonella , Salmonella Attorney , Salmonella outbreak , los dos amigos lawsuit

 Utah Confirms Raw Milk Salmonella Link 
 Posted on May 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Salmonella in raw milk from Redmond Heritage Farms in Sevier County, Utah, is a genetic match to the strain of Salmonella Newport that infected at least six people from three different Utah counties.   That&apos;s the result of tests conducted by the Utah Public Health Lab and announced today by Utah County. The samples were tested in conjunction with a state and local investigation of a Salmonella Newport outbreak that was believed to stem from contaminated raw milk sold at Real Foods stores in Orem and Heber, Utah.   News reports have said that Real Foods owns Redmond Heritage Farms. Because of the Salmonella probe, sales were suspended. But the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food recently cleared R edmond to resume sales.   The first illness was reported April 15 in Utah County. Since then, three more cases were confirmed in Utah County and two more were found in Salt Lake and Wasatch counties.   Officials have said the youngest victim was a toddler and the oldest was 56 years old. Officials have said no one appears to have been hospitalized in the outbreak, but  Salmonella is a pathogen that is capable of causing serious injury or death.   Raw or unpasteurized milk is prohibited from public sale in some states because of the inherent risks of infection from Salmonella , Campylobacter and E. coli O157:H7.  Without pasteurization to kill the organisms, they can contaminate fresh milk without degrading the taste or smell of the product.   For answers to legal questions about the Real Foods raw milk Salmonella outbreak, call food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Los Dos Amigos Salmonella Investigation 
 Posted on May 6, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Los Dos Amigos Salmonella outbreak in Roseburg, Oregon, remains under investigation by Douglas County Public Health with tests pending on samples taken from the downtown restaurant.

When the outbreak was first announced April 28, Public Health Division Director Dawnelle Marshall said there were seven confirmed cases of   salmonellosis . Yesterday she reported to KPIC News that the number of Los Dos Amigos Salmonella infections now stands at 17.

Marshall told the news station that sampling is pending and results should be available later in the week. 

&quot;We&apos;ve not been able to pinpoint the source, whether that is a food item, whether there is cross-contamination. We have not been able to do that, but we do have sampling that is pending, and those results should be in later this week,&quot;Marshall said.

Some ill persons have become very sick, requiring hospitalization. Initial investigation results show that people who became ill at Los Dos Amigos Restaurant on Jackson Street between April 9 and April 17.

Food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is monitoring the outbreak and has reviewed Douglas County Public Health restaurant inspection records. Interestingly, the downtown location of Los Dos Amigos had a lower score on its most recent inspection (2010) than it did last year.
 
The score from year to year dropped from 87 to 80 and the number of&quot;critical violations&quot;increased from two to three. Of more than 180 restaurants inspected in Roseburg in 2010, fewer than a dozen had 3 or more&quot;critical violations,&apos;&apos; according to the law firm&apos;s review.
 
 Critical violations are more likely to contribute to food contamination and illness than other violations, according to the county restaurant inspection criteria. These include but are not limited to:

 Personal hygiene is inadequate (hand washing, etc.) Foods held at improper temperatures. Foods are not date-marked or discarded upon expiration.

 Salmonella Death of Nellie Napier Inspires Family to Fight for Food Safety 
 Posted on May 5, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
It has been more than one year since Nellie Napier was taken from her loving family in Ohio by a severe Salmonella infection she contracted from contaminated peanut butter.

 Nellie, who had just recently celebrated her 80th birthday, was one of nine people who died in the Salmonella  Typhimurium outbreak caused by unsafe conditions and practices at the Georgia plant of Peanut Corporation of America.

Law firm Pritzker Olsen represents her family and the families of two other women who died in the outbreak. More than 700 people across the country were sickened by various products made with the contaminated nuts.

The tragedy has inspired Nellie&apos;s family, among others, to work tirelessly for safer food. They have made many lobbying trips to Washington, D.C. and conducted countless media interviews. Inside the Napier family this week there is hope Congress could vote affirmatively before Mother&apos;s Day on food safety legislation they have been pushing for. 

In Nellie&apos;s memory, her children and grandchildren have established a fund to benefit S.T.O.P., Safe Tables Our Priority. S.T.O.P is a great organization that works to prevent illness from food and fights to make sure no one has to be afraid to eat.

Please visit the Napier family&apos;s Web page created in Nellie&apos;s memory. As her family says:&quot;We don’t want anyone else to have to suffer the way she did.&apos;&apos;

 Bullock&apos;s Salmonella Outbreak in Durham 
 Posted on April 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Durham County Health Department is investigating an apparent  Salmonella   outbreak among persons who ate food at Bullock’s Barbecue since April 20, 2010.

Early laboratory results suggest Salmonella as the cause of the illnesses, but further confirmation at the North Carolina State Laboratory is necessary. The restaurant has cooperated with the health department and has conducted the proper disposal and clean-up of potentially affected food items and equipment, the agency said.

 The symptoms of Salmonella infection are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever that can be self-limited or last several days. The symptoms typically begin within 72 hours after an exposure, but some persons may develop illness up to a week after eating contaminated food items or beverages.

Young children, the elderly, and others who have weakened immune systems are at a greater risk for serious illness resulting from Salmonella . One potential long-term health consequence is Reiter&apos;s Syndrome, often referred to as reactive arthritis.

If you or a loved one have eaten food from the restaurant since April 20th with any of the symptoms should contact their primary health care provider and be tested for Salmonella . For answers to legal questions about the outbreak, call law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Hawaii Raw Ahi Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on April 22, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Raw ahi tuna is believed to be the cause of a Salmonella outbreak in Hawaii and the same strain of Salmonella Paratyphi B has infected 13 other people in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New York. 

 The Hawaii State Department of Health announced the outbreak today, saying it has found 10 confirmed cases on Oahu related to eating previously frozen internationally imported raw ahi. The fish often was prepared as poke, a traditional appetizer of cubed raw fish in sauce and seasoning.

As of April 12 there also were 13 confirmed cases of Salmonella infection with the same pattern of Paratyphi B -- seven in California, two in Maryland, two in Pennsylvania, one in Massachusetts and one in New York.

Hawaii is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the other states to identify if those mainland patients were also exposed to raw ahi. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been asked to investigate international sources of frozen ahi tuna.
 
Hawaii Health Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino said there is concern about the similarity between the current outbreak and a cluster of 35 Salmonella Paratyphi B infections confirmed in Hawaii between October 2007 and February 2008.

In that outbreak, the department determined that frozen imported ahi served raw in poke was the probable source of illness. Matching cases of Salmonella infection were found at that time in Colorado and California related to raw fish, but the commercial source of the contaminated tuna could not be traced.
 
 “With the help of the FDA, we hope to identify the source so we can prevent any further illness,&apos;&apos; Fukino said. 

 Salmonella typically causes diarrhea that may be bloody and is often accompanied by abdominal cramps and fever. Symptoms typically begin within one to four days after exposure to the bacteria, although for S. Paratyphi B, incubation may take from five to seven days.

In infants, persons with poor underlying health, and those with weakened immune systems, Salmonella  can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections, including Reiter&apos;s syndrome.  

 If you or a loved one is experiencing these symptoms after eating raw fish, meat or poultry, seek immediate medical attention and ask the doctor to obtain a stool culture. Legal questions about this outbreak are being answered by national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free), or via the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 No Real Progress on Food Poisoning 
 Posted on April 16, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Media reports covering the latest CDC data on food poisoning have focused on a slight decline in the incidence of E. coli O157:H7 infections in 2009.

But the bottom line of the report is that no real progress has been made in six years in reducing dangerous pathogens in our food. 

&quot;The interventions begun in the late 1990s were successful in decreasing some of these foodborne diseases, but we haven’t seen much recent progress,”said Chris Braden, M.D., acting director of CDC’s Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases.“To make additional strides against these diseases and ultimately better protect the American people from foodborne illness, CDC, our federal and state partners, and the food industry will need to try new strategies.&quot;

Braden was commenting on annual CDC surveillance data released this week by FoodNet, a food poisoning detection and reporting system operated by CDC in collaboration from 10 state health departments, USDA and FDA. It tracks E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella , Listeria , Campylobacter , Shigella and four other pathogens. 

For most of the infections, the rate was highest in children under the age of 4 years. People over 50 years old had the highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths from most foodborne illnesses, emphasizing the need for those over 50 to get diagnosed and get treatment quickly after becoming ill.
 
Among the four pathogens tracked in FoodNet that have national incidence goals, Salmonella is furthest from meeting the goal. According to CDC, there is slow progress in fighting Salmonella because it is spread through a wide variety of foods, and also through non foodborne routes. Salmonella can be spread by poultry, meat, eggs, produce and processed foods, as well as by contact with animals like baby chicks, small turtles, reptiles and frogs.
 
 Shigella and E. coli O157:H7 were the two pathogens that experienced lower incidence rates in 2009 when compared to 2006-2008. The Healthy People goal for E. coli was a rate of less than 1 infection per 100,000 people. The 2009 ratio was .57 per 100,000, down 25 percent. For Shigella, the incidence rate was down 27 percent to 3.99 per 100,000.

 Daniele Salami Salmonella Investigation Still Bubbling at CDC, FDA, USDA 
 Posted on April 4, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the process of verifying that the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak  involving contaminated red and black pepper is under control.

Since the agency last reported on the outbreak, very few cases have been added to the total, which now stands at 252 Salmonella Montevideo illnesses in 44 states. There&apos;s another nine cases of Salmonella infections of serotype Senftenberg related to the outbreak, the CDC has said. 

Of 193 patients for which medical treatment information was available, 51 victims have been hospitalized and no one has died.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of this outbreak and is continuing to accept cases. To receive a free case consultation, call a Salmonella lawyer at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page. 

Pritzker Olsen is one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected millions for food poisoning victims. Our firm also is actively involved in efforts to prevent foodborne illness, including supporting tougher legislation in Congress to strengthen the U.S. system of food inspection and regulation.

The CDC said in its latest press release on the Daniele International outbreak that it is still working with the USDA , FDA and state partners to identify the specific products or ingredients that became contaminated and how the contamination occurred. The agencies also are still trying to identify any other food vehicles that may be involved.
 The number of ill persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo is as follows: AK (1), AL (2), AZ (7), CA (31), CO (5), CT (5), DC (1), DE (3), FL (3), GA (3), IA (1), ID (4), IL (23), IN (4), KS (5), LA (1), MA (14), MD (1), ME (1), MI (4), MN (6), MO (2), MS (1), NC (11), ND (1), NE (3), NH (2), NJ (9), NM (2), NY (19), OH (9), OK (1), OR (10), PA (7), RI (2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (5), TX (7), UT (9), VA (1), WA (18), WI (1), WV (1), and WY (2). Sixteen persons were identified who purchased the same type of sliced salami variety pack made by Daniele at different grocery store locations before becoming ill. Three additional ill persons have been identified who purchased a similar type of sliced salami deli tray made by Daniele before becoming ill. These data suggest this product is the source of some of these illnesses, the CDC has said.   Testing by the Rhode Island Department of Public Healt h found the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo in samples of black and red pepper intended for use in the production of Italian-style meats at Daniele International Inc. of Rhode Island. The finding led to recalls by the company&apos;s pepper suppliers, which created a rolling recall by customers of the spice companies.   For the CDC&apos;s complete listing of pepper-related recalls related to the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak, click here .

 Turkey Gravy Salmonella Spoils Minnesota Scout Troop Potluck Dinner 
 Posted on March 29, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Turkey gravy at a Minnesota scout troop potluck dinner was associated with Salmonella   that state health investigators later traced to pet bearded dragons kept by the woman who prepared the gravy and turkeys.

 Nineteen potluck attendees who were interviewed by the Minnesota Department of Health said they became ill and five of the 19 tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella  subspecies IV via stool cultures.

According to a health department report , the probe began curiously in early December after the health agency recognized that three people from two different families were stricken with the same rare strain of Salmonella -- one that is primarily associated with reptile contact.

All three ill persons had been to the scout troop potluck and none reported having any reptile contact.

After investigators interviewed other attendees, they found that the only food item statistically associated with illness was turkey gravy. Further inquiry led to the following discovery:
 
 &quot;The person who prepared the gravy (and turkeys) did so during the 3 days preceding the potluck. She reported having two pet bearded dragons at home. The gravy was never brought to a boil and drippings were added over several days,&apos;&apos; the report said. 
 
Investigators swabbed the home, including the dragons, and found the outbreak strain of Salmonella subspecies IV in the contents of the home&apos;s vacuum cleaner bag. They also determined the dragons&apos; owner was asymptomatically infected.
 
 &quot;The potluck food and potatoes were likely contaminated by either the dragons’owner... or from contaminated unsanitary kitchen surfaces and equipment from her kitchen,&apos;&apos; the report said. 
 
The origin of this outbreak was quirky, but no less dangerous than other Salmonella outbreaks -- all of which are capable of causing death and long-term health consequences such as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome and other arterial problems.

 FDA Wants Spice Industry to Clean Up 
 Posted on March 14, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Washington Post story on food safety says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants many spice companies to clean up their acts by putting their seasonings through a kill step to rid them of pathogens.

 The story said FDA officials recently met with spice industry officials as part of its re-examination of contamination problems. The review is being prompted by a widespread outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo  strongly associated with black and red pepper -- including the pepper used in more than 1.4 million pounds of recalled Daniele International Inc. salami products. 

Health investigators have confirmed 249 Salmonella infections from the outbreak strain of Salmonella , including more than 60 people hospitalized. National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of the outbreak and is continuing to accept cases. Families in need of a free case consultation can call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our contact form on the side of this Web page.

The Post story said the FDA wants spice handlers to use one of three approved methods to rid spices of bacteria: irradiation, steam heating or fumigation with ethylene oxide, a pesticide. Unless Congress adopts new legislation, the FDA can only suggest the change -- not mandate it.

 
 
 &quot;Consumers often associate salmonella with poultry, meat and other moist foods. But microbiologists say that the bacterium can survive in dried spices for years and that it is tougher to kill in a dry environment. 

 &quot;Also, it takes only a small amount of salmonella in a dry environment to cause human illness, said Linda Harris, a microbiologist at the University of California at Davis,&apos;&apos; the story said. 
 
Cheryl Deem, executive director of the American Spice Trade Association, told the newspaper that contamination of raw ingredients has long been a problem. That because the vast majority of spices are cultivated outside of the U.S., where processing methods often result in contamination, she said.

 Pepper Salami Salmonella Outbreak Update 
 Posted on March 11, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Between January 23 and February 16, Daniele International Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island, recalled a total of 1.4 million pounds of salami products because they were believed to be contaminated with Salmonella Montevideo and/or Salmonella Senftenberg.

The company&apos;s Italian style sausage meat has been strongly associated with an outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo that has sickened at least 249 people in 44 states since last July. Another eight cases of Salmonella Senftenberg have been confirmed by investigators. 

That&apos;s six more illnesses combined than were reported last week and the most recent onset of illness is marked as February 18. Other cases in the process of being confirmed have not yet been added to the overall count.

The Rhode Island Department of Public Health has found the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo in samples of black and red pepper from Daniele&apos;s production plant. Since then, in domino fashion, two of Daniele&apos;s pepper suppliers have announced recalls and a couple of their customers have done the same.

See The Food Safety Lawyer for a comprehensive list of the recalls.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26 percent of outbreak victims have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths.

If you or a loved one is a victim of this outbreak and have seen a physician, you may have legal questions about compensation for medical expenses, lost wages and other costs. For answers and a free case consultation, call national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen . We already represent a number of victims from this outbreak and we are continuing to accept cases at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Salmonella infection can be overcome by healthy adults without treatment, but people should not take this form of food poisoning lightly. In the last national Salmonella outbreak, which was related to contaminated peanuts, nine people died and many more suffered long-term health consequences.

For victims of these preventable outbreaks, one of the long-term risks is a painful condition known as  Reiter&apos;s Syndrome, or reactive arthritis (ReA).   Other possible long-term consequences include infected bone marrow or inflamation of the aorta or the heart muscle.

 Georgia Making Tough Food Safety Law 
 Posted on March 10, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Georgia House has passed a tough food safety law that now goes to the Senate for approval of measures that include criminal sanctions for companies that blatantly disregard human health.

 The legislation stems from the Peanut Corp. of America Salmonella outbreak that killed nine people and injured more than 700 others in late 2008 and early 2009. The company, which quickly went bankrupt after it was linked to the outbreak, operated its main plant in Blakely, Georgia.

According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution , the new bill requires food processing plants to have a written food safety plan, and it subjects those that don’t comply to a $5,000 fine and possible criminal sanctions for subsequent violations.

Other provisions make it a misdemeanor not to report positive test results for problems and a felony to knowingly introduce into a finished food or food ingredients at a plant a tainted substance. Violators could face up to 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine.
 There was some evidence in the peanut outbreak that company officials knowingly shipped nuts that had initially tested positive for Salmonella . Food and Drug Administration inspectors found roaches, roof leaks, rodent infestation and mold while trying to figure out the source of the Salmonella.   National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen represents the families of three women who died in the outbreak and has been supporting efforts on a national scale to pass stronger food safety legislation in Congress.

 Two-Sided FDA Probe of Salami Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on March 6, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Food and Drug Administration is looking closer at the handling of spices from grower to end-user as it also continues to probe a  Salmonella Montevideo outbreak related to red and black pepper in Daniele salami products.

 The salami outbreak has prompted Daniele Salmonella litigation and national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims. The firm is continuing to accept cases from the outbreak and victims can receive a free consultation by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing the information panel on the side of this Web page. 

In its probe of the Daniele salami outbreak, FDA is working with  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  and others to determine the extent to which pepper played a role. The outbreak has sickened more than 245 people in 44 states and has hospitalized more than 60. It started last July.

In the latest FDA report on the salami Salmonella outbreak, the agency said it has collected 153 composite pepper samples at various locations in the supply chain. Samples from four products collected at Daniele International Inc. in Rhode Island tested positive for Salmonella . Samples of crushed red pepper have tested positive for the outbreak strain.

FDA also said it collected samples of pepper from commercial customers (besides Daniele) of Mincing Overseas Spice Company and Wholesome Spice Company. Thus far, two of the samples collected have tested positive for types of Salmonella not associated with the outbreak. The findings prompted Heartland Foods Inc. to recall course ground pepper and Mincing Overseas Spice Company to recall black pepper lot 3309. 

 The overall review of bacterial contamination of spices started last spring and involves developing a spice risk profile. It is designed to help identify what the industry and food safety inspectors can do differently to guard against pathogens.  Some members of the spice industry have already agreed to provide data to FDA for the risk profile, which will help the agency decide how to allocate its prevention resources or possibly make new rules.

 HVP Rolling Recalls Begin as Officials Track Salmonella Tainted Ingredient 
 Posted on March 4, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 A large rolling recall of a variety of food products is likely to occur over the next few weeks once public health officials and manufacturers sort out the widespread use of a flavor enhancer recalled by a Las Vegas company.

The Food and Drug Administration confirmed the presence of Salmonella Tennessee in processing equipment at the company, Basic Food Flavors Inc., after a customer discovered the same type of bacteria in a batch of hydrolyzed vegetable protein, or HVP.

 The sequence led to a recall of HVP by Basic Food Flavors that covers all powder and paste forms of HVP that the company has produced since September 17. The number of food products made with the recalled ingredient is potentially in the thousands.

Already, at least 11 recalls of products containing Basic Food HVP have been recalled and the FDA has established a Salmonella Tennessee recall website for consumers to keep track of which foods are being recalled.

The top official at FDA, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, says the problem was caught before any outbreak of illness. Still, FDA experts advise anyone with symptoms of Salmonella infection to see a doctor and be tested for Salmonellosis.
 
 HVP is not always listed in the ingredient panel of foods, but it is common in small amounts in soups, sauces, chillis, stews, hot dogs, gravies, dips and dressings. Government officials are advising manufacturers on whether recalls of products containing the recalled ingredient are recommended. 
 
Processed foods that go through a&quot;kill step,&apos;&apos; such as high heat, might not have to be recalled.

Dr. Jeff Farrar, associate commissioner for food protection at FDA, told MSNBC that officials don&apos;t know how big the recall will get.&quot;We expect this to get larger over the next several days to several weeks,&apos;&apos; Farrar said.

 Salami Salmonella Litigation Continues as Outbreak Keeps Creeping Along 
 Posted on March 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak keeps creeping along as more and more victims find lawyers to represent them for recoveries.

In the latest update on the 8-month-old outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 245 people have been sickened by the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo in 44 states and Washington, D.C. More than 50 individuals have been hospitalized, but there have been no confirmed Salmonella deaths. 

 Epidemiological studies and DNA fingerprinting of contaminated salami have shown a strong association between the outbreak and black and red pepper used in Daniele salami products.

The CDC said the Food and Drug Administration has collected and is analyzing 153 composite pepper samples, which represent more than 4,000 individual samples of black and red pepper. Samples from two lots of crushed red pepper collected from Rhode Island-based Daniele International Inc. have tested positive for the same strain of Salmonella Montevideo associated with the outbreak. 

 Salmonella infection should not be taken lightly. The bacteria can cause death in young children, older adults and others with weakened immune systems. This pathogen also can cause long-term health consequences such as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome and other forms of arterial infection.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is continuing to accept cases from this Salmonella Montevideo salami outbreak. Our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we currently represent victims from this outbreak.

 Salami Outbreak Leads to Salmonella Pepper Recalls at Other Firms 
 Posted on March 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Just as the Food and Drug Administration foreshadowed, more companies are beginning to recall pepper on the basis of possible Salmonella contamination.

The rolling recall begins with an announcement from Heartland Foods Inc. of Indiana. Heartland is recalling all sizes/containers of COARSE GROUND BLACK PEPPER shipped from its facility in Indianapolis after October 19th, 2009 to February 17th, 2010. The quart, gallon and bucket sized containers bear the Heartland Foods logo.

 The recall is a spinoff of the FDA&apos;s investigation into the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 238 people in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Microbiological testing in that outbreak has found the outbreak strain of Salmonella in black and red pepper, prompting the FDA to investigate the supply chain and other products.

An example of what can result from an ingredient-driven outbreak is the Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) Salmonella outbreak that caused more than 714 illnesses and nine deaths in late 2008 and early 2009. By the time the supply chain was vetted, more than 2,833 peanut-containing products produced by a variety of companies were recalled because they were made with the ingredients recalled by PCA.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of the Daniele salami outbreak and is continuing to accept cases. A free case consultation will be provided by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). You can also contact the firm by completing the information form on the side of this Web page.

Pritzker Olsen also represents a Nevada woman in a pepper Salmonella lawsuit against Union International spice company of California. Contaminated white and black pepper caused the Union International outbreak, which was contained in the West. The woman who is represented by Pritzker Olsen suffered a serious Salmonella infection that kept her hospitalized for many days.

Healthy adults normally overcome Salmonella poisoning without treatment, but infections must not be taken lightly because they are capable of causing long-term damage to your health, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome.

 More Salmonella Recalls Could Stem from Daniele Salami Outbreak Investigation 
 Posted on February 27, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
More food companies may be recalling their products under a continuing investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies into the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak. 

 The FDA has announced in a press release that microbiological testing of ingredients manufactured by a supplier to Daniele has found the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo in crushed red pepper.

The name of the supplier is Wholesome Spice of Brooklyn, New York.
 
 &quot;Wholesome Spice sells spices directly to commercial customers, who may have incorporated them into their own products,&apos;&apos; FDA said in a press release.&quot;FDA is currently working with Wholesome Spice to identify the customers who received the recalled product and determine if further recalls are necessary.&apos;&apos; 
 
The probe stems from an outbreak of Salmonella linked to salami and salame products made by Daniele International Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed at least 238 illnesses in 44 states and the District of Columbia, including more than 60 hospitalizations. The outbreak started last July, but salami wasn&apos;t implicated until January. No one has died.

Red and black pepper are possible root causes of the outbreak, officials have said. 

&quot;The FDA is actively investigating the supply chains of both black and red pepper used in the manufacturing of the recalled meat products. The Agency has collected and is analyzing 153 composite pepper samples, which represent more than 4,000 individual samples.&apos;&apos;

 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of the outbreak and is continuing to accept cases. We are one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness and we have collected tens of millions for victims of food poisoning.

 Supplier to Salami Salmonella Company Recalls Crushed Red Pepper 
 Posted on February 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A Brooklyn, New York, company that sold ingredients to Daniele International Inc. has recalled all of the crushed red pepper that it sold in 25-pound boxes since April 6, 2009.

 The recall by Wholesome Spice was triggered by a finding of Salmonella in the spice by Daniele -- a Rhode Island company whose salami products are associated with a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo. At least 238 people have been sickened and more than 60 hospitalized. No one has died.

The FDA announced today that its own tests and tests by the Rhode Island Department of Health have confirmed the finding. FDA is working with Wholesome Spice to find the source of the contamination.

The Wholesome Spice recall covers 25-pound packages of crushed red pepper sold between 4/6/09 and 1/20/10. The product was sold in the northeastern United States to institutional customers, not retail outlets.

A Food and Drug Administration recall news release said it can&apos;t be determined at this time if the red pepper has made anyone sick, but the company has said it believes red and black pepper is the source of Salmonella contamination in its recalled salami.

 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of this outbreak in Salmonella litigation and is continuing to accept more cases. To contact a Salmonella lawyer at the firm, call 1-888-377-8900 or complete our contact form on the side of this Web page. 

Our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have recovered millions for victims.

 Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. In rare circumstances, Salmonella infection can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

 Daniele Salami Salmonella Outbreak Victims Represented by Pritzker Olsen 
 Posted on February 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to investigate the possibility that pepper in Daniele salami might be responsible for a Salmonella Montevideo outbreak that has sickened 238 individuals in 44 states and the District of Columbia.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen has been retained to represent victims of this salami Salmonella outbreak associated with Daniele International Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island.

The firm represents Salmonella  infection victims throughout the United States, and has recently filed a lawsuit in Nevada (Shirley Shultz v. Union International Food Co., 3:09-cv-00259, United States Court, District of Nevada.) The Nevada lawsuit involves a 2009 outbreak of Salmonella Rissen linked to contaminated pepper produced by California-based Union International Food Company. 

In response to this outbreak, Daniele has recalled more than 1.7 million pounds of salami products starting January 23. The outbreak itself dates to July 2009, hospitalizing an estimated 63 people. Leading states for the outbreak include California (30 cases), New York (18), Washington (17), Illinois (17) Massachusetts (13) and North Carolina (11).
 “Manufacturers are responsible for the safety of their products,”said Fred Pritzker, managing attorney for the firm’s Salmonella cases.“That means recalling adulterated products quickly, clearly and honestly. That does not mean issuing several separate recalls and putting consumers at risk.”    Fred Pritzker is founder and president of Pritzker Olsen, P.A., one of the few law firms in the nation practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. Over the years, the firm has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning. The firm has offices at Plaza VII, 45 7th St. So., Suite 2950, Minneapolis, MN 55402. For more information or to contact Fred, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web Page.   For a complete master list of all the recalled salami products, see The Food Safety Lawyer, Fred&apos;sblog. The products were distributed nationwide, including at several national chains.

 Salmonella Found in Nestle Chocolate Morsels 
 Posted on February 19, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Almost a year after Nestle Toll House cookie dough was linked to a multi-state outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 , the company has found Salmonella contamination in a sample of chocolate morsels made at its plant in Burlington, Wisconsin.

 Nestle spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper that the positive test in chips occurred several weeks ago at the plant. She says there is no recall or Salmonella outbreak associated with the finding, which prompted a cleaning of the plant and many additional tests that produced negative results.

Cyndi Armstrong, public health nurse for the Western Racine County Health Department, said Nestle informed her department of the positive test on Thursday morning.

In 2009, Nestle&apos;s recall of Toll House cookie dough became one of the biggest food safety stories of the year. E. coli O157:H7 -- usually found in raw beef -- had not previously been associated with refrigerated dough.

Nearly 70 people across the country were sickened in the outbreak before it was brought under control. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 25 people were hospitalized and seven developed HUS E coli , or hemolytic uremic syndrome, the leading cause of E. coli deaths.

The E. coli problem in cookie dough reappeared last month at Nestle&apos;s plant in Danville, Virginia, but it was caught before a recall was necessary. At the time, Nestle said it was switching to heat-treated flour in hopes to control the bacteria. National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims from the 2009 outbreak.

 Salami Salmonella Outbreak Cause Remains Uncertain as FDA Looks for Trail 
 Posted on February 18, 2010 by PritzkerLaw The Food and Drug Administration has collected and analyzed nearly 70 domestic and imported black pepper samples in its ongoing investigation of the supply chain of black pepper used by Daniele Inc. in the making of salami. So far, all samples have tested negative for the strain of Salmonella Montevideo causing an outbreak that has sickened at least 230 people in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Daniele&apos;s pepper-coated salami products have been associated with the outbreak in many ways, including the finding of the outbreak strain of Salmonella in an open containers of black pepper at the salami plant. &quot;The FDA is continuing to investigate the possibility that pepper might be responsible for this outbreak and has not yet reached any conclusion,&apos;&apos; the FDA said in a press release. Meanwhile, two suppliers of black pepper to Rhode Island-based Daniele have placed the remaining supply of black pepper in potentially affected lots on hold while the investigation continues. Jeff Farrar, the FDA&apos;s associate commissioner for food protection, told the Washington Post that the agency is now testing pepper samples from other food companies that received pepper from Daniele&apos;s suppliers -- Wholesome Spice Co. of New York and Mincing Overseas Spice Co. of New Jersey. Since January 23, Daniele has recalled more than 1.7 million pounds of salami and other ready-to-eat salami/salame products -- including some made with crushed red pepper instead of black pepper. To see a complete, searchable list of the recalled Daniele Salami products, see The Food Safety Lawyer . National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is preparing a Daniele salami Salmonella lawsuit and is continuing to accept cases from this outbreak.

 Salami Salmonella Recall Expands to Include Products with Red Pepper 
 Posted on February 17, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Initially thought to be caused by contaminated black pepper coatings, the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak now features a recall of company products made with crushed red pepper.

 The USDA announced in a press release today the fourth recall of Daniele salami products since the Salmonella Montevideo outbreak was announced January 23. The latest recall covers 115,000 pounds of salami/salame panino products made with red pepper and also containing mozzarella cheese.

 Consumer Alert : The latest Daniele, Boar&apos;s Head and Dietz&amp;Watson salami products recalled by the company were sold nationwide with use-by dates ranging from February 3, 2010, through May 26, 2010. An unopened sample of these ready-to-eat sausages was found by USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service to contain Salmonella . Lab testing is continuing to see if it matches the outbreak strains of Salmonella Montevideo that have infected 230 people in 44 states and Washington, D.C.

FSIS said Daniele company officials have done preliminary ingredient testing and believe the latest recalled products contain crushed red pepper contaminated with Salmonella. 

The investigation into the outbreak, which started last July, is&quot;ongoing and the root cause has not yet been determined,&apos;&apos; the FSIS said.

Taking the four separate recalls together, more than 2.7 million pounds of Daniele, Boar&apos;s Head and Dietz&amp;Watson salami/salame panino products have been recalled.

 Inspectors Look for Salmonella and Listeria on Deli Meat Slicers 
 Posted on February 12, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Rhode Island Department of Health is leading a national study on whether dirty or badly designed meat slicers in widespread use at delis and markets are making people sick with Salmonella or Listeria poisoning . 

 Providence-based WPRI-TV said the national study was prompted by two Salmonella outbreaks that were traced to poorly designed deli slicers in Washington and Georgia. So far, state health inspectors have swabbed and taken apart slicers in 14 delis and markets in Rhode Island, the station reported.

&quot;The goal is to identify to what extent deli slicers are causing illness,&quot; said Ernie Julian, director of food protection for the state health department.

According to the television report, inspectors have been finding unhealthy conditions where particles of meat get trapped and drip on freshly cut meat -- setting up the possibility of cross-contamination. The debris gets trapped in hard-to-reach areas and not all delis or markets conduct thorough cleaning every four hours, as recommended.

Some of the machines can&apos;t be cleaned effectively because of their design, investigators are finding. Full results of the study are pending while the investigation continues.

 Salami Salmonella Outbreak Still Growing 
 Posted on February 11, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
In the past three weeks of tracking by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of illnesses confirmed in the Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak has grown by 33 cases to the current level of 217 illnesses in 44 states and the District of Columbia.

 The most recent onset of illness confirmed in the investigation came on January 18, but there&apos;s always a couple of weeks of lag time before a person who is sick from the outbreak strain of Salmonella is analyzed and confirmed as a victim.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is accepting cases from this outbreak and has years of experience representing the families of individuals who have become seriously and deathly ill from Salmonella poisoning. We are a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation, recovering tens of millions for victims over the years.

The latest CDC update confirms the hardest hit states as California (30 cases), New York (18), Washington (15), Illinois (14) and Massachusetts (12). More than 50 people have been hospitalized nationwide and no deaths have been reported.

State and federal health investigators have found DNA evidence that pepper salami and hot sopressata calabrese Italian style sausage products made by Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island, caused the outbreak. The company has recalled 1.26 million pounds of product and the CDC is following the pepper trail to see if any other peppered food products are vehicles of the current outbreak.

It has been shown that the two distributors who sold black pepper to Daniele used common overseas sources for the product.

 Salmonella Pepper Supply Chain Probed 
 Posted on February 8, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating the supply chain of black pepper used in the making of 1.6 million pounds of coated salami and other ready-to-eat meats recalled by Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island.

 The recalled salame products have been linked to a 42-state outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo that has sickened at least 213 people and sent an estimated 55 people to the hospital. No deaths have been reported.

A significant amount of people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella didn&apos;t eat salami the week before getting ill, which has given investigators reason to look for other pepper-containing food products as additional sources of the outbreak.

Rhode Island&apos;s own health department confirmed through DNA testing that unopened containers of pepper at Daniele were contaminated with the outbreak strain of Salmonella . The company had suspected it. The pepper was traced to two suppliers who sourced pepper from the same manufacturer.

The first illnesses in this outbreak occurred in early July 2009, but it wasn&apos;t until January that Oregon and Washington health officials locked onto salami as a potential cause. As so often is the case in food poisoning investigations, interviews conducted with ill persons made the difference. Once a correlation was found, DNA fingerprinting confirmed it was correct.

The successful case-control study in this outbreak compared foods eaten by 41 ill and 41 well persons. Preliminary analysis of this study suggested salami as a possible source of illness. Ill persons (58%) were significantly more likely than well persons (16%) to report eating salami. Additionally, 16 ill persons have been identified who purchased the same type of sliced salami variety pack at different grocery store locations before becoming ill.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is monitoring the outbreak investigation and is continuing to accept cases from this outbreak. As a leading practitioner of foodborne illness litigation, we are involved in practically every major outbreak and we have collected tens of millions for victims.

We have experience representing victims made seriously ill by Salmonella , including a woman who spent two weeks in an Arizona hospital last year after consuming contaminated pepper at a Reno resort where a cluster of other people also got sick. 

For a free case consultation call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page. 

Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12–72 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by culture of a stool sample, so it is important to see a doctor. The illness usually lasts from 4 to 7 days.

Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections may occur. Infants, elderly persons, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When severe infection occurs, Salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

 Pepper Salami Salmonella Recall Grows 
 Posted on February 4, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
For the third time since January 23, a Rhode Island salami maker considered to be the cause of a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo has announced a recall of its pepper salame products.

 The two additional Daniele Inc. products weighing a total of 23,754 pounds were recalled after the Rhode Island Department of Health cited pepper salami coatings as the probable cause of the outbreak that has sickened 207 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Inspectors founds the outbreak strain of Salmonella in two unopened containers of pepper at Daniele&apos;s plant. New to the recall:

 3-ounce packages of&quot;DANIELE NATURALE SALAME COATED WITH COARSE BLACK PEPPER.&quot; Approximately 6-pound packages of&quot;DANIELE SALAME GRANDE COATED WITH PORK FAT&amp;PEPPER.&quot; 

Combined, Daniele has recalled 1,263,754 pounds of salami products in three related recalls. Click here to see a complete list of recalled Daniele salame products . 

 Health department spokeswoman Annemarie Beardsworth has been quoted as saying the investigation continues, which FDA has confirmed. That&apos;s because about half the people who have gotten sick in the outbreak didn&apos;t eat any salami.

National food safety law firm Pritzer Olsen continues to monitor the outbreak and accept cases from individuals who have gotten sick.

 Salmonella Outbreak Experts Confirm Pepper as Cause in Salami Outbreak 
 Posted on February 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Black pepper from two different suppliers to Daniele Inc. was contaminated with Salmonella , leading investigators to conclude now that pepper coatings are the probable cause of a nationwide salami Salmonella Montevideo outbreak. 

 The confirmation came from the Rhode Island Health Department. The two pepper suppliers -- Mincing Oversees Spice Company and Wholesome Spices -- imported black pepper from the same source.

“These recent findings show that black pepper used during the manufacturing process at Daniele was the likely source of this outbreak,”said Director of Health David R. Gifford, MD, MPH.“This outbreak only underscores the importance of closely monitoring food that is imported from other countries as they may not have the same food safety standards as we do.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control, a total of 207 individuals infected with a matching strain of Salmonella Montevideo have been reported from 42 states and District of Columbia since July 1, 2009. The number of ill persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK (1), AL (2), AZ (5), CA (30), CO (4), CT (4), DC (1), DE (2), FL (3), GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (11), IN (3), KS (3), LA (1), MA (12), MD (1), ME (1), MI (4), MN (4), MO (1), NC (9), ND (1), NE (1), NH (1), NJ (8), NM (2), NY (16), OH (9), OK (1), OR (9), PA (5), RI (2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (5), TX (7), UT (9), VA (1), WA (15), WV (1), and WY (2). 

Daniele, based in Pascoag, Rhode Island, has recalled 1.24 million pounds of its salami / salame products.

National food safety firm Pritzker Olsen is monitoring the outbreak and accepting cases from individuals who have been sickened. We have been in contact with victims in this outbreak and currently represent a Nevada woman who spent two weeks in the hospital in last year&apos;s pepper Salmonella outbreak linked to pepper grinder and packer Union International Food Co. in Union City, California.

Salmonellosis is a bacterial infection causing extremely painful diarrhea that is often overcome by healthy adults with no treatment. But serious illness and death can result in young children, older adults and those who have weakened immune systems. A small percentage of cases also can result in long-term arterial problems that cause pain and disability.

In this outbreak, 26 percent of victims have been hospitalized.

 2009 Pepper Salmonella Outbreak Sprang From Hot Zone Inside California Plant 
 Posted on February 3, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
A state and federal investigation of the California company linked to 2009&apos;s pepper Salmonella outbreak that sickened 87 people in five states found unacceptably dirty conditions and a veritable hot zone of Salmonella Rissen.

 According to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration report obtained by national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen , Union City-based Union International Food Co. was filthy with bacteria matching the outbreak strain of Salmonella . 

The outbreak started in September 2008 and grew to include 42 illnesses before health investigators associated it with Uncle Chen and Liam How pepper from Union International in late March 2008. The pepper products were recalled from restaurants and retail stores March 28. The five states affected were California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.

A lengthy 2009 inspection performed by 13 investigators found that the company had never tested its products or plant facility for pathogens, had no formal sanitation program and cleaned its primary machinery only when it was too dirty to function.
 
 According to the comprehensive FDA report, the plant&apos;s white pepper grinding room was the epicenter of the outbreak, which sent at least eight people to the hospital. One of those victims is a Nevada woman represented by Pritzker Olsen who spent two weeks at Carson Tahoe Medical Center with acute renal failure. 

 The report said that of 40 swab samples collected from food and non-food contact surfaces in the grinding room at Union International, 34 samples (85%) were positive for Salmonella . DNA fingerprint analysis was conducted for 19 of the 34 swab samples and all 19 matched the outbreak strain of Salmonella Rissen, the report said. 
 
The company had no system to control the spread of dust, which offered no protection against cross-contamination of other operations, the report said. Swabs taken in areas of the plant where a variety of other spices were packed and where Asian style cooking oils and sauces were made, also found Salmonella Rissen.

Union International obtained its whole white peppercorns from Vietnam and the inventory at the plant tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella. Investigators noted in the report that the same strain of Salmonella Rissen had been found in 2006 in an inspection sample of unrelated black pepper imported from Vietnam.

In the midst of last year&apos;s inspection of the company, authorities ensured a shutdown of operations by filing a stipulated preliminary injunction against Union International in Alameda County Superior Court. After many objectionable conditions were documented, the company performed a deep cleaning and overhauled its operations.

After the cleaning and remodeling, all 100 swab samples taken by inspectors came back clean, the report said.

Pritzker Olsen conducted its own investigation of the Union International pepper Salmonella outbreak and continues to accept cases from individuals sickened by it. The firm also is hearing from victims of the current pepper salami Salmonella outbreak involving contaminated salami made by Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island.

 Daniele Salami Salmonella Recall Expanded 
 Posted on February 1, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Illinois Department of Public Health has discovered Salmonella in an unopened salami product made by Daniele Inc. that was not included in the previous recall of 1.24 million pounds of pepper salame products.

 The finding has prompted an additional recall of 17,235 pounds of hot sopressata calabres Italian sausage in 3 to 3.5-pound packages under the Daniele and Boar&apos;s Head brand names. The USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service is peparing a list of retail stores nationwide that purchased the salami products. 

An FSIS press release said the hot sopressata calabres salami was sampled during the course of the ongoing investigation of a 42-state outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo illnesses -- more than 200 cases at last count. The Illinois result marks the first time in the investigation that Salmonella was found in an unopened package of Daniele salami. More tests are being conducted to see if the bacteria matches the outbreak strain.

FSIS said the product tested is similar to previously recalled products bought by customers who later became sick.
 
 Product subject to the expanded recall may have been cross-contaminated with black pepper before it was packed. The company believes that black pepper is a possible source of Salmonella contamination, the FSIS press release said. 
 
Ill persons should immediately see a doctor. In this outbreak alone, more than 38 individuals have been hospitalized. Most healthy adults recover from Salmonella infection without treatement, but it can cause serious illness or death in young children, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems. Up to 2 percent of humans develop reactive arthropathy, or Reiter&apos;s syndrome , after being infected, a condition causing long-term chronic pain and disability.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen has been monitoring this investigation and is accepting cases from individuals sickened in the salami outbreak. To contact a Salmonella lawyer for a free case consultation call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our contact form on the side of this Web page.

 FDA Tracing Supply of Salmonella Pepper 
 Posted on January 30, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Food and Drug Administration is actively investigating the supply chain of the black pepper used in the manufacturing of recalled salami products strongly believed to be the cause of a nationwide Daniele salami Salmonella outbreak. 

 Rhode Island health officials discovered the outbreak strain of Salmonella in an open pepper container at the plant where the salami is made and two other government labs confirmed the outbreak strain of Samonella in products that have been recalled. 

FDA said it has collected and is currently analyzing black pepper samples.&quot;To date, all the samples collected and analyzed by the FDA have tested negative for Salmonella;  however, sample collection and analysis continues,&apos;&apos; the agency said in a press release.

The latest report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says 202 people from 42 states and Washington, D.C., have been sickened by the same strain of Salmonella Montevideo since early July 2009. The most recent, documented onset of illness was January 11.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is monitoring the ongoing investigation, which could possibly lead to additional recalls if contaminated pepper from the same supplier went into other ready-to-eat products. Our firm is accepting salami Salmonella cases from those sickened by the 1.24 million pounds of salami products recalled January 23 by Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island.

If you or a loved one was sickened in this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at our firm for a free case consultation by calling 1-888-377-8900 ( Toll Free) or by completing the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Salami Salmonella Outbreak Strain Found by RI Investigators at Daniele Inc. Plant 
 Posted on January 29, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Rhode Island Department of Health has confirmed that the same strain of Salmonella Montevideo that has infected almost 200 people in 40 states has been found in an open container of pepper at salami maker Daniele Inc.

The Pascoag, Rhode Island, company previously announced a Salmonella finding in its pepper inventory, but didn&apos;t say whether the isolate was a DNA match to the strain making people sick across the country since last July. 

The state didn&apos;t identify the brand of pepper or name the supplier, but did say that this particular brand was only distributed to Daniele Inc. in Rhode Island. The announcement does not ensure that Daniele pepper salami is the only product that caused the outbreak. But so far no products have been added to the Salmonella outbreak recall list .

Because the pepper sample that tested positive by Rhode Island Health came from an open container, it is considered the probable source of the outbreak and more tests are being conducted, the state said.

Previous lab tests by state health officials in Iowa and Washington found the outbreak strain of Samonella in open packs of recalled Daniele sliced variety packs containing pepper salami. 

A key finding in the investigation came from Washingon, where state investigators reviewing shopping receipts verified that 13 cases purchased the same salami variety pack before getting sick. The Iowa salami Salmonella confirmation came from a sample found in salami from a pack that one of the cases had eaten. 
 Washington originally listed 14 cases in the outbreak, but added another this week. Across the country, at least 37 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. To see where the salami was sold, click here.   National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is accepting cases from this outbreak. We are currently representing Salmonella victims nationwide, including some who have suffered long-term consequences, such as arterial infections. Call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page for a free case consultation about your rights to compensation for a Salmonella outbreak that could and should have been prevented.   Salmonellosis is a common foodborne infection that comes from more than 2,000 strains of Salmonella and most people recover from salmonellosis on their own. But it is not to be taken lightly and can be deadly in cases involving young children, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems.

 Daniele Ties Salami Salmonella Outbreak to Contaminated Pepper Spice 
 Posted on January 28, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The Rhode Island company linked to a national salami Salmonella outbreak is reporting that samples of black pepper in its inventory have tested positive for Salmonella .

 The discovery will trigger additional study by state and federal health inspectors to identify the supplier and determine if other peppered products have contributed to the outbreak. More recalls could be announced soon.

Here&apos;s what salami maker Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island, is telling its customers:
 
 Samples of the black pepper used to coat the finished products have tested positive for Salmonella. This indicates that the product was contaminated after processing. We have changed suppliers of our spices, and specifications for spices. We are now using only pasteurized spices. 
 
The outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo has been found in patients and salami. A second strain of Salmonella Seftenberg also has been recovered. As the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy noted, the company doesn&apos;t say which strain was found in its pepper.

 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 189 individuals in 40 states have been infected by the same strain of Salmonella since July 2009. Epidemiological study only recently connected the outbreak to pepper salami made by Daniele. The company has recalled 1.24 million pounds of product and the details of the recall can be seen by clicking here. 

 

Salmonellosis should not be taken lightly. Salmonella is a human pathogen that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. In rare circumstances, it can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis .

 California New York Washington Mass Hardest Hit by Salami Salmonella 
 Posted on January 27, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
In the Daniele pepper salami Salmonella outbreak that has sickened nearly 200 people in 40 states, the largest numbers of cases are found in California, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah and New Jersey.

The number of ill persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo is as follows: AL (2), AZ (5), CA (30), CO (3), CT (4), DE (2), FL (2), GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (11), IN (3), KS (3), LA (1), MA (12), MD (1), ME (1), MI (1), MN (4), MO (1), NC (9), ND (1), NE (1), NH (1), NJ (7), NY (15), OH (9), OK (1), OR (8), PA (3), RI (2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (4), TX (7), UT (7), VA (1), WA (14), WV (1), and WY (2). Because this is a commonly occurring strain, public health investigators may determine that some of the illnesses are not part of this outbreak.

Here is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) map of the outbreak. 

People with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days. Infants, elderly persons and those with weakened immunes systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness.
 
 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is recommending that when a patient seeks medical attention, it is important for physicians to order laboratory tests to detect the pathogens. The test results are important, though not vital, in helping victims collect compensation for their injuries, lost time and medical expenses. 
 
If you have questions regarding your legal rights to compensation related to this nationwide outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen by calling 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or by completing our contact form on the side of this web page.

Our firm is a leader in foodborne illness litigation and our founder and president, Fred Pritzker, has called on Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island, to immediately pay the medical bills and other direct costs of victims of this outbreak, which could have been prevented.

Prevention of food poisoning is an important part of our mission at Pritzker Olsen. We actively support initiatives to strengthen food safety and our clients have given important testimony in Congress to help pass reforms that are long overdue. Fred is a sought-after speaker by food industry executives who work in the area of food safety.

The CDC has said other food products besides pepper salami and salame sold by Daniele could have contributed to this outbreak. We are closely monitoring the investigation and have heard from several individuals around the country who have been affected by this outbreak.

 Pepper Salami Salmonella Outbreak Confirmed in CA WA MA NY IL NC OH OR MN UT NC CT AZ CO GA TX SD TN 
 Posted on January 27, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Two public health labs have confirmed that pepper salami produced by a Rhode Island company, Daniele Inc., is the cause of a national outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo that has sickened at least 189 people in 40 states.

 The confirmations were achieved through DNA fingerprinting by health workers at the Iowa Department of Public Health and the Washington State Department of Public Health.

In Iowa, the molecular subtyping matched the outbreak strain of Salmonella to Salmonella that infected a patient in that state. The sample came from Daniele salami the person had saved in the freezer.

The Iowa sample was from a sliced salami variety pack -- the same as that purchased by at least 13 other ill persons.

The breakthrough was announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which continues to say that it is possible another food item caused illnesses in the outbreak, which started last July and was first detected in Oregon and Washington. 

Daniele has stopped production of its salami and salame products and will now irradiate the pepper it uses on the product to kill germs. Some scientists believe pepper was the vehicle for the Salmonella in this case.

The Pascoag, Rhode Island, company recalled 1.23 million pounds of pepper salami, including variety packs containing pepper salami / salame less than 24 hours after the CDC announced the outbreak late last week. Click here to view a complete list of items  under recall, including products under the Boar&apos;s Head and Dietz&amp;Watson brand.

States hardest hit by the outbreak include California, Washington, New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois and Oregon. But 32 other states have confirmed cases and it is a certainty that some cases have not yet been reported to public health officials. The outbreak was active through the first week of January, at a minimum.

 Probe Widening in Pepper Salami Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on January 25, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
The public health investigation into a 7-month-old Salmonella outbreak is widening and could possibly implicate other contaminated food products in addition to salami.

&quot;It is possible that more than one food product may be causing illnesses,&apos;&apos; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Monday in its latest update on the outbreak. 

The CDC report said preliminary analysis of a recent study of the outbreak has suggested salami as a possible source of illness. Ill persons (51 percent) were significantly more likely than well persons (15 percent) to report eating salami.

Additionally, 11 ill persons purchased the same type of sliced salami variety pack at different grocery store locations before becoming ill. These data suggest this product may be the source of some of these illnesses, the CDC said . This sliced salami variety pack was recently recalled by Daniele Inc. as part of a 1.23 million-pound recall of products containing pepper salami.

The Daniele salami Salmonella recall came less than 24 hours after the CDC announced the outbreak. According to the latest tally, 187 people in 39 states have been infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo . Of 133 victims who provided information, 37 were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.
 
More testing is in the works to look for possible confirmation of the outbreak strain of Salmonella in ingredients at Daniele and in other food products. Private laboratory tests found Salmonella in a retail sample of a Daniele salami product , but the  Salmonella  didn&apos;t match the outbreak strains.

Some scientists believe pepper is the source of the outbreak and there has been a media report saying that Daniele is starting to irradiate the pepper it receives before adding it to meat products. For now, salami product at Daniele of Pascoag, Rhode Island, is on hold.

 Update on Salami Salmonella FAQ Outbreak and Recall 
 Posted on January 24, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
UPDATE March 12, 2010 -- National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen  continues to monitor the state and federal investigation into a S almonella Montevideo outbreak that has sickened 249 people in 44 states and the District of Columbia. The probable cause of the outbreak is peppered salami manufactured by Daniele Inc. of Pascoag, Rhode Island. There is a strong association with black and red pepper used to make the salami.
 
Anyone affected by this outbreak may call Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) for answers to questions about your legal rights to Salmonella compensation. A lawyer will provide a free case consultation and you also can contact the firm by completing the form on the side of the Web page.
 
 Salmonella infection is a serious and sometimes life-threatening matter for young children, older adults and anyone who has a weakened immune system. Salmonellosis is commonly overcome by healthy adults, but should not be taken lightly because it can have long-lasting medical consequences, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome . 

 Extent of outbreak : The number of illnesses currently considered to be part of this outbreak is 249. Of 187 victims who provided information, 49 have been hospitalized (26%). No one has died. It started in early July 2009 and has spread to 44 states and Washington, D.C.. California, New York, Maine, Washington, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Arizona, Texas, Minnesota, Georgia, South Dakota, Utah and North Carolina are leading states.

 Investigating Agencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the outbreak. It is working with USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service , Food and Drug Administration,  and many state health agencies.

 Cause of outbreak : State health laboratories in Iowa and Washington have used DNA fingerprinting to match the outbreak strain of Salmonella to two separate salami samples made by Daniele. In the Iowa case, the patient had kept some salami in the freezer. It came from the same type of Daniele sliced salami variety pack that had been purchased by 12 other ill persons. RI Department of Health has found the outbreak strain of Salmonella  Montevideo in an open container of black pepper at Daniele&apos;s plant. The USDA found Salmonella in a previously unopened sample of salame panino with mozzarella that did not contain black pepper, prompting a recall of these products on February 16. The company believes crushed red pepper is the contaminant in the latest grouping. Testing has confirmed Salmonella in red and black pepper used by the company.

 Salami Recall : Less than 24 hours after CDC announced the outbreak, Daniele Inc. announced the recall of 1.24 million pounds of peppered salami products, including variety packs containing peppered salami or salame. Brands involved in the recall include Daniele, Dietz&amp;Watson, Boar&apos;s Head and Black Bear of the Black Forest. Recall has been expanded three times to include 17,235 pounds of hot sopressata calabres salami, 115,000 pounds of salame panino with mozzarella and more salami for a total of 1.4 million pounds.  Look for USDA Establishment numbers EST 459, EST 54 or EST 9992. See the Food Safety Lawyer for a complete Salmonella salami recall listing .

 Where the Salami was sold : FSIS has published a list of retailers nationwide that have handled salami covered under this Class I High Health Risk recall. The list includes large chains including Costco, Walmart, Fred Meyer, Kroger, Ralph&apos;s and Sam&apos;s Club. Click here (and scroll down) to see the complete, updated store listing . FDA is warning consumers some product still may be on store shelves and in home freezers or refrigerators.

 Salmonella Senftenberg : A different serotype of Salmonella has been found in food samples from retail and a patient household. Eight people have been infected by the same strain of Senftenberg since July 1. Two of the six consumed a recalled salami product a week before falling ill. These are related by not included in the overall outbreak count.

 Advice to Patients : People with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days. Infants, elderly persons and those with weakened immunes systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When a patient seeks medical attention, it is important for physicians to order laboratory tests to detect the pathogens.

 Salami Salmonella Recall Coincides with CDC Report on Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on January 23, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 Salmonella in Salami has prompted a large recall of pepper-coated salami made by a company in Rhode Island and the recall coincides with the announcement of a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella Montevideo. 

 The USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) says in a recall notice today that 1.24 million pounds of salami made by Danielle Inc. is not currently linked directly to the Salmonella outbreak that has sickened 184 people in 38 states, hospitalizing more than 35 of them.

But the FSIS notes specifically that the recalled salami is similar to products bought by customers who later became sick in the Montevideo outbreak. Investigators are still probing and testing.

Meanwhile, a Salmonella expert at the Oregon Public Health Division told the Oregonian newspaper there&apos;s a connection between the salami recall and Salmonella outbreak, which was first noticed on the West Coast last July.

Oregon senior epidemiologist William Keene said a lab near Seattle came up with positive tests for Salmonella in the past few days on salami made by Daniele that was purchased at a Costco in Washington state. Washington has more than a dozen cases in the Salmonella outbreak.

Some scientists suspect that it&apos;s the pepper on the salami. The particular strain of  Salmonella involved in the outbreak is common and that makes it difficult for investigators to pinpoint the culprit food.

“This is a weird outbreak in a lot of ways because it’s been such a long investigation,”Keene told the Oregonian&apos;s Lynne Terry, one of the country&apos;s leading health reporters.&quot;We&apos;ve gone down a lot of dead ends until the puzzle pieces started to fit together.&quot; 
 
 The FSIS has not listed retailers yet who carried the recalled salami, but the Oregonian says vendors include Costco, Walmart, Sam&apos;s Club, Amazon and more. Most products are under the Daniele brand name, but the recall includes several items with the Boar&apos;s Head, Black Bear or Dietz&amp;Watson labels. 
 
All of the recalled products carry a small round USDA mark that says&quot;EST. 54&quot;or&quot;EST. 9992.&quot;Daniele products with other USDA establishment numbers are not being recalled.

 Salmonella Montevideo Outbreak Unknown Source 
 Posted on January 23, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating a nationwide Salmonella outbreak that is due to food poisoning, but efforts so far have failed to identify what food is causing the illnesses.

 As of Friday, investigators had identified 184 individuals in 38 states infected by the same strain of Salmonella Montevideo since July 1, 2009. Onsets of illness are still being reported. The CDC says 28 percent of victims have been hospitalized. The victims range in age from 1 to 88 and the median age is 37.

Working with meat regulators from USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service and with packaged food and produce regulators from Food and Drug Administration -- along with state health officers -- the CDC believes the Salmonella Montevideo illnesses are caused by a&quot;widely distributed contaminated food product.&apos;&apos;

&quot;CDC and its public health partners are vigorously working to identify the specific contaminated product or products that are causing illnesses and will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available,&apos;&apos; the health agency said in a press release.
 
 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is closely monitoring the investigation. Public health officials appear determined to discover the source of the outbreak, which will eventually help to contain the outbreak. Our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have collected tens of millions for victims of food poisoning.

California Salmonella cases top the list at 30. New York Salmonella cases are second with 15 confirmed cases, followed closely by 14 Washington Salmonella cases and 12 Maine Salmonella illnesses and 12 Massachusetts Salmonella cases. There are 11 Illinois Salmonella Montevideo cases in the outbreak.

Here is the complete list of states and numbers of cases considered to be part of the outbreak. Because Salmonella Montevideo is a commonly occurring strain, officials may later determine some cases are not part of the outbreak.

Alabama (2), Arizona (5), California (30), Colorado (2), Connecticut (4), Delaware (2), Florida (2), Georgia (3), Iowa (1), Illinois (11), Indiana (3), Kansas (3), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (12), Maryland (1), Maine (1), Michigan (1), Minnesota (4), North Carolina (9), North Dakota (1), New England (1), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (7), New York (15), Ohio (9), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (8), Pennsylvania (3), Rhode Island (2), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (3), Tennessee(3), Texas (7), Utah (7), Virginia (1).

 Families of Salmonella Outbreak Victims Fight for Food Safety Bill 
 Posted on January 21, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Nellie Napier was the ninth and last person on record to die from Salmonella during the outbreak that sickened more than 700 people in the United States last year. The contamination was traced to Peanut Corp. of America, which recalled its products on Jan. 28, two days after Mrs. Napier died.   With the upcoming one year anniversary of her death weighing heavily on family members, they have joined a group representing 27 people affected by the outbreak by writing a letter to members of the U.S. Senate to pass Senate Bill 510 -- a food safety reform act that should be headed to the Senate floor in the near future.    Also in the victims&apos; group are heirs of Shirley Mae Almer of Perham, Minnesota. It was Shirley&apos;s death in late 2008 that helped public health investigators trace the horrible outbreak to peanut products. Her son, Jeffrey Almer, gave key testimony a year ago in Washington, D.C., before a Congressional panel that has been instrumental in the reform effort.   Nellie Napier, from Ohio, and Shirley Almer were both charismatic, bright lights in their respective families. They are now represented in Salmonella wrongful death litigation by national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen. The leader in foodborne illness litigation also represents the family of Doris Flatgard , another beloved and precious individual who died as the result of contaminated peanuts in the food supply.  The families of the victims have written a letter to members of the Senate to honor their word and quickly pass the food safety bill to prevent future outbreaks. The legislation would be paired with language already adopted in the House. The changes -- designed to make our system more preventative than reactive -- have been pushed by President Obama.   Randy Napier, one of Nellie&apos;s sons, says the victims&apos; group wants the Senate bill passed by Valentine&apos;s Day.   “We’re talking to senators, telling them our story with our mother, and trying to get this food safety bill passed,”Randy Napier told The Gazette, a newspaper from Medina County, Ohio, where the family is from.   Randy, and his brother Jeff, of Rittman, have traveled to Washington, D.C., twice to urge lawmakers to pass reforms that will increase inspections at food-processing plants, improve traceback investigations during outbreaks and give mandatory recall authority to the Food and Drug Administration.

 Iowa Salmonella Outbreak Infects at Least 11 as Investigators Look for Source 
 Posted on January 16, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
Health investigators have confirmed an Iowa Salmonella outbreak, but so far the outbreak has not been traced back to a common source.

 The Iowa Department of Public Health announced the outbreak, saying it has confirmed 11 possible cases of illnesses belonging to the same strain of Salmonella Newport. Of the 11 patients, one person had secondary complications of Reiter&apos;s syndrome , or reactive arthritis.
 
 This syndrome is rare in Salmonellosis but is more common in men, those with HLA-B27 and minorities. What is Reiter&apos;s syndrome? Many clinicians may remember the useful mnemonic&quot;the patient can&apos;t see, can&apos;t pee and can&apos;t climb a tree&quot;describing the symptoms of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and reactive arthritis. This is one more reason to prevent foodborne diseases. 
 National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen actively supports efforts to prevent food poisoning. As a legal representative for victims, the firm has collected millions of dollars for those who have suffered short and long-term consequences of contaminated food. Our firm has experience representing victims of Reiter&apos;s syndrome and Salmonella litigation is not uncommon once health officials trace an outbreak to a source.   To contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen for a free case consultation, call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this Web page.

 Newark Restaurant Salmonella Outbreak Confirmed by Health Department 
 Posted on January 8, 2010 by PritzkerLaw 
 At least 23 people were sickened in late December by contamination at a Newark restaurant in an outbreak of foodborne illness the City of Newark Health Department has confirmed as  Salmonella. 

 The confirmed Iberia Peninsula Salmonella outbreak wasn&apos;t limited to diners who gathered at the restaurant for an office Christmas party, health officials told the Newark Star-Ledger. The investigation is continuing and the restaurant has remained open.

&quot;We have the list of foods served and are in the process of trying to determine the source,&quot;said city spokeswoman Esmeralda Diaz Cameron.

The Star-Ledger reported that health inspectors are re-testing the restaurant&apos;s sauces and will also test Iberia Peninsula restaurant workers for Salmonellosis. 
 
 Most healthy people recover from Salmonella poisoning after extremely painful bouts of diarrhea, but infections should not be taken lightly and anyone with symptoms should immediately see a physician. S almonella illnesses can result in long-term, chronic health conditions and are potentially fatal in young children, the elderly and others who have weakened immune systems. 
 
Restaurants have a legal duty to serve food that is safe to eat. For answers to legal questions about restaurant liability in foodborne illness outbreaks, contact a Salmonella attorney at national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete the contact form on the side of this web page.

 Signs of Newark Restaurant Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on January 2, 2010 by PritzkerLaw Inspectors from the Newark Department of Environmental Health have been monitoring food safety practices at local restaurant Iberia Peninsula for clues to an apparent restaurant  Salmonella outbreak that has affected multiple groups of diners. Peter Dillon, director of inspections at the city&apos;s health department, told New Jersey Real-Time News that inspectors started their work at the restaurant on Tuesday. Real-Time News said various groups of people who ate at the restaurant on three different days around Christmas reported being sickened. One such group -- employees from a local furniture store -- was hit hard. Manuel Guerra, manager of the furniture store, told Real-Time News that two members of the group were hospitalized and at least nine were taking antibiotics for illnesses suffered after a staff holiday outing. Said Guerra: &quot;Never in my life did I think it could be this bad. Right now they’re 99 percent sure it’s Salmonella .&quot; By weekend, there had not been confirmation of a Salmonella outbreak from the health department and the restaurant said it was remaining open and fully compliant with all health regulations. S almonella symptoms include diarrhea, fever, stomach pain and dehydration. Victims of this form of food poisoning should not take infections likely . Salmonellosis is a potentially fatal disease, with long-range consequences beyond extremely painful diarrhea. It is especially dangerous in young children, the elderly and others with weakened immune systems.

 Press Release: 2009 Food Poisoning Recap and Retrospective 
 Posted on December 21, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
MINNEAPOLIS (Business Wire) Dec. 22, 2009 -- Dramatic outbreaks of food poisoning filled the first half of 2009, highlighted by 9 deaths from peanuts contaminated with Salmonella and then by a nationwide outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough.

Less visible but just as menacing throughout the year was the drum beat of human infection caused by E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef. According to a review of federal records by national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys, more than 1 million pounds of ground beef and beef cuts intended for grinding were recalled from market this year by USDA-inspected slaughter plants and processors. The largest of the 15 recalls covered 545,699 pounds of ground beef produced this fall by Fairbank Farms of Ashville, N.Y.

Multi-state E. coli outbreaks associated with these recalls killed at least three people and sickened at least 80, according to the records. The outbreaks resulted in at least 34 hospitalizations and eight confirmed cases of life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) , a disease especially dangerous to children that causes kidney failure and many other serious health conditions.

Since January 2007, the industry has initiated at least 52 recalls of beef tainted with E. coli  O157:H7 compared with 20 in the three previous years, according to the New York Times .

 “This data points to the need for sweeping change in the way food safety is regulated in this country,&apos;&apos; said Fred Pritzker , founder and president of PritzkerOlsen .&quot;While I agree we cannot‘test’our way out of this situation, the current regulatory schemes incentivize producers not to test their product. This is wrong and dangerous and needs to changed.”

The U.S. House in late July approved food safety legislation that would give sweeping new authority to the Food and Drug Administration. If a similar bill is passed by the Senate next year, President Obama would approve the first major changes to food-safety laws in 70 years. Judging from the food poisoning record of 2009, the changes are desperately needed.

The Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak caused by the now-defunct Peanut Corp. of America sprouted in late 2008, but it spilled over into 2009 with a cascading list of product recalls and burgeoning reports of people who had become seriously ill.

On April 29, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued its final report on the outbreak: Nine deaths, 714 confirmed illnesses in 46 states and more than 170 people hospitalized. Because Peanut Corp. was an indirect supplier of peanuts to all different kinds of food makers, the CDC estimated that more than 2,833 peanut-containing products may have been made with the ingredients, prompting a numbing quantity of food recalls that ranged from ice cream to pet food to sandwich crackers.

Pritzker Olsen is representing the families of three people who died in the outbreak and client Jeffrey Almer provided moving testimony on Feb. 11 to members of Congress . Contaminated peanut butter killed his mother, Shirley Mae Almer of Minnesota, after she had twice defeated cancer.

Just as the shock of contaminated peanut butter was wearing off, Americans learned that dangerous microbes were harboring in cookie dough .  E. coli O157:H7 was not previously associated with raw, refrigerated cookie dough. But by mid-summer, 76 people in 31 states were confirmed victims of an E. coli outbreak traced to Nestle Toll House products made in Danville, Virginia. Despite an exhaustive investigation and temporary shutdown of the plant, conclusions could not be made with regard to the root cause of contamination. But, according to the CDC, the outbreak caused 35 hospitalizations and 11 confirmed cases of HUS.

Overlapping the cookie dough outbreak was a more familiar outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 caused by ground beef. At least 24 people from nine states were infected by the same strain of E. coli that Michigan public health investigators found in ground beef produced by JBS Swift Beef Co. There was an initial recall of 41,280 pounds, but it was soon widened to include 380,000 pounds of the product.

A smaller ground beef E. coli outbreak killed a 7-year-old Cleveland girl. Ohio health investigators associated her death with contaminated ground beef from Valley Meats LLC of Coal Valley, Ill., which recalled 95,898 pounds of potentially tainted hamburger meat in May that had been delivered to restaurants.

Two Salmonella outbreaks in 2009 were associated with ground beef produced by Beef Packers Inc., of Fresno, Calif. In August, the plant recalled 400 tons of ground beef , followed in early December by a recall of 22,723 pounds of hamburger products distributed by Safeway food stores in Arizona and Gallup, N.M.

Beyond the raw numbers of recalls and outbreaks, the New York Times showed in a remarkable story published October 3 why eating ground beef is still a gamble. The story, which should win a Pulitzer Prize for reporter Michael Moss, proved that neither the system meant to make the meat safe, nor the meat itself, is what consumers have been led to believe. Moss traced how food giant Cargill used low-grade ingredients and minimal testing protocols to make a hamburger that inadvertently paralyzed a 22-year-old children&apos;s dance instructor. The dancer&apos;s E. coli infection is the kind of nightmare that might wake people up.

 North Dakota Report and Action Pending Against Caterer Tied to Salmonella

In North Dakota, Sheridan County State&apos;s Attorney Walter Lipp is reserving the right to bring misdemeanor charges against a woman from rural Washburn who catered a wedding that made 15 people sick after her catering license was revoked over two previous Salmonella outbreaks.

Altogether, more than 150 people were sickened in Salmonella outbreaks associated with a family reunion and two weddings catered last year by Angie Jennings.

 According to a story by newspaper reporter Brian Gehring of the Bismarck Tribune, the North Dakota State Health Department is nearing completion of a report on the outbreaks. Then, in February, the First District Health Unit in Minot, a division of the state health department, could review the report and take action.

The first two outbreaks were in connection with a wedding in Washburn and a family reunion in Wilton on June 13. State epidemidologist Kirby Kruger told the Tribune that 32 people who attended the wedding met the case definition of Salmonella  poisoning and 13 tested positive for Salmonella M ontevideo, a strain associated with baby chickens.

Kruger said Jennings raised chickens at her rural residence. In 2007, a North Dakota Salmonella outbreak that sickened seven people from different areas in the state was traced to a chicken hatchery in Iowa. He said the DNA pattern in the most recent cases matched the 2007 pattern.

After the reunion, 47 guests met the case definition of Salmonella poisoning with 12 testing positive for the strain. Nine people were hospitalized for treatment in that outbreak, which led to a cease-and-desist order against Jennings.

The following weekend Jennings catered a wedding in McClusky where more than 15 people became ill with Salmonella , according to the Tribune. 

Lisa Clute, executive director for First District Health, said Jennings is currently out of the catering business.

 116 Stores Involved in Safeway Ground Beef Salmonella Recall in Arizona 
 Posted on December 8, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
There are 116 Safeway food stores in Arizona and one additional Safeway in Gallup, New Mexico, involved in the recall of more than 22,000 pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with Salmonella. 

The USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service disclosed the retail list on Monday, reminding consumers again not to eat ground beef produced September 23 by the Fresno, California, plant of Beef Packers Inc., a subsidiary of Cargill. It is the second Beef Packers ground beef recall of 2009 that has been associated with an outbreak of Samonellosis. 

 The first Beef Packers recall and outbreak , announced in early August, sickened 39 people in 11 states and led to the recall of 825,769 pounds of tainted ground beef.

The meat in the latest recall was to be used or frozen by 10/11/09, so authorities believe the danger lies with ground beef that is now in the refrigerators and freezers of Arizona Safeway shoppers. Many of the packages were wrapped on black foam trays and they all are stamped with USDA establishment number 31913 inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The recall includes safeway stores in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Sun City, Sedona, Tucson, Chandler, Glendale and Flagstaff. Click here to see the list in its entirety (scroll down once you see the title page).
 
 State and federal health officials have associated the latest recall with a Salmonella outbreak that has so far infected two people. If you or a loved one has been sickened by ground beef purchased at Safeway in Arizona or Gallup, New Mexico, call a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen Attorneys at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete a contact and information form on the side of this web page.

 Arizona Safeway Stores Recall Ground Beef In Relation to Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on December 5, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Food retailer Safeway is recalling certain ground beef products sold at all of its stores in Arizona and a store in Gallup, New Mexico, because they may be linked to an outbreak of Salmonella. 

The Salmonella ground beef recall is related to fresh hamburger made by Beef Packers Inc. of Fresno, California. More than 22,000 pounds of the meat from Cargill-owned Beef Packers has been associated with a ground beef Salmonella outbreak with two confirmed victims in Arizona. 

 Safeway is recalling ground beef packages from its Arizona stores with sell-by dates of September 28-October 11. Even though all the beef is believed to have been sold by now, the company is urging consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers for the product.

The recall includes fresh ground beef products sold during the dates listed above at the full-service counter in brown butcher paper and at the self-service area wrapped on black Styrofoam trays. These products include fresh ground beef, fresh ground beef patties, fresh meat balls, fresh meat loaf and fresh bell peppers stuffed with beef and pork.
 
 The outbreak strain of Salmonella is from the Salmonella Newport family and is resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals. 
 
Young children, adults over age 60 and people who have weakened immune systems are most vulnerable to Salmonella, which can be life threatening and can also bring on long-term negative health consequences, including Reiter&apos;s Syndrome .

If you or a loved one has been sickened by ground beef sold by Safeway and have been to a doctor, you may have a claim against the retail chain, Beef Packers and Cargill. To protect your legal rights and receive a free case consultation, call a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen Attorneys 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our online contact and information form on the side of this page.

 Beef Packers Salmonella Ground Beef Outbreak in Arizona 
 Posted on December 5, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
State and federal health officials have associated an Arizona ground beef Salmonella outbreak with fresh hamburger produced by Beef Packers Inc. of Fresno, California.

It is the second time this year that Cargill-owned Beef Packers has been tied to a ground beef Salmonella outbreak. The first one, announced in early August, sickened 39 people in 11 states and led to the recall of 825,769 pounds of ground beef. 

The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service  (FSIS) announced late Friday the latest recall of 22,723 pounds of fresh ground beef distributed in Arizona through various retailers. The batch of tainted ground beef was made September 23, 2009, and all retail packages -- regardless of the store -- bear the USDA establishment number of EST 31913 on the USDA mark of inspection. 

Beef Packers sold the meat in 60-pound cases for repacking. The cases were marked&quot;use/freeze by 10/11/09.&apos;&apos;

So far, two cases of Salmonellosis in Arizona have been associated with the ground beef and the investigation is continuing.

The Arizona Department of Health Services notified FSIS of the situation and a joint investigation, including a traceback investigation that determined there is an association between the fresh ground beef products made by Cargill&apos;s Beef Packers plant in Fresno and two (2) illnesses reported in Arizona. The Salmonella Newport strain was isolated both from the patients and from ground beef produced by Est. 31913. They were also linked by their uncommon pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern found in PulseNet, a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

If you or a loved one has become ill after eating ground beef from USDA plant number 31913, see a physician immediately. For answers to legal questions, call a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen Attorneys . We are a national food safety law firm currently representing a victim of the previous Beef Packers ground beef Salmonella outbreak.

 Beef Packers Salmonella Victim Represented by Pritzker Olsen 
 Posted on December 2, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys  is representing an Arizona client who became sick with Salmonella not long after an August 2009 ground beef recall.

The original recall involved 825,769 pounds of ground beef produced by Fresno, California.-based Beef Packers, Inc., which is owned by Cargill Meat Solutions, a subsidiary of Cargill, Inc.
 This is the same contaminated beef recall investigated by reporters at USA Today , who found in a story published this week that the federal government accepted shipments from Beef Packers for the national school lunch program during the same time period that the plant was producing tainted ground beef.   The recalled beef was distributed in Arizona, California, Colorado and Utah. Some of the recalled beef was distributed to and repackaged by Safeway, which recalled the beef from stores in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota and Wyoming.   At the time of the recall, the Colorado Department of Public Health reported at least 15 confirmed cases of  Salmonella associated with Safeway ground beef products.   Anyone sickened in this outbreak may have claims against Safeway, Beef Packers and Cargill.

 Consumer Reports Finds Salmonella, Campylobacter in Most Chickens 
 Posted on November 30, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Consumer Reports magazine has completed its second testing of store-bought raw chicken since 2007, finding only slight improvement in the percentage of fresh whole broilers contaminated with Salmonella and/or Campylobacter. 

These two pathogens are the leading bacterial causes of foodborne illness in the U.S., causing 3.4 million infections, sending 25,500 to the hospital and killing 500 people a year. 

According to the latest chicken test, two-thirds of the birds tested positive for Salmonella and/or Campylobacter . That compares to eight of 10 birds found contaminated in the organization&apos;s 2007 research but is still far too high by any decent food safety measure.

The bacteria commonly grows in the intestines of chickens without harming them. But when droppings from their environments attaches to the exteriors of the animals, it flakes off onto meat during processing.

Here&apos;s a summary of other findings, which Consumer Reports released via press release. Full results can be seen online at the Consumer Reports website : 

 Campylobacter was in 62 percent of the chickens,  Salmonella was in 14 percent, and both bacteria were in 9 percent.  Only 34 percent of the birds were clear of both pathogens. That&apos;s double the percentage of clean birds we found in our 2007 report but far less than the 51 percent in our 2003 report. Among the cleanest overall were air-chilled broilers. About 40 percent harbored one or both pathogens. Eight Bell&amp; Evans organic broilers, which are air chilled, were free of both, but our sample was too small to determine that all Bell&amp;Evans broilers would be. Store-brand organic chickens had no Salmonella at all, showing that it&apos;s possible for chicken to arrive in stores without that bacterium riding along. But as our tests showed, banishing one bug doesn&apos;t mean banishing both: 57 percent of those birds harbored Campylobacter. The cleanest name-brand chickens were Perdue&apos;s: 56 percent were free of both pathogens. This is the first time since we began testing chicken that one major brand has fared significantly better than others across the board. Most contaminated were Tyson and Foster Farms chickens. More than 80 percent tested positive for one or both pathogens. Among all brands and types of broilers tested, 68 percent of the salmonella and 60 percent of the Campylobacte r organisms we analyzed showed resistance to one or more antibiotics.

 Salmonella Cantaloupe Recall by Majesty 
 Posted on November 22, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Lab tests found Salmonella on&quot;Majesty&quot;cantaloupes packed by Five Crowns Marketing of Brawley, California.

In response, Five Crowns has issued a recall published by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall applies to melons shipped earlier this month to Alabama, California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.

No illnesses have been reported and the company believes the melons would have been sold by now. The Majesty cantaloupe recall applies to cartons packed November 4, 6 and 10 with lot numbers 198 2 or 198 3.

 Salmonella  is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Consumers who may have eaten this product and are experiencing the above symptoms should consult their health care provider.

 Church Salmonella Outbreak Victims Urged Not to Take Illnesses Lightly 
 Posted on November 19, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The Cedar Grove Baptist Church Salmonella outbreak in Conway, South Carolina, has sickened at least 125 people, including 11 who have been hospitalized.

State health officials are investigating the cause of this outbreak and families affected by it should not take the illness lightly. See a doctor immediately if you display symptoms of Salmonella and contact a Salmonella attorney to discuss what legal rights you have as a victim of the fundraiser outbreak. To reach national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys , call 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our contact and information form on the side of this web page.
 
 A new study published this week by the Center for Foodborne Illness Prevention&amp;Research delves into the long-range side effects of five human pathogens commonly transmitted from contaminated food. Overall, Salmonella is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, causing 16,000 illnesses a year and more than 550 deaths. 

 The study said an estimated 15 percent of Salmonella victims suffer from symptoms common to Reactive Arthritis (ReA) , also known as Reiter&apos;s Syndrome. This arthritic condition is crippling and can keep some people out of work, giving you additional claims that could be recoverable from the insurance of institutions accountable for the outbreak. The very young, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk. 

 ReA usually resolves itself in two to six months without destroying cartilage, but for a small number of patients it can linger and produce long-term disability. 

 The study on the long-range effects of food poisoning states that more than a third of all reported cases of Salmonellosis occur in children under age 10 and incidence of the disease in children is 10 times higher than in the general population. 
 
Pritzker Olsen is accepting cases from this outbreak and currently represents Salmonella victims. We will provide you with a free case consultation and if we agree to take your case, you owe us nothing until you win.

Our firm is active in efforts to prevent foodborne illness and we have collected millions for those foodpoisoning outbreak victims.

 Company Recalls Michigan Salmonella Sprouts 
 Posted on October 13, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A food company based in Ionia, Michigan, has pulled its sprouts from the market in response to the state&apos;s investigation of a sprouts Salmonella   outbreak that has sickened at least twelve people.

Lansing television station WLNS is reporting that Living Foods Inc. took the action even though lab tests have failed to positively link its sprouts to the outbreak. The sprout outbreak started earlier this month and hit in seven Michigan counties: Bay, Genesee, Kent, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne.
 
The sprouts have sell-by dates of October 22 or earlier. They had been distributed to retail stores and foodservice accounts.If you have health concerns after eating Living Foods sprouts, see a physician immediately. To protect your legal rights, contact a national food safety lawyer at Pritzker Olsen Attorneys , 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). We are currently representing Salmonella victims and our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. To receive a free case consultation online, please complete our contact and information form. 
 
The Michigan outbreak of Salmonella from sprouts prompted the state Department of Community Health to issue a health advisory late last week against consumption of any raw alfalfa sprouts until more could be learned about the source of the outbreak. There was no update of that advisory on Tuesday, nor did state health officials issue any press release about the voluntary recall by Living Foods.

Most healthy adults don&apos;t need medical attention for a Salmonella infection, but the bacteria can cause severe illness and death in young children, older adults, some cancer patients and others whose immune systems are weakened.

 MI Sprouts Salmonella Outbreak Hits in 7 Counties 
 Posted on October 9, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Two Michigan residents have been hospitalized and 10 others sickened in a MI Salmonella Sprouts outbreak that has prompted a public health warning.

State and local health and agriculture officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine the precise source of the sprouts  Salmonellosis outbreak. 

The Michigan Department of Community Health said the illness onset dates have ranged from August 17 to September 18, 2009. The confirmed sprouts Salmonella cases have been spread over seven counties: Bay, Genesee, Kent, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties.

Dr. Gregory Holzman, chief medical executive for the state health department, issued a recommendation that people, especially young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, avoid consumption of raw alfalfa sprouts until more is known about the source.

If you or someone you love has been sickened in this Michigan sprouts outbreak, see a physician immediately. To protect your legal rights, contact national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

Sprouts are always an iffy proposition from a food safety perspective because there are multiple risk factors. If pathogenic bacteria are present in or on the seed when sprouts are planted, the organisms can stick with the plants. In addition, the warm and humid conditions required to grow sprouts are ideal for the rapid growth of the microbes. Thirdly, poor hygiene in production plants can give rise to Salmonella, or E. coli O157:H7 in sprouts.

 $12M Victims Fund Set In Peanut Product Outbreak 
 Posted on October 2, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A $12 million fund to pay victims of the Peanut Corp. of America Salmonella outbreak has been established by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge William E. Anderson.

There are currently 175 claims for illnesses and the fund will be parsed according to the severity of a person&apos;s illness.

 The News and Advance newspaper of Lynchburg, Virginia, the home of PCA, attended the hearing Thursday and said the money will be provided by two Hartford Insurance divisions and the fund will be administered by Roy Creasy, bankruptcy trustee for Western Virginia.

The establishment of the fund is a major step toward settling bankruptcy claims against PCA, which went out of business after  Salmonella   Typhimurium   caused by its Blakely, Georgia, manufacturing plant killed nine people and sickened more than 700 others in 46 states. The outbreak began a year ago, peaked in December and lasted through January.
 
 National food safety law firm Prtizker Olsen Attorneys is representing victims of the outbreak, including the families of three women who died. For more information about filing a claim, contact our office at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete our online information and contact form to receive a free case consultation. 
 
The special victims&apos; fund is off limits to other creditors. Only people who were victims of the outbreak will have access to it and Creasy said the upcoming distribution won&apos;t bar victims from suing re-manufacturers such as King Nut Companies and Kellogg&apos;s -- who used tainted peanuts from PCA to make peanut butter and snack crackers.

All together, nearly 4,000 other food companies who used PCA peanut ingredients to make consumer food products issued recalls after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked the outbreak to PCA&apos;s Georgia plant.

A national announcement of the $12 million PCA victims&apos; fund will be made in a legal notice to be published in USA Today.

 Family Acted Quickly in Memphis BBQ Salmonella 
 Posted on September 26, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 When an outbreak of  Salmonella  hit the Harston Family Reunion this summer in Memphis, Tennessee, organizers Toby and Shandalin Taylor called Fred Pritzker , founder and president of national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen attorneys . 

More than 150 family members from throughout the South and various other parts of the country had attended the three-day reunion, which included a family picnic catered by A&amp;R Bar-B-Q of Hickory Hill Road in Memphis. Within days, Toby and other attendees began exhibiting symptoms of Salmonella poisoning consisting of diarrhea, painful stomach cramps, chills and fever. In some cases, the individuals sought hospital treatment. The picnic menu included pork shoulder, BBQ spaghetti, chicken, coleslaw and bread.

Fred began to investigate and his communication with attendees and the Tennessee Department of Health was followed by a discovery of leftover food from the picnic that tested positive for the outbreak strain of  Salmonella,  a potentially deadly pathogen. The restaurant closed for deep cleaning and its staff received intensive training on how to prevent the spread of foodborne illness.
 
Within just a couple of weeks of being contacted, Fred moved to protect the rights of Toby and Shandalin and their relatives by filing an A&amp;R Bar-B-Q lawsuit in Shelby County Circuit Court in Tennessee. Among other things, the suit alleges a violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Law. Fred chose local Memphis counsel Jason Whitworth to initiate the action. The dramatic events led to intense news coverage by Memphis area television stations and the region&apos;s largest newspaper, the Commercial Appeal.
 
Fred, who has been representing injured people in civil litigation for the past 30 years, was quoted as saying that the food poisoning infections were regrettable for everyone.

&quot;This case points to the tragedy of foodborne illness - a joyful event marred by sickness and a business facing significant loss because of failure to comply with basic sanitation,&apos;&apos; he said.&quot;There are no winners, only losers.&apos;&apos;

 PritzkerOlsen is one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. The firm is a leading national advocate for victims in practically every major outbreak of food poisoning, including the massive peanut butter Salmonella outbreak that killed nine people and sickened more than 700 late last year and early this year. In that outbreak, Fred is representing many individuals, including the families of three women who died from eating contaminated peanut butter. In the national media, Fred is recognized as a leading expert on food poisoning and the firm has gained a reputation as a steadfast voice for improved protection of our nation&apos;s food supply from harmful bacteria that we know can be prevented through safe handling practices, persistent cleanliness of facilities and elementary hygiene.

 Report: School Lunch Food Poison Recalls Ineffective 
 Posted on September 22, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
After 40 years of administering the nation&apos;s school lunch program, you would think the USDA&apos;s Food and Nutrition Service would have a streamlined, fail-proof, highly technological and effective system for recalling potentially contaminated food items it provides for 31 million school children across the country.

Not so.

In fact, the opposite was true in the case of this year&apos;s massive peanut product Salmonella outbreak caused by Peanut Corp. of America. That is apparent from a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) for Congress obtained by USA Today reporters Peter Eisler and Blake Morrison. 

Their important journalistic effort shines new light on a subset of victims in the outbreak and the report itself questions why FNS isn&apos;t wired to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other federal food policing agencies to provide advance warning of the potential for Salmonella , E. coli O157:H7 , Listeria , Campylobacter , or other pathogens in commodities it supplies for school lunch and breakfast.

According to the audit, FNS  lacks systems to ensure it is notified when FDA is investigating a problem. If it knew an investigation was under way, food items in question could at least be shelved until the results are certain.

Instead, from reading the story, here is the sort of thing that takes place:
 
 “Auditors cited the recalls of nearly 4,000 products containing peanuts from Peanut Corp. of America. After Salmonella was traced to the company’s Georgia plant, the FDA announced a limited recall of products made during a specific period. But the Food and Nutrition Service determined that its purchases from the plant were not made during that time and said on its website that schools weren’t affected. Not until six days later—after the recall was expanded to cover products made on other dates—did the service tell schools to pull all the plant’s products&quot; 
 
Even when recalls are instituted by FNS -- which also is in charge of supplying nutrition to children in daycare settings -- it can take more than a week for recall information to reach schools, according to the audit.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys has filed a Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit against Peanut Corp. of America i n connection with the outbreak. The firm -- one of the nation&apos;s best known and highly regarded practitioners in the area of foodborne illness litigation -- represents the families of three women who tragically died in the outbreak. 
 
 The GAO report sheds new light on our nation&apos;s handling of the outbreak. the GAO believes that 226 students who got diarrhea, stomach pain and other Salmonella symptoms —including 46 who were hospitalized—may have consumed tainted products in school. 
 
 Overall, more than half of the approximately 700 confirmed victims of the outbreak were under the age of 18. Statistics show that 21 percent were under age 5 and 33 percent were age 5 to 17. If you are a parent or guardian to one of the children sickened in this outbreak, contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen. An attorney can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free).

 Shredded Lettuce Salmonella Outbreak Suspected 
 Posted on September 14, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Salmonella outbreak that may have been caused by shredded lettuce sickened at least 124 people nationwide, but the outbreak has subsided and investigators may never pinpoint the cause.

That is the report out of Oregon today in a story produced by reporter Lynne Terry of The Oregonian. 

There was a clustering of these  Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses in the West, including two people who were hospitalized in Oregon, one with severe damage. William Keene is senior epidemiologist at Public Health Division in Oregon. He told the newspaper that shredded lettuce is a leading suspect and many of the victims who were interviewed had eaten at fast food restaurants.

But Keene said the outbreak is not tied with any recall and authorities are not warning people away from lettuce or fast food restaurants. If lettuce was the culprit, it&apos;s all eaten by now, the story said.

According to The Oregonian, the first cases began to appear in mid-July. By the end of August the outbreak had reached its peak and tapered off.
 
 In recent times, major outbreaks of Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 have been tied to leafy green vegetables such as lettuce or spinach almost every year. In the past, investigators have linked outbreaks to specific producers. Dole, for instance, caused a bagged lettuce E. coli outbreak in 2005 and a baby spinach E. coli outbreak in 2006. 
 
National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys is currently representing Salmonella Typhimurium victims, including the families of three women who died of the disease late last year and early this year after eating contaminated peanut butter.

Our law firm has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning and is dedicated to preventing foodborne illness. Between Salmonella and E. coli, more than 100,000 people a year become infected in the United States, thousands of whom are hospitalized.

If you or a loved one was diagnosed with the outbreak strain of Salmonella in this latest outbreak, contact a Salmonella attorney at Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). To receive a free case consultation online, go to our contact form and submit your information via the Internet.

 Alas, Another Peanut Product Salmonella Recall 
 Posted on September 12, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Just when you thought the world was safe from contaminated peanuts, a Michigan candy maker has thrown another log on the peanut product Salmonella recall and outbreak fire that started almost one year ago with the first traces of matching illnesses later linked to Peanut Corporation of America. 

Kilwin&apos;s Quality Confections Inc. of Petoskey, Michigan, late this week recalled all of its seven-ounce packages of chocolate-covered peanuts and bulk chocolate-covered peanuts sold at Kilwin&apos;s retail stores in Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Colorado, Rhode Island, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. No illnesses have been reported.

Kilwin&apos;s said the recall applies to chocolate-covered peanuts sold before April 1, 2009, because they were made with nuts sourced from the Texas plant of Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) before the company went bankrupt and the plant was shut down early this year. The product comes in a gold foiled plastic package with a clear center section and is labeled&quot;Milk Chocolate Peanuts,&apos;&apos; and&quot;Fresh dry roasted peanuts covered in creamy milk chocolate,&apos;&apos; Kilwin&apos;s Quality Confections, Petoskey, MI 49770. The barcode on the package is 001615.

In January and February, when information about the outbreak and recall was at its peak, hundreds of recalls a week were announced by companies that sourced peanuts from PCA. By mid-June, there had been 3,916 such recalls, but the announcements had slowed to nary a trickle by the end of summer.
 
 The Kilwin&apos;s recall is a reminder that Salmonella in food ingredients has the potential to put all of America at risk for food poisoning. According to a wrap-up report issued months ago by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 714 people in 46 states had confirmed cases of Salmonellosis linked to contaminated PCA peanuts. Nine individuals lost their lives in the outbreak, including three whose family members are represented in lawsuits against PCA by national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys. 
 
Our law firm was proud to see client Jeffrey Almer testify before Congress this year at a crucial hearing that eventually led to passage in the House of a food safety reform act backed by the Obama administration. If the Senate passes similar legislation later this year, the tragic death of Jeff&apos;s mother, Shirley Mae Almer of north-central Minnesota, from contaminated peanut butter, will have contributed to meaningful change.

 Salmonella Cantaloupe Recall by Melon Acres 
 Posted on August 30, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 An Indiana melon grower has recalled 27 bins of cantaloupe after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found Salmonella in a sample batch.

The melons were shipped through Farm-Wey Produce of Lakeland, Florida, to Aldi&apos;s in Greenwood, Indiana; and Meijer stores in Lansing, Michigan; Newport, Michigan and Tipp City, Ohio. The recalled cantaloupes were identified as 41MG10, Bins 4753-4980. 

Melon Acres said in a press release that it has shut down the field where the melons were picked and is working with the FDA to determine the source of contamination. The positive sample finding was reported August 21, 14 days after a third party food safety auditing firm gave the farm good and excellent marks for food safety.

The FDA said no illnesses have yet been reported in connection with the Salmonella recall cantaloupe.

Most cases of Salmonella poisoning don&apos;t require medical treatment, but infections can cause serious illness that lead to hospitalization, even death. National food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker has produced a Salmonella video outlining steps that Salmonella victims should take to protect their legal rights if they are sickened in an outbreak of the disease.

His firm, Pritzker Olsen attorneys , is one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and Mr. Pritzker is a frequently quoted in national newspapers and on television as an expert on the topic.

 Food Poisoning Victims Face Long-Term Health Risk 
 Posted on August 15, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Getting poisoned by Salmonella or C ampylobacter is not just a short-term health concern.

That&apos;s what a medical team in Denmark has concluded in a study that found these pathogens to increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn&apos;s disease, for 15 years or more after a person suffers from an initial infection of either diarrheal illness.

The risk is particularly high for patients who are hospitalized for treatment of Salmonella or Campylobacter , according to Dr. Henrik Nielsen from Aarhaus University Hospital in Aalborg, Denmark, and his colleagues. Their findings are published this month in the journal Gastroenterology. 

The Danish medical team compared the risks of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) between 13,148 patients with documented gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella or Campylobacter and 26,216 uninfected, healthy controls.

Over the course of seven and a half years, IBD was diagnosed in far more gastroenteritis patients (107 or 1.2 percent) than healthy control subjects (73, or .5 percent). The increased risk persisted throughout the 15-year observation period.

Reuters Health summarized a key finding:&quot;After accounting for a variety of factors that might influence the risk, stomach bug patients had nearly a threefold increased risk of developing IBD over the entire study period, and nearly a two fold increased risk in the first year after infection.&apos;&apos;
 
 The study underlines what food poisoning experts at Pritzker Olsen attorneys have known for a long time: Diarrheal illnesses that people contract through no fault of their own from food contaminated with harmful bacteria is nothing to be taken lightly. Our lawyers continually see how people suffer long-term health consequences from E. coli O157:H7 , Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria and other adulterants in food, not to mention Hepatitis A -- which is typically spread by unsanitary practices of an infected person handling food in a restaurant. 
 
If you or someone you know has suffered food poisoning at the hands of a meat producer, (including the Cargill E. coli outbreak ), food retailer, restaurant or caterer, protect your rights and call a food poisoning attorney. Pritzker Olsen lawyers can be contacted at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Or, to receive a free case consultation via the Internet, submit your information online.

 Inspectors Saw Cattle Being Pulled into Cargill Plant 
 Posted on August 11, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 The Cargill-owned beef processor in California that recently recalled 826,000 pounds of ground beef products out of concern it might be tied to a ground beef  Salmonella outbreak was caught last year stunning cattle and dragging them into the plant unconscious.

Lester Friedlander, a former USDA veterinary inspector, told The Associated Press that such a practice could increase the risk for E. coli and Salmonella contamination. That&apos;s because cow hides can pick up the bacteria from feces that sometimes collect around the plant entry chutes, Friedlander said.

The AP story by reporter Garance Burke in Fresno said the dragging of knocked-out animals was witnessed by U.S. Department of Agriculture auditors who inspected Fresno-based Beef Packers Inc. in March 2008. Their report said workers were using electric prods to herd cattle into the slaughterhouse.

 When three cows refused to budge, they were rendered unconscious&quot;so that they could be pulled through the restrainer to be shackled, hung and bled,&apos;&apos; the inspection report said.

According to the AP, Cargill Meat Solutions appealed the alleged violations and the USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service  later rescinded the violations and sent Beef Packers a letter of concern.

Dan Thompson, a professor with Kansas State University&apos;s Beef Cattle Institute, said problems with animal handling do not necessarily lead to meat contamination.
 
 Neither Cargill nor the USDA has provided details about what prompted last week&apos;s major recall, which was followed by a Safeway ground beef recall and Von&apos;s recall . Health officials in Colorado, California and Wyoming have said a total of 28 illnesses have been associated with the recalled beef. Twenty one of the illnesses were reported in Colorado, where the meat was sold at Sam&apos;s Club and Safeway stores. 
 
If you or someone you love was sickened in the Cargill Salmonella outbreak, contact a Salmonella attorney at Pritzker Olsen attorneys . As one of the country&apos;s leading food safety law firms, our firm has collected tens of millions of dollars for victims of food poisoning.

 Safeway Was Big Distributor of Recalled Cargill Beef 
 Posted on August 7, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Safeway, Von&apos;s and Sam&apos;s Club are among retailers in nine states warning consumers that ground beef involved in a massive Cargill beef recall could be contaminated with a drug-resistant strain of Salmonella Newport . 

Colorado has been hardest hit by the outbreak. The Colorado Department of Health and Environment has recorded about half of the 40 confirmed illnesses in the outbreak. Four people in Colorado were hospitalized but are recovering, state health officials say. Colorado Salmonella investigators found a high correlation between people sickened with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Newport and their consumption of ground beef purchased at Safeway stores.

In California, where Safeway is based, news reports say five confirmed illnesses have been found in Orange and Tulare counties. Safeway owns Von&apos;s, which has many stores in Southern California. The San Francisco Chronicle said Sam&apos;s Club also made an announcement about the recalled beef, which is probably in people&apos;s freezers by now if it hasn&apos;t already been eaten.

The Cargill ground beef recall encompanses nearly 43 tons of ground beef produced June 5-23 at the Fresno, California, plant that Cargill operates as Beef Packers Inc. An official notice from the USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service said it may be linked to an outbreak of Salmonellosis.

The meat was distributed by Safeway in Colorado, California, Arizona, Hawaii, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota and Wyoming. If the product was purchased from a retailer owned by Safeway, look for use-by dates between June 6 - July 14. Packages also should be stamped with the USDA establishment number EST. 31913.

If you or someone you love has been sickened as part of this outbreak, contact a Salmonella attorney at the Pritzker Olsen law firm . Our firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation and we have filed Salmonella lawsuits for victims around the U.S. As one of the nation&apos;s leading food poisoning law firms, we have collected tens of millions of dollars for victims and we are involved in practically every major outbreak of foodborne illness.

 New outbreak highlights overuse of antibiotics and underuse of traceback and notification systems 
 Posted on August 6, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
By FOOD SAFETY ATTORNEY FRED PRITZKER 

A new Salmonella outbreak was announced today: over 825,000 pounds of ground beef products processed by Fresno, CA-based Beef Packer, Inc. and distributed to retail distribution centers in Arizona, California, Colorado and Utah.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), the“particular strain of Salmonella Newport is resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.”In other words, this already“bad bug”is potentially much more dangerous than the“garden variety”of Salmonella (which by itself is particularly dangerous to the elderly, young children and people who are immune-compromised).

This latest Salmonella outbreak highlights a number of long-standing food safety issues.

The first is widespread and dangerous overuse of antibiotics in animal production. As many studies have shown, the prophylactic administration of massive amounts of antibiotics to livestock results in drug-resistant superbugs that are much harder to control and cause much greater harm to people sickened in foodborne illness outbreaks. I can think of no greater heartbreak than watching a loved one get progressively more ill from a foodborne illness and know that doctors are powerless to treat it.

Another issue raised by this Salmonella Newport outbreak is referenced in the following excerpt from the USDA-FSIS recall notice:

 The ground beef products were produced on various dates ranging from June 5, 2009 through June 23, 2009 and bear the establishment number&quot;EST. 31913&quot;printed on the case code labels. The ground beef products were distributed to retail distribution centers in Arizona, California, Colorado and Utah. Because these products were repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names, consumers should check with their local retailer to determine whether they may have purchased any of the products subject to recall. 

In effect, our government is telling us that it’s up to individual consumers to track down whether the hamburger they consumed is laced with feces-laden poison. Could this approach be any more ass-backwards?

 Colo. Soopers Salmonella Beef Warning Repeated 
 Posted on August 1, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Colorado health officials are worried that ground beef contaminated with Salmonella is still contributing to an outbreak associated with King Soopers Inc.

The Denver-based King Soopers recalled nearly half a million pounds of ground beef on July 23 after evidence showed contamination with Salmonella typhimurium DT104 -- a microorganism that is resistant to many antibiotics prescribed for treatment of Salmonella infection. 

According to the Denver Post, the Colorado Department of Health and Environment repeated a warning Friday for Coloradans to avoid eating ground beef or thoroughly cook it to guard against the outbreak strain of Salmonella. So far, there are 21 confirmed cases, including four who were hospitalized but now are recovering.

If you or someone you know was sickened with Salmonella after eating ground beef purchased in Colorado, contact Pritzker Olsen attorneys at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free) or complete one of our online consultation forms.  Pritzker Olsen is representing Salmonella victims around the country, including the families of three women who died in the peanut butter Salmonella outbreak late last year and early this year. Our lawyers are among the few in the country who practice extensively in the area of foodborne illness and we have collected tens of millions for victims of food poisoning.

The original Colorado ground beef recall notice said the contaminated meat was sold between May 23 and July 23 at King Soopers and City Market retail grocery stores in Colorado. Friday&apos;s story in th ePost said it is possible that the contaminated meat is still on sale and there is concern that meat purchased last month is still in consumers&apos; freezers.

 Pritzker Files Suit in Memphis Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on August 1, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Pritzker Olsen attorneys, one of the nation&apos;s leading food safety law firms, has filed a Memphis Salmonella lawsuit in Shelby County Circuit Court in Tennessee on behalf of a husband and wife who ate food catered from A&amp;R Bar-B-Q restaurant of Hickory Hill Road.

Toby and Shandalin Taylor of Memphis were organizers and attendees of the 2009 Harston Family Reunion, which featured a picnic for more than 150 extended family members at Shelby Farms Park on July 10. A&amp;R catered the event with pork shoulder, BBQ spaghetti, chicken, coleslaw and bread.

 The lawsuit alleges Toby Taylor contracted Salmonella from one of the offerings -- an alleged case of negligence, recklessness and a violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Law. He was one of more than two dozen people whom health officials say contracted the disease after eating A&amp;R food around July 10 and 11.

The suit was filed Friday by local Memphis counsel Jason Whitworth. Pritzker Olsen is accepting additional cases from others sickened in the outbreak. Contact the lawyer who is currently working on our Memphis Salmonella BBQ lawsuit at  1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free), email Fred Pritzker at fhp@pritzkerlaw.com or complete our online case consultation form. 

&quot;This case points to the tragedy of foodborne illness - a joyful event marred by sickness and a business facing significant loss because of failure to comply with basic sanitation,&apos;&apos; said Fred Pritzker, founder and president of Pritzker Olsen.&quot;There are no winners, only losers.&apos;&apos;

Pritzker Olsen is one of the few law firms in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. The firm is involved as an advocate for victims in practically every major outbreak of food poisoning, including the peanut product   Salmonella   Typhimurium outbreak  that killed nine people and sickened more than 700. That outbreak prompted passage this week in the U.S. House of Representatives of sweeping food safety reform. In the peanut product outbreak, Pritzker is representing the families of three women who died from the outbreak strain of   Salmonella.

 More Than 24 Victims in Memphis Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 30, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Public health officials in Memphis say that preliminary tests show that more than two dozen people were infected with Salmonella after eating food served by a local barbecue restaurant.

The Memphis Salmonella outbreak spiked when more than 150 people from throughout the region and different parts of the country gathered for a picnic July 10 at Shelby Farms as part of the three day 2009 Harston Family Reunion. The picnic was catered by A&amp;R Bar-B-Q, 3721 Hickory Hill Road in Memphis. That restaurant has been closed since Saturday for retraining of its employees, a health department review and a self-examination.
 
National food safety lawyer Fred Pritzker , who is representing family members sickened in the outbreak, told Memphis Commercial Appeal reporter Ryan Poe that multiple individuals were hospitalized for treatment. Pritzker, founder of the Pritzker Olsen law firm, has been telling newspaper and television reporters in the region that he will follow the health department&apos;s investigation and weigh legal options for the victims.
 
The outbreak is not necessarily limited to attendees of the Harston Family Reunion. Anyone sickened in the outbreak can contact Pritzker at 1-888-377-8900 ( Toll Free), or by email at fhp@pritzkerlaw.com  or via online consultation form .

Nicole Lacey-Hall, a spokeswoman for the  Memphis and Shelby County Health Department , told the Commercial Appeal that food samples from A&amp;R on Hickory Hill have been sent in for laboratory testing in an attempt to pinpoint the source of the Salmonella outbreak. The samples included spaghetti, pork, chicken and cole slaw.

Pritzker&apos;s law firm is one of the few in the country practicing extensively in the area of foodborne illness litigation. The firm is involved in practically every major outbreak of food poisoning and has collected millions on behalf of victims.

Pritzker Olsen currently represents the families of three women who died late last year and early this year in the peanut product Salmonella outbreak caused by a Georgia peanut plant owned by Peanut Corp. of America . Some healthy adults can withstand Salmonella without medical treatment, but the disease can be a serious health threat to young children, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems.

 Officials Investigate Memphis Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 29, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The Memphis and Shelby County Health Department is conducting an active investigation into the Hickory Hill location of A&amp;R Bar-B-Q restaurant in Memphis.

The announcement was made in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Health shortly after national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen issued a press release about a Memphis Salmonella outbreak  . Some victims of the outbreak were attending the three-day Harston Family Reunion in Memphis and Pritzker Olsen has been retained to represent them. 

More than 150 family members were in town from throughout the region and different parts of the country for the reunion. The gathering featured a picnic July 10 at Shelby Farms Park which was catered by A&amp;R Bar-B-Q, 3721 Hickory Hill Road.

The Memphis and Shelby County Health Department said it will hold a news briefing Thursday to discuss the case. The investigation is epidemiological and environmental in nature and&quot;is in response to receiving some complaints alleging foodborne illnesses stemming from food consumption on July 10 and 11.&apos;&apos; The probe was launched July 14 to determine the source of the problem, but no conclusions had been drawn as of Wednesday, public health officials said.

The health department said the restaurant closed voluntarily on Tuesday and remained closed Wednesday as the owners cooperated with authorities. Fred Pritzker, founder and president of Pritzker Olsen, said a number of victims provided stool samples that have tested positive for Salmonella.

 Salmonella Outbreak Tied to Colorado Beef 
 Posted on July 22, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
A Colorado company is recalling 466,236 pounds of ground beef products that may be linked to a Colorado Salmonella outbreak of at least 14 matching Salmonella illnesses reported in the state. 

The firm is called King Soopers Inc. of Denver. The Salmonella type -- as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment -- is Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. The information was released late Wednesday by the USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the agency in charge of keeping our meat supply safe.

&quot;FSIS has no reason to believe that these products are still available for sale in commerce,&apos;&apos; the press release said. However, consumers that may have purchased these fresh ground beef products between May 23 and June 23, 2009, could have stored them in their freezers.

The ground beef products bearing the USDA establishment mark&quot;EST. 6250&quot;were distributed to retail establishments in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. 

If you or a loved one has been sickened by ground beef products in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico or Wyoming, call national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen Attorneys .

 Anaheim Peppers Recalled by Georgia Company 
 Posted on July 12, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
A Georgia company has recalled a lot of its Anaheim peppers after the New York State Department of Agriculture found Salmonella in a sample. 

Anaheim peppers are a very mild chile, six to 10 inches long, that are normally used in cooking. The recalled peppers were shipped in mid June to retailers in New York, Massachusetts and Ohio by Herring Produce of Lake Park, Georgia.

The company said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recall. The peppers under recall were shipped in half-bushel boxes with production lot number 0801206 located on a red sticker on the box.

 The most common source of Salmonella food poisoning is the feces of animals or infected persons. Most cases of Salmonella in healthy adults do not require medical treatment, but young children and the elderly can suffer serious illness from infection, even death.

 Symptoms of Salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach pain. If you or someone you love has become seriously ill from Salmonella, contact Pritzker Olsen Attorneys at 1-888-377-8900 (Toll Free). Our law firm is one of the most experienced food poisoning firms in the country.

 FDA Acts to Curb Salmonella in Chicken Eggs 
 Posted on July 7, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Vice President Joe Biden today announced findings of the President&apos;s Food Safety Working Group, and one of the first real concrete changes of the initiative occurred simultaneously when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a new preventative rule to curb Salmonella in eggs. 

 The reform is expected to prevent 79,000 Salmonella illnesses and 30 Salmonella deaths a year. It would reduce the number of infections from Salmonella Enteritidis (the most common type found in chicken eggs) by 60 percent. 

 The rule requires the following preventative measures by all egg producers with more than 3,000 laying hens. Producers with more than 50,000 laying hens must comply within one year of the rule&apos;s entry in the Federal Register. The others have three years to comply.  

 1 . Buy chicks and young hens only from suppliers who monitor for Salmonella bacteria. 2. Establish rodent, pest control and biosecurity measures to prevent spread of bacteria throughout the farm by people and equipment. 3. Conduct testing in the poultry house for Salmonella Enteritidis. If the tests find the bacterium, a representative sample of the eggs must be tested over an eight week time period (4 tests at two week intervals); if any of the four egg tests is positive, the producer must further process the eggs to destroy the bacteria, or divert the eggs to a non-food use. 4. Clean and disenfect poultry houses that have tested positive for  Salmonella Enteritidis. 5. Refrigerate eggs at 45 degrees Fahrenheit during storage and transportation no later than 36 hours after the eggs are laid.

 Pasta Shop Suspected in Local Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on July 7, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A pasta shop in Central Virginia is being investigated as the possible source of a Salmonella outbreak among six dinner guests who ate lasagna purchased from the shop&apos;s frozen foods inventory.

WVIR-TV quoted the shop owner as saying the establishment is not to blame and that the lasagna was sold with instructions for safe cooking.&quot;We&apos;ve had no trouble whatsoever with our food in the past and I hope this is not a problem with our food,&apos;&apos; Chef Jim Winecoff of Mona Lisa Pasta Shop said.

Dr. Lilian Peake of Thomas Jefferson Health District says her team of investigators has not pinpointed the lasagna as the cause and will look at multiple factors. Meanwhile, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs is reportedly assessing conditions at the shop while the health department continues to interview dinner guests. WVIR-TV said a report is forthcoming within a week.

 Salmonella food poisoning is usually overcome by healthy adults without medical treatment, but it can lead to hospitalization and even death -- especially among young children, the elderly and others with compromised immune systems. Symptoms of Salmonella usually start to occur six to 72 hours after the bacteria is swallowed. Symptoms may include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain and dehydration.

 Cause of Texas Salmonella Outbreak Unsolved 
 Posted on July 4, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Health investigators in Texas are examining a cluster of 25 Salmonella illnesses in and around Lockhart, Texas, but they have not yet found a cause.

Doug McBride, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper that a few of those infected with Salmonellosis have been hospitalized. In Caldwell County, where the outbreak has occurred, there is usually only seven to nine cases of Salmonella reported in a year. 

 Symptoms of Salmonella include diarrhea, headache, stomach cramps, nausea and sometimes vomiting. The symptoms go away after several days, but an infected person may be able to pass the disease to another person for up to two months.

The bacteria is spread by eating contaminated food, drinking contaminated water, or having hand-to-mouth contact with the feces of an infected person or animal.

If you or someone you know has possibly been infected with Salmonella bacteria, see a physician immediately. Most healthy adults can withstand the disease without treatment, but it can be fatal to young children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.

 Judge Delays Filing Deadline for PCA Salmonella 
 Posted on June 13, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A judge in Virginia has extended the deadline for Salmonella    victims of  Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) to file claims against the company in bankruptcy court.

The deadline had been set for Monday, June 15. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William E. Anderson on Friday granted a motion by the trustee in the case, Roy Creasy, to postpone it until October 31 so that everyone has time to be heard.

Associated Press newswoman Sue Lindsey reported that as of Friday, 252 damage claims totaling $207 million had been filed in the case from Salmonella illnesses traced to peanut products made by PCA. More than 700 Americans across the country were sickened by peanut butter, peanut butter snack crackers and other peanut products containing adulterated ingredients produced by PCA.
 
Nine consumers died in the outbreak and the families of three of those victims are represented by Pritzker Olsen Attorneys , a national food safety law firm that has collected tens of millions for victims of food poisoning. We are currently accepting more PCA peanut butter Salmonella cases.

 Salmonella Hits School Children in Missouri 
 Posted on June 4, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
An elementary school in Lee&apos;s Summit, Missouri, is working with health department officials there to determine what caused a  Salmonella outbreak at the very end of the school year. 

Mary Naudet, principal of Richardson Elementary School, told the Lee&apos;s Summit Journal newspaper that at least two students in the Kids&apos; Country program became ill from the outbreak strain of Salmonella. She said additional students at Kid&apos;s Country also were ill during the past two weeks of school, including one who was hospitalized. But those illnesses occurred before anyone suspected a Salmonella outbreak..

This week, the school sent notices to parents informing them of the outbreak and encouraging them to contact the school if any children were sick during the last few weeks of the school year.

  Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning , especially diarrhea, usually occur six to 72 hours after initial exposure to the bacteria. Healthy adults rarely require medical treatment during a spell with Salmonella . But the pathogen can be deadly for young children, the elderly and others with weakened immune systems.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys is currently representing Salmonella  victims from outbreaks in different parts of the country. For instance,  Salmonella lawyers at the firm are representing the families of three women whose deaths late last year were linked to the  Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak that was caused by Peanut Corp. of America.

With years of experience in foodborne illness litigation, the firm has collected tens of millions of dollars for its clients. Pritzker Olsen also has been visible in the national fight for stronger and more effective food safety laws, rules and inspections.

 PEPPER SALMONELLA OUTBREAK TIME LINE 

March 28 -- California Department of Public Health announces that consumers should avoid eating spices manufactured by Union International of Union City, California. By then, white and black pepper from the firm had been associated with 42 Salmonella Rissen illnesses in four states. A high proportion of victims had eaten at Asian restaurants where the company&apos;s pepper was served.

March 30 -- Family-owned Union International issues original recall of white pepper, black pepper and a few other dry spices, including paprika and curry powder. Salmonella matching the outbreak strain had been found in an open container of white pepper at a restaurant where more than one victim had eaten.

April 2 -- Food and Drug Administration  alerts public to Uncle Chen and Lian How brand pepper and dry spice recall. The FDA said the products were sold mostly to ethnic restaurants, wholesalers and grocery retailers in the western region.

April 3 -- Union International expanded its recall to include additional dry spices, including nutmeg, cumin powder and crushed chili powder.

April 4 -- EDS Wrap and Roll Foods of Hayward, California, announces a recall of six tons of frozen chicken egg rolls because they contained black pepper spice from Union International that may be contaminated with Salmonella . The recall notice is published simultaneously by the USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service.

April 9 -- Shirley Schultz diagnosed with an infection of Salmonella Rissen in Nevada.

April 15 -- California Department of Public Health warns consumers to avoid sauces and oils made by Union International. By now, 57 people in four states have been diagnosed with the outbreak strain of Salmonella , including 42 in California.

 CDC Still Telling Consumers Not to Eat Sprouts 
 Posted on May 7, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Officials investigating a widely dispersed outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul first focused on a single grower of alfalfa sprouts in Nebraska before fanning out and finding matching Salmonella contamination at sprout growers in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In the end, federal authorities determined that all the growers received contaminated seeds that traced back to a single seed grower in Italy. Preliminary details of the investigation were released this week in a news release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC, along with the Food and Drug Administration , continue to warn Americans not to eat raw alfalfa sprouts.

Since the outbreak began in early February, the outbreak had sickened 228 people in 13 states. About 4 percent of victims have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported, the press release said.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen represents victims in this outbreak and is currently accepting additional cases from every state involved. The firm has considerable experience and a reputation for success in representing survivors of foodborne illness. Fred Pritzker and members of his firm are frequent guests and commentators about food safety issues and have been interviewed by and profiled in a number of media sources including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal , The Associated Press and CNN. 

To contact a Salmonella lawyer at Pritzker Olsen, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or write to us online for a free case consultation. 

 State by State 

Overall, the numbers of confirmed cases by state look like this: Nebraska (110 cases), Iowa (35), South Dakota (35), Michigan (18), Kansas (8), Pennsylvania (7), Minnesota (5), Ohio (3), Illinois (2), West Virginia (2), Florida (1), North Carolina (1) and Utah (1) .

The CDC report said regulators are still checking the degree to which the various sprout growers appropriately and consistently implemented FDA recommendations to protect against pathogens in sprouts. The guidelines, issued in 1995, include seed disinfection and tests of water used to grow sprouts. 

The report said alfalfa seeds could become contaminated in several ways, although the exact method is unknown. Possible methods include pre-harvest contamination from use of contaminated water, the use of improperly composted manure as fertilizer, fecal contamination from domestic or wild animals and runoff from animal production facilities.

&quot;Alfalfa seeds are produced for agricultural use, and might not be processed, handled, and stored under conditions appropriate for human food,&apos;&apos; the report said. Preventing seed contamination is vital because the conditions suitable for growing sprouts are also ideal for increasing counts of bacteria that might be present on seeds, the report said.

 New Hampshire Camp Reopens After Salmonella 
 Posted on May 2, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
An environmental camp for school children operated in Madison, New Hampshire, has reopened after a Salmonella outbreak sickened dozens of middle school classmates. 

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen is representing victims of the outbreak, which the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services has traced to a kitchen mixer. According to media reports, the mixer was used to make both pudding and scrambled eggs. Investigators concluded that contaminated pudding was served by Purity Spring Resort, the camp&apos;s food provider.

Pritzker Olsen, a highly regarded specialist in foodborne illness litigation, has recovered millions over the years for victims and survivors of food poisoning. Currently, the firm is representing clients around the country in a variety of different outbreaks, including the families of three women who died in the ongoing peanut butter Salmonella outbreak caused by Peanut Corp. of America .

To contact the firm, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete our online form for a free case consultation. 

In the New Hampshire case, dozens of middle schoolers attending Stone Environmental School became ill and at least 15 of the illnesses were later confirmed as the same type of Salmonella. While state health officials investigated, the school voluntarily shut down.

David Freese, camp director, told The Union Leader newspaper of Concord, New Hampshire, that a new style of kitchen mixer will be used for food preparation.

 Recall of Alfalfa Seeds Associated with Salmonella Saintpaul 
 Posted on May 2, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Alfalfa seeds from Italy have been associate with a multistate Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak . After preliminary epidemiology regarding the ongoing outbreak of illness from Salmonella Saintpaul in people who had eaten alfalfa sprouts was shared with the supplier of the seeds, the supplier made the decision to voluntarily withdraw certain alfalfa seeds from the market. According to an FDA alert, the recalled alfalfa seeds include the following: 
 
 [Seeds] in 50-pound white bags that are either paper or woven from a synthetic material, and the lot numbers in question begin with“032,”followed by a hyphen and three more digits. The bags carry a computer-generated white or yellow label, on which is printed“Distributed by Caudill Seed Company., 1402 W. Main St., Louisville KY 40203”and the lot number.
 
 
 CDC Alfalfa Sprouts Salmonella Outbreak Information 

CDC is providing updated information on the alfalfa sprouts Salmonella outbreak. Here is the most recent information from the CDC (last modified April 27):
 
Since mid-March, 35 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Saintpaul have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Michigan (17), Minnesota (4), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (6), South Dakota (2), Utah (1), and West Virginia (2). Cases are still being reported, and possible cases are in various stages of laboratory testing, so illnesses may be reported from other states. No deaths have been reported.
 
 FDA Recommendations for Growers and Retailers 

The FDA alert to growers, retailers and other businesses regarding the alfalfa seed recall provides recommendations for businesses:
 
 Retailers, restaurateurs, and personnel at other food-service facilities should ask their suppliers to verify that the alfalfa sprouts or seeds being provided do not come from an affected lot before buying or serving them. Suppliers who can verify that their products were not sourced from the affected lots may wish to notify their customers; likewise, retailers, restaurateurs, and food-service facilities who have verified the sources of their alfalfa products may wish to notify their customers.
Seeds from the affected lots, lot numbers beginning with 032, and sprouts grown from them, should be safely discarded, as should other products that contain the sprouts, such as sprout blends. 

 Growers who have used seeds from the potentially contaminated lots should clean all equipment and other surfaces that came into contact with them. They should also safely discard any water that came into contact with the sprouts, and disinfect receptacles or equipment that came into contact with the water.
 

FDA has long-standing guidance for the sprout industry and continues to urge growers to follow this guidance, which can reduce the risk of contamination with Salmonella and other bacteria (available on the FDA web site at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprougd1.html). FDA also urges retailers to use sprouts obtained from growers who follow the FDA guidance.
 
FDA Warning to Consumers Not to Eat Raw Alfalfa Sprouts

Although the FDA, CDC and state and local health officials have found at least one source of the sprouts Salmonella , FDA has not revised its warning to consumers not to eat raw alfalfa sprouts :
 
The US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that consumers not eat raw alfalfa sprouts, including sprout blends containing alfalfa sprouts, until further notice because of a risk of Salmonella serotype Saintpaul contamination. As soon as the source of the contamination is identified, FDA will work with the alfalfa sprout industry to help identify which alfalfa sprouts are not connected with this contamination. Other types of sprouts have not been implicated at this time.

 Peanut Butter Crackers Still Causing Salmonella 
 Posted on April 30, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Peanut butter crackers containing Salmonella are still making people sick and the outbreak caused by Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) is expected to continue for the next several months.

That&apos;s what the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is saying this week in its latest written update on the  Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak that has sickened 714 people in 46 states. The CDC also said once again that nine deaths are believed to have been caused by contaminanted peanut products made with nuts supplied by PCA, which is now being liquidated in Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen represents the families of three of those who died and firm founder and president Fred Pritzker last week toured PCA&apos;s dumpy processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, as part of a wrongful death lawsuit  he has filed against the company.

&quot;The numbers of new cases have declined substantially since the peak in December, but illnesses are still being reported among people who ate the recalled brands of peanut butter crackers after the recall,&apos;&apos; The CDC said&quot;The outbreak is expected to continue at a low level for the next several months since consumers unaware that they have recalled products in their home continue to consume these products. Many of the products have a long shelf-life.&apos;&apos;

PCA&apos;s Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak was ingredient driven -- meaning PCA was a supplier of peanuts to many different food plants around the country. The CDC says at least 2,833 different products have been made with potentially contaminated PCA peanuts.The FDA keeps an online index of the product recalls.

Kellogg Co. was among the very first companies to issue a recall, saying its Keebler and Austin brand peanut butter crackers were made from nuts processed by PCA.

 FDA Seizes Salmonella Peanuts From Westco 
 Posted on April 30, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
U.S. Marshals have seized $34,500 worth of Peanut Corp. of America (PCA ) peanuts and products containing the peanuts from Westco Fruit and Nut Co. Inc., a private firm that refused to voluntarily recall food suspected of containing a strain of  Salmonella blamed for nine deaths . 

The Food and Drug Administration said the raid occurred this week at Westco&apos;s headquarters in Irvington, N.J.

 The situation at Westco has highlighted a legal weakness at FDA when it comes to policing food safety. Even though PCA&apos;s Salmonella -laced peanuts were known to have caused more than 700 illnesses in 46 states and nine deaths, the agency didn&apos;t have legal authority to demand a recall of products known to contain the deadly pathogens.

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen and its clients have been demanding changes to food safety laws for years. The firm represents the families of three women who died from peanut product Salmonella infections since last December. A Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit has been filed against PCA in connection with the deaths. In addition, Jeffrey Almer, the son of one of the victims, provided star testimony before a congressional panel earlier this year investigating the deadly outbreak.

According to the FDA, here&apos;s an update on what has taken place at Westco. The firm has yet to issue a voluntary recall of products it sold to market containing PCA peanuts:

On March 23, 2009, the FDA asked to voluntarily recall all of its products containing peanuts from PCA because of the contamination threat. Westco refused. The owner said it would be economic suicide for his business. On April 8, 2009, the FDA served Westco with an inspection warrant in an attempt to gain access to the company’s distribution records.

More than a month after the initial request, on April 27, the FDA asked the Marshals to go in and take undistributed product. They did.

If you have been injured by a serious case of food poisoning, call Pritzker Olsen at 1-888-377-8900 (toll free). To receive a free case consultation online, write to us. 

  Fred Pritzker , the president and founder of the firm, is a frequent guest and commentator about food safety issues and has been interviewed by and profiled in a number of media sources including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and The Associated Press.

 Salmonella at Camp May Have Come From Mixer 
 Posted on April 29, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
An electric mixer used to make scrambled eggs and chocolate pudding may have caused a Salmonella  outbreak at a student camp in New Hampshire earlier this month.

 WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, has reported that the state Department of Health and Human Services determined that pudding at Stone Environmental Camp  was contaminated with Salmonella.  The investigation was conducted after more than 50 students from a middle school in Salem, New Hampshire, came down with gastrointestinal problems after an overnight stay at the camp. 

Officials confirmed that at least 15 of the students suffered from Salmonella poisoning, a potentially fatal infection for young children, the elderly and others with weakened immune systems. National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen represents Salmonella clients around the country, including the families of three women who died in the peanut product Salmonella outbreak that swept the country starting last September.

The television report on the New Hampshire outbreak said the bacteria could have come from the mixer because it also was used to make scrambled eggs, which can contain Salmonella. The mixer was sanitized after every use, the television station reported, but a design defect may have allowed bacteria to get to an area where it couldn&apos;t be cleaned out.

Pritzker Olsen founder and president Fred Pritzker  is involved in practically all major outbreaks of foodborne illness and has recovered large sums on behalf of people injured or killed by adulterated food. His firm is devoted to educating the public about food safety issues and advocating for badly needed food safety legislation and increased funding for the federal, state and local agencies charged with protecting our food and enforcing food safety laws.

 FDA and CDC Confirm Salmonella in Sprouts 
 Posted on April 27, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
An outbreak of 31 cases of Salmonella Saintpaul has prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a general advisory for consumers not to eat alfalfa sprouts. 

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen  represents victims of the outbreak and is accepting additional cases from all affected states To reach a Salmonella lawyer at the firm, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free), or complete a free case consultation form. 

The FDA and CDC said in a press release that all 31 cases with matching genetic fingerprints have been confirmed in six states. The number of actual cases may be higher and is likely to grow, the agencies said. The illnesses started in mid-March and the outbreak appears to be an extension of a Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak that began in February in Nebraska, where grower CW Sprouts Inc., issued a recall.

 Pritzker Olsen is involved in practically all major outbreaks of foodborne illness and the firm&apos;s food poisoning attorneys have recovered millions of dollars in damages for victims. Currently, we are representing the families of three women who died with Salmonella infections they suffered after eating peanut butter and other products made by Peanut Corp. of America. 

In the current Salmonella outbreak linked to sprouts, the FDA and CDC said initial results in the investigation trace back to multiple growers in multiple states. The six states currently listed as venues for the outbreak are Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia. 

The outbreak may be linked to contaminated seeds and the bad seeds may account for a large proportion of seeds now in use, according to the press release. In 1999, FDA issued guidance for sprout growers on how to avoid  Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7   from harboring in their plants.

Now the agency is working with the industry to return to stricter adherence to those guidelines, which include instructions on how to disinfect seeds with chemical spray. The full FDA and CDC press release can be found here .

 Alfalfa Sprouts Linked to Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on April 27, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Pritzker Olsen law firm is representing people sickened in a mutistate Salmonella outbreak linked to raw alfalfa sprouts.

 This outbreak continues to widen, and the FDA and CDC are recommending that consumers not eat raw alfalfa sprouts, including sprout blends containing alfalfa sprouts, which have been linked to widespread Salmonella serotype Saintpaul contamination. Other types of sprouts have not been implicated at this time.

According to an FDA announcement:
 
The investigation indicates that the problem may be linked to contamination of seeds for alfalfa sprouts. Because suspect lots of seeds may be sold around the country and may account for a large proportion of the alfalfa seeds currently being used by sprout growers, and cases of illness are spread across multiple states, FDA and CDC are issuing this general advisory.

FDA will work with the alfalfa sprout industry to help identify which seeds and alfalfa sprouts are not connected with this contamination, so that this advisory can be changed as quickly as possible.

CDC, FDA and state and local authorities in six states have associated this outbreak with eating raw alfalfa sprouts. Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia have reported 31 cases of illness with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Saintpaul to CDC. Most of those who became ill reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts. Some reported eating raw sprouts at restaurants; others reported purchasing the raw sprouts at the retail level.

The illnesses began in mid-March. Cases are still being reported, and possible cases are in various stages of laboratory testing, so illnesses may appear in other states. No deaths have been reported. The number of infected people may be higher than currently reported because some illnesses have not yet been confirmed with laboratory testing.

The CDC and FDA recommend at all times that persons at high risk for complications, such as the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems, not eat raw sprouts because of the risk of contamination with Salmonella or other bacteria. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses, such as meningitis and bone infections.

Initial investigation results trace the contaminated raw alfalfa sprouts to multiple sprout growers in multiple states. This suggests a potential problem with the seeds used, as well as the possible failure of the sprout growers involved to appropriately and consistently follow the FDA Sprout Guidance issued in 1999 http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprougd1.html. The guidance recommends an effective seed disinfection treatment immediately before the start of sprouting (such as treating seed in 20,000 parts per million Calcium hypochlorite solution with agitation for 15 minutes) and regularly testing the water used for every batch of sprouts for Salmonella and E coli O157:H7 contamination.

This outbreak appears to be an extension of an earlier outbreak in 2009. In February and March, an outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul infections occurred in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and Minnesota . This outbreak was linked to raw alfalfa sprouts, and the outbreak strain was indistinguishable from that of these recently reported cases. A separate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections was also linked to sprouts in 2009. In the 1990s, a number of outbreaks related to sprouts led FDA to issue its guidance. Experience over the past decade has shown that the likelihood of Salmonella in sprouts can be minimized when recommendations from FDA’s Sprout Guidance are followed.

Preventive controls are very important in the growing of alfalfa sprouts. FDA reminds sprout growers to be vigilant in their food safety practices and strongly encourages sprout growers to follow the Agency’s Sprout Guidance. Additionally, the United Fresh Produce Association has advised all of its members to follow FDA’s guidance on sprouts. FDA appreciates that the produce industry has reinforced this message and reminds retailers that it is prudent to sell sprouts from growers who follow FDA&apos;s recommendations.
 
There are a number of parties that may be liable for illnesses related to this Salmonella outbreak:

 The grower of the alfalfa sprouts The processor The distributor A restaurant, deli, cafeteria or other eating establishment 

Many of the victims of this outbreak consumed the Salmonella -contaminated sprouts at restaurants. Generally, restaurants are liable for any illnesses associated with their food, even if the the food was contaminated with Salmonella before it got to the restaurant.

Compensation for victims of Salmonella outbreaks may include the following:

 Medical Expenses (past and future) Lost income (past and future) Pain and suffering (past and future), including physical pain, suffering, emotional distress and disability

 Alfalfa Sprouts Cause Salmonella Outbreak Again 
 Posted on April 26, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to announce soon a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella associated with alfalfa sprouts and the announcement may be coupled with an advisory for consumers to avoid eating sprouts.

 

National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys already represents victims in this outbreak and is accepting additional cases from all the states involved. Salmomella attorneys at the firm can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 or you can readily receive a free online case consultation . 

According to pubished reports, there are currently 31 confirmed Salmonella Saintpaul cases in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia. The Michigan Department of Community Health already is telling consumers in that state to avoid alfalfa sprouts after at least two victims of the outbreak were hospitalized.

The cases reportedly have a rare fingerprint and the pattern matches a recent outbreak that started in Nebraska and included a sprouts recall by Nebraska-based CW Sprouts, aka SunSprout Enterprises Inc . Pritzker Olsen is representing victims in that outbreak.

The latest outbreak reportedly involves more than one grower of sprouts and a trade association for the fresh produce industry already is warning growers to fall back in line with specific growing guidelines created more than five years ago by the FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the  California Department of Health Services .

Since 1995, alfalfa sprouts emerged as a recognized source of foodborne illness, including Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 . This year, there have already been at least three Salmonella outbreaks linked to sprouts.

In the Midwest (Nebraska and Iowa especially), there was the outbreak associated with CW Sprouts; in the northeast there is a current outbreak started in early April associated with a recall of sprouts distributed by Amalgamated Produce Inc. and on April 23 another Salmonella-related recall was announced by Calco Inc. of Arcadia, California.

 Pritzker Olsen is involved in virtually all major outbreaks of food poisoning and the firm is one of the few firms in the country that are intensely focused on foodborne illness litigation. The firm has collected millions of dollars on behalf of victims of food poisoning.

Currently, clients of the firm include the families of three women who died in the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak caused by peanut butter and other products made from peanuts processed by Peanut Corp. of America of West Virginia.

 CJ United Spices, Onions Tied to Salmonella Outbreak 
 Posted on April 24, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
National food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys is representing one of the victims of a western states Salmonella outbreak caused by contaminated spices.

In total, at least 60 people have been sickened in four states, including 45 people in California, where the adulterated spices were produced. 

In a press release this week, California Department of Public Health Director Mark Horton said the illnesses in his state have occurred in 18 counties in Central and Northern California. He said the latest onset of illness had been April 2.

The outbreak has been associated with peppers, curries and other spices made by Union International Food Company of Union City, California. The firm has recalled all of its products produced in Union City because of the potential they carry Salmonella. 

Horton announced this week that CJ United Corporation of Oakland also is recalling products. CJ United said it had purchased white pepper, black pepper, curry powder and other spices from Union International.

CJ United&apos;s recall initially covered five-gallon plastic jugs of white pepper (powder), black pepper (powder), curry powder, paprika, cayenne and meat tenderizer. Then on Friday, the company also recalled five-pound plastic containers of its chopped onions, which had been delivered to restaurants.

The jugs of spices and onions all have the words&quot;Natural&amp;Delicious&apos;&apos; along with the CJ United Corporation logo.

 Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, the elderly or others with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.

Pritzker Olsen represents Salmonella  victims around the country, including the families of three women who died separately late last year and early this year with infections linked to peanut products made by West Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America .

The firm is involved in virtually every large outbreak of foodborne illness and has collected millions of dollars on behalf of victims of food poisoning. To contact a Salmonella attorney at Pritzker Olsen, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete a free case consultation form online.

 Sprouts in Southeast Michigan Causing Salmonella 
 Posted on April 23, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
Michigan health officials are seeing a growing number of Salmonella cases that investigators believe are associated with contaminated alfalfa sprouts used in sandwiches.

According to multiple media reports, the Michigan Department of Community Health is still looking for the origin of the sprouts. In the meantime, they are recommending that residents of the state avoid eating sprouts until more is known about where they are coming from. 

Officials have said at least 16 cases have been confirmed in southeastern Michigan, with most illnesses occurring between March 23 and April 6. At least two of the 16 received hospital care.

Already this year, alfalfa sprouts have spawned more than one outbreak of Salmonella . For years the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cautioned young children, senior citizens and people with weakened immune systems not to eat alfalfa sprouts for fear of contracting food poisoning.

Healthy adults don&apos;t usually require medical treatment during a Salmonella illness, but those in risk groups can potentially come down with serious illness and die from infections. For instance, national food safety law firm Pritzker Olsen attorneys currently represent the families of three women who died in the nationwide peanut butter Salmonella outbreak that started last September and has sickened more than 700 people.

Previous outbreaks have been linked to manure in fields and poor hygiene in producing the food, which starts as a seed or bean. Infection with Salmonella typically causes diarrhea, fever and cramps, lasting from four to seven days.

 Salmonella Hits Students at Overnight Camp 
 Posted on April 22, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 Nearly 70 middle school students in the Salem, New Hampshire, public school district called in sick this week as part of the fallout from a Salmonella outbreak.

The outbreak occurred at an overnight camp late last week near North Conway, New Hampshire. The Eagle-Tribune newspaper quoted State Director of Public Health Dr. Jose Montero as saying that at least one student was hospitalized.

Students who attended the Stone Environmental School&apos;s overnight camp had symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea and high fever. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services determined the children were infected with Salmonella after analyzing stool samples.

A team of investigators was sent to the overnight camp to inspect the facilities, interview staff and interview students. But Montero told the Eagle-Tribune that the exact cause of the outbreak may never be discovered.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., currently represents Salmonella victims and survivors around the country, including the families of three women who died with Salmonella  infections in the massive outbreak caused by Peanut Corp. of America.

The firm has considerable experience and a reputation for success in representing survivors of foodborne illness. The firm is involved in virtually every major outbreak of food poisoning and has collected large sums on behalf of people injured or killed by adulterated food.

 Pistachio Salmonella Investigation Trudges On 
 Posted on April 19, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to investigate what links there are between  Salmonella found in contaminated pistachios and the same strain of Salmonella found in ill people whose cases are part of the CDC&apos;s collective food poisoning database known as PulseNet. 

Recalls of pistachio foods that may be contaminated with the pathogen  Salmonella Montevideo are continuing and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is still making daily updates to its  searchable database of affected products.  

The CDC , FDA and California Department of Public Health have spent months investigating Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc., Terra Bella, California. A large customer of the company first alerted the government to positive Salmonella tests taken from batches of Setton pistachios. When health officials inspected Setton&apos;s facilities, they found Salmonella in critical areas of the facility and the potential for cross-contamination between roasted product and raw product.

No outbreak of illness related to the contamination has been confirmed, but the latest FDA report on the investigation shows some areas of interest. Quoting directly from the report:

Some of the DNA fingerprints of the Salmonella strains from the pistachio products match the DNA fingerprints of Salmonella strains from recently ill persons already in the PulseNet database. This particular strain of Salmonella also has been isolated from a stool sample in a child who developed gastroenteritis and who is reported to have consumed pistachios that were sourced from Setton Pistachio. In addition, this specific Salmonella fingerprint matches a number of other clinical isolates in the PulseNet data base. However, it is important to recognize that when a patient’s isolate has a relatively common DNA fingerprint pattern (such as this one) that matches that of a food isolate, it does not necessarily follow that the patient’s illness was related to that food. CDC is investigating whether the other cases infected with this strain of Salmonella have had exposure to pistachios from Setton Pistachio.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is involved in virtually all major outbreaks of foodborne illness. The firm currently is representing Salmonella victims around the country, including the families of three women who died with Salmonella infections after consuming contaminated peanut products.

If you or someone you know has become seriously ill from food poisoning, please call the law firm at 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or get a free case consultation.

 Salmonella Spice Outbreak -- Recall Expanded 
 Posted on April 16, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The California food wholesaler whose spices have been linked to a multi-state Salmonella outbreak in the West has expanded its consumer product recall to include all Uncle Chen and Lian How sauces, oils and oil blends. 

Union International Food Co. of Union City also said its recall now covers all types of dry spice products in 15-pound and smaller containers and 30-pound boxes and smaller packages of crushed chili.

All the products may be contaminated with Salmonella, the company said.

The recalls started in March, when the company&apos;s Uncle Chen and Lian How brand pepper was suspected of causing the outbreak, which initially was described as sickening more than 20 people in California, Nevada and Oregon.

Officials are still investigating the multi-state Salmonella outbreak. Salmonella was ultimately isolated from an open container of Lian How White Pepper, which was found at a restaurant where some outbreak victims ate. Union International said the chili sauce, sesame oil and chili oil products have not been linked to the outbreak but the company said it was&quot;acting with an abundance of caution.&apos;&apos;

The list of oils and sauces in the latest recall include 100 Percent Pure Sesame Oil, Chinese Sesame Oil, Chinese Style Sesame, Jaisun Sesame Oil, Jaisun Blended Soybean and Sesame Oil, 100 Percent Black Sesame Oil, Chili Oil, Chili Sauce, Hot Bean Sauce, Hunan Red Chili Sauce, Sweet Flour Sauce, Fresh Ground Chili Paste, Garlic Chili Extra Hot Sauce and Superior Red Chili Oil.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A.,  currently is representing Salmonella victims, including the families of three women who died from Salmonella infections in the national outbreak caused by Peanut Corp. of America. The infectious bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, the elderly and other people who have weakened immune systems.

 Salmonella Victims Have Cruise Ship in Common 
 Posted on April 15, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 We are not handling these cases. Thank you.
 

 The Minnesota Department of Health , one of the best health departments in the United States, reported this outbreak in its online publication, Bug Bytes, on March 23, 2009. Here&apos;s the state report:

 Anchors Aweigh 

Last week we noticed two Minnesota Salmonella Oranienburg cases that matched by PFGE. As usual, we immediately contacted and interviewed both cases, one being still hospitalized. Both cases had a history of recent travel on the same cruise ship that left a Florida port on February 15 to the Caribbean.

One of the cases is an adult female from the Twin Cities who flew to Florida and boarded the cruise the same day. Her onset of illness began the second day of the cruise. She had called the cruise line to report her illness and she was told there were other illnesses reported.

The second case is an adult male from outstate Minnesota. He had bacteremia. He traveled to Minneapolis on February 13, stayed at a hotel near the airport, flew to Florida the next day, stayed at a hotel and then on the next day boarded the same cruise as the first case. He had onset of illness five days into the cruise. He had three travel companions, and two also became ill but no specimens were taken for bacterial culture.

We notified other states and late last Friday night received word from a New England state that they had a PFGE-matched Salmonella Oranienburg case which had been interviewed and had also been on the same cruise; that person also had an ill travel companion.

 Girl Scouts Caught Up in Salmonella Pistachio Recall 
 Posted on April 10, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 It&apos;s been hard to keep up with all the food product recalls related to Salmonella-tainted pistachios grown and roasted in California.

The sweeping domino affect of one large distributor (Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc.) selling more than 1 million pounds of adulterated pistachios to re-baggers and other food companies has now tumbled onto Girl Scouts of the USA . Of all the companies that purchased the wholesale pistachios, only one of them did microbiological testing that found the problem and reported it. And it wasn&apos;t the Girl Scouts.

Ashdon Farms of Waukesha, Wisconsin, has recalled certain code dates of 7.5 ounce Girl Scouts Pistachios packed in pop top cans. The company&apos;s recall notice said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the potentially contaminated nuts.

The pistachios were sold for fund-raising purposes by Girl Scout Councils in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisana, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Almost all of the cans were sold between October and early December 2008.

 The complete list of all pistachio product recalls is being kept by the Food and Drug Administration.

 Salmonella Peanut Plant Fined $14.6 million 
 Posted on April 9, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 The State of Texas has leveled a $14.6 million fine against the peanut processing plant in Plainview owned by Peanut Corp. of America -- the company blamed for a national Salmonella outbreak associated with nine deaths and 700 illnesses.

Virginia-based Peanut Corp. is in bankruptcy and is facing a Salmonella wrongful death lawsuit filed by PritzkerOlsen, P.A., a national food safety law firm that represents the families of three women who died in the outbreak.

The Peanut Corp. processing plant most closely associated with the outbreak is located in Georgia, but Texas officials investigated the plant in Plainview before it closed Feb. 9. They found unsanitary conditions, product contamination, illnesses linked to the plant&apos;s peanuts and operating without a food manufacturer&apos;s license.

The notice of violation and fine was sent by the Texas Department of State Health Services .

 Salmonella in Sprouts: The Problem Persists 
 Posted on April 7, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul that led to a recall of alfalfa sprouts by Nebraska&apos;s CW Sprouts Inc. is another reminder to consumers that people in high-risk categories for systemic infections should not eat raw sprouts.

 The caution against sprouts for the young, elderly and immuno-compromised has been repeated for more than a decade by both the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . At one point, there was even talk of requiring warning labels on the product. But as the CDC noted in one of its studies of Salmonella contamination of sprouts, people continue to be more likely to view sprouts as a healthy food than as a possible vehicle for Salmonella or E. coli 0157:H7.

For people who continue to eat sprouts, heath officials recommend cooking before eating to reduce risks of illness.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., is involved in the latest sprouts outbreak, representing victims. Besides having a reputation for collecting large sums on behalf of people injured or killed by adulterated food, the firm is devoted to educating the public about food safety issues and advocating for badly needed food safety legislation and increased funding for the federal, state and local agencies charged with protecting our food and enforcing food safety laws. Salmonella lawyers at the firm can be reached at 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or by completing an online case consultation form .

The most recent Salmonella outbreak possibly related to sprouts was announced in early March by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Health investigators found a correlation between ill persons and the consumption of CW Sprouts. The company agreed to a voluntary recall on March 3 but has denied being the source of the outbreak, which has grown to more than 100 confirmed cases mainly centered in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota.

From 1995 through 2001, CDC recorded 15 Salmonella outbreaks caused by contaminated sprouts. In the same period, two E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks were linked to sprouts. In Japan in 1996, contaminated radish sprouts were blamed for the world&apos;s largest recorded outbreak of E. coli -- 6,000 cases.

According to CDC and FDA literature, sprouts can become contaminated with Salmonella or E coli organisms during seed production, germination, processing or consumer handling. Once the bacteria in introduced, the same environmental conditions that are suitable for sprouting are also ideal for increasing bacterial counts.

 Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis (swelling of the lining the heart) and arthritis. Most cases in healthy people resolve without the need for medical attention, but hospitalizations are not uncommon.

 FDA Finds Salmonella At Setton Pistachio Facilities 
 Posted on April 6, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
State and federal food safety inspectors found Salmonella organisms in&quot;critical areas&apos;&apos; of productions facilities at Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc ., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced. 

The inspectors also found the potential of cross-contamination of raw and roasted products, the FDA said in a press release.

Setton responded by expanding its recall alert to consumers. Initially, the California grower, aggregator and roaster of pistachios had announced pistachio recalls by lots. Now the company is recalling all roasted, shelled pistachios and all roasted in-shell pistachios from its 2008 crop year -- a harvest of more than 1 million pounds.

Setton&apos;s raw in-shell pistachios were not included in the latest recall, which the company said was&quot;due to potential contamination with the Salmonella organism.&apos;&apos;

 Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, the elderly and other people with weakened immune systems. For example, in the unrelated peanut butter Salmonella outbreak, nine people have died and more than 700 have been sickened since September.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., is representing victims of Salmonella around the country, including the families of three women who died in the peanut-related outbreak.. The firm is experienced and highly regarded for obtaining compensation for victims of food poisoning. In addition, the firm is devoted to educating the public about food safety issues and advocating for badly needed food safety legislation and increased funding for the federal, state and local agencies charged with protecting our food and enforcing food safety laws. To contact a Salmonella lawyer at PritzkerOlsen, call 1-888-377-8900 (toll free) or complete a free online case consultation form. 

Setton&apos;s 2008 crop was distributed around the country, mostly in commercial quantities of up to 1 ton in size. Customers re-bagged the nuts or used them to make other food products. The FDA is instructing Setton&apos;s customers to issue recalls on any affected products. So far, nearly 200 products have been recalled and many more announcements will result from the expanded recall, the FDA said. Entries are being tracked in a searchable FDA database. 

The complete, expanded recall by Setton also applies to retail-sized packages ranging from five-pound&quot;craft bags&quot;of&quot;Setton Farms&quot;roasted and salted pistachios to 16-ounce bags of&quot;Trader Joe&quot;Chili Lemon pistachios.

 12,000 Pounds of Salmonella Egg Rolls Recalled 
 Posted on April 4, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
 A Haywood, California, company is recalling 12,460 pounds of frozen chicken egg rolls because they contain black pepper associated with a Salmonella outbreak in western states that has sickened at least 42 people.

The egg rolls were made by EDS Wrap and Roll Foods LLC. The pepper spice was made and previously recalled by Union International Food Co. of Union City, California. EDS made its recall announcement in conjunction with USDA&apos;s Food Safety and Inspection Service .

 Salmonella  is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail and elderly people. Infection symptoms include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

The outbreak related to United International&apos;s white and black pepper -- some of which was sold in bulk to restaurants and food manufacturers -- has sickened people in California, Oregon, Nevada and Washington. The recalled spices were sold under the Uncle Chen and Lian How brands.

The frozen chicken egg rolls recalled by EDS were produced between July 28, 2008 and March 27, 2009 and bear case codes&quot;80210 through 80365&quot;or&quot;90001 through 90089.&quot;The packages bear the establishment number&quot;P-20350&quot;within the USDA Mark of Inspection printed on the side of the packages.

They were sold in 9.38-pound packages containing 100 1.5-ounce chicken egg rolls and 18.75 pound packages containing 100 3-ounce chicken egg rolls.

If you or someone you know became ill from products containing Uncle Chen or Lian How pepper, national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., can advise you of your legal right to compensation.

 Salmonella Sprouts Lawsuit; Outbreak Grows 
 Posted on April 3, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The multi-state  Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has grown to more than 120 confirmed cases and national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is continuing to hear from victims of the outbreak. 

The firm, which is involved in virtually every major outbreak of foodborne illness, is representing victims in claims against  CW Sprouts Inc. of Nebraska.

It was early March when the Nebraska Department of Public Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first made the initial association between Salmonella Saintpaul infections and CW Sprouts&apos; SunSprout products.

The company on March 3, 2009, recalled its alfalfa sprouts, onion sprouts and gourmet sprouts in an alfalfa sprouts recall announced in conjunction with the FDA. It was reported that the outbreak strain of Salmonella was found in patients in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and Colorado.

In mid-March, for instance, the South Dakota Department of Health announced 29 illnesses believed to be caused by the sprouts. The agency said 14 percent of the people had been to the hospital for treatment. Salmonella infection is potentially fatal for young children, the elderly and other people with weakened immune systems.

The sprouts were sold under the Sun Sprouts label in 4-ounce clear plastic clam shell containers.

 Setton Expands Salmonella Pistachio Recall 
 Posted on April 3, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
An affiliate of the California company at the center of a nationwide Salmonella recall of pistachio products issued a supplemental recall today covering 19 different pistachio products, including chocolate covered varieties.

At this stage of the investigation, national food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is telling consumers to heed government advice not to eat any brand of shelled or unshelled pistachios, or any food products containing pistachios. There have been cases of illness that may be associated with contaminated pistachios and PritzkerOlsen currently is representing Salmonella victims from around the country in other outbreaks. 

Setton International Foods Inc. of Commack, N.Y., announced the voluntary recall in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), but the company said it was not related to recent state health inspection findings. 

Setton International Foods Inc. is an affiliate of California-based Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc. The FDA is investigating Salmonella contamination in bulk, wholesale pistachios from the 2008 crop year roasted and distributed by Setton Pistachio.

All together, the FDA has estimated that 1 million pounds of pistachios from Setton are being recalled.

The New York affiliate of Setton said its recall was related to pistachios it had obtained from the California operation.&quot;This voluntary recall is not in any way related to any inspection conducted by New York State or the United States Food and Drug Administration,&apos;&apos; the company&apos;s recall notice said.

The Associated Press reported this week that the New York affiliate of Setton failed its state health inspection last month because authorities found cockroaches and rodent droppings in the plant. Company officials have said they have remedied the problems.

The 19 products involved in Friday&apos;s recall are listed in full on the FDA&apos;s web site. The list includes&quot;Certified Delicious Dark Chocolate Pistachios&apos;&apos; under the Setton Farms brand.

 Salmonella Pistachio Product Recalls Growing 
 Posted on April 1, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
CONSUMER ALERT: FDA is advising consumers not to eat any brand of shelled or unshelled pistachios, or any food products containing pistachios, such as baked goods, trail mix, and other snack foods, until FDA determines which pistachios and pistachio products are affected by the recall being conducted by Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella, Inc. (&quot;Setton&quot;), also called Setton Farms. 
 
Fisher brand pistachios are among the latest products recalled as a result of Salmonella pistachio contamination found in bulk wholesale shipments from Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc. in California.

 The number of entries in the searchable master list of pistachio product recalls has quickly grown to at least 65.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) said again on Wednesday that several illnesses reported by consumers may be associated with contaminated California pistachios, but more testing is being conducted. Health investigators are trying to determine if any of the strains of Salmonella found in Setton Pistachio nuts are linked to an outbreak.

Setton, a large roaster and distributor of California-grown pistachios, has halted production and is expected by the FDA to issue a voluntary recall involving 1 million pounds of product. The company that detected and blew the whistle on the contamination was Kraft Foods of Illinois, a large customer of Setton.

Kraft expanded its own related recall on Wednesday by announcing that all Planters brand and Back to Nature brand products containing pistachio nuts should not be consumed.

The Fisher recall, issued Wednesday by John B. Sanfilippo and Son Inc., applies to 1.75-ounce packages of dry roasted natural pistachios and 25-pound lots of natural California pistachios sold to fund-raisers, bulk food stores and re-baggers. Minnesota and Wisconsin were in the affected territory of the Fisher brand recall for the small packages and bulk items.

The FDA fully expects the list of recalled pistachio products to expand, much like has happened in the 7-month-old Salmonella  outbreak related to peanut products sold by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA).  That&apos;s because PCA and Setton sold largely to the wholesale market and their products were used as ingredients to make other food.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A., is representing victims of the peanut butter Salmonella outbreak, including the families of three women who died from their illnesses. The firm, which is involved on behalf of victims and survivors in virtually every major outbreak of foodborne illness, is gathering information on the potential pistachio Salmonella outbreak.

 White Pepper &quot;Link&apos;&apos; to Salmonella Outbreak Cited 
 Posted on March 31, 2009 by PritzkerLaw 
The Washoe County Health District in northern Nevada and health officials from Carson City, Nevada, say that investigators have linked&quot;Uncle Chen&quot;brand white pepper to a four-state outbreak of Salmonella. 

A broader association had been drawn to white and black pepper made by Union International Food Co., under the&quot;Uncle Chen&quot;and&quot;Lian How&apos;&apos; labels. But in a press release Tuesday labeled&quot;hot&quot;news, the county and city said the outbreak was specifically linked to&quot;Uncle Chen&apos;&apos; white ground pepper.

The authorities warned consumers to avoid the seasoning and instructed restaurants and grocery stores to remove it.

 &quot;Ground white pepper products from the Union International Food Co. have been linked to a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella . The discovery of Salmonella in food samples collected from restaurants and food distributors prompted these recommendations,&apos;&apos; the press release said.

So far, investigators have confirmed 33 illnesses in California, four in northern Nevada, four in the area of Portland, Oregon, and one in Washington state. As part of the public health response to the outbreak (which has included eight hospitalizations) the California Department of Public Health has disclosed a list of Union International&apos;s customers , mostly in California.

Union International has recalled its black and white peppers, along with other seasonings ranging from tumeric to wasabi powder.

National food safety law firm PritzkerOlsen, P.A ., has been monitoring the outbreak. The firm has considerable experience and a reputation for success in representing survivors of foodborne illnesses. The firm also is devoted to educating the public about food safety issues and advocating for badly needed food safety legislation and increased funding for the federal, state and local agencies charged with protecting our food and enforcing food safety laws.
