I always order the beef or chicken teriyaki for lunch but a friend told me to try the Chicken Katsu. It is a lightly breaded chicken breast served w/ rice and salad. It is excellent and I would recommend this dish. Also get a veg spring roll they are really good. Just make sure to ask for extra sauce on everything!

Three of us went for lunch. The tables were pretty clean. The food was just ok. It was a little expense given what we ordered. We got our food pretty quick. This is fast food with plastic trays. The food was served on plates not paper plates.
The serving were big. It had Teriyaki Chicken. The Chicken was a little crunchy and made me suspicious as to how fresh it was. Rice was nice Japanese Rice.

A little noisy for talking we were almost shouting.
