 Thibodeau&amp;Freier 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Auditing and Accounting Cases: Investigating Issues of Fraud and Professional Ethics , 3rd Edition. Jay C. Thibodeau&amp;Deborah Freier (McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2011). 

 The approach used by Thibodeau and Freier emphasizes the substantial benefits of using real-life case examples in helping to impart knowledge related to the practice of auditing. This type of approach has long been acknowledged as a superior manner in which to teach. Since the authors present the concepts of auditing using actual corporate contexts, they seek to provide students with a real-life appreciation of these issues and clearly demonstrate the value of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the post-Sarbanes technical audit guidance. 

 The Third Edition has been updated to reflect all of the major changes happening in today’s society with actual companies such as Enron, WorldCom, Qwest, Sunbeam, that have become synonymous with the capital markets’crisis in confidence. With 45 different short cases, instructors can assign 8 to 9 different cases for each of four different semesters. Add Comment   Knapp - Contemporary Auditing 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Contemporary Auditing: Real Issues and Cases , 9th Edition. Michael C. Knapp (South-Western 2013).
 
 The Ninth Edition of Knapp&apos;s CONTEMPORARY AUDITING: REAL ISSUES AND CASES utilizes real-world cases to highlight the work environment of auditors. These cases help students to identify audit problem areas by using real-world examples and pointing out potential red flags. With thirteen new cases, Knapp&apos;s CONTEMPORARY AUDITING: REAL ISSUES AND CASES contains the most recent, compelling, and up-to-date examples, including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., First Keystone Bank, Foamex International Inc., Phillips Petroleum Company, and Freescale Semiconductor Inc. Five new cases have also been added to the &quot;Audits of High-Risk Accounts&quot; section, examining well-known companies such as General Motors, Lipper Holdings, LLC, Geo Securities, Inc., Belot Enterprises, and Regina Company, Inc. The ninth edition fully integrates all recent risk assessment standards recently adopted by the auditing community.
 
 This casebook can be used to supplement the first undergraduate auditing course, as a primary text for a second undergraduate auditing course, or for a graduate-level auditing seminar. Selected cases in this text are also suitable for use in financial accounting courses and may be customized into a unique casebook at http://www.cengage.com/custom/makeityours/knapp. 

 Add Comment   Arens, Elder&amp;Beasley 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Auditing and Assurance Services: An Integrated Approach , 14th Edition. Alvin Arens, Randal Elder&amp;Mark Beasley (Pearson, 2012).
 
 Auditing and Assurance Services: An Integrated Approach presents an integrated concepts approach that shows students the auditing process from start to finish. This text prepares students for real-world audit decision making by using illustrative examples of key audit decisions, with an emphasis on audit planning, risk assessment processes and collecting and evaluating evidence in response to risks.
 
The fourteenth edition includes coverage of PCAOB Auditing Standards up through AS 15 (the PCAOB’s Risk Assessment Standards), new standards related to auditor responsibilities related to supplementary information included in financial statements (SAS Nos. 119 and 120), and the most up-to-date content in the dynamic auditing environment.
 
 

 Add Comment   Whittington&amp;Pany 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Principles of Auditing&amp;Assurance Services , 18th Edition. Ray Whittington&amp;Kurt Pany (McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012). 

 Whittington/Pany, our market-leading text in the auditing discipline, uses a balance sheet approach, making it particularly straightforward and user-friendly in addressing the auditing profession’s risk-based approach for financial statement audits, as well as for integrated audits of financial statements and internal control. The 18th edition has been thoroughly revised to reflect two major changes in Auditing: The AICPA’s“Clarity Project”and the modification of the CPA exam’s Auditing and Attestation section content. The CPA exam&apos;s coverage of shorter simulations has resulted in the replacement of the &quot;long&quot; simulations in the text with a variety of shorter objective questions. Each chapter of the test bank now includes other objective format questions as well.
 
 Add Comment   Louwers et al. 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Auditing and Assurance Services , 4th Edition. Timothy Louwers, Robert Ramsay, David Sinason, Jerry Strawser&amp;Jay Thibodeau (McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2011). 

 The fourth edition of Auditing&amp;Assurance Services is the most up-to-date auditing text on the market. All chapters and modules in the fourth edition have been revised to incorporate professional standards through SAS 116, AS7, international standards of auditing (ISAs), and unnumbered standards adopted through (July 2009). New terminology from the AICPA’s Clarity Project has been incorporated throughout the book. In addition, all chapters include new problems, Kaplan CPA Review simulations, and comprehensive case questions. Fraud awareness, a thorough understanding of internal controls, and the ability to use technology effectively are the hallmarks of a successful auditor in business today. With Auditing&amp;Assurance Services, 4e, students are prepared to take on auditing’s latest challenges. 

   Add Comment   Messier, Glover&amp;Prawitt 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Auditing and Assurance Services: A Systematic Approach , 7th Edition. William Messier, Steven Glover&amp;Douglas Prawitt (McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2010). 

 Messier employs the audit approach currently being used by auditing professionals. This approach is a direct result of the demands of Sarbanes-Oxley, which has changed the way auditors do their jobs. The approach emphasizes understanding the entity (i.e., the organization or business being audited) and its environment (i.e. industry), and then assessing the business risks faced by the entity and how management controls those risks. This audit process focuses on business processes instead of accounting cycles. This unique and innovative approach has been developed in response to changing market dynamics. The systematic approach, referred to in the subtitle of the text, reflects the early introduction of three basic concepts that underlie the audit process: materiality, audit risk, and evidence; this allows Messier to build upon this model in subsequent chapters. These are central to everything an auditor does and a unique feature of Messier. As such, this approach helps students develop auditor judgment, a vital skill in today’s auditing environment. Add Comment   Rittenberg, Johnstone&amp;Gramling 06/09/2010 0 Comments   Auditing: A Business Risk Approach , 8th Edition. Larry Rittenberg, Karla Johnstone&amp;Audrey Gramling (South-Western, 2012).
 
 The auditing environment continues to change in dramatic ways, and new professionals must be prepared for a high standard of responsibility. Prepare your students for these changes by using Rittenberg/Johnstone/Gramling&apos;s AUDITING: A BUSINESS RISK APPROACH, 8th EDITION. AUDITING 8e explains the importance of understanding business risk, internal controls, and the professional judgment processes. In addition, it focuses more than ever on international audit standards and includes a renewed emphasis on professional skepticism, the review process, and sustainability audits. In addition, students will gain valuable experience by using the professional ACL auditing software, packaged with each new text, as they work with fraud cases. AUDITING 8e helps your students understand the full range of auditing issues in the new global environment.

 I always spend a full week talking about testing revenue transactions. SAS No. 99 requires auditors to presume a risk of revenue fraud. The most recent COSO study, Fraudulent Financial Reporting: 1998-2007 , found that 60 percent of the accounting fraud cases settled by the SEC involved improper revenue recognition.

I assign students to read at least two of the articles listed below under “Examples of Sales Fraud”and identify procedures the auditors should have performed to detect the sales fraud. Each article is excellent. I have used each one many times and have always had good class discussions.

The MicroStrategy and Chase Industries cases require students to evaluate unfamiliar revenue recognition policies. They are good for instructors who want students to practice their professional research skills.

The Vouch and Trace case is good for instructors who do not assign an audit practice set. A website provides a set of sales orders, sales invoices, and shipping documents for students to examine to find seeded misstatements.

 Articles:
 “Auditor Skepticism and Revenue Transactions,”Jimmy Martin, CPA Journal (August 2002): 31-38. This article summarizes several SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases dealing with bill-and-hold transactions, side agreements, improper sales cutoff, sales returns, and fictitious revenue. 

 Examples of Sales Fraud:
 “Accusers Charge Former Chief of HPL Technologies with Fraud,”Mary Anne Ostrom, San Jose Mercury News (September 11, 2002). HPL co-founder David Lepejian forged customers’signatures and altered bank statements to fabricate 80% of HPL’s reported revenues prior to the company’s IPO. 

 “Time Was Money,”Sandra Sugawara, Washington Post (September 28, 2000): E1. Officials at Sirena Apparel Group reset the computer’s clock to put a March 31 date on sales invoices generated in April. 

 “Anatomy of a Fraud,”Mark Maremont, Business Week (September 16, 1996): 90-93. Kurzweil President Bernard Bradstreet forged sales documents and confirmations to record millions of dollars of phony sales. 

 “How Barry Minkow Fooled the Auditors,”Daniel Akst, Forbes (October 2, 1989): 126-132. An entertaining account of how Barry Minkow deceived his auditors into believing that ZZZZ Best was performing building restoration projects. 

 Cases:
 “The Central Florida Emphysema Foundation Audit,”A Case Study of Personal and Professional Responsibility,”Patrick Knipe&amp;Michael Bitter, Issues in Accounting Education (May 2011): 377-89. An in-charge (senior) auditor must decide whether to permit a client to recognize revenue for a large bequest received after year-end.
 
 “Vouch and Trace: A Revenue Recognition Audit Simulation,”Tad Miller and Arline Savage, Issues in Accounting Education (February 2009): 93-103. Students test transactions recorded in a fictitious company’s sales journal using sales orders, invoices, shipping documents and price lists available on the Internet. 

 “Putting the Clock Back: MicroStrategy, Inc.”Patricia Williams&amp;Bruce Koch, Issues in Accounting Education (May 2004): 249-260. Students must evaluate MicroStrategy’s revenue recognition policies. 

 “Chase Industries,”Robert N. West, Issues in Accounting Education (November 1998): 1031-1042. Students must evaluate an audit client’s justification for recording bill-and-hold sales. 
 Add Comment   Inventory 06/04/2010 0 Comments   Inventory
 I show the AICPA video Auditing Inventory on the first day we talk about inventory. It’s the best way I have found to convey the difficulty of walking through a huge warehouse filled with thousands of items and trying to verify that all the items have been identified properly and counted correctly.

I read ASR No. 196 more than 25 years ago when I was in staff training at Deloitte. It is still my favorite example of how not to audit inventory. 

The Straka Internal Auditor article and the Schneider Management Accounting article provide great“teaser”questions for when I have a few minutes left at the end of class.“Imagine you were auditing a timber company that owned thousands of acres of timberland. How would you estimate the volume of wood owned by your client? Or“imagine you were auditing a sand and gravel company whose inventory was piled in enormous mounds 80 feet high and one-quarter mile in diameter. How would you verify the value of your client’s inventory?”

 Articles:
 “Ghost Goods: How to Spot Phantom Inventory,”Joseph T. Wells, Journal of Accountancy (June 2001): 33-36. This article provides advice for assessing the risk of inventory fraud, observing physical inventory counts, and performing analytical procedures related to inventory. 

 “Auditing Timber Assets,”Thomas Straka, Internal Auditor (June 1995): 50-54. This article describes the unique challenges of controlling and auditing timber. 

 “Shoot Your Inventory,”Dennis Schneider, Management Accounting (September 1989): 37-39. This article describes how a sand and gravel company uses aerial photography to measure its inventory. 

 Instructional Video:
 Auditing Inventory , AICPA Product #738912HS. This interactive CPE self-study course includes a video of the physical inventory count at a small electronics manufacturer. 

 Examples of Inventory Misstatements:
 “Aspiring Midas Enmeshes Auditors in Gold Chain,”Jeff Opdyke, Wall Street Journal (March 1, 2002): C1. A gold importer duped his auditors into believing that gold-plated costume jewelry was 24-carat gold. 

 “In the Matter of Seidman&amp;Seidman,” Accounting Series Release No. 196 , Securities and Exchange Commission (September 1, 1976). Auditors from Seidman&amp;Seidman failed to detect that Cenco, Inc.’s inventory was overstated by 50 percent. 

 Cases:
 “Accounting Fraud at CIT Computer Leasing Group, Inc.”Jeffrey Michelman, Victoria Gorman&amp;Gregory Trompeter, Issues in Accounting Education (August 2011): 569-591. This case describes a newly promoted manager’s search for inventory fraud perpetrated by her supervisor. The materials include videotaped interviews with the investigators and prosecutor.
 
 “J&amp;K Fitness Supply Company: Auditing Inventory,”Paul Clikeman, Accounting Education: An International Journal (April 2012): 161-170. Simulated inventory source documents are provided on a web site. Students analyze the count tags, test counts, vendor invoices, and perpetual inventory records to evaluate the client’s inventory account balance.
 
 “Dynamic Data: Corporate Governance and Auditors’Evaluation of Accounting Estimates,”Jeffrey Cohen, Ganesh Krishnamoorthy&amp;Arnold Wright, Issues in Accounting Education (February 2005): 119-128. Students must evaluate whether an inventory writedown is necessary at a high-tech data networking firm. 

 “Perry Drugs Stores, Inc.: Accounting and Control Issues for Inventory in a Retail Environment,”Michael C. Knapp&amp;Carol A. Knapp, Issues in Accounting Education (May 2000): 237-255. Describes Perry’s decision to account for a $20 million book-to-physical inventory adjustment as a change in estimate. Add Comment   Assessing Control Risk 06/04/2010 0 Comments   Assessing Control Risk 
 Internal control evaluation and control risk assessment are the most difficult auditing topics for me to teach. Few of my students have any significant work experience and my school does not require Accounting Information Systems as a prerequisite for Auditing. Consequently, my students know little about business processes, transaction flows, or internal controls. 

The best I can do is ask them to analyze a simple process they can all imagine in their heads–a fast food restaurant. What prevents a cashier from taking money from the drawer? What prevents a cashier from undercharging a friend? What prevents the store manager, who is evaluated based on revenue goals, from recording fictitious sales? 

Some of the best teaching materials for internal controls are listed in the Financial Statement Fraud and Misappropriations of Assets sections of this website. There are several teaching cases that provide completed internal control questionnaires and ask students to assess the risk of fraud, or describe a theft and ask students to identify the internal control weaknesses that permitted the theft to occur.

 Articles:
 “A Fresh Look at Walkthroughs,”Richard Turpen, Internal Auditor (December 2004): 25-27. Describes how to perform a walkthrough to gain an understanding of transaction flow and identify points where financial statement misstatements may occur. 

 “Evaluate the Control Environment,”Michael Ramos, Journal of Accountancy (May 2004): 75-78. This article presents an internal control reliability model that can be used to evaluate a client’s control environment. 

 “Understanding Internal Controls,”Larry Hubbard, Internal Auditor (October 2003): 23-24. A very concise summary of the five components of COSO’s internal control framework. 

 Classroom Exercises:
 “Using a Simple Game to Introduce Accounting Students to Certain Internal Control Concepts,”James Groff, Journal of Accounting Education (1989): 263-269. This four-person game demonstrates the importance of documentation and segregation of duties. 

 Cases:
 “Sunshine Center: An Instructional Case Evaluating Internal Controls in a Small Organization,”Sandra Fleak, Keith Harrison&amp;Laurie Turner, Issues in Accounting Education (November 2010): 709-720. Students apply the COSO framework to identify weaknesses in a child care center’s internal controls. 
 
 Internal Controls: A Compendium of Short Cases,”Constance Lehman, Issues in Accounting Education (November 2010): 741-754. This article presents six short, open-ended internal control cases addressing (1) hiring practices, (2) weaknesses in credit authorization procedures, (3) benefits and risks of new technology, (4) benefits and risks of remote access, (5) disaster recovery, and (6) procedures for employee reimbursements. 
 
 “Blazer Communications: A Procurement Audit Simulation,”James Worrell, Issues in Accounting Education (August 2010): 527-546. Students use generalized audit software to test internal controls over a client’s procurement function. One unique feature of the case is that audio recordings of simulated interviews of client personnel are provided in MP3 format. 
 
 “Fraud at a Public Authority,”William Brucker&amp;James Rebele, Journal of Accounting Education (2010): 26-37. Students must identify the internal control weaknesses that allowed cash to be stolen from a municipal arena.

 “Designing Audit Procedures When Evidence Is Electronic: The Case of e-Ticket Travel Revenue,”A. Faye Borthick&amp;Jack Kiger, Issues in Accounting Education (August 2003): 275-290. Students must identify key internal controls in a paperless environment and design tests of controls. 

 “Developing Risk Skills: An Investigation of Business Risks and Controls at Prudential Insurance Company of America,”Paul Walker, William Shenkir and C. Stephen Hunn, Issues in Accounting Education (May 2001): 291-313. Describes internal control weaknesses at Prudential. Students must apply COSO framework and Elliott Committee risk assessment. 

 “Information Systems Controls and Auditing: Mathra Tool, Inc.”Ingrid Splettstoesser, Issues in Accounting Education (May 1999): 285-291. Students must evaluate the internal controls of a small manufacturing company.
