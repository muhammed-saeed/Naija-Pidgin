 Aries You&apos;re determined to receive the most cards, candy and flowers. Who says sending roses to yourself doesn&apos;t count?

 Taurus A bouquet of dandelions, dime store chocolates and dinner at a fast food restaurant? Relax, it was just a bad dream!

 Gemini You make two dates for the night -- and then backup plans with your friends in case you decide to flake on your original plans.

 Cancer Ooh, there&apos;s nothing like candy heart art and lace doilies to get you going! Martha Stewart&apos;s got nothing on you.

 Leo You are displeased by the single red rose some admirer left on your windshield. Clearly you are worth at least a dozen!

 Virgo You refuse to share the box of chocolates you receive -- what if someone fingers them? What if someone sneezes on your roses?

 Libra You send valentines to everyone you know: your hairdresser, your fourth grade teacher, your manicurist, your manicurist&apos;s cousin You don&apos;t want anyone to feel left out.

 Scorpio Why go out for a fancy dinner when you already have dessert waiting at home? Who knew that a Cupid costume could be so sexy?

 Sagittarius You can&apos;t commit to sending a card -- what if the recipient reads too much into it? You fake temporary amnesia to avoid acknowledging the holiday.

 Capricorn Lacy hearts and syrupy sentiments make you sneeze -- besides, nothing says love like a new electronic organizer!

 Aquarius Manufactured holidays aren&apos;t your cup of decaffeinated herbal tea, but consuming a few vegan chocolates doesn&apos;t make you a conformist, does it?

 Pisces You live for this stuff! The world would be such a better place if we could all just hold hands and share heart-shaped cookies every day.
