 close [x] Hi Everyone,

OK, I know it&apos;s been tough.

2008 was just a few weeks ago and I couldn&apos;t wait to put it behind me like a bad case of the Tijuana sprints I once had.

Now 2009 is in right up in my face like that old guy from Rocky 1 named Mickey telling me &quot;It Aint Ovah Til&apos; It&apos;s Ovah Kid&quot; and when I ask &quot;Yo Mick, When sid Ovah?!&quot; old Mick shouts back &quot;When I Shay It&apos;s Ovah Kid, Jus Keeps Punchin!&quot;

So, every day I &quot;Keeps Punchin&quot; until finally I realize that the rest of the world is Punchin too.

That&apos;s life...Real life and it isn&apos;t getting any better.

I encourage all of you to understand each others struggle. Whether your a realtor or not. On the buyers side of the table or the sellers side of the table. Show some compassion. People are really struggling right now and a little bit of time you devote helping someone won&apos;t hurt you. Like the song says, &quot;you only get what you give&quot;.

In the end you&apos;ll finish this battle (we all face) with some bit of pride when &quot;It&apos;s Ovah&quot; and I think that will put more value inside you than a wad full of cash.

Remember that the next person you hand a dollar to for cleaning your windshield or that takes your order at the fast food restaurant might just be you.

All The Best!
