How Often Do You Eat Fast Food?
 by Kori Ellis | 3 Comments | Share a Tip 
America is definitely a fast food nation, but are things getting worse or better? Some reports show that people are eating more and more nutritious options and steering away from unhealthy fast food.  While other experts say we are eating more fast food than ever. So how about you?

I havent been in a fast food resturant since I was 22. Im 44 now. I dont miss it one bit, as a matter of fact the smell of Mcdonalds, wendys,taco bell,burger king,or any of the others, make me feel like Im going to puke. The food in those places barelty match up to cattle feed. If im hungry and theres no place else but fast food….I just dont eat. Its not hard at all to ignor fast food.

Once a week, and that’s still too much for me. When you work out 4-6 times per week, eating fast food makes you feel like you are just wasting a workout…
