I think this place has good food. It seemed clean, I did not watch the food prep. I have had their italian salads before and the dressing is great. Most recently I had an cold cut hoagie and it was great. My daughter had a slice of pizza and she ate most of it so she definitely enjoyed it.

Disappointed!

Stopped in while visiting Annapolis  for a slice of pizza. Nice and crispy but otherwise tasteless. Not the pizza I used to consider some of the best. Maybe a whole pie would&apos;ve been a truer taste test but if they serve it by the slice it should be as good as a whole pie!

Pizza is home-made and fresh. This is a good mom-and-pop pizzeria. Stick to the pizza and Italian Ice and you&apos;ll love this place. Order anything else and you will be disappointed.

Not sure how this place even survives.  Previous posters definitely summed up my experience as well.  Unless I was a severely hung over college student in need of a carb fix, I would steer clear of this place.

I liked that I could order a veggie slice even though they didn&apos;t have the token baked pizzas displayed for my viewing pleasure.  It seemed that they were actually going to customize my order.  Alas, I opened my sad looking box to find a slice of cheese pizza adorned with canned mushrooms and raw onion and peppers.

The sprinkling of veggies on an already cooked pizza did not result in a tasty treat.  The oven barely warmed the limp slice and the toppings were raw and unappealing.  R U kidding me?   C&apos;mon Maryland, stand up and demand some good pizza.  This place should be ashamed.

I have been going to Three Brothers for over 20 years now. It is a good family-run regional chain. I go there for the pizza and Italian Ice. Both are great.

Other posters must be tourists- in my 20 years, I have rarely seen people actually order anything other than pizza and Italian Ice. Why would you go to a pizza joint for Italian food? I rate the pizza better than Domino&apos;s and Papa John&apos;s, just under Pizza Hut.

I&apos;m in town on business and I decided to drop into this little Italian place I had seen the night before for some dinner.

I walked in around 7ish and there were four tables seated.  Around the door I came in were the remnants of some booths, which were now being used for storage for pizza boxes.  Since I had never eaten at a &quot;3 Brothers Italian Restaurant&quot;, I wasn&apos;t sure if I was supposed to wait to be seated or not.  Finally, a guy appeared behind the counter and asked if he could help me.  I approached the register and read over the menu.  It featured typical Italian-American fare and featured their pizza.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Spaghetti. The &quot;beep&quot;ing donkey who handled my dirty money then proceeded to make my plate of green lettuce, which was also known as a salad.  After he placed a bunch of green lettuce on the plate, he sprinkled on a *very* small amount of shredded cheese and a fistful of croutons.  Some dressing was slopped in a cup and was placed carelessly on top of the lettuce and was spilled by the time he got it five feet back to me.

I was given a paper cup and a plastic tray like you find at a fast food restaurant and was told my meal would be out shortly.  I helped myself to some Pepsi and went to go find a seat.

The decor left a lot to be desired.  Floor to ceiling windows, like that you find in a strip mall (since that&apos;s where this is), which are undecorated save for the occasional neon beer sign.  The dining room was absolutely dreadful.  Near the other door, I could see the day&apos;s delivery of paper goods piled up, most of the tables and chairs had seen better days and the carpet was just disgusting.

I picked at my salad and waited for my hot food to come.  It was an utter mess.   It was a huge blob of congealed cheese and a massive amount of marinara sauce covered diced fried chicken.  There was absolutely no flavor, it was like I was eating cardboard.  There was so much cheese and sauce, I actually had to hunt for the chicken.  When I did find it, it was a major disappointment.  It was like my mom cut it up for me.  The chicken was in small, bite sized pieces and also had no flavor.  The whole dish was ruined by the amount of cheese and sauce.  You could tell that the cheese was of the cheap processed variety.  It just made me sick to continue eating it, I finally gave up and left it.

Midway through my meal, the donkey in the kitchen brought me a plank of half-toasted garlic bread and apologized for the wait on the bread.  How long does it take to half-way  toast bread?  The plank of bread had more flavor than the chicken!

I don&apos;t know if this place was having an off-night or not.  From the look of things (lack of customers, using customer space for storage, etc), I&apos;d say it wasn&apos;t a one-time incident.  I know I would certainly never go back to eat this crap.

In the four years I have lived in Annapolis, I have never seen this place, but I was given a coupon for a free cheese pizza and decided to try it out. I had a very similar experience as other reviewers; the restaurant was completely empty upon arrival (at 11:45 in the afternoon on a holiday), and the place seemed to be falling apart. 90&apos;s-era wallpaper was falling off the wall, open circuit boxes were exposed throughout the store, chairs and tables were dated and falling apart, and the layout was just not-well-thought-out.

The place seemed to be confused about whether it was a delivery business or a sit-down restaurant, and the only worker there who was visible to us after ordering was an older woman who came to work in a dirty polo and gray sweatpants. She hovered around the store wiping off tables and situating the seven different unlabeled seasonings on each table. As we waited at our table not knowing whether to pick up our food or wait for it to be served, she came by and without saying hello or even looking at us, just asked: &quot;what&apos;d ya&apos;ll order?&quot; We told her, and she scurried to the back and brought us the cheese pizza and paper plates, but mentioned we may need to go pick up napkins or plastic cutlery ourselves.

Apart from the generally-unprofessional demeanor of the store and the workers who seemed unprofessional and more motivated to hide behind  the copious amounts of indoor foliage, the store did have the chance at good food. However, like other reviewers have mentioned, food was so-so at best. Though it wasn&apos;t terrible, the pizza was definitely nothing to scream about.

Save yourself the experience and visit Ledo&apos;s or Drydock at the Naval Academy.

Maybe it was my bad for ordering the veal calzone in the first place, but it was terrible.  I didn&apos;t even finish it. I don&apos;t know why I went here since it breaks my cardinal rule of Chains and Strip malls.
