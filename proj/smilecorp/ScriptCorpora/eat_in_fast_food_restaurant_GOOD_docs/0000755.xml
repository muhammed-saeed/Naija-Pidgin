Blockbuster - anyone have a contact number ?
 Sorry if this is in the wrong place.
I quit my Netflix membership two weeks ago because I could never get a movie, and started Blockbuster. Well I&apos;ve rented 5 movies, and alot of the ones I really wanted. I noticed in my &apos;queue&apos; today that Baby Mama wasn&apos;t showing as returned. I returned it at the store. So I emailed them, and they replied back that it was not showing as scanned OR returned. So I call the store, and the manager there says when they scan a movie in, it doesnt&apos; show which movie . So I said...I can point out to you the guy who took this movie from me, and the manager just said to have Blockbuster call him.
I&apos;d like to Call blockbuster to speak to an actual person, because it took them over 24 hours to reach me the first time and I want to get this cleared up. And now I&apos;m worried because what the heck proof do I have that I returned this movie if the people at my blockbuster store didn&apos;t even do their job and scan it in ???
Anyway, does anyone have a contact number ? Reply With Quote 10-24-2008,  05:32 PM #2 jovigirl1228

Or, go to www.search.bbb.org and search on the business name Blockbuster - there will be other results, and some have many, many phone numbers for you to try. Reply With Quote 10-24-2008,  05:50 PM #4 Godspoet

 Registered User Join Date Dec 2004 Location In my little world....shhhh.... Posts 5,833 Why not go into the store in person? I had this happen before&amp;went into the store&amp;took the movie that I returned off the shelf to prove to them that they had it. They said sometimes the scanner doesn&apos;t scan them in if they do it too fast....like right?! I know if it was a New release that may be hard to do since sometimes they have like 50 copies, but in person usually works. Hope you get it worked out, I know it&apos;s aggravating to say the least! 

Also if it&apos;s been checked out since you returned it, then obviously they got it from you. I would ask. Last edited by Godspoet; 10-24-2008 at 05:51 PM . Reply With Quote 10-24-2008,  07:17 PM #5 Smokymist

 1/2007 Join Date Mar 2005 Location East Tennessee Posts 1,872 I will try that tomorrow, but I dont&apos; see how it would make a difference. I spoke to a man on the phone. He looked up my account and told me that they do not have a record of the &apos;names&apos; of the movies that are checked back in, just a number. So he had no idea which movies I had returned 
And it is a newer release, so to pick up a copy of one they have ..probably wouldn&apos;t matter as they have many.
Thank you for looking that up Katland Reply With Quote 10-25-2008,  04:51 AM #6 bufflobreath

 Registered User Join Date Jan 2005 Posts 24 Today when I got home there was a phone message that I did not send back the movie that I rented, I called spoke with a manager and he said it was on the shelf and he was sorry. The other post said the same thing try calling a manager and ask them to check the shelf. Hope this helps. Reply With Quote
