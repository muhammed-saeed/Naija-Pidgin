Landfills

 You have just finished your meal at a fast food restaurant and you throw your uneaten food, food wrappers, drink cups, utensils and napkins into the trash can. You don&apos;t think about that waste again. On trash pickup day in your neighborhood, you push your can out to the curb, and workers dump the contents into a big truck and haul it away. You don&apos;t have to think about that waste again, either. But maybe you have wondered, as you watch the trash truck pull away, just where that garbage ends up. 
 Americans generate trash at an astonishing rate of four pounds per day per person, which translates to 600,000 tons per day or 210 million tons per year! This is almost twice as much trash per person as most other major countries. What happens to this trash? Some gets recycled ( ) or recovered and some is burned, but the majority is buried in landfills. 

How Much Trash Is Generated?
 Of the 210 million tons of trash, or solid waste, generated in the United States annually, about 56 million tons, or 27 percent, is either recycled (glass, paper products, plastic, metals) or composted (ɶѷ) (yard waste). The remaining trash, which is mostly unrecyclable, is discarded.
 How Is Trash Disposed of? The trash production in the United States has almost tripled since 1960. This trash is handled in various ways. About 27 percent of the trash is recycled or composted, 16 percent is burned and 57 percent is buried in landfills. The amount of trash buried in landfills has doubled since 1960. The United States ranks somewhere in the middle of the major countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France and Japan) in landfill disposal. The United Kingdom ranks highest, burying about 90 percent of its solid waste in landfills.

What Is a Landfill? 
There are two ways to bury trash: 
 Dump C an open hole in the ground where trash is buried and that is full of various animals (rats, mice, birds). (This is most peoples idea of a landfill!) 
 Landfill C carefully designed structure built into or on top of the ground in which trash is isolated from the surrounding environment (groundwater, air, rain). This isolation is accomplished with a bottom liner and daily covering of soil. 
o Sanitary landfill C landfill that uses a clay liner to isolate the trash from the environment 
o Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill C landfill that uses a synthetic (plastic) liner to isolate the trash from the environment.
 The purpose of a landfill is to bury the trash in such a way that it will be isolated from groundwater, will be kept dry and will not be in contact with air. Under these conditions, trash will not decompose () much. A landfill is not like a compost pile, where the purpose is to bury trash in such a way that it will decompose quickly. 

Proposing the Landfill
 For a landfill to be built, the operators have to make sure that they follow certain steps. In most parts of the world, there are regulations that govern where a landfill can be placed and how it can operate. The whole process begins with someone proposing the landfill.
 In the United States, taking care of trash and building landfills are local government responsibilities. Before a city or other authority can build a landfill, an environmental impact study must be done on the proposed site to determine: 
 the area of land necessary for the landfill 
 the composition of the underlying soil and bedrock
 the flow of surface water over the site 
 the impact of the proposed landfill on the local environment and wildlife
 the historical value of the proposed site 

Building the Landfill
 Once the environmental impact study is complete, the permits are granted and the funds have been raised, then construction begins. First, access roads to the landfill site must be built if they do not already exist. These roads will be used by construction equipment, sanitation () services and the general public. After roads have been built, digging can begin. In the North Wake County Landfill, the landfill began 10 feet below the road surface.

What Happens to Trash in a Landfill?
 Trash put in a landfill will stay there for a very long time. Inside a landfill, there is little oxygen and little moisture. Under these conditions, trash does not break down very rapidly. In fact, when old landfills have been dug up or sampled, 40-year-old newspapers have been found with easily readable print. Landfills are not designed to break down trash, merely to bury it. When a landfill closes, the site, especially the groundwater, must be monitored and maintained for up to 30 years! 

How Is a Landfill Operated?
 A landfill, such as the North Wake County Landfill, must be open and available every day. Customers are typically municipalities and construction companies, although residents may also use the landfill.
 Near the entrance of the landfill is a recycling center where residents can drop off recyclable materials (aluminum cans, glass bottles, newspapers and paper products). This helps to reduce the amount of material in the landfill. Some of these materials are banned from landfills by law because they can be recycled. 
 As customers enter the site, their trucks are weighed at the scale house. Customers are charged tipping fees for using the site. The tipping fees vary from $10 to $40 per ton. These fees are used to pay for operation costs. The North Wake County Landfill has an operating budget of approximately $4.5 million, and part of that comes from tipping fees.
 Along the site, there are drop-off stations for materials that are not wanted or legally banned by the landfill. A multi-material drop-off station is used for tires, motor oil, lead-acid batteries. Some of these materials can be recycled.
 In addition, there is a household hazardous waste drop-off station for chemicals (paints, pesticides, other chemicals) that are banned from the landfill. These chemicals are disposed of by private companies. Some paints can be recycled and some organic chemicals can be burned in furnaces or power plants.
 Other structures alongside the landfill are the borrowed area that supplies the soil for the landfill, the runoff collection pond and methane () station. 
 Landfills are complicated structures that, when properly designed and managed, serve an important purpose. In the future, new technologies called bioreactors will be used to speed the breakdown of trash in landfills and produce more methane.

Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One 
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 
Tear &apos;em apart! Kill the fool! Murder the referee ( )! 
These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let&apos;s not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations ( ) may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term opponent as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms. 
The dictionary meaning of the term opponent is adversary; enemy; one who opposes your interests. Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one&apos;s intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player&apos;s request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed, Are they wet enough now? 
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent&apos;s intentional and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior. 
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated ( ) the game to the level where it belongs, thereby setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term opponent with associate could be an ideal way to start. 
The dictionary meaning of the term associate is colleague; friend; companion. Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term associate rather than opponent. 
ע⣺˲ ⿨ 2 
57. Which of the following statements best expresses the author&apos;s view? 
A) The words people use can influence their behavior. 
B) Unpleasant words in sports are often used by foreign athletes. 
C) Aggressive behavior in sports can have serious consequences. 
D) Unfair judgments by referees will lead to violence on the sports field. 
58. Harsh words are spoken during games because the players ________. 
A) are too eager to win 
B) treat their rivals as enemies 
C) are usually short-tempered and easily offended 
D) cannot afford to be polite in fierce competitions 
59. What did the handball player do when he was not allowed a time out to change his gloves? 
A) He angrily hit the referee with a ball. 
B) He refused to continue the game. 
C) He claimed that the referee was unfair. 
D) He wet his gloves by rubbing them across his T-shirt. 
60. According to the passage, players in a game may ________. 
A) kick the ball across the court with force 
B) lie down on the ground as an act of protest 
C) deliberately throw the ball at anyone illegally blocking their way 
D) keep on screaming and shouting throughout the game 
61. The author hopes to have the current situation in sports improved by ________. 
A) regulating the relationship between players and referees 
B) calling on players to use clean language on the court 
C) raising the referees&apos; sense of responsibility 
D) changing the attitude of players on the sports field
