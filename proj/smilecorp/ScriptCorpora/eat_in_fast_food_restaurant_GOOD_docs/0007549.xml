 fact : 

Producing a single hamburger uses enough fossil fuel to drive a small car 20 miles and enough water for 17 showers.

 tip : 

Why not order a veggie burger instead? They&apos;re just as tasty, and every little bit helps when it comes to reducing your carbon footprint. Plus, you might even be able to afford some onion rings!

Reduce the poop! Go veg! To help you out, order a free copy of our &quot;Vegetarian Starter Kit,&quot; which is full of recipes and other info to get you started. Did we mention that it also comes with free stickers and a DVD with band interviews?
