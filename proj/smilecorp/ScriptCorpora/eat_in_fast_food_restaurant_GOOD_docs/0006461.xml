 Car crash lawyer obtains $25,000 policy limits settlement for Chicago woman 
 | Share 
 Injury attorneys at Abels&amp;Annes have resolved a case for an Illinois resident. This claim arises out of an automobile collision which took place on August 30, 2010 at approximately 5:00 p.m.

Our client was driving southbound on Cumberland, approaching Bryn Mawr in Chicago, Illinois. The defendant was driving northbound on Cumberland approaching Bryn Mawr. The intersection of Cumberland and Bryn Mawr is controlled by a four-way stop light. The plaintiff had a green light at Bryn Mawr so she entered the intersection and continued driving southbound.

The at fault driver intended to make a left turn from Cumberland onto westbound Bryn Mawr. The defendant failed to yield the right-of-way to our client and entered the intersection when it was not safe to do so. He turned into her path and hit the front end of her vehicle with the front passenger side of her own. The force of the impact jolted the plaintiff forward and back violently in her seat.

The Chicago Police Department responded to the scene of the collision and determined the defendant was at fault. The negligent driver received a citation for failure to yield the right-of-way at an intersection while turning left.

We alleged to the defendant&apos;s insurance carrier that their insured failed to keep a proper lookout, was driving at an excessive rate of speed, failed to yield the right-of-way at an intersection before making a left hand turn, and failed to exercise due care for the safety of those in the area, including the Plaintiff. Based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the occurrence at issue, it was clear that the sole proximate cause of the collision was the negligent conduct of their insured.

Following the incident the plaintiff had an onset of back, neck and abdominal pain. She was 31 weeks pregnant at the time of the collision.

She was taken from the scene of the occurrence by ambulance to Resurrection Medical Center ’s Emergency Department. A history was taken, she was examined and diagnostic tests were performed. She complained of abdominal pain and pressure and was concerned about her pregnancy. She also had pain in her back that radiated down into her left leg. She was discharged and instructed to follow up with a physician as needed.

Due to ongoing and increasing pain, she followed up with a doctor on September 1, 2010. She complained of headaches, pain, stiffness, and numbness in her neck, radiating numbness to both shoulders, severe lower back pain radiating to both legs, and left leg pain. A history was taken and she was examined. She had severe tenderness and muscle spasms on palpation over her cervical spine and thoracic spine muscles, tenderness in both shoulders and severe tenderness in her lumbar spine. She also had limited range of motion in her cervical and lumbar spine. Diagnosed her with musculoligamentous injuries of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine as well as sciatic and contusion of the head. Due to her pregnancy, a course of physical therapy was recommended and she was instructed to follow up for more treatment.

Our client returned to her physican on September 24, 2010. At that time, she continued to complain of headaches, neck numbness and stiffness, severe lower back pain that radiated into both legs, and radiating numbness in her shoulders. Her injuries were so significant that she was having trouble concentrating and sleeping. The doctor again examined her and maintained a diagnosis of musculoligamentous injuries of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine as well as head contusion. As she was 34 weeks pregnant, he instructed her to stop physical therapy for the time being and to resume physical therapy after she delivered her baby.

The plaintiff next treated on December 1, 2010, where she continued to complain of severe pain in her low back that radiated into her left leg. On exam, she had severe tenderness and limited range of motion in her lumbar spine. She was with musculoligamentous lumbosacral spine strain and instructed her to return to physical therapy.

She returned to physical therapy for a period of time.

The claim settled for the defendant&apos;s insurance policy limits of $25,000.

 Chicago injury attorney representing woman hurt in collision 
 | Share 
A Chicago car accident lawyer at Abels&amp;Annes is currently representing a local woman who was injured in an October 27, 2011 crash. The plaintiff was hurt when the Toyota Corolla she was driving was rear-ended by Ford Fusion driven by the defendant.

Our client was driving eastbound on I-90 in Chicago, Illinois, near Sayre. Traffic began to slow down and she brought her vehicle to a stop behind another car.

The defendant was also driving eastbound on I-90, behind the Toyota. He failed to slow down for traffic and rear-ended her. The force of the collision caused the plaintiff to hit her chest on the steering wheel.

The Illinois State Police Department responded to the scene of the collision. After speaking with both parties, the responding officer determined the defendant was at fault for causing the collision. The responding officer issued the defendant a citation for driving too fast for conditions/failure to reduce speed to avoid a collision. The officer also determined that he was following the plaintiff too closely and that he had a lack of driving skills, experience and/or knowledge that contributed to the collision.

We are arguing to the defendant&apos;s insurance carrier that their insured failed to keep a proper lookout, drove too fast for conditions, failed to reduce his speed to avoid a collision, followed too closely, and failed to exercise due care for the safety of those in the area, and that based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the occurrence at issue, it is clear that the sole proximate cause of the collision was the negligent conduct the insured.

Following the collision, the client had an immediate onset of neck pain, back pain, and right arm pain. She was transported from the scene of the occurrence by ambulance to the Resurrection Hospital Emergency Department. At the ER, a history was taken and she was examined. She complained of neck pain and back pain and underwent x-rays of her cervical spine which showed a straightening of the normal cervical lordosis. She was prescribed pain medication and muscle relaxants and instructed to seek follow up care.

Due to ongoing and increasing pain, the plaintiff sought follow up treatment from a medical doctor on October 29, 2011. At that time, she complained of neck pain, back pain, right arm pain, chest pain, and constant headaches. The pain was affecting her sleep and was worse with prolonged sitting or movement. Her physician took a history and examined her. She had tenderness to palpation over C1-7, T1-12, and L1-S1. She had tenderness to both sacroiliac joints, upper trapezius muscles and bilateral gluteals. The doctor noticed muscle spasms in her cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines as well as multiple trigger points.

 Chicago auto accident attorneys set to file Cook County lawsuit 
 | Share 
While Illinois injury lawyers at our office are usually able to settle most claims out of court, sometimes insurance carriers are unreasonable and lawsuits need to be filed. Here are the facts of one case that is headed to Court in Cook County .

The claim arises out of a Chicago automobile collision which took place in December, 2010. Our client was injured when the automobile he was driving was hit head-on by a 2000 Chevy Impala driven by the defendant.

The plaintiff was driving eastbound on Grand Avenue in his 2008 Ford 250 approaching its intersection with Mulligan. The defendant was driving westbound on Grand, approaching its intersection with Mulligan.

As our client was driving straight and had the right-of-way, he proceeded into the intersection at Mulligan. The Chevy driver failed to yield the right-of-way and turned left, hitting the front of the plaintiff&apos;s vehicle with the front passenger’s side of his vehicle. The force of the impact was so great that it pushed the Ford off the road and into a parked car.

The Chicago Police Department responded to the scene of the collision. After speaking with both parties, the police determined the collision was the result of the other driver&apos;s failure to yield the right of way. They ticketed the negligent driver.

Following the collision, our client had an immediate onset of neck, back and head pain.

Shortly after the crash he sought medical treatment from a doctor. Our client complained of pain in his back, neck and head as well as pain in his knee. A history was taken and he was examined. Upon exam, he had paraspinal tenderness that was most severe at L4-S1, left knee pain and limited range of motion in his left knee. The physician diagnosed him with bursitis, contusion, and a knee injury, prescribed him pain medication, and instructed him to follow up as needed.

Due to ongoing and increasing pain, he sought follow up medical care with another doctor on December 22, 2010. At that time, he continued to complain of neck pain, headaches, and back pain. A history was taken and he was examined, revealing tenderness to palpation over C1-7, T1-12, L1-S1 and bilateral sacroiliac joints, tenderness to palpation over the bilateral trapezius muscles and the occipital region of the head. The physician noted subluxations throughout his cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine as well as muscle spasms along the spine, severe at the cervical level. His range of motion was limited in his cervical and lumbar spine. He ordered x-rays of our client&apos;s cervical and lumbar spine, which revealed a loss of normal cervical lordosis and pelvic and sacral unleveling.
