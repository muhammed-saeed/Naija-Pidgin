Several restaurants are trying to make your life easier by offering some free food and drinks on Tax Day.


Tax Day hits like a ton of bricks Tuesday and tired souls who have just lost a pretty penny filing their taxes may be in no mood to shell out cash for meals.

Luckily, many restaurants have recognized the doom and gloom of Tax Day and are offering patrons some terrific deals, including several free food giveaways.

Here is a list of businesses, compiled with the help of Eater.com&apos;s Amy McKeever , willing to serve you a deal Tuesday.

 Sonic (America&apos;s Drive-In) - Typically, Sonic offers a daily happy hour that features half-price drinks for a short time in the afternoon. On Tax Day, the restaurant is extending happy hour all day. Some fresh fruit slushes price for just $1 meaning a refreshing Tax Day drink can be had for 50 cents. No coupon is necessary.

 Panda Express - The Chinese fast food restaurant recently introduced a new item, Shanghai Angus Steak. To get the word out and help customers through Tax Day, Panda Express will be giving a free serving of the new item to all customers who &quot;like&quot; the company on Facebook.

 Arby&apos;s - The fast food chain known for its roast beef has two ways to help customers through Tax Day. First, Arby&apos;s is offering free curly fries to all patrons who print a coupon from the company&apos;s Facebook page. Additionally, one lucky customer will win $5,000, a sweet reward to make Tax Day a little more pleasant.

 Seattle&apos;s Best Coffee - Seattle&apos;s Best Coffee cafes are offering customers a no-strings-attached free cup of joe to anyone who comes into their shops on Tax Day. All that is needed is a printed coupon from the coffee company&apos;s Facebook page.

 Cinnabon - Got a sweet tooth? Cinnabon wants to provide dessert on Tax Day, offering two free Cinnabon Bites to all customers. The deal is available from 6 to 8 p.m. and requires no coupon or purchase.

 Chili&apos;s - If you&apos;re looking to take a step up for a sit-down meal on Tax Day, Chili&apos;s is offering a free appetizer or dessert with any entree purchase. The deal runs on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Boston Market - Through an offer on its company website, Boston Market is giving away a free individual meal when an individual meal and a soft drink is purchased. Customers must bring in the coupon from the website to score the deal.
