 Secrets Section 1: 
The Secrets to a Profitable Affiliate Website 

Building
a profitable affiliate website requires the understanding of basic
website and marketing principles. (If you don’t know how to build a
website that will be covered here )
First of all you need to build a website that sells. It is vital to
create a website that is focused on your niche product and not filled
with endless amounts of information. This is just one tip to help you
create a lucrative website.

Whether
you are just stepping into the world of earning money on the Internet
or a seasoned professional, you will want to read this section to
ensure that you are maximizing your websites profit.

Following are six tasks you must complete correctly in order to craft a profitable affiliate website:
 
 Task #1: What is your niche market? 
 
You
need to identify your potential customers and clients. It is critical
to find your niche and market it to its full extent. Focusing on your
niche market will reel in more customers because you aren’t barraging
them with extra information that they don’t need.

Shy
away from websites that cover a wide range of topics. You want to
establish yourself as a leader in a niche market that is under served
online. You should find a suitable niche market that currently has less
then one million websites on the Internet. This drop in competition
will help you grab more of the customers that search for your keywords
and phrases regarding your product or business. Plus, you have a better
chance of a higher search engine ranking.
 
 Task #2: Create a website of substance. 
 
A
website is not merely a reserved parking spot on the Internet, but a
means of communicating the services and products you have to offer.
Potential customers are interested in your niche area and will also
crave informational articles about your product or service. Therefore,
you need to provide web article content.

It
is comforting to a customer to see that you have invested time in
supplying them“free”information through these articles. Plus, you
will improve your free search engine ranking by incorporating niche
keywords and phrases into your website content.

Where
can you find articles to post on your website and how much do they
cost? The good news is that you can find FREE articles on the Internet
through a wide variety of sources. The vast supply of free articles
will keep your website filled with pertinent information on a daily or
weekly basis.

Following are a list of websites where you can access a plethora of free website articles:

 www.article-emporium.com www.ezinearticles.com www.articlecity.com www.goarticles.com www.articlesource.com www.ideamarketers.com articles.simplysearch4it.com www.freezinesite.com www.articlesubmission.com www.valuablecontent.com 
 
 Task #3: Seek out the cream of the crop affiliate programs. 
 
Affiliate
programs can definitely build your bank account. That is, if you join
the BEST affiliate programs. Don’t just join affiliate programs on a
whim, though, join the ones that will make you money.

Confused
about which affiliate programs to become part of? You’re in luck
because I have created a list of the affiliates you should join.

 CREAM OF THE CROP AFFILIATE PROGRAM RESOURCES: 

Following is a list of affiliate programs that you should join:

 LinkShare –This affiliate website is worthy as it is used by several highly profitable, recognizable companies.

 Commission Junction –This affiliate is the leader in selling products such as clothing and computers.

 SECOND PLACE AFFILIATE PROGRAMS: 
While not the cream of the crop, these affiliate programs are still worth considering. They include:

 ClickxChange –This affiliate program is comprised of several small advertisers.

 WebSponsors –This affiliate runs a lot of email offers with“free”extras.

 Performics –This affiliate provides quality brick&amp;mortar based business opportunities.

 ClixGalore –This affiliate offers a multi-leveled network that has a respectable amount of diversity.

Peruse
these affiliate program resources to find affiliate programs to invest
your time and energy into. You can speed up this process by checking
the Earnings-per-Click”(EPC) for each program and select the program
that has the highest EPC rating. Each affiliate program resource
website might state their EPC with another term.
 
 Task #4: Offer Incentives for Customers 
 
Customers
will flock to what they perceive as a great deal. A rebate off the
regular price is a great way to do that. Many times popular products
have earned name recognition. Customers often type the product’s name
into search engines in order to find your affiliate product.

When
they do find your affiliate website, you can hook them with a rebate.
Let’s say that you earn a 60% commission on a popular product. You
could feasibly offer this product to customers at a 25% discount off of
the regular price. A customer will jump at the chance to receive a
discount.

Don’t give the
discount immediately however. Offer a 25% rebate instead. Why? Offering
the 25% discount up front will guarantee that you sell them the product
for a lower price, but a rebate of 25% on the other hand is not often
utilized. For one reason or another people do not often follow up on
the rebate. Only about 15-20% of customers remember to send in the
rebate. This is to your advantage.

As
example, let’s say the product costs $100. Your commission is 60% so
you will earn $60. You can offer a rebate of 25% that amounts to $25
off. Therefore, if the customer takes you up on the rebate offer then
you will make $35. However, like I said, most customers do not follow
through with the rebate so you earn $60 even though you initially
hooked them with the 25% rebate.

How
should you offer the rebate? Explain that if the customer orders
directly from your website link that the rebate is valid. Request that
they send in a receipt regarding their purchase. State that the rebate
is valid 60 days after purchase. You&apos;ll want to make sure to wait until
60 days have passed to make sure they haven&apos;t already requested a
refund. It is very easy to pay a rebate through Paypal or by
old-fashioned check.

If you are risk taker you can increase the rebate amount. It is up to your level of risk aversion and experience.

It
is true that anyone could purchase a program through their own
affiliate link and have massive savings up to 75%. But guess what? Most
people don’t realize they can save money doing this. So point them to
your affiliate link instead.

The
major benefit of offering a rebate is that it distinguishes your
affiliate from other competing affiliates. There maybe several other
affiliates selling the same product, but you are selling the product at
a discount price (with the rebate).
 
 Task #5: Cash in on lead generation. 
 
Sales
may be the number one thing on your mind as an affiliate. But don’t
forget about generating leads. Why? Generating leads will put more
money in your pocket, plain and simple.

How
do you generate a lead? Leads can be generated by first offering free
information for a product or service. Next you follow up with a contact
information capture form that forces the customer to fill out lead
forms in order to access the free information.

Let’s
say, for example, that you wanted to create sales leads for a health
product. You can attract customers with the option of viewing free
information and research regarding the health product. However, before
they can view the free information they must first fill out a no
obligation form regarding the health product. This is known as a“forced lead”.

This lead from
your affiliate page is a benefit for the health product company. You
should be compensated for your lead. Many companies do not want to
spend money on forced leads. However, you can work with them to explain
that you are giving free related information. They may then approve
your lead generation and compensate you for your effort.

Offering
free information is beneficial to everyone. You will benefit from the
lead generation fee. Your customer will benefit from learning more
about the product or service for free. The company that owns the
product or service will have a lead to follow up on for an actual sale
of their product.

What companies have established pay-per-lead networks? Following are five companies to get you started:

 Commission Junction LinkShare ClickxChange ClixGalore 
 
 Task #6: Build your affiliate website. 
 
Building
a website has never been easier. There are many programs on the market
that allow you to create a dynamic website quickly and relatively
cheaply. Many website building programs are geared for the
non-technical person meaning you don’t necessarily have to know how to
program in HTML to create a robust website.

Check out these website building programs to help you create the website:
 
 Site Sell.com –Let Site Sell.com do the work of building an affiliate website for
you. They will customize it to your niche market. Programming
experience is not required and this program is around $300.

 Plug in Profits –Set up your affiliate website with tutorials and extensive customer support. Create a website that fits your niche market.

 XsitePro –This is an awesome website building program. It has all the bells and
whistles including creating and a website to sell your own products,
affiliate products, or a website traffic tool. Another great benefit is
that no programming experience is required. You can get this program
for around $200 and it well worth it.
 
Perhaps
you don’t have the time, energy or the know-how to build your website.
Seeking out qualified website designers and programmers will ensure
that your website is top notch.

You can outsource this task to a website programmer on Elance or a ScriptLance .
Both of these sites allow you to create a project in which skilled
professionals from around the globe will place bids for building your
website. A major benefit of these resources is that you can benefit
from their professional experience at an inexpensive price. It&apos;s not
uncommon to have a complete website built for only 100 - 300 U.S.
Dollars.

 Seal of approval …Don’t forget that you want to convey that you have a legitimate
business through your website. A great way to accomplish this is by
applying for seals of approval companies like the Better Business
Bureau. Your customer will feel much more confident about your business
and services if you have been prescreened by the Better Business Bureau
which will lead to more sales.

The
Better Business Bureau is not the only resource to seek approval from.
You can garner seals of approval and awards from the following websites:

 Truste Better Business Bureau 

 Task #7: Creating a site that SELLS! 

I personally think the easiest way to get your first profitable website
is to start with a“Review”website on digital products. Build your
website simply and quickly. Write reviews about other digital products.
The beauty of a review website is that you don’t have to worry about
customer complaints. The product merchant is responsible for the
effectiveness of the product, not you. You are merely providing a
review.

Creating your website is at
the heart of starting your online business and the next step is to
write a slam dunk sales letter. Sales letters play a key role in your
financial success. The sales letter must be gripping, interesting, and
communicate the necessary information to your customer.

You’ve
most likely read sales letters for products or services in the past.
Some sales letters you came across were horrible, while others prompted
you to buy right on the spot. So how do you write an effective sales
letter?

A sales letter must include following components to convert a lead to a sale:
 
 Display Optimism Exhibit Neutrality Demonstrate Expertise Stress Immediacy Scare Them a Bit Reverse Psychology 

 Display Optimism: 
We live in a culture of the desire for quick results with little or no
effort. This mentality hooks customers in by the thousands. Think of
all the weight loss advertisements in which customers claim they tried“every”diet plan out there and found out that this specific program
was the best for them. The keyword is“every”diet plan. Customers will
stop at nothing to try any diet program or product on the market until
they can fix their problem.

This
is good news because they are willing to try your program, product, or
service in their journey to success. Display optimism by communicating
that there is still hope for their situation. Explain that your product
is“the”product they have been looking for and it is a step above the
rest. The customer wants to hear that all their problems will be solved
by using your product.

By
displaying optimism you are latching onto your customer’s emotional
heart strings. They may feel depressed and desperate and your product
could save them from their misery. This quick fix is what they are
looking for.

In the diet
program example many customers buy a diet program, stick to it for a
short time and then fall off the bandwagon. They may determine that the
program is too hard to stick to, not effective, or they are just plain
sick of it. This applies to several different eBooks as well.

YOu
can offer your money back guarantee because you will often find
customers that buy an eBook thinking it will solve all their problems
and they don’t even end up reading it after they purchase it. They are
not likely to not require a refund if they skip reading the ebook
altogether. It is a form of procrastination that is good for your
bottom line.

 Exhibit Neutrality: 
An effective sales letters promotes your product without pushing it
down a customer’s throat. The customer doesn’t want to read only your
review of the product because it’s your product and you will appear
biased. They want a“second opinion”from a neutral source.

You
can appear neutral by stating typical customer situations and how your
product would help them. You can also offer different levels of product
commitment so that the customer feels like they have a choice based on
their own situation and are not automatically pointed to the most
expensive product or service option.

By appearing neutral, your customer will feel like you are looking out
for their best interests and rather than just your own financial gains.
Appear as if you are giving them an unbiased opinion even when you are
earning commission on the sale. Just include your affiliate link at the
bottom of the review. You can cover your affiliate link using something
called a &quot;mouseover&quot; so they don’t even know you&apos;re getting a
commission.

 Demonstrate Expertise: 
While appearing neutral is beneficial, you must demonstrate your
expertise regarding your product or service. You don’t buy computer
services from a worker at a fast food restaurant so why would your
customers buy from you if they don’t know your level of expertise? They
want to know that you are an authority on the subject and that they are
investing their money with a reliable, intelligent business.

Communicate
the amount of money you have earned in your area of expertise. If you
had to choose between buying an eBook from an online marketer that
earned $10,000 versus $1,000,000, which one would you choose? The
$1,000,000 online marketer of course! So would a customer. This“authority”has demonstrated that they have achieved real financial
success in the area they are writing about.

 Stress Immediacy: 
If you have ever been a car salesman you know the importance of selling
a car to a customer before they step off your lot to“think about it”.
If the customer leaves the car lot then the chances of a sale decrease
dramatically. This applies to your website as well.

It
is important to stress immediacy of the situation so your customer will
act quickly and follow through with a sale. Offer“special”promotions
and discounts that encourage the customer to act quickly or they will
miss out on the opportunity. Following are time sensitive promotions
you can offer to entice customers:
 
 Have a time limit for a promotion. For example, explain in your sales
letter that the customer must act by Friday evening to receive 20% off
the product price. Explain that the promotion is offered only“while supplies last”. This will tempt them to order quickly before you run out. List how many items are left in inventory. Show that there are 100
products left available through your website. Lower the number
throughout the day to prompt customers to act quickly. Display the number of sales. You can show the number of product sales
on your website to promote the success of your product. Customers will
see that other clients are purchasing your product in droves, so it
must be a good product! Home shopping networks utilizing this method
for just about every product they promote. 
 
 Scare Them a Bit: 
I don&apos;t mean scare them literally, just invoke some doubt and question
into their minds. Your customers may not be aware of the implications
of NOT using your product. You need to demonstrate to them that if they
may suffer dire consequences if they don’t purchase your product. This
may sound extreme, but it ingrains a sense of unease in your customer.
Your customer will see that purchasing your product is the only way to
solve their frightening situation.

How
do you create this unease and necessity to buy your product in your
customers’mentality? You can write about frauds and scams that have
occurred regarding your type of niche product or service. Be general
and don’t point to any specific companies. You are acknowledging that
there are less than honest companies out there, but you are not one of
them. You are one of the few that is honest and provides a quality
product.

For example, many
Internet users have heard through the news that get rich quick programs
are a scam. Highlight this to your customer and then point the specific
steps that your company takes to provide an honest, legitimate, quality
product or service.

Also
explain that you spent time researching copious amounts of online
businesses and resources before you picked the products that you are
promoting. Communicate to your customers that you did the legwork for
them. You tried the products and/or spoke with the creators of the
products and maybe their customers as well. Your resources are based on
reading, word of mouth, and personal experience. This will prompt the
customer to feel that they can trust your expertise, research, and
product quality review skills.

 Reverse Psychology: 
Reverse psychology has been used for years, especially when it comes to
children. Remember when you were a child and your parents told you to
clean your room? You probably whined and said“no”. Your parents may
have responded by saying,“Well, I guess you aren’t a“big”kid.”(Remember we all wanted to be considered a“big”kid when were still
little?) Suddenly you found yourself cleaning your room to prove that
you were in fact a“big”kid.

You
can use this same reverse psychology on your customers. You can
actually tell them NOT to purchase your product. A customer is usually
taken aback by this information. Explain that you wouldn’t feel
comfortable selling your product to them until after they have tried
the products of your competition. Make sure to add in that you expect
that after trying the products of your competition that they will be
back to purchase your product because your product is just plain better!

This
type of reverse psychology makes the customer believe that they have
choices and aren’t being forced to buy your product. The customer will
feel that you are looking out for their best interests rather than just
focusing on a sale. This personalization will often lead to a sale. It
is amazing!

 You are in Danger of losing your Savings if you don’t Read this! 
Find out about the frightening facts regarding most“Work from Home”Opportunities and which opportunities are legitimate.

document.write(vStr); July 08 2006
From the desk of James Jackson,

The
internet is filled with“Work from Home”opportunities. Your local
newspaper is plastered with advertisements for home business
opportunities. You turn on your radio to hear another testimonial of
how a person who was in debt became a multimillionaire overnight.

The
notion of working from home seeps into your mindset. You have resisted
starting your own home business for a variety of reasons, but you can
no longer resist the incentive of easy money, especially when your
corporate boss has you working on another mindless report, you think“Hey! I HAVE to find happiness through a work from home business! Where
do I sign up?”

The good
news is that a home based business can be very lucrative. You can set
your own hours which gives you the flexibility to spend time with your
children. Plus, the profits are virtually limitless as long as you put
forth the effort in a well informed manner. Jumping into a home based
business can be the best life choice you have ever made.

Home
based businesses come in a variety of forms from stock investing to
Internet marketing. You could create an online home based business
built around what you are passionate about. This is where you need to
be careful–while you are passionate about your business you need to
be level headed about the way you go about starting your business. Why?
The sad truth is that 99% of the“Work from Home”opportunities you see
on the on the internet, TV, newspaper, and hear on the radio are scams.
Scams with a capital“S”!

We
are ingrained to expect people to be honest and have our best interests
at heart. This couldn’t be farther from the truth for most of these
programs. The fraudulent businesses prey upon our emotions and drain our bank account. I know people that have lost their precious savings because of poor judgment. Don’t let this happen to you! 

When
I started a work from home business I decided that I was going to
investigate several different programs and companies to root out the
legitimate businesses (yes, there definitely are some legitimate
businesses!) from the dishonest businesses. My findings shocked me, but
I did find a solution. The solution has made me thousands of dollars in
profits.

My investigation
included being a“Work from Home”program gumshoe. I made contact with“Work from Home”businesses through their websites. I scoured the
Internet to find as many“Work from Home”businesses as possible. I
pretended that I was interested in becoming part of their program. This
didn’t catch their attention right away so I tried a more extreme
tactic. I explained that I was interested in actually buying their
business entirely. Wow! Did that bring a reaction! Suddenly they were
interested in talking to me and allowed me to review their website
inside and out. (You could never get access like this just by joining
their site.) This allowed me to investigate whether the opportunity was
legitimate or just bogus fluff.

I
was dismayed at the number of programs that had poor business models,
old information, and broken links on their website, a pathetic help
section, and no sign of customer support. If I had paid for this
program I would have been devastated to find this lack of resources and
definitely wouldn’t be able to rake in the big money like they claimed.
Guess what percentage of the businesses I investigated was similar to
this business? 99%! Yes, 99%.

The
owners of these businesses didn’t care that their programs were lacking
because they already had your money. They had taken advantage of you.

Not
all“Work from Home”businesses are a scam. Remember that 1%? Well,
I’ve done the investigative work for you to find the BEST home based
business opportunities. These businesses are not only legitimate, but
WILL be profitable for you. I found these websites by contacting many
happy clients that will attest to the benefits of this program. These
testimonials were not coerced, nor were the happy clients compensated
for their time. They truly believe in the program they have chosen.

The best“Work from Home”businesses I recommend is:
 
 Paid Surveys Etc 
 
You
will be charged a minimal fee to get started in this program, but it is
well worth it. Plus, extensive support is available to get your
business up and running. You need to act as soon as possible because I
have heard from reliable sources that these two businesses are becoming
popular. Other people have discovered the profitability of these
companies and want a piece of the pie. Therefore, you need to act
quickly to secure your spot because the open spaces are limited.

I
hope that I have helped set you on the right course to a profitable
home based business. I did all the detective work for you so you don’t
have to waste time and your hard earned cash dealing with dishonest
programs. Take advantage of the program I have mentioned and start your
Successful Home Business Today!

Wishing you a profitable year!

Signed,

James Jackson
