Aldelo (formerly NextPOS)




Aldelo (formerly NextPOS) For Restaurants Software New Features 
 by Version

 Cut restaurant losses
 Aldelo For Restaurants POS solution helps you prevent staff 
 mistakes and thefts. Our solution is also designed to help you 
 increase operations efficiency while reducing costs.

You will be able to cut costs by using roll paper as guest 
 checks, saving you thousands annually. You will have the ability to 
 strictly enforcing time card activities. You may also experience 
 overall cost savings from significantly reduced mistakes, thefts and 
 much more. The bottom line for you is increased profit potential 
 from reduction in operating expenses.

In addition, Aldelo For Restaurants further helps you identify 
 procurement savings by showing you vendor price history. At one 
 glance, you will see how much you were charged in the past by 
 various vendors when you use our purchase order feature.

Kitchen communication problems will no longer bother your staff. 
 Aldelo For Restaurants is capable of automatically routing kitchen 
 orders up to six departments, saving your servers time and help you 
 prevent kitchen prep mistakes.

When it comes to increasing operations efficiency, Aldelo For 
 Restaurants has a wide variety of features to help you accomplish 
 this goal.

 Simplify daily management
 As a restaurant owner or general manager, have you ever wished that 
 there was a system that could let you perform the end of day 
 procedure as simple as the touch of a button?

Aldelo For Restaurants software solution gives you this simplified 
 daily closing procedure that you may have dream about! And there&apos;s 
 more.

Instead of spending hours trying to match up all of the paper guest 
 checks&apos; numbers, or if with some other POS systems that you need to 
 go through awkward closing procedures, Aldelo For Restaurants will 
 let you generate the daily closing report for any given date with 
 the touch of a button.

Anyone without any computer knowledge will also be able to do this 
 easily. In less than a few second, you will have your closing report 
 for the specified date. It will show you all the detailed sales 
 information, as well as numerous activities that may have occurred 
 in you restaurant that you may want to know about.

Wouldn&apos;t you like to save the tedious steps of going through the 
 day&apos;s tickets? Aldelo For Restaurants will be able to help you do 
 that easily and effortlessly in no time.

These are just some of the features that will help you get more done 
 while spending less time.

 Faster Kitchen&amp;Bar Response
 Faster kitchen or bar response means better customer service, which 
 will in turn generate more sales for the restaurant from satisfied 
 customers.

With a paper based system or inefficient POS solution, faster 
 kitchen or bar response is much harder to accomplish. Just imagine 
 all the foot traffic from the dining room to the kitchen or bar, and 
 the illegible hand written orders - a big cause of kitchen mistakes.

In addition, if the restaurant has two or more kitchen departments, 
 it will be even harder to accomplish faster kitchen response time 
 without smart kitchen routing.

With Aldelo For Restaurants software, your servers will no longer 
 need to rush to the kitchen or bar to submit orders anymore. All 
 ordered items will be correctly routed to the appropriate remote 
 kitchen or bar printers automatically.

In addition, if your restaurant does volume take outs, a separate 
 copy could be sent to a dedicated packager printer. This capability 
 will eliminate the need for any foot traffic to and from the kitchen 
 or bar, as well as eliminating sloppy hand writing.

Aldelo For Restaurants truly increases your restaurant&apos;s kitchen and 
 bar response time.

 Better customer service
 Customers now days are demanding more and more in term of service&amp;quality. With the ever increasing competition, you can&apos;t simply rely 
 on good food and regular service alone anymore.

In order to keep your current customers satisfied, you may need to 
 offer different marketing plans such as frequent diner programs or 
 in house charge account services. By offering your customers more, 
 you will attract and keep customers that are both new or returning.

Knowing about your customers is also a key part to success. The most 
 important asset of a restaurant is your customers. Using Aldelo For 
 Restaurants software&apos;s built-in customer tracking features will help 
 you control and provide better customer service easily.

Aldelo For Restaurants helps you accomplish more customer service 
 out of the box. Our solution helps you understand your customer&apos;s 
 past purchase behavior so that you can structure effective marketing 
 plans.

Aldelo For Restaurants helps you retain guest loyalty by allowing 
 you to offer store credit, gift cards, in house charge accounts, VIP 
 discounts and frequent buyer program. Increasing delivery customer 
 satisfaction by offering faster service is a reality with our visual 
 mapping and automatic customer information recalls.

All of these features and more give you the power and flexibility to 
 better serve your customers. It&apos;s not just the ability to keep the 
 information, but Aldelo For Restaurants also gives you the ability 
 to retrieve the information quickly.

 Greater atmosphere
 A modern POS system will add greatly to the atmosphere of your 
 restaurant environment. Contrary to common beliefs, customers do pay 
 attention to your restaurant&apos;s new fixtures and atmosphere.

In addition, the guest check that you present to your customers will 
 show the purchases and other information clearly without compromise.

Your customers will no longer see your servers&apos; hand written tags or 
 scratch marks. You may also include your restaurant sales 
 promotional messages on your guest checks. Greater restaurant 
 atmosphere makes your valued customers feel at home.

For example, if you have 5 guests and like to be seated by the window, then all the available tables that meet with your criteria in the current group will flash. Enhanced table layout.
