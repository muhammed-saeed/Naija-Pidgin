Microsoft Corp. and Skype Global S.a r.l have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire Skype for $8.5 billion in cash from the investor group led by Silver Lake. The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both Microsoft and Skype.

eBay had acquired Skype in 2005 under Meg Whitman approximately $2.6 billion. It then sold 70% of Skype for $1.9 billion in 2009 to an investor group led by Silver Lake that included Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board in a deal valuing the business at $2.75 billion.

 Inflation at lowest level since 1957 
 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com)—Consumer prices for everything other than food and energy are rising, but at a rate so sluggish, it&apos;s the smallest price increase on record, the government said Wednesday.

The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, increased 1.2% over the past 12 months ending in October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

 Reform law lets stores set minimum amounts for charging 
 A new federal law could force consumers to cough up more cold, hard cash at store registers.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allows retailers and other businesses to require up to a $10 minimum for credit-card purchases.

But the new law doesnt sit well with Somerville consumer advocate Edgar Dworksy, founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

Just because the purchase is small, doesnt mean (consumers) arent interested in using a credit card, Dworsky said. I would guess that most purchases at a dollar store are under $10. Many consumers want to use credit there, or if they go to a fast-food restaurant, and not feel like theyre being forced to use cash or a debit card.

Credit-card networks such as Visa and MasterCard used to prohibit businesses from setting minimums. But the 848-page financial reform law passed in July now prevents them from including such terms in their merchant agreements. It also gives the Federal Reserve Board the power to raise the minimum beyond $10.

 Apple Sues eBay&apos;s Largest Seller eForcity over Alleged Knockoffs 
 Apple sued eBay&apos;s largest seller eForcity and several other online sellers in July for patent and trademark infringement and unfair competition, claiming the merchants sold various iPod, iPhone and iPad accessories that are not licensed or otherwise authorized by the company.

Apple alleged that Eforcity, Accstation, Itrimming, Everydaysource, United Integral, Crazyondigital and Boxwave infringed its numerous patents through their manufacture, use, sale, importation and/or offer for sale of unlicensed accessories, including AV adapters, backup batteries, cables, chargers, cradles, FM transmitters, and speaker systems.

 Can AOL Really Buy Yahoo? 
 
Yahoo Inc.&apos;s inability to snap out of a financial funk may be about to turn the embattled Internet company into a takeover target for the second time in less than three years.

That possibility, floated in a story posted online late Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, lifted Yahoo&apos;s shares by nearly 13 percent in Wednesday&apos;s after-hours trading.

After snubbing a $47.5 billion buyout offer from the much larger Microsoft Corp. in 2008, Yahoo this time may find itself being courted by a smaller rival with its own problems, AOL Inc.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Vigier is now Apples product manager for mobile commerce. Before joining Apple he worked with a company called mFoundry, developing mobile payment services for PayPal and Starbucks, and also worked on a project called the mobile wallet.

 Investors Chide Michael Dell 
 Dells shareholders delivered a sharp rebuke of Michael S. Dell, the companys founder and chief executive, when a fourth of the investors withheld support of Mr. Dell in a recent vote.

In a regulatory filing released Tuesday, Dell disclosed that about 378 million of 1.5 billion votes opposed Mr. Dells continued presence on the companys board. Dell held its annual meeting with shareholders earlier in the month.

Mr. Dell is quite properly an iconic figure at the company, said Joseph A. Grundfest, a Stanford law professor and co-director of the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance. It is extremely rare to have that amount of shareholder disaffection directed toward an executive who is so central to the companys past, present and future.

 India May Soon Resolve BlackBerry Dispute 
 Indian officials and Research In Motion, the maker of popular BlackBerry devices, appear to be making progress toward resolving a battle over the governments ability to monitor encrypted e-mail and instant messages.

Government officials, wireless phone companies and R.I.M. have been hashing out details of how the monitoring would work and are hopeful that they will have a plan in place by an Aug. 31 deadline set by New Delhi, a representative for cellular companies said Tuesday.

India has said it wants to be able to monitor encrypted corporate e-mail and messages sent over BlackBerry Messenger, a service that allows users to chat with one another. Officials here and in other countries like the United Arab Emirates have expressed concern that the services could be used by terrorists to plan and carry out attacks.

 Billionaire Ellison blasts HP CEO&apos;s ouster 
 Billionaire Larry Ellison is blasting Hewlett-Packard&apos;s decision to oust CEO Mark Hurd as cowardly and the worst personnel decision since Apple forced out Steve Jobs 25 years ago.

Ellison, Oracle&apos;s CEO and a friend of Hurd&apos;s, issued a statement Monday saying that the move to get rid of Hurd went against the best interests of HP&apos;s employees, shareholders, customers and partners. Oracle is one of those partners.

HP&apos;s decision to go public with a sexual harassment claim against Hurd, even though a company investigation found no basis for the claim, was an act of“cowardly corporate political correctness”by a divided board of directors, Ellison says.

HP repeated that the board voted unanimously for Hurd&apos;s resignation.

 Google To Launch Deals Site? 
 
Ive been pushing the shopping engines, including Google Shopping, to talk about deals for years. The economy stinks and shopping engines can easily push bargains and savings. And many have done so. Yahoo! Shopping did this really early on. Become, Pronto, PriceGrabber, and the rest followed. But Google is still a holdout in that they dont allow a merchant to submit a Sale Price in addition to a Regular Price, and thus allow a consumer to see a 10% off, 20% off, or 25% off sticker/star.

Deals. You hear about a hot new daily deal site every day. Its hard to keep track. I used DailyCandy back in the dayand today the company launched DailyCandy Stylish alerts for Android (only for NYC). Ive used Woot off and on for yearsand now that its an Amazon company, expect to see Woot leverage Amazons relationship with millions of sellers (and buyers, of course). Twitter is experimenting with @earlybird. Groupon and the hundreds (is it thousands?) of clones around the country and around the world are the darlings of the media and the talk of the town. And for a good reason. Groupon is an incredible business making a boatload of money.

 Amazons Prime Suspect 
 Im a member of Amazon Prime, and I cant help congratulating myself. Though I should know better, I persist in believing that Amazon Prime, a program that for an annual fee gets me free two-day shipping on purchases from Amazon, is something Ive been tapped for like Skull and Bones. Sure, I know that Amazon flogs Amazon Prime on every Web street corner, and if you shop even once at the nations largest online retailer you practically have to fight not to join up, which is to say, to pay the 79 bucks that make you a member. But on most days Im so delighted by the warm welcome the site gives me, the exciting word free it never gets old and Amazon Primes many right-this-way-madams that I let myself believe Im just better and wiser than other Amazon shoppers. With the double-consciousness of the recreational shopper, who knows the clerks are on commission but still craves their solicitousness, I refuse to even entertain the idea Im being suckered.

So it wasnt easy to suppress despair the other night when someone casually mentioned that there might be something . . . a little . . . chumpy about Amazon Prime. He wasnt even talking about the auto-renewal, though its true Amazon doesnt exactly grab you by the lapels to warn you that your card has been charged again, or about Amazons new program to draw students in by waiving the Prime membership fee for the first year. He hinted at something more sinister.

 Apple Offers Free Cases to Address iPhone Issue 
 
Steven P. Jobs, chief executive of Apple, acknowledged Friday that the companys iPhone 4 had some problems with its antenna but said the same problems affected all smartphones and had been widely exaggerated by the media.

This has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible, Mr. Jobs said at a news conference at the companys headquarters here.

Mr. Jobs said that to put the problems behind it, Apple would give free bumpers cases that wrap around the rim of the phone to all iPhone 4 buyers who want them. And he said those who had already bought the cases would get a full refund. The price of the bumpers from Apple is $29.

Customers still unhappy can return the phones for a full refund. The cases will remain free until Sept. 30.

 Google Buys Metaweb to Improve Search Results 
 There are some Web searches that Google doesnt handle so well like finding a famous persons birthday, or searching for a word that means many different things. Search for Boston, for example, and all the top links are about the city in Massachusetts. But Boston is also the name of a band and 26 other cities.

Google said Friday that in an effort to improve these tricky types of search queries, it was buying Metaweb, a San Francisco start-up that says it makes Web sites smarter.

Metaweb, as the company explains in this video, helps Web sites link information based on connections between people, places and things, instead of words. Web sites can tap into and use Metawebs technology. For instance, a movie review site could pull in a trailer video, a list of showtimes and a movie poster image.

 Running an Ecommerce Business from the Road 
 When they&apos;re traveling, most people like to check out the nightlife, the shopping, or the tourist attractions. But if you&apos;re like me, when you are traveling somewhere, you have an uncontrollable urge to check out the local vintage and resale shops. You may even have wondered what it would be like to just pack up all your belongings and hit the road permanently - with plenty of opportunities to explore the highways and byways of the country and dig up some rare collectibles as well.

That&apos;s just what Tina Sutherland did a little more than six years ago. She and her husband Dennis have no permanent address. They travel the country in their RV, and while they do, she runs an online sewing patterns store called What-I-Found from it.

 Credit card processing bills are a jumble. Here&apos;s how to read yours. 
 

No one likes a bill, especially one filled with cryptic codes and indecipherable jargon. That&apos;s a pretty good description of a statement from a credit card processor. Such firms authorize credit and move funds through the banking system so that you get paid. For these services, you pay the processor a fee, known as the discount rate. Many processors tout low discount rates to lure new customers. Problem is, your bill can be so complicated that it&apos;s nearly impossible to figure out if you&apos;re paying that low rate--or a lot more, thanks to a host of surcharges and fees. We recently studied a dozen statements. While bills differ from processor to processor, here are some common fees you might see on yours.

 Amazon buys deal-a-day website Woot 
 
Amazon.com Inc. has purchased deal-a-day website Woot.com.

In a joke-tinged message on the company blog, Woot CEO Matt Rutledge said the deal won&apos;t change how the site is run _“with a wall of ideas and a dartboard.”

“For Woot, our vision remains the same: somehow earning a living on snarky commentary and junk,”Rutledge wrote.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Amazon spokesman Craig Berman said the Seattle-based online retailer expects to finalize the deal by the end of September.

 Jews in Arab east Jerusalem defy Obama peace push 
 When Devorah Adler&apos;s children go to school, they pass underneath the gun-toting security officer who stands on their roof 24-hours a day, walk down a path dotted by surveillance cameras and get in a van manned by another armed guard.

Adler is one of 2,000 Jews who reside in predominantly Arab neighborhoods in the heart of east Jerusalem, part of a movement that aims to ensure Israel&apos;s hold on the sector, which Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state.

Revved up by the Obama administration&apos;s latest attempts to limit Jewish encroachment in disputed areas of the holy city, they are working furiously to cement and expand their presence.

 Symantec Is Said to Agree to Buy VeriSign Unit 
 is near a deal to buy VeriSigns authentication services unit for $1.3 billion, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.

An agreement over the business, which provides security technology for online payments, could be reached this week, these people said, cautioning that talks were continuing and might fall apart.

The deal, if consummated, would be the latest step by VeriSign as the company sells off divisions to focus on its core business: maintaining tens of millions of Internet domain names. It would also bolster Symantecs standing as the worlds biggest provider of technology security.

 Dell Posts a 52% Increase in Profit, but Still Awaits a Wave of Corporate PC Buying 
 presented Wall Street with tidy first-quarter results on Thursday, but the numbers lacked some of the luster presented by other technology bellwethers in recent weeks.

Like the others, Dell has depended on improving demand for computing equipment to climb out of the recession. Its first-quarter results showed rising sales across its major product lines and a much higher profit than at the same time last year.

Dell, however, continues to rely on large companies to buy new PCs, more than do other PC makers, and large companies still seem content with their old machines.

Until corporate spending really comes back, Dell will remain in the penalty box, said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman&amp;Renshaw.

 Senate Passes Broader Rules for Overseeing Wall Street 
 The Senate on Thursday approved a far-reaching financial regulatory bill, putting Congress on the brink of approving a broad expansion of government oversight of the increasingly complex banking system and financial markets.

The legislation is intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, but also reshapes the role of numerous federal agencies and vastly empowers the Federal Reserve in an attempt to predict and contain future debacles.

The vote was 59 to 39, with four Republicans joining the Democratic majority in favor of the bill. Two Democrats opposed the measure, saying it was still not tough enough.
