Restaurant cash registers are required in all business establishments to help in the calculating and recording of all sales transactions. While the first few cash registers were mechanical and worked without any printers, the modern versions of cash registers are electronic ones that come with bar code scanners, printers and other accessories used for various tasks in the establishment.

 

There are many companies manufacturing all types of cash registers like restaurant cash registers, food service cash register, coffee shop cash register and bar cash register. Similarly, there are various brands of cash registers in the market today like Casio cash register, sharp cash register, royal cash registers, Tec cash register and Samsung cash register.

Different types of software

The main difference between the various types of cash registers is the software that is used in the cash register. It is based on the programming of the software that the cash register helps in the recording of sales and transactions in the business establishment.

In grocery stores, the cash register not only helps in recording sales, but also in monitoring the inventory of the store, producing detailed sales reports about user-defined data and printed receipts for customers.

In case of restaurant cash registers, the software produces the menu of the restaurant on the computer screen. The preferred option for restaurant cash registers are touch screen registers.

Increased efficiency

All that the waiter has to do is to enter the order placed by the customer into the machine by pressing the screen. With this, the kitchen immediately receives the order. This makes it easy for the kitchen staff to quickly get started on cooking the meals placed by the customers.

There are some restaurants that have interfaces connected to restaurant cash registers on the individual tables of the restaurants. All the customer has to do is to make their choice on their screen, and the order is passed on to the kitchen. This makes service much faster as customers need not wait for waiters to take their orders, but only to bring their orders to them once they are ready.
