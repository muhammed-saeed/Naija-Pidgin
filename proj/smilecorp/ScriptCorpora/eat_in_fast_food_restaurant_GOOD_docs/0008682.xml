 Calorie Counter by FatSecret for android 

 Calorie Counter offers you a fully functional Food Diary, Exercise Diary, Diet Calendar, and Weight Tracker. With the Food Diary , you can document the foods you have eaten throughout the day, broken up into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks/other. In order to add a food item, click the green plus button under the specific category. There, you can choose to search for a food in multiple ways: 
 Search by name 
 A drop-down menu of matching items as you type makes this option very quick 
 Scan a barcode 
 This is a great feature if you have the food package in front of you, and its quite accurate 
 Perform a Quick Pick 
 Here you can find foods by category, restaurant (including fast food), popular brands, and supermarket brands 
 Most Eaten Recently Eaten Saved Meals 
 The previous three options come from entries you have already made to speed up the process, since we seem to eat the same foods again and again
