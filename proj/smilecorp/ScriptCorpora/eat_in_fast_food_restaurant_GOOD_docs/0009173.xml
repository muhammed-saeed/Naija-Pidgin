 A Clothes Encounter In The Business World 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Follow these professional business attire tips for both men and women because we are judged by the way we dress.

Do you ever wonder where all the dress rules have gone? Depending on when and where you are on any given business day, the words“distant past”might come to mind. It’s difficult to decide if people don’t know what to wear to work or if they have lost sight of the relevance of appearance to professional success.

The Queen of England is reported to have told Prince Charles,“Dress gives one the outward sign from which people can judge the inward state of mind. One they can see, the other they cannot.”Clearly, she was saying what many people are reluctant to accept; that people judge us by the way we dress. In all situations, business and social, our outward appearance sends a message.

Try going to a busy restaurant at lunchtime. Look around you at what people are wearing and see if you don’t make judgments about who they are, their line of business, their personalities and their competencies. Think about how you feel when you are dressed in your usual business attire as opposed to casual dress. Your choice of business apparel speaks to your professional behavior and credibility. It is important to understand how to dress for business if you wish to promote yourself and your organization in a positive manner,

How you dress depends on four factors: the industry in which you work, the job you have within that industry, the geographic area in which you live; and most importantly, what your client expects to see.

Professional Dress for Men

In men’s clothing, fashion does not change significantly from season to season but business attire is about being professional and not about being fashionable. It’s about presenting yourself in a way that makes your clients feel comfortable and confident with you. Dressing for success is still the rule. The professional businessman should keep in mind these few points when deciding what to wear to work.

Choose a conservative suit in navy, black or gray either pinstripe or solid. The quality of the material speaks as loudly as the color and can make the difference between sleaze and suave.

A solid white or blue dress shirt with long sleeves offers the most polished look. The more pattern and color you add, the more the focus is on your clothing, rather than your professionalism.

Ties should be made of silk or a silk-like fabric. Avoid the cartoon characters and go for simple and subtle if you want to enhance your credibility.

Socks should be calf-length or above. Make sure they match not only what you are wearing, but also each other. A quick glance in good light before heading out the door can save embarrassment later in the day. Check for holes as well if you’ll be going through airport security and removing your shoes.

Shoes should without question be conservative, clean and well polished. Lace-up shoes are the choice over slip-ons or flip flops. Don’t think for a minute that people don’t notice shoes. Many people will look at your feet before your face.

Belts need to match or closely coordinate with your shoes. Once again, quality counts.

Keep jewelry to a minimum. In a time when men sport gold necklaces, bracelets and earrings, the business professional should limit himself to a conservative watch, a wedding band and maybe his college ring.

Personal hygiene is part of the success equation. Freshly scrubbed wins out over heavily fragranced any day of the week. Save the after-shave for after hours, but never the shave itself.

The finishing touch for the business man is his choice of accessories: briefcase, portfolio and pen. When it comes to sealing the deal, a top of the line suit, a silk tie and a good pair of leather shoes can lose their affect when you pull out the ball point pen you picked up in the hotel meeting room the day before.

Professional Dress for Women

When women entered the workplace in the 1970′s and 1980′s in greater numbers than ever before and began to move into positions which had traditionally been held by men, many of them believed that they needed to imitate male business attire. The result was women showing up at the office in skirted suits or coordinated skirts and jackets with tailored blouses finished off with an accessory item that looked very much like a man’s tie. Happily those days are gone. While the business woman may now wear trousers to work, she does it out of a desire to appear professional and at the same time enjoy the flexibility and comfort that pants offer over skirts. Her goal is no longer to mirror her male colleagues.

The same overall rules apply to women’s work attire as apply to men’s. Business clothing is not a reflection of the latest fashion trend. A woman should be noticed for who she is and her professional skills rather than for what she wears. Her business wear should be appropriate for her industry and her position or title within the industry.

Start with a skirted suit or pants suit for the most conservative look. A skirted suit is the most professional. With a few exceptions, dresses do not offer the same credibility unless they are accompanied by matching jackets.

Skirts should be knee-length or slightly above or below. Avoid extremes. A skirt more than two inches above the knee raises eyebrows and questions.

Pants should break at the top of the foot or shoe. While Capri pants and their fashion cousins that come in assorted lengths from mid-calf to ankle are the latest trend, they are out of place in the conservative business environment.

Blouses and sweaters provide color and variety to woman’s clothing, but they should be appealing rather than revealing. Inappropriate necklines and waistlines can give the wrong impression.

Women need to wear hose in the business world. Neutral or flesh-tone stockings are the best choices. Never wear dark hose with light-colored clothing or shoes. Keep an extra pair of stockings in your desk drawer unless the hosiery store is next door or just down the street from the office.

Faces, not feet, should be the focal point in business so chose conservative shoes. A low heel is more professional than flats or high heels. In spite of current fashion and the sandal rage, open-toed or backless shoes are not office attire. Not only are sandals a safety hazard, they suggest a certain official agenda.

When it comes to accessories and jewelry, less is once again more. Keep it simple: one ring per hand, one earring per ear. Accessories should reflect your personality, not diminish your credibility.

Business attire is different from weekend and evening wear. Investing in a good business wardrobe is an investment in your professional future. For those who think it’s not what you wear but who you are that creates success, give that some more thought. Business skills and experience count, but so does personal appearance and that all-important first impression.

 A Short History of Gloves 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Glove making has been intertwined with human culture since the caveman. This short history highlights some interesting facts about gloves and their uses.

An old and reclusive art, glove making has been intertwined with human culture since the days of the caveman. The first gloves resembled crude mittens. As the years passed, glove making became more of a refined art. Articulated fingers were stitched in to provide more dexterity and ease of movement. While glove makers’guilds once dominated in a society obsessed with a covered hand, today very few remain. Fewer still are the patterns available for hand-made gloves. Machine sewn and hand-finished gloves are mostly what you’ll find in the market.

Gloves are seen in ancient writings, such as Homer’s The Odyssey, in which Laertes is said to wear gloves in his garden so as to avoid the brambles. There is some debate over the translation of this text. In The History of Herodotus, written in 440 BC, Herodotus describes how Leotychides was given a bribe in the form of a gauntlet overflowing with silver, which later incriminated him.

As years passed, the complexity and versatility of gloves grew. Plated gauntlets are dated back as far as the early 14th century. Before that, mail gloves were worn. Some knights were cited as wearing mail gloves under their plated gauntlets for added strength.

Now, if we look to the fashion world, we see a marvelous array of styles. Cloth and leather gauntlets displayed intricate embroideries. Ladies in the 19th century adored opera gloves. One peculiarity is that they tried to fit their hands into gloves a size too small! This forced one’s hand to rest in a half cupped position–perfect for greeting, but not for kissing. If you have ever attempted to don a glove you are too big for, you realize what a task these women undertook! Buttonhook and powdered alum provided some lubrication, but still, before an opera, determined women would sit for hours, coaxing their hands down into tight gloves.

Few tomes remain that give us real insight of early gloves. One of the more revered in existence today is Le Gant. The book, while entirely in French, reveals many patterns and divulges a brief development and history of the glove. Also included are passages telling us of the period’s social relevance and sexual significance pertaining to the glove.

Insulation from the heat or cold. Protection from scratches and cuts. The instigation of duels. Bold or minute fashion statements. Gloves have worn many hats, so to speak, throughout history. They continue to be a wholly integral part of many jobs today. Conversely, there has been a sharp decline in the use of gloves as fashion accessories over the past several decades. Fewer and fewer girls attend their proms with gloves. Fashion is a fickle thing, and only time will tell the future of the glove.

Glove enthusiast, Taylor Hartley, conducts and posts research regarding all types of gloves. For more information regarding industrial and personal use gloves, visit http://www.unitedglove.com.

 Accessorize Your Wedding Attire with a Stunning Bridal Handbag 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Bridal handbags can add a touch of elegance to your wedding attire. Here are some tips to choose the bridal handbag that’s right for you…

If there’s one day when you want to look stunning, it’s your wedding day. You also want to be practical on this busy day. You probably would like to carry a few needful things along so you’ll have them on-hand as you prepare for the reception or as you drive away into the sunset with your beloved. Bridal handbags are both stunning and practical for this very purpose.

Bridal handbags, or wedding purses, come in all shapes and sizes with many dashing designs, and with just enough room to carry those small personal items such as touch-up powder, eye liner, lipstick, deodorant, a comb or brush, keys, handkerchiefs, or maybe even a little spare change! After the wedding, there are always photos, reception food and drink, and a time of fellowship with family and friends. A bridal handbag allows you to carry a few things along to touch up your hair and makeup as you make the transition from the wedding to the reception.

Types of Bridal Handbags

Bridal handbags are usually very small and easy to carry. They may be decorated with sequins, beads, crystals, lace, ribbons, miniature tassels, or precious stones. Wedding handbags are usually made of materials such as satin, silk, nylon, or polyester.

There are three basic styles of handbags for brides: clutch, fancy, and structured. Clutch bridal purses are typically made of silk or satin, have an inner lining, and do not have straps or handles. Fancy handbags are usually made with elegant designs embellished with precious stones, crystals, or beads. They also come with decorated handles made of metal or cloth with optional shoulder straps. Structured wedding handbags have a stable bottom and are usually made of satin, silk, nylon, or polyester. They also usually have handles and clasps made of metal.

Accentuate Your Wedding Dress

Bridal handbags are a great accessory for your wedding attire. Choose a bridal purse that matches or complements your dress, jewelry, tiara, and wedding shoes. The handbag should be made of the same or similar material as your dress and have similar patterns and designs. If your dress has lace and white pearls, find a wedding purse decorated with lace and white pearls (or beads that resemble pearls).

Choose a bridal handbag that fits your style and your figure. The handbag should be easy to handle and not too large. You don’t want to attract too much attention to your wedding purse. It shouldn’t stand out, but it should blend with your other attire. It should add a touch of elegance without dominating the reception photos.

Wedding Handbags as Bridesmaid Gifts

Wedding handbags can also be ordered to match the dresses of bridesmaids and given as gifts from the bride. Choose handbags that your bridesmaids can use for other occasions, not only at the wedding. Every woman and girl loves a new handbag, so these make excellent gifts!

If you’re not sure where to shop for bridal handbags, you can find a variety of styles online along with other wedding accessories such as tiaras, ring cushions, jewelry, and more. Use these tips to find a lovely bridal handbag for your special day!

 Answers to Common Questions About Prom Dresses 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Here are answers to common questions that relate to prom dresses, homecoming dresses, and quinceanera dresses.

There are few occasions that are as nerve-wracking as prom night. This is because, aside from the anxiety provoking“what ifs”the night of the prom, you have to avoid all of the potential pitfalls leading up to the prom. Whether you’re going with the date of your dreams or you’re planning to attend the prom with a group of girlfriends, there’s no getting around the issue of prom dresses. Finding the right eveningwear such a formal occasion can seem like an impossible challenge. Here, then, are answers to common questions that relate to prom dresses, homecoming dresses, and quinceanera dresses.

1. I’m short and want to look taller for my prom. What should I do?

There are three elements that can help you appear taller on your special night: the right heels, the right prom dress, and the right hairstyle. First, plan on wearing high heels. Whether you add one inch or three with high heels, it’s important that you look for prom dresses that will accommodate the heels. You might want to go with a cocktail length dress, but a floor length dress will add length to your body–and an illusion of height. Look for floor length prom dresses that have side slits for better maneuverability. Finally, take care in selecting your hairstyle. Go with an updo to add height–even if you need to add extensions or a hairpiece.

2. I’m a senior in high school, but I look like an eighth grader. How do I look older for prom?

When it comes to maturity, keep two things in mind: bearing and appearance. Body language is important, in that how you move your body, how you tilt your head, the timber of your voice, and the way you walk all speak volumes about your perceived age. While you definitely don’t want to pretend you’re someone you’re not, this might be a good opportunity to practice skills that will help you evolve into the person you want to be. Practice walking in your prom shoes, watch your facial expressions in the mirror, record your voice to hear how it sounds, and so forth. Make any adjustments (and practice) so that your mannerisms reflect what you feel inside.

When you look for prom dresses, look for those that are more formal. Formal clothing makes women appear older, as do colors that are dark and rich. Depending on your coloring, you might want to go with jewel tones, black, or chocolate brown.

3. How do I know how to have my hair styled for prom?

How you fashion your hair greatly depends upon the style of your prom dress. If your dress has a high collar or a busy neckline, an updo is the only way to go. On the other hand, if your prom dress is sleeveless, strapless, or has spaghetti straps, you can wear your hair long or short, full or sleek. The one caveat is to make sure your hair doesn’t cover up an important feature of your prom dress. That gorgeous keyhole back, for example, will be invisible if you have hair down to your waist!

 Aprons: The Necessary Accessory! 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
For employees who cook in a restaurant kitchen or work in the dining room waiting tables, wearing an apron is often a uniform requirement. While they serve the purpose of preventing grease or coffee spills from soiling work uniform pants and shirts, aprons are also a handy attachment to tote customer needs.

For employees who cook in a restaurant kitchen or work in the dining room waiting tables, wearing an apron is often a uniform requirement. While they serve the purpose of preventing grease or coffee spills from soiling work uniform pants and shirts, aprons are also a handy attachment to tote customer needs.

For a waiter or waitress, who usually wear just a half apron that wraps around their waists, it’s important that the frock contain several accessible pocket compartments in which to carry necessities for the job. Not only is this convenient for the time-pressed server, but it will also impress a dine-in customer when the item needed is right at the finger tips of their attendant.

Items which should be carried by a waiter in their apron should include an ordering tablet, two or three pens, straws and matches. If feasible, extra condiments should also be allowed for as part of the supply load, like catsup bottles or packets and creamer and butter samplers. But be sure to protect liquid products from creating a mess within the apron–this happens to even the best of servers! Sometimes, in the rush to fill a demanding customer’s coffee cup, leaning up against the counter or dining table causes a juicy explosion. It is best to keep those types of additives in a side pocket where they are safer.

Yet another issue that accompanies server aprons is the attached adjustable ties that are supposed to be secured on the back side of the waiter. As people come in all shapes and sizes, fastening these strings can be a side-show all in itself. Larger waisted people may have a difficult time tying a bow where the two ends meet because there simply is not enough material. Thinner servers may have to wrap the ties around two or three times before accomplishing a bow to secure the apron. A possible solution would be for management to purchase aprons which will accommodate any shape or size or server to allow for a more uniformed appearance of their staff.

Color choices for restaurant cook aprons usually aren’t that significant. The full cover aprons of the dishwashers, fry cooks and salad makers are rarely seen by the dining public. That is probably a good thing; chances are those hard-working employees in the back are wearing everything from sauces to sautés! Choosing a shade for the waitresses, waiters, hostesses and bus boy’s aprons is a bit more unrestricted and allows for a creative presentation which compliments the décor of the restaurant dining room or color scheme of the table cloths and furniture.

Lastly, when choosing aprons for restaurant employees, select material that can easily be washed and sanitized and does not require too much effort for stain removal. Although employees are hard-working and dependable, they also have lives outside of the restaurant that may restrict time for uniform upkeep. If possible, provide at least two aprons to each server or cook.

 Are dress codes in workplace important?

It?s a very interesting question. If you sit to discuss about dress codes you might end up in a debate.

Are dress codes important?

It?s a very interesting question. If you sit to discuss about dress codes you might end up in a debate. Creating a dress code for a workplace can be a tricky thing. Fashion is the word of the day and in such an atmosphere dress codes can certainly be a helping hand.

Why are dress codes implemented?

It?s very important to maintain dress codes in an office. Young boys and girls often dress shabbily without bothering what the world has to say. A compulsory dress code can keep them under control and maintain a decent image in public.

If no dress codes are maintained in a workplace then anyone will wear anything of his/her choice. This will distract other employees and have a severe impact on their performance. If a colleague proves to be a distraction the other employees will have a hard time concentrating on their work. Dress codes have to be reasonable depending on the type of work.

Dress Codes for employees

It?s very important that employees sign in neat for work. They might opt for casual or formal business attire, but this is something that will vary greatly from setting to setting.

Some things that are completely against dress codes are:
? Clothing which has an abusive and foul language
? Tank tops, muscle shirts or halter tops
? Wearing torn jeans and tops
? Hats or caps
? Wearing sweaty pants or sweat suits

What things should employers keep in mind at the time of deciding a dress code?

Dress codes have to be reasonable depending on the type of work. At the time of developing a dress ode the employer should ensure that they are:
? Job related
? Not treating one sex less favorably than the other
? Not treating one race less favorably than the other

It?s very important that the employer communicates these dress codes to the employees, for them to follow.

Are confident plain dressers really conceited? Yes. Persons that are conceited dress less as they feel that dressing up is not a flattery to them and their assertive personality can over come the stylish fashion they choose.

Are overly adorn friends or co workers having more opportunities in the work field? No overly adorn friends will dress up anywhere they go as they really do not have a place to wear the stylish fashions they choose. When you occasionally see a friend or coworker in the store , they might be just wearing it for a statement that they have really no place to go.

“I never have an outfit to fit the occasion or a thing to wear”persons are they really discontent? Yes and how many of us have said that in a life time we cannot go because we have nothing to wear. Go in the closet and look at the latest fashions and clothing we have, however, still our satisfaction for the style we want is not hanging in the closet.

Do bold statement people brad about the price of their flattering clothes, right? No. Persons that need a boost in confidence will not allow to brag about the bargains, but look for the social fashions status for exaggerated importance on the prices and the stylish fashion statement.

Are persons who over dress or bundle up usually miserable? Yes. Shivering as if you are cold frequently, no matter what the temperature conditions are. Over dressers are persons that will seeking attention for closeness. A person that dresses and wraps up like you would wrap a baby is usually lonely and seeking out attention.

As children dress different and have a different fashions statement, when they get older will the stylish fashion statement stay with them? No. Teen fashions are a variety of spontaneous expression. Teen years will bring out variety, activity and new phases. However in the later years the fashions will bring standard and authority.

Are simple quantity or short dressers rebellious? Yes. Skimpy dressers are the exact opposite of over dressers. This classes of people will wear little to nothing to help with the over protection they feel with in themselves. The less they wear the easier to get out of the clothing when clearly feeling over protected.

Persons who are tidy clothes dressers, are they superior in the trendy fashion statement ? No. This could be an impression they make with dressing to have a deeper impression. Tidy clothes dressers will straighten ties, swipe lint off your jacket to draw attention to themselves.

Are you a casual dresser? If you have agreed yes to this question you are comfortable with anything you wear. Your shopping for trendy fashion clothing will not make a bold statement Your casual dressing will tell others you are comfortable with your styles and love the casual fashion. A casual dresser will be comfortable in any given situation and have kind hearts.

Now that you have looked over the different situations for fashion buying and wearing, where do you fit in here.

Are you a bold person, casual or do you lack courage and determination to get out of the old and into a new fashion

Designer Natasha Ulyanov?s fashion collection will be presented on Sunday, March 26, 2006 at the Champagne Fashion Brunch to be held at La Prima Donna restaurant, 163 West 47th Street, in New York City?s famous theater district. The fashion show will showcase The timeless elegance of Natasha Ulyanov?s fashion designs springs from her juxtaposition of European heritage and American confidence.

Designer Natasha Ulyanov?s fashion collection will be presented on Sunday, March 26, 2006 at the Champagne Fashion Brunch to be held at La Prima Donna restaurant, 163 West 47th Street, in New York City?s famous theater district. Doors open at 12:30 p.m. and the show starts at 1:00 p.m.

The timeless elegance of Natasha Ulyanov?s fashion designs springs from her juxtaposition of European heritage and American confidence. Born in London and raised in Moscow and New York, Natasha has a cosmopolitan perspective on the philosophies of various cultures on beauty and sophistication. Natasha took her cue for fashion design from her experience in visual arts and oil painting, having studied at the Greenwich Academy and having her work published in Art World magazine. Taking art to the next level of turning it into a living expression, Natasha immersed herself into the world of fashion design, graduating from New York?s acclaimed Parsons School of Design and later working with designers Alice Roi, Carolina Herrera, Badgley Mischka, J Mendel and Valentino. Motivated to launch her own line, her first signature collection was inspired by the ever-stylish Audrey Hepburn and was shown at New York?s Guggenheim Museum as part of the most-visited exhibit in the history of the museum entitled ?Russia?.

Natasha Ulyanov continues working to become an influential force in the fashion industry, giving those who wear her designs a new form of expression. Her ageless sophistication and attention to detail and shape bring out the wearer?s inner beauty.

?With the participation of Ms. Ulyanov in the upcoming Champagne Fashion Brunch it all comes together in one place,? says producer Andres Aquino, ?Flavor, taste, ambiance, culture and couture. You have delicious Tuscan cuisine, fine champagne, fashion from a Russian designer and a Dominican designer, jewelry from South African and Austrian designers, beautiful models, exquisite makeup and hair styling and an audience from three continents as well as press and stylish music. This is a unique forum where designers connect directly with high-end consumers in an elegant relaxed atmosphere in the Times Square area right in heart of New York City.?

With the upcoming web casting of the fashion shows and launch of the company?s own magazine as well as ongoing advertising in the New York Times, Playbill and many other publications, there are many opportunities available to sponsors and advertisers looking to reach an affluent fashion-conscious audience at both the national and international levels. Tickets to the shows are becoming hot commodities as appreciation gifts and corporate incentives for Fortune 500 corporations as well as special family and social gatherings. Other guests include celebrities out for an unusual afternoon or evening activity and buyers looking for unique fashions for their boutiques. Attendees come from around the USA, the Far East, Europe, Canada and South America. People are buying tickets up to six months in advance. Tickets are available through the company website–www.usafashionshows.com–as well as through various ticket outlets worldwide.

Participating designers present some of the best wearable couture and exquisite accessories. Recent shows have featured collections by designers from a host of countries including Austria, South Africa, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Russia, Israel, Bulgaria, England, India, and the USA. Some already have their lines carried in exclusive stores like Bergdorf Goodman and chic boutiques on Madison Avenue as well as in other fashion capitals.

Portions of Champagne Fashion Brunch proceeds support children?s charity providing food, clean water, medical care and other assistance in poverty stricken countries around the world.

Producer Andres Aquino is CEO of USA International Fashion Shows and founder of Fashion Syndicate Press. He also produces Couture Fashion Week, Bridal Fashion Week and the Martini Fashion Dinner series.

 Baby Clothes Overstock and Clearance Items 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Retail clothing storeowners inevitably face the same situation year after year ? a surplus of last season?s styles in some form or another. This is good news for the consumer, as prices on these items are typically slashed well below retail in order to make room for new products. But what to do with the clearance items that remain on the shelves well into the next season? Or what if there simply isn?t enough room to hang on to these items any longer once new products arrive? Storeowners who find themselves facing these questions may want to consider donating overstock and/or clearance items to a worthy charitable organization.

In many cases, making a sizeable donation will not only benefit the many people touched by the organization receiving your donation, it may make a positive impact on your bottom line by allowing your business a tax write-off at the end of the year. If you are considering making a sizeable donation, you may first want to contact your tax advisor to discuss how the donation would impact your tax scenario.

It is advisable to spend some time researching potential organizations prior to donating. There are seemingly countless organizations out there that are willing to take donations of clothing and accessory items. When choosing an organization, make sure first and foremost that the organization is not-for-profit, as this ensures the potential tax-benefit of donating. It may be easier to locate large national organizations, but it is worthwhile to research smaller local organizations as well. These local organizations often do not receive the level of exposure necessary to meet theirs demands at the same level as larger organizations. As is the case in so many situations, the internet is generally the best source of information for researching charitable organizations. In addition, consult your local phone book, and ask around. Chances are you already know somebody who has some sort of connection to a local charity ? use those connections!

Once you have selected a non-profit organization to receive your donation, it is important to obtain a single point-of-contact within the organization. This person can organize the receipt of your donation, which in many cases can be arranged to take place at your business or warehouse. It is a good idea to provide an itemized list of the donation, including wholesale value, to your point-of-contact at the time of the donation. This list will not only help to document inventory in your records, it will also be a helpful tool for the charity to reference while incorporating the donation items into their existing product supply. In turn, ask that they provide you with a ?letter of receipt?, acknowledging and referencing the value of the donation. This letter will provide documentation that will be needed to validate the tax write-off. Be sure to discuss the significance of this letter with your point-of-contact prior to making the donation, and follow-up soon as the donation is made to be sure the letter is generated in a timely manner.

 Baby Clothing Get the best wear for your little one 
 
Posted In Clothing | No comments
 
Do you want to shop some clothes for your baby? Mothers do not have to worry for Baby clothes any more. Dressing newborn infants is so much fun. Today there are number of online outlets that provide different range of fun Baby clothing for your newly born. All you have to do is sit and select the one, which best suits your child.

Your baby will need number of baby clothing and linen items. Hence it is very important that you prepare yourself in advance for everything. Remember that new born grow very fast. Hence the clothes you will buy for them will quite likely have a very short life. So always buy two to five months older clothing. Here are some tips which will help you to make right choices for your baby.

Things to keep in mind while buying
Always buy enough clothes for you?re newly born to cover the three clothing changes in a day. Always opt for soft material, which are comfortable to wear and remove. Buy durable material, which is washable and long-lived. Buy baby clothes, which are durable else just one wash, would make them useless to wear. Always go for elastic waistbands and trousers. They are more comfortable for toddlers and easily adjustable. Try buying loose clothes they give plenty of room for a child to move his legs, such as leggings and sweats. Buy shapeless heels socks as they grow with your child. Avoid buying patterned socks, as the loose yarn from inside can catch in your baby’s toes.

What Baby Clothes to purchase?
Considering the fact that babies grow very fast, you will need to buy:

? Buy around 4-6 undershirts or‘onesies’
? Buy around 3-8 nightgowns.
? Buy 1-2 baby sweaters especially for the winter season.
? Always keep a stock of Baby diapers ready
? Buy 1-2 sets of Baby towels. Since the skin of the baby is soft, always buy soft baby towels.
? Buy couple of pairs of baby socks
? Buy 2-3 blankets to protect them from cold.

Baby Clothes to Avoid
Avoid buying Mobile Baby Walkers: They promise many things but are useless at the end of the day. They can be dangerous for your child and also do not help the child to walk.

Avoid Buying Infant feeders: Avoid feeding Infant feeders for a newly born child. Mother’s milk is the best milk at this stage. Do not use solid foods until your baby is able to eat from a spoon. You can also consult your doctor for any information about the same.

Avoid using Swings hanged to doorframes: Avoid using swings, as they might be dangerous for your child.

 The High Cost of Dressing by Outfit 
 
Posted In Fashion | No comments
 
“My Nana’s coming for a visit this week,”I overheard one little girl tell her friend on a
playground recently.“I got a special outfit to wear when we pick her up at the airport.”

The sentence made me smile and shake my head. Ah, yes.  I remember those days.

Special outfits:

Special outfits for special occasions like dates, parties, or speeches.  Or weddings.  Or funerals.
Or graduations.  Heck, we even used to get special outfits for school or holiday pictures.  In fact,
we rarely went shopping for clothes; we went shopping for special outfits.

Then when the event was over, the outfit usually just hung in the closet as a reminder of what
we’d worn when.  New function?  New outfit! Heaven forbid we should be seen in the same thing
twice.

Sound familiar?

It’s an expensive habit that can add up quickly, particularly if you’ve never shopped any other
way.  If you tend to shop by outfit, then what I’m about to reveal may hit you like the
proverbial“ton of bricks.”

Are you ready?

It’s cheaper to plan and buy a wardrobe than to fill your closet with special outfits.

Let me put it to you another way:  it’s cheaper to plan a week of menus and go buy groceries than
it is to eat out every night.

Now the second one seems obvious.  If you take your family to a restaurant or through a drive
thru every night for dinner, you could easily spend several hundred dollars in a week.  The
entrees, the beverages, the tips–it all adds up pretty quickly.  If you’ve ever eaten out every
meal while on vacation, you know this is true. And when you consider that a lot of families do
this ALL THE TIME, it’s no wonder everyone’s squawking about the high cost of food.

So let’s apply that same analogy to your closet. Let’s say that instead of planning and buying
what you need at the beginning of a season, that you buy a new outfit as needed every time
something comes up.  Buying outfit by outfit may seem cheaper than buying a bunch of clothes at
once, but if you consider that when you buy a new outfit, you often buy new shoes, hosiery, and
other accessories to go with it, you can easily see how costs add up.  That $40“great”deal can
suddenly become $200 worth of shoes and jewelry that doesn’t go with anything else you own.

So what’s a better strategy?

Well, first, to GET a strategy.  To deliberately plan how you’re going to spend your money on
clothes.

Here are a few things to consider:

1.    Your Lifestyle

Look at how you spend your waking hours over the course of a week.  If it looks something like
this:

Work–60%
Social–20%
Leisure–20%

Then your wardrobe should consist of 60% work, 20% social (church, parties, visiting, etc.), and
20% leisure (running errands, watching TV, cleaning house) appropriate attire.

If you’re a stay-at-home mom and your time is spent like this:

With Kids–80%
Social–10%
Leisure–10%

Then your wardrobe should reflect this with 80% of what you wear appropriate to work with kids,
10% appropriate for social activities, and 10% appropriate for leisure time.

Adjust this according to your particular situation.

2.    Your Budget

You should spend anywhere from 3-10% of what you earn on clothing.  If you wear a uniform to work,
you’ll probably spend less (3%); if you’re in a high profile position (defense lawyer, socialite,
television personality), you’ll probably spend more (10%).  The average person should spend
around 6%.

REMEMBER:  This figure correlates to your household income and expenses.  So if your
household income is $50,000 per year, for example, you should allocate approximately 6% (or
$3,000) to clothe EVERYONE in the household.  If your household income is $100,000 per year, then
you have $6,000 (6%) to spread among the family. This isn’t per person, unless you live alone.
This is per household.

Once you know what kinds of clothes should be in your wardrobe and how much you should allocate in
your budget, see how your closet stacks up.  If your lifestyle is:

Work    - 60%
Social–20%
Leisure–20%

But your existing wardrobe is:

Work–90%
Social–3%
Leisure–7%

Then it’s no wonder you start looking for something to wear whenever you’re extended an
invitation, or that your errand clothes have holes in them because you wear the same two or
three things all the time.  It’s because your wardrobe doesn’t match your lifestyle.

So how do you fix it?

1.    Fill in The Gaps

Go spend some of your budget to fill in the gaps so that your closet reflects your lifestyle.

2.    Buy Mix-and-Match Items

Buy items that you can mix-and-match with other pieces in your wardrobe, not something that can
only be worn one way.

3.    Decide on A Color Scheme

If you look best in black, white, and blue, buy clothes in those colors and maybe only two or
three more (like red, taupe, and green).  If you lean toward a warm palette of gold, ivory, and
brown, then buy clothes in those colors and maybe two or three more (French navy, camel, peach).
Why?  Because they’ll mix-and-match with each other, as will your accessories.  You’ll get a
lot more“bang”for your money.

4.    Stick To Your Budget

Once you’ve determined how much you can spend on yourself for a season, make a list of what you
need to fill in the gaps, and head to the store with CASH.  No charge cards, checks, etc.  You’ll
find yourself carefully considering each purchase, and be a lot less likely to impulse
buy.  The end result?  You’ll only buy what you need.

Planning your wardrobe purchases DOES take time and a little practice, but can yield you great
rewards.  You’ll become better at working with what you already own instead of always assuming
you need something new.  Not only does this save you money, it also reduces all that closet
clutter so you can actually see what you have so you can wear what you own.

Summary:

Keywords:
neck tie tying, instructions neck tie tying, tying neck tie, steps to tying a neck tie

Article Body:
Getting ready for an interview can be hectic because many times you don?t know how to get that perfect look. This is quite important because many times you are unable to succeed in your interview in spite your great efforts and performance because of a bad impression of your dress code.

The following list shall give you a good idea of how to dress for a job interview:

 1. Suit ? You can wear a conservative two piece dark grey or dark blue business suit could be an ideal wear on the day of your job interview.

 2. Shirt ? A white, long sleeved dress shirt that is neatly pressed and if it has a good fit it would be the best.

 3. Tie ? Try to go for a plain colored, non distracting, conservative dark blue or dark red neck tie made of 100% pure silk.

 4. Tie accessories ? A classic silver tie bar will ensure that your tie is held at its place during the interview process so that you are not forced to adjust it several times that could also make you nervous during the interview process.

 5. Shoes ? Wear clean and polished conservative dress shoes, black lace ups if possible could be a great choice.

 6. Socks ? Dark socks, black would be ideally suited for the interview.

 7. Belt ? The belt should match the color of your shoes so try to go with a black one if possible.

 8. Hair ? Make sure that you get a well groomed hairstyle before the interview and also be aware that short hair always fares best in interviews.

 9. Beard ? The beard needs to be shaved off.

 10. Mustaches ? Mustaches could lead to a negative impact but though you have one try to keep it clean and trimmed.

 11. Fingernails- Keep your fingernails clean and trimmed because you are judged from top to bottom by the interviewer.

 12. Rings- No other rings except wedding and college rings are acceptable.

 13. Earrings and piercing- If you have earrings and other visible body piercing, you should take it off on the day of interview.

 14. Body odor and fresh breath- Always make sure that you don?t smell badly and chew some gum before the interview but never during the interview.

 15. Perfumes and colognes ? Keep your perfume and cologne to a minimum.

 16. Briefcase ? Take along a brief case with notepad and pen for any kind of notes you may have to take during or after the interview.

Dress shirts ought to be a staple in every stylish mans wardrobe. Some men save dress shirts for special occasions, a party, wedding, or after work drinks with the boss. Others use them to add a bit of luxury to their everyday dress. In either case, finding the right style and quality to suit your personal taste can sometimes be difficult.

Dress shirts connote a man not afraid to be himself, or to subtly display his success in the world. On the high street, however, there is often only a choice between tacky, mass produced dress shirts and ones that would require you to re-mortgage your house. Luckily, the internet has a wide range of specialist designers, for all price ranges–from the historic Savile Row Company to new and innovative dress shirt designers.

Comfortable cotton is the most popular fabric used, though you will also find fine garments made with silk and man-made materials. The fabric is important when choosing a dress shirt. You should consider your purchase as an investment to last a number of years.

Furthermore, high quality fabric benefits both the look and the feel of a shirt. Poor quality fabric is often treated with chemicals, and can cause skin irritation. To avoid this, look for 100% cotton. A split yoke fabric is a sign of quality, as it allows the fabric to fall across the shoulders without puckering or creases.

Other dress shirt fabrics include Oxford Broadcloth, which is famous for its durability and prestige; Seersucker, which is cool in summer and designed to have a crumpled, lightweight feel; and Silk Linen, a compound fabric that combines smooth durability with breath-ability.

These days, women expect men to have as good a sense of style as they do! So it is important to get the right colour and fit for you, especially if you plan to wear the shirt at a wedding or some other flirting opportunity. That is one plus of the Internet–dress shirts, ties and other accessories are often categorised by colours that match. This takes all the effort out of buying an outfit!

If you do buy online remember that when you have made your choice and the garment arrives that the colours may look different and not suit you, so make sure that the website has a good returns policy.

If you can afford it you should consider having shirts customised to your requirements. Some people prefer fitted dress shirts, others a loose design. Buying a customised dress shirt also gives you power over sleeve length, collar shape and lets you match the best fabric with the best shape.

You should know your measurements before buying any clothing online. The most accurate way of doing this is to use a shirt you already have, rather than getting someone to measure your body. Lay it out flat and measure from a centre of the collar to the shoulder, then from the shoulder line to the cuff. Then you are ready to buy the perfect dress shirt.

Do You Remember: Retro Fashion and 70s Nostalgia

Word Count:
523

Summary:
Jeans get tighter, bikinis get smaller, tube socks get higher, afros gets bigger and colors get brighter. It’s all about spreading the plumage for everyone to see. From leisure suits to Wallabees, fashions take on the decade of excessive behavior in a storm of polyester, iron-ons and platform shoes.

Keywords:
yesterdayland, nostalgic, retro, fashion, shows, tv listings, televisions, cream, miniskirt

Article Body:
 Take for example the Mini Skirt. 
Mary Quant, chanteuse of the swinging 60?s Carnaby Street, is credited as the first to reveal the ultra-short miniskirt. The mini was shocking, and not since the 20?s flapper had exposing your knee caused such a stir. Respectable ladies wore skirts at knee length, and young girls were supposed to follow the respectable path, but something happened when the daring Quant shortened skirts, and the world went mod.

Designer Andre Courreges is also credited with the mini?s creation, but Quant successfully commercialized the new freedom of teenage fashion, exposing the sexually explosive 60?s to the mini. The all-too-revealing miniskirt coincided with the birth of the sexual revolution, and exposed more than legs. The birth control pill hit the market in 1960, and in 1962, feminist and future Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown published Sex and the Single Girl, a support manual for young women who refused marriage but didn?t want to sacrifice the most primal urge. Sex was everywhere, and even more shocking than girls enjoying sex was that they were talking about it. And the miniskirt was the best advertisement for the sexual revolution.

Girls could strut their stuff, free to expose their sensuality, and men were just going to have to deal with it! No more covering up, keeping flesh under wraps because of the consequences of temptation. The miniskirt boldly stated the new confidence of a woman?s body, and her place in the feminine world. Protection and ?providing for? was no longer what the 60?s gal wanted. She called the shots, and in her sexy new miniskirt, she got what she wanted.

The miniskirt has remained a major staple throughout the years, as a sign of both sexuality and confidence (though we should warn you that showing thigh won?t instantly turn you into an Amazon princess. The mini might make you look sexy, but the confidence part is up to you). The 80?s returned the miniskirt back to pure unadulterated sensuality when Madonna slithered across the floor in thigh-high, black lycra miniskirts. Paired with lace tights and mesh shirts that exposed the navel, the 80?s miniskirt was unashamed and in your face. The 60?s mini was mild in comparison to the body-hugging shamelessness of 80′s cotton lycra.

The mini-skirt received even more controversy when it found its way into the professional realm of the 90?s. Heather Locklear?s ?Amanda? on Melrose Place stirred up attention in her skirts that barely hung below the hemline of her suit jackets. Professional women were conflicted: yes, the mini-skirt made your legs look fabulous, but was this going too far? When Calista Flockhart?s title character on Ally McBeal received more attention for her skirts than for her law practice, girls had to wonder if the line had been crossed.

Hemlines rise and fall faster than the stock market?where liberated women are down on the exchange floor beside their fellow man, thank you very much. The true fashion icon of the 60?s, the mini skirt is fearless: it allows women to celebrate their sexuality, and yet defies the old fashion convention of yesteryear.

In addition to maternity pants, shirts, skirts and dresses there are other items of clothing that can increase a pregnant woman’s comfort. Finding the right underwear is very important too. If you want to look good you need to feel good. Nursing bras should have the ability to stretch, which is why cotton bras are the most popular during and after pregnancy.

If you are wanting to continue feeling sexy for your husband you may experience the need for some maternity thongs. They have become a very popular item of late. They can be found in very soft fabrics that will stretch comfortably below a woman’s belly. They can be made of stretchy cotton fabric for the ultimate in comfort and also come in an assortment of exciting colors and prints. Just because you are pregnant doesn’t mean you can’t wear similar clothes that you are already used to.

Other items of clothing that can still be worn during this period are jeans and T-shirts. Jeans and T-shirts are specially made for mothers-to-be. They have special stretchy areas that will conform to your shape while still looking trendy and attractive.

Skirts and dresses can also be worn regularly during pregnancy. Skirts are probably the most popular form of apparel during this time of your life. They can fit loosely for comfort while hiding some of the extra shape you are doing your best not to display. Dresses are also popular for the same reasons. This type of apparel gives you a little extra room for both growth and comfort.

The main thing to watch out for is not buying outfits that are too snug to begin with. It’s usually wise to purchase apparel that has a little“growing into”room. Buying things too tight means you will outgrow it quicker. If you have a large shopping budget you may be able to get away with buying things to fit. But if you are looking to save money by going with cheap discounts you should consider finding maternity clothes that will have a little extra room for growth. By shopping this way you will be able to save money by wearing those funky clothes for a longer period of time.

Now that you can see how important it is to find cute, trendy and funky maternity clothing for both your comfort and your appearance it’s time to start searching for them. Shopping online allows you do find cute petite or lovely plus size outfits in the convenience of your own home. Once you know what’s out there you can then visit the retail stores and start trying on the clothes that will help you to feel the most beautiful possible.

Keywords:
Discount Plus Size Lingerie

Article Body:
Okay so like most clothes, lingerie of course comes in plus sizes. Granted the selection may not be a great or quite as sexy, but it is there. And of course like most clothes you can find discount lingerie. However where is this stuff to be found? The supply is not as prevalent as it is in smaller sizes. I have yet to see a Victoria?s Secret type of store for plus sizes, although I am sure one probably exists somewhere.

Well, if I was looking for discount plus size lingerie there are a few places I would look right away. First of all, as I am sure just about everyone in the United States, and much of the rest of the world, knows, Wal Mart sells lingerie. I mean, why not they sell everything else. So anyway, they do of course have plus sizes. I believe the section is even labeled as such. The selection is not that of a Victoria?s Secret or a Fredrick?s of Hollywood, but never the less it is there, and this is truly discount plus size lingerie.

Of course I am sure there are other stores that sell the same type of stuff. I have to say I am not sure if Lane Bryant or Fashion Bug Plus have lingerie sections, however as these are plus size stores, any lingerie they have would of course also be in plus sizes.

Now of course there is always the internet. There are store advertising online that ship internationally and domestically in the United States. There are both store devoted only to plus sizes and then there are those catering to both sizes. Some of these stores are simply for lingerie and others are for both lingerie and other clothes. I actually saw one that was advertising ?stripper shoes? as well, so I have a feeling if you are looking for something a little more risqué this may be the place to go. Whatever you are looking for I am sure it is out there somewhere it is just about finding the right discount plus size lingerie venue for you.

Dickies School Uniforms: Spice Up Your Academic Look

Students have it rough nowadays. Not only do they have to keep up with note taking, tests and essays, but they also have to deal with the pressure to sport the latest fashions at school just to fit in. A solution for some school administrators is to choose Dickies School Uniforms. By instituting required attire, it will lessen the burden of less fortunate families who don’t have the extra money to dish out for expensive and superfluous brand-name clothes.

Eliminating the tension of being made fun of for wearing second-hand or inexpensive clothing may not only send out a message of unification to the student body, but also allow for more concentration on the importance of education.

Dickies offers a variety of basic colors and styles of shirts and pants to choose from. For boys, tops can be as simple as short or long-sleeved twill or oxford shirts. Dickies also offer a crewneck pullover sweater or turtleneck for the cold winter months or chilly classrooms. For girls, shirts can be as modest as a polo shirt or as flourished as a tie back top or gathered blouse. Dickies school uniforms also stock pants for a unified look. A few choices include pleated and cargo looks. Flare-bottom trousers are also an option for a more hip“now”style.

An optional rule to allow students who are forced to wear school uniforms is to allow creative accessories such as tasteful pendants, buttons necklaces, iron-on patches, belts, and ribbons. Most school administrators reiterate that the Dickies school uniforms are not to be altered in any way and that all accessories must be removable.

Providing students with a means to lug those thick, heavy books around can also be a big help to the overloaded pupil. Dickies school uniforms also include book bag accessories that are available in both low-key plain styles and colors and unique designs amplified by bright hues.

If establishing a population-wide set school uniform is not possible, consider approaching extra curricular activity groups such as special interest clubs and music bands, and suggest that they use Dickies school uniforms. When a school organization shows up to a competition in matching uniforms, it sends an intimidating and well-put together message to the opposing team.

Having matching gear also provides the student member with a sense of belonging and importance. To look extra snazzy, purchase team jackets from Dickies school uniform selections, which are offered in solid color or two tones designs.

Sometimes, school budgets simply do not have enough funds to cover such luxuries as Dickies school uniforms. Many school sports, art and music classes are being cut from school curriculums because of financial reasons. If this is the case in your school, don’t give up hope. Make collecting money for Dickies school uniforms for your team or social club a group effort by allowing after-school time for fundraising projects, such as bake sales, car washes, auctions or, a house cleaning service or donation jars. Raising money for your own Dickies school uniforms will not only impress school administrators, but also provide you with a sense of accomplishment and accentuate your team spirit.
