 There are many benefits of home window tint, also known as solar window film, which is applied to the exterior side of windows. Installing home window tint is not done for a decorative motive, like it is with decorative window film that is applied inside the house. Instead, the purpose of solar window film is to deflect the direct sunlight. There are a number of reasons that you might want to do this . . . 

 Protect your home 

 

 
 



 

 Sunlight that comes into the house is phenomenal for fading carpet, drapes and furniture. The heat from it can also damage electronics and digital items and cause wood to warp.

In addition to its blocking power, solar window film can passively reflect and absorb up to 70% of incoming solar heat which keeps it from entering the house. Don&apos;t put up with damage from &quot;natural elements&quot; inside your home. Protect your material items, keep them in excellent shape and make them last longer. 

 Improve finances (and relationships) by conserving energy 

 Does your home life consist of constant arguments over the utilities bills? Whoever is in charge of paying the bills can be a real nag when it comes to outrageous energy bills. Nobody likes to be told not to turn on the air conditioner when they are really hot. Home window tint is the solution!

Solar window film decreases the heat that comes in from the outside which make it easier and cheaper to keep the house cool in the summer 

 Guard your privacy 

 Privacy matters, but why would you want to keep your shades pulled down all the time? Home window tint ensures that privacy during the day and it doesn&apos;t block your view of the world!

Home window tint comes in many different types. If you want to protect the privacy inside your home, choose a tint with a higher reflective rate. That way, you can see out but you can&apos;t see in during the day. At night it does not ensure as much privacy, so it is good to close the blinds at night after you&apos;ve enjoyed the view all day! 

 Other Applications: 

 Marine: 

 



 

 





 
 



 Do you own a boat or yacht? Are you looking to enhance the way it looks, or just provide some relief from the sun while out on the water? If so, let us know!

We can tint all types of glass on boats, no matter how big or small your craft may be. Like our residential and commercial window film, all of our marine tint comes with a lifetime warranty. We offer varying degrees of darkness to suit your privacy or comfort needs.

Tinting the windows in your watercraft blocks harmful UV rays, protects the upholstery and valuables inside your boat and creates privacy for you and your passengers. Our marine window film has a durable scratch-resistant coating and will not interfere with any electronic devices while you are enjoying a day or evening out on the water. 

 Aviation: 

 Our window films will improve comfort and cut energy costs by reducing heat loss and solar heat gain through windows. 

The films will improve aesthetics by providing uniformity to the exterior appearance of windows, while not impairing the view. Other benefits include reduction of UV damage to interior materials, reduced temperature imbalances between sunny and shady areas of the aircraft, improved glass safety and decreased glare from outside. 

 



 
 

 



 



 By investing in many equipments and gadgets for measuring the actual characteristic of the films, L.A. Window Film Company ( our sister company for residential and commercial projects ) has an accurate and a non-biased way of determining the best film suited for any situation, be it for heat rejection, privacy, security or all three.
