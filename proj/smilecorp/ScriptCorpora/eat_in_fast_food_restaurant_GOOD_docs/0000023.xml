**A: no it&apos;s not. Wed, 26 Oct 2005 01:28:00 GMT (3) It would seem like spamming to me. do you get charged for each text message you send because the person on the other end is charged when they look at it. I dont think it is feasible because your return rate is not going to be very good. I know if I saw a text message ad come up on my phone I would just delete it. Take what you will have to pay for the text messaging and put it into newspaper ads instead or a yellow pages ad. Wed, 26 Oct 2005 10:07:00 GMT (4)
