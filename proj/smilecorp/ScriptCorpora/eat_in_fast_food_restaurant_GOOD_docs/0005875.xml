 Growing old with Girlfriend 
 
 One of the great advantages of getting older is the ability to pretend you are losing your hearing. I have finally entered that secret society where the men of my family that started saying ...“ehhh?” , long before their retirement. I now understand why my father and grandfather, after mumbling it, were always smiling. “Bernie, did you forget about playing bridge with the Herberts?” . I too just smile. Of course, sharing the same interests with my girlfriend, as we get older, is something I cherish. We have always had a mutual love for travel, animals and the environment. Lately, however, we have added reading glasses, bran and naps to our common interests. We still talk about exercise but it is no longer scuba diving or kayaking. Now I hear how far away I parked from the Macy’s front door and how she doesn’t have the right shoes for this type of exertion... (never understood why anything on your foot should not be for walking). We still take our daily constituitons but instead of a thinner waste, we do it for digestion. I think it is one of life’s ironies that when it becomes important to read the ingredient labels on boxes, the print is too small. And when you can afford the many nice restaurants, the light is often too faint to make out the menu. I often ask the waiter what he recommends, not because I care for his opinion but rather as a way to find out what is on the menu. Italian restaurants are the worst. They seem to feel if they italicize a few words or drop a little Italian in each sentence the food is going to taste more like your grandmothers.

My daughter has taught me one very important lesson. Never eat at a restaurant that has pictures of the food. Never once did you come home for dinner and upon asking, were you handed photos. Don’t change what works. Of course going to eat at 4-5 pm has its advantages. You usually get to see the waitress tie on a clean apron as her shift is just beginning and the menus have not become scratch and sniff cards from a bad John Water&apos;s film. There are only lines when the local Grizzler has their ‘ Seniors eat for Half Price Thursdays ’. They are a pretty shrewd company, however. First, they offer a whole host of menu items that fall into the ‘Oh…I can’t eat that’ category…or more often you will hear my girlfriend say much louder than normal, “ Bernie, don’t eat that…you know what happens when you eat that !”                                                                                                                                                          Actually I do, it will irritate the hell out of her. There is a theory that matches were intended to make starting fires easier. Frankly, it was to keep one bathroom marriages intact. 
 Any early buffet is a study in silver, blue, yellow and the no hairs. The first and last need not mention. The middle two, however, must come from some chemical reaction used somewhere in the preening process. The blue I kind of get, blue is really very close to the color white. Yellow just seems avoidable. My grandmother said it was from men using hair tonic. I asked her why it never turned my grandfather’s thick mane yellow.“ Because your grandfather never put it on his hair, he drank his” .
Secrets from the grave; the makers of my family were starting to reveal their secrets. I still remember when I found my first gray hair. I was 50. Thankfully, I found it on my girlfriend&apos;s head.

 My girl&apos;s sense of humor has deepened too. She thinks she knows what my jokes are going to be and I make an effort to be original. “You’re not funny” , is her favorite comment and every time she does,I respond with the multi cultural response,   “Oh yeah? Well pull my finger!” 
An act of self-preservation she has never acted upon. I plan on saying that to her when I am on my death bed. She will say no at first but she will then acquiesce since it will be my final wish. Understand I have planned this for 20 years. I just want to be able to use the punch line after she pulls my finger... “Man…it smells like death in here” . Get it...? I am on my death bed? I know...I can hear my girlfriend now, “You&apos;re not funny” .


 
 
 I was asked if we were going to be buried together in matching plots. I say why would I want to spend all eternity sleeping next to her when we have separate bedrooms now? Hard to believe I would be asked this when I have one foot nearing the grave. I am getting too old for two steps forward and one step backward. She did promise, though, that if I die first she was going to have my gravestone engraved with... &quot;Now, that was funny&quot;

 BEING put out to PASTOR ... 
 I don&apos;t have any complaints with church. Go if you want, stay home if you want. I have read that more people are choosing to stay home than ever before so I wondered what would get them to come back. I have always felt that the church signs have long gone to waste. I don&apos;t care about a scripture passage or what time the service is that I will be sleeping through. Here are a few of my thoughts for the marquee and how to drive traffic.

 Tithe Free Sunday !!!! 
 Want to do something your Parents never did ? Come to Church regularly !!! 
 Free Valet Parking in Heaven, get your ticket validated here !!! 
 Indulgences ! Buy one get one FREE !!!  

 1969 French Communal Wine !!!  


 
 

 
I actually went into a church that had one of these sayings. I was also intrigued by the Superman cape that was dangling from the Church Spire. Apparently not even those with super powers could avoid getting caught in this Church. Before I entered the sanctuary, however, I bent down to get a drink at the fountain and the water stormed across my face and head. An electric message clicked on ...
&quot; You have just been baptized at the HOLY CHURCH OF THE REDEEMED! Please follow the blinking arrows to get your new Christian packet !&quot;.
I shook my head like a dog and then took a seat in the back pew. All the parishioners turned around and after seeing my drenched Hawaiian shirt they nodded their approval. Some even mouthed &apos; Welcome&apos;.

The music started and there were choir women in their long frocks working the pipe organs like strippers. One old woman really had the moves ! Apparently her husband? thought so too as he was dancing in the front row with his arms up and palms facing Heaven ! The Pastor came out and talked about sin, being saved, making mistakes and still being loved. What I liked is every time he talked about making a mistake, he blew on A slide whistle and every time he talked about being loved, he hit a gong. I thought that was a nice touch and I couldn&apos;t wait to talk to him after the service.

&quot;Hi, I&apos;m Bernie&quot;, I put out my hand. He grabbed it and gave me a hug.
&quot;You look a lot like a David Flannery I once knew... but Welcome Bernie, We love when Jews convert !&quot; He smiled looking at my wet shirt.
&quot;I&apos;m not Jewish&quot; , I said.
&quot;Not anymore!&quot; He kept smiling. &quot;So, what brings ya here today, got some eternal questions?&quot;
&quot;No, not really. Well... I do wonder why when the cardinals go to pick the pope the vote isn&apos;t unanimous. Aren&apos;t they suppose to be doing God&apos;s will? And I&apos;m stumped why some people have two or three creases on the inside of their elbow, often inches apart, when the elbow only bends one way.&quot; I smiled back.
&quot;Oh my gosh, the Lord brought me a deep thinker today! Maybe you should come to our Christian Barbecue and we could go over some things&quot;
&quot;That sounds fairly cannibalistic&quot;, I smiled even deeper.
&quot;Holy Jesus, smart.... AND a sense of humor, what have I done to deserve this?&quot; His teeth smiled out of his face.
&quot;Come on Bernie, don&apos;t you want to experience life to the fullest, to love others, to make a difference, to be happy and to maybe even have kids&quot;?
&quot;Well Pastor, I had my tube tied with barbed wire so if I even think about kids it hurts&quot;
&quot;It might be time to loosen that grip my new friend, ever read the Bible?&quot;
&quot;I think of reading the Bible like I think about walking on hot coals, I let others do it.&quot;
&quot; Hmmm, so you have an opinion on a book you have never read?&quot;
&quot;Not really&quot; I added, &quot; I just read the end and it didn&apos;t seem like a very happy ending for most so I figured why go any further?&quot;
&quot; Listen, you may have missed the point, can you come back next week? We are firing up Hebrews! I mean Hebrew Franks... ha ha ha, not Hebrew Bernies !&quot;
&quot; I told you I&apos;m not Jewish&quot;
&quot;I know, I can see your shirt !&quot;
&quot;Wait &quot; I said, &quot; I am not sure how happy I am with this church&quot;
&quot;Don&apos;t worry, think how we must feel having you as a member!&quot; He bent over laughing.
He hugged me, curtsied with his robe and then starting singing down the hallway when he turned back and yelled,
&quot;Come back next week Bernie, we&apos;ll give you something you can sink your teeth into and you&apos;ll want to come back for seconds and thirds! Remember, staying in bed shouting, Oh GOD ! Does not constitute going to church!&quot;
He smiled, gave me the thumbs up and kept walking.

 THIS is ONLY a TEST... 
 Every once in a while I get a notice to quickly turn the radio station. It is not the normal Viagra commercial but the ever annoying Emergency Broadcast System signal. I am pretty sure they can test their system without making the same screeching noise as my girlfriend on the rare occasion she wants to be amorous.

I think if the Emergency Broadcast System were to be of any value it would give people practice at living a real emergency. If a proverb is to have meaning, like practice makes perfect, we need to apply it. So next time, the only high pitched sound you will hear will be your own scream.

Once a month, you car will automatically shut down. It will be a no start in the garage as you are praying there is no traffic or better yet it will be as you barrel down the highway, following way to close to the person in front of you while you put on your mascara or as you scratch yourself... choose your sexual preference. Your skill set will increase as you learn how to ride a bus or learn how to drive to the safety berm of a highway without having your child spill their Cheerios. I would also make the bus late and have the berm disappear as you approach a bridge. It is important to crack this dependency, because much like cocaine, there are no physical withdrawal symptoms but you will think there are when you see the mood changes sweep over people as they realize their day planner is useless.

Your cell phone and email will stop working for a week. That is a short time, remember we have only really had them for about 15 years...so no whining.  This will give you the experience of living through a hurricane, when electricity can only come off a generator that you never bought. You should also experience the necessity of watching your cell battery die. Many travelers know this feeling but since you are not sure when it will come back on, you will have to decide who will receive your precious last few calls. Will it be your family, your lover, your work or the Block Buster to see if how much you will be charged for not returning Girls Gone Wild?

My favorite is the television. It will go off 10 minutes before the hour, several times a night. I think it is important to miss the ending of all of your shows. It will be a reminder you will miss the last 10 minutes of your life since we are never given that much warning. When it does go on, it show only Latin programming, you should get use to the new language that the majority will be speaking in 10 or 20 years. And for you History buffs, when the city of New York (New Amsterdam) was settled, they had 24 speaking languages so again, no whining. Your DVR and recorder will also automatically erase and will reload with cable access coverage of the House of Representatives during a Filibuster. While you can wonder why things aren&apos;t working, you can witness why the government doesn&apos;t work.

Men will have a penis failure when it is least convenient but I have a feeling, based on all of the advertising I try to avoid, that many are already getting this emergency message. Women could also have trouble with orgasms but again...

You might wonder why I suggest any of these things. I think it is because we are spoiled and we no longer take the time to know our communities let alone our neighbors. Although I truly believe that when the crunch would come, many would rise up and tackle the challenge. At first, however, we will kick, scream and curse God. We are all His children and often that is how we act.

So if you wish to avoid the shock of the above emergency planning events. Leave your car and phone at home and go for a walk in the woods while holding someone’s hand. Remember, practice makes perfect.

 Exercise Takes Years off of Your Life 
 I have been exercising for a month and I have noticed two very distinct differences. First, I now look in the mirror way more than a dog does, hoping for pit bull results. It is like eating a salad at night and then seeing if you can fit into a smaller size in the morning.  And secondly, I have gained 8 pounds.

What makes this month a miracle is that for every week of my life since I was 11, I was going to start an exercise routine. It all began with the 1972 Olympics when I watched a race and then bolted off the couch running 3 miles down the road. I never did it again. Despite this setback, I have never missed a week of thinking about exercising in the last 30 years. I suspect that this thinking, worring and subsequent disappointment have taken 7 years off of my life. The same as if I smoked.

They are some motivating facts that may keep me going. They say you lose 10 % of your muscle mass every ten years ,starting when you are twenty. So I have lost 30% of my my muscle and I did not begin with much. A few more decades of inactivity and a tumbleweed will resist the wind better than me. I also am drawn to the idea it gets me out of the house. I tried to exercise at home but my girlfriend kept complaining that having the stationary bike next to the refrigerator was in her way and defeating the purpose. I found it hard to argue with her since my mouth was always full. Probably the best reason is you feel better. It wasn&apos;t till the end of this month that I got shit, shower and shave in the right order for the first time in my life.

One day I noticed one of the instructors parading a bunch of kids around the executive area. This is what I had needed, a tour. Still hoping there was something I could learn, I listened in.
The trainer asked, &quot;What is the first thing you do when you get in the shower?&quot; 
One little boy threw up his arm and shouted &quot;You pee!&quot;. I knew he was executive material.
She went on, &quot;What do you use when you come out of the shower?&quot;,
 The same kid shouted, &quot;A towel, but sometimes a shirt &quot;
&quot;Boys are stupid&quot;, a girl added. She clearly was executive material.
&quot;My brother used toilet paper and he had to take another shower:&quot;, another girl added.
Maybe I wasn&apos;t going to learn anything after all, since I hadn&apos;t heard anything I hadn&apos;t done.

There are some tips I wished I would have had before I started my membership. Never walk into a new gym and while touring the shower area, populated with nude males, mention you just stopped in to see how everything looked. Also, never use a piece of gym equipment after a woman, it is embarrassing to have to lower the weight. I was shocked when I could only bench press 50 lbs on my first day. I wasn&apos;t getting any dates and it also meant that if a 4th grader wrestled me to the ground, I would not be able to free myself.

A real surprise was the idea that you are supposed to look good when you go to the gym...nice shoes, cool shorts and top. I never got this since the reason I was going to the gym was because I didn&apos;t look good. Putting nice clothes on me is like icing a cake that hasn&apos;t been cooked.
And I finally understand why they are mirrors everywhere. They are placed at every angle so after you pay your membership and buy work out clothes from their boutique, you catch a glimpse of yourself and never return.

I am also aware of opposing forces that could bring this all to end. Mainly, I never stick to anything, I have even given up breathing several times but there was always someone there to bring that back. I am also a memeber of the ADD club. In fact, I am it&apos;s President. They actually invented ADD medicine because of me. I lost in interest in my own wedding. I didn&apos;t watch Dallas until JR was shot.

But I don&apos;t exercise so I will look good in a swim suit or to get a model girl friend. I have experienced both and they are over rated. Nor do I do it to avoid  becoming  the latest beached white male. The truth is, if I spend an hour a day in the gym, for the next 25 years, I will have spent an entire year exercising and there is no guarantee this will extend my life.

All in all, I am not sure whether all this attention will extend my life but after all is said and done, I will probably be trim enough to fit into my final suit

 Dating in the Drive Thru... 
 
 
 
 It was bad enough that I was going on a date in my 40&apos;s, let alone my fourth blind date in the last year. No one plans such things. Instead of feeling 15 because of butterflies in my stomach, I felt 15 because she picked me up in her mini van. It was like 8th grade all over again, I expected her mother to appear in the backseat but, that would occur later. 
 
It was the Sunday after Christmas and only the Grocery store and McDonald&apos;s had their lights on. Since I wanted to show her the town, I made sure to take her to both places. We pulled into the fast-food restaurant and she asked if I wanted to go in, or use the drive thru. I said we should go inside to get the full experience. ( I was hoping Ronald&apos;s Playroom was closed, nothing worse than an inflexible 40 year old being asked to show off ). I ordered and handed the pimply teenager 10 dollars for the meals and he asked me if my date qualified for the McDiscount for Senior citizens. I shook my head and reached in my pocket to handed him my man card.  Apparently as I approached my 50&apos;s, I wouldn&apos;t need it anymore. I took my tray and grabbed the brochure for the discounted McCoffin.

We sat down with our plastic meals and she asked if she could call her mother.
I said, &quot; Why, it&apos;s still light out ?&quot;
She smiled and said, &quot; She just wants to know if I made it all right&quot;
I asked, &quot; Does she know you are on blind date?&quot;
&quot;No, are you crazy?&quot; ( I never answer that question).
Being the gentleman, I told her to go ahead but, first I asked her if she wanted some fries with her phone call. She politely refused. I realized I might be making too big of a deal of McDonald&apos;s, I would hate to get naked later and have her ask me if I would super-size it.

As she nibbled and as I gorged, she kept asking all the necessary questions. Why did I live where I live, What do I do for a living, Why did I come to this state, Why did my home look like a crack house? I can answer all pre-coital questions with one answer, &quot; I don&apos;t know&quot; (and that is not being a smart ass). I then mumbled something about how most things I do seem like a good idea at the time. I didn&apos;t ask her much but, questions. but when I did it was well thought out.

&quot;How many of your friends did you give my home address to?&quot;
&quot;All of them&quot; She smiled.

Later, as the coffee was almost finished she starting telling me about her ex-husband and why her marriage didn&apos;t work.
&quot;You know, that is taboo on the first date&quot;, I mentioned.
&quot;What is?&quot; She asked.
&quot;Talking about your ex. I never talk about my ex&apos;s. I prefer to show pictures, here&quot; , I reached for my wallet.
&quot;Oh my God...You are kidding , right ? &quot; Her mouth dropped to the Hamburgler place mat.
&quot; Yes, I am kidding&quot;, shaking my head in disbelief, &quot; the pictures are nudes and they never leave the house!&quot;

McDonald&apos;s was changing from Breakfast to their Lunchtime fare and this excitement was making me think about dinner. I asked her if she could drive me to the Grocery Store so I could buy a frozen entree. I of course asked if she too would like a frozen dinner. She said she would, so we placed our trays away and we headed to her child carrier. She clicked the beeper and the van unlocked as the side panel door slid open. I half expected 2 guys wearing masks to jump out and grab me.
&quot;That&apos;s great for dry cleaning&quot;, she pointed out. I looked back at the kid who now owned my Man card . He was wiping our table and waving to me.
&quot;Travel well my young friend, travel well&quot; , I thought.

On to the second tier of the date...I suppose that standing in front of the freezer section was a good time to get to know about each other. It became obvious that neither one of us liked vegetables. We were only staring at frozen meat. Would she pick a Lean cuisine ( God, I hoped not) or a Hungry man ( God, I hoped not ). I refused to pull out my coupons or to guide her to the items that were discounted if I used my Clown Town Buyers Card. She seemed aware of my peril since she handed me a box and said &quot; Here, this one is on sale&quot; I let slip, &quot; Excellent !&quot;. We grabbed a large beverage and we moved to the cashier. I was hoping my gold plated debit card was impressing her. I decided not to use my food stamp card, even though it was prettier. The sale went through which was like an omen for a second date. What could go wrong now?

Now, she had already seen my house which begs the question as to why she was willing to return. It occurred to me why she liked her automatic side door, she was going to do a drive by and I was going to be tossed onto the never mowed front lawn. She had seen my chipped tooth and apparently was impressed how it made me whistle whether I wanted it to or not.

I live in a 3 bedroom house in one of the nicer neighborhoods in this sleepy town but, the previous owner was doing time. The windows are all painted ( and I mean the glass, not the wood frames ) and every room looks like a lion was ill fed and not allowed to leave. There is wall paper missing and gouge marks that would frighten a bear. What ever remodeling was attempted was done by a dyslexic Bob Vila. I was tempted to look under the new hard wood floors to see if there was carpet.The first floor was a vision into WW2 London with all the bombing and heat peeled wall paper.
Ever aware about creating mood, I started a fire by putting in a starter log and newspaper. I did not have any wood. She said she would do anything for a roaring fire. I started breaking up some of the furniture. I burnt my finger lighting trying to add awkward pieces of my futon. I shrieked smoothly and just said fires make me sing like Prince. The blaze became impressive but the lacquer treated wood did not smell so good.

Did she end up seeing the 2nd floor? A gentleman never discusses these things... but the date did end well and I know this since she called me the next day and not the police.
   Need dating help? Well, you are screwed but here are some links ...

 The Perfect Crime and Other Blunders 
 Every Since I was a young child, I wanted to pull off the perfect crime. I had high ideals. I loved the idea of stealing millions and living in Tahiti for the rest of my life. I realize I have just spoiled those plans since I have just given written proof of intent and where I can be found. Tahiti does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, howeverm so if I got there, with prior intent or not, I could still live in hut with my feet dangling in the water. Maybe that is where the shark will finally get me.

What threatened my plans was I kept growing. Smaller than 6 foot would have been okay. But God had other plans since I pushed 6 inches past 6 ft. Now, the only place I blend in is at basketball camp. I could not slip out the back of a bank or casino and casually walk down the street since my head would be a good 6-10 inches above the other bobbing heads. Inspector Gadget would not need any toys to find me. I have yet to see a single movie where a really tall guy gets away with anything. We usually play the role of the guy in jail that the hero knocks out to win everyone&apos;s respect.

One would think this would naturally have lead me to be the organizer and the man that is never seen in crime dramas but I was not smart enough. I had not met any real criminals or anyone with my criminal intent, my fault for not having spent enough time in jail. Tall or not, I was going to have to learn the way every one else does, trial and error and mostly by myself.

I started stealing whatever I could from my Mom’s meager purse and from my neighbors. No honor among theives here. A few quarters were never missed in a pool of change. It cost 50 cents for lunch so when I took a few quarters, I was rolling in it. I would steal my sister’s rings in 6th grade and give them to my girlfriend. This worked wonders. My sister probably thought she lost them and my girlfriend loved the gifts. The plan unraveled when I realized my sister was staring a hole in the back of my head on the bus. We all rode the bus together and my girlfriend was showing off her new ring. It became pretty obvious that although I had the initial social dysfunction to steal, I was not too smart. I knew I needed to learn more before I went on.

My plan was to go to a library and at gun point, demand all the books on money. The fact that it may take the librarian a good a hour to round them all up could lead to my capture but I have scoped out many libraries and the security is really lax. My problem would be to remember not to give my library card or to show back up when the books were due. I thought maybe I should start with a small county library and work my way up.

I ended up skiping the Library, however, as I deemed it too risky. I went right to shop lifting. I had an 8th grade friend that hatched a scheme and I was invited in. Like any good gangster film, I was the hired help. I was not the brains of the operation which was probably a smart decision but the shear boldness of the plan definitely pointed to lack of intellect. While I diverted the girl at the cash register, my friend crawled behind her and grabbed a carton of cigarettes. In the early 70’s they were kept right at the counter. We did not take into consideration that there would be other people in line. I could see my friend’s ass wiggle as he bent to to fearlessly grab our stash. The store manager or bag guy could have caught us at any time. Some how, we pulled it off but, thankfully it was our first and last heist together. He later grew up to become the mayor.

I went solo on the shoplifting and my escape plan was always to run. I never had to and it built a laziness and an I can get away with anything mentality.
I shimmied up the crime pole by moving onto cars.

The first time I tried it, it was as easy as waking up on a spring morning. I am not sure how many times I would go for joy rides but at one point I invited a friend and we went into town and all over the country side. I ran around so much that I had to get gas. The attendant knew I was 13 and called the police. The police were waiting for me with a 2 car trap when I neared home so I tried to avoid them. The quickly saw it was me and had me pull over. I handed them my brother’s license that claimed I was 16. Back then, there were no pictures just a vague description. The police officer looked at the license and then at me.

“Aren’t you Bernie&quot;?
“Hardly&quot;! I snickered.
“That is my younger brother, I‘m Wayne”I smiled.
“That was an amazing shot you made to win the basketball game on Tuesday”the officer added.
“Thanks”I said.
As soon as the words left my mouth, I realized that my brother, Wayne, was a basketball legend in this small town and I was busted. The cop knew all along that my hairless chin was not that of my brother’s. What really took it down the wrong road was when he leaned down and held the flashlight on my friend. It was his nephew.

My only punishment was that I had to spend the night at my friend’s house and that should have been enough since I thought his father was going to kill me. I slept in the living room, still alive, thinking of my next heist.

I realized it was time to move on to banks. I didn’t see this as any big deal. The tellers are trained to just give you the money while they press the button. I just needed 30 seconds for one drawer to be emptied and another minute if I wanted to add any others. I did this without fail and walked calmly out of the bank with a sack full of money. I would have gotten away with it had I not stopped to write my name in some wet cement.

 2012 and The End of Sanity 
 It is soon to be the end of 2010 which means we are only a scant two years away from the end of the world in 2012. The Mayan calendar ends but already the sanity of millions has already ended. The ancient calendar does not start again which some have taken to mean that we are all going to die. Over the years we have developed a buffet of ways to be exterminated so it is really your personal preference, i.e. nuclear, asteroid, plague, earthquake, famine or flood. It is hard to chose a favorite.

It may soften your demise if you realize that every day 150,000 thousand people die, so for them the end came sooner than 2012. By the time the Mayan calendar comes to an end and we all go to the great beyond, almost 10 million people will have died. That is if all goes well, so your death whenever it happens, is statically really not that important.

There has to be a reason why we believe such silly things. I do believe part of it is the size of our brain, 90% of it is used to run the body. The other 10% is for thinking and planning. Not a lot of space for intelligence especially if you use some of it for fantasy football and television. Then again, that is the inmate commenting on the asylum. As a result, I have come to realize that wisdom processes no gene and is not passed on from generation to generation. It seems we all have to learn the hard way. A friend of mine called me the most brilliant stupid man she had ever met. I tended to agree with her, that way at least half of me had merit but that is when I am using 100% of my brain.

Learning the hardest way is my way of life. I literally had to get burned numerous times by hot objects before I got a healthy respect for them. The stove is obvious but heat comes in many forms, so I have many marks. In fact, I was not pre wired for much of anything other than self destruction. As a baby I couldn’t feed myself and what I thought was edible, which was anything I could stick in my mouth, were constant perils to my life. As soon as I could walk , then run, I headed for stairs, back doors , busy streets and angry dogs. At age four I ran off the dock at Lincoln’s log cabin home into the pond. I saw bright lights before my dad yanked me out of the water. There is no reason I survived until age 5 without the constant watch of a stay at home mom. Even at that age, when I took my first leap from the roof to the ground 10 feet below, I was lucky that I had chosen thick grass and not concrete or I would be writing this with my feet because I landed on my outstretched hands. I have not jumped off a roof since.

A study of history ( like anyone does this) and we can step away from the personal morbidity that you are going to die and certainly not on the day or way of your choosing. The world has constantly, and I mean constantly, felt it was being wiped off the face of the planet for good. It does not matter if it is a country that feels this or a town. Whether it is today or 2000 years ago. It is a feeling of doom and instant mortality that as individuals we have never conquered.

The black plague, in the 1500’s, took out one out of four people. Hopefully it was the annoying person at work that caught it and not the co-worker you adored. Imagine the money that could have been made had embalming and funeral parlors been invented. When the portable canon was invented whole towns gave up without a shot being fired, just having it pointed at them was enough. I would imagine if they had school desks, this would be the time when kids had to crawl under them. The English Long bow’s invention had all of Europe convinced it was the end. The bow could shoot twice as far as any bow ever made. Kids didn’t play cops and robbers they played English Bowman and running Frenchman. Fortunately, The game never caught on, but a later version called Cowboys and Indians did.

The American Indians lived with end times for 75 years and almost all of them got to see it. They didn’t need a calendar. Every young child grew up thinking it was their last day, the white man would soon be killing them, either with a knife , gun, small pox or whiskey. And by the way, we Europeans started the practice of scalping, not the Indians. Daniel Boone was a hero for killing Indians. Nowadays, we think it is a problem when a kid worships a baseball player. Seems to me we are improving.

The old saying that pay back is a bitch may have its roots with the way we treated the Central and North American Indians. Although the Mayans were entirely wiped away, they came up with a great pay back. They have millions worried and believing the end of the world is coming. Very few writers get that level of immortality. What is left of the North American Indians now own most of the casinos and all of the Hard Rock establishments. I hope they bankrupt every idiot that puts a bet on the table. When the European descendent places his last bet then yells,
“I lost everything, my life is over!”
The Native Indian will smile and say
“Exactly”.
Pay back, but with interest.

So, the Mayan calendar runs out in December of 2012. My calendars runs out every January ( they always seem to give you an extra month to realize you need another one) and other than broken resolutions and added pounds, nothing bad has ever happen. I just read this morning, however, that the proposed scholars have interpreted their calendar wrong and we may have another 50 years to live. What a shocker. Remember the Mayans could not predict their own demise let alone the worlds. Don’t worry, something else will pop up.

 Adam and Eve and The Garden of Laughs 
 I often think about what if would have been like to be Adam and Eve or at least to be the proverbial fly on the wall or on the fig tree in this case. It doesn’t surprise me that the two wore fig leaves, The fig is probably the fruit must responsible for the variety of life on this planet and certainly proof of this lies in the fact it is overly predominant in the Amazon rain forest. You probably have a version in your yard or house, depending on where live. Don&apos;t dress with the local varietie&apos;s leaves, however, they are quite small.

My first thought is there was always fidelity in their marriage. Eve did not worry if Adam came home late, since there were no loose women or beer guzzling guys to hang out with ( which makes me question if it was really paradise). Since they walked around mostly naked, Eve never had to check his collar for lipstick and a hickey would have stood out. Turtle necks would be invented later, first by the turtles and then by some French guy wanting to hide a boil or some mark. I think that is how the modern day neck tie came to be, which is just another reason to hate the French..

If you have ever spent a long weekend with your lover, past the point of having to have sex twice a day ( that is an expression, don’t judge yourself), you know that is an aweful long time to spend with one person. This can only last peacably for exactly 2 days which is why God created weekends. How Adam and Eve spent entire weeks together, for years, is without question the biggest riddle of the Bible. There were no kids or family to talk about. No office managers to call stupid, no neighbors that were crazy. No aspirations.  Why write a book if there is no one to read it? If you made a piece of art and the other did not like it, well that meant every human alive hates your work.There life was so Boring that even the Bible only gave these two a few pages.  If God thinks your life is only worth a brief mention, things are not that exciting.

I imagine that in the Garden, there was a river that was liquid valium. This is the only way I can see that it would feel like paradise. The only thing Adam and Eve had to do was...shit, shower and hopefully shave. There were no bathrooms, however, so they dropped their morning message on the ground like every other animal in the world. I can only assume that by bathing daily in the river of valium, they were not only clean but could handle the sheer monotony of the up coming day. As far as shaving goes, the hair was probably flying. It was everywhere with nothing of the necessary bald spots we seem to require these days.

There has been an age old question as to whether the two of them had belly buttons. The answer is of course…who knows? My brain has to handle my breathing without my input since apparently if I had to think about it, like when I am swimming, I would just forget to do it. I know there are many questions I was not meant to ask or even answer.

It doesn’t prevent me from wondering about things, however. For example, at some point being a woman, Eve would have wanted to get rid of the fig leave and start some level of fashion. I have yet to know a woman who wore the same thing two days in a row. How do you look sexy to a man if you only wear leaves day after day? So why not blame the need to put away your white clothes when fall comes around on her too. I would think she said to Adam one day,“If you really loved me, you would get me a fur”. Adam, not really knowing what she was asking, cause men are like that, would probably go out with a list to find his wife her new covering. I can see him taking off his fig leave and putting a squirrel over his groin. He quickly realized that fur should be dead before being place over your groin, especially one’s that likes nuts.

This type of living would inevitably lead to dissatisfied thinking which would lead to the harvesting of the tree of life. Here is something you can not have, and God will place it right next to where you sleep. One bite and no more boredom, answers galore and no more wardrobe malfunctions. I would not have taken a single bite of an apple, I would have made pies. It could not have been too hard for the snake to convince Eve to insert her incisors into the fruit. ( even though the Bible never mentions a snake or an apple).
I think Adam is as much to blame, he probably told the snake to do it.
“I don’t care what happens, it may not be better but, at least it will be different!”

I believe paradise didn’t end with the apple but actually when Adam realized there were other women. I see Eve standing with another woman with a very disgusted Adam looking on. They are still in Figs since Adam never figured the out fashion. Eve very flatly says to Adam
“I am sorry , but I have decided to turn over a new leaf !”
Now Adam was rightly upset. First there was the whole apple thing and now there is a new girl on the block and she appears to be a lesbian. Adam was probably not sure how he was going to get along since masturbation was also a no-no. I usually think I can get away with it since God has 6 billion other people to watch but when there are only 2 or 3 of you, well…you can bet God is with you from the beginning.

It is said we have our faults and sins because of these two. Not the inheritance I was expecting as I got older. As a child, whenever I would get caught doing something wrong I would simply say
“Talk to Adam and Eve, I had nothing to do with it”. So the two got banished, Eve went on to populate the Earth way too much and Adam went on to destroy the planet and build places like Hooters. I have to do hard labor and my wife has to have hard labor when giving birth. I decided to just collect disability and my wife and I adopted a child so we avoided the consequence of original sin. Which is okay, is was this type of innovative thinking that got Adam and Eve off in this direction in the first place. Posted by David Flannery at 10:22 AM 8

 The Grim Reaper and Other Play Dates 
 I was wondering why we call the Grim Reaper grim. Isn’t the passing into the next life suppose to be wondrous and happy? The idea of a grim, boney, faceless, hooded soul with a sickle does hold some appeal to me, however. He wouldn’t have to say,
“Come with me, you know what you have done”,
I would go without being asked, dragged or sickled . I never believed I deserved Heaven, in fact I have felt just the opposite.

If there were real justice, we would all be in Hell, at least if only for a good spanking. That is me judging so you can see just one of the reasons why I would be going. I just think with the whole energy crisis that Hell and it’s eternal flames must be rather expensive to run and even Satan must dread the monthly heating bill. Same goes for Heaven, the constant temperature of perfection must be a bill that has God even wondering why he opened the gates or least wondering why he didn’t insulate. It is not that I think most people are bad I just never believed in eternal reward or punishment. Forty years with me has, at times, felt like an eternity….I am not sure I want to experience me forever

Grim ( as his friends? call him) has many souls to pick up if my math is correct. Which could only mean that there were more than one of them. Maybe one is really large and not all bones like in the pictures. I am not sure how I would feel if I answered the door, however, and saw that death had been eating better than me. It could be that the Grim that comes for you is the opposite of you. I may have a munchkin Grim that hangs onto my belt as he takes me away.
“Not so fun being tall today, is it”? steams from his hood as we get into a mini couper. I think if Hell where Hell, however, he would show up and just start the tease.
“I’m not hear for you today, I was just checking the address”. This way you could stew in what you had done and prepare yourself for the constant torment that lay ahead. I am sure that when Grim came for Hitler, the other Grims had to pull overtime. They all came. No since letting such a prize get away with a last minute profession of Christ and what better story to tell the little Grims than the day you harvested more than hops from Germany.

Like with all dead end jobs, I would think Grim would need time off like the rest of us. We all spend our down time a little different and this would be no exception. Since we always sit around and worry about death, does he sit around worrying about life? I would imagine in his spare time, he wouldn’t interact well with others. I don’t imagine that any of his neighbors would borrow tools and not return them. Can you imagine holding onto a drill and having death come knocking on your door? I could see Grim stopping by if I committed a murder but for borrowing a screwdriver? Play dates for his children would be a problem. I mean few people would want to refuse but when Grim says he will back at 6pm, you would not be inclined to answer the door. And what if his child gets unruly while he is gone? How do you discipline the Grim Reaper’s child? I can’t imagine‘time out’being very effective to an eternal spirit.

I would imagine that the Grim house is pretty quite. He does not receive any mail, visitors and is on the do not call list. I have never seen his name listed in either the white or yellow pages. I think telemarketers have a tough job. The day your number rotation has you call the house of death may not be the sale you want.
“Yes”Grim says,“I will take everything you have. When can you come over and deliver everything?”

Since virtually everybody who has a job, answers to someone, I wonder who Grim answers to. Does he get monthly or yearly reviews? Is he called out on the carpet when he makes a mistake? And what would his punishment be? How do you reprimand death? It would be easy to think that Satan was his boss but I don’t think the after life, other than having your flesh ripped off every day, is much different than the world of the living. There must be miles of middle managers always coming up with new ideas. The paper work would be endless, especially since they could care less if they kill trees. A performance review may look like this.
“Sit down Grim, take a load off. Have you lost weight?”
“I always liked your wit sir, why have you called me into your office?”
“The Madison pick-up. According to the logs, you were there over an hour”
“She seemed too happy and she had just made dinner. It was like she was expecting me”
“The wise are always expecting you”
“Anyway, we talked and she didn’t seem like such a bad soul. I didn’t really want to take her”
“It is not up to us Grim. We don’t make the rules. I am the first to say I hate being a company man but I have a family to think of…. So leave your thoughts at home and give me some of those numbers I am use to….”
“Yes sir‘Grim replies.


I always imagined that it would end something like this for me. I would hear the doorbell ring and I would jump up with excitement for my hot steaming pizza. I fling the door open and there is Grim, he just shrugs.
I hear my wife yell from the kitchen,
“See, I told you that pizza would kill you!”
She would, as always, get the last word in.
My only hope and fantasy is that Grim is so busy that he has had to speed up his work by wearing roller blades. I don’t think this is unreasonable since there are more people to pick up and even death has to be time conscious. I think there should be a little levity if I am going to Hell for eternal punishment. I would have to wear roller blades too, just to keep up with him and since I have never been able to stop properly, or at all on those things, I am just hoping I ride right past Hell to the other side.

 Aliens In Our Mist 
 Did you ever wonder why aliens from outerapace always appear in a white mist with bright lights shining everywhere as they try to scramble through whatever underbrush our 4 billion year old planet can muster? According to Hollywood, even when no one is around, the landed spaceship has vast amounts of steam shrilling from every opening, creating the mist just in case the upcoming abduction isn&apos;t in the north coast of California&apos;s everday fog. After leaving their ship, where ever they go, to a house or to a barn, there is always steam, it just follows them. Apparently faster than light travel cause a lot of friction so the steam just oozes off of them, which obviously burns all their hair off. They are always bald. Maybe with four fingers they can do almost anything except create Rogaine.
My conclusion is that the ability to travel beyond light speeds somehow requires the use of steam engines. All this effort we have devoted to coming up with warp drives and particle accelerators and we have had the answer since the 1800’s. We didn’t know this on the Apollo missions. We didn’t see this steam on the moon landing because we only reached speeds of 25,000 miles an hour, a snail’s pace.

And the lights. It is always like a bad Broadway play (Like there is such a thing). A blind person could find their way around these ships. They can travel across the universe but can’t see 15 feet in front of their space ship without flood lights. They seem capable of traveling across galaxies with unbelievable methods of direction and engineering but, once they enter Earth&apos;s sky, every color of the rainbow has to radiate from their ship. And what makes that important is that the aliens are always portrayed as having eyes the size of bananas, ( 2 week old black bananas). They could gather enough light in those large orbs to see in a lightless cave yet; they always leave the lights on. Apparently one of the side effects of hyper space travel is boundless energy and the desire to leave the lights on. If their goal is to remain hidden, it is like robbing a bank and trying to go unnoticed by wrapping sets of Christmas lights around every part of your body then hiding in a nearby bush. One advancement I would like to learn from them is that that I have never heard of a witness catching an alien on a ladder changing a bulb. They have figured that one out.

If you have never heard of or experienced a night terror you are missing one of nature’s real treats. You partially wake but can’t move a muscle and the whole time you are convinced there is something in the room that wants to hurt you. There is nothing worse. I have had it happen three times in my life. They are as old as time and besides the invention of distilled spirits; it is where the idea of Alien abductions originated. I let people off the hook if they are not familiar with night terrors. But after that explanation is exhausted and the person goes on to tell about populating other planets, there is only one explanation. The person’s IQ has not boiled over a 100. The proof of this is staggering. Let’s take a look at who has never been abducted. No Nobel Prize winning scientists, No Professional athletes, No Heads of States, No Fashion models ( okay not a good example), No Pulitzer Prize winning authors and to my knowledge, no one with breast implants. Which might be proof alone since you would think the little green men would want to figure out why women do this. If I were going to study humans, this would be my study group, especially if I was going to pull out instruments and probes.

What about the archeological evidence, like carved landscapes of animals or apparent landing strips only identifiable from the air? If I were on a deserted island, I am sure that all of my work would be aimed at attracting the attention of something in the air. It is likely that my carved message of &quot;Dear God, save me…I can’t eat another coconut!&quot; would be so large that a satellite could see it. The pyramids are not a mystery to me. They are made out of square blocks put one on top of another.
“How did they get there?&quot; They carried them.
&quot;How?&quot; One at a time, I don&apos;t care.
I mean it is amazing and cool but much like my grandmother’s cooking. The very fact that she has ruined the Turkey dinner every Thanksgiving for 25 years is unexplainable, but not unworldly.

What about eye witness testimony? Many people will talk about eye witness testimony from credible witnesses. The problem is, there is no such thing. Study after study has shown that no one is a credible eye witness. There has been research that had people watching tapes of other people interacting and then the scientist introduces a gorilla suited man that walks across the screen for 9 seconds and during the post interview, no one has seen it or has any memory of the gorilla. For years I would tell my parents that I had gotten home before midnight and they always said,
“Well, I didn&apos;t see you!”&quot;
Can&apos;t rely on eye witnesses!&quot; , I would remind them.
Remember the thief with the Christmas lights? Maybe not such a bad disguise if there are hordes of people around.

What about the photographs? Well the fact that almost all of them turn out to be either hoaxes or explainable just means that the remaining small percentages are probably in the same category. My family and I look at pictures that are 30 years old and we can&apos;t figure who most of the people are. Always some neighbor kid or some relative we forgot about. Pictures are rarely what they appear to be. I was once shown a picture of me with small farm animals. I was able to show it was only a matter of lighting and reflections. My one friend argues that there are no pictures of him having sex but that does not mean he has not had boat loads. In his case I think it does. There is a website that professionals use to turn in atmospheric photographs and every month, they have a picture of something that has never been captured before, but always explainable. They are bizarre and amazing but they are all from this bizarre and amazing planet. You would think that after a 100 year of photographs, there would be at least one really good one of a spaceship. Politicians are surely hiding their sexual behavior just as much as the aliens are hiding their spaceships but we seem to get weekly graphic updates of the politicians. There is never a blurry dot in a photograph that someone points to and says“That’s Bill Clinton”

There is an old saying. There is definitely life elsewhere in the universe. The proof of this is that it has chosen not to come here. Hold on everyone, we are going to be alone for a long long time.

 Sharks, Whales and Where is My Foot ? 
 It is often said they you can experience hell on earth. When I was 14 years old, I went to see Jaws on the Friday night it opened. In that same summer my mother had been granted use of her employer’s condo in Ft. Lauderdale for one week. We arrived one day after my dreams of being an oceanographer were dashed by the wailing and gnashing of teeth. I don’t think Hell should be forever, but it would not bother me a bit if Steven Spielberg (The director of Jaws) and Peter Benchley (the author of Jaws) were assigned to a carnival with a dunk tank full of sharks, for at least a 100 years. We would all get to throw copies of the book and old VHS tapes at the bulls-eye.

To this day I still cannot imagine anything more terrifying than that first day in the water. There is nothing else to do on that stretch of beach but go in the water, especially when it is 95 degrees in the shade. As soon as my toes hit the ocean, all I heard was the theme song from the movie beating through my bones. I was convinced that I would be chewed and thrown around like a dog&apos;s rope toy. I prayed the sharks would find a skinny, pimply, white perogie looking teenager as unattractive as the girls in my 8th grade. This torture when on for days. It climbed to its peak when a swimmer a mile from us was bitten on the leg by a shark and nearly bled out. He was in the hospital and I was in Hell. It was like meeting the demons in the flaming pit as they handed out pitchforks while asking... &quot;Would you like your pitch fork super-sized?&quot; The water is not clear in Ft. Lauderdale and like the bullet you don’t hear coming, a shark can leisurely swim to you. That experience was so scarring that, to this day, I feel I only narrowly avoided my destiny of being eaten. I still think that is how I am going to leave this earth. This is not a phobia; this is a vision of the future.

It has colored my humor and world view ever since.
I have always imagined the Titanic sinking, the people in the freezing water, the cracking sounds, and the band that continued to play. I can see two sharks bobbing with their heads above the water and the one says to the other“Hey listen, they’re playing our song!”I imagine that several different species of sharks fed on cold cuts for days. Now don’t get all hot and bothered. The sinking took place 100 years ago; it is about time it is opened for humor. I am not writing about Columbine or the World Trade Center for heaven&apos;s sake. I still have never been able to come up with a Lincoln or Kennedy joke either, so for those sensitive ones out there, we have reached the high water mark.

I have always loved whales, killer whales in particular. Now what a bummer of a name. I mean we all kill something when we eat. Every one of us and everything that is alive so how they got to grab the title of killer, I am not sure. I always imagined a father killer whale teaching his little one about hunting.“Now, remember son, if the seal is broke, don’t open it”. I am always surprised when these beautiful beasties don’t eat their trainers at Sea Parks. I would eat anyone that kept me in a cement prison, whether I was hungry or not. I think it is horrible when a trainer gets hurt or killed. I have no doubt that they love these animals and always want them to be treated extremely well. I am just never surprised is all, I don’t think anyone is.
I don’t know if you believe in evolution or not and it really doesn’t matter to me if you do but, let me suggest this…The mammals that took to the water had a pretty good idea of what was coming. They saw the future of the naked ape that would run around with spears and wipe out every animal it could. They took to the water as a formal retreat and were not too anxious to look back to shore. The penguins went to Antarctica to get away. They even traded in their wings so on impulse they would not fly back. I am sure the invention of the diesel engine was a sad day for the entire ocean. What we have heard for the last 40 years as wonderful whale songs, which can travel thousands of miles, are actually nothing more than cries of mourning. It is a sad memory song of a peaceful life that is being taken away by books, movies and ignorance. Blessed are those that mourn.

As many of you know, this was written months before I was bitten recently. The reason I am re-posting it is because I was bit a 1/2 mile from the beach I stood at as a kid. To say that my skin was white and reflecting all known star light would be an understatement.  My cockiness to me to swim among bate fish and a pier where they float chum buckets to attract fish. I must have tasted like a McDonald&apos;s fish fillet because I was spit out as soon as I crossed the sharks taste buds and before I knew what hit me. And that is the lesson. we are not their food and they are not meant to be ours.

I did not report the bite because there are no life guards and I would never give the media something to say bad about sharks. I got too drunk to even go to the hospital till the next day and the doctors are not required to report ocean bites. They do have to report if a person or a dog bites you, but that is for another blog. The 8 stitches from the bite are out and I still go into the water each week...one can not put off your destiny forever...

 No One Gets Out Of Here Alive 
 No one goes to a health clinic in the hopes of meeting someone. You certainly don’t think about finding a new friend while you are in the STD line. You don’t stand for food stamps if you can afford to put something on your table and you don’t stand in the HIV express lane if you are behaving sexually. All right, let’s get this out of the way. Sex is cool and great, heck every thing that has ever lived has done it (or tried)…It is right up there with eating, a necessity. Should you do it only if you are married? Who knows such things? I do know that married men and women sleep around in numbers that would shock you. I know of one person who has stayed faithful for 30 years and he is the angriest man I know. That is just my experience.

I went to the clinic because I was asked to go. No, I didn’t get the dreaded phone call from the County Health Service representative saying that someone that was infected had turned in my name. That would have implied that I actually had had sex. And that would be real humor. Instead, I was actually trying to be responsible and before the next time I did engage, I would know that I was safe. Like a pitcher warming up in the 5th inning, I thought I was soon going to get in the game.

The problem was I came with the girl I was thinking of sleeping with. We were holding hands as we were waiting to be called. We had gotten there at 8 am, we were the first appointments. It is great to feel like a priority at an STD Clinic. Since anonymity is paramount and is even the law, I was given the secret code of # 1 and my new friend was # 2. We sat behind a really attractive woman, who was # 3.
My clinic date said“Wow, she has really pretty hair.”I was not looking or trying to notice anyone, I already felt like I was at the prom with my mother…but hey, she brought it to my attention, so I added“And Legs”. What does it say to the other clients when you get elbowed in the main waiting room? It looked like we had just been handed our results and it was entirely my fault.

“Number One, can you please follow me?’Nothing fits my ego better than this label. I was led into a poorly lit room. I sat with a counselor and he asked me about my sex life.
“That is a little personal, don’t you think?”I asked him.
“I am only here to help”He deadpanned.
“Really...Could you give me some numbers of loose women?”
He said nothing. If girls knew how we men thought, they would never speak to us. Then he said,“You know, with express, you can find out your results in 30 minutes, but you are down for the full examination, which will take 2 weeks.“
“I haven’t had sex in 16 months, what is 2 weeks?”I lied, 2 weeks would seem like the same amount of time it would take Pluto to orbit the Sun. He finished my history and apparently came to the same conclusion as the initial intake, express service was not for me. He initialed that I was to give every possible sample, including a brain sample.
“Does the brain sample hurt?’I asked.
“Normally, but it is pretty clear you haven’t been using yours, you’ll be fine”

I was first asked to sit in the‘we will need you to urinate section’all by myself. This is cool since most men have trouble urinating when others are around anyway.
“Number 1 ? Is Number 1 here ? I need Number 1&apos;s blood”, A small Vietnamese woman asked. I looked to my left and right. I was still the only one in the room.
“I am Number 1, but I thought I was supposed to go #1 before the blood letting occurred?
“You do number 1 second, first we take blood”she said. I just shook my head and followed her into a morgue like hallway. It was freezing.
‘Why is it so cold in here?”I asked.
“Keeps the germs down”she said.
“I guess that’s why no on gets sick in Canada”I chuckled and continued.
“Do you use needles or leeches to get the blood?”She gave that grinned shut up look. She needed to confirm who I was before she put my blood in a vial.
&quot;Your name?”
“I am the One”
“Yes I know, but what is your real name?”
“Bernie, its Bernie Home. But who is number One?&quot; I asked.
“You are”she smiled. I was finally being appreciated.
She swabbed my arm with alcohol, which takes 10 minutes to kill the germs but the needle was in within seconds.

I was then asked to go a different waiting room . I was again alone until the cute #3 with the pretty hair and legs came by. She waved like a cheerleader. I waved back less enthusiastically. I then was asked to go into another room with a dark skinned older woman.
“I am going to check you for everything”she said.
“Why, do I have that look on my face?”She just pointed to a chair.
“First I will check for moles, since we live in Florida and then I will check your scrotum.”I had never heard moles and scrotum used in the same sentence. My moles checked out and she asked me to drop my pants. I felt like a crack whore as my shorts wrapped around my ankles. She said I should check my testicles at least once a month for growths.“Honey, I have not left them alone since I was 12”. I didn’t care what I said at this point, I was trying to deflect my uncomfortableness with humor. She then pulled out a Q-tip as long as an elephant’s trunk.
“What is that for?”I winced.
“I have to check for chlamydia and gonorrhea by putting this inside your urethra.”
“Urethra? Didn’t they just play in the World Cup?”, I yelped. I knew she meant my penis but I have never considered it as having an orifice and yes, I took anatomy.
“I would rather you check my prostrate!”
“That I will check next but this will take just a second&quot;
“A minute?”I cried. &quot;Time just stopped for me!”
This is where the phrase, I wouldn&apos;t touch you with a 10 foot pole comes from. This q-tip was obviously left over from the Nazi’s. This was just unbelievable.
“All guys have this done, don’t worry”she added
“No they don’t!&quot; I yelled. &quot;I would have heard about this, that I am sure!”
In her next minute, I nearly blacked out and I called for my mother at least 3 times. I was never going to have sex again.
&quot;Time for prostrate&quot; She smiled.
Then I heard the plastic glove slap on. Then I heard another one snap on. I whipped around. She was grinning with both hands covered in gloves.

&quot; Why two gloves?&quot; I shrilled. &quot; Are you going spelunking?&quot;
&quot;You very funny!&quot; She said. I called for my mother one last time.

I was back in a third waiting room, fairly sure I had left some part of my manhood in that small torture cell. My clinic date joined me and asked“How is it going?’
“How is it going?”I said with the look of death.“I envy pin cushions right now. I am thinking that a 2 week stay in 1940&apos;s Dachau would be a relief..and those gorgeous breasts of yours…I wouldn’t touch them with a 10 foot pole! No offense!”
I got up to pay my bill and walk away. While I was in line waiting to pull out my wallet, number 3 danced behind me with a bubbly smile.
“Hey”she said.
“Hey?“I asked.
“Do you want my number?”she smiled.

&quot;That&apos;s okay&quot; I said. &quot;I think I already know your number.&quot;

 I Burned a Eulogy Log at Christmas 
 I have been running on the beach everyday for about 2 months. This does not qualify me for a torch carry in the next Olympics or even, sadly, a smaller shirt. I have not lost a single pound. I realize that I am in my 40’s and my youthful metabolism is somewhere in a basement box with all of my high school yearbooks but there has to be some other explanation. I do take some solace that I have stopped the continual weight gain that was adding on of a pound each week since Christmas dinner. I have now reached stasis, that elusive state in nature that is not supposed to even exist. I have become like a laundry mat’s change machine. I have the same amount going in as going out. Buying more change machines does not result in more profits and I suspect that more exercise would only result in more eating. My male friends tell me I am not losing weight because I am adding muscle. I asked why I needed more muscle…they said“to carry all of that fat.”

Adding literal injury to insult, I pulled my calf muscle while running the other morning. This muscle is the size of New Jersey so this had no small effect. I am sure it would have gotten better but I iced it down so heavily that I got freezer burns that made walking even more difficult. I could not bare not exercising, however, so even after the burns had become open wounds, I continued to go for an ocean swim every day. I thought the salt water and sun would help heal it, not really paying attention to the fact that each outing attracted every carnivorous animal within 2 miles. The smaller, unseen animals won and now I have an infection. My 3 lb brain continues to hate me. Don’t ever let a religious person tell you that we have dominion on this planet, because we don’t. The world belongs to micro organisms; we are their guests, not their hosts.

So I have stopped swimming and frankly moving at any level of grace. Everybody has an opinion about running in the sand. It is either the best thing for you or it is the worst. I want to throw in the“We put a man on the moon but we can’t figure how to run properly”but, that is over used and frankly, they didn’t run so well when they were on the moon. I barely get around without a cane so that gives everyone the ammunition to say I told you so. Scientists have not figured out what type of shoe is best for running or whether shoes even help. I just watched a documentary and now it looks that running barefoot is the best method. Wow, I am stunned by the research. I expect that next month breast feeding will be given the seal of approval. Couch potatoes and intellectuals unite; you all continue to be idiots.

What makes it all worse is that I am suddenly feeling vulnerable and gimpy. Is this it? Is this the injury that propels me to hypertension and slurred speech? It feels like the end. It is as if I was on the top of a large amusement park slide to old age and I had been pushed off while I was not looking. If I was an Eskimo, my daughter would point out the front door to the barren tundra, sending the old man out to freeze.

And then on cue, a young salesman called me and wanted to know if I had made final plans for when I died. Unbelievable. I told him that I did not plan on dying, at least not in the traditional sense.
“Well, have you made plans, Mr. Bernie?”He used my name and called me Mr.; I was in worse shape than I thought.
“Yes, I have made final plans. I plan to die as the King of England with plenty of women, who really don’t like me, giving me a final sponge bath”. He was silent, he knew I was lying.
“Okay, actually, I plan on being eaten by a shark. And before you say anything, I am serious.”I added.
“If I was going to be eaten by a shark”He jumped in.“I would want our silver package. It would cover you completely if such an accident would occur.“
“Cover me with what, a police blanket to keep away the crabs?“I said.“And besides, I it would not be an accident, it is my destiny”
“Better yet”he explained further“death should never be unexpected or unplanned and our gold plan is just the ticket. It is for those deaths that were not surprises”
I told him a better plan would be one that kept me out of the water but I mentioned I rarely controlled such impulses.
“Perfect!&quot; He nearly screamed.“You need our Premier Package. It not only covers the expected and the unexpected but provides a great service for all of your friends and family so they can make the transition”
“Why?&quot; I asked,“Are they going with me? And if they are it sounds a little bit like Hell. I am not sure I should have to pay for that”
He continued,“After your guests reflect and listen to the songs you have pre-selected, you could have one of your best chums,”He quickly corrected himself,“I’m sorry, one of your best friends give the eulogy.&quot;

I could just see my best friend doing my eulogy.
“Here lies Bernie…and here and here”as pointed to several Tupperware containers surrounded by pictures.
“Let’s call it like it is, the one thing I will miss about Bernie is his laugh. The one thing I won’t miss about him was his constant chattering on how he was going to be eaten by a shark. The bloke was right but if you are going to be dead on, so to speak, why not channel that prophetic gift into picking the next Microsoft or knowing which girl you were meant to spend your life with? He was more of a clairvoyant than Nostradamus and as ill fated as the Edzel.”Then they he would have to read something I had prepared.
“But I can say that he did not become someone different than what he wanted to be. And whether we can love him and agree, all he ever wanted was to love those around him and to be eaten in the sea”
I wrote the last part to make sure my best bud was remembered for reading ridiculous rhymes at my wake. I figure if I am being laid to rest, I don’t want anyone getting laid for fun.

One good thing about being dead is you don’t get to see who shows up at your funeral. Can you imagine? The people you swore would come, don’t and the people whose first names you forgot 10 times, show up, like the Korean store owner who I bought cigarettes from. He tells my family,
“He always greets me with a wonderful yellow stained smile. I will miss him. He always had correct change”
Ahhh, the warmth my family would feel. The real agony of death is when that one true beauty that you were always afraid to approach shows up in a black veil.
“If only he would have asked me out, I am sure I could have kept him out of the water”

I never saw that one coming.

 Like Sand Through The Hour Glass 
 I was running on the beach this morning and I felt like I was in the movie,“Honey, I shrunk the kids”. It felt like I had been reduced to a size where I was running in an ashtray. It is staggering what is left in the sand and what washes ashore after a human weekend. I read that 10% of all plastic ends up in the ocean. South Florida has so many surgerically augmented people; I keep expecting to come out some morning and see lips lapping in the waves or left over breast implants forming the keystones for sandcastles.

I ran by a guy lying next to a large sand castle with a huge sign that said“WILL BUILD TO SUIT”. The castle had windows, turrets and a deep moat. Since he drinks beer all day, I was afraid to ask him how he keeps the moat full. He told me that he had gotten tired of the hustle and bustle of the building trades. He couldn’t suppress his desire to build, drink beer and stare at women, however, so he saw this new opportunity as a way to combine all of his passions. I asked how business was and he said that he had not made a dime, although several couples (mostly children) had shown interest in his spec home. He crushed another beer can and said the main reason he loved the beach was the women. He added that since most of them were already lying on their backs, most his preliminary work had been done.

The entire state of Florida is sand. Digging a whole in your back yard can be done with your hands. Dogs, Pirates and Serial killers love it here. I am still trying to figure out how tall buildings stand and how Miami doesn&apos;t look like a thousand leaning towers of Pisa. I keep expecting to wake one morning with all of my furniture piled against one wall and part of my body hanging out the window. (Not real likely since true Floridians never open a window). It is a good thing we don’t get Earthquakes because we would all be below sea level with a few shakes. Some scholar will offer that all the sand was created from billions of years of decayed sea life, (which means the first beaches had no sand?). Others will tell you that it is millions of years of erosion from rocks and mountains. These two theories may be true but let me introduce two lesser known scientific ideas. First, we have to consider all of the people that use to have hour glass figures that have retired to Florida. (Heaven’s waiting room, my friend calls it.) We all know what happens to an hour glass as time goes by…the sand settles on the bottom and given enough time, it leaks and spills out, hence the ever enlarging beaches. Secondly, It is said that Moses came down from the mountain holding tablets with instructions for his people. It is pretty clear to everyone that two tablets, with 10 commandments, were not going to be nearly enough. I venture to say that he was given a 100 tablets but he kept dropping them on his way down the mountain. He was too embarrassed to mention this to God since neither of them made backups, so he just kept walking and finally made it to the base of the mountain with just two. The rest well, turned into sand.

My local life guard will not tell you were he thinks the sand comes from, at least not while Baywatch is on. He only offers how often he sees a shark swim in from the reef. He claims in the last 15 years there have not been so much as a nibble, let alone a shark bite. I keep this mind every time I get in the water. I figure if it has been 15 years, so the sharks must really be hungry by now. I know sharks like their meals to be served raw and since I am always slightly red from sunburn, my medium rare buttocks must be a turn off.

The most interesting part about living on the beach is that almost no body can see it. The view from virtually everywhere is blocked by large buildings as if a drunken city planner dropped all of his legos near the water. You have to actually stand on the beach to see the ocean and even then you have to know the secret roads and paths that get you there. This is probably why so many people who can’t wear clothes well, feel at ease taking them off at the water. No one is going to see them except other Atkins members and the indigenous sea life.

I often wonder what my dolphin friend thinks when he pops his head out of the water and sees the squash of barely clothed humanity and what we have done to the shore line. He is much smarter than we are. Dolphins don’t kill each other or pollute their world so they are at Mensa level as far as I am concerned. A dolphin&apos;s echo location organs are so sophisticated they can see a person’s heart and all of their internal organs. This is why I take all of my dates on a dip in the ocean. The next morning when I meet my Cetacean friend for our daily swim, he gives me the low down. After a few clicks and a few mackerel, I find out“what she is made of”. He knows where the sand comes from and he knows how to stop the oil spill in the Gulf, but he lets us make our own mistakes. After our chat, he is always joined by his friends. He then clicks good bye and heads out to the deep, away from people. You know you are smart if you know where to spend your free time and you never had to evolve hands or feet.

 On a Blind Date, She Dropped Money in My Cup 
 So I went on my first date in over a year. I was not looking to date; at least I was in no hurry. I had just settled into a new place and I actually decided to go back to work (a clear attempt at trying to fit in). I had always imagined leaving Florida, ever since I had gotten here actually. Problem was, no other state wanted me so I finally determined to settle, even after several hurricanes and 4 hot summers (Africa Hot Summers…even camels won’t live here)

Months ago, I put my profile on match.com but I would not pay the $30 dollars. I am not sure what I was expecting, I could not read or send an email…All I could do was look at pictures, much like I did when I was a young lad with my mother’s department store catalogs. I grew up with the Macy’s bra section. But, as fate would have it, I was at work on Friday and I didn’t lose my normal millions; I actually showed a profit for the week so I joined. Now,$30 dollars later, I was expecting big things.

I responded to several of the emails that had been in my box. The very next day, I asked a woman from my neighborhood to meet me for coffee. She agreed but first had to pick up a shower door at Home Depot before meeting me at Starbucks. She called a few minutes later and wanted to know in which direction I was coming from. Since I live on the beach, I wanted to be a smart ass and say from the west….I was going to circle the earth and then meet her, but I held my tongue. I showed proper dating decorum and said I would be coming from the East. I knew she wanted help with her door. I had put in my profile that I was handy, that I could fix or build anything and this girl was not wasting anytime. I had a feeling that once I put the door in, I would be tiling the kitchen and I don’t get on my knees for anyone.

I got to the coffee shop first and waited for a small car to show up. She mentioned that she could barely drive with the new shower door, so I was not expecting a limo. I had seen her pictures so I had an idea what to expect. She did mention that since I gave her such short notice that her hair would be in a pony tail. I am kind of partial to pony tails except when they are on men. There should be open season on men with pony tails. You should be allowed to sneak up and cut them off. I always imagined my den walls covered with all my trophy pony tails. Okay, back to the story, I saw a small car pull up and a girl with a pony tail jumped out. She had a baseball hat pulled far down her face and she walked into the shop. She stood in the middle of the lobby and looked right at me and turned around and left. Damn, I thought, I should probably post older pictures or at the very least, never meet during the day. I couldn’t believe that I would have misjudged her to that extent. I figured if she didn’t like the way I looked she would have at least sat down and made an effort to get me to fix her car engine.

About 5 minutes later, the right person walked in. Pony tail and no hat. She had said she was 43. I will soon be 49 so I was a little suspect on her stated age but for the time being, I was happy she had her teeth and all of her hair. I am sure she was sizing me up too. I could tell that she was looking at my hairline, to see if there was a seam...

We talked and laughed. I was at total ease. I felt I could be myself. Of course, I was not going to bring up my numerous arrests or jail time. Heck, what were 2nd dates for? I had a long sleeve shirt on so she could not see my‘Bubba’tattoo. We continued chatting for an hour and at some point she told me that her sister’s had signed her up for match and they put the wrong age in her profile. I am thinking that she did not come from a very close family since even her family did not know her age. It may also have implied that her siblings were tired of her showing up every weekend and thought if they found her a boyfriend she would be too busy to eat all of their food. Anyway, she confessed that she was going to be 51 soon and she blamed her sisters. I told her that is was really her mother’s fault for her upcoming birthday. I asked her if there was anything else I should know, genital herpes, sex change or dead husbands? But I, again, held my tongue. I did ask her why she didn’t change her profile age, since it can be done with a click. She seemed surprised that she could do this.

This led to us talking about people&apos;s profiles on the site. I said that someone must write all of the women’s profiles then they hand them out, because they all read the same... &quot; looking for a sincere, honest, humorous, sensitive...&quot; ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz. She was surprised to hear this too. She asked me to read hers and since I am a writer, she wanted me to liven hers up, or at least make suggestions on how to improve it. Until then, I thought the date was going well. I was not being asked to fix her car but I was being asked to make her more attractive to other guys. So I redid her profile. I put in all the secret comments that make men run. And as she drove off, I thought I heard her car sputter...
