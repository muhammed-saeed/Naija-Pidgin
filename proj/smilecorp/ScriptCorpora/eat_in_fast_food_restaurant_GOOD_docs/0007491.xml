 Pretty Good 
 OpenTable Diner Since Dined on 07/07/2012 2012 Dined on 07/07/2012 2012 Food (Good) 3 / 5 Service (Outstanding) 5 / 5 Ambiance (Good) 3 / 5 Noise Level Moderate &quot; The food quality was from average to pretty good. Our tuna appetizer was not good at all. It had a&quot;funky&quot;taste to it. Even though we didn&apos;t complain, it was apparent that we did not care for it by the amount of Tuna left on the plate. The mussels were good. Our main courses were right on target. My girlfriend had the Chillean Sea Bass and I had the lobster tail. Dessert was amazing. &quot; Dined on 07/07/2012 2012 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you! You have successfully submitted a comment for this review.

The waitress was very rude, never checked on us, forgot a extra side we ordered for my son(which she never brought),the food was also pretty bad my fish was like hard plastic on the side, it was even hard to cut through. She messed up our bill and added that side to your bill didn&apos;t even appoligize and just took it out of my hand and actually tossed the bill back on our table once she fixed it. Once we paid she didn&apos;t even say thanks for coming or anything she just put the card and reciept on the table and walked away. &quot; Dined on 06/15/2012 2010 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

Now I would except at such a restaurant to get real chips such as you would get at a british place. Instead I was served what you would get at a fast food place. On top of that the fries seem to have been under the heat lamp for the entire day. I informed our server&amp;the got a cold would you like me to bring you some fresh ones? Why serve it in the first place. Then when she did I got the same fries.
After that the biggest disappointment was the fact that no ones came to inquire what was wrong or even apologize.
after $151the of a tab I think I would say go to a real place next time. &quot; Dined on 06/16/2012 2012 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

The Shanghai preparation is divine, I&apos;ve had it on both the salmon and the sea bass. The oysters are great too, they always taste really fresh. Desserts here are delicious but insanely big. It took me three days to finish the slab of carrot cake! &quot; Dined on 06/11/2012 2011 Special Features: fit for foodies , special occasion Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

Our meal at the Tampa location was perfect and in tradition with the standards he sets for all locations. Wait staff were attentive and full of excellent advise on the daily menu. Our kudos to the staff for a meal well prepared and presented. Hint to those who may have an anniversary or special events....This location has excellent private rooms for groups and booths for couples and special events. Take time to review on-line and make advance reservations for special seating requests. &quot; Dined on 06/11/2012 2012 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

Our waitress was awesome, knowledgeable and very courteous at all times and even gave recommendations on some of the menu items. The food came out and it was absolutely delicious. My girlfriend said the the Chilean Sea Bass and lobster bisque was the best she ever had. I had the Prime Ribeye and it was excellent as well. We will definitely be going back to Mitchell&apos;s in the future and will be recommending it to all our friends and family.

Blackened salmon was not up to usual high standards. Perhaps it was because we were having a late lunch and the A team was not in the kitchen. Service was quite good. &quot; Dined on 06/02/2012 2007 Special Features: fit for foodies , neighborhood gem , great for lunch Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

 Not worth the money 
 OpenTable Diner Since Dined on 05/26/2012 2012 Dined on 05/26/2012 2012 Food (Fair) 2 / 5 Service (Outstanding) 5 / 5 Ambiance (Very Good) 4 / 5 Noise Level Energetic &quot; Service was excellent but after that the food was fair at best. Scallops had no flavor but were cooked right. Green beans were undercooked. Smashed potatoes were good. Clam chowder was good. Macadamia crusted pecan pie was overly sweet. So overall I&apos;d give this restaurant a 3 or fair. Definitely not worth the price charged. The bottle of wine we had was priced $7.00 higher than PF Changs which was next door to this restaurant. Overpriced.
Sorry but I&apos;m a believer of telling it the way it is and this is the concensus of each of the 3 of us that had dinner. &quot; Dined on 05/26/2012 2012 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

 In need of Attention 
 OpenTable Diner Since Dined on 05/25/2012 2007 Dined on 05/25/2012 2007 Food (Good) 3 / 5 Service (Fair) 2 / 5 Ambiance (Very Good) 4 / 5 Noise Level Moderate &quot; I had been curious about this restaurant for a long time. I expected it would be something extra special, but it was not. I was there on a Friday evening and expected the restaurant would be busy, but it was not. I probably ordered the wrong thing. I ordered the fried fish and shrimp plate. The breading on the fish and shrimp was way overdone. The clam chowder I ordered as a starter was quite good. Even though the service was quick ( my meal arrived before I finished the soup), the server never offered me any bread, which I saw at other tables and never offered to refill my soft drink. I think that&quot;solo&quot;diners tend to get ignored, and this place was no exception. &quot; Dined on 05/25/2012 2007 Special Features: good for groups Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

She happily removed them when we prompted her to do so.
Although one would call this an up-scale restaurant, it was both surprising and somewhat puzzling that no tablecloths were used. A simple white tablecloth would have been appropriate and appreciated.
The food - there were five of us, all adults over 50 years of age - was uniformly outstanding, from the ribeye to the lobster.
This was our second dining experience at Mitchell&apos;s, and we were pleased with both visits. &quot; Dined on 05/21/2012 2010 Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!

Solid choice with great gumbo and very good double chocolate cake. Shrimp and scallops were above average and the smashed red potatoes and carrots were excellent. I had the blackened Amberjack and Caesar Salad. Salad was above average, but the Amberjack was just OK. Service was attentive and knowledgeable.

 Freaking Fabulous

I am not a huge seafood fan but my co-workers are so I went with them figuring I would settle for something sub-par off the bottom of the menu. What I got was a parmesean chicken dish that was better than any I&apos;ve had in my past!! How awesome is that? The rest of my group raved about the seafood and we all of course loved our appetizers! I highly recommend the Crab, Artichoke and Spinich dip. Lastly, and I dare you to pass up this, the Shark Fin pie. I&apos;m not going to spoil it for you but I will tell you it is an unforgettable experience! &quot; Dined on 05/07/2012 2012 Special Features: good for groups , great for outdoor dining , notable wine list , special occasion Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful.

There was a mess up with putting our order in and only half of it made it back to the kitchen (computer glitch). Half our meals came out only five minutes later than the other half but they apologized profusely and comped those meals plus a to go order that we made, and offered free desert but we were too stuffed for that. Besides that, the meal was amazing. The gumbo I had was so good, and the lobster tails melted in your mouth. &quot; Dined on 05/04/2012 2012 Special Features: good for groups Share: 0 points 0 of 0 voted this as helpful. Thank you!
