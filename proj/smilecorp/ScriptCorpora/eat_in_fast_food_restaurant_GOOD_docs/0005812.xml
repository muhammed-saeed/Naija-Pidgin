Let’s Hike Big Shoals to Little Shoals, along the Suwanee River! This is a great hike, one of my favorites.

We will hike out from the Big Shoals State Park parking area and hike along the river to the Little Shoals Parking area. We will meetup at the Big Shoals State Park parking area at 9am on Saturday March 3rd. State Park website with address and park phone number is here: http://www.floridasta... 

This is a great hike! There are many awesome views of the river and plenty of opportunities for wildlife viewing. I have seen alligators, river otters, and deer on this hike. Who knew there were CLASS 3 RAPIDS IN FLORIDA?!?!?!

This is an intermediate level hike open to hikers in good physical condition. Hikers should bring lunch, snacks, at least 2 quarts of water, bugspray, and shoes suitable for walking long distances. I will monitor the weather and may give additional advice based on that or other factors. Note that I may cancel the hike due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances. The hiking distance is approximately 6-7 miles and hikers should budget about 5 hours for this activity.

Directions from Jax: Take I-10 West to Exit #301. Make a left at the end of the ramp onto US 41 North. Drive 8 miles on US 41 North and make a right onto County Rd 135 (3rd St.). Proceed on County Rd 135 (drive past the Little Shoals entrance) and make a right onto SE 94th St. (Old Godwin Bridge Rd) and drive to the end. There will be the self-pay station and the parking lot for the Big Shoals trail-head.

Note that hikers are responsible for a $4 per car park admission fee and exact change in cash is required.

Hikers will be shuttled back from the Little Shoals end point back to the Big Shoals parking area. I will require at least one volunteer from the group to accomplish this. Anyone interested in volunteering to help out with shuttle duty please contact me for more details.

If you have any health issues, you may wish to write them down on a card and keep in your pack. The leaders will respect your privacy unless there is a medical emergency. Also include a name of a contact person to call.

See you there!

Anyone interested in carpooling to this Hike. I am on the west side near 5 Points.
 Posted March 2 at 9:20 AM Bill Gentry 
Greetings! We are still on for tomorrow morning. NOTE that the weather may become unstable after noon. SO I ask that all hikers please be prompt: If you are unfamiliar with the location, shoot to be there at least 15 minutes early. Also, I would like at least one additional volunteer to assist with&quot;Shuttling&quot;: Post a reply if you are interested and I will contact you privately with the details. See you tomorrow!

We are the North Florida Trailblazers, the local chapter of the Florida Trail Association (FTA). Our main purpose is to build and maintain sections of the Florida Trail in our area. Sections are located at the Osceola National Forest, along the Suwannee River near White Springs, Goldhead State Park, Camp Blanding, and even the Keystone Airport. When we are not working on the Trail, we also backpack, paddle, day hikes, etc.

Please visit www.floridatrail.org and join The Florida Trail Association to support hiking and hiking trails in Florida.

The Florida Trail is part of the National Scenic Trails system (includes the AT and the Natchex Trace, for example). Our Trail is a footpath-only. There are 17 chapters throughtout the state of Florida. We have regional meetings and an annual Hiking festival. We are using www.meetup.com as another way to reach interested hikers in the Jacksonville metro area. If you want to learn more about the Florida Trail (or better yet - join) go to the link below.
