 Litigation Status Report 
 Update, April 24, 2004 
On Friday, the Supreme Court denied Save Audubon Park&apos;s application for writs, ending Save Audubon Park&apos;s 
suit challenging the Clubhouse. No reasons were given, as is usually the case. The denial leaves standing 
the Referee&apos;s decision which held that the Clubhouse does not contain a restaurant, but which admitted that 
his reasoning led to &quot;absurd results&quot;.
 Update, February 5, 2004 
The 4th Circuit Court of Appeal has 
affirmed the District Court&apos;s ruling upholding the decision of the Board of 
Zoning Adjustments.
The decision is attached . (Adobe Acrobat file, 410Kb)
Theappellate courtagreed 
withSave Audubon Park in part, holding that issues of law in appeals from the 
BZA are to be decided de novo, and that no deference is to be given to the BZA 
on such questions.
On the merits, the appellate court merely adopted thereasons 
of the Referee appointed by theDistrict Courtand incorporated them into its 
decision. That decision relied on the 50% rule in the Zoning Ordinance, which 
provides that, inorder to be a restaurant, an&quot;establishment where prepared 
foods . . are offered for sale&quot;mustreceive 50% of its income from the&quot;sales 
of such foods . . . exclusive of alcoholic beverages.&quot;
The Referee himself noted 
that his application of the50% rule &quot;can lead to absurd results,&quot; as it would 
&quot;allow a fast food restaurant to operate within a clubhouse and not be 
classified as a &quot;restaurant.&quot;
As Save Audubon Park attorney Keith Hardie argued to the 4th Circuit, it would also 
lead to the absurd conclusionthat a restaurant in a large hotel, such as 
Victor&apos;s Restaurant in the Ritz-Carlton, would not be a restaurant, because the 
room rentals wouldexceed the food income. Indeed, if non-food-and-beverage 
income is considered in detemining whether the 50% rule is met, one could serve extensive gourmetmeals in any 
type of business (coin-operated laundry, hardware store, etc.) without having to 
obtain a permit for a &quot;restaurant,&quot; so long as the income fromnon-food items 
(hardware + alcohol, laundry receipts + alcohol, etc.) exceeded receipts from 
food alone. Indeed, a&quot;hardware store&quot; couldreceive 21% of its income from 
hardware, 30%from alcoholic beverages, and49% from food, and not be a 
restaurant!
This decision would make it impossible for the City to regulate 
restaurants contained within other types of businesses.
We strongly believe that the court&apos;s 
interpretation of the &quot;50% rule&quot; is erroneous. The CZO clearly forbids restaurants in Audubon Park outside 
of the zoo, whether inside a larger building or not.

&quot;Audubon&apos;s restaurant&quot;, where you can &quot;enjoy the view from the restaurant&apos;s veranda&quot;...
 Referee Rules in Board of Zoning Adjustments Appeal of Clubhouse Permit 
On April 10, 2003, the court-appointed Referee issued his recommendation to 
Judge Medley in Save Audubon Park&apos;s lawsuit appealing the 
BZA ruling that upheld the permit for the new golf clubhouse. Save Audubon 
Park had challenged the proposed clubhouse permit, claiming that the large 
commercial kitchen and dining areas included in the plans violated zoning 
regulations, which allow restaurants in park districts &quot;within boundaries of 
a zoo only.&quot;
The Referee, Micky Landry, said the main issue was 
whether or not the clubhouse is a restaurant. He found that, while the common 
sense view was that the clubhouse &quot;certainly contains a restaurant&quot;, the 
relevant definition of a restaurant &quot;is not the same as is found in a 
dictionary&quot; (that being &quot;a place which serves meals to the public&quot;), and that 
the City&apos;s Zoning Ordinance contains as a requirement, in its definition of a 
restaurant, that the sale of food, &quot;exclusive of alcoholic beverages, must 
constitute fifty (50) percent or more of the revenue for said establishment&quot; 
in order for it to be defined as a restaurant.
Save Audubon Park had argued that the &quot;fifty percent rule&quot; was designed to distinguish between bars 
and restaurants, neither of which are permitted in a park district. While the 
Referee stated that he found Save Audubon Park&apos;s argument &quot;persuasive&quot;, he 
held that &quot;the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, due to the fifty percent plus 
definition, prohibits the clubhouse from being defined as a restaurant.&quot;
However, he went on to state: &quot;The Referee is mindful of the fact that 
this definition (fifty percent of its sales has to come from food) can lead 
to absurd results. For instance, under the law and this ruling, the clubhouse 
could literally allow a fast food restaurant to move into its facility, and 
as long as fifty percent of its total revenues did not come from the fast 
food restaurant, the clubhouse could not and would not be classified as a 
&quot;restaurant.&quot; If a reviewing Court were to find that the food-serving 
establishment within clubhouses should be defined differently, then the 
opposite result may be reached.&quot;
The Referee concluded: &quot;Given the facts 
and the law in this case, the Referee is faced with the inescapable 
conclusion that until the revenues from the food service of the clubhouse 
constitute fifty percent or more of the total revenues of the clubhouse, that 
clubhouse could never be defined as a restaurant&quot;, and he ruled in favor of 
the Audubon Commission/Audubon Institute&apos;s motion, and against Save Audubon 
Park.
Our attorney is reviewing the Referee&apos;s recommendations, which must 
be reviewed and either accepted or rejected by Judge Medley.
 Background 
On June 17, 2002, the Department of Safety and Permits issued a building permit for a golf clubhouse to 
be built in Audubon Park. On July 29, 2002, Save Audubon Park appealed the issuance of the building 
permit to the Board of Zoning Adjustments (&quot;BZA&quot;), on the grounds that the plans did not conform to the Comprehensive Zoning 
Ordinance (&quot;CZO&quot;) because they included a restaurant, and restaurants were not permitted in &quot;P&quot; 
park districts.
The CZO states that restaurants are allowed in parks &quot;within the boundaries of a 
zoo only.&quot; At the hearing before the BZA, one of the members of the BZA, Rev. Moses Gordon, noted 
that the drawings &quot;seemed to be restaurant intensive.&quot; The board made 
a finding of fact that the plans showed a clubhouse containing a restaurant. The BZAs ruling referred 
to &quot;the restaurant contained in the proposed new . . . golf clubhouse,&quot; and to &quot;the restaurant.&quot;
Though the BZA noted that the structure contained a restaurant, it nonetheless held that the 
&quot;plans and specs for the new construction of a one story golf clubhouse . . . conform to the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.&quot;
Save Audubon Park believed that this this motion was 
incorrect and appealed the BZAs decision to the District Court.
The statute governing appeals of Board of Zoning Adjustments decisions allows the court to 
determine whether additional evidence is necessary and to appoint a &quot;referee&quot; to hear that 
evidence. Judge Lloyd Medley first appointed Dominic Gianna. Mr. Gianna was removed because 
he was involved in litigation with the attorney for the Audubon Institute and Commission, 
Henry &quot;Tut&quot; Kinney. In his place, Mickey Landry, of the firm Landry and Swarr, was appointed.
On appeal, the Audubon Commission and Institute have argued that, because Golf Clubhouses are 
allowed in parks, and because golf clubhouses customarily serve food, the building permit was 
legal.
They also claim that the &quot;food service facility&quot; contained in the clubhouse is not a 
restaurant because the Clubhouse would receive most of its income from green fees and cart 
rentals, and not from the sale of food.
Zoning regulations define a restaurant as an 
&quot;establishment&quot; which receives more than 50% of its income from food and beverages, 
exclusive of alcoholic beverages. Save Audubon Park has argued that the specific 
limitation of restaurants to zoos should override any custom or usage, and that since 
there are a significant number of golf clubhouses that have no food service or no restaurant, 
a permit allowing a clubhouse does not automatically include a restaurant.
Concerning the 
requirement that a restaurant receive 50% of its income from food, exclusive of alcoholic 
beverages, Save Audubon Park has maintained that income from food must be measured against 
income from alcoholic beverages, not against income from non-food and beverage income. 
Save Audubon Park believes this regulation was intended to distinguish restaurants from bars, 
such that any food and beverage establishment earning more than 50% of its income 
from alcoholic beverages would be considered a bar.
 Discovery 
Save Audubon Park took the depositions of Carlos Cashio, the lead architect on the new Clubhouse, 
Dale Stastny, the CFO of ANI, and Max Futch, the &quot;food services design consultant&quot; on the new 
clubhouse. Save Audubon Park also subpoenaed records from the Futch firm, the Cashio-Cochran 
architectural firm and the Chrestia architectural firm, which drafted a furniture layout for the 
clubhouse.
One of the most telling documents obtained was the specifications for kitchen equipment. 
This kitchen, which, according to Audubon, isnt part of a restaurant, contains a 
Booster Heater and Dishwasher capable of sanitizing 53 racks of dishes per hour; a 
thirty gallon tilting brazing pan with a capacity of 960 4 oz. servings; a convection 
oven with a capacity for five 18&quot; x 26&quot; standard full size baking pans; a Mobile Banquet Cart, 
which can hold 12 18&quot; x 26&quot; trays for use in serving hundreds of patrons at a time; a double 
basket fryer, 36&quot; charbroiler, and a 4-burner Range with oven and salamander, comparable 
to that found in many restaurants.
The Chrestia furniture layout, which has been posted 
on the website, shows seating for 125 patrons in the new clubhouse. Ninety-six of those 
seats are at tables for four, restaurant style.
Henry Kinney, 
the lawyer for both the public Audubon Commission and the private non-profit corporation, 
is also the attorney for Cashio-Cochran, the architects for both the Tea Room and the Clubhouse. 
Our attorney asked Carlos Cashio, the lead architect on the clubhouse, how much he had been paid 
by the Audubon Institute, but Mr. Kinney instructed Cashio not to answer that question. Cashio 
stated that he did not have a degree in architecture.
 Motions 
Both parties filed a number of motions, including motions asking the court to render summary 
judgment, which can conclude the case without a trial. The motions were heard on Friday, February 21. 
The referee indicated his leaning on many of the motions on Friday, but took the motions for summary 
judgment under consideration. If he recommends granting of summary judgment for one of the parties, 
the matter will be heard by Judge Lloyd Medley, who can accept or reject the findings of the Referee 
in his final judgment.
Early on, Audubon had insisted that that it would be necessary to take depositions. However, after 
numerous depositions were taken, Audubon changed its mind and filed a motion asking the court to 
disregard all evidence taken by the parties and to focus entirely on the record produced before the 
BZA. The court denied this motion, noting that the question of whether additional evidence could be 
taken was discretionary with the court, and that Audubon should have appealed the decision to allow 
the taking of additional evidence earlier.
After the deposition of Max Futch, the &quot;food service facilities designer&quot; for the clubhouse, 
Save Audubon Park had filed an amended petition, claiming that the clubhouse not only contained 
an illegal restaurant, but also was designed to function as a catering and/or banquet facility. 
Audubon CFO Dale Stastny admitted that the clubhouse will serve &quot;tournament banquets&quot; to golfers. 
The amendment asked for a permanent injunction prohibiting the operation of the proposed clubhouse 
in any manner inconsistent with the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.
The Audubon defendants filed a 
motion opposing the amendment, stating that Save Audubon Park did not have a cause of action that 
would permit an injunction, and that the court could only &quot;review&quot; the BZAs decision. On February 21, 
the Referee said he would deny the amendment, but said that this would not prevent him from 
recommending injunctive relief if he found it appropriate.
The Audubon Commission had filed a motion seeking the bank records of Save Audubon Park and 
the names of all people contacted by Save Audubon Park. Save Audubon Park argued that forcing 
it to reveal the names of its donors, those who had received its email newsletters, and those it 
had spoken to concerning the clubhouse would chill the right to free association guaranteed by the 
U.S. and Louisiana Constitutions and the Charter of the City of New Orleans. The referee apparently 
agreed, and refused to order Save Audubon Park to produce the confidential information.
In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Audubon defendants had filed an affidavit 
by Patricia Fretwell, former Chief Planner for the City Planning Commission. Fretwells affidavit 
said that, in her opinion, the &quot;food service . . . facilities&quot; in the new clubhouse were appropriate 
in a park district. She also claimed that there was no restaurant in the clubhouse because revenues 
from food service &quot;will not exceed fifty (50%) percent of the revenues for the entire golf clubhouse.&quot;
Save Audubon Park moved to strike this affidavit, arguing that Ms. Fretwells affidavit primarily 
interpreted the law, which was the prerogative of the court, and that it did not provide a 
reasonable explanation of how its conclusions were reached. The referee said he would recommend 
that the affidavit not be stricken, but that it would be considered for the worth of its statements.
Next, the parties argued the summary judgment motions.
Save Audubon Parks attorney argued that the 
law clearly prohibited restaurants in parks, except in zoos, and that what might be permissible in 
a clubhouse somewhere else would be illegal in a clubhouse located in a park. He pointed out that 
Audubon had admitted that the kitchen and dining areas in the proposed clubhouse met the 
first half of the CZOs definition of a restaurant: an establishment that sold food and 
drink. He argued that the second half of that definition, which requires that 50% of the 
revenues of the &quot;establishment&quot; come from food, exclusive of alcoholic beverages, required 
to court to compare the income from food to that from alcoholic beverages, not the income 
from food to the green fees and cart rental. He also noted that Audubon itself had 
referred to the &quot;full service dining facilities&quot; in the clubhouse in its brief, 
indicating that the structure clearly included a restaurant.
Audubons attorney 
argued that restaurants were customary in golf clubhouses. He also argued that the 
court should not consider the fact that commercial activities might interfere with 
walkers, joggers and birdwatchers, noting that even denser uses, such as football 
stadiums, were allowed in park districts.
The last motion to be considered was Audubons motion to increase the bond for costs from 
$1,000 to $5,000. The referee, noting that his fees were over $8,000, said he would 
recommend that it be increased to $10,000.
