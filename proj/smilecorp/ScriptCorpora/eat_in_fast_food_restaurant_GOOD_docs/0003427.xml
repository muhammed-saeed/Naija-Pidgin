Spain, Malaga, Mijas Costa
 Asking Price €40,000 (Leasehold)

• Established Fish and Chip Takeaway/Restaurant
• Steady Year Round Trade
• No Local Competition
• Trading Minimal Hours
• Massive Development Potential


Playa Marina is a long established urbanization very well positioned between Fuengirola and the very much British and town of La Cala on Spain’s Costa del Sol. Benefiting from the adjacent coastal highway, Malaga airport is easily reached in 20 minutes - as is the ever popular resort of Marbella.

The local area comprises of a good mix of residential and holiday homes together with extremely well known and prestigious beach clubs and resorts. Local residents and property owners are predominantly British and Irish with the Germans, Dutch and Scandinavians also well represented.

The commercial area or Strip, contains a number of cafes and bars, pharmacy, hardware store, hair and beauty salon and of course, this fish and chip shop which is now in its 5th year of trading. A total of 40 covers are offered between the inside restaurant and the sunny terrace which offers beautiful views of the Mediterranean. Many customers of course prefer the take-away option and there is ample free parking to accommodate this.

Internally, the premises are extremely well presented and comes fully equipped with a 2 pan range and all necessary equipment. There is also a fully licensed bar with a separate kitchen and both ladies and gents toilets towards the rear.

Our clients have other business interests locally and this lovely little business has been managed rather than developed. Currently trading a total of 24 hours over 6 evenings, there is so much potential to take this business further forward. New owners would surely want to extend these hours and capitalise on the lunch trade that is available throughout the year. The menu is both simple yet traditional and again could be expanded to include pizza, fried chicken and kebabs for which again there is no local competition. Given the minimal hours currently worked, trading figures suggest that this is an excellent opportunity - ideal for a couple’s first business here in Spain - and keenly priced.
