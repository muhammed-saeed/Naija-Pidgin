 My Day with Ashlyn 

August 31, 2008 at 2:36 am ( Uncategorized )

Today Ashlyn came over to play.  We had a lot of fun.  We went over to Gami and Gampa’s pool, played in my house and played outside.  Overall it was a great day.  Mom took a couple of pictures and a video of me swimming all by myself.
