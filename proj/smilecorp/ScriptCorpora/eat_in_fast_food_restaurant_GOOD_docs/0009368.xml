Anybody remember when this place used to have the mini TVs at each table? That was a pretty cool idea. Too bad every single dumb-ass wanna-be tagger had to ruin it for the rest of us and scratch the screens into oblivion. But we&apos;re talking about Amy&apos;s food aren&apos;t we?

Let me begin by saying that I&apos;ve been going to this place for years. My dad used to work at the nearby Doubletree Hotel and would often bring us food from Amy&apos;s. Later, it became one of my favorite Pasadena hangouts. Great, relaxed environment, good food (the BEST spicy chicken sandwich anywhere - ANYWHERE), generous portions, and outstanding service. What more could you want? Well, I do miss those TVs...

When in doubt in Pasadena, don&apos;t think about it. Just go to Amy&apos;s. Your stomach shall not regret it (although your waistline may).

Let me start off by saying that their fried zucchini is my favorite item here.  The crust is crispy but soft at the same time, and the zucchini itself is cooked just right, not soggy and not underdone.  I usually come here for lunch and order the small size.  It&apos;s big enough to fill me up when I&apos;m not too hungry.  Otherwise, I&apos;ll order the large.  It&apos;s so good I can just eat that alone for lunch.

I&apos;ve also tried their burrito, which is big enough to feed 2, but it doesn&apos;t taste especially good.  I heard that the manager&apos;s special hamburger is very tasty.  I might try that next time I eat here, and since portions are quite big, I&apos;m definitely going to share it with a friend.

They recently remodeled and all their seating and tables are new and clean.  Their patio is the best place to sit if you don&apos;t mind people passing by when they enter the restaurant.
