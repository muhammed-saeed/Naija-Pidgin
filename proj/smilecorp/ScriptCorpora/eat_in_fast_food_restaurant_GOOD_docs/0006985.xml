Fast food and teen obesity linked

A Shasta High School student eats In-N-Out at the end of lunch period. A new study shows that high schoolers who attend school within a tenth of a mile of a fast food restaurant tend to be fatter that those that go to school that are further away. Junior and seniors at Shasta are allowed to leave the campus in a car during lunch.
 
When the wind is blowing just right, you can smell Burger King flame-broiling its hamburgers from the Shasta High School campus.

Andrew Valli and Russell Gregory, both juniors at Shasta High, were at the fast-food eatery Friday to get lunch.

&quot;You get away from the (school) crowd,&quot; Valli said.

&quot;And it&apos;s better food,&quot; added Gregory.

Researchers and educators, however, worry about the nutrition these meals provide to adolescents.

A study released last month by Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley showed that freshmen at schools within one-tenth of a mile of fast-food restaurants failed body-fat tests more often than their peers at schools located farther away from those types of eateries.

Shasta High is the only high school in the county that is a ketchup packet&apos;s throw from fast-food restaurants. Burger King and Carl&apos;s Jr. are just under a half-mile from the school.

The nearest fast-food restaurant to Enterprise High School is McDonald&apos;s, more than a mile away. Anderson High School is more than a mile and a half from the nearest Burger King or McDonald&apos;s.

Local health experts are concerned. While there are no studies comparing the rates of failed body-fat tests among high-schoolers in Shasta County, the percentage of overweight teens in the county is higher than the state average.

Nationwide, 27 percent of the adolescents here are overweight, said Gloria Espinosa-Hall, a nutrition specialist for Shasta County Public Health.

Only 19 percent of teens are overweight statewide, according to the UCLA Center for Healthy Policy Research.

&quot;It&apos;s definitely a problem,&quot; Espinosa-Hall said. &quot;And it&apos;s a growing problem.&quot;

Gregory and Valli, who consider themselves fit, say they have heard all the talk about the importance of eating nutritious food but they don&apos;t spend a lot of time worrying about it.

&quot;They have just as worse food there as here,&quot; Gregory said of his school.

Loganpaul Eickhoff and Troy Kapple were on their way back to Shasta High on Friday with a bagful of burgers from Carl&apos;s Jr. Both are juniors and both play sports. They seldom head out to the nearby eateries for lunch, they said.

But even if they did, nutrition wouldn&apos;t be much of a concern, they said.

&quot;We&apos;re really active,&quot; Eickhoff said.

&quot;I work out twice a day,&quot; Kapple said.

Denise Axtel, head of the food service department at the Shasta Union High School District, has her office at Shasta High School.

&quot;We definitely see them bringing fast food onto campus,&quot; she said.

It&apos;s within their rights, she added. However, she said, the school works hard to offer fresh fruits and vegetables and healthy lunches for its students as an alternative.

&quot;Can you make every single one (eat healthy)? No,&quot; she said. But all the school&apos;s offerings &quot;do get them to think about it.&quot;

What was the favorite stop of teens in the 50s? The hamburger/fries/shake drive-in. Seems a lack of need for activity has played a part in this too. There&apos;s no reason for teens to walk anywhere and they can spend the rest of their waking hours in front of a screen. Parents need to encourage food moderation and physical activity then display the same example.

Unfortunately it really depends on the adolescent(age 12-18) metabolism to process the food. Here a LINK that explains what RS does not:
 http://kidshealth.org/teen/diseases_c... 

There is a movie that came out in 2006, that most people never saw that shows what happens to the US population in the future. From eating Fast-food, not exercising, etc..&quot;Idiocracy&quot;- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy 

The movie: Funny, Stupid&amp;Brainless comedy, but unfortunately that is way our economy is headed, with this generation and the next of kids... I worked in the schools, I have seen it. The schools don&apos;t help either.

Fast food is only a minor part of the problem. The real problem is only having 2 days of physical education at school. These kids aren&apos;t getting the exercise like we used to. Gameboys, nintendos, cable tv with a remote control are what they are doing these days. Parents must demand their kids get outside and do something. Try bike riding, baseball, basketball, football, golf, disc golf, skateboarding, or try a family walk. Us parents are the ones that must show leadership for our children.

Then mommy and daddy need to make leftovers or the kiddos need to put forth the effort to wake up earlier and fix a sandwich or something else.

It&apos;s all too easy to turn the keys and toss a few bucks out the window instead of putting together something decent for lunch either the night before or first thing in the morning.

I really think that the problem is in the lack of exercise, not the food. Burgers/fries/shakes are not a new concept. Maybe we need to revive roller skates!!

On another note just how nutritious is the school food? Look at a menu and you will be baffled as to how they call that nutritious. Four out of five mornings at my kids school they serve the likes of french toast sticks, cinnamon rolls, and buttermilk bars, with the only protien coming from milk. And we ask ourselves why the children are tired? But Gatorade is not allowed in schools, whatever.

No disrespect here, but I think you misunderstand the point of this article. Yeah, everyone knows fast food makes you fat. The study, however, shows that easy access to it (i.e., fast food parked next to schools), makes kids even FATTER.

Ergo, we need to look at a bunch of possible remedies: how to get kids to exercise more, how to educate them about fast food (nutrition classes have been cut along with PE), possible zoning restrictions on junk food vendors, providing healthier options at school cafeterias, and reconsidering off campus privileges.

lol, I know....I was just being sarcastic. I think kids of that age know it makes them fat also...it is just faster to grab fast food than take a healthy lunch to school. This should have been taught by their parents btw, not some&quot;study&quot;, imo....and I agree with whomever said school lunches should be suspect, also....because some of that stuff served isn&apos;t the healthiest either.

I agree, the school lunches historically have been horrible. There&apos;s been some improvement on that front recently. But again, the problem identified by this study is that easy access to junk food exacerbates the obesity issue. The study wasn&apos;t intended to&quot;teach&quot;the kids, and yes, the kids should learn some things from their parents. But that&apos;s not happening for a variety of reasons (like the parents don&apos;t KNOW or the kids come from broken families). Consequently, the study raises some real questions about what WE can do.

Should WE care about kids getting fat? Yes. Obesity raises the cost of everything for everyone: health care, airline tickets, cars (designed now in the U.S for fat people), etc. So it&apos;s not just a social problem. When a third of the population is fat, we all pay for it.

Incidentally, I had nothing to do with this study or the local schools. Just another citizen (like you!!) who cares about our beatiful little community.

That is a good question. I don&apos;t think most do. Like we HAD to have PE. There is another problem contributing to teen obesity, seriously...not enough exercise, and too much easy access crappy food. I feel kinda bad for kids these days, seems like so much is against them and they have to be more careful and try harder than we had to.

I don&apos;t see what the big deal is. Last I checked, students are not held at gunpoint and forced to go to BK, Taco Bell etc.

Back when Foothill was downtown, every now and then my friends and I would got grab burgers or taco&apos;s. Maybe once a week, not everyday.

When we moved here....our kids for the first time saw the fattest people ever. They grew up in Europe and its different there. The Europeans think Americans are fat anyway. That&apos;s what they see with American tourists. But whatever the problem is we are heavier than most countries. I think many things contribute to the fat factor. Some genetics, lack of exercise,&amp;eating habits. There needs to be a big overhaul on everyone&apos;s lifestyle that&apos;s for sure. But will it ever happen is the question?

You got that right....we couldn&apos;t even whine about&quot;that time of the month&quot;and try to get out of it...our teachers had NO sympathy, none. We did PE.

I went to a high school with an open campus. We were encouraged to leave for lunch, as the cafeteria would not hold all the students.

The walk to the local Frostie and back was about 1/4 mile. The only time I ever ate lunch on campus was when it was raining (not very often in S.CA).

However, P.E. was mandatory, and we were required to not only play volleyball/basketball/softball/tennis, etc., each day we had to run the 1/4 mile track...no excuses.

The main reasons for the kids today being overweight begin in elementary school: no recess, and tons of either TV or video games. None of them go home and rollerskate (or rollerblade), ride bikes, hike for miles in the canyons, or(my dad&apos;s favorite&quot;) mow the lawn with a push mower. It&apos;s the lack of exercise that&apos;s the problem, not the fast food for lunch.

One more problem, though, is the working parents who bring home fast foods every day and serve only pre-packaged, high fat content foods for both dinner and breakfast. Also, have you seen what they serve in the school cafeterias? It&apos;s also prepared, pre-packaged (even peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are pre-packaged)...and high in fat content.

Mmmm ... I love cheeseburgers and nachos and whatever else I want to eat; But I am still thin. Why? Because I eat junk food in mdoeration. I teach my kids to do the same.

As for school cafeteria food...it is NOT healthy! They offer salad, fruit etc., but the kids choose the pizza (from dominos), the burgers, the nachos etc. instead.
