 Our featured buyer is a Private Family Trust with private equity available for various acquisition and other equity needs. 

Location: Nationwide. 

Types of Equity Needs and Properties 

 Medical / Healthcare facilities or campus associated with a city, state, or any government entity. Also, similar properties associated with a college or university. 

 ALL CASH buyer for ground lease properties and also long term single tenant net leased properties as long as they are mature below market leases (no sale-leasebacks or recent leases) with buildings that will have a residual value later. Strong consideration is given to accepting a very low initial cap rate (lower than market current returns) in exchange for some future increases and/or fair market value rent adjustments. This is not a retail rent buyer. New leases and any other properties at market rents and market cap rates are of no interest. With regards to ground leases, the buyer prefer to purchase the land under single family residences, condominium projects, shopping centers, mobile home parks, apartment buildings, hotels/motels, or office buildings. Will buy property from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000 (or more). The buyer wants the ground lease tenant to have a substantial equity position so that the buyer knows that the seller will be likely to continue payments on the lease. Prefers to purchase sites where, in the event that the buyer gets the improvements back (due to a lease default or reversion at the end of the lease term), then the buyer is rewarded for the time and trouble. This buyer can react quickly and close quickly and again in all cash. 

 Foundry properties (factories that produce metal castings) 

 Major Fast-Cash Asset Needs 

 Private-Label Bottled Water promotion company or, a private label company with a strong sales force and strong customer accounts. This buyer will outright purchase the company or, provide passive investment equity into the company. The company must be profitable. If not profitable, a strong track record of past retail history and time in the private-label business will be considered. Acquisitions must include a purchase of the company&apos;s customer lists and the company&apos;s goodwill. Preference is for companies with gross sales receipts of at least $5 million but will consider all situations. 

 All other Troubled Real Estate 

 Troubled Companies or Businesses seeking increased liquidity to fund operations, fund efforts to regain financial strength, fund reinvestments, or generally to fund or meet other capital requirements. 

 Deep Discounted Assets (including large luxury homes). Includes real estate portfolios, REOs, under-performing assets, critically distressed or undervalued portfolios. 

 Ongoing Real Estate Projects (other than residential real estate projects). 

 Acquisition of Intangible Equity Instrument portfolios like Seasoned Life Settlements, Student Loans, Structured Settlement Annuities, etc.

On-Going Businesses or Projects (Equity Participation, JV, or creative loan). 

 A proven track record of profitability must be in place. 

 Not considering start up companies or projects. 

 The borrower must be able to share the risk. Invested principal, at a minimum, must be collateralized at the time of investment. Future value will not be used as a form of collateralization. 

 Payments to this lender will also need to be on a FIFO/LIFO basis (first/last invested funds in, first out). 

 The amount of initial equity need, along with any need for future cash draws, will be assessed against projections provided. Please be prepared to provide projections in a realistic 1 to 5 year Business Plan, which will be used to come up with a equity proposal. The proposal is typically provided quickly, provided the Business Plan and projections can be backed up with things like contracts, customer orders, etc. The providing of Financial Statements will also help in coming up with the proposal.
