 First class fast food comes to South Coast Plaza 
 August 31st, 2011, 5:48 am by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 

Two weeks before Sid Fanarof, founder of Zpizza, debuted his new concept Z cafe at South Coast Plaza all hell broke loose.

The new hearth stone oven didn’t work. The stovetop was on the fritz. The dishwasher was broken. The sprinkler system went off, drenching half the kitchen.

“What else could go wrong?”he thought to himself.

How about this: his general manager quit to go work for a sit-down eatery.

“It was my Black Friday,”said Fanarof, 67.

Somehow he managed to make something of the disastrous day.

The following week, the oven was fixed and an energy-efficient dishwasher installed. A new grill turned out to be a better fit for creating his earthy dishes—which, like zpizza, are made from locally grown produce, organic dairy and naturally raised meats.

And his new general manager?  Fanarof said he can’t imagine a better person running the show.

“All challenges turned out be blessings in disguise,”he said.

Before the opening, Fanarof had been flying by the seat of his pants.

When California Pizza Kitchen closed its fast-casual CPK ASAP restaurant in January,  South Coast Plaza turned to Fanarof hoping he would take the space.

Fanarof’s zpizza chain, which he founded 25 years ago in Laguna Beach, has earned the kind of reputation South Coast Plaza desires: high-end, health conscious food that consumers are willing to spend a few more dollars for.

Once the two struck a deal,  Zcafe was born—or at least conceived.

Until the final few days before zcafe opened , Fanarof and his new chef—a recent culinary school graduate—spent hours at his home creating dishes.  Everything on the menu is based on Fanarof’s fanatical love for perfect food combinations.

That means, first and foremost, zcafe dishes are packed with flavor and have wide palate appeal. And, as much as possible, nearly everything is fresh—from the ricotta to the chutney to the sweet barbecue sauce layered on his rustic thin-crust pizzas.

“Fresh, organic and locally produced, whenever possible,”a mantra Fanarof  has been stating for years—and long before it was trendy.

The 2,000-square-foot fast-casual eatery opened in mid-August on the third-level of the mall wing formerly known as Crystal Court.

The third-floor location, with a patio view of the Bridge of Gardens, has been transformed into a chic fast-casual cafe with Caesar stone communal tables, flat screen TVs and a menu of gourmet pizzas, sandwiches and salads priced under $10.

“It’s first class food at fast food prices,”Fanarof said.

Still, it’s been slow for the first few weeks. His most loyal customers, so far, are the Apple employees who work nearby and moms with strollers who love to take a load off on the sofas on the outdoor patio.

Fanarof expects foot traffic to increase during the holidays, and when he adds live entertainment and wine and beer later this fall. Once he gets his liquor license, he’ll sell wine by the glass for $7 to $10 and bottled craft beer for about $4.

“Once people find out about us, they’ll realize its the best bang for your buck,”he said.

 South Coast Plaza finds replacement for closed CPK unit 
 May 4th, 2011, 10:45 am by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
Irvine-based Zpizza founder Sid Fanarof
 
 South Coast Plaza plans to announce Thursday that it has found a replacement cafe to fill the spot once occupied by California Pizza Kitchen ASAP .

The CPK fast-casual restaurant, located on the west end of the Bridge of Gardens, closed earlier this year.  The third-level restaurant space will become ZCafe, a new pizza concept by Sid Fanarof—founder of Irvine-based Zpizza. 

The mall released few details about ZCafe’s menu—only stating that foods will be made with fresh, healthy and locally-sourced ingredients.  The menu will feature appetizers, salads, sandwiches, soups, and pizza, as well as specialty desserts, organic coffee, tea, and wine and beer. The restaurant will also offer free wi-fi and phone charging stations for diners.

South Coast Plaza representatives said the new 2,000-square-foot restaurant, designed by Mark Singer and Associates, will also boast a 1,400 square-foot patio with total seating for 120 guests.

“We’re delighted to have Sid Fanarof create a new, fresh concept expressly for South Coast Plaza,” said Debra Gunn Downing, executive director of  marketing for South Coast Plaza. “Our shoppers will love to have a new dining spot for high quality, casual fare.”
