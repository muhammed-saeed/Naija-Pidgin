Former fast-food manager jailed for giving teen cashier cocaine

A 37-year-old Los Angeles man was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to supplying a 17-year-old girl with a small amount of cocaine in 2008.

Alberto Carretero , who was the former manager of a fast-food restaurant at the Camarillo Premium Outlets, provided a line of cocaine for the female cashier to snort during work, said prosecutor Margaret Coyle.

Police were notified of the incident that took place in September 2008 after the girl told a school counselor, according to Coyle.

Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce Young said that it was sad that someone of Carretero’s age with no substantial criminal record could commit this crime, which he said was “serious and has severe consequences.”

Carretero’s lawyer, Claudia Bautista, who works in the Public Defender’s Office, told the judge her client is a family man who has worked all his life and is remorseful for what he did. He also took responsibility for this crime early, Bautista said.

Coyle said Carretero had a very small amount of cocaine when he was arrested.

Carretero, who was not in custody, was handcuffed by the court bailiff and taken to county jail.

Why is it that the adult is the only one that gets punished? The girl knew it was an illegal substance, and he didn&apos;t force it up her nose, did he? Be she&apos;s the victim? How about when a slutty high school girl teases and seduces a teacher, and than he gets punished and she gets gets no punishmenent. If they would punish the minors also, there would be less of this happening
