 SIGNS OF SPRING - Return of Migrating Birds and Daffodils 
 To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating;
to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter; to be thrilled by the 
stars at night;
to be elated over a birds nest or a wildflower in spring these are some of the rewards of the simple life.

 MOTIVATIONAL WORDS
The future is not some place we are going, but one we are creating.
The paths to it are not found but made, and the activity of making them changes both
the maker and the destination.

 MY NEW WATKINS STORE 
As part of our new Brand Awareness program, Watkins is allowing Associates to sell a limited number of products on their personal web site. 
Some of you have expressed an interest in ordering one or two products and not having to pay the full shipping cost, so to save on shipping costs, you may order one, two, 
or more items for a shipping cost of only $4.00.
I have included some of the most popular products in my online store. Take a look! My Online Store 
 CONTEST 
Congratulations! February&apos;s contest winner is Audrey in Idaho. Audrey won an 8 fl oz./240 ml. bottle of moisturizing Strawberry Body Wash and Bubble Bath. 
She&apos;ll smell good enough to eat!
Audrey&apos;s favorite way to kick back and relax is to dive into my scrapbooks. I love to make scrapbooks. I currently am working on 6 scrapbooks, 
one for each of my children, one for my husband, and one for myself to keep to remind me of all the good things in life. Last year my New Year&apos;s 
Resolution was to scrapbook one hour a day, I did accomplish this goal until last June. This year, my goal is to stay organized while scrapbooking, 
but avoid the stress involved with organization!! My new motto is &apos;simplify&apos;. I also enjoy reading to relax, and I especially like to look through country 
magazines for new ideas for scrapbooking, remodeling and decorating ideas.
DON&apos;T FORGET TO ENTER MARCH&apos;S CONTEST - SPRING BREEZES
To enter this month&apos;s contest no purchase is necessary. However, I wont object if you do place an order. The winner is chosen at random.
 Saturday, March 20th is the first day of Spring. Many of our mothers, grandmothers, and great grandmothers used to clean their house thoroughly, from top
to bottom, every Spring. My grandmother used to clean and paint the walls in her kitchen every Spring. Needless to say, her kitchen as well as the rest of her house 
was always sparkling clean! 
Spring cleaning dates back to a time when people, living in the colder climates with severe winter weather, were unable to clean their homes during the winter. 
When spring arrived after a long, cold winter the windows and doors were opened wide to let in the refreshing spring breezes. The bed linens were washed and 
hung outside to dry, curtains were taken down and washed, rugs were taken out and cleaned to remove winter dirt and grime, floors and walls were scrubbed, 
and windows were polished.
Today many people still go through the ritual of Spring cleaning. So, for this month&apos;s contest, tell us if you spring clean your home. Do you thoroughly clean 
every room as your ancestors did or do you just clean certain parts of your home? Do you remove your rugs and curtains to clean them? Do you move your
furniture to clean the dust that has accumulated? Do you wash all your windows? Do you apply fresh paint to dirty or worn areas? Or, do you just carry on as usual?
Tell us whether you thoroughly Spring clean your house or whether you just let the Spring breezes blow through!
 March&apos;s winner will receive our new Shredsoap Linen Spray. This new Watkins product is available March 1st. Refresh your pillows, sheets, and other linens with a
burst of our vanilla/citrus scent.

Shredsoap Linen Spray 
Besides our first place winner I will also give each subscriber who shares with us whether they Spring Clean or just let the Spring breezes blow through a packet 
of our Snack and Dip Seasoning Mix. (If you shared with us in the past feel free to enter again. Watkins now has 13 snack and dip mixes as well as other seasoning 
mixes.)
