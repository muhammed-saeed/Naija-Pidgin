How Zeek Rewards Is Designed for You to Succeed

 By Robert David Fraser 
 
Zeek Rewards is a home based business that is task driven. Most network marketing companies are performance driven. There is a statistic going around saying that 95-98% of people who participate in network marketing fail. Paul Burks the founder of Zeek Rewards wanted to create a system that anyone can do and succeed at.

Looking at a fast food restaurant, you can see that they are operated by teenagers basically. Most of the time these fast food places are doing really well and the one thing in common is the presence of a task driven system. Teenagers can, in effect, run a fast food restaurant.

Zeek Rewards is designed the same way. Most people don&apos;t succeed in network marketing to the degree that they want to. Zeek Rewards and the Zeekler penny auctions are set up for you to succeed in the fact that they reward you daily just for placing an ad.

You place your ad to the online penny auctions and the company splits out profits at the end of every night. 50% goes to the company and 50% goes to the collective advertisers who posted their ad that day. In order to qualify for the daily reward, you need to ensure that you place your daily ad. It doesn&apos;t matter if someone clicked through your affiliate link or not. The important part is that you place your ad and that&apos;s it.

In most network marketing companies, you have to sponsor people in order to get commissions. If you don&apos;t sponsor anyone, then you don&apos;t get paid. Zeek Rewards is setup to where you can earn daily commissions without having to sponsor anyone. Personally I feel that this is really good for your own personal confidence. Think about it!

If you made a little bit of money already with the program, then when you talk to someone about it you are more confident with it. You have more confidence in the product, pay plan, and etc. That confidence will come through and because of that, you will end up sponsoring more people into the program than if you haven&apos;t made a dime.

Zeek Rewards allows you to earn both ways. You can either run solo and make some money first and then tell the world. You can also tell the world and earn at the same time. It&apos;s always a good feeling when you have a deep and unshakable confidence in your company when you talk with people. Just that very fact alone will help you succeed.

Following the daily task of posting your ad for Zeek Rewards allows you to get daily rewards. Getting daily rewards really boosts your confidence. Having high confidence will bring you much success!
