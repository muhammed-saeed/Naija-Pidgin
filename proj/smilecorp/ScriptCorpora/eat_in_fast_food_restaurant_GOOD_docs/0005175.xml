 10 Common Courtesies That Aren’t 
 by K D Blakley in Advice , March 6, 2008 

Do you wonder whatever happened to common courtesy? Feel like it isn’t so common any more? What about you? Do you try to see things from the other guy’s perspective and attempt to make his life easier?

 
How to become more courteous

Pay attention! Notice what is happening around you. Try to see how you fit into the scenery and what you can do to make someone else’s path a little easier. It often doesn’t take much. Here are some common situations that call for common courtesies.

Avoid Being a Roadblock

 If your shopping cart is blocking the aisle, move it. Sure, the extra stacks of canned goods should never have been placed in the aisle, but that’s not the other customer’s fault any more than it is yours. If your child is plugging up the escalator because he’s too afraid to get on, pull him aside and let him try again when there’s nobody else trying to use it When there’s a line of cars waiting at the gas pump, be efficient. Wash your windshield at the same time the gas is being pumped. When you’re done, get out of the way as quickly as you can. Just because you had to wait your turn, doesn’t make it OK for you to mosey up to the cashier and chat about the weather as if no one else matters. 

Lend a Helping Hand

 Hold the door open for the next guy. If your hands are full, prop the door open with your foot. On the elevator, ask those getting on if they’d like you to push their floor’s button If you are tall enough to reach an item on the top shelf at the grocery store and a diminutive old woman is precariously perched on the bottom rack of her shopping cart trying to get something down, ask her if you could be of service 

Assume the Best

 Most actions that may seem to you like a blatant disregard for your well-being are unintentional. Be gracious. Assume the best. Ignorance or oversight by another does not really deserve rude gestures, cursing or malicious revenge. Not everyone is as perfect as you might like to think you are. And it doesn’t help your blood pressure any when you get steamed up or tied up in knots. 

Help by Not Helping

 Some situations call for carefully placed help. If a child is lost, it may be better to watch over the child rather than leading him by the hand to the checkout or asking him his name. Children are taught (or should be) not to talk to strangers and you are one. Wait until the child’s parent shows up. You’ll know the right person when the child sees him. What might seem like a nice gesture could have negative consequences for you. Don’t offer a ride to a child unless you have an agreement with her parents to do so. 

Be Neighborly

 Being neighborly is more than ordinary courtesy. It is fostering a good relationship that can have far-reaching benefits for both families. Keep your children and dogs off the neighbor’s grass If your neighbor is ill, old or injured, help him with the basics. Shovel the snow from his walk. Mow the extra strip of grass between your yard and his driveway. Take his trash bin to the curb. If you have extra cookies or cupcakes, share some 

6. Foster Children

 Teach your children not to touch anyone else’s dogs or babies without first asking permission. They should also be taught not to mess with anyone else’s cars, motorcycles or boats. If an enterprising kid in the neighborhood has set up a lemonade stand, why not buy some? She might just be the kid you want to ask to take care of your pet when you go on vacation 

Give the Other Guy a Break

 If traffic has backed up and the guy behind you is left hanging out in an intersection or stuck on a railroad track, instead of relishing his predicament and admonishing him for being such an idiot, pull forward and give him a break. You might just save his life. Besides, next time you might be the idiot… If you come upon some poor guy trying to make a left turn onto the busy street you’re on and traffic is stopping ahead of you, leave a gap so he can get through 

Where Belongings Belong

 It’s simple–put things where they belong. If you use something, put it back just the way you found it when you’re finished. If you borrow something, return it in a condition that is at least as good as when you borrowed it. If you use someone else’s truck, put gas in it before returning it. If you can afford to, fill it all the way up. If you had to open a gate to get in, close the gate behind you Unless you are in your own home, leave the thermostat alone At the fast food restaurant, dump your trash in the garbage and return the tray 

Show Your Appreciation

 If someone does something courteous to you, acknowledge it with a thank-you, a nod, a smile or a wave Give a compliment if it’s warranted 

Keep it Down

 If people around you are trying to hear something–a lecturer, a movie, an announcement, or the like, be quiet. If you must speak, keep your voice down. Take your phone conversation some place out of the way. If a stranger happens to think you are talking to them when you are on your cell phone, don’t glare at them like they are idiots. Smile apologetically. You are the odd man out. 

General information
 
We’re all different. It isn’t possible to know exactly how someone else will react to your overtures. Occasionally you’ll get a nasty response when you’re trying to be courteous. These situations are unfortunate and can be a temptation to stop being polite. Try not to let it get you down. Go on being courteous. And, if it makes sense to do so, offer your help next time by asking first if the other person wants it. Most people will appreciate your efforts.

It usually doesn’t take much to make life a little easier for the other guy. If you can do so without sacrificing your own happiness or dignity, then why not? Trust me, the paybacks are well worth the extra effort, and the world will be a nicer place for it.

These are some great tips and observations!

You’re right but very specific, a general mood of
co-operativeness is what needs to be instilled in
our young people, specific examples sound like commandments
along the lines of‘though shalt not’which inplies a
hierarchy of command and feelings of powerlessness down
the chain. We should, I feel, be empowering people to
act according to conscience, not giving them a set of
guidelines to be followed like automata! Am I right?

The best thing you said in this was the first line:“Pay attention! Notice what is happening around you.”It just seems like people are completely oblivious of the world around them sometimes. Things have gotten even worse in recent years; now everyone’s got headphones on and is grooving to their own personal soundtrack. I can’t count how many times I’ve been walking down a crowded NY street on my way to work only to have to suddenly dance around some person who just randomly decides to STOP walking or who does the“cellphone strut”(aka aimlessly wandering around, changing direction and speed randomly, whilst screaming into a cellphone). Sometimes I feel like I’m the only chump left who still thinks courtesy matters.

I think you’re wonderful.

I usually feel like I’m the only person who does these things and wish that other people would.…I’m glad I’m not alone in my observations.

I agree with most of this, except asking people to push their elevator button for them. It would be more of an annoyance to most people to be offered help in such a simple task, especially when it’d probably take more time to communicate what you’re trying to offer than it’d be for them to simply push their button.

Also–I’ve never met a person who’d think it’s rude to have their dog touched without permission. I certainly wouldn’t–it’s a compliment to the cuteness of your dog.

First, thank you for your kind comments. I appreciate them very much.

Second, I just want to clarify the elevator thing. I should have said something to the effect of the person getting on having his hands full, or the elevator being crowded and you’re standing directly in front of the console.

Also, the real reason to not pet strange dogs is more a safety factor than a courtesy. I should have saved that part for a different article. Hmmm…

That was a good article and you’re exactly right. Witty title, too.

Great article! I’ll be thinking of the things you wrote when I’m in these situations. You’ve helped me. Thanks.

An expansion on the Golden Rule. Well Done.

I totally agree with you!
The problem with the world right now is that people are too engrossed with themselves that they forget there are other people around them who may need the same things they do. Then, too, some people are just unaware that such a word as“courtesy”exists. The Golden Rule.
It could sound like a commandment to a child if imposed in a“though shalt not”manner, but if they see adults doing the deeds every time, they would stop thinking about courtesy as stupid and start realizing that it’s the more sensible and wiser way to survive dog-eat-dog while keeping your dignity intact.

Loved it! I just don’t understand why this is not common sense for most people? Why do they have to be taught it? Outside of inner anger problems, where’s the love:)

Sometimes, though, holding the door when you yourself are in the doorway, or if you have a long arm and you’re standing away from the door, little women do NOT like being forced to walk under your arm, just inches from your stinky armpit!

Brad: It is rude to touch somebody’s dog without asking first. Why? Because it’s like touching somebody’s car or shirt without asking. It’s not yours, so you ask first. It’s also a big safety issue. Some dogs don’t want to be touched by strangers.

K D Blakley: Great article! The only thing I disagree with is the elevator bit.

I love especially the cell-phone tips. I myself am a“young person”but if I want to make a phone call or if I receive a phone I quickly excuse myself to an unoccupied room. One sided conversations are not only distracting, but extremely rude. My mom on the other hand does not understand this…

Wow, this article is old. It’s now 2011 and I Googled“where is the common courtesy”because today I feel it has completely gone away. In small ways, everyone seems to be against me today. Dropping my daughter off at grandma’s the road in is one lane. I am ALWAYS the driver who has to back-up for oncoming cars. Everyone else just sits there until I move. Driving to work on the two-lane freeway, cars sit in the fast lane going slow next to a semi-truck while I attempt, for miles, to remain patient. Go to the grocery store at lunch and walk up to the deli counter arriving at just the same time as someone else. When asked who was first, the other lady says she was.“But of course you were!”I say to myself. Heaven forbid anyone let me go ahead of them. And, the old blocking the isle thing was prevalent as well. I am always looking behind me and making sure I’m not blocking anyone. People just back-up, twist, turn, and shove their way infront of me. These are just the things I mention today. I’m sure there was more!

It seems to me that my generation (58 years old) has set a bad example despite exemplary training.
