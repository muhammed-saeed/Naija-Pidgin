You need to educate your wait staff on proper procedures when confronting customers on the cell phone. I understand they can&apos;t wait 4-ever on someone who is on the phone, but today I received a business call just before my food arrived at my car. The waitress could clearly see that I was involved in the call and very rudely (and loudly) went right on with her speil, as if I were not involved in anything. How rude! It honestly ruined what was otherwise a good experience. The food was good, service was quick. I gave her a $1.00 tip, far more than she deserved for her rudeness. - posted
