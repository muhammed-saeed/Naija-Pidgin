 Easily the best asian restaurant in Birmingham 

 Advantages: Close to the city centre. Excellent varied and interesting menu.
 Disadvantages: A little bit pricey for some, but you get what you pay for!


...Having watched Lasan with Gordan Ramsey&apos;s F-Word restaurant of the year award in 2009, I leapt at the opportunity to go to try out the wonderful food.

Three friends and I decided we&apos;d go during the week. The website allows you to book online and a prompt email came back confirming our table.

The area of St Paul Square (around the corner) is really cool and there are several nice bars to whet our appetite beforehand!

We were a little early for our table, but there is a really nice waiting area with a bar to keep us occupied. The service generally was first class - not in your face. You almost don&apos;t notice them, which is how it should be.

The menu offers some really unusual but fantastic dishes - so don&apos;t expect Chickin Tikka Masalla! A wonderful veal dish for main finished off a lovely evening. Great relaxed atmosphere in...

Review of Lasan Restaurant , Birmingham 
 
 McExcellence! 

 Advantages: Nice food, clean, excellent childrens area
 Disadvantages: The usual - pricey, salty and fatty food


...Sitting in McDonalds with the kids tonight it came to me. How the hell have I missed writing an op on this place? We&apos;ve got one on the way to school and I pop in most weekdays even if it&apos;s just for a coffee on the way to school (morning head!) or an ice-cream on the way home for the kids. I know our local McDonalds inside out so I thought I&apos;d enlighten you all.

I was about 10 the first time I went into a McDonalds, I remember it was magical. Ronald McDonald himself came to cut the ribbon and the restaurant was declared open. We were all given a free burger and shake and it felt so cool to be eating &apos;American&apos; food - McDonalds were in London for ages and my friend had had loads of them and told me about the delights of the Quarter Pounder, Chicken McSandwich and the wonderful sounding Big Mac. By the time Ronald McDonald cut...

Review of Mc Donalds, Birmingham 
 
 McDonalds -----Same old Story 

 Advantages: Regular Perfomance review including pay increase, management opportunities
 Disadvantages: Rude Customers, Lazy Management, long hours, lack of recognition


...where as the non smokers such as myself were expected to just have a 45minute break.

Within 5 months I had worked my way to training squad and was helping with the ongoing training of other members, another 6 months later I completed a floor managers course in Manchester which was pretty gruelling as it was only in a fast food restaurant but never the less passed with a fab McDonalds Floor Managers Certificate.

Pay reviews were regular but it was not a great payrise we are talking pence here and as the minimum wage went up the wages for existing employees didnt so on occassion you would find new employees only just on slightly less money it was annoying.

McDonalds is high on training and cleanliness but this all depends on your manager on shift there are lazy ones that have no idea what goes on from time to time and there are...
