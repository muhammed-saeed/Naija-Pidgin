McDonald&apos;s to put 10,000 apprentices on fast-food track to success

Burger chain to become UK&apos;s leading apprenticeship provider within two years after pilot scheme in 80 restaurants

The fast-food chain McDonald&apos;s says it will become the UK&apos;s largest apprenticeship provider within two years as it promises to offer 10,000 places a year from 2010.

The company hopes nearly one in seven of its workforce will soon be involved in preparing for an on-the-job qualification through &quot;shoulder-to-shoulder&quot; coaching, some classroom learning and online study. It will be equivalent to achieving five A-C grades at GCSE and will include developing young people&apos;s maths and English ability, teamwork and involvement in community projects, as well as training people how to cook burgers.

A trial at 80 restaurants is to be extended across all 1,200 in the UK, half of them franchises. Six thousand places will be available this year. The courses will be checked by the Ofsted inspectorate.

David Fairhurst, the senior vice-president and chief people officer for McDonald&apos;s in the UK, said he had no problem with the term McJob provided that it did not mean low-paid, low-dignity employment with no opportunities.

&quot;There is still the perception there but the gap [from reality] is not as big as it was and people are understanding a bit more about what the reality is about. For many young people we are a stepping stone on to other things.&quot;

Members of the restaurant crews stay on average for two and a half years, while managers typically have been with the company for 11. The apprenticeships would include working in the kitchens and at counters, writing reports and studying hygiene and nutrition, and might typically last a year.

The company&apos;s restaurants employ10,000 people a year who had never worked before. &quot;Apprenticeships will help give our employees the confidence and competence to do their jobs to the best of their ability … It is not just our people and our business that will benefit. Apprenticeships are also good news for the wider economy,&quot; Fairhurst said.

One of those involved in the trial, Alix Potts, has had three pay rises and two promotions in a year. Her success on the pilot scheme has landed her a trainee managership at the McDonald&apos;s in Sleaford, Lincolnshire.

After six years with the company, five as a part-timer working on the front or drive-through counters, she said: &quot;I am happy where I am and will try to make the best of things while I am at McDonalds. I am not sure what I want to do at the end of the day, but I have always been involved with the public.&quot;

Potts, 22, admitted: &quot;I didn&apos;t do very well at school and messed around in the fourth year. When I was taking GCSEs I did not do as much work as I should. I couldn&apos;t get higher than Cs.&quot;

While at McDonalds, she studied hairdressing at college and joined a local salon. &quot;I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as I thought I would.&quot; She left, went full-time with McDonald&apos;s last February and was soon on her apprenticeship, which she completed in about six months – quicker than average. She has since been helping induct new recruits to the restaurant.

&quot;My friends think McDonald&apos;s is really good,&quot; she said. &quot;They don&apos;t have a low perception. No one realised how far you could go.&quot;
