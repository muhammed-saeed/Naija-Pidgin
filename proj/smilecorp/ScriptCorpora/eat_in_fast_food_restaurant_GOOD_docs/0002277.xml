Faster Is Not Always Better–How Fast Food Effects the Environment
 August 18th, 2011 · 5:25 pm @ KatelynWalton   -  No Comments 
 Your tummy is rumbling and your cravings are kicking in. With people’s busy lives, they’re always on the go and they usually resort to fast-food restaurants for a quick meal. We’ve all heard about the unhealthy characteristics of french fries and double cheeseburgers from McDonald’s, Burger King, etc; but do you know why it’s so unhealthy? And have you ever wondered how devastating fast-food is, to not only your health and fitness, but the environment as well? Here are some facts about fast-food and what it does to the environment, so you can become more aware of this issue. And, perhaps, it will encourage you to pick the fruits and veggies instead.

Fast-Food is not really Food

It’s obvious that high calorie french fries and fattening burgers are unhealthy and can lead to weight gain. But, it’s mostly about what the fast-food is made out of that makes all the difference. Any synthetic chemical that is added to food leads to weight gain and health issues. The body cannot physically process the chemicals, and it turns into fat. And guess what…fast-food is loaded with chemical additives, such as aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG). Making the food itself is unhealthy, because there is no way that this stuff is remotely organic! According to the FDA Total Diet Study, fast-food hamburgers across the board contained 113 different pesticide residues. Ew!

 *It takes 51 days to digest fast-food chicken nuggets or french fries!! 

The Environment is Suffering from it too

So much packaging and waste comes from the fast-food joints. The bags, wrappers, napkins, boxes, Styrofoam containers, plastic-ware, etc; is the primary source of urban litter in the United States. While fast-food packaging counts for 20% of our litter, another 20% comes from packaging for chips, drinks, candy, and other snacks. Out of all the litter, Styrofoam is the most common food waste. Styrofoam is by far the worst litter around, since it takes at least 900 years for it to break down in a landfill! 

According to the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, the amount of food transported by road doubled between 1974 and 2005. That’s a lot of fuel and energy! A recent Hong Kong study shows that a fast-food restaurant making 4 hamburgers emits the same amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as driving a car for 1,000 miles! Yikes.

With all of the nasty chemicals in the food, the heavy load of litter, and sickening amounts of pollution, hopefully this has inspired you to not eat fast-food regularly, but instead think of it as an occasional treat. Your health, fitness, and environment are on the line!
