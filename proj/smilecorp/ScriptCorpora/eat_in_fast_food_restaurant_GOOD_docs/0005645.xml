Wanna feast on finger lickin’good fried chicken? Well, you probably can’t get it at KFC these days. But I’ll tell you where you can. Popeyes!

No, not the spinach-eating cartoon character. Not exactly. I’m referring to Popeyes , the world’s second largest fast food chain specialising in chicken!

But hey, if we’re talking about food quality, Popeyes trumps its biggest competitor any day. Not only are the chicken and fries tastier and crispier, they are less oily, too.

For the chicken flavours, you have the choice of New Orleans Spicy or Louisiana Mild. I haven’t had the chance to savour the buttermilk biscuits and mashed potatoes (they ran out), but I hear they are amazing!

Each time I eat the KFC fried or popcorn chicken, the breaded crispy skin is very thick and, frankly, not very crispy or appetising. After a while, I just feel like I am chewing on cardboard. Does anyone else feel the same way?

Popeyes’chicken is different; the skin is light, crispy and simply a joy to eat. What’s more, it retains that amazing crispiness even long after I’ve taken a hundred photos of it!

 

Just as satisfying are the French fries. They remain surprisingly crunchy even towards the end of the meal, golden brown with the wonderful flavours of Cajun spices.

Seriously, nothing turns me off more than munching on soggy fries. There’s really no excuse when they’re already soggy when you’ve only *just* ordered them off the counter. That’s McDonald’s and KFC I’m talking about.

 

While the restaurant was originally named after the fictional detective Jimmy“Popeye”Doyle in the movie, the French connection, Popeye the sailor eventually became the main character fronting the marketing efforts.

That’s also why you get to watch old Popeye’s cartoons while digging in! Very classic :) after Disney Naturally closed down, this is one other cartoon-themed eatery where parents can bring their kids.

Interesting titbit: the late founder Al Copeland amusingly claimed that he named the restaurant“Popeyes”because he was“too poor”to afford an apostrophe. Haha :)

 

I wish there were more Popeyes restaurants in Singapore besides the ones at Changi Airport and Singapore Flyer. For many people that need a quick fix of fried chicken, they have no choice but to head to the more ubiquitous KFC.

 Update : New outlets have opened! See below.

Better yet, throw in home delivery, too! I’m sure Popeye’s killer biceps can handle that.

I think/hope it’s only a matter of time before Popeyes restaurants start sprouting all over the island! Hopefully the standards would be consistent :)

Oh right. No wonder we didn’t get the biscuits or the mashed potatoes. I heard that not long ago, they would even run out of one or both chicken flavours! To play safe, we should all go there for lunch instead of dinner.

I went at about 1 plus on two consecutive Saturday afternoons. First time, they ran out of biscuits. Second time, both ran out. Let’s just hope for good luck then.

i still prefer kfc chicken better. I tried their chicken twice and was quite disappointed. I still prefer kfc chicken, esp at taka branch cos they are served hot. The fries are much nicer than kfc fries. I hate soggy fries. The popeye mashed potato’s sauce was watery and had not much of a taste. The biscuits are quite tasty though.

That’s surprising! While I have not eaten Popeyes’mashed potato before, I would think that the spices make it more tasty. Come to think of it, I have no complaints about KFC’s mashed potato. But the fries I get there are always soggy, and the coleslaw is just a weird and unsavory mess.

My friend says that it tastes just like any regular butter biscuits. But some people say that it’s actually soft inside. Makes me wonder what it’s really like! Hmm…

You’re right! I love chicken! As a matter of fact, I specially made a trip to Charco’s earlier this week after hearing your recommendation. Loved it! I have started recommending Charco’s to anyone who cares to listen :D

My review is coming up shortly. Thanks for the excellent recommendation! Keep them comin’!

I love Popeye’s! Their buttermilk biscuits are lovely, they’re warm and melt-in-your-mouth and perfect when paired with the strawberry jam provided! Their mashed potato and coleslaw are pretty good too. You must try them one day (:

Veron, thank you for this post. I love Popeyes Biscuits and will travel all the way to the airport just to eat them. I am looking forward to see them back again. I asked one of the staff and was told that the biscuits would be available in August….if all go well.

You are most welcome. I would think the Singapore Flyer is more accessible for some of us that don’t live in the East.

Does that mean the biscuits have been out of stock? That’s quite bizarre coming from a chain that’s called“Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits”!

I don’t know if the biscuits are out of stock now. However, during the last week of July, I was having cravings for the biscuit, and went to various places in the hope to try the biscuits, but all the three outlets in Singapore said that the biscuits (and the mashed potato) were not available.

I do hope that the biscuits are back. Popeyes is not likely to get my business without the biscuits. hehee…

The biscuits must be good then! I really wonder how they can run out of that and the mashed potatoes. It’s not like the ingredients are hard to find. Unless they make these two items exclusively out of Singapore before shipping them in.

That’s great news for all the Muslim fans! Thanks for the update! I’ve added back the Halal icon to Popeyes. Hmmm I wonder why I can’t find Popeyes on the Singapore Halal Directory .

I had popeyes chicken last night at T3. U know what ? The environment is so dirty, full of dirt. And the best things is the staff started to sweep the floor while we are eating. She is sweeping the dirt around us, from table to table. Can imagine how the dust fly into our foods and drinks. And when the customer sitted next to me complained to their supervisor, the staff didnt stop sweeping at all. How can they add the“pepper”to our food, it was so unhygenie.

the fries look peppery…then i noticed your‘cajun’spices’…reminds me of A&amp;W curlies. still, sitting on the fence for this one…

definitely won’t make a trip to century square or the flyer for this. prolly before my next flight at the airport. cold mushroom swiss double at BK tastes like sock anyway. so bad i need to wash it down at Harry’s.

The first time I tried Popeye is at Singapore Flyers. I forget what i ordered from them cos the only thing i can remember is their Mashed Potato, simply love the taste. The potato and the gravy is so tasty and there are also a little bit of bacon/meat in the gravy! Highly recommended, must try!

So far i only know that there are 2 outlets in Singapore, Singapore Flyers and Changi Airport T3. Anyone know there’s any other outlets?

you guys will be glad to know that there are more outlets sprouting this month alone, 1 in Ang Mo Kio Jubilee and 1 in Toa Payoh Jubilee. AMK will be opened in another 10-12 days and TP will be opened slightly later, but, this month too, if all goes well.
next year, another 5/6 more outlets at least in the neighbourhood/town area.

Hi all,

I’m a huge fan of Popeyes Chicken resturant…simply loves the chicken, even the breast meat is juicy. I reall wonder how they make it so yummy!!

The mashed is even better if u mix in the gravy, just stir it in together..then it just dissolves in the mouth. YUM!!!

The chicken at popeyes may not be the best. However their mashed potatoes are fantastic. It is just different from the usual chicken stock taste in most mashed potatoes
