Abstract:

A solid food product is molded in a mold cavity and is thereafter packaged
 in the mold cavity. The mold cavity is formed in a sheet and includes a
 side wall which extends from the sheet and a bottom wall which includes
 an inverting portion which extends from said side wall and a central
 portion. The central potion of the bottom wall includes a plurality of
 ridges which form a decorative design. A liquid food product is
 introduced into the mold cavity and allowed to solidify to form a molded
 solid food product. The central portion of the bottom wall is thereafter
 pushed into the mold cavity to invert said inverting potion and to push
 the molded food product away from the central portion of the bottom wall.
 The molded food product includes ridges which correspond to the ridges in
 the bottom wall of the mold cavity. A lid is attached to the sheet to
 enclose and package the molded food product within the mold cavity.

Description:

 BACKGROUND 

 [0001] This invention relates to molded food products, and, more
 particularly, to a package for a molded food product which is used to
 mold the food product and subsequently to package the food product.

 [0002] Many food products are molded with a decorative design on the outer
 surface thereof. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,183,101, 3,317,326,
 3,398,000, 3,798,335, 3,865,953, 3,896,239, 3,901,000, and 3,976,796
 describe butter or margarine products with an embossed or raised design
 on the upper surface. The butter or margarine can be quarter pound or
 larger bulk servings or can be smaller pats which are sized for
 individual servings. Many other food products may be molded with a
 decorative design, for example, chocolate and cheese.

 [0003] U.S. Pat. No. 3,798,335 describes a process for filling molds with
 liquid butter or margarine. In accordance with current practice, after
 the molds are filled, the butter or margarine is frozen. The frozen
 product is removed from the mold by &quot;punching&quot; or pressing the outside of
 the mold cavity so that the mold is turned inside out and the frozen
 product is ejected or dispensed onto a tray or plastic sheet.

 [0004] The ejected embossed butter or margarine pats can be packaged for
 shipping to the customer in several ways. Individual pats can be loaded
 into a tray of the type which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,239.
 Alternatively, after the embossed pats are ejected onto a tray, a package
 with pockets for the pats can be placed over the pats. The tray is then
 inverted to drop the pats into the pockets, and a lid or cover can be
 positioned over the pats.

 [0005] Individual embossed pats can also be loaded into individual
 packages. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,865,953, 3,901,000, and
 3,976,796. Butterball Farms, Inc. of Grand Rapids, Mich. markets
 individual pats in clear plastic packages called &quot;Tip-Out&quot; packs. Each
 pat is individually sealed in a pocket in a plastic package, and the
 pocket is covered by a plastic film. At the point of consumption, the
 consumer peels off the film and tips out the pat, embossed side up.

 [0006] The foregoing packaging processes suffer from a number of
 disadvantages. For Example: [0007] The molds are used once and are
 disposed of after the pats are removed. [0008] The process for punching
 out the pats and inserting them into a package is labor intensive and
 expensive. [0009] If the pats become too warm, the pats can fall
 prematurely from the molds. [0010] Locating the molds before ejecting the
 pats and locating the packages over the pats is done by eye by the
 operator and may be inaccurate.

 [0011] In one current practice the plastic tray which is used to mold
 multiple pats of butter or margarine is also used to ship the pats after
 they are frozen. The mold cavities may be vacuum formed in thin plastic
 film, e.g., PETG, which is about 0.0025 inch thick. Trays which are used
 to mold and ship the pats are intended to be used by the institutional
 customer which purchases the pats, for example, a restaurant. Such a
 customer punches out the pats onto a plate in a kitchen or preparation
 area and then places individual pats onto serving plates for the
 consumer, for example, a restaurant patron.

 [0012] This process also suffers from a number of disadvantages: [0013] The bottoms of the mold pockets of the package are concave, and the
 package may be somewhat unstable when it rests on the concave pockets. [0014] The pats are not loose in the package and must be ejected after
 shipment. [0015] The pats must be within a certain temperature range in
 order to be ejected cleanly, and proper ejection technique must be
 followed. Many institutional customers do not exercise proper temperature
 control and/or ejection techniques, and pats can be damaged or ruined
 during ejection. [0016] The package contains multiple pats and is not used
 for individual servings.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

 [0017] In accordance with the invention, a mold cavity both molds the food
 product and forms the package for the product. The mold cavity is formed
 from a plastic sheet and includes a side wall and a bottom wall. The
 bottom wall includes ridges or peaks and valleys which form the
 decorative design on the product. The bottom wall is constructed so that
 it can be pushed into the mold cavity after the product is molded to
 eject the product from the mold cavity. Preferably, the bottom wall
 includes a generally frusto-conical inverting portion and a central
 portion which includes the peaks and valleys. The pushing step inverts
 the inverting portion as the central portion moves into the mold cavity.
 The bottom wall advantageously remains in the pushed-in condition when
 the mold cavity serves as the package.

 [0018] Product such as liquid butter or margarine is dispensed into the
 mold cavity and then solidified by refrigerating or freezing. After the
 product is solidified, the bottom wall of the mold cavity is pushed in or
 punched so that the bottom wall moves into the mold cavity and the
 product is released from the surface of the mold cavity. The bottom wall
 remains in its punched condition, and the pat can sit freely on the
 bottom wall. A thin plastic film or lid is attached to the sheet to
 enclose the product for shipping. Each mold cavity includes a single
 product.

 [0019] The inventive package and process provides several advantages over
 the prior art: [0020] The disposable mold film is eliminated, saving the
 cost of purchasing, handling, and disposing of the film. [0021] The
 punching operation is performed at the factory using proper technique and
 under proper temperature conditions. [0022] The step of transferring the
 products from the molds into separate packages is eliminated,
 significantly reducing production labor. [0023] The package is molded with
 the decorative design, substantially enhancing its outside appearance. [0024] The punched-in bottom wall of the mold cavity provides a more
 stable support if the package is supported by the bottom wall. [0025] The
 expense of separate containers or trays is eliminated.

 [0026] The mold/package can be formed individually so that each package
 holds a single product. Alternatively, multiple molds can be formed in a
 single sheet of material. After the products are molded and frozen, each
 individual mold/package can be cut from the sheet and shipped as an
 individual package with a single product, or the entire sheet can be
 shipped with multiple products.

 DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS 

 [0048] FIG. 1 illustrates an embossed food product 10. The particular food
 product is a butter pat which is sized as an individual serving, for
 example, about 0.2 ounce. However, the invention is suitable for use with
 other food products, for example, margarine, chocolate, cheese, and the
 like, and other sizes, for example, 1/4 pound or larger.

 [0049] The pat 10 is generally round and includes a bottom surface on which
 the pat rests, a frusto-conical side surface 11, and a top surface 12. A
 design 13 is embossed or raised from the top surface. The particular
 design illustrated is the letter &quot;m,&quot; but the designs are unlimited.

 [0050] Although the invention is particularly suitable for products with an
 embossed or raised design, the invention can also be used with products
 having a lowered or grooved or engraved design on the top surface or a
 combination embossed and engraved design.

 [0051] FIGS. 2-4 illustrate the mold/container 15 for the pat 10. The mold
 is formed from a plastic sheet having a thickness within the range of
 about 0.008 to about 0.025 inch. Suitable plastics include polystyrene,
 oriented polystyrene (OPS), styrene butadiene styrene (SBS), PET, and
 PETG. One specific embodiment was formed from PETG having a thickness of
 0.015 inch.

 [0052] The mold 15 includes a generally flat flange 16 and a generally
 cup-shaped pocket or cavity 17 which is formed by a frusto-conical side
 wall 18 and a bottom wall 19. The side wall can also be a portion of a
 sphere or some other suitable shape, and the bottom wall can be a
 continuation of the side wall. The bottom wall is shown in FIGS. 2-4 in
 its pushed-in condition which it assumes after the molded product is
 ejected from the mold and while it functions as a container for the
 molded product. The cavity is formed in the plastic sheet by vacuum
 forming, e.g., plug assist vacuum forming, or other suitable methods.

 [0053] The bottom wall 19 includes a generally frusto-conical inverting
 portion 20 and a generally dome-shaped central portion 21. The inverting
 portion 20 extends inwardly and upwardly from the bottom edge 22 of the
 side wall to a circular edge 23 which joins the inverting portion 20 and
 the central portion 21. The central portion 21 is convexly shaped toward
 the bottom edge 22 and concavely shaped toward the flange 16. Recesses or
 ridges 24 extend downwardly from the central portion for molding the
 embossed design 13 on the product. As described in the foregoing United
 States patents, the central portion could be formed with a variety of
 upwardly or downwardly extending recesses, ridges, peaks, and/or valleys
 for molding any desired embossed and/or engraved design on the product.
 The term &quot;ridges&quot; as used herein broadly refers to any variation in the
 surface which produces a design on the product.

 [0054] The inverting portion 20 can be inverted back and forth between its
 pushed-in or inverted position illustrated in FIG. 4 and its pushed-out
 or non-inverted position illustrated in FIG. 5. When the mold 15 is
 originally formed, the bottom wall has the shape shown in FIG. 5. The
 original or as-molded position of the inverting portion 20 is thus the
 non-inverted position of FIG. 5. The inverting portion can be moved in
 either direction by exerting an appropriately directed pushing or pulling
 force on the inverting portion and/or the central portion 21.

 [0055] In the preferred embodiment, the inverting portion 20 snaps, or
 moves &quot;over-center,&quot; when it moves between the non-inverted or pushed-out
 position of FIG. 5 and the inverted or pushed-in position of FIG. 4. It
 is believed that the over-center movement is accommodated by outward
 flexing of the frusto-conical side wall 18, and/or flexing of the
 inverting portion 20, and/or flexing of the central portion 21 of the
 bottom wall. As a result of the over-center movement of the inverting
 portion 20 and the rigidity and resilience of the mold material, the
 inverting portion will remain in its pushed-out or pushed-in condition
 until it is forcibly moved to the other position.

 [0056] The material of the mold has sufficient flexibility to permit the
 over-center movement of the inverting portion and also has sufficient
 resilience and rigidity so that the inverting portion and the central
 portion of the bottom wall will retain either the pushed-in or pushed-out
 position. In both the pushed-in and pushed-out condition, the inverting
 portion 20 is generally frusto-conical in shape. The resilient side wall
 18 returns to its original position after the inverting portion moves
 over center.

 [0057] FIG. 5 illustrates the mold with the bottom wall in its non-inverted
 or pushed-out condition. The frusto-conical inverting portion 20 extends
 generally radially outwardly and preferably slightly downwardly from the
 bottom edge 22 of the side wall 18 to the edge 23 of the central portion
 21.

 [0058] When the mold is in the non-inverted or pushed-out configuration of
 FIG. 5, the mold cavity is filled with a liquid food product 27. If the
 product is butter or margarine, the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No.
 3,798,335 is advantageously used. The top surface 28 of the filled
 product is below the flange 16 so that the mold can later serve as a
 container when the mold is in its pushed-in configuration.

 [0059] After filling, the product is allowed to solidify in the mold. If
 the product is butter or margarine, the product is refrigerated or
 frozen, preferably frozen. Other food products can be solidified at
 higher temperatures, for example, room temperature.

 [0060] FIG. 6 illustrates the molded, solid food product 10 being ejected
 from the mold. A punching or pushing force 30 is applied to the bottom
 wall 19 to move the central portion 21 upwardly and to invert the
 inverting portion 20. The punching or pushing force may be exerted by a
 finger or thumb or may be exerted mechanically. The punching or pushing
 force is preferably exerted on the inverting portion 20 or at the edge 23
 between the inverting portion 20 and the central portion 21 of the bottom
 wall.

 [0061] As the central portion 21 moves upwardly and the inverting portion
 20 inverts, the product 10 is moved away from the central portion 21 and
 is ejected from the ridges or recesses 24 of the mold. If the temperature
 of the food product is within an appropriate range, depending upon the
 nature of the product, the product will be ejected with the design 13
 intact. The ejection of the product 10 from the mold is exaggerated in
 FIG. 6 for clarity of illustration. The product 10 need not be completely
 ejected from the mold as shown in FIG. 6. The product is merely pushed
 upwardly sufficiently to remove the embossed design 13 from the
 ridges/recesses 24 in the bottom wall of the mold.

 [0062] Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, after the molded food product 10 is
 ejected from the mold, the food product remains in, or is reinserted
 into, the mold while the mold remains in its pushed-in condition. The top
 surface 12 of the food product is supported by the edge 23 between the
 inverting portion 20 and the central portion 21 so that the embossed
 design 13 on the food product is spaced from the recesses/ridges 24 of
 the mold. The bottom surface 32 of the molded food product is spaced
 below the flange 16. The food product is sealed within the mold by a lid,
 cover, sheet, or film 33 which is removably attached to the flange 16,
 preferably by adhesive. The lid is advantageously formed from a plastic
 film such as DuPont&apos;s 50RL42 having a thickness of about 56 gauge.

 [0063] The sealed package 34 comprising the mold 15 and the food product 10
 can then be stored for later shipment to a customer. If the food product
 is butter or margarine, the package is preferably stored in a
 refrigerator or freezer and shipped in an insulated container which will
 maintain the product at the desired temperature.

 [0064] The package can be shipped by orienting the package with either the
 bottom wall 19 down or the lid 33 down. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 8, when
 the mold is in its pushed-in position, the concave central portion 21 and
 the ridges 24 are preferably positioned at or above the bottom edge 22 of
 the side wall 18 so that the package is supported in a stable manner by
 the circular bottom edge 22. The molded food product is supported loosely
 within the cavity or pocket of the package by the pushed-in bottom wall
 19, preferably by the circular edge 23.

 [0065] The package 34 contains a single food product and is particularly
 suitable for individual sized servings, for example, a 0.2 ounce butter
 pat. However, the package can also be used for larger sizes of food
 products. Multiple packages 34 can be packaged within a shipping carton
 for shipment to a customer, for example, a fast food restaurant. The
 restaurant can distribute individual unopened packages 34 to the
 restaurant patrons. The package 34 is preferably served to the patron
 with the bottom wall 19 of the package facing up so that the ridges or
 recesses 24 present an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The patron
 opens the package by peeling the lid away from the flange 16, and tips
 the product onto a plate or the like so that the embossed design 13 faces
 upwardly.

 [0066] Although the particular bottom wall 19 of the mold which is
 illustrated in the drawings includes an inverting portion 20, other ways
 of inverting the bottom wall and ejecting the molded food product can be
 used. For example, the entire bottom wall can be dome-shaped or concavely
 curved downwardly away from the flange 16. The concave bottom wall can be
 inverted or reversed by pushing the bottom wall into an inverted convex
 shape which curves upwardly toward the flange 16.

 [0067] In the preferred embodiment, molds 15 are used individually to
 package the molded food product. However, multiple molds could be formed
 in a single sheet for molding multiple food products. The sheet could
 then be cut into individual molds for packaging the food products, or the
 sheet could remain intact for packaging multiple food products.

 [0068] A sheet containing multiple mold cavities may advantageously be
 punched in-line in a continuous process as the sheet is moved out of a
 freezer. The sheet may be advanced from the freezer to a punching station
 where mechanical punches eject multiple food products from multiple mold
 cavities. A plate may be positioned above the mold cavities to prevent
 the food products from being ejected completely out of the mold cavities.
 The sheet of mold cavities may thereafter be advanced to a sealing
 station which applies a lid or cover to the mold cavities to seal the
 food products.

 [0069] FIGS. 9 and 10 illustrate an eight cavity mold 40 for molding eight
 embossed food products such as butter or margarine pats. The eight cavity
 mold 40 includes eight mold cavities 41, and each individual mold cavity
 41 is formed is substantially the same way as the mold 15. The eight
 cavity mold 40 is advantageously plug assist vacuum formed from a sheet
 42 of PETG having a thickness of 0.015 inch. Similar molds can be made
 with any desired number of mold cavities, e.g., 20, 40, 60, etc. A
 greater number of mold cavities facilitates commercial production and
 packaging of the molded food products.

 [0070] FIG. 11 illustrates one of the molds 41 of the eight cavity mold 40.
 Each mold 41 includes a frusto-conical side wall 43, and a bottom wall
 44. The bottom wall includes a frusto-conical inverting portion 45 and a
 generally dome-shaped central portion 46. The central portion 46 includes
 recesses or ridges 47 for molding an embossed design on the food product.

 [0071] Referring to FIG. 12, the frusto-conical inverting portion 45
 extends downwardly and inwardly from an annular shoulder 50 which extends
 inwardly from the frusto-conical side wall 43. A second inwardly
 extending annular shoulder 51 extends inwardly from the inverting portion
 45 to the dome-shaped central portion 46.

 [0072] FIGS. 13-15 illustrate a mechanical punch fixture 54 for
 mechanically inverting or punching the eight bottom walls 44 of the eight
 molds 41 of the eight cavity mold 40. During the punching step, the
 frusto-conical side wall 43 of each of the molds 41 is supported by a
 locator block 56.

 [0073] Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, the locator block 56 includes eight
 openings 57, one for each of the molds 41. Each opening 57 is provided by
 a frusto-conical surface 58 which has substantially the same shape as the
 frusto-conical side walls 43 of the molds 41. In the embodiment
 illustrated, each surface 58 is angled at 10 degrees from the vertical
 axis 59 of the opening. The height of the locator block is less than the
 height of the side walls 43 of the molds 41 so that the upper portion of
 each side wall extends slightly above the top of the locator block as
 illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15. The locator block is advantageously
 formed from Delrin.

 [0074] The punch fixture 54 includes a base plate 61 for supporting the
 locator block 56 and a top plate 62 which is supported by four vertical
 rods 63. The rods may be attached to the plates 61 and 62 by screws. A
 punch plate 64 is slidably mounted on the rods 63 and can be reciprocated
 by a piston 65 which extends vertically through the top plate 62. The
 upper end of the piston 65 is slidably mounted in a bushing 66. A handle
 67 is pivotally mounted on a support bracket 68 which is mounted on the
 top plate 62. A link 69 is pivotally connected to the handle 67 and the
 piston 65 so that pivoting movement of the handle reciprocates the piston
 65 and the punch plate 64.

 [0075] Although the punch plate 64 is manually reciprocated by the handle
 67, other conventional and well known devices for mechanically
 reciprocating the punch plate can be used. For example, the punch plate
 can be reciprocated by a hydraulic cylinder and piston, a ball screw
 actuator, or the like.

 [0076] Eight punches 71 are mounted on the punch plate 64 in alignment with
 the openings 57 in the locator block 56. Referring to FIGS. 16-18, each
 punch 71 includes a bottom end 72 which is provided with a frusto-conical
 side wall 73 and a cylindrical counterbore 74 which extends upwardly from
 the bottom end. The side wall 73 and the cylindrical side surface 75 of
 the counterbore form a circular bottom edge 76. A bolt opening 77 extends
 through the top of the punch for attaching the punch to the punch plate
 64.

 [0077] In one specific embodiment, the diameter of the counterbore 74 was
 1.0 inch, and the angle of the frusto-conical side wall 73 relative to
 the vertical was 41 degrees. As will be explained more fully hereinafter,
 the diameter of the bottom edge 76 of each punch is sized to engage the
 inverting portion 45 of one of the molds 41

 [0078] The molds 41 are filled with food product as previously described
 with respect to the mold 15, and the product is allowed to solidify,
 e.g., by freezing. The eight cavity mold 40 is then placed in the locator
 block 56 so that the embossed bottom walls 44 of the molds 41 extend
 upwardly through the openings 57 in the locator block and the side walls
 43 of the molds 41 are supported on the outside by the surfaces 58 of the
 openings 57 in the locator block.

 [0079] The molds 41 are then punched by lowering the punch plate 64 and the
 punches 71 so that the circular bottom edges 76 of the punches engage the
 inverting portions 45 of the molds 41. As the punches continue downward,
 the inverting portions 45 are moved over-center from their pushed-out
 condition illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12 to their pushed-in condition
 (see FIGS. 4 and 6). The portions of the side walls 43 of the molds which
 extend upwardly beyond the locator block 56 flex outwardly to permit the
 over-center movement of the inverting portions. As the inverting portions
 45 invert or move downward, the food products within the molds 41 are
 ejected from the molds onto the base plate 61. The food products are then
 returned to the pushed-in molds, and a lid is secured to the sheet 42
 over the food products to seal the food products within the molds as
 previously described with respect to FIGS. 6-8.

 [0080] If desired, the lid can be attached to the sheet 42 before the
 products are punched from the molds to eliminate the labor of replacing
 the products in the molds. There is sufficient space in the molds between
 the sheet and the pushed-in position of the top of the molds to allow for
 ejection of the products after attaching the lid.

 [0081] The mold 40 and the products which are packaged within the molds 41
 can then be stored and shipped as previously described. Alternatively,
 individual molds 41 and the products therein, or a strip of molds 41 and
 products therein, can be cut from the mold 40.

 [0082] The molds 41 are oriented in FIGS. 13-15 so that the bottom walls 44
 face upwardly and are punched downwardly. However, the punch fixture can
 also be arranged so that the bottom walls are punched upwardly as
 illustrated in FIG. 6.

 [0083] While in the foregoing specification a detailed description of
 specific embodiments was set forth for the purpose of illustration, it
 will be understood that many of the details described herein may be
 varied considerably by those skilled in the art without departing from
 the spirit and scope of the invention.
