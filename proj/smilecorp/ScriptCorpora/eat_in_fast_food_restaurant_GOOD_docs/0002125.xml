Boston - Long Wharf

See fish. Eat fish. Enjoy ocean-side dining just steps from the New England Aquarium. Our restaurant couldn’t be more convenient to the Financial District, Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall and waterfront hotels such as the Boston Harbor Hotel, Marriott and Intercontinental. Long Wharf is home port for many cruise ships and whale watches, while Duck Tours and Old Town Trolleys see the sights and then make a stop for seafood right outside our door.   

We think a visit to Boston must include a meal at Legal Sea Foods. If you’re looking for some fun, eat at our food bar where you’ll see what’s cooking in our open kitchen. Or, during the warmer months, dine in our patio if you opt for the fresh seafood and fresh air combo. Our in-restaurant aquarium and lobster tank keep kids entertained.
