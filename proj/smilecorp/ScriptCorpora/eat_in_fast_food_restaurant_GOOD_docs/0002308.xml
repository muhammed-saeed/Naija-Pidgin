Discharged in Oregon
 Tags: apparently , back , basically , complicated , discharged , drive , employer , employment , fired , food , labor , law , oregon I was fired today by my employer. The reason is kind of long and complicated. Basically, I worked in a fast food place in the back drive. Apparently, even with me being cheerful and smiling and polite and everything, there were enough people that filed complaints against me that I was suspended last month for three days. I started work again, monitoring every little word that came out of my mouth. Apparently a few more customers complained and I was told I would have to do front counter. I&apos;m not a big huge people person and being forced to stand there for 8 hours at a time, dealing with customers that were worse than the ones in drive-thru started taking it&apos;s toll on me the past couple days. When there were NO CUSTOMERS around, I would allow my smile to drop while I was cleaning things. Yesterday my employer came in a few minutes after I had had to deal with a particularly horrible customer. The customer had wanted to know why we didn&apos;t have a pot of coffee sitting out on the counter so he could fill his own cup up. I told him in a polite tone that the reason the coffee pots were no longer put out where the customer could access them was because of people bumping them and burning themselves, and then there were also people that would come into the store with a cup that didn&apos;t come from our store, fill said cup up with coffee, and walk out without paying for it. They would do this while we were dealing with other customers. He was displeased with my answer and stormed out of the restaurant. My employer came in while I was bagging orders for Drive-Thru and kept pestering me about what was wrong. She didn&apos;t seem to get that I didn&apos;t really want to talk about it when I kept saying,&quot;I&apos;m fine, Nothing&apos;s wrong.&quot;When I&apos;m upset, I don&apos;t like to talk about what made me upset until I have calmed down and thought things through. She knew this, yet she still told them to send me home and cover the rest of my hours for this week. This was because she had been told that I was throwing a fit because I was up on counter, which was not true. I went in this morning to find out whether I still had a job or not and my employer didn&apos;t even have the decency to come out of her own office to let me know herself that I was discharged. She made one of the lesser managers come out and relay the message for her. I&apos;m unsure as to whether this was a wrongful firing or not, but my family says I should pursue questioning it and find out if there is something I could do. 3 Comments under it.

 Post a Comment Now. Comments Wed, 13 Aug 2008 16:46:00 GMT (1) No, this is not an illegal firing. A wrongful termination does not mean that you were fired for something you did not do; it means that a specific law exists which prohibits the employer from firing you for the reason they did. Thu, 14 Aug 2008 08:23:00 GMT (2) If you don&apos;t like dealing with people, a job in fast food or the service industry is not for you. Your employer is not required to ignore multiple displeased customers. Whether you think they had good cause to be displeased is beside the point. If your employer asks you for an explanation regarding an unhappy customer or a bad attitude, you give it. They don&apos;t have to wait around until you feel like answering them. If they see you copping an attitude after being asked to perform a duty that is part of the job and you don&apos;t tell them otherwise, they are allowed to draw their own conclusions. Wed, 13 Aug 2008 14:16:00 GMT (3) Nothing you stated in your post could be considered&quot;illegal&quot;. Most employment is at-will meaning they can fire you for any reason or no reason at all. The only exemption would be if you had a CBA or contract.

If you&apos;re not a people person, you honestly shouldn&apos;t be working in a fast-food/restaurant industry.
