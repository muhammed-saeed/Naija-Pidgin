Foods Bad for Pregnant Women: French Fries
 Aug 17th, 2011 by Dr. Cate . 
 The cigarette versus the French fry: 

 

 

 
 
Fries Contain Oxidized Fats, Cigarettes Oxidize Your Tissues: Who Wins the Prize for Harming Babies? (Artwork by Dan Shanahan)
 
 
 
 Which is worse while pregnant? 
 
If you’re an expecting mom, you probably already know not to smoke. But did you know that eating French fries from a fast food restaurant are dangerous for baby too?
 
While you may know that the carcinogens inhaled during smoking have been shown to put you and your baby at risk during and after pregnancy, you probably don’t know that the trans fats and other distorted molecules in a frying vat have been shown to put you and baby at risk as well.
 
So which is worse, the cigarette or the fry?
 
Cigarette smoking can cause fetal growth retardation, research shows. This translates into babies being born underweight and often too weak to breastfeed.
 
French fries, full of deformed (the technical term is“peroxidized”) fat molecules, may cause pre-eclampsia , a condition in which mom’s body begins to reject the placenta, which raises her blood pressure and can lead to premature delivery.
 
When you smoke during pregnancy, the likelihood of your child having asthma increase significantly. And the chances of your grandchild having asthma go up even more.
 
 When you eat French fries, the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fries (even in supposedly trans-free restaurants) interact with your DNA and your baby’s. But since many of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in French fries are oxidized and distorted, they interact with DNA in a bad way, interfering with cell division and altering growth. 

 Can this cause birth defects? Pregnant rats fed high-trans diets give birth to offspring riddled with problems—abnormal limbs, tumors, malformed organs, and worse. Accumulating research also suggests a strong link between oxidized fats and psychiatric disorders including the entire spectrum of autistic diseases.
 
Expectant Parents Should Be Familiar with the Concept of“Oxidative Stress”~ Autism Researcher Woody R. McGinnis, MD
 
So which wins the nasty prize? Which of these two should all pregnant women avoid?
 
The answer is both. If you’re hoping to have the healthiest baby you can, you must do your best to stay far away from cigarettes and the noxious, reheated vegetable oils used for deep fat frying.
 
Brain Connectivity Imaging Shows Abnormal, Asymmetric Pathways in Autistic Children. Oxidized fats disrupting growth may be the cause.
 
It’s hard—really hard—to quit smoking. And for some, it’s even harder to rethink a lifetime of eating habits. But to give your child the best shot at growing up healthy, you have to try.
 
First, the smoking: Start by calling your insurance plan and telling them you want to quit and ask what resources they have for you.One thing you don’t have to do is try to do it alone.
 
Now, for the fries: That craving for salty and fatty food is natural. Protein-rich foods have a salty taste, which MSG (in fast-food fries) mimics. And fatty foods are the building blocks of baby’s brain, which normally weighs nearly a pound at birth (out of a total of seven). But the unnatural fats in fast food fries won’t do the job.
 
 Redirect your cravings away from junk food fixes and give your body, and your growing baby, what they’re really asking for. 

 Try tossing some thin-sliced potatoes coated in olive oil into the roasting pan when baking a whole chicken. Or better yet, because carbs can lead to metabolic diseases like gestational diabetes, roast your favorite veggies in the tray right with the chicken. Eat real cheese, preferably unpasteurized and organic. Have a real, fermented pickle, like Bubbies, to satisfy your need for salt.
 
Make real foods a habit, instead of fries and cigarettes. Your baby will thank you.

Dr. Cate,
Quick question–does this apply to fried meats as well? I am pregnant now, and crave buffalo wings and fried meatballs only. French fries make me sick when i’m pregnant. Should I stay away from fried buffalo wings given what you wrote above, or oxidized fats are only from vegetable oils?
Thanks!
Tina

Sharing. Potatoes gently crisped in duck fat are a wonderful thing.

As I continue to learn more about nutrition (your book was great by the way), I’ve become more and more disappointed with the public’s inability to recognize low-quality food as being detrimental to health in the same way cigarettes or drugs can be. Everywhere you look there’s angry parents protesting against alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and other drugs, then turning around and feeding their kids this garbage.
 Reply Dr. Cate says: August 19, 2011 at 3:52 am 
Tina, the oxidized fats come from the frying oil, not the potatoes. So if you can’t find Buffalo wings from a restaurant that uses a healthy oil or fat (i.e. not canola, corn, etc.–see Chapter 7 of DN or Food Rules for complete details), then you should make‘em right. Anyone have any recipes for TIna?
 Reply Tina says: August 19, 2011 at 10:20 am 
Josh, that is such a great point that you make. As a pregnant lady, I bet if I ordered a glass of wine at a restaurant, I’d get scolded by the waiter, but no one would blink an eye if I walked into a McDonald’s and ordered a supersized #3.

Anyway, I frequent Chipotle often, as I work right near one. Reading Deep Nutrition really had me questioning everything I put into my mouth. One thing I’m concerned about recently is the amount of MSG in foods as well. So I sent an email to Chipotle asking if they use MSG. This is the response I got. Dr. Cate, my question for you is whether or not I should be concered with the glutamate in the cheese and protein. I’m not sure what this means, and I don’t have a science degree to figure it out!
Here it is:

Tina,

Thanks for taking the time to write to us. We do not use any MSG in any of our foods. However, many foods have naturally occurring glutamic acid, an amino acid within a protein. Glutamic acid can be “free” of the protein and in the form of glutamates, the salt or anions of glutamic acid. “Free” glutamates can be naturally found in tomatoes, cheese and dairy foods, meats, and protein-rich foods. Our food is definitely protein-rich and has naturally occurring “free” glutamates. Again though, we do not use MSG or any MSG-related ingredients in our food or seasonings. We also do not use ingredients such as natural flavors/flavorings, autolyzed yeast extracts, and hydrolyzed proteins – or other things that are highly processed specifically to create free glutamates to enhance flavor.

I hope this helps, however, please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns (and, congratulations from all of us on your pregnancy too).

Tina,
They sure gave you an in-depth response, sounds like a good company and a good product. I’d buy it. Bottom line: Dont worry about naturally occurring free amino acids present in whole foods, they’re totally okay and actually as an amino acid it’s good for you! If you ever want to get a better handle on this surprisingly complex topic, we do explain what sorts of Glutamate to avoid, and why, in Food Rules. Contrats also, for taking this business of nutrition seriously. I have no doubt that your children will benefit from your thoroughness.
 Reply Tina says: September 2, 2011 at 12:08 pm 
Thanks Dr. Cate. I definitely want my children to grow up with the healthiest food. I wanted to post this new company that I discovered in NYC called Freshocracy–they deliver local produce and meats to your house and give you the recipes to make the healthy meals. I was wondering what you thought about it. I’m looking forward to trying it out. Here is their website.
 http://freshocracy.com/ 
 Reply Dr. Cate says: September 4, 2011 at 6:33 am 
Tina
Freshocracy looks like a fantastic resource. AND they offer good quality meats, which I suspect are super duper hard to come by in a place like Manhattan. I hope they are also affordable. My secret theory is that the whole anti-red-meat propaganda publishing/media industry, which is based in Manhattan, exists to justify the choices of those who care about animals but can’t afford $30 per pound for a decent steak. So they just put on the blinders, pretend they’re not missing out, and publish another fiction book about the made up benefits of plant based diets.
 Reply Tina says: September 8, 2011 at 9:24 am 
Dr. Cate,
That’s a great point! I was just telling a co-worker today that it seems that Manhattan is filled with vegetarians and vegans, that it’s becoming harder for me to avoid soy products (i’m allergic)! Anyway, I am definitely going to join Freshocracy. I’ll keep you posted. Oh, and can I make a request–can you do a post on cellulite? I am pretty thin (size 2/4 when not pregnant), and struggle with this on my thighs. After I have this baby, my goal is to get rid of it. I read both of your books, but was hoping you could do a post on how to get rid of it!
Thanks!
Tina

Good idea on the cellulite post! I will put that on my to-do list.

Hi Dr. Cate,
I just finished Deep Nutrition and want to say thank you for bring this work to us. I also have a question about what to drink (other than raw milk, when we can get it). I like either hot or iced green tea but I add a little Stevia for a sweetner. Is it ok to add Stevia to beverages?
 Reply 
 Dr. Cate says: November 1, 2011 at 9:18 am 
Linda
Stevia won’t raise your blood sugar but it can raise your insulin level, and insulin is the enemy of fat loss. Also, because stevia tastes sweet it keeps your taste buds‘hooked’on sweetness and may prevent your palate from opening up to the natural sweetness present in so many foods.

Dear Dr. Cate,

On August 19th of this discussion thread, there was some discussion of Chipotle restaurant. I am (was) a long-time fan of them, until I discovered that they use ALOT of soybean oil. Actually, you can go to their website and look at their“special diet information”page, where you will see that almost everything they offer (except the carnitas, fresh salsa, and dairy) contains soy.

I actually wrote them a letter to tell them about my concern over their use of soy, and I’ve given their response below. I haven’t yet responded to them, since I don’t really know how to tell them that their solution sounds just as bad as what they are doing now. Really, I’m tempted to just ask them to PLEASE read‘Deep Nutrition’. They do really seem to be a very ethical and conscientious company, so maybe they would actually pay attention to you.

Kathy,

Thanks for taking the time to write to us. We appreciate your concerns about soy oil. So you know, we have spent some time exploring alternative oils. Unfortunately, peanut oil might possibly have as many or more people allergic to it than soy. We have considered coconut oil in the past and have tried it in a few of our restaurants. We have also explored sunflower oil as an option and we are looking at switching out our fryer oil to sunflower at some point, but that change hasn’t happened yet.

Unfortunately, our food system is not perfect and neither are we. We wish we were, but we are the only restaurant chain committed to improving the ways in which we source our foods. There are many things we feel need to be changed with our current food system. We will always work to improve the way we source our foods and certainly our oil is something we’ll continue to look into. Again, I’m sorry we aren’t there yet, but I hope you’ll have patience with us in the meantime.

We appreciate your feedback with regards to this subject and hope that we’ll see you and your husband again soon.

Sincerely,

Louisa

Ok, there’s my two cents about Chipotle. If anything changes with their use of soy (and other dangerous oils), I will be sure to post it.

HI Kathy

Thanks for the follow up. It would be almost too good to be true if they’d just use old fashioned real fats, like Lard from those piggies they’ve pictured on their web site, but if you can get me the ear of someone who would listen to an MD about oils, I’d be happy to speak with them!

Thanks for the follow-up on Chipotle, Kathy! I recently realized they use too much soybean oil as well. I found on their website that the pork is not cooked in soybean oil, so I have been sticking with that for now. I hope Dr. Cate can talk to them about using good ol’fashioned lard instead!

Dr Cate,

What is your take on use of saturated fats for frying? I do like eating foods fried in coconut oil on occasion.r
 Reply Dr. Cate says: November 12, 2011 at 8:50 am 
Matheiu
Saturated fatty acids can handle heat. In chapter 8 of Deep Nutrition we explain all about good fats, bad fats, and why you should read every label and what to look for to avoid eating MegaTrans or‘secret’trans fats to prevent birth defects, cancer, blood clots, and more.

Dr. Cate,
I just finished reading your book Deep Nutrition, and I wanted to thank you for changing my life. I am banishing vegetable oils from my cooking. I wish I could cut them completely out of my life, but I have friends and family who cook with them, and I’m not ready to cut out friends and family.

I wanted to ask about how long it will take for my body to heal from all the oxidative stress it’s been under from a lifetime of eating vegetable oils? My mother cooked a lot of traditional foods while we were growing up (bone/meat broths at least 3 days a week, cultured vegetables, and meat on the bone), but she used vegetable oil for frying, making dressings, and marinating.

How long shall I wait before I plan to become pregnant?

Will you be writing a book specifically on pregnancy in the near future?

Thank you

Congratulations for planning ahead! I’d say after 6 months you should be good. Why six? I have heard over and over from people who change their diets that, in addition to weight loss, skin health changes, blood pressure improvements, they noticed amazing improvements in their overall well being and energy after about that amount of time. Presumably what this does is provide time for gene expression to be optimized and enzymes that have been down-regulated and dormant have been switched back on. This is not to say that all genetic damage will have been repaired! So it will continue to be very important for you to enable your children to follow a traditional-style diet for as long as you have control over what they eat.

I have always been a bit on the slim side and my kids seem to be slimmer than healthy. They are 6,5 and 4 (wish I had read your book earlier). We eat, and have always eaten, real butter, whole milk, homemade meals and occasional bone broths. Over the last two years I have incorporated soaked grains and more bone broths into our diet along with some fermented foods (mostly condiments). Do you have any suggestions for helping kids gain weight? Or a guide for a healthy weight to height ratio?

They’ve got lots of growing left in them and taking care as it sound like you are will optimize that growth even making up for earlier deficiencies.

To help gain weight, my best suggestion is working with their appetites to expand on what they already like, for example if they like chicken nuggets, then try oven roasted chicken thighs with some kind or crunch salty seasoning. The point being when offered healthy food that appeals, barring any digestive difficulties, they will eat and grow appropriately.

It can be hard to tell what normal is anymore, so here are charts for girls: http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/growthcharts2/l/blgirlstwo.htm and boys: http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/growthcharts2/l/blboystwo.htm 
with useful info on how to interpret them from these web sites.
