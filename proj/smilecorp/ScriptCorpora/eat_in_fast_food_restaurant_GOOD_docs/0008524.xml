 Tastee Freez is a fast food restaurant franchise that specializes in frozen soft serve deserts. These creamy, soft-serve novelties were born in 1950 . An inventor by the name of Leo Maranz created the “ Tastee Freez Industries, Inc. ” along with his partner, Harry Axene , who was an entrepreneur. Axene had started to market a new kind of soft serve freezer that was called the “ Freez King ”. This continuous mix freezer that was automatic had engineering that went way beyond any other equipment like it on the market. Additionally, it was much easier to maintain and was smaller than the other kinds of machines being used for this. Some of these soft serve machines are still in use today. http://www.chicagotasteefreez.com/about.html 

Tastee Freeze was purchased by a California based group named Galardi Group Franchise&amp;Leasing in May 2003 . They claim to be firmly dedicated to escalate the Tastee Freez brand and stand by its legacy for many years to come. Most of the current Tastee Freez restaurants are located in the mid-west and Virginia. http://www.tastee-freez.com/about.php
