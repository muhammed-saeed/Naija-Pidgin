Going to continue with the crime reports, as that is the best source of crime right now (DCSO has even started to list crimes).

 Take Our Poll I’m thinking about continuing the blog.  The majority of it will be things I’ve heard on the police scanner (though I might make it into an article rather than what I’ve been doing) and from crimereports.com and links to news articles.  I just don’t have time to do much else.  So, if you want the blog back, check yes or no on the poll.  And if you would like to volunteer (I can’t pay you, I can’t afford to) to write news stories for the blog, just let me know by posting a comment below.  I would love to eventually have someone covering local government, someone else covering business news, another covering BOE news, etc, someone who had time to go to the meetings.  I’ve deleted the email I had for this blog–but if I get enough of a response I’ll set another one up.

I don’t have time right now to update the blog.  Not sure when (or if) I will continue it.
