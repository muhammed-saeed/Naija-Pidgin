 Thanksgiving &gt; Cooking Tips November 17, 2005 
 
 
Preparing Dressing or Stuffin&apos;
 When preparing Dressing or Stuffin&apos;(depends on where you&apos;re from, what you call it), for Thanksgiving or any other meal. Always prepare this dish either in a glass or Pyrex brand, or a roaster pan. Not in an aluminum baking pan. If you use aluminum pan, be sure to take the dressing out of this pan when putting up the food after your meal.

My sister used an aluminum baking pan to bake her cornbread dressing in one year for Thanksgiving and didn&apos;t know to take it from the pan and all of her family got sick from the dressing afterwards. She really hated it, as she&apos;d make extras on the Dressing&apos;to put in the freezer for later meals. Instead, after getting back from the hospital, she had to toss it all in the trash.

Aluminum will not make you sick. Your sister used that as an excuse because she neglected to follow proper food safety and the dressing basically went bad. I can only imagine how long the dressing sat out on the counter before it was covered and put in the fridge. Probably hours. So, aluminum won&apos;t make you sick, a sister who doesn&apos;t know how to properly store her food will.

With all due respect........aluminum pans do not cause food poisoning. My mother and I have both used aluminum pans for the dressing. We always ran out of glass casserole dishes when we prepared for our large, loud, hungry clan. Never any food poisoning. I also worked in food service for our public school system....no problem there either. My son is a health inspector for the state and verifies my statements. Acidic foods stored in aluminum containers will pick up a nasty mettalic taste so that is not a good idea.

It is possible to lose track of time and leave food setting out at room temperature for too long. Only 2 hours is considered safe! Also , when putting leftovers in the refrigerator they need to be in a thin layer, not large thick clumps, so that they can cool to a safe temperature quickly. Food poisoning is not for whimps! I sympathize with your family. Three years ago I spent 4 days in intensive care and 3 more in concentrated care thanks to a food born illness, compliments of a local fast food restaurant! A bacteria&quot;not e-coli, but very similar in its attack&quot;tried to kill me. Take my word for it ...you do not want to go through it. If there&apos;s any doubt in your mind about the safety of the food......don&apos;t eat it! Keep everyone safe this Thanksgiving. HOT foods HOT and COLD foods COLD. Room temperature is a BAD idea!

okay, I&apos;ll ask....what&apos;s wrong with using the aluminum pan. I didn&apos;t know they would make you sick.

Stuffing and dressing are the same thing...it&apos;s called dressing if done outside the bird and stuffing if it is inside the bird. I don&apos;t like to use aluminum pans.
