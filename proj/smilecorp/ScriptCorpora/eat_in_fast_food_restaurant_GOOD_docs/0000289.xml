ONE of Irelands largest department stores Heatons have announced that it will be opening its latest store in the M1 Drogheda Retail Park this coming June.
And joint letting agents for the scheme OBrien Collins Real Estate Alliance and Hamilton Osborne King have also completed a number of other recent deals in the park.
Locally-based soft furnishings retailer Tullys is due to open an outlet in June and Subway, the American sandwich chain has also been confirmed for the park.
Heatons will join Woodies DIY as a second anchor tenant for the scheme, with a unit of over 2,550sqm.
Heatons, who have become increasingly aggressive within the market, now has a total of 49 stores throughout Ireland north and south.
The ground floor area which extends to approximately 1,600sqm will largely stock mens and ladies fashion along with homeware products.
The first floor will be dedicated to Sportsworld, which carrys top brands such as Nike, Adidas and Reebok in both clothing and footwear.
Sportsworld is Europes fastest growing sports retailer with over 170 stores throughout the UK, Ireland and Belgium.
Heatons is seen by many other retailers as a major draw in generating constant footfall to retail schemes and it is anticipated that a number of other top retailers will follow Heatons into this development,said Gabriel OBrien.
Tullys, a well-known local soft furnishings retailer have recently taken a 715 sqm unit which is also due to open in June.
James Tully originally established Tully and Co Drapers in 1924 on West Street, in the heart of Drogheda Town and the business was subsequently taken over by his son Hubert Tully in the late 1950s.
It is now successfully trading out of two large retail premises on West Street.
A decision was taken by the Tully family to expand their existing soft furnishing business and move to new larger premises at the M1 Drogheda Retail Park where they will trade as Home Living / Soft Furnishings by Hubert Tully.
Subway has also recently secured a unit of approximately 100 sqm within the park.
Subway, the American sandwich chain was founded in 1965 and is the worlds second largest fast-food franchise in the world with more than 25,727 restaurants in 84 countries.
This latest unit which is due to open in the coming weeks will bring the total number of Subway stores now open in Ireland north and south to over 80.
First Stop, which is backed and promoted by Bridgestone is due to open in the coming weeks.
It will operate a tyre and ancillary car service business. Western Motors from Galway City have taken all three motor-mall sites for a state-of-the-art motor showroom development, soon to be under construction.
Future phases for this scheme include a state-of-the-art leisure centre extending to approx 8,851sqm, which will be a landmark building comprising a four-storey glazed façade overlooking the Boyne Valley and the new Boyne bridge, a petrol-filling station, drive-thru fast-food restaurant, a discount supermarket and business park.
The operator for the leisure centre is one of Irelands largest leisure operators and will be announced shortly.
There are two remaining units within the retail park suitable for a wide variety of uses including kitchens, bathrooms, carpet and furniture.
At 715 sqm and 1,080 sqm, they are the ideal size for bulky goods retailers. The joint agents are currently in negotiations with a number of retailers in respect of the remaining space.

For further information please contact Ronan Rooney, Hamilton Osborne King (01) 6181300 or Gabriel OBrien, OBrien Collins Real Estate Alliance (041) 9875444.
