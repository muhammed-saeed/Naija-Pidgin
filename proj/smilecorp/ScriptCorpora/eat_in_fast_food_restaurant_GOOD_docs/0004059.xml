Review
 Reviewer: BookReview.com (Madison, WI United States) &quot;Let&apos;s Eat Out!&quot; will make you hungry and give you the power to protect yourself from food allergies at the same time. This series is an amazingly comprehensive guide that is sure to help thousands of people to feel more in control of their lives. Addressing ten food allergens in seven international cuisines was a project that took years of research. The result is an allergy free passport, 496 page, full color book that includes 175+ menu items with descriptions, and preparation questions for you to ask to restaurant staff, and so much more that will give you the inspiration to once again go out to eat. There are snack ideas, beverage categories, quick reference guides and extensive detailed menus to learn about. Knowledge is power and so is asking the right questions. The authors give you the knowledge as well as the right questions to ask in order to protect yourself and/or your loved ones who have food allergies. The book even includes information on 50+ global airlines that offer special meals. The main book is so easy to use with color coded tabs on the chapter pages, making it simple to open up to Indian Cuisine or American Steak and Seafood, among others. Each chapter offers an interesting overview of that culture&apos;s cooking habits, which I promise you will make your mouth water. The introduction and first couple of chapters are a step by step guide that will help those who are new to dealing with allergies as well as those who have lived with them for years. Written in layman&apos;s terms, you will not need your doctor sitting beside you in the restaurant in order to order! In addition to the main book there are small passports available that are meant to be carried along in the pocket as you explore the world of dining out. Whether you are a world traveler or simply heading into town to sample some various cuisines, these smaller guides are for quick reference. Three of them focus on certain cuisines, while a fourth offers a multi-lingual phrase guide that is dedicated to communicating special dietary needs. This passport provides translations from English to French, German, Italian and Spanish. The series is the first of its kind and promises to enrich the lives of many people. A well-written, professionally researched, gorgeous and sturdy book that is likely to become a common sight in many a restaurant and home. Review by Heather Froeschl.

In &quot;Let&apos;s Eat Out!&quot; Koeller and La France have put together an impressive amount of information to make life easier for travelers and people who just want to eat out with family and friends.

I found the book a bit difficult at first because there is just so much content to sort out. It&apos;s definitely not a book to digest in one sitting!

I soon realized it really is a combination of broad reference guide and quick reference &quot;cheat sheets.&quot; Once that became clear, it was much easier to scan and use the table of contents and index to find specific information. You can choose to just use the quick guides or go to the more detailed explanations.

All in all, the authors cover a very broad topic in an orderly fashion that makes it easy to locate information for a variety of situations. They use 7 common cuisine types, from American Steak and Seafood to Thai, to analyze the issues a diner can expect to face. They offer comments on the ingredients, the way food is prepared and on likely sources of hidden cross contamination.

After you read a couple of these, you begin to see the patterns and it would not be so difficult to apply the same process to another type of food. As they point out, it&apos;s all about educating yourself and learning what questions to ask.

Poring through their food/menu analysis, I discovered to my dismay that the item I had been selecting from a fast food restaurant most likely contains hidden gluten that I would not have thought to question. I did wonder why I didn&apos;t feel good every time I ate there!

Not only does the book cover information about individual foods, styles of cuisine, and 10 common food allergens, it also provides specific information about travel including contact information for individual airlines and the special diets they provide, contact information for associations and organizations in many parts of the world and even some translation phrases.

I&apos;d recommend &quot;Let&apos;s Eat Out!&quot; as a valuable reference book. It&apos;s especially useful for those who frequently eat out or travel and even better, those who&apos;d like to eat out more but have hesitated to take the risk. It could open up a whole new world.

The authors deserve the recognition that their book received as a Benjamin Franklin award finalist for 2006 in the Health (Wellness/Nutrition) category. 14 of 15 people found the following review helpful For gluten intolerance and food sensitivities 20 Jan 2007 By Alisa Marie Fleming - Published on Amazon.com Format: Paperback &quot;Let&apos;s Eat Out!&quot; covers a very difficult topic, restaurant dining for people with food allergies and intolerances. For adults who should avoid top allergens due to mild to moderate food allergies and intolerances, this can be a very useful book. I have already referenced it a few times for some restaurant inspiration, outside of my usual Asian selections.

The book itself is stylishly laid out with color-coded chapters, strategically placed photographs, useful charts, and sample menus. It addresses ten of the most common food allergens: dairy, eggs, wheat, gluten (an intolerance), soy, peanuts, tree nuts, corn, fish, and shellfish.

It should be noted, that this book was written with celiac disease, multiple food &quot;sensitivities&quot;, and gluten intolerance in mind. It may not be very appropriate for those who have life-threatening food allergies or severe intolerances. This is not to blame the authors. The various styles of food preparation combined with a high risk of cross-contamination in food service kitchens, make this a complicated area to address. Though, as one food allergy mom pointed out to me, the &quot;Allergy-Free&quot; title is a bit deceiving in this respect.

Also, for those who do have true food allergies, this book should not be used as a dining bible, but more as a suggestion based resource for further research and diligence. As someone who lives with a milk protein allergy, I unfortunately noted many errors with respect to the foods listed as &quot;not containing the allergen.&quot; Guacamole (often made with sour cream), margarine (frequently contains lactose and/or milk protein), and sausages (many brands contain cheese) were just a few that caused me to raise the red flag. Your own questions and food label reading would still be required when utilizing this book.

Luckily, the authors do relay what questions to ask, and in many different languages. Kim Koeller has traveled extensively while living with multiple food allergies. This is well evidenced by the resources provided, including a multi-lingual phrase section and what seems to be a very useful airline guide. For those most interested in travel, the authors of &quot;Let&apos;s Eat Out!&quot; have also produced a &quot;Multi-Lingual Phrase Passport&quot; for food allergies that is pocket-sized. I thought this was a very handy little guide! 12 of 13 people found the following review helpful Great gift! 26 Oct 2005 By Marcus &quot;D&quot; - Published on Amazon.com Format: Paperback My Aunt bought me this book at an allergy convetion. I&apos;ve only had it for a week, but as someone who has recently been diagnosed with Celiac disease, I was happy to find it easy to understand and can imagine it&apos;ll be very useful. Thank you for writing a book that someone who is not a doctor can understand. › Go to Amazon.com to see all 15 reviews Were these reviews helpful?  Let us know
