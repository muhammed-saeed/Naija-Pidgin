 Average User Rating Beer Quality Beer Selection Food Service Overall Awesome! Awesome! Good Good Great 
 Individual User Reviews 
 Beer Quality Beer Selection Food Service Overall Awesome! Great So So Good Good I live in the area and I visit this place frequently since the beer selection changes every few weeks or so. The food is nothing special, I had it once and I was not impressed, and never ordered food again. Beer selection is very good, and that&apos;s the only reason that keeps me coming back to Palmer&apos;s. I ordered a Dirty Martini there once and it was awful, the proportions were completely off, I returned it and asked for a beer instead. I&apos;m not here leaving a negative feedback, I&apos;d just like to give you the consumer&apos;s perspective. Suggestion for Palmer&apos;s managers: research into more Rogue beer, as well as more desirable and unique choices on your menu.
