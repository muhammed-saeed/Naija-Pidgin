 Mark M. said: &quot;I don&apos;t know what Allen C. is talking about. This place is great! Maybe he thinks Cambodian and Thai food are the same. THEY&apos;RE NOT. Cambodian flavor is more subtle, yet they will make it hotter if you ask.   As for flavor, try the…&quot;   read more»

I decided to stop by cause it&apos;s all about the spicy chicken!!! They have pretty nice size chicken tenders. For fast food the food was cooked great. The woman behind the counter had to deal with a very rude man from Exterior Solutions Inc in Carson. They all had the shirts on so I looked them up. No surprise they had bad reviews. She  dealt with him very well. If you have company shirts on you should realize you are representing the company.
Popeye&apos;s was very clean and workers are very nice!!! Great job.

It&apos;s Popeye&apos;s..we ordered some chicken to go to bring back to our hotel. We read the reviews, and people would complain about the staff, the rudeness, the texting while working....

the chicken is still good, and if the workers want to text while working...fine because apparently while they were texting during our order, they can&apos;t count and gave us 3 extra pieces of chicken in our order for free.

So, if you want more chicken due to the workers not knowing how to count, come here!

Chicken is comparable to other Popeye&apos;s.  They cook it to a nice consistency.  The establishment is very stingy though.  How are you going to give a customer, who ordered 6-10 pieces, one packet of hot sauce?  Many times, they don&apos;t have the hot sauce either.  Like I said, the chicken is comparable to other Popeye&apos;s, so nothing more and nothing less.  There&apos;s a parking lot in this plaza.  The wait time varies.  Sometimes, I&apos;ve been there and it takes 20 minutes and sometimes I&apos;m out in 5 minutes or less.
There is now a $5 minimum to use the credit/debit card machine.

People complains about service, but seriously this is a fast food restaurant, you just buy your food and leave.

I always come on Tuesday nights since they have the special (99 cents for a leg&amp;thigh, can&apos;t be that).  Sometimes I have to wait since they have to fried chicken FRESH but hey, I have never waited longer than 6 mins for my order no matter how long the line it was (there were 13 people ahead of me).

The chicken is really good, I like their mild chicken more than their spicy, since they marinated their chicken prior to frying, it has more flavor sunk into the chicken then church&apos;s.  Flaky , crispy , juicy chicken is what keeps me coming back and I never eat in store, why bother?

I like fried chicken but do not love it. BUUUUUTTTTTTTT the spicy chicken here is the best. Especially with the cajun rice and fries. The workers here are always friendly and service is very quick.
The sweet tea is good. Although I have had better.
I have never tried the samwiches kinda partial to KFC for those but I should try just to compare.
The chicken here is never dried out it has always been cooked to perfection.

Sorry to be the one to break it to you Whodini, but apparently &quot;at night&quot; isn&apos;t the only time the freaks come out.  In Hawaiian Gardens, they come out on an otherwise innocent Thursday afternoon as well.

A rare half day at work sent me meandering along the streets of this God forsaken &quot;community&quot; the other day.  After perusing the wares at Gumm&apos;s Antique Mall I decided to treat myself to some Popeye&apos;s.  It&apos;s been at least five years and I couldn&apos;t wait to get some of that golden crackly goodness in my mouf.

In the words of Vivian from Pretty Woman, &quot;Big mistake.  Huge.&quot;

Let&apos;s get the vittles out of the way.  I ordered a two piece breast/thigh with mashers and cajun rice, plus a biscuit.  I received a breast and leg.  Sigh.  The mashers were spicy like I remembered but the rice was a complete disaster.  Mushy mystery meat truly made this &quot;dirty rice&quot; and not in the good way.  Blech.  The chicken tasted heat lamped (that didn&apos;t stop me from devouring that skin though) and the mild variety didn&apos;t have that &quot;just enough&quot; spice like I remember.

And the biscuit.  Oh, the biscuit.  A hard crumbly little hockey puck of a thing, sorry Popeye&apos;s but as far as fast food bikkies go Church&apos;s has got ya beat with their deep fried honey butter atrocity and even the Colonel&apos;s better than this.  A packet of strawberry jam (a nice touch, I&apos;ll admit) didn&apos;t help.  The highlight of my meal was the Mirinda strawberry soda, very refreshing.

Let&apos;s move on to the patrons.  Ratty pajama pants/Sean John jacket clad baby mama with drippy popsicle eating toddler were the least of my worries.  Shady sketchy sunglasses guy casing the joint just outside the door didn&apos;t help matters much either.  We can&apos;t leave out the two ciggie smoking tweaker-esque &quot;Lady Liberty Tax Services&quot; promoting fresh from county gals who lingered in the parking lot.  My favorite was Mr. Octogenarian perv who unzips his bomber jacket to reveal a t-shirt that says &quot;Will do... (various bullshit) FOR SEX.&quot;  Then he says &quot;do you like my shirt?  I&apos;m gonna wear it to church on Sunday.&quot;

Hey Robin, the next time your gut instinct tells you &quot;just go home and make a sandwich&quot; you should listen dingbat.

Yes, YES GOD YES!!! Oh Popeye!!!!

Fried Chicken and Personal Trainers don&apos;t typically go together, BUT you can call me hypocrite and ghetto for loving the Popeye&apos;s.

Granted that I&apos;ve only eaten Popeye&apos;s chicken 3 times in my entire life, but every time I think of fried chicken, it&apos;s Popeye&apos;s at the tip of my brain. It&apos;s a great temptation to resist.

Moist chicken and flavourful batter with an amazing crispness that is both flaky and dense. Great spicy chicken and the biscuits aren&apos;t too shabby either.

Sure, Knott&apos;s and Love Letter are also pretty stellar choices for fried poultry, and let&apos;s not forget Church&apos;s and Roscoe&apos;s, but Popeye&apos;s is my personal number one pick for instant guilt and concurrent pleasure.

You haven&apos;t tried Popeyes??  WTH??  Mild is my fav... along with the mash potatoes and gravy!  They usually have good deals too like recently they had 7 pieces of legs/thighs for $7.
Skin the next day isn&apos;t as crisp so make sure you finish it ALL the night you buy it...LMAO... at least that is my excuse.  hahahahahaha
