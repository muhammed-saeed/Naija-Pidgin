Question:

One of our utility&apos;s customersan Arby&apos;s fast-food restaurantwants to reduce its electrical energy bill. The owner has Arby&apos;s restaurants in other towns,
and has noticed that the electrical consumption in our area is about double that of his other restaurants. Can you suggest some low cost/no cost options and possibly audit procedures to assist them?

Answer:

From the monthly electric billing history you provided, I plugged the usage numbers into a spreadsheet to look at the usage profile. Except for a high-use billing in February, the rest of the profile looks consistent, with demand and use increases to account for expected air conditioning loads. Since you don&apos;t have information about their gas usage (used for heating), I don&apos;t know how the building reacts to colder outside temperatures. Also without the building square footage, I can&apos;t comment on whether or not the usage is higher than other fast food restaurants.

The relatively consistent energy use leads me to suspect the difference in consumption
is due to equipment operation. Either this facility has more electrically operated
equipment, or some of the equipment at this facility is operated more continuously
than the equipment at other facilities. The differences could be found by an auditpossibly a simple walk-through by the owner, or a more detailed audit might be needed. Some initial things to consider are:

 First I would itemize all of the electrically operated equipment at this facility and
 compare the hours of equipment operation with that of other facilities. The equipment may be larger at this facility and draw more energy. Or the operators may turn
 equipment on earlier and let more equipment run continuously. Food preparation
 consumes over a fourth of the electrical use in fast-food restaurants. 

 Lighting can vary from facility to facility. Incandescent lighting uses a lot more
 energy than fluorescent lighting, and lighting comprises about a fourth the electrical use
 in fast-food restaurants.

 Exhaust fans can be a large cause of energy use. Depending on layout of hoods and
 equipment operation, use exhaust fans only when necessary.

 Operation of the HVAC equipment when the building is unoccupied (night time) can use
 a lot of energy. Equipment may not have automatic set-back, or operators may not be
 setting temperatures back to reduce energy consumption.

 Another electrical energy user is refrigeration. One facility may leave doors
 open for walk in coolers (where another facility might keep them closed), or door gaskets
 might be in poor condition, or defrost controls might be malfunctioning.

 

Here are energy assessment resources that the owner can use for a self-guided audit. Or the owner could hire a firm to perform an audit. I suspect that, without too much difficulty, the owner can find out why this facility is using more electrical energy than his other facilities.

The owner may be interested in the National Restaurant Association&apos;s MAECO Study Group , which meets twice a year and includes energy efficiency and energy use as one of its areas of focus.
