Alex Hope, British Trader, Reportedly Spends $320,381 At Nightclub [PHOTOS]

Ever partied for $100,000 per hour? One British finance wonder kid seems to have.

Alex Hope, a 23-year-old UK foreign exchange trader, reportedly racked up what, if true, could be one of the most expensive nightclub bills of all time , a whopping $320,381.65 in just three hours of partying, the Mirror reports . That would be even more than NBA phenom Lebron James spent at a Las Vegas nightclub , when he was once billed over $171,000.

At the Playground Club in Liverpool, Hope, who describes himself as a &quot;self-taught trader,&quot; reportedly lavished fellow partiers with a specially ordered 30-liter bottle of champagne by luxury brand Ace of Spades worth nearly $200,000, as well as close to 50 other, smaller bottles ranging in price from $780 to nearly $40,000.

After a recent story about a banker&apos;s one percent lunch tip didn&apos;t hold up, it&apos;s advised not to take the claims all too seriously. Still, a representative from Hope&apos;s PR agency confirmed to The Huffington Post that, at the very least, Hope was among a group of those responsible for the effervescent extravagance. The manager of the Playground said he did in fact call the club in advance to specially pre-order the giant bottle.

 See the entire receipt below: 
 
Hope, who is employed by Zone Invest Group , discovered he had a knack for foreign exchange trading while working at a fast food restaurant and aspiring to become a soccer player, and he soon became one of the industry&apos;s rising stars, according to the Mirror . &quot;Currency is my passion,&quot; Hope boldly declares on his personal site.

Hope&apos;s lavish celebration is one in a long line of decadent Wall Street-like parties, but his version may be unlike some celebrations of recent months. Many big banks moved their typically extravagant holiday parties in-house or cancelled them all together last year, according to The New York Times .
 
But extravagant balls may be back on the rise, if they ever really left . In January, Wall Street fraternity Kappa Beta Phi hosted an opulent event at the St. Regis Hotel in New York, one of many luxury hotels that the industry continues to patronize , according to USA Today . Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley upgraded their cocktail parties to snazzier locations this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bloomberg reports.

And even day-to-day, finance types like Hope are pushing the limits of luxury. &quot;Rampant&quot; abuse of employee meal stipends has allowed many traders to frequently charge lobster and dinners worth up to $90 to their firms, Fast Company reports .

 littlestar 139 Fans 04:22 PM on 03/07/2012 Personally, I find that expensive champagnes taste like cat food (don&apos;t ask me how I know what cat food tastes like). I prefer the gool ol&apos; cheap stuff, like Martini Asti. Tasty and affordable. And I have never drank champagne that was more than $300 a bottle, so maybe a $4500 bottle does taste good? littlestar: Personally, I find that expensive champagnes taste like cat food http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/littlestar/alex-hope-nightclub-uk-forex-trader-racks-up-most-expensive-bill_n_1324330_139723991.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

He could have had those same folks/friends over to his house or perhaps a rented event room for a ton less money and had a great time. He doesn&apos;t spend money wisely so I would not use his financial services. I am all for extravagance, love to spend, but not just to show off in front of others which is what this seems to be. I would never pay those inflated prices for a night out. Its dumb. opinionlady1: Well here is the thing.

 ray77 105 Fans 02:09 PM on 03/07/2012 yeah, you will read about him in a few months, accused of robbing someones investments, but not to worry, he will do no time or very little.
It&apos;s kind like the Hedge fund trader in NYC that let his secretary take him for nearly 1mil using his Amex card.
If I had investments with him, I&apos;d be worried, anyone that careless with 1million dollars, imagine him with 100 million. There&apos;s an old saying, take care of the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.
