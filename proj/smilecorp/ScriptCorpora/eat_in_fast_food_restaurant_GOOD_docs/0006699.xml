 Dining for Fast Food 

 Digital Dining combines the fast
 food features you need with the flexibility and power of a full featured
 table service solution. That&apos;s because Digital Dining offers a
 broad, fully integrated solution rather than a narrow specialized
 product. This is especially important if your operation goes
 beyond the boundaries of traditional fast food restaurant.
