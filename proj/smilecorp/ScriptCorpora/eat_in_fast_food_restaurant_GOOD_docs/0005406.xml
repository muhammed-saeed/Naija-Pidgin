 Sing to Answer Who, What, Where and other Common Questions 
 Picture Book with CD 
 (release date: October 15th, 2005)
 This project musically illustrates the often difficult difference between where, what, who, why, when, and how. After learning question words individually, children are then challenged to distinguish between the question words as they are combined together in songs. A scored flap is included to cover and uncover the answers as you go. Sign language line art is incorporated to help children grasp the abstract nature of questioning by encouraging the use of signing along with the music. 

 Tracks: Who, What, Where, Where What Who, When, Why, What Why When Where, How Many, How
