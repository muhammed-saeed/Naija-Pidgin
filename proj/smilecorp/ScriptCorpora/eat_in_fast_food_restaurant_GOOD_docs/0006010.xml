 &quot;We were really excited to find your company for large flat screen monitor enclosures. We were looking for something that didn&apos;t look overwhelmingly industrial and found it with your product. We have gotten nothing but praise from visitors to our facility. It was very easy to install our monitors. You and your team have been extremely helpful and professional. Thank you, we look forward to continuing our business relationship.&quot;    --Bosch, LLC

 Outdoor Digital Menu Board Enclosures 
 
LCD TV Enclosures are an effective way to implement digital signage in outdoor or harsh locations. LCD enclosures are essential for protecting against water, dust, tampering, theft, and harsh temperatures. Digital signage is a cutting edge, eye-catching, and efficient advertising method that can be customized and updated much more easily when compared with old static signs. One niche that is on the rise is digital menu boards for quick serve restaurant (fast food restaurant) drive up windows.

 Custom&amp;Stainless Steel LCD Enclosures 
 
We can design and manufacture any custom enclosure. A stainless steel LCD enclosure can be installed in locations where it would not be possible otherwise such as a beach front restaurant patio. Stainless steel LCD enclosures must be water and dust tight to stop particle build up and water leakage that can lead to failure of the internal LCD or PC. The finish of the stainless steel that it preferred and provides a nice retail or high end look is a brushed finish.

 Sloped Top LCD TV Enclosures 
 
Tilted, slanted, or sloped top LCD TV enclosures prevent tampering, theft, or damage to LCD TV and computer equipment in hospitals and medical centers. The sloped top is a preferred design of hospitals looking for an anti-ligature or non loop solution for mental health wards. An LCD or plasma television cannot be openly mounted in a psychiatric and mental health unit, since the patient needs to be protected from self harm and an openly mounted TV could facilitate self harm. The sloped top enclosure is mounted flush against a wall.
