Why Do People Eat Fast Food?
 
 Tweet Bookmark 
 

 gabriel amadeus Food that is supplied quickly after placing an order with minimal service is often referred to as fast-food. Although fast food is widely criticized for it&apos;s high calorie content and perceived poor quality, fast food is eaten by millions of people every year. The reasons behind the popularity of fast food range from convenience through to brand familiarity.

Whilst there are certainly negative consequences of eating certain types of fast food, there is nothing to say that the concept of fast food in itself is necessarily bad.

 The reasons people eat fast food 
Love it or loathe it, fast food is certainly very popular. The fast food industry is thought to be worth a staggering $1.5 billion in the US alone.
Based on this, there must be something fundamentally appealing about fast food that makes it so popular. In my opinion, the main reasons people eat fast food are:

 Economically priced food Speed and efficiency of service Brand familiarity Representative of popular cuisine 


 The fast food economy 
One of the main reasons people flock to fast food restaurants is because they are often seen as an economic and hassle free way to enjoy a meal. The way fast food chains keep their prices relatively low is by producing their food on a large scale. This reduces the cost of purchasing and preparing the food, and means that they can afford to charge relatively low prices whilst still maintaining a significant profit margin.
There is a lot of criticism out there aimed at the way the fast food industry is run.
One particular target of contempt is the wage structure of many fast food companies- where executives and owners of companies earn huge sums, whilst many of their employees work for a minimum hourly rate.

 Speed of fast food 
By mass producing a relatively small menu, fast food restaurants are able to provide warm meals very quickly without encountering a significant loss through wastage. The idea of being able to order at a counter, receive your meal within seconds, and not have to worry about waiting to be seated, served or asking for a cheque means that fast food restaurants are often the first choice for many diners that are in a rush.

 Fast food brands 
The branding of fast food chains is a major factor in their success. Imagine being out on the road, or wondering about an unfamiliar town or country. If you&apos;re looking for somewhere to eat, you may want to play it safe and stick to what you know. Fast food companies have built an industry of making sure they are &apos;what we know&apos; through aggressive advertising and marketing strategies. Essentially, knowing what you&apos;re going to get from a fast food brand means you are more likely to pick them over a competitor you don&apos;t know anything about.
From a customers point of view, it is useful to know that you can count on a fast food restaurant to provide certain things. Advantages that familiarity of a fast food restaurant includes:

 Familiarity with the menu Child-friendly environment Ability to easily estimate the cost of a meal through knowledge of their pricing

 Why Do People Eat Fast Food? People eat poorly for a number of reasons, but there are two main reasons why I believe that... Why Do People Eat Unhealthy Foods When They Know Is Not Good For Them?

 People eat poorly for a number of reasons, but there are two main reasons why I believe that they tend to eat junk food, even though they know that it is not good for them and also potentially doing them harm.

The first is that junk food is available, it&apos;s present, it&apos;s around, it&apos;s easy to pick up, I could get a sugary soda drink and a chocolate bar without treading a hundred footsteps from my front door. If you look at any shop, the junk food is on display, because it&apos;s no good for us and the sugar industries really need us to keep eating that sweet gunk.

Sugar is addictive, try coming off a chocolate habit, you&apos;ll get cranky, have headaches, mood swings, cravings, as if you had a minor addiction. The sweet industry survives on that addiction.
And then we give those things to our kids and happily get them addicted too, doesn&apos;t seem right.

 People eat fast food because it is quick and much easier than cooking. It is also really cheap and most people are too busy to run to the grocery stort and buy food , and then come home and unpack the groceries, and THEN cook the food. People don;t have that kind of time...so they turn to McDonald&apos;s and KFC. This is why over 30% of America is obese.

 It&apos;s horrible, actually.
People are addicted to the sugary, unhealthy food which is the cause of all of our health problems. Then, once people are addicted, it&apos;s harder to give up.
We then come up with band-aid solutions to cover up the symptoms from our own unhealthy choices of food which are full of sugar, fat, chemicals, and pesticides.

We are killing ourselves, and we don&apos;t need it even as a treat. If you can get past the two-week mark, then you will no longer want this junk food.

Sustain yourself with God&apos;s given vegetation (fruits, vegetables, all natural and organic whole grains) and live healthily. You&apos;ll feel better and stronger.

:) Good luck.

 I think nowadays people prefer to eat fast food to save their time. For instance, many workers around the world just have half an hour rest. It is easy to go to fast food restaurant and eat or take food with them to their office. Because there are no time to go home and having traditional launch with the family. Furthermore may be the wife is in her work.
There are other point, most of adults  cant cook, for that they just go to eat in fast food

 While fast food is intended for people who are busy, most of the people that eat at such establishments annually are not busy whatsoever, usually teenagers or young adults who are too lazy/unwilling to learn how to cook. It&apos;s mind-boggling that people believe that the majority eat it because they are &quot;busy&quot;. No, they&apos;re not busy, they&apos;re lazy and dumb. Fast food being portrayed as something &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;edgy&quot; in the media with people like celebrities and athletes being featured in commercials have only intensified such a thought. It tastes like trash, and to the person who said 1-2 meals a week is alright, don&apos;t talk when you have no idea what you&apos;re talking about.

In short: It&apos;s the cheap, easy, lazy, cool thing to do, and your average person&apos;s taste buds wouldn&apos;t know the difference between a prime rib and a steak-um. Which is why you&apos;ll likely spot obese people or social urchins filling up their sitting areas.

 While that is true, we can break the chain. Let&apos;s not buy it. Let&apos;s just use it as a reward. Adults should reward themselves too. But not all good things done should be rewarded; only those rare ones like helping a stranger in an awkward situation or keep candy for other people that might need it in case of hypoglycaemia.

I always have candy in my pocket so that I could easily hand it over to someone I meet in public that&apos;s having a hypoglycaemia attack. (Hypoglycaemia is when a diabetic person has an extremely low sugar in their system due to too much insulin injected into them.)

 There has been extensive reporting of the effects that the fast-food culture is having on modern society. It is apparent that the current obesity epidemic, which is increasing in both the UK and US, has been fuelled by the convenience of food from outlets such as McDonalds. It is becoming less popular amongst more healthy persons to want to enjoy fast food with the controversial press and media focus on the side effects of the food this industry supply.
