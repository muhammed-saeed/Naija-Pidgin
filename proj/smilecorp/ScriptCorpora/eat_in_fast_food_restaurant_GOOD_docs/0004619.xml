 Notes from the Richard Amero Collection 

 Balboa Park notes ~ Samuel Parsons ~ Kate Sessions 

 1980 | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 | 1990 

 

 

January ?, 1987, Los Angeles Times, II, 2:1. EDITORIAL: A Return to Park Land.

This probably will be the year the San Diego City Council determines what Balboa Park’s future will be.

In what is certain to be an emotional and broadly contested debate, the council must first decide what to do with the 34 acres and 42 buildings the Navy will be turning over to the city next year as compensation for the Florida Canyon site the federal government seized for the new $293-million Navy Hospital. And by year’s end, the council should receive recommendations of the various committees and boards that will scrutinize a controversial consultant’s report --- known as the Pekarek Plan --- on the overall development, maintenance and financing of the park.

January 11, 1987, San Diego Union, C-2. OPINION: A plan for the park . . . disposition of 42 old hospital buildings.

These old buildings are no bargain. The waste would be in keeping them going, not in tearing them down. But all of that aside, the determining factor is that the city does not have the multi-millions required to rehabilitate and to operate these structures.

January 18, 1987, San Diego Union , F-33. Dale Ward: Park’s herbarium is impressive.

Hidden away on the top floor of the Natural History Museum is an obscure &quot;garden&quot; where you can find a plant collection boasting more than 120,000 specimens. The plants here are not ordinary garden varieties. These plants have been painstakingly pressed flat, dried and mounted on acid-free paper. Only then are they meticulously filed into their storage cabinets in a systematic and logical manner --- especially to a botanist.

January 30, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-10. OPINION: Park land, not ugly park offices

Unfortunately, the City Council’s Public Facilities and Recreation Committee would mar the natural beauty of Inspiration Point by preserving a big, ugly hospital building. The Committee voted 5-0 to preserve four of the old hospital’s 42 buildings.

February, 1987. San Diego Magazine, 104+. The Tunnel and the Lake . . . Thinking the unthinkable about Balboa Park, by Robert Hostick.

In this article, Hostick tackles a very controversial proposal, first because it calls for a lake, tunnel, and underground garages to replace the city’s beloved Cabrillo Freeway, Route 163, under the graceful arches of the Cabrillo Bridge; and secondly because the project is really big, on the scale of something New York Chicago or Los Angeles would undertake. Down the road --- ten years from now --- San Diego may be secure enough to afford to save it’s great park, one of the most beautiful in the world. --- ED.

February 3, 1987, San Diego Union, B-6. OPINION: Remove the eyesore . . . get rid of clinic building.

The idea of using the clinic building for office workers is incompatible with the usage of Balboa Park as set forth in the City Charter and, therefore, such a concept probably lacks legality.

March 2, 1987 , San Diego Union, B-1. Michael Abrams: Council decided last week to tear town 39 of the buildings in the old Naval Hospital complex in Balboa Park

The council must still decide what to do with two of the three buildings it will leave standing, because the council only designated a use for the 43-year old chapel, which will be made available to veterans and veterans’ groups.

March 2, 1987, San Diego Union, B-1. Steve La Rue: Killer mushrooms sprout in Balboa Park.

The same species of deadly mushrooms that killed four people two years ago in Escondido have reappeared in San Diego County, this time sprouting in Balboa Park, just east of the intersection of Pershing Drive and 26 th Street, near Florida Canyon.

March 6, 1987, San Diego Tribune, A-1. Rita Calvano: Balboa Park looks to future.

Some of (the) proposals: banning cars from the park’s interior; pay parking garages on the park’s borders; more picnic grounds; more gardens; more restaurants; more museums; shops.

The foundation for any discussion of changing the 119-year old park will be the Pekarek Plan, a 4-year-old master plan for park development.

&quot;The point isn’t whether or not it’s a Gill building,&quot; says architect Richard Yen, hired to do drawings for the renovation. &quot;The point is it’s a melange of Gill, Goodhue and Winslow. That only increases its historical significance.&quot;

The Girl Scouts have occupied space in Balboa Park since 1922, when they camped out in the Pepper Grove, south of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater. They moved to the north side of the park east of Roosevelt Junior High School at Richmond and Upas streets in April 1956.

Because the Girl Scout’s lease does not expire until 2005, Robert Bourquin, aid the renovation cost could be amortized and a new fund developed to rebuild in another location if necessary.

April 14, 1987. San Diego Tribune. A-1. Sharon Spivak: To whom go spoils of room tax?

To those with colorful visions they can’t finance, San Diego’s hotel-room tax proceeds shimmer like the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

The division of the spoils --- $20 million this year and projected to increase substantially when the San Diego Convention Center opens in 1989 --- brings out in droves those backing any activity that can be tied to promotion of the city and tourism.

Through rounds of city council committee hearings that have been derisively dubbed by one disgusted participant as &quot;beg-a-thons,&quot; organizations annually compete for a share of the loot. They represent causes as diverse as the &quot;war against litter: and Latin fiestas to beach safety and art museums.

Yet as large as the pot is --- accumulated from 7 percent tax on room rates in 800 establishments containing more than 26,000 rooms --- there’s nowhere near enough money to go around.

Questions have been raised about the use of the hotel tax since it was approved by the city council at 4 percent in June 1964. A referendum to repeal the tax was defeated by the voters the following year.

April 17, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-3. Rita Calvano: Park and Recreation Board yesterday urged major deletions for Balboa Park master plan

The amphitheater and major restaurants in a proposed master plan for Balboa Park have been nixed by the Park and Recreation Board.

April 18, 1987, San Diego Tribune, C-4. Michael Richmond: Task force seeks 3 bond issues for upgrade of parks

The amphitheater and major restaurants recommended in a proposed master plan for Balboa Park have been nixed by the Park and Recreation Board.

With little discussion, the board voted to recommend that the city council eliminate these structures from the Pekarek Plan, which proposes them as major new sources of revenue for the park.

The board agrees such sources are needed but says the structures are inappropriate uses for the park. In the same vein, relocation of either of the park’s golf courses was also rejected. Landscape architect Ron Pekarek, hired by the city to develop a long-range plan, said these changes would provide another moneymaking activity and increase open park land at the same time.

The 4-year-old proposal still must be reviewed by other governmental bodies, such as the Planning Commission, before it reaches the council sometime this summer.

In a separate but related matter, the board voted yesterday to support a November bond measure that would provide money for renovation and restoration at Balboa Park and Mission Bay Park.

Other possible proposals for the ballot measure could include expenditures for a Japanese Garden and expansion of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and Science Center.

The recommendation was prompted by member Ann Hix, who wrote to Mayor O’Connor, voicing disapproval of several projects being considered for the ballot measure.

The bond review task force will hold a public hearing at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Community Concourse downtown.

In the master plan, a major restaurant is proposed for the scenic Marston Point, Spanish Village and at a planned &quot;golf complex.&quot; In addition to a restaurant, the complex also would have a new clubhouse. The nine-hole course would be rebuilt on a nearby landfill in the park.

The board also approved several of Pekarek’s recommendations, either in full or modified versions. These include.

  

 Approving the concept of an underground parking structure of more than 1,500 spaces at the San Diego Zoo, subject to &quot;parking policy considerations.&quot; The board wants the new structure to be open to all park visitors, as the existing lot is now. Doug Myers, executive director of the Zoological Society of San Diego, said no decision has been made on the use of a new facility or when construction might begin. 
 

The lot would cost between $9 million and $12 million in today’s dollars,

Myers said.

  

 Developing pedestrian malls in the Prado and prohibiting parking there, and turning the Palisades parking lot into a garden as it used to be. 
 

  

 Expanding the House of Pacific Relations and restoring the Palisades buildings 
 

which include the Balboa Park Club, the Municipal Gym and the Federal Building

  

 Adding 12,000 square feet to Spanish Village for a total of 35,000. 
 

  

 Moving scout campgrounds out of Balboa Park to Mission Trails Regional Park. 
 

  

 Building a new municipal gym (the existing one would be refurbished and open to other community uses) south of Jacaranda Drive around Morley Field. 
 

April 18, 1987, San Diego Union, B-3. Michael Abrams: Lockwood seeks ballot measure on parks bond issue.

April 20, 1987, San Diego Union, B-3, B-8. Jon Funabiki: Japanese garden plan is ready; Mayor to unveil model of proposed park attraction

San Diegans soon will be able to catch a peek at the Japanese Friendship Garden proposed for Balboa Park. But like the Japanese art of bonsai trees it will be in miniature.

A scale model of the 11.5 acre park, shrunk down to the size of a card table, will be unveiled by Mayor O’Connor at a ceremony on Thursday night.

The plan is patterned after the kai-yushiki style, which incorporates a circuitous path meant for strolling and viewing the mountain, pastoral and water scenes that the garden will offer.

Set in a portion of Gold Gulch canyon, adjacent to the Organ Pavilion, the proposed garden features two streams, a pond meant to represent an ocean inlet, and several traditional Japanese-style structures, including a tea house, garden house, cultural center, exhibit house and arbor.

The design was by Tokyo landscape architect Takeshi &quot;Ken&quot; Nakajima, who also was responsible for the gardens of the Japanese pavilions at the Montreal and Seattle World Fairs and the private garden of Japan’s late prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida.

The idea for constructing a garden was first raised by the San Diego-Yokohama Sister City Society in the 1960s. The City Council approved a master plan in 1979 and granted a 50-year lease for the site in 1984. The Japanese Friendship Garden Board, a nonprofit corporation, was created in 1980 to administer the project.

The city is considering placing a $70 million bond issue on next November’s ballot to finance major renovations for Balboa Park. Tentatively, the bond issue includes a $3 million allocation for the Japanese garden.

The allocation would be contingent on the garden board raising a matching amount from donations. The board has $750,000 in pledges.

The money would go toward the first phase of the project, which would cover about 5 acres and cost about $4.8 million. Groundbreaking is projected for October 1988.

The group hopes to generate public interest in the project by displaying the garden model at various locations around the city, probably starting next month, said David Roberts, executive director of the Friendship Garden Board. A schedule has not been finalized.

The project is intended to showcase traditional Japanese garden techniques and would include black pines, Japanese magnolias and flowering peach, apricot and plum trees.

In addition, the board hopes it will become a site for classes and demonstrations in ikebana , bonsai, martial arts and dramatic arts.

O’Connor, who has called the project &quot;a bridge of cultural understanding,&quot; will unveil the model at a ceremony for civic and business leaders at 7 p.m. Thursday in the Kitayama House restaurant at the Naiman Tech Center, a business park with a Japanese motif.

&quot;We are the only major city on the West Coast that has a port, but doesn’t have a Japanese garden,&quot; said Grace Brophy, secretary of the Japanese Garden Board, &quot;yet we have enormous cultural and economic ties with Japan and the Pacific Rim.&quot;

Roberts added, &quot;I think it’s really important that the Japanese and American community understand each other. This can help.&quot;

The City of Yokohama, San Diego’s sister city, has promised to contribute to the garden’s construction.

In fact, the project will be names San-kei-en --- &quot;three scenery garden&quot; --- the same name used for Yokohama’s Japanese garden. The name was proposed by Mitsuo Yokoyama, former chairman of the Japanese Institute of Landscape Architects, who has been a close adviser.

A Japanese tea garden was built in Balboa Park for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition and dismantled in the middle 1950s.

Since 1981, the Old Globe has spend $9.1 million in reconstruction costs for city-owned buildings. Of that total, the city and county of San Diego contributed $1.35 million. Clearly, the Old Globe has picked up a sizable portion of the tab for improvements to city-owned property.

The 6-0 action (of the Planning Commission) is the nest to last step in a six-year old debate about the future of the park, and reflects the &quot;environmentally preferred alternative&quot; to a consultant’s master plan proposal. That plan would have removed many of the unprofitable activities in the park and replaced them with commercial ventures to make money.

However, commissioners did go along with the Pekarek Group consultants’ recommendations to build a 600-space parking structure in Archery Canyon and another of undetermined size south of the Organ Pavilion on an existing parking lot.

The commission also recommended retention of youth group facilities for the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Camp Fire organizations on land proposed for zoo expansion.

In an interview after the commission meeting, (Mayor O’Connor) said she would oppose construction of a parking structure in Archery Canyon and a new municipal gym in Morley Field.

In Washington, meanwhile, restoration of Balboa Park’s administration building was given a boost when the House Appropriations Interior subcommittee approved $200,000 for the $1.2 million renovation project.

The project already has received $100,000 from the state office of Historic Preservation. Private contributors have raised another $180,000 and the city has earmarked an equal amount. The balance will be raised from private contributions and matching funds from the city.

The Marston Addition should be made part of Balboa Park or the land sold.

Florida Canyon should be made into an attractive and integral part of Balboa Park.

The Arizona landfill should be used for free outdoor recreation.

Land occupied by the Campfire Girls, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts should be

incorporated into the park.

Private leases should not be automatically extended when they expire.

As Balboa Park has reached the saturation point museums and other non-park

institutions should be encouraged to relocate elsewhere.

June 6, 1987, San Diego Tribune, D-2. A House Appropriations subcommittee has approved $200,000 to help pay for a $1.2 million renovation of the Balboa Park Administration Building.

June 11, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-1. Rita Calvano: Public Facilities and Recreation Committee supports closing bridge to Balboa Park.

A recommendation to close to vehicle traffic, Cabrillo Bridge, a main entrance to Balboa Park, and to keep traffic out of the park’s central area has gained the support of a San Diego City Council committee.

By a 3-1 vote, the council Public Facilities and Recreation Committee agreed to the closure and approved instead building another west entrance. Two parking garages were also agreed upon, and the committee wants a third structure behind the Spreckels Organ Pavilion to be given consideration.

. . . the committee approved a parking garage in Archery Canyon as well as a parking structure on the existing Zoo parking lot, although zoo officials had encouraged building a lot in Florida Canyon.

Other recommendations of the committee include limiting expansion of Spanish Village; keeping the scout campgrounds in the park; building no major restaurants; putting any new gymnasium outside the park; and moving the Centro Cultural de la Raza to another part of the park.

In the proposed Balboa Park-Mission Bay Park bond issue, Centro Cultural is not included in the list of facilities to be upgraded --- even though the roof leaks and the only restroom facilities are park facilities outside the building.

In addition, the Balboa Park Master Plan proposes demolition of the Centro Cultural building.

Councilwoman Judy McCarty said that the council probably will consider the unspecified increase in the 7 percent room tax next year. Deputy City Manager Jack McGrory said the city manager’s office probably will have a report on the matter in about six months.

The recommendation for pay parking at spots close to the park is meant to encourage people to park further away.

June 24, 1987, San Diego Tribune, A-1. Rita Calvano: The City Council yesterday decided voters in November to get choice of 2 park bond issues so that at least the smaller one had a chance of passing.

June 24, 1987, San Diego Union, B-1. Steve Schmidt: Park funding measures put on November ballot.

Voters will choose in November whether to spend nothing, $73 million or $94 million for improvements at Balboa Park and Mission Bay, the City Council decided yesterday.

June 25, 1987, Los Angeles Times, II-3:1-2. Voters to face multiple choice on Mission Bay and Balboa Park bonds, by Nancy Ray.

Voters will face a multiple choice question at the November 3 election on whether the want to pay the tab for improvements to Balboa and Mission Bay parks.

Long-debated bond issues for $74 million and $94 million will appear on the November ballot separately --- offering voters the choice of financing the repairs on Balboa Park buildings and the sewer line repairs to clean up Mission Bay or go for the frills of improving Fiesta Island and building a new municipal gymnasium to replace the old one which is being converted into an automobile museum.

Both general obligation bond issues would require two-thirds majority approval from voters. If both proposals passed, only the larger bond issue would be used.

Mayor O’Connor championed the bond issue, despite past election history showing that voters has approved only one city general obligation bond issue in the past 20 years.

During more than six hours of debate over the bond issues in committee and council meetings, council members have split over whether to seek to raise the park funds directly --- through general obligations bonds requiring a two-thirds approval --- or whether to form a citywide assessment district for park improvements which could be approved by a simple 50 percent majority vote.

Councilman Mike Gotch has argued that the assessment district would be more equitable because every homeowner in the city would be assessed an equal amount. Under the general obligation bond issue, he said, owners who purchased property before Proposition 13 went into effect in 1978 would play a smaller share because their property values were frozen at a much lower level than present market values.

Goth’s proposal failed to gain a majority from the council members after it was learned that a complicated assessment schedule for the city’s 400,000 property owners would have to be compiled at a cost of several million dollars.

The City Council voted Tuesday to place both bond issues on the ballot, reserving the assessment district approach as a future alternative if the bond issues fail.

Balboa Park improvements slated to be financed by the bond issue include:

  

 $31.5 million in renovation and safety improvements to existing buildings and arcades, including $11.5 million for the House of Hospitality, $5 million for the House of Charm and arcades, $3.1 million for the Balboa Park Club, $2.3 million for the Museum of Man, $1.6 million each for a municipal gym and the Museum of Man, $1.4 million for Casa de Balboa, $1.1 million each for the Old Globe Theater complex and the Federal Building and $550,000 for the Palisade Building. $2.5 million for vehicle circulation and pedestrian access improvements. 
 

The larger $94-millin bond issue would encompass all the previous projects and add:

In Balboa Park:

  

 $6 million for a new municipal gymnasium. $2.5 million for additional pedestrian and vehicle circulation and access improvements. $1.8 million each for Space Theater and Starlight Bowl improvements. 
 

One controversial issue yet to be decided is the construction of a parking garage within Balboa Park. The council’s Public Facilities and Recreation Committee voted Wednesday in favor of paid parking lots outside the park and an increase in the city hotel-motel tax to finance such improvements.

June 25, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-8. Eric Healy: Marston residence named historical site; Administration Building renovation OK’d.

June 29, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-6. OPINION: No parking fees, please.

Fees keep many of our poorest residents from visiting the zoo, the municipal golf course and some of the Balboa Park museums. But they have always been able to picnic in the park, walk along the Prado, play basketball at the municipal gym, attend at concert at the Organ Pavilion. Let’s not start a system that allows the affluent to pay for choice parking spaces while the poor --- the indigent elderly, mothers with small children or the handicapped --- park on the outskirts and wait for a tram.

The proposed ban on vehicles from the Palisades and El Prado areas, and elegant Cabrillo Bridge are amount about 30 park changes --- some minor, some controversial --- scheduled for debate July 27 before the City Council.

Balboa Park is the second largest urban park in the nation with 1,290 acres. Los Angeles 4,000-acre Griffith Park is the largest. (Note: I include this gross misstatement as an example of the accuracy of typical newspaper reports! rwa)

Because a new park master plan has yet to be adopted, officials are uncertain how they will raise much of the money needed to carry out the $75 million to $100 million in projects.

Up to $42 million could come from a pair of park bond measures facing voters in November.

The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater&amp;Science Center in Balboa Park plans a $17.5 million expansion that would double its size --- adding two more theaters, a teaching planetarium and an outdoor science park.

Construction on the project could begin in 1989, pending San Diego City approval and the availability of financing, center executive director Jeffrey W. Kirsch said.

&quot;We need more space,&quot; Kirsch said. &quot;The idea . . . is to provide us with an opportunity to give San Diego a world-quality, world-class science-theater complex.&quot;

Kirsch declined to make extensive comments about the proposed 55,000-square-foot expansion, saying he preferred to wait until a new conference scheduled for Monday.

Cris Fontana, head of the space complex’s board of trustees, also declined comment, saying the board wanted to notify its members before making the proposal public.

July 18, 1987, San Diego Tribune, C-1. Linda C. Puig: Zoo society chief, cultural leaders hit Balboa Park traffic proposals.

Leaders of 20 Balboa Park cultural institutions and the San Diego Zoo are banding to oppose a proposed parking plan, saying it could threaten their future by discouraging visitors.

In a July 10 letter to the San Diego City Council, presidents of 21 Balboa Park activities --- under the umbrella of the Central Balboa Park Association --- criticize parking and traffic elements of the proposed Balboa Park Master Plan.

Many of the letter-signers said they plan to air their concerns publicly when the master plan, also known as the Pekarek Plan, comes up for council ratification on July 27.

Another letter, from the Zoological Society of San Diego, urges its nearly 100,000 members to contact City Hall before July 27, terming the matter &quot;critical to the future of your San Diego Zoo.&quot; The Pekarek Plan would be a sweeping overhaul of Balboa Park recommending nearly 30 changes, including building a gymnasium in Morley Field and closing Cabrillo Bridge to autos. The changes would cost an estimated $75 million to $100 million.

The plan also proposes eliminating parking in El Prado, Palisades, Plaza de Panama and Alcazar Garden areas. It would fill the lots with landscaped walkways, linking the cultural complex and restoring parklike ambiance to areas that have grown clogged with autos circling in search of parking spaces.

In return, the plan proposes increasing the amount of parking by as much as 35 percent through the construction of new lots on the park’s periphery, including a large underground structure at the zoo, and improvements of existing ones.

In the letter to council members, the Central Balboa Park Association requests that the council:

  

 Enlarge the Spreckels Organ Pavilion parking lot by multiple decking. Build terraced parking in Florida Canyon and an overpass over Park Boulevard. Make the Cabrillo Bridge and Archery Canyon parking sites as large as possible. Retain parking in Alcazar Gardens and the Plaza de Panama. Not focus park traffic on the zoo parking lot. 
 

Cultural leaders at Balboa Park are mostly concerned that visitors faced with long walking distances won’t make the trip into the interior.

The institutions --- from the Museum of Man to the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater --- must have visitors to stay healthy, Philip M. Klauber, a signer of the letter, said Thursday. He is immediate past president of the San Diego Historical Society, which has its office in Balboa park.

&quot;They are in the business of serving the visiting public,&quot; Klauber said. &quot;The public has to be able to get to them . . .

&quot;Now, I love and enjoy (walking through the park) as much as anybody, but the average American doesn’t want to do that. He wants to park reasonably near the destination, and he wants to get in with a reasonable amount of traffic.&quot;

Pedestrians also are fearful of walking long distances in the dark, said Connie Monzingo-Fish, director of the San Diego Junior Theater, which puts on Friday night performances.

No one has forgotten, she said the murder of Old Globe actor David Huffman, who was stabbed to death in February 1985 by a thief he caught breaking into a parked motor home.

&quot;That doesn’t get forgotten too quickly,&quot; she said.

Making the zoo the focal point of parking would intensify already congested traffic in the zoo area and discourage visitors, Betty Jo F. Williams, president of the Zoological Society, wrote to members. &quot;The economic health of the zoo is greatly dependent on attendance and our attendance is linked to parking.,&quot; Williams wrote. Amy Krulak, president of the park association, said having to park so far from any of the cultural institutions within the park &quot;wouldn’t at all help the other end of the park.&quot;

&quot;All those places need more parking --- that’s all there is to it --- not less.&quot;

The interior parking lots have never provided a great deal of parking. All they have done is entice thousands of cars into the middle of the park, creating San Diego’s largest weekend traffic jam.

By parking on the edge of the park, visitors can enter a serene park where they need not worry about having their children run down, a place where they can breathe the air without a freeway-level dose of exhaust.

July 26, 1987, Los Angles Times, II, 1, 3, 4. Plan’s Vision of a Car-Free Heart Splits Friends of Balboa Park, by Jenifer Warren.

&quot;It’s hard enough for museums to drum up visitors as it is. With the bridge closed, you could have blockbusters every week and people would still not leave their cars and walk in. This is Southern California.&quot; . . . Doug Sharon, Director Museum of Man.

Betty Jo Williams president of the San Diego Zoological Society, has sent a letter urging the society’s 135,000 member households to fight the proposed construction of a 1,500-space parking structure on the existing lot at the San Diego Zoo. Williams called the proposal &quot;completely unrealistic&quot; and said it would saddle the zoo with the responsibility of housing the cars of all park patrons.

As an alternative, zoo officials propose keeping their existing lot and creating a set of terraced parking platforms on the western face of Florida Canyon.

Although reluctant to boot (the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Camp Fire Girls), the city proposes that a lease with the groups not be renewed when it expires in 2005. Camping activities can be better accommodated in Mission Trails Regional Park, officials say.

Today, only 14% of parkland is available for (strolling, picnicking and other passive uses), with the balance occupied by one use or another. Under the new plan --- and with the pending demolition of all but three of the 42 Naval Hospital buildings --- that figure will jump to 23%, Dave Twomey, assistant Park and Recreation director said.

July 26, 1987, San Diego Union, B-1. Gina Lubrano: Panda-Mania.

Two roly-poly black-and-white giant pandas from China that go on exhibit at 9 a.m. tomorrow pose the biggest challenge for the San Diego Zoo in its 71-year history.

Basi, a 7-year old female, and Yuan Yuan, a 6-year old male, are expected to be such a draw that the Zoo anticipates 1.5 million visitors --- 50 percent more than usual --- will go through the gates during their 200-day visit.

There’s a possibility that on some days, the park will be so crowded that the gates may have to close early to accommodate the flood of visitors.

&quot;Last year, we had 39,000 people on Founders Day (Oct. 6). The facility was tremendously overtaxed at that point,&quot; said Mike Ahlering, Zoo operations manager.

He couldn’t predict how many visitors it will take to close the gates. The deciding factor will be how many are in line to see the pandas and how long the wait becomes,&quot; he said.

&quot;We have a lot . . . to learn about what to do if we have those big crowds day after day,&quot; Ahlering said.

Peak times are expected on weekends during the summer, holidays, Christmas week, and all of October when children under 15 will be admitted free during the Kroc Family Children’s Days.

&quot;And guess what January is,&quot; said Douglas G. Myers, executive director of the Zoological Society. &quot;The pandas will be packing about Super Bowl time. It will be your last chance to see them until they come back permanently --- if that ever happens.&quot;

The latest about the pandas may be obtained by calling 55-PANDA, a 24-hour recorded message that includes information about Zoo hours and prices, the most recent attendance figures, parking information and, according to Zoo workers, &quot;any panda scoops of the day.&quot;

Visitor demands are anticipated to be so great that the Zoo has set up a satellite parking lot on city-owned land at Pershing Drive, across from the Balboa Park Golf Course. A free shuttle will run from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.

Ahlering estimates the lot will have 2,500 to 3,000 spaces and will supplement the Zoo’s own 3,150-space lot and two auxiliary lots that are normally used in the summer on Roosevelt Junior High School property. Those lots can hold about 650 vehicles.

The dirt lot opens tomorrow to handle some of the overflow, but will not be completed until later in the week, Ahlering said.

To help relieve the parking squeeze, Zoo employees are being asked to park at the old Sears store site on Cleveland Avenue and take a shuttle to work. The Zoo is leasing the lot from the city for $1,000 a month and is providing security not only for the lot but for the vacated building, Ahlering said.

The employee park plan was tested last year over the three-day Labor Day weekend, he added.

And if all this isn’t enough, signs have been put on the freeways to guide the way to the Panda exhibit.

&quot;We have had tremendous cooperation from city traffic engineers and Caltrans in rerouting traffic so we can get in and out of that lot more efficiently.

&quot;Our problem in the past has been the majority of the traffic from (Interstate) 5 north and south is routed on 163 and comes up Richmond (Street). What we’ve done is change the routing of 5 north and south to bring traffic to the Zoo on Pershing (Drive).

Some of the signs also will include a 30-inch-square plastic panda logo, he said.

The Zoo always hires seasonal workers in the summer to take care of the added crowds. This year, it will add 150 to 200 people more than usual. They will work in gift shops, help with the entrance lines, clean the grounds, work in food service and as parking lot attendants, Ahlering said.

Beginning Tuesday, the Zoo will operate on extended hours. Gates will open at 8 a.m. and close at 5:30 p.m. Visitors may remain on the grounds until 7:30 p.m.

Zoo officials advise visitors either to arrive early or late to beat the mid-day crush. Fewer people are expected on weekdays, about half as many people as visit the Zoo on weekends.

There are two ways for the public to see the pandas. The first is to pay the regular $8.50 admission for adults, $2.50 for children between 3 and 15, and walk to the panda pad.

Once inside the Zoo, visitors turn right at Flamingo Lagoon and follow the red flags to Panda Plaza. They must go past the bus boarding and unloading areas, past the koalas and the monkeys, the animal rides and the kopje exhibit, and then down Dog and Cat Canyon.

The quarter-acre Panda Plaza is located just past the Hunte Amphitheater, where visitors will line up along shaded queue lines that will snake back and forth past panda educational graphics, closed-circuit television and stands of bamboo.

A tiered viewing area will allow 150 people to observe Basi and Yuan at the same time.

People who don’t want to walk down the canyon and back also may see the pandas by taking one of the Zoo tour buses --- which costs admission plus $2.50 for adults and $2 for children between 3 and 15. While on the bus, riders will get a clear view of the exhibit because the road near the enclosure has been raised six feet.

Risser said the Zoo spent &quot;a little over a half million dollars&quot; on the panda project, which includes grading the satellite parking lot.

Home to Basi and Yuan Yuan is the old clouded leopard exhibit that has been renovated to accommodate their needs. It has been fitted with central air conditioning, large picture windows on three sides of laminated, shatter-proof glass, two separate sleeping areas and a landscaped exhibit of more than 1,200 square feet.

To make way for the pandas, the clouded leopards that occupied the area were moved to an off-exhibit area. The animals that occupy the holding area behind the Hunte Amphitheater also were moved.

In their new home, Basi and Yuan Yuan will be separated by bars but will be able to see each other and even touch noses. Separate quarters are nothing new for them. They are kept apart in the Fuzhou Zoo in China because pandas are naturally loners and can become aggressive if they live together.

The arrival of the pandas is the culmination of nearly 10 years of negotiations with Chinese officials. And to accommodate such a feat, Zoo officials are changing many of the rules they normally live by.

For instance, it is not in keeping with the San Diego Zoo’s philosophy to allow performances by animals because the Zoo encourages only the natural behavior of animals.

But the pandas brought along their teeter boards and bicycle --- for exercising.

Visitors who time it just right will be treated to the sight of Basi riding a bicycle or Yuan Yuan balancing on a board that teeters on a cylinder that rolls along a bench.

Both of them stand and walk on command, can wave either front paw an can twirl a baton. They can bounce and slam-dunk a basketball, push a baby stroller, sit at a table and play cards, sit in a chair and play a cello-like instrument with a bow and carry a broom and bucket around their enclosure.

There’s a reason for the way the Fuzhou Zoo animals are trained, said Art Risser, Zoo general manager.

It’s the philosophy of Chen Yu Cun, Fuzhou Zoo director, that close human contact and exercise sessions help pandas develop their dexterity and balance. Not only are the pandas physically fit, but they are responsive to commands. That allows Chen to do routine physical checkups, take their blood pressure, monitor their heartbeats, take rectal temperatures, collect urine and blood samples --- without sedating them.

&quot;What we’re doing is simply following what the Chinese have already set in motion and have opted not to try to alter any of their schedules,&quot; Risser said.

&quot;They are the Chinese animals; they are in control of the animals and we feel very privileges to have them visit. Further, we understand the value in the approach they have elected to take by instituting the exercise routine.&quot;

The exercises are so important to the animals that on Friday, the Chinese asked that the pool that has been installed in the exhibit for the pandas be removed to make more room for their routines.

Basi and Yuan Yuan arrived at Los Angeles International Airport shortly after noon Thursday amid media fanfare and a VIP reception from excited Zoo administrators. For the pair of pandas, it was a first time out of China and the animals appeared oblivious to the trip and the fuss.

However, they were so exhausted on Friday that they slept through the jarring sounds of jackhammers that tore out the pool, said Georgeanne Irvine, Zoo spokeswoman.

Instead of swims in the pool, the pandas will take showers. And they do so by holding the hose with attached showerheads themselves, Irvine said.

In another concession for the special visitors, the Zoo installed two trailers near the exhibit where the panda keepers will live so that they can be near their charges. In contrast, no Zoo keepers live on the grounds.

Trying to classify the giant panda into either the bear or raccoon family is dangerous --- scientists themselves don’t agree. Although they resemble bears with big round bodies, they are akin to raccoons because they eat like them.

Basi and Yuan Yuan weigh less than 200 pounds each and are about 5 feet tall when standing. To keep them in tip-top condition, they will be fed fruits, whole grains and vitamins. But they will have a bamboo supplement --- about 22 pounds each a day.

Zoo officials estimate that they will munch about 4-1/2 tons of bamboo during their stay.

Types of bamboo that the pandas find tantalizing grow abundantly on Zoo grounds. But if the Zoo runs out, it will raid supplies at the Wild Animal Park and may call on the Quail Botanical Garden in Encinitas, which has volunteered to serve as a back-up bamboo source.

Chuck Coburn, Zoo horticulturist, said to keep up with demands, one person is being assigned to do nothing but locate, harvest, wash, store and deliver fresh bamboo to the pandas.

Zoo officials acknowledge they are making a gift to the Chinese in exchange for the panda visit, but would not say what that gift will be. &quot;We deal in friendship, and friendship means trust,&quot; Myers said.

&quot;Nine, 10 years ago, the thought of pandas or golden monkeys or tapins (animals closely related to the musk ox) may have been considered unrealistic,&quot; Myers said. Golden monkeys already are on exhibit at the Zoo and the tapins are expected soon, Myers added.

&quot;Our friendship with the Chinese has allowed us many unbelievable animals.&quot;

July 27, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-6. EDITORIAL: Park’s dirty linen is showing.

There are two Balboa Parks --- a lovely &quot;Hollywood front: and its barren, ugly backside.

The better-known Balboa Park is a lush, green strip along its peripheries, with palm-filled canyons, golf fairways, grassy picnic areas, flowers and eucalyptus groves. The other, at its center, is so scarred, neglected and haphazardly developed that San Diegans generally don’t think of it as a park.

And why should they? Most of the trees, the stream, the wild vegetation of south Florida Canyon are gone, replaced by the cut-and-fill and massive concrete structures of the new and old Navy hospitals. Viewed from Pershing Drive, the huge urban-style hospital buildings dwarf the canyon and the Prado museums nearby. Farther along Pershing lines the unsightly reminder that the center of Balboa Park was once a garbage dump. Although the old Arizona landfill was closed in 1974, it sill sinks and oozes methane gas. Nothing grows there. The city recently poured dirt, oil and sand over it so that it can be used for extra parking while the giant Pandas are on exhibit at the zoo.

Just beyond the dump, near Morley Field, earthmovers and bulldozers tear up a strip of land that is 130 feet wide and 800 feet long. It is the site of the park’s new $2.5 million nursery, which had to be relocated from Park Boulevard to make way for the new Navy Hospital. The park needs a convenient place, of course, to nurture 58 varieties of plants and trees. But the nursery nibbled away at land that should have been saved for park and recreation uses.

Also on the east side of Florida Canyon is the eyesore of a Park and Recreation maintenance yard, surrounded by chain-link fences. It doesn’t belong there, but no one can figure out where else to put it.

The unsightly core of Balboa Park cries out for a master plan that the city will respect and observe. The park’s core should have been reserved for the open-space and recreational needs of a growing city --- not for dumps, temporary parking lots and maintenance yards. There are the unfortunate products of expedient, piecemeal actions, given little or no public scrutiny.

The Pekarek Plan, which the City Council is due to start considering today, contains fine proposals for extending our park into this central area between park Boulevard and Pershing (Drive). We particularly support those that would create more landscaped greenbelts and open space for park users and evict the inappropriate users from its abused core.

The procession of dump trucks on Pershing, the sounds of grading, the acrid smell of oil sprayed on a temporary zoo parking lot tell us that time is running out. The city must adopt a plan that will clean up the park’s blighted back yard.

August 24, 1987, San Diego Union, B-3. Gina Lubrano: Chinese visitors lure 25% more.

San Diego Zoo attendance is up by about 25 percent during the first weeks of the pandas’ visit, about half of the projections for the 200-day exhibit, but Zoo officials are not complaining. &quot;I would lay awake at night before the start and think everyone was going to show up on the same day,&quot; said Douglas Myers, executive director of the Zoological Society of San Diego.

He expects final attendance figures will reflect the projected 50 percent increase --- a half million more visitors than last year for the same period --- or even more.

Instead of a beginning deluge, the visitor load during the first three weeks --- which is a normally high attendance period --- increased an average of 25.3 percent --- or by 83,447 visitors. The pandas --- Basi and Yuan Yuan --- are expected to boost attendance during normal low periods, after Labor Day and between winter holidays.

During the first three weeks, the lowest attendance was on opening day --- July 27 --- when 15,320 persons went to the Zoo. Even so, that was a 25.4 percent increase over last year.

Attendance was nearly 9,000 greater on its biggest day --- Saturday, August 15. The gate of 24,194 was well below the record 39,000 people last October t --- Founders Day --- when admission was free and park facilities were severely overtaxed.

Percentage wise, the biggest day in the first three weeks was July 30 --- a Thursday --- when attendance was up 44.2 percent.

Those who theorize that visitors stayed away the first few weeks because they were afraid of huge lines may be correct. Attendance started taking big jumps last week --- it was up 57 percent on Monday, 65.1 percent on Tuesday and 47.4 percent on Wednesday. So far, the lines have been manageable --- with the maximum wait to see the pandas about 20 minutes, Myers said. That’s been in the middle of the day and on a weekend, Myers said.

Waits have been longer to get into the Zoo and to go on the bus tour. &quot;Our fear was that we’d gridlock the city,&quot; he said of preparations for crowd control. But that hasn’t happened &quot;because of the cooperation of Balboa Park, CalTrans, the city, the parks and recreation department, the transit company, Ace Parking and the special events task force of the police department.&quot;

Traffic has been rerouted from Interstate 5; an auxiliary visitor parking lot has been set up, and Zoo employees are being shuttled to work from the old Sears parking lot.

&quot;All those people working together has made the first month of pandas run so smoothly,&quot; Myers said.

Myers has reasons for his optimism about final attendance figures. Most of the people who have visited the pandas during their first three weeks on exhibit have been out-of-towners. The most loyal of Zoo-goers --- members of the Zoological Society --- have stayed away. &quot;The membership rate is half of what it normally is,&quot; he said. That’s been at the urging of the society, and there’s a reason for it, Myers sad. Special members’ days will be held during September and October.

After Labor Day and through October, the Zoo will open at 8 a.m., as it does at present --- but early admission for each of seven weeks will be limited to groups of about 20,000 society members. Jeff Jouett, Zoo spokesman, said he expects on some days, numbers will be small enough to give visitors longer than normal periods to view Basi an Yuan Yuan.

Myers also suspects that many San Diego residents who are not society members are waiting for visitors to go home before going to the Zoo. Neither Myers nor other Zoo officials will say what the society paid to Chine to get the pandas here. Renovations to the exhibit, which includes sleeping quarters for the panda trainers, were estimated at about $500,000.

One bench mark of the financial success of the historic panda visit is the sale of panda merchandise, which Jouett said is breaking previous records.

&quot;They’re far ahead of what they thought,&quot; said Jouett, who would not release totals for competition reasons.

Initially, merchandisers anticipated each visitor would spend a minimum of 40 cents. That expectation was more than surpassed on opening day with the per capital spending at the panda shop averaging $2.21 for each visitor.

Since July 27, the Zoo has sold nearly 100,000 of the 144,000 panda T-shirts on hand. Merchandisers are scrambling to reorder and are finding that they have competition with others in San Diego who want to sell panda shirts.

Jouett said panda T-shirts are on sale at Lindbergh Field, at a nearby deli and even at competing Sea World, which has its own stock of panda merchandise.

Another bench mark of the pandas’ success is a brisk business in the sale of society memberships. During the month that included the first two weeks of the pandas’ visit, sale of memberships at the Zoo entrance nearly doubled over last year --- from 876 to 1,508. While attendance is up at the Zoo, it has slumped at the Wild Animal Park, the other facility operated by the society.

Tom Hanscom, park spokesman, said three has been a drop of 19.1 percent compared to last year during the first three weeks of the pandas’ visit. He blames the decline on the park’s cancellation of headliner concerts that drew performers such as the Kingston Trio. &quot;It’s not the panda effect, but the concert effect,&quot; Hanscom said.

August 25, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-7. OPINION, Richard Amero: City should ignore some park advice

On July 27, the San Diego City Council returned proposals for a master plan for Balboa Park to the Parks and Recreation Board for consideration of alternatives suggested by members of the local branch of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and by Councilwoman Celia Ballesteros.

The AIA wants to keep Cabrillo Bridge open to traffic and to build a parking structure behind the Organ Pavilion. Ballesteros wants a parking garage on the site of the present Naval Hospital [sic]. The Park and Recreation Board is to hold hearings on these alternatives on September 21 and then present its findings to the City Council. As the Park and Recreation Board already has studied traffic and parking proposals for Balboa Park, it is unlikely than random and fanciful solutions by members of the AIA and by politicians are going to change their views.

The current plans, as endorsed by the Park and Recreation Board, attempts to remedy traffic and parking problems for all sections of the park. The new alternatives are not inhibited by a knowledge of how non-park and park traffic interfere with one another or how any kind of vehicular park traffic endangers life and property. They dazzle by their novelty, but they do not ensure a pleasant park experience.

The AIA plan intensifies traffic from Cabrillo Bridge to President’s Way, ruins the view from the Organ Pavilion colonnade and compounds the bottleneck on President’s Way.

Ballesteros’ plan forces people to park far away from the zoo and museums and obliges them to cross Park Boulevard. If Ballesteros wants garage on the old Naval Hospital site to accommodate parking for patrons of downtown, the community college, high school and Balboa Stadium, she may have found a logical use for it. But the use of park land for such non-park purposes should not be a recommendation for a Balboa Park master plan, and funding for same should not come from a strapped park and recreation budget. Last-minute Rube Goldberg proposals for Balboa Park from instantaneous experts play into the hands of the Central Balboa Park Association and the San Diego Zoological Society. These organizations would kill the master plans for Balboa Park, as these plans would curb their autonomy.

Key proposals of the Balboa Park master plan, which the City Council was reluctant to approve on July 27, should be supported by people who go to the park to enjoy its outdoor attractions.

These proposals have been analyzed and modified by PRC Engineering, the Park and Recreation Department and the city manager’s office. The council, through its inaction July 27, showed it was incompetent to deal with public park and recreation issues. The council’s unwillingness to champion the public park aspects of Balboa Park was in keeping with its previous decisions to eject dancers and athletes from the Palisades and to replace open space in Belmont Park with a shopping mall.

Items proposed by the new master plan and which the Central Balboa Park Association and the San Diego Zoological Society oppose are the closing of Cabrillo Bridge to automobile traffic, the diversion of traffic to a parking lot north of Cabrillo Bridge and to a parking structure in Archery Canyon, the opening of the Plazas de Panama and Pan American to pedestrians, and the use of the parking lot east of the zoo entrance for all-purpose parking.

While exact statistics regarding visitor participation in Balboa Park’s multiple activities are not available, this writer estimates , on the basis of an average daily attendance of 33,000 in 1987, that 20 percent of visitors go to the central area to enjoy its outdoor attractions, 10 percent go to museums and theaters, 35 percent go to the zoo and 35 percent go to Balboa Park areas other than the zoo and central section.

This would amount to 6,600 people daily for outdoor attractions on the central mesa, 3,300 for museums and theaters, 11,550 for the zoo and 11,550 for picnicking, sports, golf and other outdoor activities elsewhere in the park.

Outdoor activities are the park’s biggest draw with or without the inclusion of the zoo.

According to the 1960 Bartholomew planners, 67 percent of the participants in all park activities are from San Diego, city and county, whereas 72 percent of the zoo’s visitors are from outside the city and county.

The people of the city and county, not the outsiders, pay for the operation of Balboa Park through their property taxes and through their elected representatives.

What is good for museums and theater-goers in Balboa Park is bad for ordinary park visitors, as paid indoor activities and free outdoor activities conflict with one another.

Unlike most city parks, Balboa Park has a collection of buildings in its central core of varying architectural merit that some people like to look at from the outside. Many San Diegans take out-of-town visitors on Sunday afternoon automobile tours of the grounds.

This is why pedestrians must contend with bumper-to-bumper traffic from Cabrillo Bridge to President’s Way.

El Prado and its Plaza de Panama and the Palisades and its Plaza de Pan America were planned for the expositions of 1915-1916 and 1935-1936 as great pedestrian spaces.

Except for prominent guests arriving in automobiles, people arrived by street car at the east gate or walked through the Ocean or west gate. They could leave their automobiles on paid lots outside, but not on the exposition grounds.

The attractively landscaped plazas were the scene of parades, drills, athletic events, pageants, dances and band concerts, and could be so again.

Perhaps the center of Balboa Park can never achieve the colorful patina and historical significance of the great plazas of Italy and France from which automobiles have been banned, but they can generate the conviviality and charm of plazas at Disney land and Tivoli Gardens.

The proposed master plan contains provisions for adequate close-in parking for the central core.

There currently are 540 parking spaces in the Plazas de Panama and Pan American and the parking lot south of the Alcazar Gardens. By doing away with these spaces and building a parking lot in Archery Canyon and a parking lot near the Old Globe Theater, this number can be raised to 690.

Additional parking can be gained by developing or expanding parking behind the Conference and Federal Buildings.

Whether the zoo likes it or not, automobile traffic and demands for parking are going to increase on Park Boulevard during the projected 20-year life of a new master plan.

Environmental groups will fight to prevent the building of a parking lot in Florida Canyon to take care of this increased traffic. When the need arises, the City Council should follow the master plan’s recommendation by taking custody of the parking lot east of the zoo entrance and readapting it to accommodate more automobiles. The zoo should recognize that it has achieved its maximum growth in Balboa Park.

Without an easy and enticing access to El Prado from the parking lot east of the zoo entrance, there can be no rejuvenated Spanish Village, a facility that exists today in a state of suspended animation. A fast-food restaurant might be the catalyst that would bring Spanish Village to life.

The city cannot supply elderly or disabled persons with curb access to their favorite indoor attractions in Balboa Park, but it can provide them with reserved parking spaces as close as possible. Museums and theaters should provide their patrons with night security, shuttles and escalators.

Some minor extrinsic details of the proposed master plan, such as the location of the municipal gymnasium, golf course, Centro Cultural de la Raza, and the Boy Scout and Girl Scout camps, can be amended without jeopardizing the entire plan, but the traffic and parking proposals for the central area cannot be set aside, because they are the foundation of a successful Balboa Park master plan. The city cannot improve Balboa Park by doing nothing.

It already has spent $370,000 on a new master plan.

John Nolen in 1927, a citizens’ study committee in 1957, the Harland Bartholomew planners in 1960, a special Balboa Park committee in 1976, the Pekarek Group in 1983, and PRC Engineering, the Park and Recreation Board and the city manager’s office in 1987 have recommended a loop road to keep automobiles from destroying the pedestrian experience and outdoor beauty of El Prado and the Palisades.

When the City Council reconsiders the Balboa Park master plan on September 21, it should be guided by expert professional advice and not by the demands of those who can’t see beyond their own noses.

September 3, 1987, READER, 5. The Big Frieze, by Paul Krueger.

Antique auto buffs will soon displace fold dancers as tenants of Balboa Park’s Conference Building, but the car fanciers are grinding their gears over a plan to renovate the historic fifty-two year old building. That structure, like the neighboring municipal gymnasium and the Federal Building was designed by noted architect Richard Requa for the 1935 international exposition and is listed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. Though the million-dollar rehabilitation proposed by auto museum supporters would retain much of the Conference Building’s original character, it calls for the installation of two large panes of glass above the front doors and tiles to cover a portion of the outside walls.

But the secretary of the city’s Historic Site Board balks at those changes. He wants the remodeling to adhere even more strictly to architect Requa’s design, which means no new glass, no new tiles, and the addition of a thin strip of intricate plaster handiwork that once decorated the building’s exterior. &quot;We should restore it as closely as possible [or] at least not preclude doing things at a later date,&quot; says site board secretary Ron Buckley.

Members of the site board met last week to review the museum’s remodeling plans and to debate secretary Buckley’s counterproposal, which he bases on original architectural drawings and old photos of the Conference Building. The result was a mixed decision. Though Buckley had urged site board members to reject museum architect Donald Goldman’s plan to cover an eight-foot-tall by sixty-foot-long section of the exterior walls with glazed tile, the board agreed with Goldman’s opinion that the tile swath is necessary to protect the walls from graffiti and scruff marks inflicted by inconsiderate park visitors. But the board members agreed with Buckley’s suggestion that the museum tenants attempt to re-create the long, thin plaster frieze decorated with Mayan motifs that once covered a portion of those walls. And they don’t want any glass installed above the museum doors.

Museum architect Goldman says he’ll begin the search for experts who can cast plaster reproductions of the frieze, thought he’s worried that the job might be a very expensive one --- if it can be done at all.

&quot;The only way to do it is one-hundred percent right,&quot; warns Goldman. And he says his clients don’t mind hanging decorative banners where they’d proposed the glass. Buckley, however, may not drop his opposition to the new tiles.

That could delay the remodeling project, which is scheduled to begin early next year and be finished by next summer.

Architect Goldman seems satisfied with the site board’s initial comments, but he’s a bit distressed that he didn’t learn of the board’s review power until &quot;this late in the game.&quot; He says city officials have given him conflicting comments on the Historic Site Board’s power --- Buckley says it’s &quot;advisory&quot; to the city manager and council --- but Goldman has learned it’s expedient to cooperate. &quot;If you cross them and raise a big stink, it’ll cause you more of a problem than if you just do what they say,&quot; he comments.

September 3, 1987, READER. Color Them Gone, Balboa Park’s Future May Be In The Wrong Hands, 1, 10, 11, 12, 13 14, 15.

In the next few weeks, the San Diego City Council will be grappling with a proposed master plan for Balboa Park. In all, there are now six alternatives to that original plan, drawn up by San Diego consultant Ron Pekarek, and they reflect an utter lack of consensus on how to plot the future of San Diego’s urban oasis. One way to understand how such discord has crippled attempts to write a new plan is to go back and inspect an old plan --- the one drawn up by Samuel Parsons in 1903.

Many people mark (the) world’s fair [sic], which celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal, as the seminal event in the creation of one of the country’s great urban parks. Yet in fact, it was also the main reason for all the dissent today over how to play the park’s future. For if the expo buildings hadn’t been constructed, later restored, and finally handed over to some of the city’s cultural institutions, the park might still be primarily a park , rather than what it has become: a hybridized collection of competing interests, where sacred cultural cows have become dependent on the automobile and where the most important tenants --- the trees and plants --- have been ignored and forgotten.

Is it possible for the cultural interests and the horticultural interests to coexist harmoniously in Balboa Park? This is the central question that the proposed master plan fails to resolve. Plenty of trees and plants have lived and died and disappeared, and may more will be removed for further building expansion in the future. When are buildings ever removed from the park?

One reason that the Pekarek Plan and its alternatives lack anything approaching a cohesive vision is precisely because there isn’t a landscape plan with which to provide a starting point, a context for planning the rest of the park.

In San Diego, making the plant collection a top priority would necessitate a reversal of the institutional inertia that began to tip in favor of the special interests as far back as the Panama-California Exposition and which was reinforced after the second world’s fair in the park, held in 1935.

September 10, 1987, READER. Letter, Richard Amero in answer to Neal Matthew’s article, September 7. The Petrified Park. 

Neal Matthews has shown he can change his mind about Balboa Park (&quot;Color Them Gone,&quot; September 7). Perhaps, if he can escape the lure of the botanists and can read The Politics of Park Design by Dr. Galen Cranz, he may further transform his views.

At the moment, Matthews equates parks with trees and plants and leaves out people.

Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., Samuel Parsons, Jr., and John C. and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. planned their parks for people to enjoy. As social egalitarians, they regarded their parks as expressions of democracy in action.

In their designs, they alternated open green spaces and trees to create an illusion of vast spaces bordered by forests.

Parsons was fascinated by the views outward from San Diego’s great city park, views within of miniature canyons, and the desert-like terrain. He advised against giving the park a greensward (i.e., Eastern) treatment.

Kate Sessions and George W. Marston backed Parsons, but amateur botanists in the city insisted on lawns, flower beds and expensive irrigation systems.

As a consequence of the work of the local Floral Society, the first exposition was given the title of &quot;San Diego Garden Fair.&quot; Helter-skelter planting for the exposition produced flash-pan results, but the aftermath was anarchy. Eucalyptus towered over the California Tower, acacias became messy, and lush growth hid buildings.

After the first exposition, Balboa Park became &quot;a city within a city,&quot; but lost the rural Eden within a city that the Olmsteds and Parsons had envisioned.

The Olmsteds and Parsons did not want to turn their tree-bordered meadows into zoos and botanic gardens. They said such displays should be placed outside public parks.

It may be possible to locate small gardens in inconspicuous places within Balboa Park, as at Golden Gate Park, where sequestered and sheltered nooks do not detract from the interlocking landscape. The zoo has planted trees and shrubs alongside trails with labels indicating their scientific and vernacular names. Passers-by are within eye but not hand distance. Most of the plants are exotic and expensive and require careful nurturing. Balboa Park should not duplicate the botanic extravagance of the zoo because of the costs and because people would steal the plants.

Much of the horticulture in Balboa Park exhibits the same insensitivity and disorder as do the buildings. Flowers and trees are planted in awkward places. If enough trees grow in rows close to one another, as they do on the former lawn east of Eighth Avenue Drive and south of El Prado, people will not sit there. If enough trees form an impassable barrier, as they do on the slopes near the Quince Street overpass, children and adults will not play under their branches. If enough spindly palms rise high in the air, as they do in front of the Palisades Building, the architectural scale of the buildings will become ridiculous.

Unrelated gardens along the west rim of Florida Canyon are all foreground. At close view, they offer specimens of value, but, as a landscape composition, they are incoherent. Rare agave and cacti and prize roses disappear quickly.

A new master plan should have a horticultural element, as did the 1959 Balboa Park Citizens Study and the 1960 Bartholomew Plan. This element should embrace the entire park and blend the landscape details so that they please the eye and invite visitors to linger and to play. Baseball diamonds between Middle and South Drives in Golden Gate Park are surrounded by a natural amphitheater and not by wooden or concrete bleachers.

In keeping with the wishes of the Olmsteds and Samuel Parsons, landscaping in Balboa Park should be simplified, pruned and periodically thinned so people can interact with it and with one another.

A secret that Olmsted, Sr. understood is how to balance public focuses, such as the Bethesda Fountain in Central park, with personal spaces, such as the Ramble. Each enhances the other visually and socially as each offers a different and contrasting kind of personal experience.

We can petrify Balboa Park with too many artificial botanic gardens just as easily as we can petrify a park with too many roads, parking lots and buildings.

San Diego does not have a government; it has a predatory, scheming, inept bunch of parasites who leech off this city every chance they get. Citizens deserve this shit because they take it. It is time to fight back in any way we can.

September 17, 1987, READER. Letter, Carol N. Landsman, on the Matthews’ article.

I’ve been following the Balboa Park master planning process for more than four years now and have to take issue with Neal Matthew’s statement that the seven master plan alternatives &quot;reflect an utter lack of consensus on how to plot the future&quot; of Balboa Park (&quot;Color Them Gone,&quot; September 3).

On many points, six sets of recommendations are generally in agreement, although it is true that they often differ from the recommendations of master plan consultant Ron Pekarek. Major parking and access issues (Should the Laurel Street bridge be closed or left open? Should parking structures be built, and, if so, where?) still need to be resolved, but this should not overshadow the extent to which substantial concurrence has been achieved regarding the future of the park.

Mr. Matthew’s article does clearly point out the need to address landscaping problems and performs a valuable public service by letting people know what a poor job we have all done as custodians of this incredible resource and treasure. In November, when San Diegans go to the polls, I hope they will also understand that the bond issue represents only a small part of Balboa Park’s overall needs, which we have collectively disregarded for too long.

September 17, 1987, READER. Letter Tanja Winter, La Jolla, who congratulates Neal Matthew’s for his courage.

Congratulations to Neal Matthews for his fine article on Balboa Park. It takes courage to tell it like it is.

Especially shocking is the new naval hospital, illegally constructed, in violation of both the spirit and the letter of the law. It is a monstrosity, taking up large amounts of valuable and scarce park space, which was essentially stolen from the people of San Diego.

The proposed expansion of the space theater is equally unjustified. Greedy and thoughtless encroachment on public park space must be stopped. No now or expanded building of any kind should be allowed, in order to protect the park’s legitimate purpose: preservation of the &quot;restful beauty of nature.&quot;

Ironically, in the midst of the current building mania, which encourages commercial expansion, the present plan simultaneously calls for the destruction of Centro Cultural de la Raza, a unique, non-profit cultural center that has for years provided space for artists, dance classes, photo and art exhibits, and performance space. Could it be that the Centro was singled out for demolition precisely because it serves the Chicano community and is non-profit?

We should demand that members of the San Diego City Council fully commit themselves to the preservation of open and park spaces and show greater sensitivity to the cultural diversity of our community.

September 24, 1987, READER, Letter, Bernard Conrad, Golden Hill, claiming Neal Matthew’s &quot;hit the nail directly on the head in his article about the planning (or lack of planning) in Balboa Park.&quot;

What has truly happened is that a small city has been built within the original 1400 acres designated Balboa Park and that city wants to grow. Trained animal exhibits, Big Olaf concessions, laser rock shows, gift shops, restaurants, theaters, and future plans for grandiose parking structures and supportive roadways. Typical also is the &quot;hunger-panic&quot; for the tourist dollar that we never seem to get enough of. &quot;Feed me,&quot; the monster cries. &quot;FEED ME!&quot;

Approximately three-fourths of Balboa Park has been paved, built upon or fenced off for special interests, while the original concept of the park has been lost in the paper shuffle. But does the public realize that there are plans on the table today to increase the amount of traffic into the center of the park, eradicate natural canyons in favor of parking structures and buildings and roads --- and nowhere in those plans is &quot;nature&quot; (what’s that?) considered, other than to augment of disguise the growth of the inner-park city: the City of Balboa Park.

October 27, 1987, San Diego Tribune, A-1, A-6. Rita Calvano: City voters will decide on bay, park bond issue.

A week from today, San Diego residents will answer the question of whether to tax themselves for the next 30 years to clean up the water in Mission Bay and give several of the buildings in Balboa Park a new lease on life.

If they answer yes to Proposition B for $93.5 million, or to Proposition C for $73.8 million, that means there could be fewer sewage spills and resultant noise pollution in Mission Bay and fewer health hazards.

And in Balboa Park, the House of Hospitality and the partially condemned House of Charm would be rebuilt and several other structures that house museums or other cultural institutions there would be improved, repaired and upgraded.

&quot;We’re asking (voters) to save, restore and preserve . . . Balboa Park and Mission Bay Park,&quot; Mayor O’Connor said.

As premier attractions in San Diego, these parks receive millions of visitors a year who go to Balboa Park for art and cultural history, the Old Globe Theater or Starlight Opera outdoor theater and several forms of recreation.

Mission Bay Park is the scene for water sports, jogging and sunbathing.

Both parks are favorite picnic spots.

Proponents of the bond measures include such organizations as the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, the San Diego Taxpayers Association and the Sierra Club.

The Libertarian Party and the United Taxpayers of San Diego oppose the measures, saying that the bonds are too expensive a way to pay for the improvements.

Both groups, whose representatives wrote ballot arguments in opposition, say that the repairs should come out of the regular city budget and that much of the money for them could be raised by charging visitors to park at the attractions.

&quot;I don’t think that there’s a lot of quarrel about the need for the repairs,&quot; said Dick Rider, vice chairman of the Libertarian Party of San Diego. &quot;The question is who should pay for them and why hasn’t the city budgeted for this in the past.&quot;

Added Jack R. Sanders, president of the recently formed United Taxpayers of San Diego: &quot;We are really mad that they (the city) came out for new taxes before they made any attempt at all to make the parks more self-supporting.&quot;

Each measure requires a two-thirds vote for approval. The $93.5 million in bonds would be sold if both were authorized.

Proposition B could raise taxes by as much as $24 per $100,000 of assessed property value; Proposition C as much as $18 per $100,000 of assessed property value. But the actual tax rate could fluctuate for a couple of reasons while the bonds were being paid off.

&quot;As the total assessed valuation increases citywide, the percentage that each land owner (pays) will decrease (because) the tax burden is spread over a larger base,&quot; city economist Jack Farris said.

The actual cost of the bonds will depend on interest rates. For example, at a 9 percent interest rate, which Farris said is plausible, the $73.8 million bond would cost $213 million, and the $93.5 million bond would cost $272 million, Farris said.

Mission Bay Park would receive $46.9 million under Proposition B; $37.9 million under Proposition C. Both measures would provide $25.1 million for an improved sewer system and new storm drains to greatly reduce sewage contamination in Mission Bay where odors and pollutants sometimes drive people away, if they’re not already cautioned by the city to stay out of the bay because of potential health hazards.

A project to shore up the bay --- actually to put more sand there --- and the purchasing of equipment to prevent further erosion are also included in the $25.1 million.

These measures also would include $8.6 million to develop the South Shores area of Mission Bay; $1.7 million to add new and improved restrooms; $2.5 million to build pedestrian and bicycle paths from Sail Bay to East Crown Shores; $1 million to improve parking and traffic circulation.

The additional $9 million under Proposition B would include $7 million for improvements to Fiesta Island.

Under Proposition B, Balboa Park would receive $46.6 million instead of the $36 million that would become available under Proposition C.

Both propositions would provide money to tear down and rebuild the House of Hospitality and the House of Charm, necessities because the structures are falling apart, said John Leppert, assistant to the city manager. They are two of several buildings constructed for either of the two international expositions, one of which was held in 1915, the other in 1935.

The House of Hospitality, which would cost $11.5 million to rebuild, is used for banquets and weddings but also leases out much of its space to community organizations. The Café del Rey Moro, the main restaurant in the park, also is there.

The House of Charm has little activity in it now because it’s partially condemned. It would cost about $5 million to rebuild the house and its arcades.

Other buildings that would receive attention are the Museum of Man ($2.35 million); Old Globe Theater ($1.1 million); Museum of Art ($1.57 million); Casa de Balboa ($1.39 million); Natural History Museum ($2.15 million); Centro Cultural de la Raza ($250,000); Balboa Park Club ($3 million); Palisades Building ($550,000); Federal Building ($1 million); Municipal Gym ($1.5 million); and development of a Japanese Garden ($2 million); traffic circulation and other changes to make it easier for drivers, pedestrians and others to use the park, including the handicapped for whom wheelchair ramps would be built and other improvements made to make the park more accessible ($2.5 million).

Improvements on the buildings would differ from one to another, but generally would include new heating systems to replace the old-fashioned boilers, steel-framed doors to replace wooden ones, and new floors and roofs.

&quot;These are things that have been put on back burners for years and years because the city hasn’t had money to replace them,&quot; Leppert said. &quot;So now, we’re going to the voters with a real program and saying, ‘There are the things that need to be done. This is how much it’s going to cost,’ and hopefully, they will provide the money.&quot;

The additional $10 million in improvements to Balboa Park under Proposition B would include $6 million for a municipal gymnasium to be built outside Balboa Park and another $2.5 million for more improvements to make traffic circulation and pedestrian accesses more efficient.

The city council decided on two ballot measures to give people a choice, hoping that would encourage voters to approve a least the lesser amount.

&quot;Definitely, please vote on (at least) the minimum . . . ,&quot; O’Connor said. &quot;Obviously, it would be nice to have (Proposition) B, which costs a little bit more but gets us a lot more.&quot;

The San Diego Chamber of Commerce prefers the measure for the larger amount.

&quot;We think that Balboa Park is a precious resource for the city and that the need for improvement in Balboa Park has been established,&quot; said Dot Migdal, a chamber vice president. &quot;And we need to protect against sewage failures in Mission Bay.&quot;

Mark Nelson, executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Association, said his organization traditionally has supported such bond proposals &quot;as the most equitable method of financing large capital improvement projects when other money is unavailable.&quot;

He said the improvements that would come from a successful bond election are needed, &quot;without question.&quot;

Rider says many of the improvements could be financed simply by charging parking fees to visitors to the parks.

&quot;It’s crazy to have free parking,&quot; Rider said.

O’Connor thinks otherwise.

&quot;I am not going to do that,&quot; she said. &quot;The sentiment in this community is not to charge for parking at the beaches and at our parks.&quot;

She said the repairs could not be budgeted for because Proposition 13, a property tax-cutting measure passed in 1978, cut too much from city revenues.

The board said that is approval was in concept only and that it still wants all cars kept out of the center of the park someday. This could happen only if the bridge were closed.

The board agreed yesterday to discard the idea of an entrance at Quince Street on the park’s west side.

The board approved the possibility of a parking garage at te site of the parking lot behind the Organ Pavilion.

The board voted against extending 28 th Street to Grape Street.

It endorsed the idea of building a gymnasium on San Diego City College property.

The board approved moving the Park and Recreation Department’s maintenance yard from the Arizona landfill to a part of the parkland that the city will received from the Navy next year.

November 7, 1987, San Diego Tribune, D-3. Letter, T. S. Schumaker, AIA: Develop Balboa Park’s eastern reserve.

I suggest improving the core park with a simple parking structure --- that works --- as to access and egress, as presented by the architects. This would free the flow of people and liberate the core. Then, as a first priority, we must develop and finish the remaining east park reserve in a responsible manner, to a &quot;park-like&quot; park, as intended by our park’s founding fathers.

November 7, 1987, San Diego Union, B-1. Steve Schmidt: Cabrillo Bridge auto ban idea dies.

San Diego park officials have scrapped a proposal to ban vehicles from Balboa Park’s majestic Cabrillo Bridge following fierce opposition to the idea.

The city Park and Recreation Department is recommending instead that traffic along the two-lane bridge be reduced to a single one-way lane that would feed into the heart of the park.

November 9, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-7. EDITORIAL: Shaping Balboa Park’s Future.

. . . from the sometimes heated debate over how to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the core of the park came a compromise that we believe should benefit all park users.

It permits one-way traffic on Cabrillo Bridge, closes the parking lot in front of the Museum of Art and routes all traffic south at the House of Charm.

But if parking is to be eliminated on the Prado, it is imperative that replacement spaces by provided nearby.

The most logical is construction of a 300-space parking garage on the existing parking lot behind Alcazar Gardens.

November 9, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-7. Council decisions on park master plan are crucial, by Celia Ballesteros.

Balboa Park was donated to San Diegans 119 years ago and set apart as an island of beauty, tranquillity and entertainment --- an urban sanctuary.

Today, by the millions, we visit, run, walk, rest and play throughout its 1,400 acres [sic], enjoying its multiple attractions. We love the park. In fact, we are loving it to death.

Today, the San Diego City Council will make decisions on the park master plan that is designed to serve as the park’s planning document for the next 20 years. The preservation of this resource as a free, open park for the enjoyment of all San Diegans depends on the council’s approval of a plan which accommodates increased travel to and through the park, without turning &quot;paradise into a parking lot.&quot;

If the park is not to become one more pedestrian/vehicular traffic snarl, strangling movement, scenic open spaces and the many natural canyons in a cloud of noxious carbon monoxide, the issues of foot access, auto circulation and parking must be addressed.

With the November 3 failure of Propositions B and C to fund park transit improvements through general obligation bonds, it is critical that the city identify short- and long-term transportation alternatives from the standpoint of land use.

It is possible to strike a reasonable balance between maintaining a strong traffic circulation element while retaining the pedestrian ambiance, without robbing the park of its natural and exhaustible resources, such as Archery Canyon.

There are several amenable traffic and parking elements proposed in the plan which will limit the encroachment on public land yet encourage solutions to the problem of excessive traffic around the park.

The acute need for parking in the downtown and uptown areas is spilling over into the issue of Balboa Park. People traveling to these areas to work and shop are tying up parking space needed for park visitors.

For the last few months, a task force including representatives from San Diego City College has been working with the 8 th District office to seek solutions to these problems in the Balboa Park area and the consideration of a joint city/college sports complex. The task force has suggested two logical alternatives.

Either proposal supplies auto space in excess of the projected park requirements and presents an answer to downtown’s peripheral parking needs. A peripheral parking concept as a solution to downtown’s shortage of available parking space is supported by the Central City Association, San Diegans, Inc. and Ernest Hahn’s Center City Planning Committee.

The task force recommends a major three to four-story complex, capable of housing up to 2,800 vehicles, constructed at Inspiration Point on the former Naval Hospital complex. Primary access to the parking structure would be from Pershing Drive. The upper story would be at the Park Boulevard and President’s Way elevation, which could be reclaimed as an active grassy open space.

With proper construction and landscaping, this lot would be the least intrusive and would satisfy parking needs for the next 20 years.

The San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Architects has proposed an additional parking facility behind Spreckels Organ Pavilion as an answer to the intra-parking need, utilizing existing parking space. The proposed two-level subterranean parking, featuring 100-percent landscaping at street level, would hold up to 700 spaces.

Tuesday’s vote effectively killed funding for this facility, falling short of the required two-thirds vote. However, almost 60 percent of the voters recognized the need for park improvements. The City Council will have to find a positive response to that majority.

Also, the retention of the Alcazar Garden surface lot will assure a practical, convenient area of approximately 130 more spaces.

City College property along Highway 5, being used as surface parking, also has potential as a second alternative for a multi-story parking facility because of its slope.

The Cabrillo Bridge is the most attractive entrance into the park, and should remain open to a single lane of in-bound traffic. This one-lane would continue around the House of Charm (where a passenger drop-off point would be provided) and continue down the existing Pan-American road east and connect with President’s Way, which would remain a two-way street.

Through traffic could leave the park via Pershing Drive and Park Boulevard. The existing second traffic lane would be for use of bicyclists and the public shuttle or tram system for moving people within the park. Existing walkways would be maintained for pedestrians.

The most important component in the traffic-circulation proposal is the shift in focus from Laurel Street to Pershing Drive as the main access into the park --- maintaining Laurel Street as a viable entry, but concentrating on Pershing Drive with its superior freeway access.

Until a park shuttle system is in place, and people have become accustomed to it, no parking lots should be eliminated and no major road changes should be instituted.

One final element in the Balboa Park Master Plan is an appropriate location for a new municipal gymnasium. City College officials want to discuss the potential location of a new gym on city- and college-owned property south of Balboa Park across from Inspiration Point. This sports complex would include a new municipal gym, an Olympic quality swimming pool and the new refurbished Balboa Stadium. This would have the effect of adding land to a shrinking Balboa Park.

The park master plan represents a golden opportunity for the council to adopt a document that will provide comprehensive goals and objectives sensitive to San Diego’s love affair with Balboa Park. It will assure the preservation of the park’s amenities and natural beauty for generations to come and maintain its continued accessibility as an urban sanctuary.

November 10, 1987, Los Angeles Times, II, 1. Council Delays Decision to Keep Cabrillo Bridge Open, by Leonard Bernstein.

The City Council on Monday took its first small steps toward planning the future of Balboa Park but put off a decision on a recommendation to convert the Cabrillo Bridge entrance to a one-way eastbound street.

At the suggestion of Councilman Bill Cleator, the council deferred a decision on the controversial Cabrillo Bridge entrance to allow a consultant 120 days to study parking, access and circulation throughout the 1,100-acre park. The council also postponed decisions on proposed new parking structures until after the study is completed.

The council did agree to look for a new location for the municipal gym outside the park, to leave the Centro Cultural de la Raza at its current location in Pepper Grove and not to oust Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Camp Fire Girls from their facilities in the park’s northwest corner when their lease expires in 2005.

He said the city has allowed museums and other institutions and roads to disturb what was originally meant to be greenery.

And he noted that the park’s undeveloped east side is currently the site of a landfill, maintenance yard and a nursery.

November 17, 1987, San Diego Tribune, B-6. Letter, Jack R. Sanders, San Diego: Reject tax issues.

No sooner has the voters rejected new park taxes than Mayor O’Connor was on the stump for a new proposition.

This time, she wants a special taxing agency, so that the scheme will take only a bare majority vote.

Because only 37 percent of the voters went to the polls last time, a majority would have been 19 percent of the registered voters. This number in favor would pass the tax. In fact, two weeks ago, only 16.8 percent of eligible voters actually voted for Proposition A, but it passed.

A key protection of Proposition 13 was that most new taxes would require a two-third vote. Do we really want 19 percent of the electorate passing a new tax? These elections are too much influenced by special-interest groups, that vote heavily on issues that benefit them personally.

Let’s hope that this insight sinks in with the leaders at City Hall. Let’s keep the few taxpayer protections we have.

City officials are bailing out of the nativity scene business following concerns about a holiday exhibit on display in Balboa Park.

City Attorney John Witt said the city’s annual placement of the exhibit --- a classic Christian nativity scene --- appears to be illegal in light of recent court rulings.

The nativity scene as displayed would be viewed by the courts as a violation of the separation of church and state, Witt said yesterday.

He said his office recently decided to shelve the scene after the San Diego chapter of the United Jewish Federation questioned the exhibit’s legality.

The scene is making its final appearance this holiday season in the park’s Organ Pavilion.

Next year, officials plan to have a private organization erect a display with a range of holiday symbols such as a Jewish menorah, a Christmas tree and other general symbols.

&quot;The Santa Claus stuff,&quot; Witt called it.

He said a 1984 Supreme Court ruling based on similar circumstances said such an exhibit violated the time-honored division of church and state.

A subsequent ruling by a lower court broadened but essentially reaffirmed the 1984 Supreme Cour decision, he said.

Witt said the nativity exhibit has been maintained, stored and displayed by park employees at Balboa Park’s Organ Pavilion &quot;longer than anyone can remember.&quot;

Paul Downey, a spokesman for Mayor Maureen O’Connor, said the mayor wants a holiday exhibit maintained in the Organ Pavilion because of tradition and favors reworking the display to include a range of symbols.

&quot;As long as the city is not involved, we are legally OK,&quot; he said.

December 10, 1987, San Diego Union, B-12. EDITORIAL: Reclaiming the (Golden Hill) park.

On weekends, Golden Hill Park is a gathering place of drug dealers, junkies, gang members and other thugs who menace San Diego’s parks. But last Sunday was different in the park located at 25 th and A streets, because some of the good people of Golden Hill decided to reclaim the park.

At sunset, approximately 50 neighbors has a picnic in one corner of the park overlooking the city. Although a good time was enjoyed, the real purpose of the outing was to declare the park off-limits to criminals. Indeed the gathering had the desired effect as there was a noticeable decline in drug trafficking and the meanness that prevents many persons from venturing into the park even during daylight hours.

December 22, 1987, San Diego Union, B-1, B-1. Steve Schmidt: Atheists threaten to sue over crèche.

The San Diego chapter of American Atheists yesterday threatened to sue the city if it does not remove the controversial Nativity scene at Balboa Park by noon on Christmas eve.

Chapter director Stephen Thorne charged that the annual placement of the scene on city property violates the U.S. Constitution’s separation of church and state.

&quot;You have compromised the Constitution of our nation,&quot; Thorne wrote in a letter he plans to submit to the city today.

City Attorney John Witt said last night he does not believe the city will respond to Thorne’s threat --- or the looming deadline attached to it. &quot;As far as I’m concerned, we’re not going to react,&quot; he said.

He reiterated his most recent finding that the scene is legal as long as the city plays no direct role in storing and maintaining it as it has in the past.

Following questions about the legality of the crèche scene, city officials recently agreed to turn over responsibility for it to the Community Christmas Center Committee. The private groups plan to expand it next year to include a variety of holiday symbols --- both secular and religious.
