 Eat portions the size of a small fist. Watch out for inflation. Snack before dinner. Split the entree. Think small. Don&apos;t serve from the table. Beware of eating in front of the TV.

 Are you eating more than you think you&apos;re eating? 

Thanks to inflated portion sizes, you probably are. It&apos;s all too easy to lose 
track of normal portion sizes when you&apos;re dining off of giant plates while 
chatting with family and friends. You just eat whatever is put in front of you, 
and only notice the effects later when your pants stoutly refuse to button.

&quot;Portion distortion is a problem,&quot; says nutritionist Elaine Magee, MPH, RD, 
the &quot;Recipe Doctor&quot; at the WebMD Weight Loss Clinic. &quot;It&apos;s one piece of the obesity problem in the U.S.&quot;

Despite all of the publicity -- one fast-food restaurant is even phasing out 
supersized meals -- these days, most of us would hardly recognize a normal 
portion. So often we split a pint of ice cream three ways and congratulate 
ourselves because we didn&apos;t eat the whole thing!

Unless we want to lug a kitchen scale around, we need to learn how to size up 
our meals no matter where we are. Here are Magee&apos;s top seven tips for keeping 
portions healthy and sensible.

 Eat portions the size of a small fist. 

The best way to figure out how much you&apos;re eating is to measure it. But since 
you may not always have the necessary equipment on you, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture helpfully estimates portion size relative to common objects.

1/2 a cup of fruit, vegetables, pasta or rice = a small fist 3 ounces of 
cooked meat, poultry or fish = a deck of cards 1 tortilla = a small salad plate 
1 medium bagel = a hockey puck 1 muffin = a large egg 1 baked potato = a 
computer mouse 1.5 ounces of cheese = 6 dice 1 teaspoon of margarine or butter = 
a thumb tip 2 tbsp. Peanut butter = a golf ball

 Watch out for inflation. 

The size of common foods like bagels and muffins has grown freakishly large 
in recent years. Your grandmother ate a three-inch bagel with 150 calories. 
Today, most bagels average four to five inches across and pack 300 to 400 
calories. Never assume that a bagel is just a bagel or a soda is just a soda -- 
it could have twice as many the calories as you expect.

Also, remember that the plates in many restaurants are big and may give you a 
false sense of the amount you&apos;re eating. A normal-sized home-cooked dinner would 
look tiny and pitiful on the gargantuan plates used at many restaurants.

 Snack before dinner. 

If you&apos;re starving when you sit down at a restaurant, you&apos;re more likely to 
order more than you need. Will you really need that entree and that soup and 
that appetizer, or are you just so hungry now that you think you will?

Eat a snack of fruit or vegetables an hour or two you go out to eat. Spoil 
your dinner a little -- just enough to take the edge off your hunger so that you 
order sensibly.

 Split the entree.
