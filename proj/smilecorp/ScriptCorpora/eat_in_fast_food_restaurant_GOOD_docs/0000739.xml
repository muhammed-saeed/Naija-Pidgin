 I use to come very often in this place and the food use to be very good but I&apos;m sorry on my last few visits I was very disappointed, the food was very bad I really don&apos;t understand why, it was not busy.

I think this got something to do with the kitchen organization.

 having not eaten out in crouch end for some time i thought i would treat my 8 year old who wanted to go to Banners. Banners was full and busy unsurprisingly as the food and service is great. Off we went to Monkey Nuts, we walked in at 2.30pm the lunch time spill had filtered out...i asked for a table for three as my husband was going to join us..have you booked..no i have not i replied was i supposed to ..the restaurant was busy but there was an obvious number of empty tables..well yes you have to book...said the man..my daughter hungry and slightly embarassed thinking we were not going to be seated..do you have a table or dont you i asked....well yes we do...(i was thinking why didnt you just show us to it instead of creating a fuss) I wanted to leave but my daughter had her heart set on staying. anyway,,one moment the man said he went to the back of the restaurant and led us through to the smallest table for 3 which would have comfortably seated one. an insult. especially when there were 3 tables for 4 empty. the table was sticky and not cleaned. the food arrived i ordered fajitas which tasted like it was cooked with tomato ketchup that had been burned. my daughters burger seemed ok as she ate it (but by this time she was hungry) the intro service just put me right off the snobbery of having to book in a fast food restaurant . that said the girl serving us was very good i told her i would not be paying the so called optional service charge to take it off the bill...but i gave her a tip for her. management need to manage the place is a fast food joint not Scotts... get off that high horse Monkey Nuts you aint that great i have cooked much better fajitas yours were a load of rubbish.

 The awful experience of yesterdays monkey nuts brunch with friends and their children has meant we will never be spending money in there again! I&apos;ve had a similarly bad experience in the past but thought I would give it another try but wish I hadn&apos;t bothered!

The weekend manager made us feel so unwelcome from the moment we arrived, (on time and with well behaved children I might add). We wanted to order the children their dinners first and then think about ours but that was apparently to much to ask for. Now I would understand if we had descended on an adults only restaurant with our children and expected them to accomodate us but monkey nuts has a huge amount of high chairs, a childrens menu and crayons and often resembles a nursery instead of a restaurant so I would have thought the manager would be accomodating to the majority of the clientele on a Saturday lunchtime - families. Instead he made several comments about us and our children to staff within earshot and made it extremely clear he did not want us there. I would be more understanding if our children had been little horrors but in fact they were very well behaved!

I think the manager may have chosen the wrong job as he definately needs to improve his cutomer service skills.

Along with his appalling attitude the food was average and the whole experience was awful. Wouldn&apos;t recommend to anyone.

 I recently went to Monkey Nuts in Crouch End with a group of friends and had a great night! The food was delicious and the service was top notch. We felt welcomed and taken care of from the moment we walked in the door. The atmosphere was in the restaurant was great as well.

Thanks for the being a part of a great night out!

 I like food, which is why it is such a huge mistake eating in Monkeynuts. I don&apos;t eat meat very often, and am very particular about where and what meat I eat. I would NOT eat meat in Monkeynuts, which leaves precious little on the utterly rubbish menu. There are meat free meals, but they are all so ...... rubbish. For some reason they have never seen fit to put a proper vege burger on their menu, chosing instead to sell vegetarian &apos;burgers&apos; which consist of a slice of halloumi and a slice of beetroot and a lump of hummous, or the more recent offering, a lump of deep fried goats cheese and a slice of red pepper. THIS IS NOT A BURGER! This is a sandwich, and a rubbish one at that.

I have to say that my children love it, but they don&apos;t mind rubbish food, on the contrary, the more rubbish the better. I have been dragged in to Monkeynuts more times than I care to remember and have NEVER had a decent meal. My husband, who is far easier to please than me says exactly the same. This evening, which is the last time I shall ever go to Monkeynuts, I ordered a cranberry presse, which tasted of flat lemonade, a portion of chips which had that slightly cheesy rancid taste to them,, and a small house salad which was so so soooooooooooo dull and pathetic I just couldn&apos;t be bothered to eat it.

If anyone ever ever sees me go anywhere near this place again, please shoot me or something. RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH!

The staff are quite nice on the other hand.

 After reading the poor reviews we thought give it a try,i wish we did not.

Service ok,not brill,was&apos;nt sure who was our waitress.

The bill was a shocker £87 for 3 adults and one child, what a rip off.

Go to TGI&apos;Fridays,half the price and the grub is up to scratch.

 Extremely disappointing. Probably the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Rude staff making faces at customers. When I made a complaint the manager didn&apos;t even pretend to listen to me, just told me that she doesn&apos;t believe what I&apos;m saying about her staff. Avoid it all cost, unless if you like being treated like a doormat.

 I am a massive foody and restaurant lover who has recently been livivng on my friends sofa in North London.... as a repayment for his kind hospitality, I have been repaying him in Burgers from his favourite restaurant ( good job they do a favourable economical burger deal, hence the reason we only go there from 5pm until 7pm!!!!!!)..... Well, what an amazing way to pay rent, burgers are tasty... chicken nacho the best.......nachos in a burger, genius!!!!! A further stroke of genius are the half price cocktails, dont think it matters what time of the year it is, I can always manage to quaff a few margaritas, especilly when they are properly made.....

Yes, I love my food and drink but it would be most unfair to mention the staff, who, after only a few weeks, I have built up a great rapport with.... ( maybe due to my margarita tongue!!!!!) .. No, in all honesty the staff are down to earth, friendly and accommodating and all in all round the place off very nicely....... Good work Monkeynuts and all who work there, I will now be looking for my own flat to live in in North London!!!!!!!

 This place seems to be a regular haunt for the cast of Eastenders. Its a must for those of you who enjoy spotting celebs. I was in there last week having a beer when Liam Gallagher (from Oasis) sauntered in... seems like a very popular place with, great music.
