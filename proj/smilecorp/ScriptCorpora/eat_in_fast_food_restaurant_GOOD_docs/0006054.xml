About Fast Food 
 
&apos;&apos;Fast food&apos;&apos; has become a regular part of people&apos;s vocabulary since the 1950&apos;s. The convenient, fast, and relatively cheap prices of fast food restaurants have made them some of the most popular stops for people on the move. Offering typical American foods like burgers, fries, and soft drinks, fast food restaurants have a definite American vibe and foothold.
