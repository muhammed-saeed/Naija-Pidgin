  Besta One Italian Grille is the best restaurant in the area. I have tried most of the restaurants and none compare with their food, service, cleanliness and prices. We visit 2 a month and have tried most of their menu, I have not found any dishes that I was not pleased with, from appetizers to desserts, they are the best!!!! A diner

  Just a note to let you know how impressed we were with Besta One this weekend. My husband and I enjoyed the wonderful atmosphere, the music and dinner. We enjoyed a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon with the Besta One Italian Feast Platter for Two. Our server was polite and attentive, our meal was done to perfection and the price was very reasonable. Keep up the good work!

  THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT ANYWHERE IN TOWN, FLAT OUT, HANDS DOWN. THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC ITALIAN. JUST LIKE DINING OUT IN MANHATTAN. HAVEN&apos;T HAD BETTER SINCE WE LEFT 25 YEARS AGO. THE ATMOSPHERE IS FUN&amp;UPBEAT&amp;THE SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH. THIS IS A QUALITY DINING EXPERIENCE ALL AROUND. THE WEEKEND SPECIALS ARE ELEGANT&amp;SUPURB IN QUALITY&amp;PRESENTATION. BIG MENU, PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM. ALSO THE BEST PIZZA I&apos;VE EVER HAD, BY THE WAY. MY GRANDKIDS LOVE THE PIZZA MAN THAT THROWS THE PIZZA IN THE AIR&amp;SINGS WHILE HE DOES IT. WE ALWAYS TAKE VISITORS HERE WHENEVER THEY COME. IT&apos;S MY MOTHER-IN-LAW&apos;S FAVORITE NIGHT OUT WHENEVER SHE VISITS. NICE WINE LIST, LINEN NAPKINS, WARM, INVITING, CLEAN, CONTEMPORARY, COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE. ELEGANT&amp;CASUAL, ALL AT THE SAME TIME. GREAT MUSIC,TOO! YOU WON&apos;T FIND ANYWHERE BETTER TO TREAT YOURSELF TO A NICE NIGHT OUT. WAITSTAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY&amp;KNOWLEDGABLE&amp;OWNERS ARE GREAT FUN, TOO. WE ALWAYS SEE PEOPLE WE KNOW WHEN WE GET THERE&amp;WIND UP SHARING DRINKS. NOT THE CHEAPEST IN TOWN, BUT BY FAR THE BEST&amp;WORTH EVERY PENNY. DEFINATELY OUR FAVORITE SPOT.
