 Bright Trading&apos;s new payout model 

I&apos;m curious why Don has not commented yet on Bright Trading moving to an 80% payout model. Not by his choice, but Goldman&apos;s.

I&apos;m not involved with the management side of the industry so this is pure speculation, but bets are these will be common models due the regulatory pressure Robert Green has been hinting at.

Well, if that&apos;s true it will wipe out 90% of the prop firms especially those that clear Goldman. Why give 20% of your profits to Bright when you put up your own capital when you can get full backing and give up 25% to 50% of your profits. I&apos;m guessing Don is going to seriously consider moving his clearing to Merrill.

Bright Trading is going to have to give up the 100% payout model. All firms clearing Goldman have to. At most they can give the trader 80% of their profits.

It&apos;s not bull. We clear GS in one of our JBO&apos;s. It&apos;s happening.

Maverick, is there any benefit to the trader to give away 20% of their payout, such as reduced commissions? Better service? ??

Or, is this a move toward making GS uncompetitive?

Thank you,

Thank you, 

I honestly think it&apos;s two things. One, GS is not interested in clearing the mom and pop type prop firms anymore. And two, GS is probably under a lot of pressure to streamline their business due to concerns over regulatory scrutiny.

GS clearing fees are already sky high and GS is not going to get the 20%, Bright will. So GS will not offer anything better then what they are already offering now. Now, will Bright lower their fees? Well, they will be under intense pressure to do that. However that is something they certainly do not want to do. Most these prop traders are not making money, so Don stands little to gain by getting their p&amp;l;and then having to give up the sure money he gets from commissions.

so where did the 80% figure come from, why not 90, 95 or 98?

Does it matter? GS determined the number. How does GS determine how much they want to ass rape their clients on OTC transactions? Maybe they just pull the number out of a hat every time a client calls for a quote on a 5 year 6% floating rate Brazilian bond denominated in Euros that converts into a MBS when long term rates hit 7% or when it starts raining in Chile whichever comes first.

I doubt it. There are huge differences between all the clearing firms. They all have their own specialties. GS has always been tight. In their defense, they have by far the best global operation and are the most capitalized.

So if there is no difference going forward as far as payout for all clearing firms, and 80% payout is common then futures trading and possibly forex is a better option? What are you looking at Maverick? Are you giving up on prop trading, or just going to take a hit as all clearing firms are going the same way?

Why would anyone stay if they now have to give up 20%? Won&apos;t everybody just go somewhere they can keep 100%?

He said it goes to Bright. So this entire argument doesnt make any sense or is flawed. If the 20% goes to Bright, then wouldn&apos;t Bright simply pass it on to the traders? What is Goldman going to tell Bright, &quot;no, you have to keep the money for yourselves! It&apos;s the only way we will do business with you!&quot; There&apos;s got to be more to the story. Don needs to come on here and clarify.

Guys look, there is no controversy here. Don has already PMed me. I know what the deal is. The fact of the matter is, Don got away with this for years. Our firm never did 100% payouts specifically for this reason. We did it because under the eyes of the SEC it looks like your class b partners are customers and you can&apos;t have customers in a JBO.

The 20% goes to Bright and no he can&apos;t give it back to you. What would be the point to that? GS has defined what a professional relationship is in their JBO and it&apos;s 80/20. They could have said 50/50. No one has to be a member of their JBO. They are not holding a gun to Don&apos;s head.

But just to clarify, Don did send me a PM about this a week or so ago when I brought it to his attention. He confirmed it. End of story.

So what is the purpose of joining a prop firm?

I get 100% Payouts with etrade pro minus the little commission which is nothing really.

Vs giving some firm 20% of my earnings.

I see no purpose for joining a prop firm.

There are many advantages but not really for the pure daytrader. If you hold overnights and daytrade then the advantages are huge.

Example: Say you have 50k and your option positions on that tie up 40k. Then you want to put on some long/short equity positions but now you have no capital left for that. Now you say you want to daytrade. Well, no capital for all that either. The issue is in a Reg T environment your hands are tied because your capital gets locked up in margin.

Again if you are simply daytrading, the advantages to going prop today are not what they use to be. But to the guy that wants to be more diverse in his trading and do many different things, then there are huge advantages to going prop.

(Back from my 2 week vacation/cruise to Amsterdam, Russia, Germany, Finland, Sweden etc. - whew, talk about exhausting, but fun).

I can&apos;t say too much at this point, but the basic premise is that there is extreme pressure (so much that some &quot;competitors&quot; chose to just stop accepting new traders) to assure that we (and the other major GS firms) are &quot;true prop&quot; in that they don&apos;t have 100% payout traders).

 Reference: FINRA 10-18 - as previously discussed 

Our Accountant in Chicago who handles dozens of trading firms informs us that many are already changing policies too.

Knowing that this was coming, we set up our JVC program where traders can qualify for a second account, no downside risk, and keep at least 50% of the profits. Read previous posts or feel free to call me discuss this.

Our current traders have been advised of this upcoming event, and we suggested that those with adequate capital, take a $million or so and use IB for certain trades, keep a smaller amount to use the leverage here. We will help them with this.

We are extremely comfortable that with the other major benefits we offer that most firms don&apos;t, and that the other major firms have already adopted this, that overall this will not have a big effect for most traders.

It has been my understanding that a prop trader cannot have an account somewhere else without their sponsor&apos;s (i.e. Bright&apos;s) permission. That is one of the considerations that lead me to rule out trading prop. I have been trading at IB for years, and all my software was written for their API.

I&apos;m sure most, if not all of our traders have retail accounts (I know I do, LOL). Simply a disclosure issue to prevent any nefarious activity. .

Yeah, we&apos;ve had a lot of money with Merrill for 20 years, and they have been &quot;courting&quot; us for a long time - but (dare I say it) - when we addressed this, they were very evasive about the question since they are &quot;BofA, Merrill&quot; and have other issues.

Once again, if it boils down to something as simple as joining CBSX or using Merrill to level the playing field at some point, so be it.

How is Vtrader dealing with this? Are you guys self clearing (I forgot, sorry).

Don, as I&apos;ve told you in private and on ET, we have never been a 100% payout firm. We never had members that acted as customers. For the life of me I don&apos;t know how you guys got away with it for so long. Even Robert Green wrote about this like 3 years ago that he didn&apos;t understand how some firms could get around this rule.

No, we are not self clearing. We clear Goldman, Merrill and Penson. I hope you enjoyed your cruise. I bet that inbox got pretty full while you were out. Sorry.

Loooong cruise, kinda cool...don&apos;t need to see any more churches or museums for quite some time. I have a call into our &quot;guy&quot; at Merrill - Unless you want to PM me your contact as well....

Okay so its really about Margin/leverage. I do not use either, I have enough capital/securities that I do not need to do that. I mainly do options (Short options) both puts and calls.

I do not daytrade. Although I might modify/adjust positions.

The nice thing about not using margin and leverage is not worrying about margin risk during swings in the markets or interest payments.

I can wait out some of the stormy periods. 
 Posted by CQNC on 07-30-10 09:20 PM: 
 

so in your opinions, would going with your own CBSX firm, clearing through GS would be the smartest route at the moment, given the change in the weather?

and what would the minimum capitalisation be preferable to be considered a &quot;reputable&quot; firm?

 Quote from 1outernational: 
 Why would you use your own capital when you can use someone elses. . . 
Losses in the prop firm&apos;s capital are guaranteed by the trader&apos;s capital contribution, so the only way the firm can lose money is if they fail to adequately supervise their traders. The issue being discussed in this thread is whether a 100% payout makes it look like a retail account. I believe that the requirement for a capital contribution also makes it look like a retail account.

Leverage seems to be the big attraction for prop, but there are other advantages (e.g. training and the camaraderie of a trading room).

If a trader has outside accounts, he needs to have those statements automatically sent to his sponsored firm.
Now, most guys with 20K at one of these prop firms are not going to be able to manipulate any markets with this amt., so it&apos;s kind of crazy that this is a requirement. Maybe if you have 100K or up but not 20K or less.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 Yeah, we&apos;ve had a lot of money with Merrill for 20 years, and they have been &quot;courting&quot; us for a long time - but (dare I say it) - when we addressed this, they were very evasive about the question since they are &quot;BofA, Merrill&quot; and have other issues.

Once again, if it boils down to something as simple as joining CBSX or using Merrill to level the playing field at some point, so be it.

How is Vtrader dealing with this? Are you guys self clearing (I forgot, sorry).

Don 

Don, with so many pair traders at your firm and all the overnight paired postions you guys carry, what clearing firms would you consider? since several clearing firms do not offer the overnight leverage GSEC and Merrill can offer.

 Quote from CQNC: 

 so in your opinions, would going with your own CBSX firm, clearing through GS would be the smartest route at the moment, given the change in the weather?

and what would the minimum capitalisation be preferable to be considered a &quot;reputable&quot; firm? 

Jury is still out on your first note, and we are accepting younger traders who qualify with as little as $10K.

Actually the concern is form the other direction...the so called &quot;Trust Fund Baby&quot; potential. If you grandparents left you $5million, but only a small allowance could be taken, but they let you handle the stock positions...one &quot;could&quot; trade obscure stocks and move them to a prop account for cash.

We rarely need use the Clearing firm&apos;s &quot;leverage&quot; - we stay pretty much even.

We need good back office and short stock lists primarily. We have tried other Firm&apos;s - but never left SLK/GS - but, as I said previously, we are always exploring our options.

Don 

Actually that is not the concern. Don you should walk over to your compliance dept and get to know them a little better. LOL. The issue is AML policy which I know your firm must enforce strictly as we do as well.

The issue is with having the ability to launder money from one account to another or possibly even launder the money out of the country without a trace. In fact there was recently a case where exactly this was done through two FCM&apos;s where over 7 figures was transferred from an account in the US to Russia.

What&apos;s the big deal, so then traders move to another firm offering 100%.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 I honestly think it&apos;s two things. One, GS is not interested in clearing the mom and pop type prop firms anymore. And two, GS is probably under a lot of pressure to streamline their business due to concerns over regulatory scrutiny.

GS clearing fees are already sky high and GS is not going to get the 20%, Bright will. So GS will not offer anything better then what they are already offering now. Now, will Bright lower their fees? Well, they will be under intense pressure to do that. However that is something they certainly do not want to do. Most these prop traders are not making money, so Don stands little to gain by getting their p&amp;l;and then having to give up the sure money he gets from commissions.

 Quote from Lights:

Well, the 100% days are over. But there certainly are no shortage of firms that offer much higher payouts then 80%. The problem Don is going to have is that there actually are a lot of firms that offer 60% to 80% payouts where the traders use firm capital. Margins are getting squeezed everywhere.

I honestly think equity prop firms will be non existent in the next few years. At some point the risk to reward for stock starts to get really ugly. Back in the Worldco days the margins were sick, I mean sick. That world is gone. Now I see both firms and traders alike having to take more and more risk to make less and less money. The math simply doesn&apos;t add up. Of course this can be said of our entire financial system in general.

Right now in my opinion, I think equity prop firms are the equivalent of an option seller. Basically selling .10 options and praying the music doesn&apos;t stop.

Yes my friend, you are right...the money laundering historically was done for the reasons I noted long before we were concerned about &quot;drug money&quot; or other bad guys. But, yes, we had to appoint a AML &quot;czar&quot; as well, LOL.

Might be time to have another audio discussion with you about the things that are working in today&apos;s environment...help people out a bit...I am extremely motivated after our weekend long Intensive workshop over the last couple of days. We addressed everything, and had our top people (some who had fewer than 7 losing days this year, even I was a bit shocked).

With all the pessimism out there (much of it rightfully so), it was nice to hear the good stuff.....and, as always, I&apos;m sure your top guys are doing well with the derivatives.

Just educational...I think we were well received last time we had an online event....whaddya think?

(I guess I could just call you, LOL).

Don 

Sure we could do that again.

The point I am trying to make Don is not that there is no one making money. I&apos;m talking about this from the prop firm&apos;s prospective. Look, that guy you talk about who had fewer then 7 losing days in the last year, what do you make on that guy? You are not getting his p&amp;l;right? No, you are getting his commissions. That guy could have only had 7 winning days last year and you as a firm could have theoretically made the same amount on him in commissions.

The problem Don is that there are not enough of those guys to offset the dead weight. The reason I used the option seller analogy is precisely because of that guy you just mentioned. Firms have to lean really hard on those exceptional traders. Not just Bright Trading but every prop firm all the way up to the Goldman&apos;s and JPM&apos;s of the world. You don&apos;t own those assets. Those assets have flight risk. A majority of your traders produce less then 10% of your firm&apos;s revenue. The top 10% make or break your firm. This is not just true of Bright Trading but every trading firm in the world.

So in order for your firm to stay solvent, you have to keep those guys and subsidize the bad guys. But as you are doing this your margins keep getting tighter and tighter and the risk keeps getting higher and higher. Just like our banking system, it&apos;s a tight rope. At some point the music stops playing.

BTW, these issues I am bringing up I&apos;m not trying to throw them all in your direction, these are problems the entire industry is facing. Look, you guys never use to look at guys with less then 25k in capital. Then that dropped to 20k. Now I see you will look at guys with 10k. When does it go to 5k? Or 1k? You should not have to do that. In fact, you should be going the other way. Our firm has been raising capital requirements every year, not lowering them. This is usually the sign that an industry is in it&apos;s final stages where you basically open the doors and take anyone.

Again, I&apos;m not trying to insinuate that Bright Trading is going to go under. Bob is a smart guy. Don, not as much (just kidding). You guys do have a valuable asset and that is capital and I&apos;m sure Bright 2.0 is around the corner. You&apos;ll find a way to evolve, you have the money to do it. But Bright Trading as it exists in its current form as well as most day trading stock firms, will probably not exist in 2 years. Just one man&apos;s opinion. I am often wrong.

I still don&apos;t understand this or Don&apos;s statement. It&apos;s my understanding that the requirement to disclose applies only to licensees. I have no trading-related licenses -- don&apos;t need any -- and so far as I know, I can have accounts scattered all about with no disclosure. Am I wrong about that?

Exactly. When you trade a firm account, the account is not in &quot;your&quot; name. Very easy to launder money. If I have an IB account in &quot;my&quot; name and launder the money to my TOS account in &quot;my&quot; name, well, that&apos;s a pretty easy paper trail even for our incompetent SEC to follow.

Actually, our commission revenue is down considerably, and doesn&apos;t even concern us that much overal - our net pricing is down 40%, obviously GS has not come down. As you mention, the use of capital, although cheap at 3% per year (for our JVC, and average for normal accounts) is &quot;making&quot; more money than commissions.

Goldman&apos;s and JPM&apos;s of the world. You don&apos;t own those assets. Those assets have flight risk. 
What we discussed with our people over the weekend - those who keep a few $million in their Bright accounts, is to take most the money to IB or MBT or somewhere for a good portion of their trading....and just keep $250K or so with us for their leveraged out pairs, mergers etc.

FWIW, Aug 1 was the deadline for signing the new &quot;deal&quot; (contract), and we had only 2 resign noting the &quot;deal&quot; had changed. And, to be honest, I don&apos;t think that was the real reason.

To be fair, we have always entertained, and brought on recent college grades, with high skill levels in computers and programming with about $10K - it&apos;s just the old geezers (ovefr 40, LOL - not that we age discrminiate, that we worry about, LOL).

 You&apos;ll find a way to evolve, you have the money to do it. But Bright Trading as it exists in its current form as well as most day trading stock firms, will probably not exist in 2 years. Just one man&apos;s opinion. I am often wrong. 

Yep, you hit the nail on the head...adapting is the key to success, and boy have we gone through some changes over the years. One thing remains fundamental...traders have to make money, regardless of &quot;splits&quot; or costs or anything else...if they don&apos;t, the go away...we&apos;re pretty proud of our traders ability to adapt along with us.

Don, if I owned stock in Bright Trading I would be selling it short with impugnity if I heard you say that at a board meeting. You have to care about commision revenue. If you are making all your money on just the rake you charge guys for lending capital then I change my mind on what I said about Bright 2.0. LOL.

 What we discussed with our people over the weekend - those who keep a few $million in their Bright accounts, is to take most the money to IB or MBT or somewhere for a good portion of their trading....and just keep $250K or so with us for their leveraged out pairs, mergers etc.

Again Don, if I were long your stock and I heard you telling your traders that the best place for their capital is &quot;NOT&quot; at Bright Trading, I couldn&apos;t hit the sell short button fast enough.


 To be fair, we have always entertained, and brought on recent college grades, with high skill levels in computers and programming with about $10K - it&apos;s just the old geezers (ovefr 40, LOL - not that we age discrminiate, that we worry about, LOL). 

That is not my understanding. Don I have sent many many traders to you when we could not service the business who did not have 25k and you turned them away in spades. This is a very new development to hear that you always took these guys on. In fact you and I have had meetings in person where we both agreed that it was silly to take guys in with such little capital. In fact you and I both laughed at the funny 5k down and pull the lever prop firms out there.


 Yep, you hit the nail on the head...adapting is the key to success, and boy have we gone through some changes over the years. One thing remains fundamental...traders have to make money, regardless of &quot;splits&quot; or costs or anything else...if they don&apos;t, the go away...we&apos;re pretty proud of our traders ability to adapt along with us. 

How are you adapting? Are you moving into futures? Options? OTC? I believe your bread and butter is still the same as it was 10 years ago, pair trading. Only 10 years ago guys were trading 10 times bigger and you had 10 times the profit margins. The only change I see is your margins getting crushed and your risk going higher. Don, you know I am straight shooter that is how I know you are not taking offense to this. There is nothing wrong with telling the truth and admitting this industry, at least how it pertains to stock, is dying. It may not be fair, it may not be just, but it is happening. Just as the floor model died, so too is this. I don&apos;t like it anymore then you do. I don&apos;t mind playing good cop/bad cop with you, but I think we need to be honest with the trading community. I&apos;ve always thought you ran a good honest business and I still believe that to be the case even though we obviously disagree on the state of the business and this silly thing called pair trading (kidding again Don). I think I have a better pulse on things out here in Chicago as I hear how a lot of the prop firms are doing. Both stock, options, futures and everything in the middle. It&apos;s pretty grim Don. God knows what will happen if the government takes the leverage away. Where would this country be if we could not leverage everything in sight 100 to 1? A banana republic?

I&apos;ll have to agree with Don here. Firms that evolve with the changing regulations and adjust to those new markets survive. It&apos;s always been survival of the fittest and always will be.

Having said that, I will agree with Maverick in that firms that do not risk capital and share risk with traders probably won&apos;t be around much longer. Those that do seem to be doing just fine these past 3 years.

Short our stock? It&apos;s you naked short sellers that have runied the industry, LOL.....

Sure, overall profits are down, but with so many firms just &quot;going away&quot; I don&apos;t worry much.....and FWIW, the family trading, Bob primarily, and the other 5 of us, has more than compensated for it the last couple of years.

Our biggest &quot;adapting&quot; is the zero risk JVC program with nearly 175 traders in it right now. All with &quot;normal&quot; accounts and this second account with no downside and a 50% upside with automated programs that run on the same computer without interfering with their &quot;normal&quot; trading. So, each trader has multiple revenuje streams with the same initial deposit.

We have always been able to disagree respectuflly...as we do with off-floor futures trading for &quot;newer&quot; people off the CME floor. Similar points with options...the floor guys aren&apos;t writing any checks to upstairs traders IMO. I think there is a more level playing field with equities, especially cost wise. My brother pays a small &quot;cap&quot; for his emini&apos;s, I pay (don&apos;t laugh) $4.00 round trip...hard to compete. (Although I still make some money with the e&apos;s).

We are working harder than ever to help make the traders profitable. Going forward, if someone is losing consitently, he will cease to be a Bright Trader - we are insisting on them putting in the effort needed - much like the &quot;trup prop&quot; that seems to be where we are all heading.

At this point we don&apos;t want to resemble a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for all products and certainly don&apos;t want to keep a bunchof non-performing traders on the books....that would be un-wise in upcoming years.

Don

Edit: Did you say &quot;OTC&quot; above? We&apos;ve always traded Nasdaq stocks...that &quot;label&quot; was min-interpreted a decade ago simply because OTC stocks didn&apos;t have Opening Only orders, LOL. We have always traded the Naz, just differently....and, yes, of course in pairs as well as individual.

 Don. You are making this too easy. You keep throwing me these softballs. You are making my points for me. When you say that the &quot;family fund&quot; and &quot;bob&quot; are primarily supporting your firm, this is good how? That is my number one talking point. Your business model is not working, but bob is swinging around 500 e-minis at a clip or averaging down to zero in Providian stock with the &quot;family fund&quot; and you guys are staying afloat. You want your firm to stay afloat not because Bob has the balls of a russian race horse, but because the model you are running is robust. I know Bob is a good trader. I don&apos;t doubt that for a second. And I&apos;m really happy to hear the &quot;family fund&quot; is doing well, I really am, but all my comments are really geared towards the stock industry in general and the commission model in particular. 

Our biggest &quot;adapting&quot; is the zero risk JVC program with nearly 175 traders in it right now. All with &quot;normal&quot; accounts and this second account with no downside and a 50% upside with automated programs that run on the same computer without interfering with their &quot;normal&quot; trading. So, each trader has multiple revenuje streams with the same initial deposit.

 I actually like that idea. Not that I think any of those guys will make any real money on it, because I don&apos;t, but from a firm&apos;s perspective, it will generate relatively low risk commissions for you. But honestly, I do hope that works out for you. You guys are doing something new with that and please don&apos;t be offended by my cynicism.

 Don you guys have been around a long time and that means a lot. You guys are also well capitalized. Those are two great assets to have. Don&apos;t sqaunder that. You&apos;ve been on a cruise for 2 weeks so I&apos;m just helping you come back to reality. Consider it a little welcome back present. I hope your health is doing well. That&apos;s much more important then commissions.

Wow, I&apos;m in the process of joining Bright as we speak. I&apos;m signed up for the Sept class and just got my registration packet friday--currently studying for the Series 7.

Needless to say, I&apos;m a bit dismayed to have found this out on an online forum.

Now I&apos;m not sure what to do.

On the one hand, the JVC program, I guess, is intended to somewhat make up for this. But my understanding of it is that it is restricted to &quot;approved&quot; pairs trading activities.

This makes me think about poker, for example. Even a good poker player, if faced with a 20% rake, would have a hard time making any money. To extend the analogy, though, such a player might have a backing deal to get the ball rolling, but I don&apos;t know. 80% at 40/80 is better than 100% at 2/4.

The problem here is that you have all of the risk, but less profits. In the Tharp lingo, your &quot;R&quot; multiple will come down for whatever strategy you&apos;re using.

I&apos;m very much on the fence. I feel that going with this now will be essentially rolling the dice, staying retail will be safe, but with less upside potential.

I&apos;d love to hear some other thoughts...

We lowered our rates in anticipation of all this. Max is now .005 for a 200k month trader...shares above 1,000 are .003. Goes down as volume goes up of course.

And, as mentioned before...you can qualify (150 or so have already) for a second account, zero money up, automated program and keep 50% of the profits as well. The way I look at this second account is like sitting at a black jack table and guy sitting next to you says &quot;hey, do you mind if I give you half my profits, no downside? &quot; LOL. Hmm? Not too bad IMO.

The other major GS firms already doing this,.

So let me do some simple math here.

A trader that does one million shares a month and let&apos;s say makes 500k net a year.

This trader is going to save 12k in commissions but lose 100k in profits?

Quote from Don Bright:

Actually, our commission revenue is down considerably, and doesn&apos;t even concern us that much overal - our net pricing is down 40%, obviously GS has not come down. As you mention, the use of capital, although cheap at 3% per year (for our JVC, and average for normal accounts) is &quot;making&quot; more money than commissions. As you noted, our firm&apos;s &quot;edge&quot; for traders is capital usage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally we get the admission why Bright has been pushing overnight equity pairs so hard the last few years - they aren&apos;t in the commission business anymore, they are in the loaning money for overnights business.

Capital is &quot;cheap&quot; at 3% per year, LOL. Do the math - Bright puts up $1, GS gives them $6.66 in leverage which Bright loans to traders at only 3% for a nice return of .03x6.66=20% a year on the initial Bright capital. Pretty expensive small business loan - Bright traders treat it like a business, right? Not a bad allocation of capital when you are keeping commissions and a 50% split on the profits too.

Maverick 74, are you an owner of a prop shop as well? I am stock trader myself (for the last 12yrs) and have been thinking for a while to start a new futures program within my trading plan. As I read what you have to say about the future of stock trading via a prop firm (which I have always used), I will like to know your insights.

Total b.s.

I know many &quot;smart traders&quot; who netted millions over the last few years and rarely had a down month. EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING NOW!

Maverick is telling it like it is. Stop sugarcoating everything with your usual &quot;Bright rhetoric&quot;

HFT algo&apos;s from Goldman, Getco, Tradebot, HRT, etc. have destroyed nearly every single edge and the collapse in volume has made it even worse. More than half the market volume is the huge HFT boxes flipping the same shares back and forth for rebates.

For once just stop with the company lines and tell the truth. Your guys are struggling too and many are only a few more months (at most) from dropping out of the industry like so many have over the last year.

Unless something is done to stop HFT frontrunning, the &quot;prop&quot; industry as we know it is dead within 2 years, probably much less. That is a fact.
 Posted by Lights on 08-03-10 01:33 AM: 
 

The firms that are discussed here by the various posters are not prop firms. they are glorified retail firms that extend something called JBO leverage. that b/d rule has now been loopholed away from their original intent which was to provide leveraged market making in the70&apos;s. They then make traders into exchange members and payout something like 95-99%. Trader puts up a deposit and the moment he is down half his capital, he is cut down. When he approaches zero in his cap, he is completely shut down and asked to put up more capital. These firms are suffering the past few years because the principals of these firms are unwilling or unable to take any risk on trades and the HFT&apos;s know this. The HFT&apos;s are also the big swinging dicks and deepest pockets and can hold u over 48 hours, know everyone&apos;s open positions and screw everyone. the biggest swinging market making dick of all time. What&apos;s a thousand little subllc&apos;s with 100k up gonna do against these behemoths? They know where the easy stops are and where they are enforced by the firm prior to the close (since they don&apos;t want overnight risk). a trade that will make hundreds of thousands the next day will most likely need to be covered in an unrealized loss because these firms are not willing to risk anything. That model is over. The irony is that the big shops like GS and co. figured that out and said hey if 40% of the volume is done by this JBO thing why can&apos;t we? why can&apos;t we also f*ck the rules. If 40% of the total volume in the late 90&apos;s to mid 2000&apos;s were done by jBO&apos;ed props then it&apos;s ok right? so they went on and bot SLK, became specialists and now run the system. So the whole market making thing got abused and the funny thing is you guys inadvertently created HFT&apos;s. HFT is just an evolution of discretionary daytrading of the 90&apos;s, 9married puts, naked shorting, frontrunning, etc.

Btw, The true prop models are still chugging along. Why? because the owners risk their capital. I think what you had the past decade was a free for all. The free lunch is over. Anybody from just about any background could open up a prop subllc or b/d and markup clearing. That this model is now unsuccesful doesn&apos;t mean prop trading as a whole is ending. like how online brokers killed the stockbrokers in the 80&apos;s. like how the mouse replaced the telephone call. like how daytraders replaced the specialist firms, lebranche, etc. Adapt or die.

the truly remarkable thing is 95% of all daytrading volume through the thousands of trading firms out there is cleared thru 1 of 3 or 4 of the major clearing firms. they know ALL your positions yet you all choose your predator. and they also have a buyside desk which &quot;makes markets&quot; off that.

Never understood why trading firms never teamed to self clear themselves. REal geniuses in this biz.

What i find incredible is that don says some of his traders keep millions in there bright account. If thats the case why do they need bright?Having to take part of the profit is the last straw for many prop firms like bright and i expect a dieing industry as regulation kills it. Ita time for true traders to put up there own money and trade retail like the good old days. all this leverage is whats destroyed wall street,

Interesting as always. The higher volume guys pay .003, pretty competitive (unless compared to Canadian Swift business models).

And, if you read my posts...we do suggest that the guys with an extra few $million move a lot of their trading to retail. Not sure how to react to the &quot;extra commissions and 50%&quot; comment, since it is not factual. The 50% given to those with our zero risk plan is the only thing at 50%, and their commission can go as low as .002.

Just keeping it real....

 Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Bright Trading&apos;s new payout model 

Hi Don,

Regarding the &quot;top people (some who had fewer than 7 losing days this year..)&quot; you referenced below, what type of strategy do they use, are they pair traders? Also, what kind of risk:reward are such traders experiencing. Given the few losses, either they are infrequent traders or each loss consumes a month of profits...

Assuming that their wins are several times higher than the losses, I guess pair traders that average-in (layer-in) several times over the course of a few months would have have such an exceptional win:loss ratio.

thanks,

Walt

With all the pessimism out there (much of it rightfully so), it was nice to hear the good stuff.....and, as always, I&apos;m sure your top guys are doing well with the derivatives.

We, obviously, don&apos;t share any of our traders proprietary trading strategies. We do, however, share the general of &quot;what is working now, and what is not working now&quot; in general terms.

And, yes, most of our top people focus on pairs in one form or another.

What is the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; for a day trader who has to put up their own capital and take ALL losses against their contributions while also having to give up 20% of the profits?

Unless this 80/20 payout becomes the standard model for the prop industry, there are other options, such as joining a CBSX (where .003 is common, and without volume minimums), or as mentioned by another post: &quot;trade retail like the good old days.&quot;

Don, I&apos;m curious why you have the 1000 share threshold on your rates? For these smaller traders, you are encouraging them to trade size that maybe they should not be trading. Hell when I started trading at Worldco back in 2000 I had a 100 share limit to start. And even when I was trading 300k shares a day, I would say 75% of my traders were under 1000 shares per order. In fact many of them were 100 share orders when I carried 5k to 8k share positions. The reason for this is we liked to tick the listed stocks. Do you think it&apos;s smart to incentivize newer and smaller traders to trade that kind of size?

BTW, I got your messages.

Trading 1000 shares today IMO is a lot less risky than it was 15 years ago when I started trading full time. First, back then you were looking at spreads of 1/8 or sometimes 1/4. Right off the bat you could lose $125 or $250 if the market moved. Today with penny spreads your risk is less; you have more time to bail, and minimize losses. Second, back then commissions were much higher than today, so you have another advantage today. Finally, no one forces any trader to trade 1000 shares. Trading less shares may result in higher commissions but that&apos;s really not a big deal IMO. Last, one need not trade 1000 GOOG -- there are plenty of lower priced stocks that can have great intra-day movement where 1000 shares isn&apos;t a big amount of capital to have on the line.

Well I guess you could say i&apos;ve never done a lot of volume (i&apos;ve always had longer timeframes), but i&apos;ve been VERY vocal especially to newer traders of the affect in haircuts....I&apos;ve seen accounts firsthand get bled to nothing because of them, it&apos;s a horrible thing to hear.

Going back to the 20%, Bright still has a lot of things in the works about how this can be adjusted for traders in other services. Although I&apos;m sure the guys doing big volume (as Don suggested maybe go elsewhere) would not do be with the firm for long, so that is a loss....

It is perfectly normal to see &quot;your trader&apos;s&quot; positions as someone who runs a group or trading firm. 1) If and when they blow through their capital it is your money that is being bled, and 2) If you are training you can learn a lot about a trader&apos;s (bad) habits from seeing their activity. Normally you&apos;re just looking mainly at trader&apos;s p/l to manage risk, but have ability to drill down on any detail, and all depends on kind of operation.

Exactly, Bright is no longer in the commission game, they are in the lending money game. Nothing wrong with that in itself, but it affects the advice they give to their traders, which is frequently not in traders best interests but in the interests of Brights bottom line. For example,

They bashed low-volume intra-day momentum trading in favor of first, high-volume scalping of low-priced stocks in the earlier part of this decade, and second, in favor of overnight pairs during the last few years. They are not in the business of traders making the most money for themselves, they are in the business of making the most off traders that they can. Again, nothing wrong with that, but they shot themselves in the foot by not partnering with better traders in a true prop model in favor of incubating mediocre traders that they could steadily milk over the years. Those traders that could barely make a living before are just bleeding away now. Meanwhile the true prop shops that worked to maximize their traders&apos; take-home (sometimes at the expense of the owners&apos; bottom line in the short term) have committed highly skilled traders with the capital to be patient in low-vol, HFT difficult markets.

You also see it in their encouragement of low-capital traders to carry large overnight positions - &quot;only&quot; 2%, 4%, 6% haircut interest works out to 13%, 27%, and 40% returns on Bright&apos;s capital (with 6.66 leverage) - no wonder they want guys to break even and hold the maximum amount of overnights, and no wonder they dont want traders putting up large amounts of capital. And no wonder they bash the hedge fund model - they dont want well-capitalized traders paying profits to investors to manage/borrow their money, Bright wants to charge the haircut themselves. Meanwhile when those traders struggle, they take 100% of the losses at Bright and have no cushion or support.

Bright can run their business any way they want to, and they are certainly not the only churn-and-burn prop shop, but they are one of the more outspoken ones in claiming that they aren&apos;t churning-and-burning, which seems a little off.

Again, nothing wrong with that, but they shot themselves in the foot by not partnering with better traders in a true prop model in favor of incubating mediocre traders that they could steadily milk over the years. Those traders that could barely make a living before are just bleeding away now. Meanwhile the true prop shops that worked to maximize their traders&apos; take-home (sometimes at the expense of the owners&apos; bottom line in the short term) have committed highly skilled traders with the capital to be patient in low-vol, HFT difficult markets.

You also see it in their encouragement of low-capital traders to carry large overnight positions - &quot;only&quot; 2%, 4%, 6% haircut interest works out to 13%, 27%, and 40% returns on Bright&apos;s capital (with 6.66 leverage) - no wonder they want guys to break even and hold the maximum amount of overnights, and no wonder they dont want traders putting up large amounts of capital. And no wonder they bash the hedge fund model - they dont want well-capitalized traders paying profits to investors to manage/borrow their money, Bright wants to charge the haircut themselves. Meanwhile when those traders struggle, they take 100% of the losses at Bright and have no cushion or support.

Bright can run their business any way they want to, and they are certainly not the only churn-and-burn prop shop, but they are one of the more outspoken ones in claiming that they aren&apos;t churning-and-burning, which seems a little off. 

your post answers the question in main why Bright has never commented on the FTT (financial transaction tax)

That&apos;s what Goldman argued too.

 Quote from USAtrader: 

 It is perfectly normal to see &quot;your trader&apos;s&quot; positions as someone who runs a group or trading firm. 1) If and when they blow through their capital it is your money that is being bled, and 2) If you are training you can learn a lot about a trader&apos;s (bad) habits from seeing their activity. Normally you&apos;re just looking mainly at trader&apos;s p/l to manage risk, but have ability to drill down on any detail, and all depends on kind of operation.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 I&apos;m not sure I understand the question. If you are asking about payouts we are at 95%. However we back some of our market makers so there is a bigger profit split there. 
What arrangement or set up is at 95%.....is that the futures proprietary or equities only model?

TIA!

BTW, I have always heard good things about your firm!

I remind everyone this thread is about Bright&apos;s payout model so please stay on topic. If you want to have an ongoing discussion with someone else about their firm please do it via PM. And this is not a thread about Maverick&apos;s firm (who has promised me, on many occasions, that he will not discuss here even if it&apos;s just answering questions ). Thanks.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Don, I&apos;m curious why you have the 1000 share threshold on your rates? For these smaller traders, you are encouraging them to trade size that maybe they should not be trading. Hell when I started trading at Worldco back in 2000 I had a 100 share limit to start. And even when I was trading 300k shares a day, I would say 75% of my traders were under 1000 shares per order. In fact many of them were 100 share orders when I carried 5k to 8k share positions. The reason for this is we liked to tick the listed stocks. Do you think it&apos;s smart to incentivize newer and smaller traders to trade that kind of size?

BTW, I got your messages. 

Don, would love to get a response to this earlier question. I know a previous poster mentioned 1000 shares is not what it use to be however I would argue that really depends on capitalization. If it&apos;s true that Don really is taking guys in with 10k (which I highly doubt) but 1k shares is a lot of risk not just in trading terms but in terms of commissions. A guy can easily blow through 10k in 3 months while trading flat gross.

Actually this is a complete failed mentality imo....why not compare various prop models in this thread under the current market and regulatory conditions. It is very obvious things are changing right before our eyes and this overly sensitive approach to some of these threads is very disappointing imo. And I do not give a damn if this firm or that firm does or does not advertise here.....sheeesh. So we only get to talk about firms who advertise here.....come on???

If mav had initiated promoting his firm that is one thing, but I asked a very simple question and I have been here since 2002 for cripes sake......and much of this thread is a stupid back and forth between some posters......lets get that garbage resolved and move on with discussions about prop payouts (of course the Bright model too).

Bob is not even here to answer the Q&apos;s so lets get something of value to talk about.......OTHER PROPS!

firms that don&apos;t require any trader deposit or desk fees or software feees are true prop firms and they don&apos;t hire anyone who don&apos;t make profits.

they fire any trader who don&apos;t make profit. 80% of his customers would be gone than.

it&apos;s over if traders put their own capital say 10K plus have to pay 20% of profits...why 20% is a lot of slippage. Don has always been against pay 20% of profits for using somebody else&apos;s capital if you ahve your own capital.

This ultimatum or order from Goldman Sachs is just polite way of saying your operation is being shut down.

the fact they even offer 80/20 plus having you deposit capital min $10K really says of their arrogance and think traders are stupid. FU goldman sachs

and why do you need to spend $500 for a series 7 trading your account..more money for training course..total b.s.

series 7 or these certificates from finra is for people working in banks or brokerage firms dealing with clients. any retard can trade their own account..but the industry doesn&apos;t want retards dealing with clients..giving bad information.. every industry has these &apos;certificates&apos; the series 7 is like security gaurd certificate...anyone can take it.

Our $10K plan is accompanied by a &quot;stress test&quot; of sorts. We have accepted dozens of younger people, recent college grads etc. with that amount. Of course, all new traders start with 100 shares or so, regardless of deposit.

The first few months are used to build up consistency and confidence, not overall dollar profits. If the trader feels comfortable trading more shares, then, and only then, should they increase their size.

Our traders are treated as private fund managers, and are trained to all the tasks of such - risk control and accounting is certainly a big part of that task. Their &quot;business within our business&quot; is up to them, within risk parameters of course (we do our best to protect them from themselves).

Just today, I had conversations with managers who had a few traders who have lost money or 2 months -basically said &quot;fix it&quot; - or &quot;I&apos;ll have to.&quot;

Now back to your Firm, LOL.....

Ok Don. Good answer. BTW, have you ever thought about running for office? You have a way with words that I&apos;m sure would make even Harry Reid proud.

Let&apos;s try this. So new guy comes in with 10k (fresh out of school youngster of course). So he is basically paying .0050 per share. Let&apos;s say he trades 20k shares a day (10k each way). That&apos;s $100 per day in commissions. That&apos;s 2k a month. In 5 months, assuming he trades flat gross (a very, very optimistic assumption), he will blow out his account without losing a single dollar in the market.

Where am I going wrong Don?

I give Don 100% credit for that. The reason I&apos;m asking him these questions is because I know he will answer them to some degree. Even if he is doing his best Harry Reid impersonation.

Don&apos;s a former Marine so I have to pay him respect for that as well.

Well my friend, evidently you haven&apos;t been to my boot camp (a free offer anytime, just for you).

20,000 shares per day! I would (and have) screamed at newbies for doing 5,000 shares per day without a plan.

First couple of months, maybe 3 or 4 openings at 100 or 200 shares max. Then maybe add a couple of pairs and a child stock.

More like 2,000 - 2,500 per day (after the first couple of weeks) - as I said, we need to develop a comfort level with these new people - no &quot;cowboys&quot; - no &quot;grandstanding&quot; - Maybe $10-$25 per day...

I do suggest that, after they are are comfortable and consistent that they slowly move up to 400-500 per trade where applicable. These days, we use 100 share orders to &quot;outsmart&quot; the HFT traders (seems to work, and even if we do get front run, much smaller damage with 100 dhares).

Now, I assume your Firm brings on more established traders and/or has a one-on-one system and wants higher volume immediately, and rightfully so. We want, as my brother says &quot;butts in front of computers&quot; next year and the years to come vs. any immediate &quot;hit and run&quot; (don&apos;t mis-read this anyone - Mav doesn&apos;t either, they run a good outfit, solid people).

It&apos;s tough enough as it is, adding volume pressure just doesn&apos;t help. As things have changed over the last 18 years, we have modified our training to reflect these changes.

Thanks for the Reid compliment (Of course you meant it that way, LOL), but I just respond openly - much to the chagrin o Compliance at times, but so be it.

Don

Can&apos;t wait to get back to Chicago - time to share few more bottles of wine my friend.

what will this mean for prop trading in general?
where will the money shift to?
how will it affect the &quot;outside&quot; props?
and will it finally increase volume and volatility now that the money is being pushed outside the bank walls out into the private sector of hedges and props?

I had responded earlier about 1000 shares today being a different ballgame than 15 years ago. Whether Prop or retail, a good manager wouldn&apos;t allow a newbie to trade 20K shares per day IMO. I started at All Tech in &apos;96 and it was strongly encouraged to trade 200 shares per trade. We got some dirt cheap commission (at the time) of $3 for the first month or two. IMO it&apos;s all about developing confidence, building on some winning trades even if they&apos;re netting you peanuts. Stepping up too quickly to trade size and you can be like a deer in headlights if a stock tanks and a new trader freezes, refusing to take the loss. With time a trader will know WHEN it&apos;s time to increase size.

I suspect most any decent prop firm, such as Bright, would also nurture new traders early on. After all they want them to succeed.

All good questions - my initial thought is that I&apos;m happy to not have to complete with my Clearing Firm&apos;s prop traders.

In reality, and with what is happening at ML/BofA (being forced to separate I&apos;m told) - that is what is happening - restructure.

We&apos;ll see...

Seems we&apos;re on the same page. Yeah, I remember Harvey Houtkin very well - quite a guy. And, 200 shares for $3 bucks - a bargain, LOL. May he rest in peace.

One step at a time in trading, as with all business ventures IMO.

Let me re-phrase what I&apos;m trying to say. A trader with 10k in capital has close to zero chance of ever making it. I know that, Don Bright knows that, Bob Bright knows that and everyone on the street knows that. This is what I was trying to get at when questioning Don about taking in 10k accounts, or youngsters as he likes to call them.

Look, when I started at Worldco back in 2000, we had arguably one of the best markets in history to trade. The only way we could produce good traders was to let them go anywhere from 25k to 100k deep in the red in their accounts. Even the guys that came in with capital, usually 10k to 20k, we let them go 50k into firm money. The good ones dug their way out and did well. The bad ones we cut. Net net they never really lost that much money on them as it was mostly commissions.

I know I&apos;m not suppose to say this but the biggest fraud of the prop firm business is not commissions, or leverage, or whether or not you need a series 7, it&apos;s the fact that firms sells the dream of success to young guys that don&apos;t know any better. Well I do know better. I know it not because I&apos;m a smart ass trying to pick a fight with Don, this really has little to do with Don in particular, it has to do with the fact that I&apos;ve been in this business for 10 years and have been around over 1000 traders who have gone through the system. I know the numbers because I&apos;ve seen the numbers.

There is a direct correlation between the amount of capital you have to trade and your odds of success. Not leverage, CAPITAL! These numbers are indisputable. I know them, I&apos;ve seen them.

At the end of the day, after 10 years, I realized the biggest edge in this business is not computers, not charts, not leverage, but equity. Pure old fashioned good american equity. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they are probably trying to sell you something.

In the current market environmet, what do you think should be the mininum capital that a trader should have in order to have a chance at day trading success? By the term &quot;success&quot;, I mean making enough to earn a decent living at it.

for an experienced trader, agreed. for a newbie, though, the biggest edge is actually having an edge, and the second biggest edge (assuming you have the first) is low operating costs.

i started with $2500, a low rate (.0035), and most important, an edge that i had spent more than a year developing. i&apos;d researched risk mgmt, kept my per trade risk tiny and took enough shots with low costs and was able to build that up. no fanatasy, no pipe dream, just smart trading and tight risk control. it wasn&apos;t until i was 3 years in, after building a decent roll, where i was able to leverage my experience and track record to get a firm to put some equity behind me and make some real money.

at the time, bright was charging a penny in commissions. i remember that well, because i knew that i would&apos;ve blown out if i had gone with them. to be fair, they were providing training on an edge that still existed at the time (the infamous opening orders). these days their value-add strategy wise is a ship that has long sailed. which just leaves costs, and truly they&apos;re easily the least competitve firm in that category and given the small-edge environment i have no idea why anyone still considers doing business with them. actually, i do: if they don&apos;t know any better.

if i were running a prop today, there&apos;s no way i&apos;d let some newbie off the street eat up 10k of my capital let alone 50. on principle alone. why should anyone with no experience, no track record, and having done no work be worthy of my risk? what i would consider, is if they came to me with a prospective edge that they&apos;d studied, put some work into, thought about, ie shown some initiative. the only other possibility for letting someone with no experience on my desk would be to work an edge i couldn&apos;t automate. if i wasn&apos;t doing that (being discriminating), the ONLY edge i&apos;d have as a prop firm is to milk on fees, haircuts and commissions.... which, in a highly efficient market, is a very poor business model. i wish the bright&apos;s luck.
 Posted by NY0BScalper on 08-05-10 12:34 AM: 
 

I have to say, I don&apos;t want to tie up more than $5-10k in capital if I can avoid it and still get full service. I opened up with a firm with $5k and turned the account into six figures... I knew how to trade, but if I didn&apos;t have the chance to trade with such a small amount, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to have been successful.

The attrition rate is horrible. But if you&apos;re a good trader you can take $5-10k and, with decent leverage, make $300-500/day until you build some bank up. Probably less than 3% of the guys who open at at these shops are actually capable of doing that, but it can still be done.

I agree with propseeker. Equity is not the most important thing. I knew a lot of semi wealthy people that tried to trade and lost it all. It&apos;s about having an edge. I&apos;d rather have an edge and start with 20k than to start with 200k and no edge. I also started with low capital base and built it up over time.

No, an edge is a given. An edge with no equity will get you no where. Look, you guys that talk about spending years building your account. How did you live? With mom and dad? You need capital whether it&apos;s money to trade or savings to live on while you are learning to trade. Even if it takes one 2 years to refine their edge, so how are you living. If you live in a decent size city the average person is going to need about 30k to 40k per year and that is living like a hermit. So two years that&apos;s 60k to 80k assuming you never lose a dime trading.

No sorry man you need the capital. An edge is worthless until you build the skill necessary to use it. It&apos;s like a high performance sports car. You just hand the keys to a 16 year old kid and expect him to be able to handle it even though the car itself is amazing. It takes skill to drive a high performance car. And it takes skill to refine and execute your edge. Edge itself is meaningless. I worked on the floor of the CBOE back when options had .50 spreads on the bid and offer. It was easy money for anyone that knew how to calculate synthetics. Yet guys still blew out their accounts taking unnecessary risk. There is nothing about this business that&apos;s easy. Getting an edge is not enough.

I knew guys in high school that bench pressed 450 lbs and squatted 600 that ran 4.40 40&apos;s. Yet they couldn&apos;t keep their life together to handle a full ride scholarship. Capital buys you time. And every trader needs time, lots of it. It&apos;s the most valuable currency to any trader. And no, just because you have capital does not mean you have a prayer to make it as a trader. I never said that. The two things are mutually exclusive. In fact even with unlimited amount of capital your odds are still pretty small.

I guess we have a different definition of an edge. My definition is not just an idea of how to make money. My definition of an edge is that you already have the skill.

It doesn&apos;t matter how we define what edge is, it still has to be acquired. You can&apos;t just buy edge on Craigslist. It takes time to get that edge. I&apos;m talking about guys just starting out. They need TIME. And time is not free. It cost money. Without it you can never acquire, develop or create your edge.

There is no doubt in my mind that Paul Tudor Jones or Steve Cohen could open an account at Bright Trading with 5k and build up a stake. That is not who Bright is recruiting in his boot camps.

who said anything about how you acquire an edge(on craigslist)?? all I said was that an edge is more important than capital. if you have an edge (the ability to make money) than you can start with 20k. i&apos;m not sure why all these issues are brought into it. reread what i said. i know an edge is hard to attain. been there, done that.

We&apos;ll have to agree to disagree. Many hedge funds blew up in 2008 not because they did not have an edge, but because they ran out of capital. You have to understand that an edge is not a license to print money or even make money. Capital gets you through the drawdowns. Also when one edge runs out, another must be acquired. All that takes capital.

Anyway my argument deals with new traders. You can give a new trader all the edges in the world, but if they don&apos;t have the capital behind them to buy the time to learn how to actually trade, it really doesn&apos;t matter. Even Don will tell you that only a small percentage of the bootcampers he brings in ever really makes any kind of money. And supposedly they are learning an &quot;edge&quot;.

Once you are already a profitable trader there are a whole new set of variables you have to contend with. But that is not what I am arguing.

maybe i misunderstood you, but i thought you were talking about new traders making it and the best model for that (brights, etc). from that context, i don&apos;t see how an edge is a given. to answer your question, i didn&apos;t have a life... i worked nights about 6-8 hrs and then came home and did another 6-8 hours developing/trading. weekends were great because i got to dedicate a full 12-16 hours to trading. now, i still work 12-16, but sometimes i take weekends off ;). you gotta pay to play, imo.
 No sorry man you need the capital. An edge is worthless until you build the skill necessary to use it. It&apos;s like a high performance sports car. You [don&apos;t] just hand the keys to a 16 year old kid and expect him to be able to handle it even though the car itself is amazing. It takes skill to drive a high performance car. And it takes skill to refine and execute your edge. Edge itself is meaningless. 
well, if an edge is worthless without skill, then i can only think of one thing even more worthless: no edge with no skill and tons of cash. an edge isn&apos;t a race car, an edge is a car with a working engine, some wheels, maybe some seatbelts. capital, is like juicing your engine with nos. wouldn&apos;t you want to make sure your car had some decent wheels and seatbelts first? especially if you have no idea if the kid can even drive? personally, i&apos;d let the kid drive the honda for a bit before we started juicing his ride, but i&apos;d make damn sure the car wasn&apos;t a lemon, because it&apos;s my ass if he wrecks.

anyway, i get your point, just not the degree. capital IS important, and it&apos;s a good thing that you&apos;re investing in your traders like that. i&apos;m not trying to diss your model. shops that are setup with competitve rates, profit sharing and good capital backing are miles ahead of the &apos;plankton&apos;/cannon fodder model. i&apos;m just saying, if i were starting out again, i wouldn&apos;t want it any other way.

We actually to agree that more starting capital is better - but my point is that a more skilled person is also better (read: younger recent grad, with great computer and some programming skills vs. someone we have to start from scratch with - no offense to anyone) - and that trading is very scalable, size wise.

Bob and I have agreed to conduct a more thorough interview process for those who, due to their youth etc. perhaps only have $10K...and, we have our JVc program participants to help with our analysis and review.

Don I&apos;ll chat with you when I have some downtime. Really busy with a lot of stuff though. I know we have had very long conversations in the past about capital and success and you and I were 100% in agreement that these firms with the 5k and 10k down model were a joke and now you seem to have changed your tune. Now I know times are tough in terms of recruiting new traders, but you really should be raising your standards now, not relaxing them.

Markets themselves are never good or bad.

Goldman To Spin-Off Proprietary Business As Hedge Fund
Aug 5 2010 | 1:45pm ET
The next really big hedge fund launch is likely to be the regulator-required spin-off of Goldman Sachs proprietary trading business.
Goldman Sachs plans to close its Principal Strategies business and transform it into a hedge fund, Bloomberg News reports. An announcement could come as soon as tomorrow, with the spin-off coming by the end of the year.
It is still unclear how much the GSPS team, led by Morgan Sze, hopes to raise in outside capital, or what role, if any, Goldman will have in the new hedge fund. The newly-passed Dodd-Frank financial regulation reform bars banks from proprietary trading, but allows them to invest up to 3% of their capital in hedge funds.
Goldman appears to be trying to beat other firms to the punch: Under the provisions of the so-called Volcker rule, banks have up to four years to wind down their prop. desks. The move also comes as Morgan Stanley is reportedly finalizing plans to spin-off its FrontPoint Partners hedge fund.
Goldman does not disclose how much GSPS manages. But prop. trading accounts for about 10%, on average, of its annual revenue.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 All good questions - my initial thought is that I&apos;m happy to not have to complete with my Clearing Firm&apos;s prop traders.

In reality, and with what is happening at ML/BofA (being forced to separate I&apos;m told) - that is what is happening - restructure.

We&apos;ll see...

The spin-off will be scrutinized to the n-th degree. No way it will be a success.

 80/20 profit split 

As Far as the 80/20 payout - Couldn&apos;t you just give free commissions&amp;interest up to 20% of the traders profits? If possible, that would be a good work around. Giving up 20% is a hell of a lot for taking most of the risk.

My understanding is that under this business model trader deposits are no longer allowed. So the risk falls fully on the firm. Correct Don?

That is not the spirit of the regulation motivating the 80/20 split in the first place.

Unless you folks are designing some workaround where the trader also shares in the profits of the firm, the standard model is going to be gone if/when the SEC weighs in in its official capacity.

 Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: 80/20 profit split 

Or rather, I would, but under a totally different structure. Commissions, risk capital, losses, leverage would all have to fundamentally change from the past models. At least for experienced traders. Rookies, 80/20 probably makes sense. I thought all the props used this as the starting point...

Sure there is probably a lot of things Don is working on right now as we speak and every one of them cuts into his operating margins big time. The pie just keeps getting smaller and smaller. Don is the equivalent of a buggy whip salesman that that refuses to accept the concept of the automobile.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Let me re-phrase what I&apos;m trying to say. A trader with 10k in capital has close to zero chance of ever making it. I know that, Don Bright knows that, Bob Bright knows that and everyone on the street knows that. This is what I was trying to get at when questioning Don about taking in 10k accounts, or youngsters as he likes to call them.

Look, when I started at Worldco back in 2000, we had arguably one of the best markets in history to trade. The only way we could produce good traders was to let them go anywhere from 25k to 100k deep in the red in their accounts. Even the guys that came in with capital, usually 10k to 20k, we let them go 50k into firm money. The good ones dug their way out and did well. The bad ones we cut. Net net they never really lost that much money on them as it was mostly commissions.

I know I&apos;m not suppose to say this but the biggest fraud of the prop firm business is not commissions, or leverage, or whether or not you need a series 7, it&apos;s the fact that firms sells the dream of success to young guys that don&apos;t know any better. Well I do know better. I know it not because I&apos;m a smart ass trying to pick a fight with Don, this really has little to do with Don in particular, it has to do with the fact that I&apos;ve been in this business for 10 years and have been around over 1000 traders who have gone through the system. I know the numbers because I&apos;ve seen the numbers.

There is a direct correlation between the amount of capital you have to trade and your odds of success. Not leverage, CAPITAL! These numbers are indisputable. I know them, I&apos;ve seen them.

At the end of the day, after 10 years, I realized the biggest edge in this business is not computers, not charts, not leverage, but equity. Pure old fashioned good american equity. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they are probably trying to sell you something.

 Re: Re: maverick 

&quot;Don&quot; (i.e. the industry), should be looking at converting their shops to hedge/prop trading funds using bank capital in a new secondary tier to bypass the pathetic 3% restriction the volker rule has imposed.

to assume GS and the followers won&apos;t find ways to dump more than the 3% outside their leftover prop shops in the four years they have left to rape the system for as much as they can, would be to assumed a fool.

so yes, &quot;someone&quot; should do this...
be interesting to see who comes out of the gate first with the best model.

Net net they never really lost that much money on them as it was mostly commissions.

I know I&apos;m not suppose to say this but the biggest fraud of the prop firm business is not commissions, or leverage, or whether or not you need a series 7, it&apos;s the fact that firms sells the dream of success to young guys that don&apos;t know any better. Well I do know better. I know it not because I&apos;m a smart ass trying to pick a fight with Don, this really has little to do with Don in particular, it has to do with the fact that I&apos;ve been in this business for 10 years and have been around over 1000 traders who have gone through the system. I know the numbers because I&apos;ve seen the numbers.

There is a direct correlation between the amount of capital you have to trade and your odds of success. Not leverage, CAPITAL! These numbers are indisputable. I know them, I&apos;ve seen them.

At the end of the day, after 10 years, I realized the biggest edge in this business is not computers, not charts, not leverage, but equity. Pure old fashioned good american equity. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they are probably trying to sell you something. 

This is probably one of the best posts I have seen here in some time! Give a newbie with 10-20k 100:1, and he&apos;s a gonner sooner than later.

Maverick needs to get paid for that post!

what im learning is position sizing is important these days. I have friends who are used to trading 50 lots in the bonds who now trade 10 lots with the intention to add. I personally got smoked in 09 trying to jump in with the spurs jingling and jangling trading equities. Maverick thanks for the insight.

 Quote from JamesVU2000: 

 No one is going to make any money until the US fixes its longterm problems. No one is killing it this year. HFT is bogus, it was great in 08 and now there is no money in it 

Interesting -- I&apos;ve been wondering how the HFT&apos;s are doing, now that markets seem to be becoming mercilessly efficient in the short term. IBKR is, by my reckoning, one of the largest (as well as one of the original) HFT firms -- the IB brokerage was seemingly tacked on to their existing HFT model, somehow magically making them a non-HFT in the minds of the press. That said, going forward they might indeed become more of a broker than a market maker given how much market making margins are shrinking.

I wonder how the others such as Automated Trading Desk, GETCO, Wolverine, Optiver, Tradeworx, etc. are doing in this environment.

Mark my words, the commission model for equities is over. 

I&apos;m not arguing with you, I&apos;m just kinda curious as to why you believe the commission business is dead.

In both models really the trader is doing the same thing... trading.
So I&apos;m not really sure what the difference is by charging him commissions or by charging him a % of profits like a hedge fund.

I don&apos;t understand how one model can work and one model not work, when really they are the same thing, at the end of the day the firm gets a %... either in the form of commissions or % of profits

You are not making sense. Assuming profits is very weak and a recipe for total disaster for anyone.

How can you have a % of profits if there are NO PROFITS?

You can always make commission vig--trader wins or loses.

 Re: Re: Re: Re: 80/20 profit split 

The only reason I could come up with for DB or any prop to move to a standardised 80/20 model is because they can&apos;t possibly remain or become profitable under existing business commissions, likely because of lowering commission incomes, risk tolerance is too low, underlying risk capital is too fragile or nonexistant, and overall trading profitability has decreased into the red, or is nil, or will be projected nil into the future.
The only way to incentivise a trader to give up 15%+ more of his profits would be to trade firm capital under a hedge fund model, as a contracted employee/member of the firm, with combined profit-sharing, benefits, bonuses, etc. similar to existing bank/ib prop terms.
Otherwise, yes, I agree with Maverick, BD prop will be dead.
What I don&apos;t agree with Maverick is that GS doesn&apos;t know what it&apos;s doing in it&apos;s own restructuring. GS is not a firm I would ever bet against, not under even the worst of economic or political circumstances. They will always find the loopholes.

 Quote from Fractal: 

 That is not the spirit of the regulation motivating the 80/20 split in the first place.

Unless you folks are designing some workaround where the trader also shares in the profits of the firm, the standard model is going to be gone if/when the SEC weighs in in its official capacity.

 Re: Re: Re: 80/20 profit split 

Listen people, you&apos;re all climbing up the wrong tree here. They&apos;re closing down retail shops who pretend to be prop like the people who run co&apos;s here. If a prop takes 100% of the risk, they could pay out 1000% of the profit if they wanted to. You&apos;re right Maverick, the 20 year loophole is over.

 False. Trader puts up 100% of the risk.

I&apos;m not sure if you selectively read what Don writes, but his firm is a prop firm now that he backs traders in 50% split accounts 100% firm risk alongside the trader capital accounts. I have no affiliation with Bright, but I think you are being a bit unfair with what he&apos;s explained. If a firm shares risk with trader, they are by definition, prop.

Actually this is not completely true. Let me explain. In order to get this so called &quot;backed account&quot; you need to already fund a regular 25k account. So essentially you have 25k with the firm. Then Don creates a separate sub account for the JVC account or whatever he calls it. You have to fund your own account to get this sub account. And the account is only 10k. And if it loses 5k you are shut off. Don knows he is going to make that in commissions and haircut charges on your 25k account. I may be off on the exact details but this is the general idea.

Look, any firm will do that deal. Shit I&apos;ll do that deal for you. And to top it off they take 50% of the profits. What they are doing is using your own commissions to fund a side account in which they can earn more commissions and a split from.

Look, I&apos;m not saying Don is doing anything bad with this program, I just see all the angles. I know all the tricks. I&apos;m in the freaking business. I&apos;m speaking from a position of honesty here that prop firms are trying to do anything they can to generate business. This is really not all that different from the firms that charge you 5k for education then tell you that you are trading firm money. That is until you lose the 5k.

Let me be clear again, Don is not doing anything dishonest here. I&apos;m not accusing his firm of that. What he is doing is manipulating the balance sheet so it&apos;s a win win for the firm and it doesn&apos;t really cost them a penny. Surely you see what they are doing.

Just to keep it &quot;real&quot; and civil, of course. Many of our traders have only $5k or so in their &quot;normal&quot; accounts - this has worked to help &quot;save&quot; struggling traders who have been helped by the discipline provided by the &quot;free&quot; account. Some started with $10k, some with $15k, and some with more.

Many who would have &quot;gone away&quot; now have made $40K-$50K or so in the last few months. Many have made more money in their &quot;normal&quot; accounts too, with the help of the &quot;group&quot; mentoring.

We are anticipating heading more in the prop direction based on our &quot;experts&quot; - but want to provide the highest payout opportunities possible in the meantime.

Commission rates for the &quot;free&quot; account start lower, and go to under our actual costs (as low as .002 at this point, perhaps to zero in the future).

I know you&apos;re a sharp guy Mav, &quot;seeing all the angles&quot; - but sometimes these &quot;angles&quot; can be a positive thing for both parties. If we collect 3% on capital use (pretty cheap, right?), and trader keeps half or more of the profits...well, that seems pretty good to me.

In my old age, I honestly feel that the only &quot;good deals&quot; are those who work for both parties. Sure, we need to make some money, but so do the traders...not too much to over-think here. Heck, we may end changing our minds if this doesn&apos;t work - eat the losses, if any, and try something else. We have made mistakes before, but hopefully this isn&apos;t one of them.

(as far as &quot;manipulating&quot; - I don&apos;t really see anything close to that) (As far as no risk, let me say that the last time we attempted this type of thing - our &quot;portfolio&quot; room - it cost us $millions , but we hope we learned enough to help with this latest venture).

Tired of editing, LOL...trying to make sure to address all your comments. The &quot;use your own commissions&quot; etc. Well, guess what...most JVC members have slowed down their &quot;normal&quot; trading by a lot, opting for the &quot;free&quot; account.

I honestly think you may been reading too much into all of this, Mav. I&apos;ve been pretty open (sorry Diane, I know, &quot;loose lips&quot; and all that - Diane is my Compliance Officer)....In the words of my famous friend &quot;Vinni&quot; - &quot;It is what it is&quot; - LOL.

Traders have been asking, some begging, for years come in with less money, offering to split profits....the timing is right, we came up with theis idea, started in January, have about 170 in the program now....so far so good, keeping fingers crossed.

Missing from this discussion is the simple fact that there is a trade-off between risk and opportunity. You can get hired as a trader by a hedge fund (or until now by Goldman Sachs, etc) and paid a six-figure salary with plenty of capital and training, etc. That&apos;s a great opportunity for the very select few who have the connections, style, temperament, etc to make the cut.

For the rest of us (especially us &quot;slow learners&quot;), we have to invest in ourselves because nobody else will. That&apos;s where the &quot;capital contribution&quot; and &quot;independent retail&quot; models comes in.

I haven&apos;t done business with Bright Trading, but my impression is generally favorable. At least they&apos;re not advertising trader &quot;jobs&quot; on monster.com (I don&apos;t think they are, anyway). Bright Trading seem to understand the need for their traders to have a shot at longer-term survival.

Don 

OK Don, let me take a stab at this. BTW, you must love all this advertising I&apos;m giving your firm. As the saying goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity.

Maybe I&apos;m not as smart as I thought I was Don. Because I read your posts and realize that I don&apos;t understand a single word of it. I&apos;m going to have to stop by Borders this weekend and pick up the latest copy of gobbly gook speaking for dummies.

So let me get this straight, a trader comes in to your firm, let&apos;s say with 5k (I&apos;m really struggling to believe you do this) and opens account A. This is so called &quot;regular account&quot;. He doesn&apos;t make any money so he decides to take advantage of the JVC opportunity that Bright is offering him. So now he has account B (the JVC account) and suddenly the guy is making money.

This makes no sense to me. Whatever strategy he is using in account B, surely he could do this in account A. How does he suddenly become a profitable trader by trading in a different sub account. You teach these guys to trade pairs. What difference does it make which account it&apos;s in?

My next issue is one that you seem to keep avoiding. Your margins are getting killed and with every post you write you seem to confirm this. A few years ago you were charging guys a penny a share, now you are charging guys just over cost and perhaps under cost in the JVC account. You then talk about losing millions in your last venture with backing traders. And somehow I am suppose to believe you guys have a viable operation going forward.

Don pretend you are an outside investor. Pretend you have never worked in the investment industry and you are looking to make a private equity investment into this company called &quot;Bright Trading&quot;. And you read all the things you are posting here. You see the margins getting crushed with each qtr. You hear the owners talk about losing millions on backing traders. You hear the firm is going to make little if any commissions going forward. Can you honestly tell me you would make an investment into this trading firm?

Next issue. Don, I have a buddy that attended one of your &quot;boot camps&quot;. This guy really wanted to trade with you. He&apos;s a good guy and a good trader. You told him he needed to come in with 20k. There was no mention of coming in with 5k. There was no talk of you letting him just come into this JVC program. All he got was a hard pitch to sign up and pay for an additional training program.

So Don, I&apos;m going to find out now if you are a man of your word. If my buddy calls you back. He has already given you 1k. Will you offer him a so called backed account? Will you honor your word? Will you let him into your JVC program?

I have no ulterior motive here Don. I just hear a totally different story from guys that attend your boot camps. Guys that call you up and ask what the deal is. Guys that actually trade in your firm. Now in this particular instance, this &quot;guy&quot; is a friend of mine and I would like to help him out. The problem is the deal you are talking about on here is not the deal you offered him. This guy is not some youngster out of school, he has been trading for over a decade.

And what happened to that guy that you talked about on here that went debit into your firm for over 7 figures on a pair gone bad. You said he was a good guy and he was good for it and he would pay you back. Ever seen any of that money?

Either you guys are running a business that has no chance of making any money going forward or something is not adding up here. Don I do appreciate you answering these questions. The only reason I&apos;m riding you so hard is because you are really the only firm that is on this forum talking about the industry. So the bad news is you have to take this shit from me. The good news is you get to make your story heard and get a lot of good exposure. At the end of the day, I maybe wrong on all my assessments of your firm. And when I am wrong, I will admit it. It&apos;s just that what you are posting does not add up. There is something missing here. Anyway, the floor is yours...

First off, you&apos;re absolutely correct - no fewer than 30 calls and emails referring to this thread, LOL....all good, and after chatting, everyone seems to have a better understanding of what we&apos;re doing.

Now, to your friend. If he came to training, I suggest that he come again in September (free of course, much more info, added extra days etc.). If he funds an account, and stays the 90 day period showing dedication and discipline (hopefully profitability), then he would be an ideal candidate for the JVC program. Hopefully his JVC mentoring, meetingg, and homework will help him in his &quot;normal&quot; account.

I have never said the &quot;normal&quot; account would be $5k, I said that many existing traders have started JVC with only $5k in their account because they had been struggling...and we wanted to help them. For your friend, I would allow a $10K start as long as he is proficient in Windows, Excel, and willing to work at this...basically pass our JVC Manager&apos;s interview.

Tell him ot get the paperwork started, study for the darn test, and report back to you in 6 months or so.

Regarding the guy who owes us money, he is paying it off.

And, yes, many who have made money in JVC have carried that over to the &quot;normal&quot; account...exactly as we hoped.

We don&apos;t ever concern ourselves with &quot;outside&quot; investors. We have made more money trading than with BT, but BT has never had a losing year of course. We keep as much money as need be in the Firm at all times.

Regarding &quot;hard pitch&quot; - we suggest that a training plan and boot camp is the best way to speed the learning curve up - the results are obviously better than with those who don&apos;t train at all.

&quot;Boot camps&quot; means they have joined the firm and are trading with us.

1. Week long school open to everyone.

2. Boot camp - 2-4 weeks of hands on live trading for members only.

Additional mentoring programs are available to those who want more interaction...but no one is ever left alone - everyone is online every second of the trading day with their direct manager/mentor/team etc., adds to their comfort level. I have 400 on my Yahoo messenger, LOL.

Look Mav, we are not for everyone,,,,and as you know, trading is not for everyone....and there are those who expect too much for too little effort - we do what we do, with the help of some of the best traders around...and so far, so good.

Another thing...we are not &quot;struggling&quot; as many are because of, not in spite of, our efforts in responding to what we see going forward. We stopped &quot;parking&quot; orders for rebates when we learned how awful HFT was, we instituted the JVC program when we saw so many that had been impacted by HFT and other market conditions. Are our revenues down, of course, but we have always been very cost effective - since we bought out our partner Eddie, no planes, no yachts around here - still driving my 2005 Dodge, Bob in his 10 year old car, LOL.

At some point I start to feel that I&apos;m being punished for being so open on here....I was reminded of my old friend Gene Weissman when one of our ET&apos;ers called about this thread, and about how Gene and I were the only ones who actually seemed to open up from a firm owner perspective (I know you&apos;ve always shared your expertise too). Sorry we lost Gene in a MC accident, but we were able to bring on his partner Leiberman on board at that time.

But, that being said, I enjoy what I do, and the 95% positives I get vs. the &quot;challenges&quot; seem to make it all worthwhile. And, as you noted, a chance to share with the public.

Heading out for Barona in San Diego, playing in a blackjack tournament, visiting some friends - but I&apos;ll check in later.

Don, from what I can tell the only thing that has changed with your business model is you take 20% of the profits. No change in deposit, no change in commissions, which are still higher than retail. Your JV program sounds interesting, but not a game changer.

Why would I, as a high volume profitable trader who doesn&apos;t trade pairs and am flat every night, want to join Bright vs just trading my capital at IB and getting lower commissions and 100% of the profits? It seems your only niche left is traders who either a) don&apos;t have much capital (and likely not much skill) or b) skilled traders carrying very large overnight positions that are willing to pay your haircut.

Rates in the .003 -.004 range aren&apos;t that high, however.

They are if you don&apos;t clear through GS.

And your rates aren&apos;t .003, they are .005 for anyone who trades algorithmically, ie. small shrs/ticket.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 
Commission rates for the &quot;free&quot; account start lower, and go to under our actual costs (as low as .002 at this point, perhaps to zero in the future).
Don 

Your actual cost is &gt; .002? I find it hard to believe but I know nothing about the GS clearing arrangement. Competitive high vol clearing ranges from .0004-.00005 (5 cents per 10000), don&apos;t see how/why you guys pat 5-40x the industry standard.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 You wouldn&apos;t want to join Bright - and I have sent many of my traders in your position to IB (they should be paying me for that, LOL).

Rates in the .003 -.004 range aren&apos;t that high, however.

Don 

This is an interesting stance. Shreddog is one of the best traders on ET. Most brokers would sell their firstborn to get his business, and your firm can&apos;t even offer him a worthy deal. I understand appealing to the constant stream of new traders, but having something in place for the really good traders out there would make sense too.

Don&apos;t misunderstand me or my premise here. Our top, multi-million dollar types, tend to keep larger positions overnight - not closed out each day. Thus a better fit for us. And, we&apos;d be glad to work with Mr. Shreddog - but I assume that he has a &quot;deal he can&apos;t refuse&quot; already...if not, I would be glad to chat. The thing is, as accountants, we know our &quot;actual&quot; costs (not just a differential between GS and traders) and having a &quot;loss leader&quot; only works at Walmart.

As far as long term traders, well over half have been with us for 8 years or longer - but, yes, we enjoy training new people as well. We prefer to retention to recruiting, but a combination of both has worked well for us.

As always, just reference this note when and if you and/or he want to chat.

All the best,

Don

I made a typo, said 5 cents per 10000, meant 5 cents per 10000, which is .00005 (quad 0 5). That&apos;s the low end, high end is .0004 for low vol small operation.
 Posted by CQNC on 08-06-10 06:01 PM: 
 

Clearing is through GS, then they&apos;re going through DirectEdge on monthly volume discounts in excess of 10M shares, so they&apos;re at a .0001 to .00015 cost level. Their gross margins are at least a cent, probably closer to two, so 100-200% on every share. I can&apos;t understand how they can&apos;t be profitable. It&apos;s just a matter of volume and frequency and risk management, and going in and out for a nickel, they&apos;re making money, don&apos;t let anyone try to fool you otherwise.
This says nothing of their hedging against positions. That alone is worth the price of admission.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Actually this is not completely true. Let me explain. In order to get this so called &quot;backed account&quot; you need to already fund a regular 25k account. So essentially you have 25k with the firm. Then Don creates a separate sub account for the JVC account or whatever he calls it. You have to fund your own account to get this sub account. And the account is only 10k. And if it loses 5k you are shut off. Don knows he is going to make that in commissions and haircut charges on your 25k account. I may be off on the exact details but this is the general idea.

 They are if you don&apos;t clear through GS.

And your rates aren&apos;t .003, they are .005 for anyone who trades algorithmically, ie. small shrs/ticket. 

Volume again - I was told you trade a lot (over 5 million = .003 for everything). Even over 1 million is .004 first 1,000, .003 over 1,000.

Observations of a n00b...

Is it just me, or does anyone else get the feeling that Maverick tortured small animals as a child? Watching him repeatedly poke and prod Don while Don squirms, quite frankly, uncomfortable. One also gets the feeling that Maverick started this whole thing with the kind of glee only reserved for 10 year olds tattling on their little brother...

As I&apos;ve mentioned in a previous post, I was in the process of Joining Bright, having signed up for the Setp class and studying for the 7 etc. At this point, however, I will not be joining under the new model. There is simply no way one can make it under these conditions.

As it was, I went over my trades for the past year or so, deducting 20% from all my winners. The results were devastating. Only something holy grail-ish could overcome such a rake.

I&apos;m sure that Don knows this, thus the JVC deal, but I don&apos;t think that will make up for it in the long run. And, FWIW, I think that Don has been very gracious in taking all the flak from Mav and others here.

At any rate, I guess I will look at other firms or just stay retail...

It wouldn&apos;t be 20% of only your winners. It would be 20% of your net profits for a month/week/year, whatever the terms of the agreement are with Bright.

Wouldn&apos;t most high volume guys (2M shares and up monthly) be much better off with an 80/20 split and 0.20/1000 commish anyway ?


Comparing 0.003/100% and 0.0002/80%

2M monthly volume : anything under 28k monthly profits and you&apos;re better off with 0.0002/80%.

4M monthly volume (let&apos;s mark it down to 0.002 for the 100% model): anything under 36k monthly profits and you&apos;re better off with 0.0002/80%.

6M monthly volume : the b/e point is over 52k.

You can imagine that as volume goes up, so does the breakeven point.
Most traders doing that kind of volume aren&apos;t over those b/e points.

So most (90%) traders doing over 1M volume per month are way better off with a 80% payout and 0.20/1000 model.

Ahaha that&apos;s funny, 20% off the each trade, what an accounting nightmare!

You guys are missing the point, this is about how the fundamental shifts in trading are affecting the viability of running a prop shop, the 20% spilt has nothing to do with it, there&apos;s lots of ways to work with that...and I don&apos;t see anything wrong with Mav prodding Don, as you put it, the tough questions need to be asked.....and there&apos;s a few things I was gonna say in comment to Don&apos;s post but held back.

one question no one asked is how can this sub account/jvc program be no risk and all profits?

Don seems to make it sound like they open a second account for you and out of the goodness of their heart they will trade your money, no risk of course and split the profits.


Does this sound about right? Just curious. There are no free lunches and this so called JVC program seems a bit sketchy especially when you hear the words &quot;no risk.&quot; There must be a rub somewhere.

So most (90%) traders doing over 1M volume per month are way better off with a 80% payout and 0.20/1000 model. 

Some problems with your analysis:
1) His commission has not changed with the 80/20 payout change. You pay the same at the new 80% payout as you did at 100%. There&apos;s no &quot;choice&quot; - you either take 80/20 at the old commission rate or leave it. Don has yet to correct me on this statement, so I must assume that&apos;s true.

2) Don&apos;s rates are .005 for the first 1000, .003 for the rest on any given ticket. A lot of high volume automated traders don&apos;t trade more than 1000 shrs/order and therefore would be paying .005 all the time.

3) Perhaps his rates are lower for higher volume traders, he says they are but he doesn&apos;t divulge his breakpoints. Regardless, high volume traders can get better rates and keep 100% of the profits retail as Don has already conceded.

No there is a 50 % profit split on the JVC account but you have no risk I believe for the first 10k or 5 k

Let&apos;s try this again. Trader has &quot;normal&quot; trading account. Trader may (about 170 have) open a second account with no downside risk. They run an automated program (let it run in the background)...do the homework, set parameters, listen in to mentoring meetings, work with my brother etc. - and keep half the profits. Commissions are automatically lower than standard, and every $10K made, you take out half....each time you take out $10K, your commish goes down. You can use all this help and mentoring to run the same program in your &quot;normal&quot; account too.

Seems to be well received and working. You must qualify, know computers, excel etc. - pass the JVC manager interviews that we put together.

Not a &quot;free lunch&quot; - no &quot;hangers on&quot; - you gotta do some work, but hey, it takes work to make money.

It is a traditional prop deal with 50-50 split. They have a stat arb group that is very profitable that trains these traders. What is sketchy about that?

How is it risk free? Do you have to maintain a certain balance? Why not just deposit 5k with you into the house account and you trade it and split the profits? Treat it like a CD and offer investors a guaranteed rate of return....

Say you have 20k in your regular trading account. Then assume you blow up in the JVC (50 - 50 split) account. Bright takes the loss not you. You do not lose any of your deposit.

It is a true prop. account. The only catch is that you need to be a member of the firm and use the stat arb strategy and automation that they use.

If the trader loses too much in the JVC account, they simply continue to trade their &quot;normal&quot; account - hopefully taking some fo the &quot;good stuff&quot; from their JVC trading to help make money.

It seems so simple to us, but as I am seeing from all the questions it may not be to everyone - so thanks everyone for asking the questions, hopefully more of you will take part.

 Bright Trading is going to have to give up the 100% payout model. All firms clearing Goldman have to. At most they can give the trader 80% of their profits. 


Why can&apos;t Bright tell Goldman to go screw themselves, anyway?

Either clear themselves or use somebody else?

Are you saying that Bright&apos;s business model is entirely dependent on Goldman&apos;s wishes?

I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m not clear on this but let me summarize my understanding. I open a bright account for 20k and elect to open a second account. Bright gives me 5k of risk capital to learn their automated strategies for openings and pairs. Therefore if I lose the 5k, it&apos;s bright&apos;s loss and I still have the 20k in my trading account?

Where did you get this 5k from? You have an account (of the firm&apos;s money) with a downside limit that if the account is hit, it&apos;s closed down (unless you choose to refund it on your own) but you&apos;re not on the hook for it. If you make 10k you get half, it resets at zero, different downside &apos;floors&apos; for traders depending on how many levels they hit....I hope you aren&apos;t cash coyne and you&apos;re playing dumb to facilitate more advertising for Don! 

I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this program gets whittled down to a select group of traders, call them micro hedge fund managers, that Bob puts more capital into...kinda a survival of the JVC fittest, so to speak....maybe i&apos;m just babbling 
 Posted by businessstaxes on 08-07-10 09:11 PM: 
 Re: Bright Trading&apos;s new payout model 

a definition of true prop firm or prop trader is trader doesn&apos;t risk or ask to deposit any money into the firms bank. every broker or hedge fund has a prop trading division. some brokers outsource their prop trading division which goldman is doing to avoid any investigation or accusation of trading against clients like frontrunning and market manipulation or using too much capital and ban on banks and brokers from using more than 3% of capital in trading their own accounts. they might as well shut it down cause they will be audited by regulators.

see how fast goldman sachs shuts down their prop trading division immediately after new finnancial regulation bill and shred and burn any evidence.

and now employees of these brokers or firms get paid like up to 1 million reward for reporting any security violations. rat system. before if you ratted on your company you get fired and blacklisted from the industry. why did you think none of the sub prime fraud was never reported.

these prop firms like don&apos;s were under the hedge fund or LLC model where the trader is a member of firm or LLC so not a traditional retail account.

only advantage to thise prop accounts is the 10:1 leverage intra-day and access to ECN.

 Quote from GGSAE: 

 Where did you get this 5k from? You have an account (of the firm&apos;s money) with a downside limit that if the account is hit, it&apos;s closed down (unless you choose to refund it on your own) but you&apos;re not on the hook for it. If you make 10k you get half, it resets at zero, different downside &apos;floors&apos; for traders depending on how many levels they hit....I hope you aren&apos;t cash coyne and you&apos;re playing dumb to facilitate more advertising for Don! 

I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this program gets whittled down to a select group of traders, call them micro hedge fund managers, that Bob puts more capital into...kinda a survival of the JVC fittest, so to speak....maybe i&apos;m just babbling 

ok. I have my account and sub account. I don&apos;t trade regular account and lose 5 to 10k in sub account. I then close out regular acct. How does this help bright?

I&apos;d rather tactically manage a portfolio of non correlated assets and achieve returns through asset allocation and a little leverage and have bright cover my margin on volitle days instead of being forced out of positions and having to take a loss.

Don toughts 30:1 leverage which is great but a 3 percent move wipes you out.

As maverick was saying key to success is equity.

On our blog and podcast this week, I discussed Goldman&apos;s reaction to Fin Reg and FINRA regulatory notice 10-18 calling for their prop trading firm customers to pay out prop traders 80% or less. I can&apos;t post links, so see our site.

This podcast is mostly on forex changes in Fin Reg. I will join this thread with other comments next week._

 Quote from NY0BScalper: 

 I have to say, I don&apos;t want to tie up more than $5-10k in capital if I can avoid it and still get full service. I opened up with a firm with $5k and turned the account into six figures... I knew how to trade, but if I didn&apos;t have the chance to trade with such a small amount, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to have been successful.

The attrition rate is horrible. But if you&apos;re a good trader you can take $5-10k and, with decent leverage, make $300-500/day until you build some bank up. Probably less than 3% of the guys who open at at these shops are actually capable of doing that, but it can still be done. 

With whom did you open? If you cannot post it here, could you PM me. Thanks.

 Quote from yobo: 

 I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m not clear on this but let me summarize my understanding. I open a bright account for 20k and elect to open a second account. Bright gives me 5k of risk capital to learn their automated strategies for openings and pairs. Therefore if I lose the 5k, it&apos;s bright&apos;s loss and I still have the 20k in my trading account? 

You nailed it with your scenario. I doubt they will answer . Maybe the 5K account would not be allowed until your other account has generated profits that might cover the total of $5K. I would also bet that if they see something not going as they judge, they step in and cancel/freeze the account. If you do not trade the 20K account, they can still make money if your capital is used in other trades. With a SPAN margin the 3% interest on cash they earn can generate 50% a year, which is $10K on a $20K account.

Here is another point. My alluding to the second account in the posts,people may call and dream of it as the end product/service. So they get more leads.

Okay are you retarded, I can&apos;t believe i&apos;m replying to this jibberish...the class B and JVC (call it A), are completely independent from eachother. Obviously bright wants to have the trader trade the B while in jvc so that they can earn income from commissions and haircuts, etc., but the point of the jvc (which also earns income through commissions and capital charges) is to facilitate the structure for traders that weren&apos;t making any money.
For traders that were, it&apos;s another style or &apos;profit centre&apos; for those willing to take the time and effort into doing it, but if they lose money or make money they can continue to trade their class B like they always have...So why does bright require a deposit? Well jesus christ if you allowed anybody into this program, there would be even less incentive to do well and the losses would really pile up. I hope that clears it and we can move on, this has been discussed ad nauseum.

Quite the opposite - we merely want to know if they qualify to learn the program, the automation, the homework and interaction required...just like any other partner in a business would do. We are allowing entry into our World of successful trading, and want this to be beneficial for everyone. They can keep all their &quot;normal&quot; trading in the other account.

You&apos;re trading a &quot;normal account&quot; - you then qualify for a zero downside risk account based on our what our top people are doing...those same people help you learn the program, you will the (hopefully) learn enough to both make money in JVC account, but use this training to make money in your &quot;normal&quot; account - which is already happening.

 Quote from Shreddog: 

 Some problems with your analysis:
1) His commission has not changed with the 80/20 payout change. You pay the same at the new 80% payout as you did at 100%. There&apos;s no &quot;choice&quot; - you either take 80/20 at the old commission rate or leave it. 


I was comparing a 100% payout / 2.00 or 3.00 per 1000 model to a 80% payout / 0.20 per 1000 model. Not Bright in particular. The trader has a choice between the two models (and perhaps additional models) by virtue of the choice of trading firm that he makes.

 2) Don&apos;s rates are .005 for the first 1000, .003 for the rest on any given ticket. A lot of high volume automated traders don&apos;t trade more than 1000 shrs/order and therefore would be paying .005 all the time. 

That makes it even worse for the 100% payout / higher commish model.

 Regardless, high volume traders can get better rates and keep 100% of the profits retail as Don has already conceded. 

That has to do with some of my analysis. I still think that 90% of these traders getting better rates with retail would still be much better off with a firm that offers 80% and 0.20/1000, as shown in the break-even point calculation.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Does it matter? GS determined the number. How does GS determine how much they want to ass rape their clients on OTC transactions? Maybe they just pull the number out of a hat every time a client calls for a quote on a 5 year 6% floating rate Brazilian bond denominated in Euros that converts into a MBS when long term rates hit 7% or when it starts raining in Chile whichever comes first.

So I guess I found another angle here. According to this link, from the first 10k made, 2k goes to the software developers. Then another 50% goes to Bob. I don&apos;t see anything wrong with this per se. You basically are looking for a way to monetize your software and give a kickback to the developers. I suspect before you were giving them some kind of cut on the commissions but with rates having to be lowered you needed to find a new way to pay them. Hence the JVC program.

 http://www.stocktrading.com/jvc.html 

&quot;When account reaches $10,000 positive, $2,000 will go to program developers, and the other will be split 50/50 between trader and Bob.&quot;

Do you expect the programmers to work for free?

The JVC program is really simple. There is a very successful stat arb group within Bright. Bob will back its traders who follow this strategy. You can only trade minimum size in the beginning limiting Brights risk. If you make money they will let you increase your size. If you don&apos;t you are shown the door.

I really don&apos;t understand why this is so hard for people believe.

I got started in this business with a similar arangement in 2000 except my commisions never went down while bright brings theirs down to cost incrementally.

I don&apos;t think anyone is confused by the JVC model Midas. The title of this thread has to do with Bright&apos;s new payout, not the JVC program. I only brought up the JVC program to discuss the viability of equity prop trading going forward.

My original comments still stand. I don&apos;t see how given the current operating margins that equity prop trading can continue in it&apos;s &quot;current&quot; form. Every time Don posts I get more and more bearish. He is not convincing me to cover.

 Re: Bright Trading&apos;s new payout model 

these prop trading thing is just for brokers like goldman sachs to get into the retail brokerage business without the retail brokerage regulations. these are not prop trading accounts. when you deposit cash into a prop firms accounts like these,,the broker or firm can use your cash to trade their own accounts.

goldman sachs, morgan stanley, bear stearns were all violating SEC and securities regulations for years but nobody seems to care since they wer makin so much money from their prop trading division.

The SEC and finra guys just turned a blind eye on their acitivities. like everybody turned a blind eye on the sub prime fraud activities. going on for years.

 Prop trading 

If you can afford the capital then prop trading with a direct access broker like Interactive Brokers should be ideal. If you can put up 100k then you enjoy a portfolio margin account which can give you close to 10:1 leverage for ETFs and close to 6:1 leverage for stocks. This is overnight leverage and intraday, it is the same for portfolio margin.

If you trade options to hedge your stock positions then you can get close to 40:1 leverage. Their margin rates are close to 1% as well. Check out this article from Barrons
 http://webreprints.djreprints.com/2417800443909.html 


Their commissions start at 1/2 penny per share but get as low as 1/10th penny per share along with passing the make/take fees to you so you could even rebate trade if your orders are adding liquidity.

No fee to open an account, no fee to close one, no fee to use their technology or platform, everything is free except for the commission cited above.

To open an account then just click this link:

Don, can I get some clarification here. Per this link:

 http://www.stocktrading.com/jvc.html 

It states that your normal haircut charges are 12%? That can&apos;t be right. Is this old?

&quot;Since account starts with a zero balance, there will be no haircut charges, only a 3% per annum capital charge for overnight positions (which is roughtly 1/4 &quot;normal&quot; haircut.&quot;

If your traders are using 10 to 1 leverage on overnights on the pairs they need to make 100% a year just to break even?

 Quote from sulli: 

 Probably because Echo clears with Merrill. GS is the one requiring the 80/20 payout. Just a guess? 
Per my podcast/blog on Aug 5, 2010.
Prop-trading update
Goldman Sachs told one of the largest prop-trading firms to change its payouts to prop traders to 80 percent or less, down from 100 percent. FINRA Regulatory Notice 10-18 said that 100 percent payouts were indicative of beneficial owners (disguised customer accounts and these firms are not registered customer-account broker dealers). Goldman seems to be closely following all rules now to stay out of trouble with the SEC. (Click here for the background on this issue see my blog archive June 22, 2010 FINRA&apos;s notice to prop traders.)

Note for EliteTrader:
I am guessing - and I know that is not good enough here - that other large broker dealers and their prop trading firm clients may follow Goldman and Bright Tradings move to 80% pay-outs. From what I have seen and heard to date, it seems that Goldman reacted to FINRA notice 10-18 and asked Bright to make this change. But, I have not confirmed this with Goldman.

Goldman seems to be cleaning house now to get ahead of the regulatory-curve, to be a good corporate-citizen with the SEC and other regulatory bodies too. Goldman settled their recent large SEC lawsuit and later announced they are spinning-off their prop trading unit to comply earlier then scheduled with the Dodd-Frank bills Volcker rule.

While other brokers and banks may delay complying with the Volcker rule for many years, Goldman was probably scared into complying early to avoid further regulatory trouble.

Bank of America and their bailout-acquisition Merrill Lynch were smack in the middle of controversy and it seems unlikely they can drag their feet on regulatory alerts like FINRA 10-18. BoA Merrill may follow Goldmans suit on prop trading firms and other issues - to avoid Goldmans lawsuits.

Goldman, JPM, Merrill, BoA, and the other Broker Dealers cause Trillions of loss of dollars to the nation / taxpayers through their Fraud and Felonious actions (and yet don&apos;t even have to be prosecuted for it) and Prop firms HAD nothing to do with what these Broker Dealers did when they executed all their scams yet Prop Firms may become extinct or at least have to morph into something new because of it...

sheeeshh... What a croc... 

Someday these Broker Dealers and their admin heads are going to get exactly what they deserve... some place some time... Lehman and Bear Sterns got theirs... the rest someday soon going with you someday soon...

These rates have been posted many times.

6 times equity overnight = Zero haircut
6-10 times = 2% per year (thus, less than 1% per year net.)


10-15 times = 4% peryear scaling up - individualized by trader.

Thus (don&apos;t you just love the word &quot;thus&quot; LOL) - since trader has zero money up, he/she only pays 3% per year to use the funds, pretty good. And, as each $10,000 goal is reached the commissions go down...another incentive for JVC.

And, yes, for those who go above 30 times or so (as a deterrant for cash accounts) could pay 1% per month for a couple of days).

$15,000 account using $150,000 would be 10% per year to stay at $15,000, right? 100% on using $150,000 would be $150,000 which is what we&apos;re looking for.

Don 

I know you&apos;ve gone over this a few times but when you said 1/4 your normal haircut charges that implies 12% annual interest. I see that is only on 30 to 1 leverage. Can you double check my math on this.

If someone has a 20k account and you give them 600k in leverage (30 to 1) at 12% interest, that&apos;s about 600k a year in interest charges right? Assuming they held that amount of capital every night for a year. And that means they need to make 3000% a year to break even on their trading? I think my math is off somewhere so can you walk me through it.

Now on the 15 times leverage for 4%, say you have a 20k account which would give you 300k in capital. At 4% interest, you would need to earn 60% on your trading to breakeven right?

I think Mav is doing/trying one helluva sandbagging job on DB for some reason, probably to draw in more traders to his biz, or has some motive for tearing DB apart here, because any moron can figure out what DB is explaining is not that complicated, the math is correct, if not fair. Everyone pays the standard overnight rate on capital, everyone pays the money market rate, everyone pays the margin rates near prime. Any idiot can do the math on what it&apos;s costing and what their break-even points are.

DB isn&apos;t wrong on this one. You&apos;re trading with his capital, you&apos;re paying him for the privilege, and you better be profitable or go trade for Mav instead where I&apos;m sure his deal is much better.

DB probably has a lot of money and time invested with accountants and lawyers that I am sure are (including myself) better-qualified to advise him as to the best path and structure for his business than Mav (despite his ego fooling him otherwise, I&apos;m sure) and most of the membership of ET.

Considering the rules of the game are changing for everyone, Mav should probably STFU and worry about his own business instead of everyone else&apos;s.

And no, that&apos;s not me sticking up for DB, DB can handle himself. This is me telling Mav to stop talking shit and start backing it up or MHOB. It&apos;s getting tiring reading his updates, as I&apos;m sure is everyone else.

DB probably has a lot of money and time invested with accountants and lawyers that I am sure are (including myself) better-qualified to advise him as to the best path and structure for his business than Mav (despite his ego fooling him otherwise, I&apos;m sure) and most of the membership of ET.

Considering the rules of the game are changing for everyone, Mav should probably STFU and worry about his own business instead of everyone else&apos;s.

And no, that&apos;s not me sticking up for DB, DB can handle himself. This is me telling Mav to stop talking shit and start backing it up or MHOB. It&apos;s getting tiring reading his updates, as I&apos;m sure is everyone else. 

Chill out guy. No one is sandbagging Don here. My questions are valid and most of them deal with the prop industry as a whole, not just Bright Trading. I have a buddy that paid 1k to attend his training and is considering his firm. I&apos;m trying to clarify a few of the things I told him to correct them if I was wrong. I thought the questions would benefit other traders so I posted them on this thread vs asking Don in private. Don can handle himself just fine, he doesn&apos;t need you to come on here and act like ass on his behalf.

Bright Trading and my firm are not even competitors. We don&apos;t really cater to the ET community because of our capital requirements. We have totally different business models and Don knows this and this is specifically why he throws a bone out to my firm and speaks so highly of us.

Every question I&apos;ve brought up on this thread is completely valid and important to discuss. If you don&apos;t like this thread, why are you reading it? I just never understood the idea behind someone complaining about a thread they don&apos;t have to read.

So if you want to attack me, go ahead. I&apos;m going to keep it civil and act like an adult. You have a right to act how you want to so go right ahead.

 I think Mav is doing/trying one helluva sandbagging job on DB for some reason, probably to draw in more traders to his biz, or has some motive for tearing DB apart here, because any moron can figure out what DB is explaining is not that complicated, the math is correct, if not fair. Everyone pays the standard overnight rate on capital, everyone pays the money market rate, everyone pays the margin rates near prime. Any idiot can do the math on what it&apos;s costing and what their break-even points are.

Gotta agree with you. Not sure what he doesn&apos;t comprehend.

And when Don suggested they talk offline here was Mav&apos;s reply:

&quot;Don I&apos;ll chat with you when I have some downtime. Really busy with a lot of stuff though.&quot;

Busy being obsessed with this thread perhaps. LOL.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Can you double check my math on this.

If someone has a 20k account and you give them 600k in leverage (30 to 1) at 12% interest, that&apos;s about 600k a year in interest charges right? you would need to earn 60% on your trading to breakeven right? 


$600K x 12% = $72K per year not $600K

But actually even less since. Once again...

6 times = zero so $120K = zero.
6-10 = 2% next $80k = $1600 total per year.
10-15 = 4% etc. Scaling up. $100K = $4k for a total of $5,600 per year on 15 times equity. And, that&apos;s where we start to slow people down, but some do use 30 or more IF they&apos;re making money with it.

To the others - I don&apos;t even know what John offers his people so I don&apos;t know for sure even if he is trying to &quot;make a better deal&quot; or not - ok if he is, I just don&apos;t know.

To all the PM&apos;s and emails - Thanks, I always appreciate the support - it goes a long way....and I&apos;ll get back to you when I get back in the office - give me a coujple of days to get caught up - and, I really don&apos;t think Mav is hassling me, and I&apos;m pretty sure his business model is much different.

Thanks Don. I had a typo in there. I guess the other guys didn&apos;t catch it. Not surprising. So in your example on a 20k account, the trader would have to make about 25% a year to breakeven.

I guess these guys don&apos;t realize that every firm actually calculates their haircut differently. Haircut by the way is different then credit and debit interest. A lot of guys don&apos;t understand that either. No two firms calculate their capital charges the same way.

Don I take it then most your traders actually use less then 15 to 1 leverage then? You always throw out the phrase &quot;use millions of our capital&quot; with 20k accounts. I must have misunderstood that. My bad.

Many do for the openings, &quot;a good chunk&quot; do during the day with their basket programs - a &quot;few&quot; do overnight - but most are pretty smart guys who understand risk reward, and keep things in the reasonable zone. We know that &quot;cowboys&quot; don&apos;t generally last too long, LOL. The capital is there if they &quot;earn&quot; the right to use it, understand the costs and the risk reward etc.

I think we can put all this to rest now...we have been really fortunate by having good traders and working with them and the newer people to get better. No &quot;blue sky&quot; from me, it&apos;s tough, and takes work to do well in this business - regardless of all the details.

Gotta catch a car back to the San Diego airport - didn&apos;t make the finals in the tournament (free JVC, LOL), but made pretty good money in my &quot;normal&quot; playing. LOL.

I personally have enjoyed Mav&apos;s posts. Don is very experienced both in the industry and with words, so it takes someone of equal stature to really get a good discussion going. With all the Bright fanboy&apos;s and determined haters on ET, this civil discussion has shed some light on information that all prospective and current traders should be happy is out in the open! Thanks to both of you!

28% on the 20k deposit yes but...

1.87% on the 300k leveraged amount for the year.

If the initial deposit were 50k it would require 0% for the same leveraged amount.

Just thinking aloud here.

OK, I will. I don&apos;t think my calling you out makes me childish. I think that&apos;s what you&apos;re claiming to do to DB, isn&apos;t it? Quid Pro Quo.

THIS is why you&apos;re sandbagging DB. The truth comes out in the strangest ways.

Sorry, I don&apos;t buy your explanation. You&apos;re full of shit. You know all this, you claim to be (one of) the most experience, knowleg...blah. blah, blah...traders here, so DB&apos;s model should not concern you.

If your &quot;buddy&quot; had a problem with DB, it&apos;s probably because he couldn&apos;t make the cut, and he isn&apos;t smart enough to work through it himself so he has you doing his dirty work.

I can read and reply to any post you or anyone else can, I don&apos;t need your permission or endorsement, and I don&apos;t have to agree with your or DB or anyone else, and neither do you I.

I&apos;m taking The First on this one, so until you post something intelligent concerning DB&apos;s model, yeah, I&apos;m pretty much ignorning it, as should most of us on ET. DB&apos;s wasted enough of his time explaining how it works here. Most of us figured it out 30 pages ago...

I would only look at the expense as it relates to my capital. This is important because a trader has to determine if his strategy is robust enough to overcome the vig.

I&apos;m not sure what you meant by the 50k deposit requiring 0%. It doesn&apos;t matter what the numerator is in terms of vig.

Alright guy. Looks like it&apos;s time for you to hit the unsubscribe button. You are getting way too worked up over this. It&apos;s a message board....relax. LOL.


And for the record, I know very little about Don&apos;s model as it has changed dramatically since I last spoke to Don in person. Obviously this new 80/20 rule just came out and it is affecting all firms differently. And again, I&apos;m not sandbagging Don. Although I think Don owes you a beer.

On the 50k account, to get the same 300k i.e. 6 times, the vig is zero according to what Don has written.

True but the 50k account would probably get 750k in leverage or 15 to 1. Look all prop firms get extended 6.6 to 1 leverage via the JBO. It doesn&apos;t cost the firm anything that is why there is no charge for that amount. Anything over 6.6 to 1 eats into firm capital so the firm has to decide what they are going to charge for use of that capital.

Most traders, not all, most most, will use the max leverage that they can especially if they are trading pairs where they are hedged dollar neutral.

Don doesn&apos;t owe me anything, only reason I can think of you saying that is you&apos;ve got a jealousy thing going here because he&apos;s getting valuable PR for his company, and you&apos;re not, which IMHO, is brilliant business smarts on his part. Why not use ET as a promotional tool, especially when you&apos;re paying the owners ad money to draw in business. Are you paying ET for your posts?

Kudos to DB for putting up with you this long. It&apos;s not easy cursing someone through a smile. I know I can&apos;t.

Good thread. I have read the material on the VTrader site on Haircuts, and that was helpful also. Obviously if the charge gets to the point of being loan shark like then it really isn&apos;t worth it, but each trader should be responsible for finding out how it works and what their costs would be based on their strategy. I maybe wrong, but I think both Mav and his firm, and the Brights would make sure a new &quot;hire&quot; understands the cost of trying to go to the max, or most likely wouldn&apos;t let them in the first place until they proved their strategy. Everyone needs to have an idea of cost of capital and how it affects your return. The other side of the equation, to me, is being able to expand your trading to strategies that need much larger capital than a retail firm can do, even IB. If I want to participate in opening orders in a meaningful way it seems I would need a fairly large base on my own, but have it if I am with a firm. The same applies to closings, or pairs. Try going to a bank and explaining this stuff and getting short term loans to cover yourself for trading. While I have thought about it; as I have a fairly detailed trading plan, I really have no need to have them call the county mental institution and haul me out of the bank, and have the story on the local news. While my wife would actually just laugh, it probably would really tick my Dad off and at 88 years old I&apos;ve given him enough frustrations and annoyances in life.
That being said I still haven&apos;t done my Series 7 studying, and for the majority am still a emini, and EC daytrader. Any thoughts from Mav or Don whether I need to buy new Series 7 material in light of regulatory changes? Mine is 2-3 years old now. I took a sample test when I got it and scored in the 60&apos;s before having read a thing. I admit I don&apos;t know my bonds material as well as I had in school decades ago. It seemed like regualtory was a good part, but you could pass without being perfectly up to date.
 Posted by CQNC on 08-10-10 08:43 PM: 
 

LOL.

I did just that with all the major Canadian banks, and they all five offered me the maximum loan I could qualify for based on my balance sheets and income statements and projections. It took some explaining, the local bank managers were complete imbeciles, I ended up negotiating with VPs that knew and were willing to admit their banks were making more money from trading than anything else, but to get it done is like pulling teeth from a tiger or trying to teach a cat to sit. Morons, all of them.

Now it&apos;s just a matter of hedging my own ownership risk if I CBSX myself, or I take the cash and dump it into nice safe Canadian bonds and leverage it close to retail within my own CM accounts for a year until I pay it off in full.

It sucks having to sign over one&apos;s house to get loans these days, but when you&apos;re making 200% on your money from trading year over year, I can live with the litigation risk if I were to blow out.

Great post. Made my day.

Tac, your 7 has to be renewed through continued ed every 2 years. If you fail to do that, it will lapse. Firms who use the CBOE as their SRO do not require a 7.

Yes, you are right, traders need to understand all costs before they start trading but I can tell you right now that most guys do not understand capital charges and how it affects their trading. Most guys don&apos;t even know how to calculate their debit interest.

Bright actually does their calculations very different then most firms, hence why I brought it up. It&apos;s not better or worse, just different.

This stems from FINRA, so it&apos;s reasonable to assume GS won&apos;t be the only clearing firm affected.

 Re: Bright Trading&apos;s new payout model 

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 I&apos;m curious why Don has not commented yet on Bright Trading moving to an 80% payout model. Not by his choice, but Goldman&apos;s. 

I&apos;m not american, but will this new model have any implications for new/other taxes to the IRS? Self employment tax etc?
 Posted by Sun Light on 08-11-10 06:58 AM: 
 

Maverick, Don

Thank you for this thread. And thanks to Don for replying. I am (or should I say, I Was?) in the process on joining BT, but what i have learned from this thread and new 80-20 development that did put some doubts in my mind.
This is how i compared BT with my IB account. Points that I considered in favor of BT, assuming the previous 100% model are as follows.

1. DB charges about $235 per month (that includes NY/NASDAQ exchange charges, GS software charges etc). This money does not go to BT directly, but goes to exchanges as professional membership fees etc. If you are Just retail trader(IB), you don&apos;t have to pay this fees.
These charges (or about $200) can be waived if you generate enough volume per month. I do not have exact number.
I looked at it like cost of doing business. about $2500 per year. It is worth trying for at least a year.
There is no point in taking trades, generating volumes for the sake of it so that one can save $200 per month on commission rebate.
At least not for the new ones starting with them.

2. It seems, you can get &quot;streaming quotes&quot; from the software (Redi plus?) for about 800-1000 tickers. Note that IB gives only 100.
to get that 1000 streaming quotes, one may have to pay about $120 per month from other service providers.
You can use streaming quotes to hook up with Excel and generate alerts based on strategies etc. And I have process/programs in place for that.

3. DB provides a audio conference call daily. Teamspeak, I think. They have at least few hundred traders and lot of them are experienced.
You get to interact with experienced traders. You can develop peer relations. the forum/conference can alert fellow traders on some stock that is moving. Traders Collaboration. Though I have a account with IB, it does not provide me that kind of forum. IB&apos;s traders chat sucks. This type of traders collaboration is in itself a great value for those who consider it. I think such service with (audio conference moderator) is available for about $100 per month for a good program. The loneliness of a full time retail trader and the need to connect with same species can be understood by only those who gone through it.

4. DB provided 100% payout earlier. (no longer I think. Though I read this forum frequently, I am yet to see words from Don that says &quot;our Normal account pay out is 80/20 now, which was 100% earlier&quot;)

5. The capital use of firm. This point is less important for me or a new trader. Capital/leverage is two edged sword.
No point in using all that leverage that Don gives in initial years of trading.

6. The JVC program is 2nd account. Not the primary account. You can not have it without primary account. for simple reasons, i can not understand what is there that an able trader can do in 2nd account that he can not do in 1st account. If it is program driven pair, trader can generate pair trades using his own or third party program and trade it in 1st account and keep more than 50% profit. The benefit BT giving is Zero risk up to $5000 and I guess that is only one time. Once you loose $5000 your 2nd account is closed. I look at like $5000 sign on bonus. The primary account is what I have to trade to make my living. The &quot;Normal&quot; account is the only what I considered. With 100% payout it was still a sweet deal.

7. The commissions is again not too bad compare to IB. (0.007) I am not talking about high volume though.

8. Honesty. Reputation. I think Brights are there in market for years and even the strong critics also will hesitate to blame them on this front. If you want to stop trading with them, they will return your money. That is not the case with ease with so many other props.

9. You can still keep IB and trade a good volume there, if you are concerned about commission.

All in all, with earlier 100% payout, for a cost of doing business of $2500/year one will get good streaming quotes, opportunity to interact and stay connected with other good traders. It was worth a try. In a year or so, one will know if he can make that volume trades that will rebate his commission of $200per month back. Also if one can learn enough to use BT&apos;s capital/leverage. Basically to know if you are cut out as a professional trader. If yes then it all makes sense, otherwise still trying it for a year is worth.

But now if it is 80-20 then all bets are OFF. I mean really, in the first year if i am not big on the capital advantage or the JVC program is there still a point? The only advantage that i see here is my 3rd point i.e. Team interaction/peer support/ management support. I have to weigh that with all the odds to see if it still make sense.

That being said, I think the struggle is between the Big boys who can do HFT and all that, and the small guys likes us who used to seek shelter under the leadership like brights. I am with BT and other good firms here. They let us come together and do things as a team. But With this 80-20 rule, the Big boys have just hit back big time. It will test the zeal of prop trading as business. Unless BT shows me more &quot;value&quot; than what I see, joining them is pointless, I think.

One solution that I can think of is BT funding 20% capital and trader provides 80%. I am not talking about leverage, pure capital in the primary account. then 80-20 makes sense. In this case BT is willing to share 20% loss and entitled for 20% profit. BT should &quot;let it go&quot; i.e 20% loss if i closed my account with them when the loss is still outstanding. If i made 30% loss, I will pay 10% back even if I close the account.

Off course to trust a new trader with 20% of firms capital, they have to screen a trader well or should have to establish a process to qualify such traders. trading experience, Programming experience, understanding of Risk reward etc. These restrictions could come in the play. And the last thing I want to see is increase in &quot;Training fees&quot; to provide that 20% contribution as firms capital.

I am still supporter of BT even if it does not works out for me in coming weeks. I am not exactly a believer in &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; per se, but now I know what George Carlin meant when he said...&quot;what can you do? They got you by the balls...&quot;

Just a clarification. The &quot;second acount&quot; JVC is zero downside risk, and is a $10,000 &quot;credit line&quot; so to speak. You can run this automatically, in conjunction with your normal account. If qualifed, this acts as a training/grouping type of thing for about 150 or more of our traders - share ideas, share technology - and sure, you can use all those ideas in your &quot;normal&quot; account as well... that was the initial hope...that traders would both augment their income ...and add new ideas to their &quot;normal&quot; account.

All the best,

Don

Sun Light,

I agree with your post.

My understanding from looking at their model is if you&apos;re doing lower voume (less than 200k/shares), which is 10,000 shares per day on average, your FIXED COST is around $6,000/annually ($250/month professional fees plus $245/month desk fees).

If you&apos;re depositing 20k with the firm, and if you&apos;re not doing the 10k/shares/day average, then you will incur a drawdown of 30% annually just in fees! Of course, this is simply a cost of doing business and is not an issue for experienced traders who can benefit from the added use of capital.

Like I posted earlier, the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of trading with this new payout model has to be evaluated, and that will vary depending on what other firms can offer in terms of upfront costs, monthly fixed fees, access to capital, platforms, and commissions per share.

The questions any new trader looking into doing business with Bright should ask are as follows:

1. How will I structure a trading plan to leverage the capital and minimize the drawdowns? There are plenty of postings here about &quot;using a million or so&quot; and &quot;holding 6x overnight.&quot; But who in their right minds holds 6x overnight in THIS market! So, you&apos;re willing to wake up tomorrow with a 2% gap down on the Spiders while holding some long S&amp;P;equity positions, even if it&apos;s hedged? Overnight margin is the eventual killer of all traders. Retail allows you to use 2x overnight, and even that can give you heart palpitations in a choppy market, lol!

2. Even if you leverage the capital on your 20k while daytrading, like Sun Light posted, it&apos;s a double-edge sword. Would you really build a 20k share position in a highly liquid stock such as BAC/INTC, and withstand even a ten cent drawdown? That puts you out 2k, or 10% of your initial deposit, in just ONE trading day. Sure, it works great when it goes in your favor, however I don&apos;t see it as being a wise use of the capital. And if you&apos;re NOT building size, then why the hassle of getting a ser 7, and paying higher fixed costs and commissions? Perhaps the firm is best suited for those who do basket trading at the open, pairs trading, or are familiar with witing algo trades in the jvc sub-account.

3. The connections made with other traders does have a huge benefit, and perhaps that alone is worth the extra fees, but you really have to think long and hard before giving up your 20% when you are putting up ALL the risk and paying higher fixed costs, especially if you are holding positions overnight.

Bright has a well capitalized structure (just pull up the focus report from the SEC site and you&apos;ll see), and solid reputation in the industry. Perhaps he would consider adopting a CBSX model, or even swtiching clearing firms that does not mandate this new payout? There are many traders who are in search of a well capitalized firm given all the shady deals and firms who are highly levered, and it would seem very plausible to go this route.

Just for clarification.

Annual exchange fee = $500

$200 per month desk fee covers NYSE etc. But is fully rebated at the 200K month share level.

So, even if you did have to pay the monthly fee it&apos;s only $2900 - and most will get the $200 back anyway.

Don

And, we&apos;re still working on various ways of working all this out with our traders....

I agree with Sun Light, it&apos;s hard enough making money trading as it is, having to overcome a 20% handicap will be nigh impossible.

I&apos;m still not really clear on when/how the 20% is calculated...

Perhaps Don could shed some light on this?

As to the advantage of the live chat with all of the traders: sorry, but I really don&apos;t see that. My logic is as follows:

Most traders lose money, so why would I want to expose myself to a room full of people who are losing money on average? There are probably a few good ones out of the multitudes...as with everything else.

Better, in the words of Livermore, to play a &quot;lone hand.&quot;

As for me, I&apos;ll be canceling my registration for the sept class. I think Bright is probably the best out there, so don&apos;t get me wrong, but the model is broken. FINRA has just done everything possible over the past several years to make trading profitably as difficult as can be.

Many don&apos;t bother with the JVC plan, many think of it as &quot;easy money&quot; - Nothing to stop them from actually &quot;double dipping&quot; - making money in both accounts - spread out the risk, etc.

(Unless I am misunderstanding your question).

Let me try to understand this 80/20 better.
We are talking about the 1st account only. Lets leave JVC out of it for now.
If I deposit 20k with BT .
Scene 1: 1st month, I made 10K profit. Does BT get to keep 2K profit? (immediately or eventually)?
Scene 2: 1st month, If I make a loss of 10K. Does BT absorb 2K loss?
What is it? 100% traders capital, Zero % BTs loss or 20% BTs profit?
Then it should be called 80-0-20. Yeah...I still think... &quot;they got you by the balls&quot;

In a lot of strategies I have observed that profitable entry points can be quite crowded, and become more crowded as more and more traders and capital are committed to the strategy. I know there are a million pair combinations you can come up with, but with fills the way they are, I wondered if a group of innovators could be cannibalizing themselves.

It&apos;s not really taking the best strategies, all that&apos;s going on is using some of the software tools to people that may not have had access to them before. There&apos;s more communication, yes, but for a lot of the experienced traders they already had their own groups/colleagues they were in contact with.

And I definitely agree with you on the second point...I&apos;ve been trading a pair with a low ATR over a period of 2 years i&apos;ve had about a 90% success rate (winners/losers). Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing, just hitting a lot of singles...the irony is the typical &apos;screening stats&apos; most guys flock too wouldn&apos;t pull this pair up in a result so it doesn&apos;t look that good until you start trading it. The liquidity is there, but there have been times premkt i&apos;ve taken amazing anomalies that if others trade it would be lost opportunities for me....sorry for getting on a rant but there&apos;s one more point I want to make.

I don&apos;t think I agree with the whole, let&apos;s put everyone in a room together and brainstorm/call out trades. There&apos;s clearly different types of traders where hearing other positions trades can affect your plan and this also creates dependency which hinders creative learning.

 Quote from Midas:

Exactly, and after the gold is all gone.

As Szeven pointed out, any otherwise profitable strategy will lose it&apos;s effectiveness and become worthless when too many traders begin trading the same methods. Unfortunately, Bright&apos;s business model ensures that their traders have to continually find new trading strategies as the old ones constantly fail due to over use. This happened to OPG trading in the past few years, and you now rarely hear a word about that strategy (and Don&apos;s OPG thread is dead as essentially is the strategy). The same is now true for pair trading, as this strategy seems to be in the final stages of a death spiral as well.

A profitable trader should think long and hard before trading at Bright with a new innovative and consistently profitable method (I would never, ever do it). Why? You will be quickly identified as a very good trader, and your trades will be evaluated to see if they can figure out how you are trading. Before long, your methods will be taught to &apos;bootcampers&apos; and your successful edge will eventually be diluted to the point of it&apos;s demise. I know of a trader that had this exact experience. (the only winner will be the broker, that benefits from the additional flow of bootcamp training fees and subsequent commissions generated)

On the positive side, few traders should see any adverse effect from the new 80/20 profit split, as I doubt a large percentage of the traders there have net profits in their accounts. Instead, they slowly bleed their accounts and will never pay a 20% share of their net profits. While this is good news for the losing traders (no additional &apos;fee&apos; from the profit split), it is also bad news that they are destined to lose money in their trading. Hard to spin a good marketing angle from this &apos;good news&apos;, though.

I agree with you to some extent Eric but for the most part it&apos;s not that simple. For the first few months of 2008 I was in a group of remote traders (between 5-10) where my results were far and above everyone else&apos;s - I didn&apos;t know this at the time until several months later. The head trader could see all my positions and my trades; the group was using the same tools/information but my results were far and above everyone else&apos;s. I remember he kept asking what I was doing, i&apos;m like fuck can&apos;t you see? And i&apos;m telling you guys exactly what i&apos;m doing...I&apos;m not trying to brag but time and again i&apos;ve seen multiple traders trade the same pair sitting side/side with entirely different results...

Contrary to the prevailing sentiment here, Bright is working hard to making those that aren&apos;t making money, profitable.

 Quote from Sun Light: 

 Maverick, Don

Thank you for this thread. And thanks to Don for replying. I am (or should I say, I Was?) in the process on joining BT, but what i have learned from this thread and new 80-20 development that did put some doubts in my mind.
This is how i compared BT with my IB account. Points that I considered in favor of BT, assuming the previous 100% model are as follows.

1. DB charges about $235 per month (that includes NY/NASDAQ exchange charges, GS software charges etc). This money does not go to BT directly, but goes to exchanges as professional membership fees etc. If you are Just retail trader(IB), you don&apos;t have to pay this fees.
These charges (or about $200) can be waived if you generate enough volume per month. I do not have exact number.
I looked at it like cost of doing business. about $2500 per year. It is worth trying for at least a year.
There is no point in taking trades, generating volumes for the sake of it so that one can save $200 per month on commission rebate.
At least not for the new ones starting with them.

2. It seems, you can get &quot;streaming quotes&quot; from the software (Redi plus?) for about 800-1000 tickers. Note that IB gives only 100.
to get that 1000 streaming quotes, one may have to pay about $120 per month from other service providers.
You can use streaming quotes to hook up with Excel and generate alerts based on strategies etc. And I have process/programs in place for that.

3. DB provides a audio conference call daily. Teamspeak, I think. They have at least few hundred traders and lot of them are experienced.
You get to interact with experienced traders. You can develop peer relations. the forum/conference can alert fellow traders on some stock that is moving. Traders Collaboration. Though I have a account with IB, it does not provide me that kind of forum. IB&apos;s traders chat sucks. This type of traders collaboration is in itself a great value for those who consider it. I think such service with (audio conference moderator) is available for about $100 per month for a good program. The loneliness of a full time retail trader and the need to connect with same species can be understood by only those who gone through it.

4. DB provided 100% payout earlier. (no longer I think. Though I read this forum frequently, I am yet to see words from Don that says &quot;our Normal account pay out is 80/20 now, which was 100% earlier&quot;)

5. The capital use of firm. This point is less important for me or a new trader. Capital/leverage is two edged sword.
No point in using all that leverage that Don gives in initial years of trading.

6. The JVC program is 2nd account. Not the primary account. You can not have it without primary account. for simple reasons, i can not understand what is there that an able trader can do in 2nd account that he can not do in 1st account. If it is program driven pair, trader can generate pair trades using his own or third party program and trade it in 1st account and keep more than 50% profit. The benefit BT giving is Zero risk up to $5000 and I guess that is only one time. Once you loose $5000 your 2nd account is closed. I look at like $5000 sign on bonus. The primary account is what I have to trade to make my living. The &quot;Normal&quot; account is the only what I considered. With 100% payout it was still a sweet deal.

7. The commissions is again not too bad compare to IB. (0.007) I am not talking about high volume though.

8. Honesty. Reputation. I think Brights are there in market for years and even the strong critics also will hesitate to blame them on this front. If you want to stop trading with them, they will return your money. That is not the case with ease with so many other props.

9. You can still keep IB and trade a good volume there, if you are concerned about commission.

All in all, with earlier 100% payout, for a cost of doing business of $2500/year one will get good streaming quotes, opportunity to interact and stay connected with other good traders. It was worth a try. In a year or so, one will know if he can make that volume trades that will rebate his commission of $200per month back. Also if one can learn enough to use BT&apos;s capital/leverage. Basically to know if you are cut out as a professional trader. If yes then it all makes sense, otherwise still trying it for a year is worth.

But now if it is 80-20 then all bets are OFF. I mean really, in the first year if i am not big on the capital advantage or the JVC program is there still a point? The only advantage that i see here is my 3rd point i.e. Team interaction/peer support/ management support. I have to weigh that with all the odds to see if it still make sense.

Did you include the cost for eSignal or other charting and data feed service at about $200 a month... so it would be an extra $2400... unless i missed it in your writeup... 

also add on Exchange fee each year around $400 to $500 dollars...

EricP,

I moved to Bright over 3 1/2 years ago with a very profitable strategy. My trading is kept very close to the hip and they respect that. The people who train and share do so as entrepreneurs . They approach Bob and Don with a business proposition and profit from teaching what they know.

Pairs trading is not a secret, and a few 100 traders at a prop. firm are not going to kill the edge. Everyone comes out ahead in my opininion. Rob and the PairCo guys get to sell their picks and shovels, the Bright&apos;s retention rate stays high (due to the fact you need millions to throw around any real size, and pairs make probability based trading easier), the traders learn a good strategy.

On the other hand the new payout shoved down our throat by FINRA is a game changer.

Yeah EdgeHunter, I discounted that. Not esignal&apos;s $200, but more like IQfeed $120 or so for 1000 streaming quotes. They are not as top as esignal, but good value for money. Also My comparison is between IB(retail) and BT(prop). with retail IB, you don&apos;t need to pay exchange fees.

Over all I think BT is great deal before 80-20.
Also I am sure Don will find a way out of it. If you don&apos;t take care of your customers, somebody else will. I think this is the best thread to suggest Don what the new wanna be traders think. I mean considering the present 80-20 catch, and assuming that it is going to be there no matter where BT goes (GS or merril etc..) for clearing. I am sure there are more than me here sitting on the fence. They have to find creative solution that can keep BT in business as well traders interested with value proposition , keeping the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; low for the first year and so on.

 Quote from Sun Light: 

 Let me try to understand this 80/20 better.
We are talking about the 1st account only. Lets leave JVC out of it for now.
If I deposit 20k with BT .
Scene 1: 1st month, I made 10K profit. Does BT get to keep 2K profit? (immediately or eventually)?
Scene 2: 1st month, If I make a loss of 10K. Does BT absorb 2K loss?
What is it? 100% traders capital, Zero % BTs loss or 20% BTs profit?
Then it should be called 80-0-20. Yeah...I still think... &quot;they got you by the balls&quot; 

This is the best question that has not been answered yet. When does the 20% come out? If it&apos;s at the end of the year, that is much better then if it&apos;s on a month to month basis.

And I&apos;m pretty sure Bright will not share in the losses.

thanks... Sun Light... DTN $120 is for Retail Trader Costs once you are a Series 7 Trader you have to pay professional rates at $130 a month alone for NYSE data... +100 a month for DTN platforms... and then the other exchanges on top of that...so it still comes to about $2400 more a year...

 Quote from risktaker: 

 How come EchoTrade/Merrill aren&apos;t on a 80/20 split? 

If I am not wrong, 80-20 is GS thing. BT uses GS for clearing. Looking at what changes the industry is going and the heat GS faced before coming out with 80-20 rule, I think other players (Merrill etc) will also follow it. it is just matter of time. Just a guess..

You can use EOD esignal for i think only 25/30 a month, and there&apos;s some okay free intraday charts out there (for those that aren&apos;t actively trading that much).

Yup end of year. If it was month by month I&apos;d probably shut my account down right now, lol! If it gets to the point only profitable traders r left....and for guys that don&apos;t make money get the boot.....well there&apos;s the new biz model!

As to the advantage of the live chat with all of the traders: sorry, but I really don&apos;t see that. My logic is as follows:
Most traders lose money, so why would I want to expose myself to a room full of people who are losing money on average? There are probably a few good ones out of the multitudes...as with everything else.
Better, in the words of Livermore, to play a &quot;lone hand.&quot; 
Most traders loose money, then is that is exactly what to be learn. i.e. what not to do! :-) Interaction with other traders still can be a win-win situation.No body will ask you to share your game plan.Ultimately Humans are social animal. We live in pack to survive. To stay connected with your species is a need. If you ignore it, it will affect psychology one or other way. Jesse is great, but we all can&apos;t be Jesse. But still we can be reasonably successful in trading.
Just an opinion. Individual perspective will be different. :-)

 Quote from Sun Light: 

 Let me try to understand this 80/20 better.
We are talking about the 1st account only. Lets leave JVC out of it for now.
If I deposit 20k with BT .
Scene 1: 1st month, I made 10K profit. Does BT get to keep 2K profit? (immediately or eventually)?
Scene 2: 1st month, If I make a loss of 10K. Does BT absorb 2K loss?
What is it? 100% traders capital, Zero % BTs loss or 20% BTs profit?
Then it should be called 80-0-20. Yeah...I still think... &quot;they got you by the balls&quot; 

Based on Don&apos;s comment that it&apos;s end of year, then your scenario would be as follows:

Scene 1: 1st month. If you made 10k, then you would have a liability to Bright for 2k, which could be added/deleted based on your following month&apos;s p&amp;l.;So Bright could also &quot;lose&quot; its cut of 20% if you lost any gains such that the end of year net was zero.

Scene 2: 1st month. If you make a LOSS of 10k, then my understanding of the model is that your capital contribution is simply reduced by 50% of your original 20k deposit, thus you have 10k left in your balance. No loss to Bright.

The question is: what happens if you want Bright to cut a check if you carry a net monthly gain, would they pay out 80% and book its own gains of 20% intrayear?

That was a good and legitimate question and it does not just pertain to Bright. It&apos;s a GS issue!!!!! I wanted to know if GS is directing the protocol in which these payouts have to be dispersed. That is a major issue. If the clearing firms are going to start dictating all the terms of the prop deals then the prop firms are going to have all sorts of problems going forward.

Enough with the sandbagging shit, it&apos;s getting old hat. There are some very legitimate issues here that I personally would like to know myself because as others have pointed out, this is going to affect Merrill and Penson soon enough. This will not stop with GS.

Another good question. I think what may end up happening is there could be a 12 month capital lockup. This is very common among true prop firms where one is being compensated for performance. In this situation prop firms usually pay the trader a draw on those future gains and then payout the performance at the end of the year. If you lose money then technically the firm is on the hook for the draw amount. I am guessing this is the only way that would work. So traders would have to leave their capital in the firm for 12 months unless they were closing the account or have the firm issue an advance on those profits through the draw. This creates another complication for those that need to pull money out from month to month although it&apos;s pretty easy to setup the draw structure.

No lockup of deposit. Draw profits once a week if you like as well.

Boy, you guys are really giving me good ideas on how to screw traders around, LOL.

If a trader withdraws 8,000, we take 2,000. etc. all year long. At year end, we add up that along with the overall P&amp;L;to be sure the split is correct.

We know how some firms recalculate each month, and think it borderlines criminal activity.

Just like your income taxes I guess, LOL. But, if you don&apos;t pull it out each month, then we just adjust at year end. I think the guys are worried about the monthly calculations, which we aren&apos;t doing.

What do you mean just like income tax? I don&apos;t pay taxes every month when I take profits out. What do you mean by monthly calculations? It seems like it&apos;s very straightforward. A guy makes 10k this month and takes it out, you take out 2k. Isn&apos;t that a monthly calculation? What are these criminal calculations that you refered to?

What many firms do with &quot;splits&quot; is say you make 10K in January, take out 2k, give you 8K. Then you lose 10K in Feb, and the trader eats all the losses etc. That&apos;s what I mean by calculations.

And, all of our traders are fine at this point. As I have said, we&apos;ll hopefully work all this out.

And, you should pay your quarterly taxes Mav, LOL. My point was aimed more at the people with a &quot;paycheck&quot; having withholding etc.

How do you guys do your split? Do you do it monthly or annually? Just curious.

Would it be easier if simply 20% of all profits made are simply blocked from being withdrawn so whether you withdraw monthly, weekly or completely randomly you always know how much is available for withdrawal and how much is blocked?

Question is, can you use those blocked funds (20% of accumulated profits) for other purposes before the end of the year when it is taken from your account?

[EDIT: Ignore this one, I missed the previous posts covering this point already]

Don 

If a trader makes 10k and gets 8k, gives 2k to the firm. Then next month trader loses 10k. It&apos;s the firm that eats the 10k Don, not the trader. I have friends that work at just about every prop firm here in Chicago and that is the standard model and it&apos;s not criminal. In fact, if anything, it&apos;s unfair to the firm. They take all the risk.

True, now the trader has a high water mark he has to get to in order to get paid out again, but it&apos;s the firm that is absorbing the risk, not the trader. Unless there is something I am not understanding here.

Our payout is taken end of year.

Edit: I&apos;m refering to a true prop model. Maybe that is where we diverge here. The trader has no risk in the example I am giving.

Currently, CBSX firm members do not require a series 7 license to trade, only the standard FBI background check and U4 filing.

SEC requires a one year lock-up on capital contributions, as many of the CBSX firms are highly levered. That&apos;s why firms can get traders started for much less of a capital contribution (around 5k) while still offering plenty of buying power, as the firm gets portfolio margin which they can allocate to their traders.

With all the regulatory changes/issues, who knows what will happen next!

propseeker:

Go to the SEC.gov site and pull up the .pdf of the most recent &quot;focus report&quot; under the search engine. You simply have to type in the name of the firm.

Here is the link for your convenience:

 http://sec.gov/search/search.htm 

If the firm doesn&apos;t have the latest focus report on the SEC site, then you can ask them for it directly. CBSX firms only require 100k in net capital as per SEC, a drop in the bucket for Bright, lol!

Thanks ScalperJoe.

Comparing Focus report, BT stands way way way above compare to others.
It is just matter of time when this 80-20 issue will start affecting other firms under FINRA. Not sure of the CBSX model. But why would they stay away from such regulation in the long run? Ultimately they are also answerable to somebody.
BTs and other props of the world has to evolve/adopt with different business model.
On the positive note, because BT got affected earlier, it will give them head start. :-)

You&apos;re probably correct, &quot;why would they stay away from such regulation in the long run?&quot; I would not be surprised if there is eventually some type of uniform standard among all the prop firms who currently require capital contributions from its traders.

Perhaps the SEC only wants the &quot;true&quot; model to survive, where the prop firm pays an initial salary, offers training without charging, and then traders use firm capital and share in the profits, whereby the firm absorbs any losses.

From what I know not many have such model. That is like Utopia.
Schonfeld is the only other company I know they had true prop model, but the latest at them is not that good either. Retail trading is fine, but it is difficult to &quot;grow&quot; as a trader. I don&apos;t mean just the profit, but overall.

Actually, hedge funds do not require traders to contribute capital, that&apos;s the risk of the outside investors who are &quot;accredited&quot; and can absorb the risk of loss.

Regarding Don&apos;s comment above, I don&apos;t think there is anyone on this planet that can &quot;force&quot; the mighty Goldman into &quot;getting rid&quot; of anything. As long as there is appetite for risk, commissions to be generated, and a fiat monetary system, trading with leverage will survive, LOL!
 Posted by CQNC on 08-13-10 07:25 PM: 
 

yes, but traders are restricted to a range of tolerable loss on their accounts with the fund, and their compensation is &quot;adjusted&quot; according to their performance, so that loss is limited to protect the fund and it&apos;s investors first, the trader second, and if he&apos;s in the negative, or takes a major hit during his contract, he&apos;s getting canned and no christmas bonus.
personally, i&apos;d put up $200K of my own money to secure my loss downside to the fund on my contract with a billion dollar hedge fund if my upside was ten times that or more. it&apos;s perfectly acceptable to my logic that i&apos;m responsible for making or breaking the fund for my part of the total. why shouldn&apos;t i be held accountable, and conversely, i&apos;m expect to be well compensated for every dime above and beyond my &quot;salary&quot; and any capital i contribute to the fund as a member.

what i want to know is where the other 97% of their tier 1 capital that is sitting in their prop divisions making 99% of their profits right now is going to go. 3% is a drop in a the bucket, and it&apos;s a big bucket.

Here in Chicago there are probably close to 40 &quot;true&quot; prop firms. It&apos;s not utopia, it&apos;s the norm here. In fact, it&apos;s harder to find a deposit prop firm here then a &quot;true&quot; prop firm.

because GS is a bank and a bank should not be gambling billions and exposing economy to systemic risks ie several rogue traders taking bad bets and destroying the entire banking system. Whatever, makes no difference. GS still has their market making business which is trade&amp;make money first, provide liquidity/serve client second.

Do y&apos;all get it now? GS retains it&apos;s market making sigma/redi biz by differentiating markt maker and prop trader tho they are essentially doing similar things.

&quot;Specialists were allowed to trade their own accounts with access to all order flow in exchange for taking market making risk being the buyer and seller of last resort&quot;.

This is a moot point. With all the recent issues of defining a market maker (Shumer, HFT, GS), which is how these firms get JBO leverage, seems regulators finally trying to differentiate what a retail trader and a market maker really is. In any event, these firms discussed in the thread use JBO leverage. JBO leverage is what the specialists and OTC market makers were given decades ago to be liquidity of last resort back in the days. Obviously cap up prop traders are not market makers but the loophole has gone on for a long time.

Whatever regulations they pass is irrelevant. Maybe some JBO firms go out of biz, who knows. But there are so many other leveraging strategies out there, that firms use such as equity derivatives that leverage firms 32:1. The business has always been about change and evolution.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I totally understand why GS is doing what they&apos;re doing from their side....and that 20 months ago (approx) they quickly &quot;became a bank&quot; when the financial debacle started...they are still some of the smartest, best connected people on the Street. Love them or hate them, don&apos;t bet against them.

The liquidity provider smoke screen (LRP&apos;s etc.) is subect to the same nightmare form the HFT as everyone else...a different, but hightly relevant point for sure.

Our last Retreat, Aug 1, we had a great follow up presentation from Dennis, our trader who has been doing such a good job of analyzing and lobbying in an effort to level the playing fields again...very optimistic, showed us how such things as &quot;tape reading&quot; (don&apos;t laugh, he had great examples) has come back into use big time - setting tickers and tapes to 4 decimial places etc., actually using some of this to our advantage again.

In any event, we&apos;re doing our best to keep all our people up to speed, not an easy task...and all is good...but I realize that I am an eternal optimist overall...I like to think &quot;prgrmatic&quot; too...we&apos;ll see how all this pans out. Been keeping Bob and I pretty busy, LOL.

Enjoy the weekend everyone...

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 Don&apos;t get me wrong, I totally understand why GS is doing what they&apos;re doing from their side....and that 20 months ago (approx) they quickly &quot;became a bank&quot; when the financial debacle started...they are still some of the smartest, best connected people on the Street. Love them or hate them, don&apos;t bet against them.

The liquidity provider smoke screen (LRP&apos;s etc.) is subect to the same nightmare form the HFT as everyone else...a different, but hightly relevant point for sure.

Our last Retreat, Aug 1, we had a great follow up presentation from Dennis, our trader who has been doing such a good job of analyzing and lobbying in an effort to level the playing fields again...very optimistic, showed us how such things as &quot;tape reading&quot; (don&apos;t laugh, he had great examples) has come back into use big time - setting tickers and tapes to 4 decimial places etc., actually using some of this to our advantage again.

In any event, we&apos;re doing our best to keep all our people up to speed, not an easy task...and all is good...but I realize that I am an eternal optimist overall...I like to think &quot;prgrmatic&quot; too...we&apos;ll see how all this pans out. Been keeping Bob and I pretty busy, LOL.

Enjoy the weekend everyone...

Don 

I&apos;m very much against HFT. Something&apos;s going to have to give there.

And, I agree, tape reading may have been a &quot;dying art&quot; in some people&apos;s eyes with all of the &quot;technology&quot; we have today, but an art that once mastered pays quite well.

Unfortunately, many prop discretionary traders are &quot;lumped into&quot; the HFT category, so if you have regulation there, u will have regulation here. My guess is since GS is king of HFT, there won&apos;t be much regulation happening. Just some minor tweaks to keep the interest groups satisfied.

interesting. i would have thought they were all based in nyc or ct.
not that you will, but i&apos;d like to see a list somewhere of these true props, see how they&apos;re being affected by the volcker rule changes.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Here in Chicago there are probably close to 40 &quot;true&quot; prop firms. It&apos;s not utopia, it&apos;s the norm here. In fact, it&apos;s harder to find a deposit prop firm here then a &quot;true&quot; prop firm.

it&apos;s not star wars yet, if that&apos;s what anyone thinks. it&apos;s mostly faster execution, and i don&apos;t see anything wrong with it if you can invest in the technology, take advantage of the advantage. but seriously, it&apos;s barclays, blackrock, jpm, gs, as the major four, and then it&apos;s banks all over the globe and hedge funds all running the same algos trying to feed like pilots off the great whites.
it&apos;ll balance out when the sec finally gets its act together to level out the latency in it&apos;s quoting system.

i know this has been discussed somewhere before, but i&apos;m also wondering how hft. gs, and prop, has been affected by the mass failure and exodus of hedge funds in london.

and if there is a thread or site someone knows of that has a decent source of london props. i only know of a few.

No, in fact, very few are in NY and I can&apos;t think of any in CT. A majority are in Chicago and London and here is your list.

 http://www.tradersnarrative.com/lis...-firms-735.html 

I was going to rattle off all the ones on the top of my head but this list is very complete although it does mix in the deposit firms as well.

There is a section below for just the London firms. Only about 25% of these are &quot;true&quot; props. I can&apos;t point out the better ones but they have been discussed at length on this forum.

I don&apos;t believe the Volker rule will affect them much since these firms are not banks and don&apos;t engage in banking activities.

I can point out some of the better firms on that list if you wish.

i believe there exists a golden opportunity to partner with the major brokerages and banks within the prop industry to create a new format of prop firm under the cbsx model that functions more as a hedge fund than this fragmented mess that exists since the assent model.

anyone else who agrees can pm me, as i will be spending quite a lot of time on this the next few months and contributing to these threads often, good, bad, or otherwise.

You attacked me on another thread and now you as asking me for favors? Look, first things first. Cool it with the attacks. You don&apos;t know who posts on this message board. Some of these people might just be able to help you out sometime down the road. You might be going off on a guy that ends up owning a firm you want to trade with. That would suck now wouldn&apos;t it?

Aside from that, sure I can give you names. I rather post them so others can see them as well. If you tell me a little bit more about what you are looking for, it would help. Like I said, there are probably 40 or 50 in Chicago alone.

I am curious as to what kind of applicants do those Chicago prop firms (true prop) hire? To have a realistic chance do the applicants have to be quants or have MBAs from Northwestern or Wharton?

I did not attack you, I pointed out something that is not correct in your post. In addition, I am not asking you for a favor. You made an offer in public, and I was trying to give you a reason to post what you wanted to post, so you can include a link to your desired site. I bet that people understand the angles of your posts.

Nowadays if someone wants something, they just make a search on a search engine, and all those with services come up, even with their ads that cost them if one clicks on them.

What is hard in the new economies is to find the customer, and not the seller of the service. My question was posed from the customer angle, not from the seller angle. Who should thank who? Got it? You seem to be still thinking like it is 30 years ago.

 Quote from Sun Light: 

 Let me try to understand this 80/20 better.
We are talking about the 1st account only. Lets leave JVC out of it for now.
If I deposit 20k with BT .
Scene 1: 1st month, I made 10K profit. Does BT get to keep 2K profit? (immediately or eventually)?
Scene 2: 1st month, If I make a loss of 10K. Does BT absorb 2K loss?
What is it? 100% traders capital, Zero % BTs loss or 20% BTs profit?
Then it should be called 80-0-20. Yeah...I still think... &quot;they got you by the balls&quot; 

How about this scenario in the 80/20 payout model:

Month 1: Trader loses 5k, hence the 20k capital contribution lowers to 15k (5k loss to the trader, zero loss to Bright)

Month 2: Trader MAKES 5k, hence the capital back to original 20k

Does Bright get the carry forward of 20% of the 5k made in Month 2, or does the trader make 100% and only splits the 80/20 AFTER being up net positive above the original capital contribution?

Thanks for input/response.
 Posted by mews on 08-26-10 01:44 AM: 
 

I&apos;m not sure how Bright does it, but in general the way most firms do it is off of a high watermark so that there is no over charging. If for example you made 10k the first month and 2k was taken out and then lost 10k and the following month made the 10k back, you are still in the same capital position but if any % was taken out the 3rd month then you would have had to give up a % on capital that was yours already.

We don&apos;t do the calc&apos;s monthly, or take out profits (bad for the trader of course)... we do the actual calculation at year end. Only if the trader draws money out do we hold the 20% reserve (give it back at year end, based on totals). Trader may make $200K, only take out $10K. Trader may make $100K, but take out $25K, we &quot;settle up&quot; at year end.

Seem like appropriate questions to me, especially to ask someone who is actively &quot;hiring&quot; on these boards. It&apos;s a crucial question for a prospective trader at Bright and a fair question to ask of any employer who is advertising for your services - how will my income be reported?

In most cases you know the answer without asking, you get a W2. You used to get a K1 from Bright. Under the new business model.....?

We have discussed with the other majors, but none can guarantee that they would not be going the same direction.

Too many traders have auto programs with Redi, so we&apos;re trying our bet to stay with GS, and we value our relationship with GS as well.

All I can say is that we&apos;re dealing with it, traders are fine. No letter from the SEC yet (&quot;open letter&quot; to trading firms from SEC)... we&apos;ll do whatever we can to make things right after it gets published. This may be &quot;much ado about nothing&quot; - in the long run.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Let me re-phrase what I&apos;m trying to say. A trader with 10k in capital has close to zero chance of ever making it. I know that, Don Bright knows that, Bob Bright knows that and everyone on the street knows that. This is what I was trying to get at when questioning Don about taking in 10k accounts, or youngsters as he likes to call them.

Look, when I started at Worldco back in 2000, we had arguably one of the best markets in history to trade. The only way we could produce good traders was to let them go anywhere from 25k to 100k deep in the red in their accounts. Even the guys that came in with capital, usually 10k to 20k, we let them go 50k into firm money. The good ones dug their way out and did well. The bad ones we cut. Net net they never really lost that much money on them as it was mostly commissions.

I know I&apos;m not suppose to say this but the biggest fraud of the prop firm business is not commissions, or leverage, or whether or not you need a series 7, it&apos;s the fact that firms sells the dream of success to young guys that don&apos;t know any better. Well I do know better. I know it not because I&apos;m a smart ass trying to pick a fight with Don, this really has little to do with Don in particular, it has to do with the fact that I&apos;ve been in this business for 10 years and have been around over 1000 traders who have gone through the system. I know the numbers because I&apos;ve seen the numbers.

There is a direct correlation between the amount of capital you have to trade and your odds of success. Not leverage, CAPITAL! These numbers are indisputable. I know them, I&apos;ve seen them.

At the end of the day, after 10 years, I realized the biggest edge in this business is not computers, not charts, not leverage, but equity. Pure old fashioned good american equity. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they are probably trying to sell you something. 

i agree for a new person....but once you overcome fees trading is equity invariant. I don&apos;t buy the biggest edge is equity, its necessary but not sufficient. NO disrespect intended, and 10 years isn&apos;t a long time in the business to speak from. If you had, say, 30 years in the business, had a section in a book highlighting great traders dedicated to what you did with an MIT punch car computer in the 60s, and bought an island, perhaps then you can tell me of all the traders who go hundreds of thousands into the red and make it, but most of those guy blow out and live in a shack somewhere. 10 years is a microsecond.

Its the men who don&apos;t manage risk well that end up broke. this bs about needed tons of capital is a lark. the tons of capital is for these pseudo trading firms to fee you to death..thats why the want guys with large deposits....is that so hard to see? Frims like to take on 25k guys cause they know the bulk of that goes to comms and fees....why take the time to talk to a 5k guy..thats not much in firm profit to milk. End of story.

If you have a small amount of capital and your trading overcomes fees, that very quickly either on its own or by scads of people throwing money at you turns into TONS of capital, if you are in the red before you start, those two former things rarely happen.
 Posted by CQNC on 08-28-10 05:01 PM: 
 

makes no difference whether your capital base is $1 or $1M to an experienced trader. i can start with $1000 leveraged and be doubled up four time in a week to cover any real potential loss in a blowout trade. it&apos;s not that difficult. just scalp the right stock. rookies, sure. they&apos;ll lose whatever they start with, guaranteed, without a system in place restricting their decisions and movements.

How about this one: what prevents them from using the 25K to lend to other traders, and use the SPAN margin to lend 20 times as much. If leverage is 20, you time that by the interest they charge on the lending, you get a good number. If you use 3% as interest charge, the 25K can make around 13K per year.

What can be worse is if a firm were to exploit the 25K and leverage by saying something like &quot;the firm can lend 500K of our capital&quot;, when in fact it is a 25k deposit of another dude multiplied by the leverage from margins.

I hope the laws prevent them from doing the above.

If someone is in the prop business, could you comment on the scenario described?
 Posted by CQNC on 08-28-10 08:23 PM: 
 

the firm should be making a significant profit on the difference between the lending rate to the trader for the few hours they&apos;re trading, if calculated as a day&apos;s interest that is, and the money market rate they&apos;re being charged by their bank. a significant profit. so how the funds are distributed, to 5 5K guys or one 25K guy, matters not except as a risk management decision. my guess is, the 25K guy is probably going all in more often and generating way higher commissions than the 5K guys combined. he&apos;s also much more profitable and less maintenance. kinda like the difference between a real wife and a trophy wife. one&apos;s an expensive whore, one&apos;s a nagging bitch.

What commissions are you paying on etrade pro?

I am sure they are nowhere near what prop firms can offer you.



 Quote from noob_trad3r: 

 So what is the purpose of joining a prop firm?

I get 100% Payouts with etrade pro minus the little commission which is nothing really.

Vs giving some firm 20% of my earnings.

I see no purpose for joining a prop firm.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 (Back from my 2 week vacation/cruise to Amsterdam, Russia, Germany, Finland, Sweden etc. - whew, talk about exhausting, but fun).

I can&apos;t say too much at this point, but the basic premise is that there is extreme pressure (so much that some &quot;competitors&quot; chose to just stop accepting new traders) to assure that we (and the other major GS firms) are &quot;true prop&quot; in that they don&apos;t have 100% payout traders).

 Reference: FINRA 10-18 - as previously discussed 

Our Accountant in Chicago who handles dozens of trading firms informs us that many are already changing policies too.

Knowing that this was coming, we set up our JVC program where traders can qualify for a second account, no downside risk, and keep at least 50% of the profits. Read previous posts or feel free to call me discuss this.

Our current traders have been advised of this upcoming event, and we suggested that those with adequate capital, take a $million or so and use IB for certain trades, keep a smaller amount to use the leverage here. We will help them with this.

We are extremely comfortable that with the other major benefits we offer that most firms don&apos;t, and that the other major firms have already adopted this, that overall this will not have a big effect for most traders. 

Don,

Could you please direct me to the Fin Reg notice that explicitly states the minimun 80% payout.

I see you reference Reference: FINRA 10-18 - which addresses master/sub-account arrangements, however, I have failed to find anything FINRA related that mentions anything about payout percentages.

Thanks in advance.

 Quote from tradingjournals: 

 How about this one: what prevents them from using the 25K to lend to other traders, and use the SPAN margin to lend 20 times as much. If leverage is 20, you time that by the interest they charge on the lending, you get a good number. If you use 3% as interest charge, the 25K can make around 13K per year.

What can be worse is if a firm were to exploit the 25K and leverage by saying something like &quot;the firm can lend 500K of our capital&quot;, when in fact it is a 25k deposit of another dude multiplied by the leverage from margins.

I hope the laws prevent them from doing the above.

If someone is in the prop business, could you comment on the scenario described? 

(Bright Tradng only, that&apos;s the only Firm I can speak for obviously)
Response to a couple of points.

Some may, but we don&apos;t have to use trades capital for the Firm&apos;s overall trading requirements. We can refund initial deposits without holding for 12 months. And, yes, I can&apos;t say for sure, but if not illegal, it should be.

OK, the retail vs. prop has been beaten to death, but just a simple example. If you have $25K and can use $50K or even $100K, you are still locked out of some successful strategies. And, if you&apos;re making $20K per year with $25k retail, how much would you make using $300k prop? And, FWIW, we are working through the 80/20 thing...who knows what things will be like next year.

Obviously it&apos;s NOT a regulatory decision and a broker one, probably forced upon them by GS raising their costs at a level other than base commissions, where at 2/1000 or whatever it is, BT isn&apos;t making enough money with the low volume and volatility levels the market is running these days.

I highly doubt this 80/20 decision is being made to increase the trader&apos;s profits. Since when does a broker ever think of anything but its own bottom line first.

Please. If I&apos;m doing 1M+ shares a month at 1/1000 or 2/1000 or whatever, the broker is making a killing on my account. The problem is these prop shops are full of rookies with very little experience and a risk aversion level so high they aren&apos;t using enough capital to make money on the interest charges side, nor are they generating high enough commission volume, nor are they likely profitable.

I&apos;ve sat down next to arrogant assholes with more cash than brains telling me this or that of what the market will do and why, analysing the charts like they were reading The Matrix, telling me I&apos;m all wrong, but end up negative loss five days in a row for having no discipline or balls to make the right decisions when. And when the inevitable &quot;prove you&apos;re smarter than me&quot; challenge comes, I&apos;ll do just that, make a decision, set a trade, hit enter, and cash out net profitable. It takes a few days before they come around to apologise, but they always do.

You don&apos;t have to have a PHD in Mathematics to be a great trader. Great traders are as rare as great athetes, great doctors, great lawyers (well, no, lawyers are all scum, but you know what I mean), great whatevers.

This whole prop discussion is, again, making me sick reading it. The model is a dog. Move to a hedge fund prop model. Dump the dead weight, stop trolling the bottom for scalpers, start paying good traders what they&apos;re worth, dump a ton of capital on them, buy them the best systems, software, and let them run.

Or get the hell out of the way for those who can. And will.

Hang in there Don. 

After we receive the proper legal letters etc. from the regulators, I&apos;ll post up what I can.

And, as amazing at it might sound, I actually agree with portions of what the above poster said about &quot;dead weight&quot; and &quot;successful traders.&quot;

I have helped Million $$ traders move capital to retail accounts, while keeping them on board for their more leveraged trading... so that they can stay in contact with the &quot;Mother Ship&quot; and be part of the team to continue making the money that allowed them this freedom. A good trader, with adequate capital, doesn&apos;t need OPM after a certain point, and would be foolish to use it.

All the best,

Don

If you can indulge my ignorance on the equity side, I have a couple questions.
Is the number of exchanges really a problem? Shouldn&apos;t the competition be good, as long as the data is brought together and displayed for everyone to see at all times?
To me the concept of Dark Pools is b.s. and very anti competitive, and shouldn&apos;t be allowed across any markets. I would be interested in your comments Don, or anyone. All orders in the markets should be visible and available to everyone to make competition fair. I don&apos;t think because some fund, or whatever has a huge order to place they should be able to hide it and try to avoid the consequences fo unloading a large postion. To me that is just a way for them to avoid paying a price for a mistake, or to enlarge their profit on a win. They should be able to put it incrementally, and people can try to figure the tape accordingly as to whether someone is bailing and try to discern whether there is a reason to run for cover or start buying.
If we are going to calim our markets are open and free the stock and commodity markets should be just that regardless of your size.

Ok my two cents its just that but....

This whole sub penny bs sucks. They have to take that away right away. There is no more incentive to provide liquidity cause you just plain don&apos;t get filled until the opportunity is GONE&gt;

So that sucks....so no more rebates I don&apos;t even really try anymore...Im just going to switch firms from my current one to knock my commissions by 40%....sad I like my firm but true business is business. thats basically covers part of the rebate i used to get.

If stuff just traded in pennies, you would have a lot more price movement....now its just a giant suckfest with thousands of shares or millions going off before the stock even moves a few pennies.

Yes...now its time to centralize the markets once again. Maybe pick the top 3 and kick everyone else out. These fragmented markets, since they prolifterate, just coincidentally happen at the time when there seems to be no liquidity.

I&apos;m not really sure I am right, but that is what I think and that&apos;s what my frustrations are.

 TRADER TALK with Bob Pisani 

 SEC&apos;s Schapiro Offers Flash Crash Clues 
Published: Tuesday, 7 Sep 2010 | 12:51 PM ET
By: Bob Pisani, CNBC Reporter

 &quot;[Schapiro] is particularly concerned about the role of dark pools and internalizing broker-dealers.&quot; 

SEC Chief Mary Schapiro, speaking at the Economic Club of New York, as expected addressed market structure issues in her speech.

While there are no new proposals in the speech, and she asks more questions than she answers, she does hint at the direction the Flash Crash report may be going, which is expected by the end of September.

After reviewing the role high frequency firm play in the market (more than 50 percent of the volume), she concludes, &quot;This transformation of market structure has raised serious questions and concerns.&quot;

Indeed, she notes that in a recent survey of buy-side traders, less than 50 percent expressed confidence in the current market structure.

 On circuit breakers : re-examine and tweak. Rather than stopping all trades in a stock for 5 minutes if a single trade occurs 10 percent away from the stock price in a 5-minute period, she proposes a limit up/limit down procedure that would directly prevent trades outside specified parameters. So rather than a total halt, trading may be allowed to occur within parameters; for example, it could trade at less than 10 percent, but not more, in a specified time period.

 On high-frequency trading : should they have some obligations as liquidity providers? They are not market makers, so they have minimal obligations. But Schapiro notes that in the Flash Crash, order book liquidity disappeared: &quot;Where were the high-frequency trading firms that typically dominate liquidity provision in those stocks?&quot;

 Market fragmentation : She notes market liquidity has fragmented: &quot;Today, the NYSE executes approximately 26 percent of the volume in its listed stocks. The remaining volume is split among more than 10 public exchanges, more than 30 dark pools, and more than 200 internalizing broker-dealers.&quot;

Of course, the SEC consciously encouraged this fragmentation under the guise of &quot;encouraging competition.&quot;

She is particularly concerned about the role of dark pools and internalizing broker-dealers, who do not display their bids and offers to the outside world; together they are almost 30 percent of total volume. Is the public being disadvantaged by this practice?

Schapiro concludes: &quot;The structure of today&apos;s markets undoubtedly offers many advantages. And, we should not attempt to turn the clock back to the days of trading crowds on exchange floors. But we must carefully consider whether our market structure rules have kept pace with the new trading realities.&quot;

 TRADER TALK with Bob Pisani 


 More on SEC&apos;s Shapiro: Strange Omissions 
Published: Tuesday, 7 Sep 2010 | 2:09 PM ET
By: Bob Pisani, CNBC Reporter

SEC Chief Mary Schapiro has spoken at the Economic Club of New York today (see my prior blog)[above]. She addressed several market structure issues, including high frequency trading, but curiously left several other important issues out.

Let&apos;s hope the SEC finally gets serious about this: the market structure it has created around Reg NMS needs some serious tweaking and was likely a major contributing factor in the May 6 Flash Crash.

I have spoken about this many times, and will be addressing these issues in more detail as the SEC publishes its Flash Crash report at the end of this month. Here are some issues the SEC needs to address:

1) How fast is fast enough? We have already decided that under some circumstances we want to slow trading down: we have circuit breakers in place. Do we want to go further? Do we really want an arms race to see if we can make trades in under a microsecond (a millionth of a second)? Should we adopt some limit on how fast trades can be made, a minimum quote duration of, say, 1 second?

2) Extend stock circuit breakers to cover the entire equity universe. Some have advocated &quot;limit up, limit down&quot; rules that would prevent trades outside of specific parameters.

3) Don&apos;t allow &quot;clearly erroneous trades&quot; to print. Once a trade prints, it becomes a nightmare making everyone whole. FINRA and the exchanges are considering clearer rules for breaking trades, which would require that trades only be broken once the stock has been halted and if it trades at a certain percent away from the price at which it was halted.

4) More data on who is trading, what, and when. Beefing up market surveillance and creating a better audit trail will increase the trust of all investors. The SEC has proposed a Consolidated Audit Trail System to track information on trading orders and is reviewing comments recently submitted by the public. This should be quickly adopted.

5) Eliminate stub quotes and raise the requirements for what it means to be a market maker. Market makers should not be able to fulfill their obligations by putting in a phony bid of $0.01. If you are a market maker and are required to provide liquidity, you should be required to provide some! The SEC has discussed requiring market makers to post bids or offers that are not more than 10 percent away from the last price, but without any size requirements this won&apos;t mean too much.

6) Promote deep order books. Exchanges for years have opposed the idea of a Consolidated Limit Order Book (CLOB), which would essentially dump all bids and offers into a single &quot;pool.&quot; It is time to rexamine this idea. There is usually plenty of liquidity, but crazy order handling rules sometimes allows absurd trades to print, far away from the best bid and offer.

7) Raise the barriers to entry for exchanges. In theory, there is no reason you could not have 100 different exchanges, but in reality when you have 100 different pricing mechanisms, it would be tough for the market participants to figure out the most efficient way to route orders...let alone the difficulties regulating all these exchanges.

 Who&apos;s trading stocks these days? I get asked this question constantly; last Friday Larry Tabb, who runs Tabb Group, and I had a fascinating discussion about high frequency trading and the Flash Crash. Here&apos;s Larry&apos;s estimates on who is trading as a percentage of total volume on all the equity exchanges.

 Who&apos;s trading? 
(% of daily volume)

- High frequency trading 56%
(includes proprietary trading shops, market makers, and high-frequency trading hedge funds)

- Institutional 17%
(mutual funds, pensions, asset managers)

- Hedge funds 15%

- Retail 11%

- Other 1%
(non-proprietary banking)

 Where does the trading occur? Here&apos;s Larry&apos;s estimates.

Exchanges 73%

Internalized 15%

Dark pools 11%

Electronic Communication

Networks (ECNs) 1%

Source: Tabb Group

You can see that dark pools and &quot;internalized&quot; trading (where market makers match orders against their own internal supply) now constitute about 26 percent of the volume. This is important, because these two venues do not display bids and offers to the outside world, they are &quot;unlit&quot; in the parlance of Wall Street.

It&apos;s not clear if removing that much liquidity from the rest of the market disadvantages everyone else. This is another issue the SEC needs to at least examine.

So who, then, are the major clearing brokers, not GS, that are doing higher than 80/20?

Don, Matt&apos;s a friend of mine. That segment and the previous one I thought were a waste of air time. The markets were never fair and never will be. When I worked at Worldco back in the day, my firm as well as yours I&apos;m sure used bullets. There was nothing legal about bullets Don. But we both used them and made money on them.

It&apos;s seems in life when people are making money, all is well with the world, but when people lose money, suddenly there is outrage. We need to take the hypocrisy out of this issue and call a spade a spade and move on.

The guy from Bright was complaining why should he not get the benefit of the fill at 14 when he is risking capital during the flash crash. Why should he get the benefit of the fill when someone is willing to pay an extra penny for it?

He makes it sound like he is using real $ to buy the stock @ 14 and the guy willing to pay .001 more is using play money. Daytraders since time past step in front of specialist in the good old days during &quot;cleanup prints&quot;,why was it ok then and not now albeit at a sub penny level?

Kinda like the guy who curses at the slow guy driving in front of him in a 25mph zone and the guy on his tail for going too fast .

Mav is right , call a spade a spade..

The market structure is stripped of displayed liquidity the more sub penny trading happens. It is in most of our self interest for this practice to end. That is the spade.

Good job Dennis! Keep up the good work.

Whose interest? Prop firms? Come on, this does not affect mom and pop investors. It only affects Johnny daytrader and Johnny daytrader has been screwing over the public for years. Now that Johnny daytrader is not making money, we need to change the system. Market structure? What about the OTC market? If we are going to bring transparency to any market, let&apos;s start there.

The point is that nobody cares about the OTC market. Our markets are supposed to be the best in the world and many businesses rely on that consistency and reliability every day. The current structure is fine for normal trading days, but when the shit hits the fan there&apos;s nobody left to provide any sort of liq because they&apos;re all out of business. That matters to everyone, not just daytraders. Investors don&apos;t trust the markets due to market structure .

I agree with starting with the OTC.

We can hopefully agree to disagree in that I honestly feel that exchange members, traders, and others who risk their money providing liquiditiy should at least be offered an equal playing field to those who don&apos;t.

A MM, DPM, whatever has certain &quot;rights&quot; but also have certain responsiblities to maintain markets etc. I have no problem with these guys. The fact that sub-pennies are being used is no big deal either....as long as everyone trades in the same denomination.

I never thought bullets were &quot;bad&quot; or illegal, simply a tool that we could use, again, no big deal. But if you were invited to a poker game, put up your money, and then were only dealt 4 cards instead of 5, or the guy sitting next to you could see the cards dealt and you couldn&apos;t.....well, you get my drift.

And I agree that &quot;mom and pop&quot; investors shouldn&apos;t care...as they shouldn&apos;t care about a transaction tax, but I think a pretty big part of our industry cares, don&apos;t you?

Of course &quot;where you stand depends on where you sit&quot; on these issues.

All the best Mav!

The current structure is fine for normal trading days, but when the shit hits the fan there&apos;s nobody left to provide any sort of liq because they&apos;re all out of business. That matters to everyone, not just daytraders. Investors don&apos;t trust the markets due to market structure . 

Well said Dustin.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Whose interest? Prop firms? Come on, this does not affect mom and pop investors. It only affects Johnny daytrader and Johnny daytrader has been screwing over the public for years. Now that Johnny daytrader is not making money, we need to change the system. Market structure? What about the OTC market? If we are going to bring transparency to any market, let&apos;s start there. 

My self interest as well as other who make their living trading. This is a trading forum isn&apos;t it?

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 I agree with starting with the OTC.

We can hopefully agree to disagree in that I honestly feel that exchange members, traders, and others who risk their money providing liquiditiy should at least be offered an equal playing field to those who don&apos;t.

A MM, DPM, whatever has certain &quot;rights&quot; but also have certain responsiblities to maintain markets etc. I have no problem with these guys. The fact that sub-pennies are being used is no big deal either....as long as everyone trades in the same denomination.

I never thought bullets were &quot;bad&quot; or illegal, simply a tool that we could use, again, no big deal. But if you were invited to a poker game, put up your money, and then were only dealt 4 cards instead of 5, or the guy sitting next to you could see the cards dealt and you couldn&apos;t.....well, you get my drift.

And I agree that &quot;mom and pop&quot; investors shouldn&apos;t care...as they shouldn&apos;t care about a transaction tax, but I think a pretty big part of our industry cares, don&apos;t you?

Of course &quot;where you stand depends on where you sit&quot; on these issues.

All the best Mav!

Don 

Don, James Simmons was asked this question on CNBC and I thought his answer was fair. He said, trading is about speed and information. Those that are willing to pay for it and build the software and use their own resources to do that, should have an advantage. That is how trading works.

I really don&apos;t feel we are liquidity providers Don although I know that is the running joke when a trader tries to defend his value in the real world to the common public. The fact is we are leaches, all of us. And each leach is trying to get the money on the ground before the other guy. If you are willing to spend 30 million for the software and staff to do what Simmons does, then by all means write the check. But you can&apos;t fault other firms for spending massive amounts of money and hours of labor to get a leg up on the competition.

Now if the government was granting this advantage through connections to special firms, then I would be all for a level playing field. Of course Don, you and I both know many firms in this country have tremendous political benefits and that is certainly something to complain about. But not when firms risk their own capital to better their business and get a leg up on everyone else.

As far as bullets go, Don they were illegal. The SEC actually stated they were. There was nothing legal about me being able to sell all the stock I wanted on a downtick while John Q Public has a market order to sell that is not getting executed because you and I are hitting every bid all the way down and not letting an uptick happen. That is the most blatant and illegal practice I think ever to come to pass in trading.

Dustin I&apos;ll take the other side of that. I would argue we need more flash crashes. In fact we need more crashes, more consequences. We seem to live in a riskless society. Can&apos;t pay your mortgage? No problem. Lost all your money in the stock market? No problem sue. The stock market is down today, no problem we&apos;ll print more money and prop it up. Can&apos;t pay your credit cards? No worries, just declare bankruptcy. Bank is about to go under? No problem, we&apos;ll bail them out with tax payer money.

Dustin, the biggest problem I see in our society is that nobody ever loses. One way or another we bail, print or subsidize every problem we have. We need flash crashes, stock market crashes, we need banks to go under.

The irony is this Dustin, the very thing you think we should avoid is the very reason the vix is going to 10 and putting every daytrader of stocks out of business due to the lack of volatility. By keeping the crashes in the system and the vix pumped, ironically you would make a much better living. Quiet poetic isn&apos;t it?

I read bullets as simply &quot;early exercised&quot; puts giving me stock.
However- I think of some of this disparity (not speed, speed is and will always get &quot;speedier&quot;)... similarly to &quot;insider trading&quot; - where some have access to the &quot;information&quot; (as you call it) and others don&apos;t. We&apos;ve always rewarded those who work hard or pay for info (I have people who have spents zillions with programs to dissect thousands of news stories, looking for keywords etc. for years...they paid and worked hard for this edge that was open to everyone)....but when even I, as a broker dealer, cannot place sub-penny orders, well that just seems wrong to me, sorry.

I&apos;ll be in Chicago next month, I&apos;ll PM you the dates, we&apos;ll get together and chat - and I would welcome meeting some of your friends who are in the HFT business, as always, I&apos;m willing to learn.

edit: regarding VIX, isn&apos;t the historical vol about 12 anyway? I totally understand the &quot;daytraders&quot; need or desire for higher vol, but we&apos;ve done ok with lower VIX numbers in the past.

Regarding bullets, you would have made a good lawyer Don. Maybe you missed your calling in life. You have a way with words.

Let me know when you are in town, I owe you a dinner.

Let me ask you this Don, is it that you feel it&apos;s wrong that bothers you on on the sub penny issue, or the fact you can&apos;t make money on it. It just seems to me our ethics and values go out in the window as long as we are profiting from it. It always becomes an ethical issue when we are not making money from it.

You are killing me on the bullets though Don. Sometimes I guess we believe what we want to believe so we sleep better at night.

No Don, the historical average is in the mid 20&apos;s on the VIX. And the last time the VIX was at 12 I remember you guys closing down 10 of your offices all over the country. In fact almost all of them. I guess because &quot;your traders&quot; wanted to work from home.

Don 

Yes I have to agree. Don can&apos;t place sub penny orders. I am also licensed but with another prop firm and can&apos;t place sub penny orders.

Im curious...who gets to place sub penny orders? Is it time to change trading structure for me again, because i want in..

Mav:

A retired fund manager I interacted with recently informed me that a prop firm is offering accounts with no deposits. Do you think it really is possible? What is the catch if any?

I visited ( http://www.vtradergroup.com ) ,and I have some questions. Could I ask them here or does it have to be in PMs?

Of course it&apos;s possible. There are many prop firms in Chicago that fully back traders. I think I have stated that already on this thread. But you better fit into the box they are looking for.

Firm questions should be directed to PM.

(bullets first: simply a tool as far as we were concerned. When the regulators said &quot;no&quot; we just stopped using them as did most firms).

I know it seems rare, but there are those who feel that ethics and trading don&apos;t have to be mutually exclusive. We can both come up with long lists of repeated legal and ethical violators that neiher of us would want to be a part of. A big difference between running a business and what some others in this industry do....we&apos;ll chat about a major current case when I see you. There have been dozens, if not hundreds of &quot;money making&quot; paths that we could have gone down over the years...actually thrown in our laps....and yet we opted against them. We abide by the rules, we pay our Compliance Officer, always have. And, we&apos;re still here, so many are not.

VIX historical - here&apos;s the chart, a bit hard to gauge the exact numbers, and I can see where you see 20 and my brother sees 12, with the lower number taking place during the 1990&apos;s. Certainly some wild moves. I&apos;ll pretty much give you that one.

 http://www.investmentu.com/2005/July/20050729.html 

Don&apos;t think the VIX had anything to do with office closures. I see where you connecting dots between high &quot;daytrader&quot; vol and volume I guess.....but, I think the fact that we opted to close offices when the price of broadband came down to a point that everyone could connect for $49.00 per month vs. putting 20 people in an office paying $5k or more, made more sense....when leases came due, we saw little reason to keep so many places open. We left 120 Broadway when GS left for NJ and we would have had to pay retail rent. Technology has allowed us to be connected with all our people, no need for brick and mortar. Would I like more places, sure, would I like more traders, sure, but we seem to be hanging in there. Things change, no big deal.

It&apos;s funny, we used to be chided for being &quot;old fashioned&quot; with too many offices, not taking advantage of the Internet, LOL. Our overall trader base is down about 10-15% from it&apos;s historical high, FWIW.

Anyway, I hope all is going well with you and your Firm and traders. I&apos;ll PM you my travel dates when I buy my tickets.

Don

Don 

Don, regarding bullets, I&apos;m not accusing you of doing anything illegal, I&apos;m accusing you of being blind to their purpose. The only reason they were legal for a few years is because like everything with the SEC, they are always 5 years behind Wall Street. They were hidden under the radar. Once the SEC found out about them, they shut them down immediately.

Your &quot;Dennis Dick&quot; is bitching about having someone subpenny him on a stock yet he probably had no issues jumping ahead of the public selling stock with impunity while the retail public is sitting on the offer waiting for an uptick to sell the stock. I&apos;m just calling him a hypocrite that&apos;s all. Doesn&apos;t make him a bad person, just a hypocrite.

Don, we use to drive down stocks 3 dollars on the open without a single uptick while the public finally gets short on the cleanup print on the lows. It got so bad the specialists firms tried to sue many prop firms for driving stocks down. Remember, specialists could not get short either until the uptick so they were getting screwed too. But anyway, I&apos;m not going to beat a dead horse here, just calling out the hypocrisy, that&apos;s all.

As to the VIX and your office closings, Don I hope you are not trying to imply having the VIX at 10 is good for your business because I know for a fact it&apos;s not. I would say daytraders in equities p&amp;l;is 100% correlated to the VIX. And trading volumes are also close to 100% correlated to the VIX. I&apos;m not trying to imply you don&apos;t have guys that can grind out a few bucks when the spoos have a 5 handle range, I&apos;m saying it&apos;s not good business. We can surely agree on that.

Sure a lot of your guys wanted to trade from home instead of going to a physical office. But Don, my friend, 100% of the true prop firms here in Chicago are all office based. Less then 1% of them trade from home and there about a thousand good reasons for that. My theory as to why many of your guys opted to trade from home (and not just your guys) is that they are what I call hobbyist traders. They are not active accounts and many of them ran other businesses while they were trading and many of them quite frankly were not profitable. This is true of most remote guys, not just at your firm.

So yes I do believe there is a correlation between your office closings and the VIX. And it wasn&apos;t just your firm, but all firms. Worldco also shut it&apos;s doors as the VIX was collapsing. That&apos;s 1000 traders Don, 1000. All gone. The elimination of bullets also contributed to that.

I&apos;m pretty sure that this conversation, though interesting to us (with the history, ancient to some, LOL, etc. WorldCo, Bullets, VIX at 10 etc. )...and I look forward to chatting over cocktails with you.

I&apos;m also pretty sure we&apos;re boring everyone to death.

If the debate on sub-pennies wants to continue, however, my position is simply an even playing field. Nothing grandiose or holier than thou, just simple fairness.

Don . 

Are you sure you want to give me cocktails, I might tell you how I really feel. 

Don my whole dissertation above speaks precisely to the sub penny issue. This whole &quot;level playing field&quot; is all bullshit. The markets have never been level. And never will be. It&apos;s always the ones on the wrong side of the trade that want a level playing field. That&apos;s why I brought up the bullet issue. You were not an advocate for a level playing field then were you? Surely you are not saying bullets were a &quot;level playing field&quot;?

The sub penny issue is a result of new technology and the evolution of markets. I am not interested in having a 100 new regulations to keep &quot;leveling&quot; the playing field. Just adapt! Pretty soon Don we are going to run out of levels and the government is just going to decide there should be no speculators period. Will you be happy then? Perfect level playing field then.

We are losing sight of what our markets exist for, they arent really for traders. If HFT, sub pennying, etc are making everything more risky then they should be banned. The liquidity card may or may not be the right way too look at things. A lot of people point to Darwin and evolution, but he doesnt say anything about wether that evolution is good or bad.

Au Contraire, I was thrilled when they eliminated the uptick rule...making a level playing field.

And if you&apos;re not for &quot;level playing fields&quot; then I might just have to ask you to play with only 4 cards in our next poker game... or to have to bet in $100 increments, or go to an auction where bidders can out bid you buy 1/100th of a penny...the public, traders, hedge funds, everyone dealt with trading in pennies, why only a few who don&apos;t even post orders be allowed to front run the rest of us?

My view, that&apos;s all...

Don

If I don&apos;t respond for a while, it&apos;s because I have to teach for a bit, but will later..... 

Edit: CNBC called me again and now wants to speak with someone from the &quot;other side&quot; who engages in HFTrading. Do you guys do it? Would you like to share your views if you do? I&apos;m serious about this.

OK, I&apos;ll listen. Walk me through this. How are sub penny&apos;s a threat to the retail public? James Simmons cited a study on CNBC saying sub penny liquidity has put billions (not millions) but billions of dollars in investors pockets since their inception. I&apos;m listening.

Don, yes you were for elimination of the uptick rule after they got rid of bullets!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone was for the elimination of the uptick rule because it was killing prop traders without the use of the bullets.

And Don enough of this poker analogy. The markets are far more complicated and fragmented then 5 guys sitting at a poker table. My argument is still and will continue to be the hypocrisy of those screaming for a level playing field only when it benefits them.

What this does Don is our society becomes a never ending tug of war of never ending regulations every time the music stops and someone loses. After a few years there are so many losers and thousands of new regulations. And the process just feeds on itself. Because those new regulations will create &quot;new losers&quot; then they complain and more regulations follow creating &quot;more losers&quot; creating more regulations and it goes on and on until the markets are one big clusterf*uck. Enough already. Let&apos;s start removing some of these regulations, not adding new ones.

I dont know if it is or isnt bad, but everyone hides behind the liquidity card. Does the public care if they get to sell shares that theyve owned for 10 years for an extra penny or two? Maybe you do get more efficency, but if the technology and strategies in order to get that extra penny results in a giant meltdown then it wont be worth it.

That&apos;s a red herring. The argument cited for the flash crash is that liquidity disappeared. Well if you remove those players from the system, guess what, the liquidity disappears! Seriously, this is much ado about nothing.

In my humble opinion, one of the biggest causes of the flash crash was the facts that all the world markets are becoming correlated to one. Everything moved together. The start of the flash crash was not in stocks by the way, it was in currencies. A huge yen carry trade got unwound across various pairs including the aussie, pound, and euro. We saw moves in those currencies that quite frankly were historical. Now who are we going to blame for that? Are we going to go after currency traders now?

When those yen trades triggered, it rolled over to the indices (futures not stock). Then as the futures tanked, stocks were the last to get hit. There was incredible size going off. The trades were real. Again, this 100% correlation thing is getting dangerous and that is because everyone is in the same trades. Why? Because we have printed so damn much money in this world and all this currency has to go somewhere. It&apos;s going into the same funds, the same strategies and their behavior is identical all moving lock step with each other. It has nothing to do with freaking pennies or sub pennies. And it will most likely happen again. Maybe we should stop printing so much f*cking money. Just a thought off the top of my head.

Unfortunately my response was killed for some reason. But Mav I would agree with you for the most part. At the same time we get regualtions from morons who go on tv every month as a result of CNBC and try to pretend they know what they are talking about before regulators and the Fed. Not that I have much respect for the Fed. We get new stupid regulations because of a few morons who manipulate the system. Like my old job there are a few who screw the rest of us that are playing by rules. There are always those that play at the lines of legal and in the long run those jerk offs screw the rest. I&apos;ve seen it in my past everyday job, and now in my job of trading. I respect what I do, but those that play at the fringe are going to make life difficult for the rest. The best I think can be done is go public with our end of the busisness, somewhat like Don does and make public the dirtbags, and stress the benfits of our end of the business.

yep, exactly.

the other side of the carry trade was corp debt. if you look up the corp debt names on the 6th, just like the yen, the move started much before the drop and really started throwing off the etfs, which in turn, which in turn...

pointing the fingers at hft&apos;s is a cop out. the reasons the markets got illiquid is because everyone&apos;s books were stuffed to the gills with the HUGE size being pushed through locked to bid. what was coming down the pipe was more than the market could bear, plain and simple.

i suppose though, it&apos;s less scary to think the flash crash happened because of some stupid computers vs a complete unraveling of our entire financial structure. computers can be regulated, financial collapse can&apos;t.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Don, yes you were for elimination of the uptick rule after they got rid of bullets!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone was for the elimination of the uptick rule because it was killing prop traders without the use of the bullets.

And Don enough of this poker analogy. The markets are far more complicated and fragmented then 5 guys sitting at a poker table. My argument is still and will continue to be the hypocrisy of those screaming for a level playing field only when it benefits them.

What this does Don is our society becomes a never ending tug of war of never ending regulations every time the music stops and someone loses. After a few years there are so many losers and thousands of new regulations. And the process just feeds on itself. Because those new regulations will create &quot;new losers&quot; then they complain and more regulations follow creating &quot;more losers&quot; creating more regulations and it goes on and on until the markets are one big clusterf*uck. Enough already. Let&apos;s start removing some of these regulations, not adding new ones. 

Actually (back to bullets) we had our own system in place when the uptick rule changed, so it was, in some ways, detrimental to our traders.

As to sub-pennies: OK, we may have to agree to disagree (again)(excuse if I put this in an extreme manner, I am smiling as I&apos;m typing)....if you dont mind this type of front-running, either by seeing orders that others dont (inside information as far as Im concerned) or being able to jump in front of existing displayed markets in denominations not available to other players, then fine.

You dont like the poker analogy (ok), but since we are supposed to have auction markets maybe the auction parallel would better fit. If youre bidding on a car, and a computer keeps bidding one penny higher ad infinitum, wouldnt you soon simply stop bidding altogether?

Regarding the govt over-regulating and eliminating speculators altogether.well (hold your breath), I agree with you in many respects. With too much regulation (as Ive just told my students)be careful what you wish for we could end up seeing shares of GE offered on aisle 5 at the local Wal-Mart at a fixed price each month. I am not an advocate of eliminating free markets, I just want the rules to be similar among the players. And I think currency denomination is vital to this.

You didnt respond to my question about you or your firm engaging in the (perfectly legal) HFtrading? Or if you would like a bigger forum to share your views. Not that you need/want me to do so, its just that I have been getting the calls lately?

Don

Don, I must have missed the question but to my knowledge, my firm does not engage in HFT.

Why don&apos;t you just pony up and get into the HFT game then? Are you trying to tell me that your firm is being blocked from the action? Build the software, contact those liquidity pools and get in the game. Honestly Don, I can&apos;t understand what you are saying here. Are you telling me that you are willing to spend the money and labor to get in that game but are not able to?

I know some HFT guys here in Chicago Don. Matt Gray who was on CNBC yesterday with your buddy, is a friend of mine. The guy built his operation from scratch Don, from scratch. He spent a lot of money and time to get into the game. Nobody stopped him. What is stopping you? Please help me understand this because I obviously am missing something here. I am all ears. You have the floor Don.

As a business decision we don&apos;t think the rewards to the Firm or the traders would justify the investment at this point in time....and, again, we don&apos;t mind the speed of access etc., more the denomination factor. We didn&apos;t dive whole hog into liquidity providing ala my friends at Swift either...that sort of fizzled out, but in all fairness made good money for Charles and Peter.

I re-watched the interview with Dennis and Matt, and it seems to me that they were more in agreement about the level playing field. The interviewer called them both HfTraders, which is simply not true (hard to figure coming from CNBC, LOL).

I applaud your buddy, as I do anyone who is entrepreneurial in this day and age...since there are &quot;no jobs&quot; as we are being told, the small business/trader (or whatever business) is the way to go. You&apos;re familiar with our story, we started from scratch (actually Bob did, I had his help, LOL)....

Okay, we&apos;re not talking about HFT being the problem here. We&apos;re talking about internalization being the problem. You can pony up all you want, get to an HFT level, and possibly participate in some internalization pools. But the ones you participate in will be exhausted flow, where the orders have already been passed over by the major B/Ds. It&apos;s not about money at the very high level. It&apos;s about your customer base, and your connections. The majority of internalized flow is done by the major B/Ds, and they are not gonna let you in that game.

Matt was behind us on that argument yesterday, re-watch the clip. There is basically three tiers. Tier 1 being the B/D internalizers, Tier 2 being the rest of the HFT world, and Tier 3 everyone else. Tier 2 we can get to. Tier 1 is unattainable.

Our reliance on debt vs equity has put the who world in a very risky situation. Everything thinks fixed income is less risky, but thats not the case. It just blows up less frequently but its much more devastating when it does. All people should be following ust market, corp bond, hy etc. When they move they take equities with them.
 Posted by CQNC on 09-16-10 06:31 PM: 
 

I&apos;m just going to post this, WTF.

I&apos;ve spent the better part of 2010 working on a business plan, funding, systems, consultants, the works, to build a new HFT-like company, looked at acquiring a couple of smaller companies in this space floundering, and talked to to seriously high up CTOs and CIO of some major technology companies looking to move into this space who don&apos;t have the wall street resumes to get past the nets at Goldman or BlackRock, but who could with a startup on their resume that did it their way. NY has this &quot;thing&quot; against silicon valley going back to the late 90s I find particularily humourous, since we were the ones bringing IPOs to them, not the other way around. They were the ones who created the bubble, we were building the companies, great companies, that died because of wall street greed.

So when I say I&apos;m &quot;on the fence&quot; about proceeding, despite having the capital and the talent and a very sound business plan, I&apos;m trying not to talk shit to promote what I&apos;m doing, I&apos;m more soliciting the opinions of a few selectively stealth individuals lurking in the weeds thinking the same thing but haven&apos;t found the right opportunity to reveal themselves to stand up and declare their presence.

Personally, I think HFT will be severely limited in terms of sub-penny and fronting by SEC restrictions in the software, the flash crash will create a whole mess of new problems for the detritivores scraping the bottom, and will likely eliminate the majority of the problem so the field is leveled. I&apos;m more interested in slower HFT, strategic trades, position trades in the &quot;dark&quot; pools out there among hedges and such based more on fundamentals than calculations, major short positions against overboughts and overvalued going into 2012 recovery earnings, mass market psychology, volatility, movement during corrections and rallies, taking advantage rather than being taken advantage of.

If any of that makes sense, I&apos;m around...

That&apos;s not true. You can get to tier 1 but you choose not. I&apos;m not saying it would be cheap, but obviously you could &quot;become&quot; a tier 1 BD internalizer&quot;. And if your response is that it&apos;s too costly to get into that business, well they &quot;did&quot; get into that business and they have a right to profit from the costs and risks associated with being in that business. Once again, I fail to see what the argument is. Look, as a BD we have certain advantages the public doesn&apos;t have by being a BD. We also have far more costs and risks then the public has as well. We can&apos;t equalize one without the other. It&apos;s called pay to play. If you want to play, then write the check.

Look, we are in the market making game. There are ridiculous costs associated with that business. However there are structural advantages over the public and other prop firms for that matter by being in that game. Anyone can get into that game but it&apos;s not cheap and certainly is not easy. So I&apos;m still lost here on the argument.

Anyone passing the regulatory approval process and the minimum capital requirement can become BD to access Tier 1. $2500 a month for a CBSX and $100K. That&apos;s it. Does th e CBOE take VISA?

Please, this isn&apos;t like needing to know the secret password for admission into The StoneCutters or if have special birthmark on your ass, you&apos;re in Homer.

Just buy your way in, and if you can&apos;t, play the game at the level you&apos;re allowed the best you can.

 Re: outrage? 

What I don&apos;t understand about the argument is, why, if one can see the order at .001, the trader isn&apos;t adjusting his range of execution in his limit order to allow for that possibility and get filled within that range? If his order is at 14 and the other order is at 14.001, that&apos;s part of the spread, and if you&apos;re not filled, too bad. I don&apos;t see what&apos;s unfair about that.

I don&apos;t trade like this, so I&apos;m not an expert, it just seems logical to me.

 Quote from MushinSeeker: 

 The guy from Bright was complaining why should he not get the benefit of the fill at 14 when he is risking capital during the flash crash. Why should he get the benefit of the fill when someone is willing to pay an extra penny for it?

He makes it sound like he is using real $ to buy the stock @ 14 and the guy willing to pay .001 more is using play money. Daytraders since time past step in front of specialist in the good old days during &quot;cleanup prints&quot;,why was it ok then and not now albeit at a sub penny level?

Kinda like the guy who curses at the slow guy driving in front of him in a 25mph zone and the guy on his tail for going too fast .

Mav is right , call a spade a spade..

If you&apos;re a .14 bid, and the only displayed order, and a market order comes in to sell, then someone jumps in front of you for .14001 to snag the order, leaving you stranded...and you cannot pay .140002 or something, you would have to pay a full penny more to get executed....but when an order comes in to sell at .10, then the HFT &quot;can&quot; hit your bid at .14 leaning on the lower limit order. So the other marder &quot;saves&quot; a hundreth of a penny, and you either get locked out or pay a full penny, a hundred times ....when you are the only displayed order. You or us simply cannot trade in this lower denomination...that&apos;s where the game is not right, IMO.

I say let all the speed in the world continue to get speedier, just give us all the same increments.

Don 

Thank you Jesus! Thank you Jesus! Praise the Lord!

F*ck! I finally got it out of you. Beer is on me Don. Tell me when.

That&apos;s all I wanted you to say. You do not want to spend the money. That is where I&apos;ve been trying to go. Jesus it took like 10 posts for you to say that. It&apos;s not a question of access, it&apos;s a question of costs. And you know what Don, those other firms &quot;did&quot; make the investment. They took the risk. And they are entitled to whatever rewards if any come from that. Case closed.

Don, our conversations on here and in person will go much smoother if you just get straight to the point a little faster. 

I&apos;m not getting any younger here you know.

 Re: Re: Re: outrage? 

OK, for the sake of playing dumb for everyone else out there, even though I am admittedly ignorant when it comes to this argument, I still don&apos;t see how this is any different than any other buy/sell spread situation, be it a sub-penny or an 1/8th on the old system, or to the second decimal point previous to HFT moving it into the fourth decimal point now. My trading software allows for orders to be placed in a range to the .0001 increment, so I&apos;ll simply place a limit order to execute within .00xx to ensure I&apos;m filled to allow for the possibility of a market order coming in late at .10 and then &quot;stealing&quot; my order at the lower price.

It seems to me, logically speaking, Mr. Spock, that if you&apos;re nickel and pennying yourself into a corner like this to get burned, you&apos;re not that smart to begin with to allow that possibility, and that maybe, just maybe, the other guy has the jump on you.

Isn&apos;t this what trading is about?

I don&apos;t remember anyone ever promising me that life was fair.

Not a matter of buying computers, but of engaging in something that is &quot;similar&quot; to what I described about Swift, and how they have had their run....big investments for short term profits are not where we like to go. Bright &quot;buying&quot; our way into a different world, although doable, is not what we do...hell, we&apos;d be in the &quot;genteman&apos;s club&quot; business if that were the case, LOL.

It will be interesting to see how this pans out...I&apos;m overall optimistic...because trading is still trading.....just different tools.

You have a valid point, sort of like the shill at the auction who pumps up the price to make the &quot;chump&quot; pay up...is it really the shill&apos;s fault...I don&apos;t think so. We know that you cannot &quot;hustle&quot; someone who is not trying to hustle you (or someone else).

We are more than willing to share the risks involved competing against smarter people, faster computers, better analytics, quicker news (as long as it is available to everyone, and not &quot;insider&quot; information)...and feel strongly that we will do fine.

The problem is with the actual increments that have circumvented the currency trading standard.

Sure, we could take a machine gun to a knife fight and win, and then we can buy bigger and better guns, but that doesn&apos;t make us the winner of the knife fight...insert boxing match weight classes now...gotta keep within your class, can&apos;t heavyweight vs. welterweight (sorry, but I&apos;m running out of parallels here, LOL). The boxing commission wouldn&apos;t allow that, right?

How much are we talking about here, seriously? $1M, 2M, 5M?

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Thank you Jesus! Thank you Jesus! Praise the Lord!

F*ck! I finally got it out of you. Beer is on me Don. Tell me when.

That&apos;s all I wanted you to say. You do not want to spend the money. That is where I&apos;ve been trying to go. Jesus it took like 10 posts for you to say that. It&apos;s not a question of access, it&apos;s a question of costs. And you know what Don, those other firms &quot;did&quot; make the investment. They took the risk. And they are entitled to whatever rewards if any come from that. Case closed.

Don, our conversations on here and in person will go much smoother if you just get straight to the point a little faster. 

I&apos;m not getting any younger here you know.

 Quote from Don Bright: 

 Not a matter of buying computers, but of engaging in something that is &quot;similar&quot; to what I described about Swift, and how they have had their run....big investments for short term profits are not where we like to go. Bright &quot;buying&quot; our way into a different world, although doable, is not what we do...hell, we&apos;d be in the &quot;genteman&apos;s club&quot; business if that were the case, LOL.

It will be interesting to see how this pans out...I&apos;m overall optimistic...because trading is still trading.....just different tools.

Don 

But Don, why the charade. Why is Dennis Dick going on CNBC? You were running around like a chicken with your head cut off screaming or implying that something illegal was going on and this must be stopped. The field is level. You just get the service you pay for.

Obviously eating at a fast food restaurant is not as good as eating at a 5 star restaurant. But it costs more money to eat at the 5 star restaurant. It&apos;s unfortunate that there are many in our society that don&apos;t have the funds to enjoy that luxury but as I said before, it&apos;s available, at a cost. I thought I was going crazy there for a moment. I just could not see what you and Dennis were complaining about.

And please for the love of god with that power point of yours, stop blaming the flash crash on sub penny stuff. I posted earlier my thoughts on that. The sub penny had nothing to do with the flash crash.

I gotta stick with the Pro boxing analogy, or now, we could go to drag racing, one of my favorites to watch. If you&apos;re making money racing funny cars, the top fuel guys can&apos;t run in your bracket. Yes, we could buy a top fuel car, but then that is a different world... we, as traders are in this world.

If all HFT were fighting each other, great, I have no problem...I guess I should stop saying HFT, that&apos;s not the real problem, it&apos;s more the structure and the sub-penny increments.

As I said, it will be interesting to see how this pans out... in the meantime, our job here is to help our traders make money.

Back later...

LOL, yes...back in the day that&apos;s what we computerized options traders were accused of too. Having an unfair disadvantage over everyone else.

Guess what...we did....I would get up at 2AM, plug in a telephone to a cradle, and dial up at 300 baud to Blair Hull&apos;s mainframe to run all the &quot;sheets&quot; from all the options exchanges....the print outs (on heat sensitive paper, LOL) would have to bs cut by hand by stock....

These sheets would give us our edge...theoretical values of options, spreads etc. using Black Sholes modified formulas...we would be able move prices around based on these pricing models, deltas, gammas, betas, all the greek stuff....and yes, WE had an Edge......

BUT we all traded in the same denominations and currency. We were faster, and better informed...but others could, for a price, buy all the stuff we had to compete with us (and everyond did eventually)...but we still traded the same exchanges, same times, same increments.

Don, just an honest question here. But wouldn&apos;t your efforts be greatly improved if you and Dennis and the whole family over there at Bright just worked on trading better instead of trying to change the system? Maybe give futures a whirl? LOL.

I think we&apos;re going to have a lot to talk about.

We always multi-task, working with our traders is top priority, and we saved them a lot of money explaining all this last year...wht to look out for etc., stop parking certain orders etc. And our Chicago manager just flew out here to talk to our people about how he is making good money every month etc.

This bit of &quot;lobbying&quot; has probably taken more timeo here on ET that all our other efforts combined. We know where our priorities are....and, yes, looking forward to a long lunch with you to chat.

The playing field has never been more level.

But do you have the will?

The problem for most of ET is the rube has been smashed, so volume and range contract, making his job tougher. Hence the perfect scapegoat in HFT. Even the professional who was loving when the VIX was making like Elton John&apos;s Rocket Man is looking askance at HFT. Now he actually has to work to earn his keep.

Specialists used to rip you for fractions. You cheered when Lehman went down. Applauded when GS became a &quot;regular&quot; bank. Free market, free market. Now the new edge has been sliced to a .001 &quot;rip&quot; and Tradeworx is the a-hole?

What else do you want? Your scam of providing &quot;liquidity&quot; to the dentists and chiropracters of the world to continue? Who you then &quot;front run&quot; while you sit in front of your computer while they&apos;re fitting a crown. And if they cant adjust because they dont have a cable modem or T-1 line or because you sit in front of a monitor 12 hrs a day while they crack backs? That&apos;s their problem you say.

Well, now it&apos;s your problem. Because...

They&apos;ve been flushed. Time to adapt. This is a professional&apos;s market now. And it&apos;s about survival not maintaining the pig trough.

If you dont want to pay up then write the check, hire the Chinda talent and play whack a mole with the rest of the bots. Otherwise dont complain or make a guy like Mav head of the SEC.

Don, you&apos;re killing me in this thread. When has Wall St EVER not been about &quot;making the chump pay up&quot;?

HFT is just the latest evolution of that. If you dont like being the chump then pay up.

Mav and Propseeker are spot on in this thread re: May 6.

Lastly The only time I was more upset about finding about the true RIP that bullets were... is when they took em away 
 Posted by lescor on 09-16-10 10:50 PM: 
 

Let me see if I can summarize this very wordy discussion a couple sentences.

Dennis Dick and Don Bright are saying it&apos;s not fair that some traders or trading enterprises can enter sub-penny orders, but they can&apos;t. They are at an unfair competitive disadvantage because the rules apply differently to them (they aren&apos;t allowed to enter sub-penny orders).

Mav and a couple others say the playing field is level because anyone who wants to pay enough money for the right setup can enter sub-penny orders.

Does that about sum it up? What am I missing here?

This was what I was thinking, was the only logical answer to my question. And if this is the case, then yes, I agree, it is unfair and should be corrected immediately by the SEC, with no valid possible argument to the contrary to allow it to continue.

The few should not profit from the exploitation of the masses in a modern, educated, civilised society.

Don Bright (not an alias), representing a known firm (Bright Trading), advocates greater transparency in the markets and a level playing field, while Maverick (probably an alias, PM for details), who admittedly works for an unnamed broker/dealer (without HFT customers or connections, wink, wink) defends the current system (dark pools, b/d internalization, sub-pennying, flash orders, etc), as unchanged in its reliance on corruption, so get over it, Don.

Ultimately, regulation is determined to what benefits the average investor and well avg joe can&apos;t spend that kind of money to co-locate. When there is no public, there is no real market. It&apos;s just sharks and killer whales now. The flash crash had all to do with the fact that these &quot;market makers&quot; are proprietary trading stratgegies in disguise. Sure, can&apos;t expect MM&apos;s to just be waiters and not profit, but the skew overwhelmingly favors the MM. And they&apos;ve got risk controls, if the market is collapsing and domino&apos;ing, why participate? Why make a market? That was May. Hence, circuit breakers. Regulators realize MM&apos;s can&apos;t be counted on.

Today&apos;s mantra for the MM is &quot;Me profit first, serve market/provide liquidity second&quot;, vs. the old auction system where &quot;provide liquidity first, get to trade account in exchange for offering that service&quot;.

Take the tin foil hat off your head. Everyone on this forum knows my BD is VTrader. Most people also know my name. I keep regular office hours and many ET members call me and meet with me in person. My two main points on this topic are one, hypocrisy and two, over regulation. Don admitted himself the issue was his firm&apos;s desire not to pay up to play the game. That is his decision. Other&apos;s have paid up and are playing. Some of them are profiting from that, others are not. Just like any other market.

this is bullshit. talk to traders who were around in 87... ask them how many stocks had a bid.

the only difference between then and now is there was a human there to see the obvious idiocy of hitting a specialist quote 99% outside of the market. everything else was the same: excessive selling pressure that wiped out the majority of bid liquidity.

if there was anyone to &apos;blame&apos;, it was the idiocy of these &apos;dump at any price&apos; algo&apos;s that were unleashed that day. a close second are the exchanges with zero volatility auctions or breakers.

market makers behaved as they always have: provide liquidity until they&apos;re stuffed to the gills, and then step away. this will never change. you can&apos;t regulate someone to go bankrupt just so some idiot can dump his wad on you. that&apos;s not how markets work.

yes, but specialists weren&apos;t pulling bids and waiting to buy the low of the day. Research how many MM&apos;s bot the bottom that day in may for a trade. profit first, liquidity second.

and research how many MM&apos;s were bidding subpennies above the bid at the low.

liquidity exists because people have an incentive to provide it (profits).

take away that incentive and force them to make a market at any cost &apos;for the greater good&apos;, and you no longer have a market.

think about it for a second. you can&apos;t force altruism in place of basic personal survival and expect that system to work for even a small amount of time. state mandated suicide, regardless of how wonderful it might sound, is just not sustainable.

 Quote from lescor:

In my experience sub-penny trades are one of three things:

1. Broker internalization
2. Dark pool trades
3. Specific types of order sent to certain ECNs/exchanges that sometimes execute at partial penny increments.

Normal prop firms can&apos;t access broker internalization pools. Granted, this is where a lot of the partial penny trades happen.

Hopefully most prop firms have access to at least a couple sources of dark liquidity. If you can&apos;t route directly to a pool, you should still be able to hit SOME dark stock through specific types of orders through the public ECNs.

Most of the major exchanges and ECNs allow for orders that can execute in between the spread. Some partial penny prints are these types of orders.

again, i never said a market maker should be a cashier at mcdonalds. however, stock prices should be based on true supply and demand. not fragmented liquidity across 80 darkpools whenever the MM programs feel like providing liquidity.

think about it for a second. you can&apos;t force altruism in place of basic personal survival and expect that system to work for even a small amount of time. state mandated suicide, regardless of how wonderful it might sound, is just not sustainable.

 Quote from Lights: 

 again, i never said a market maker should be a cashier at mcdonalds. however, stock prices should be based on true supply and demand. not fragmented liquidity across 80 darkpools whenever the MM programs feel like providing liquidity. 

Why don&apos;t prop traders provide liquidity? Every time the SEC tries to come down on prop traders, they always cry &quot;don&apos;t hurt us, we provide liquidity to the market.&quot;

 Quote from Lights: 

 87, 29 is a poor analogy to flash crash. 87 didn&apos;t recover all it&apos;s losses in 2 days. 
it wasn&apos;t an analogy. 87 is a great reference for pre-algorithmic market crash dynamics within recent memory. the dynamics don&apos;t change regardless of mechanics: if you stuff more than the market will bear, you will crash it. period.

the recovery speed has little relevance, but since you brought it up...

the reason for the swift recovery, was due to time-frame. trillions of dollars were sold AT MARKET in the span of 10 minutes. liquidity was exhausted and things went to zero. due to the speed, and due to the obvious idiocy of doing such a thing, there was MUCH speculation and &apos;propaganda&apos; that the crash was due to error. all error&apos;s in the markets reverse themselves almost immediately.

again, if you want to place blame, get out your pitchfork and go on the manhunt for the idiots who dumped so much at market. go after the exchanges for allowing idiots to dump so much with out any controls in place. but don&apos;t go after the guys who wouldn&apos;t bend over for these retards... they&apos;re the only ones who actually acted rationally, sanely.

I honestly don&apos;t understand that response. Bright Trading, like most prop firms, is technically in the liquidity providing business too. Now obviously they only want to &quot;provide&quot; that liquidity when they feel they will profit from it. I don&apos;t think Don teaches his traders to look for trade setups that will lose money. Therefore it&apos;s safe to assume all traders and prop firms behave in this manner. They trade when they think they can profit from it. If they can&apos;t, then they don&apos;t.

What I am saying is all the complaining about them pulling their bids seems to have opened the door for good old Donny boy to start placing his bids. Did he? Did Bob Bright? And if they didn&apos;t, why didn&apos;t they? Pot meet kettle.

any retail trader can convert to prop, or at minimum, trade within the daytrading rule with 25K equity. if they can&apos;t, then they trade at their own peril. the raison d&apos;etre of prop is leverage.

technically everyone is a market &quot;maker&quot; for whatever brief moment their order is in the queue. i can make or break any market i want, in any stock i want, for all of a microsecond, or all day if the stock has no volume, options are a great example of this, set the bid/ask at the price i want to pay/sell and wait for a matching order from the opposite side of the trade buy/sell at my mark. i don&apos;t have to sub-penny it, or front-run it, or do any of that crap to set the market.

the market is what the market decides. it&apos;s not controlled by any one person or entity, so the idea goldman sachs is the market, is just ludicrous. if the market wanted to, it could wipe goldman out in a flash, but as we well know, goldman has the collective intelligence and systems in place to adjust with the market.

i&apos;m not sure what the argument is here...

They were an HFT operation. The group made billions. HFT at all the investment banks and prop firms for that matter fall under proprietary trading.

i know who peter muller is, and in my opinion, having the equivalent of a phd in mathematics (his bio says he has only a ba from princeton, but i&apos;m sure he&apos;s more than worthy of more lofty parchments) deems him worthy of making as much money in the financial markets as he wants. i don&apos;t remember it being written anywhere that capitalism is supposed to be fair and equitable, despite michael moore making a fool of himself taping wall street as a crime scene.

let me ask you a question lights. please answer specifically.

1) exactly how should market makers (hft&apos;s whatever you want to call them) have handled may 6th with market orders coming down the pipe on ALL their stocks sweeping the book down 10-90%+ in seconds?

2) do you know what an ISO is? this was the primary tool used on the 6th, and they resulted in FILLS, not pulls.

you asked me if i did the research... i actually have. i had to research it, because i traded it and it was a fantastic example of an intraday black swan.

market makers got STUFFED that day. across the board in EVERYTHING. i trade full-auto prop, making markets, and i can say that I got completely STUFFED that day, capital completely maxed out (too early btw), and sat through a period of complete chaos until those sellers let up.

it wasn&apos;t about pulling bids, it was about sellers DESTROYING bids, DESTROYING bid books all the way down in a blink. over and over. in minutes and seconds. EVERYTHING. you couldn&apos;t even hedge. the fckin spoo pit was 10 handles spread! 10 HANDLES! why?! because they&apos;d swept that too!

if you were making markets that day, you would KNOW. it wasn&apos;t as one-sided as you make out to be.

Who you should be mad at is our f*cking government that keeps bailing them out. Your anger Lights is directed in the wrong direction. These guys are not making risk free money. They are taking a lot of risk. Their drawdowns are huge. The problem here is not what they are doing, it&apos;s the fact they never have to pay the consequences when they are wrong (I&apos;m speaking of the large investment banks).

Lights calm down man. No more coffee this morning for you. Look, I really think you do not understand how this business works. Ok, those numbers you are throwing at me, I know how guys on ET like to get a hard on when they hear them but the truth is, those numbers are really rather bland. When you look at their actual return on capital, they are making fractions of a percent a day. Probably half a percent, maybe a quarter. I know a lot of guys that consistently make a 1/4 to 1/2 a percent a day.

The only difference is size. These banks have billions to work with. The numbers are not as sexy as the media makes them out to be. Yes, they are consistent. But that consistency really is analogous to an option premium seller which is synthetically what their p&amp;l;profile looks like. Very small consistent profits when markets are slow and calm followed by huge drawdowns when volatility explodes. There is nothing really new here. I still don&apos;t know what your gripe is.

while not 100k/day, i&apos;ve only had 2 losing days this year. a couple other guys i trade with are similarly consistent. we don&apos;t do dark-book arb or any of the other super low-latency stuff. it&apos;s pretty much vanilla market making on stat arb books.

consistency in trading is about frequency. basic game/probability theory. understand it, it will help get rid of your chip.

if you have an edge and can trade it a gazillion times a day, you&apos;re gonna make money every day. period. how much is a function of capital and scale. two things gs has down pat.

You left out the bailout for these large institutions, ie socialized losses. None of this is new information, the problem with human beings is that our hindsight is perfect, should LEH with all its flaws have been bailed as opposed to GS or Bear, that really gets to the heart of it; politics trumps money at a certain point but they are so close its hard to tell them apart.

The problem lies in the fact that these markets don&apos;t trade off supply/demand but in a correlational matrix superlevered into monstrous macro hedges and cross derivatives. If nobody&apos;s learned anything from the CDS MBS and CDO markets, this discussion is pointless.

Liquidity is eventually inversely correlated to the magnitude of leveraging in the open interest. This is what can happen to a gazillion dollar levered market at mid teen VIX. calm before storm, complacency prior to destruction, etc.

Some big whale pulled the plug that day after he sniffed out open positions he didn&apos;t wanna have to serve.


They&apos;re not really black swans. They&apos;re just events that most people are blind to or rather too dumb to see beforehand. The false assumption is that there will always be liquidity. Programs do a good job in proving that is false, real fast.

 Quote from propseeker: 

 let me ask you a question lights. please answer specifically.

1) exactly how should market makers (hft&apos;s whatever you want to call them) have handled may 6th with market orders coming down the pipe on ALL their stocks sweeping the book down 10-90%+ in seconds?

2) do you know what an ISO is? this was the primary tool used on the 6th, and they resulted in FILLS, not pulls.

you asked me if i did the research... i actually have. i had to research it, because i traded it and it was a fantastic example of an intraday black swan.

market makers got STUFFED that day. across the board in EVERYTHING. i trade full-auto prop, making markets, and i can say that I got completely STUFFED that day, capital completely maxed out (too early btw), and sat through a period of complete chaos until those sellers let up.

it wasn&apos;t about pulling bids, it was about sellers DESTROYING bids, DESTROYING bid books all the way down in a blink. over and over. in minutes and seconds. EVERYTHING. you couldn&apos;t even hedge. the fckin spoo pit was 10 handles spread! 10 HANDLES! why?! because they&apos;d swept that too!

if you were making markets that day, you would KNOW. it wasn&apos;t as one-sided as you make out to be.

 Quote from Maverick74: 

 Lights, you keep talking but you never say anything. There is an old saying, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. You are bringing nothing to the table. You keep screaming and yet no one on this thread knows wtf you are screaming about. Your argument keeps shifting without ever actually saying what it is you are arguing about. Honestly there has not been one post of substance from you on this thread. Not one material piece of information. Hell no one on here even knows what you are upset about as a prop trader. 

Second that. I still don&apos;t know WTF he&apos;s talking about here, or what point he&apos;s trying to make. My guess is, he got his ass reemed on May 6, or during the 2008 crash, and he&apos;s blaming GS, his own broker, or someone that he perceives as an enemy of the state.

Or, the most likely suggestion is, he&apos;s just playing devil&apos;s advocate, trolling for the fun of pissing everyone off. He does seem to have your attention, which Mav, I&apos;d be ignoring him at this point for having nothing really to say except to read himself screaming.

Hey Prop,

When you say &quot;vanilla market making on stat arb books&quot;, are you referencing Pairs Trading based on intraday support resistance levels with the pairs?

 Quote from propseeker: 

 while not 100k/day, i&apos;ve only had 2 losing days this year. a couple other guys i trade with are similarly consistent. we don&apos;t do dark-book arb or any of the other super low-latency stuff. it&apos;s pretty much vanilla market making on stat arb books.

consistency in trading is about frequency. basic game/probability theory. understand it, it will help get rid of your chip.

if you have an edge and can trade it a gazillion times a day, you&apos;re gonna make money every day. period. how much is a function of capital and scale. two things gs has down pat.

- Prop trading was banned at banks. Market making was not.
- Bank market makers are prop trading in disguise.
- Banks should not be making markets utilizing public FDIC deposits.
- Somehow, this was ignored in Finreg as possible systemic risk even after the CDO mess and financial crisis which was not about housing prices, but lack of liquidity in the derivative market.

and most importantly...

HFT market makers DO NOT ADD LIQUIDITY. They add VOLUME.

And there is a big difference between liquidity and volume.

Say volume is 12 billion shares, who cares. 75% of volume isn&apos;t even real. when the news event occurs, or the HFT programs which trade off technical analysis and open interest watch the trap door opens, then there&apos;s nobody there to buy. You can see this when VIX volatility increases there is much more volume yet more slippage ie in 2008 bear.

In 1987, liquidity wasn&apos;t dependent on an inverse head and shoulder pattern or whatever. Specialists weren&apos;t sentiment analyzing machines studying real time technical analysis to pre-emptively figuring if they should be providing liquidity.

I do expect the regulators get it all wrong tho and keep a blind eye. A simple bank run would create illiquid markets. Then, markets will inevitably crash.

I disagree, because if I&apos;m an HFT trader and using the same technical analysis trigger points, there is no trap door waiting for me, I know where other HFTs are setting their marks, and if I don&apos;t happen to be focused on a specific mark of another HFT when a so-called trap door opens, I&apos;m not exposed to that trade anyway, I&apos;m focused on something else. And, any trap doors that do open, I&apos;m going to see or be alerted to after they occur to react accordingly, whether I&apos;m watching that stock to make a trade or not. One does not have to be in a position all the time to make a position. Most of the time, I&apos;m waiting on someone else to make the first move, let them leap off the cliff first so I can decide if I want to follow them or not.

Some of us aren&apos;t the lemmings like others that appear to be in this thread...

And since I&apos;m always watching the VIX and have my own alerts and triggers set, as soon as it moves, I&apos;m moving with it as quickly as any other HFT is.

Just because a non-HFT or automated trader is stuck in retail, or isn&apos;t as closely (as in a higher execution latency time across the network) as an HFT is connected to their broker/dealer or the exchange directly as the IBs or BDs are themselves, doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s something wrong with the system.

What&apos;s wrong is that you&apos;re not keeping up with technology, and getting burned by it, or blaming market makers allegedly hiding as props, is nothing but sour grapes.

Don&apos;t blame the game, blame the player. In this case, it&apos;s you for not being able to play as well as the competition to win. The markets aren&apos;t fair, it is war by all definitions, the rules of the playground are always in effect, and may the best man get rich.

 Quote from Lights: 

 Wrong. GS&apos;s golden goose is sigma X market making. 

Question Lights:

Do you have sufficient capital to access/utilise SigmAX (or any of the major dark pool systems) as do clients using GS as their prime broker? Are you moving millions of shares in one transaction, or per day, or per week, or per whenever, to justify the expense of needing a much wider spectrum in which to execute your trades?

If not, then what are you complaining about? If you&apos;re retail, or even low-level prop trading a few thousand shares, then the information provided to you at whatever level quotations you are paying for, is your swimming pool.

Anything larger, is out of your reach and not relevant to you, nor are or you relevant to the larger fish, playing in deeper, darker seas.

If you can&apos;t be profitable at the level in which you are competing, then you should consider not competing at all.

They were probably doing their spoofing manually. No HFT involved. Based on the info I&apos;ve seen, they were just layering the book with large orders. People have spoofed forever, and it still happens all day, every day. This case really doesn&apos;t have anything to do with HFT.

they were stacking the book with size in order to manipulate algo&apos;s and other traders who react to to size. i think every trader i know has done that at one point in order to try and attract some liquidity. looks like they made it their strategy though, or in the very least part of an order execution algo.

this type of spoofing is actually pretty widespread, but this is the first time in the US where it was actually deemed manipulation. i can see the reasoning behind deeming it that, but it&apos;s not exactly what i&apos;d call &apos;pure manipulation&apos;, ie not without risk. a couple of months ago there was a russian firm doing that on XLF. they got stuffed with something like 10M shares, turned off their computers, and disappeared. their clearer dropped a 1M or so trying to unwind it. anyway, point is, it&apos;s not always black and white... sometimes the &apos;manipulator&apos; gets manipulated.

Whenever I hear the term &quot;spoofing&quot;, that&apos;s exactly the scenario that comes to mind. I think it happens more often than people realize except in much smaller sizes.

So in this case where they were &quot;stacking the book&quot;, it was a broker-dealer and got fined by FINRA. The question is, how was this any different when a Level 2 screen &quot;creates&quot; size, attracts liquidity, and the stock immediately runs the other way. Don&apos;t MM&apos;s do this all the time? Show bids/offers, attract liquidity, then pull the bids/offers immediately thereafter. Traders can post bids/offers and cancel anytime as long as they have the bp/margin to satisfy order entry. Is there a rule for MM&apos;s or broker-dealers that your &quot;stacked&quot; order MUST stay on the queue for a specified time period?

In other words, how does one draw the line between normal market activity and &quot;manipulation?&quot; If as you say &quot;spoofing is actually pretty widespread&quot; then enforcement would seem very subjective.

 What the SEC Staff Will Likely Recommend in Reaction to the May 6th Flash Crash 
 A Themis Trading LLC White Paper 
September 24, 2010
By Sal Arnuk and Joseph Saluzzi

 Introduction 

The SEC staff is likely to issue recommendations shortly for preventing another May 6th Flash Crash. Certainly, the staff has taken on a daunting task, with no shortage of critics questioning every move, but it should be congratulated for a diligent undertaking. That being said, we anticipate that the recommendations may be more on the order of temporary Band-Aids, although we still hold out hope for a pleasant surprise. While implementation of some technical fixes may decrease the likelihood of another May 6th, they will not address the root problems that have been exposed in our Frankenmarkets. Those recommendations are likely to come later.

Ultimately, the investing public and by that we mean traditional institutional and retail investors, managing pension, 401K and IRA money will decide whether the committee has done enough to restore confidence. The Flash Crash erased $862 billion in equity value in 20 minutes. Since then through August, investors have withdrawn nearly $57 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds, the most during any four-month period since 2008, according to the Investment Company Institute. Third quarter average daily trading volumes are down more than 25% from the second quarter and down more than 15% year over year. Investors are as risk-averse today as at any point in the past 10 years, with the exception of the height of the financial system meltdown, according to the State Street investor confidence index.

The question is: How long can Wall Street sustain this situation?

 Likely SEC Staff Recommendations 

Based on the preliminary findings of the Joint CFTC-SEC Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, existing SEC proposals and comments from market participants, we believe the SEC staff will make four major recommendations:

1. Alter the existing single stock circuit breaker to include a limit up/down feature. The SEC has implemented a single stock circuit breaker (SSCB) pilot program which halts any stock currently in the program for five minutes if the price moves 10% or more in the preceding five minute period. We commented to the SEC that the current program was triggering unnecessary halts. To improve the SSCB, we recommended that before a halt is issued, a minimum number of trades at the threshold level should have to occur. We also recommended that the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) should be checked before the halt is issued. Other commenters have recommended that the SEC revise the halt process to a limit up/down feature similar to what is used in the futures market. We believe the SEC will alter the existing SSCB to include a limit up/down feature, as well as some form of price check and minimum number of trades, to prevent false triggers.

2. Eliminate stop-loss market orders. Many investors that lost money on May 6th did so because they thought they were protecting themselves with stop-loss market orders. As the market melted down, these orders were activated and chased prices down a vicious spiral. These orders were not the cause of the Flash Crash per se, but they resulted in enormous damage to many unsuspecting traditional investors. The SEC has indicated that it may require market order collars, effectively converting market orders into limit orders.

3. Eliminate stub quotes and allow one-sided quotes (a stub quote is basically a place holder that a market maker uses in order to provide a two-sided quote). When Accenture (ACN) traded at $0.01/share on May 6th, it traded against a stub quote. When asked about stub quotes at a May 11th Congressional hearing, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said: When a market order is seeking liquidity and the only liquidity available is a penny-priced stub quote, the market order, by its terms, will execute against the stub quote. In this respect, automated trading systems will follow their coded logic regardless of outcome, while human involvement likely would have prevented these orders from executing at absurd prices. Stub quotes did not cause the May 6th flash, but May 6th exposed the practice of stub quotes and now the SEC will act to eliminate them. Exchanges also recently proposed a ban on stub quotes. They requested that all market makers be mandated to quote no more than 8% away from the NBBO for stocks in the circuit breaker pilot program and during the hours that the circuit breakers are in effect (9:45am-3:35pm ET). Exchanges proposed that market makers be mandated to quote no further than 20% away from the NBBO during the 15 minutes after the opening and 25 minutes before the close. We believe the price bands proposed by the exchanges will not fix anything. There is no need to have a quote 20% away from the NBBO. Simply allowing one-sided quotes that are within 5% of the NBBO is a better proposal.

4. Increase market maker requirements, including a minimal time for market makers to quote on the NBBO. There is currently an internal debate within the high frequency trading (HFT) community over increased obligations for market makers. Some larger HFTs are in favor of more obligations. These larger HFTs have recommended that market makers publish two-sided quotes that are at the inside of the NBBO for a minimum percentage of the day and have minimum size requirements. They also believe that market makers should provide 3-5 levels of price depth below the NBBO. In addition, the larger HFTs believe that market makers should have higher capital requirements. Some smaller HFTs have not supported these proposed obligations, however. They fear that the larger HFTs will be able to meet these obligations and, in return, the larger HFTs will receive advantages from the exchanges that market makers usually enjoy. According to these smaller HFTs, these advantages would include preferential access to the markets, lower fees and informational advantages. Smaller HFTs have warned that competition could be degraded and barriers to entry could be raised. We believe the SEC will side with the larger HFTs and impose their requested obligations.

In addition, we believe the SEC will signal that it will take action in the near future on four proposals that it already has recommended:

1. Flash Order Ban. After much public outrage more than a year ago, the SEC proposed banning flash orders. It has since published the proposal again for comment. In the meantime, flash orders are still being used by some exchanges.

2. Market Access Rule. Would require effective risk management controls for broker-dealers with access to markets, including those providing customers unfiltered or naked access to the markets.

3. Large Trader Reporting System. Would enhance regulators ability to identify large market participants, collect information on their trades, and analyze their activity.

 What Really Needs to Be Done 

Unfortunately, we have a crisis of confidence in our market structure. Until real and perceived inequalities and problems are rectified, that will continue to be the case, and we may continue to see investors flee. Investors want to know that another May 6th cannot happen again. They want to know that the market is fair and equal for all. And they want to know that the market is structured in a way such that pricing of assets reflects intrinsic values.

With that in mind, we believe the SEC staff should recommend much more substantive market reform. This is obviously a major undertaking that should be well thought out and careful attention needs to be paid to potential unintended consequences. Until then, we believe the following steps will help increase investor confidence and should be taken immediately:

1. Mandate Fiduciary Language for Exchanges and Brokers. Money managers have a legally binding duty to place all of their clients needs ahead of their own profitability. It seems appropriate that this obligation be extended to brokers and exchanges regulated by the SEC. An exchange that is handling a slower participants order would have the responsibility of protecting that orders intentions to the same degree it protects a more profitable participants (high volume/co-located) order.

2. Market Fragmentation. Do we need 10 exchanges and more than 40 dark pools? Is that desirable? What is the value added that each one brings to the investment community? Our regulators should institute a broad, yet meaningful standard, against which it weighs the approval of any new exchange or ATS. Deference should be given to the SECs stated mandate: To protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.

3. Order Cancellation Fee / Minimum Order Life. More than 90% of orders are cancelled. This potential overload of data to market centers is a clear systemic risk. Orders entered into the marketplace without the intention to trade threaten an orderly market. To control this risk, we would like to see a fee imposed on cancellations. In addition, we would like a minimum order duration of perhaps one second or at least long enough so that the markets slowest participant can still be afforded the opportunity to act on a quote.

4. Eliminate the Maker/Taker Model (pioneered by the Island ECN more than a decade ago). Maker rebates encourage volume for the sake of volume. This has generated high volume among the top 100 stocks, giving the illusion of a deep, liquid market. A good percentage of this volume is from firms engaged in rebate arbitrage, however. Rebate arbitrage is highly complex, involving the arbitraging of numerous trading destinations, each with separate incentives and rates, such that participating in that game has little economic relevance and congruence with trading and investing in general. The activity is price-agnostic. The successful playing of this game does not require buying low and selling higher, or vice versa. One of the criteria that many investment managers use when evaluating which securities to purchase is average daily volume (ADV). HFT hot potato volume is skewing the ADV statistics and could be distorting a key piece of information upon which many investors rely.

 Conclusion 

We believe that the intentions of the SEC staff are noble, but we know that it does not operate in a political vacuum. This is why we have laid out what we think it will recommend (with a glimmer of hope for something more substantive), while highlighting what we think the SEC really needs to do.

To regain public trust and confidence in our equity market, the SEC must undertake major reform. Such change faces two major challenges, however. It means admitting that the past decade of regulations have had serious unintended negative consequences. And it means going up against the HFT community, which is likely to do everything in its power to slow or water down the reform process.

The HFT community will claim that if any serious reform is implemented, they will be driven out of the market, spreads will increase and liquidity will dry up. We agree that spreads will widen, but liquidity will not vanish; only HFT volume will. And if a slightly wider spread is the cost of getting our market back into the hands of the owners who are responsible for price discovery, then that is a cost that most investors will gladly pay, we believe. While explicit costs will go up, the implicit costs of reduced market confidence will plummet.

Keeping proprietary trading going - but the question remains - how costly will the restrictions ultimately be on the non-bank, smaller shops?


 Mystery of Disappearing Proprietary Traders : Michael Lewis 
By Michael Lewis - Sep 29, 2010
 Bloomberg Opinion 

In the run-up to the vote on the financial overhaul bill, the big Wall Street banks squashed an attempt by Senator Carl Levin to pass a simple ban on any form of proprietary trading.

A Senate staffer close to the process told me the amendment was one of Wall Streets highest priorities, spreading money around to exert as much pressure as possible.

It worked: Levins amendment never reached the Senate floor for a vote. The final version of the bill restricts proprietary trading but allows big Wall Street firms to invest as much as 3 percent of their capital in their own internal hedge funds. How exactly the new rules are enforced is left to regulators inside the Federal Reserve, but its not hard to see how a wholly owned hedge fund might become a proprietary trading group, with a different name.

The 3 percent loophole amounted to an invitation for the big banks to keep on doing at least some of what they had been doing -- which is why Levin felt compelled to remove it, and the banks fought so hard to keep it.

Yet in just the past few weeks news has leaked that Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs all intend either to close their proprietary trading units or to sell their interests in the hedge funds they control.

Obviously, something is wrong with this picture. Why fight for a right, and win, only to proceed as if you have lost? Why take prisoners only to surrender to them? Having preserved their loophole the big American banks now appear to be freely abandoning any attempt to exploit it. (Credit Suisse, on the other hand, just bought a stake in a hedge fund.)

 Shark Watch 

To see Wall Street turn its back on money is as unsettling as watching a sharks fin veer away, and then sink from view. It leaves you wanting to know where the shark has gone, and why.

None of the firms have offered a good explanation for their new and seemingly improved behavior, but its not hard to think up several. From least plausible to most:

No. 1 -- Having not merely preserved but bolstered their place at the heart of capitalism -- with little banks failing everywhere, the big keep getting bigger and stronger -- the major Wall Street firms have experienced an epiphany about their relationship to wider society. They dont need to screw people!

Newly able to raise their prices, they want to return to serving their customers, rather than exploiting them.

Whatever they lose from prop trading they will be more than compensated for through new and more trusting relationships with their clients -- who will now have no reason to suspect they are merely a tool for the firms trading desk.

 Nice Guys 

In a smaller and less competitive financial industry, it will pay to be the nice guy, and so Goldman Sachs now wants to play nice.

The only problem with this explanation is that I dont believe it. More likely:

No. 2 -- The big Wall Street firms have looked anew at proprietary trading and seen a dying business.

For a start, their proprietary traders, put off by subpoenas and government inquiries and the new internal aversion to short-term pain on big trading positions, are fleeing for the privacy of hedge funds.

But the exodus of trading talent is only part of the problem. A general malaise has come over the world of big time financial risk taking. Everywhere you look hedge funds are either closing or shedding employees or, most shockingly, cutting their fees. At the bottom of this depressing new trend lies a deeper problem: a scarcity of suckers.

 Find the Fool 

The proprietary trading business turns in part on ones ability to find the fool -- to find people willing to take the stupid side of the smart bets you are placing. One of the side effects of our seemingly endless financial crisis is to wash a lot of fools, many of them German, out of the game.

Its as if a casino owner awakened one morning to find the tourists had all gone, and the only remaining patrons are pros counting cards at his blackjack tables. As he looked around his casino, for the first time in his life, he couldnt find the fool. And the first rule of the casino business is: if you dont know who the fool is, its probably you.

Prop trading isnt as promising as it used to be. At the same time its a far greater nuisance than it ever was: The regulators might actually be paying attention to what your traders get up to; if they screw up the financial press is poised to write a story about them; and so on.

 Not Worth It 

Its just not worth the trouble to prop trade, unless you can prop trade in some wholly novel way. Which brings us to a third possible explanation:

No. 3 -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are not in fact abandoning proprietary trading. They are just giving it a different name.

They are dismantling the units called proprietary trading and shifting the activity onto trading desks that deal directly with customers. (Which would explain why so few prop traders are being let go.)

After all, you dont need a proprietary trading desk to engage in the two activities that any proprietary trading ban would seek to prevent: 1) running huge trading risks, and 2) taking the other side of the customers stupid trades. Goldman Sachs infamous Abacus program -- the one that talked American International Group into selling vast amounts of cheap insurance to offset subprime mortgage risk, and then shorted the instruments they themselves had created -- wasnt dreamed up by the prop trading desk. It was the brainchild of what customers knew as the Client Facing Group.

In short, there are any number of explanations why Wall Street firms are all at once letting it be known they intend simply to walk away from what has been, until very recently, their single most lucrative line of work.

 None of the Above 

The answer may be none of the above or some mixture of the three. But whats really striking is how little ability the outside world retains to find out what is going on inside these places -- even after we have learned that what we dont know about them can kill us.

It would be nice to know, for instance, if the big banks are making these moves with the tacit understanding that the regulators, going forward, wont be looking too closely at the activities of the Client Facing Group.

And yet news of the death of the Wall Street prop trader has been greeted with hardly a peep. And I wonder: is this the nature of our new financial order? Big decisions, in which the public has a clear interest, being made outside public view, with little public discussion or understanding.

If so, it isnt a future at all. Its just the past, repeating itself.
