On this page, you&apos;ll discover what bargains await you inside the fortress-like walls of this attention-grabbing outlet mall on Interstate 5.

Citadel Outlet Mall overview
 Are you interested in grabbing some outlet mall bargains...but you don&apos;t want to leave the Los Angeles/Orange County core area? While most of the Southern California outlet malls are located on the fringes of greater Los Angeles and San Diego, there IS an outlet shopping opportunity in Commerce City, California...which is part of the main Los Angeles urban area.

 The Citadel Outlet Mall is its name...and you&apos;ll find it sitting very visibly at the side of Interstate 5 in Commerce City!

The Citadel Outlet Mall is not only &quot;visible,&quot; it&apos;s actually head-turning! The exterior of the Citadel Mall was created to look like the Babylonian palace of King Sargon II! The unusual Babylonian/Assyrian archetectural style was dreamed up by the owner of a tire-production company (first owner of this complex), and was built back in 1929. During its long history, this building was also used in the filming of the epic Hollywood movie, Ben Hur!

These days, the very interesting exterior wall remains intact...but the Citadel shopping area itself if new and modern. This Los Angeles outlet mall opened back in 1990, and continues to grow bigger and better as time marches onwards!

 THE CITADEL&apos;S NEW EXPANSION IS NOW OPEN! Many new outlet stores are now waiting for you to come check out their bargains...including Adidas, Aeropostale, Columbia Sportswear, Converse, DKNY, Esprit, Foreign Exchange clothing, The Gap, H&amp;M, Nike, O&apos;Neill and Under Armour...and more!
