 Best Breakfast Taco: TNT Restaurant/Tacos-N-Tamales 

Reyna Herrera declined to divulge ingredients and spices, but she said there is a reason her restaurant&apos;s breakfast tacos garner acclaim.

&quot;It&apos;s all about the flavor,&quot; Herrera, owner of TNT Restaurant/Tacos-N-Tamales, said.

&quot;We cook them right. You can make an egg, and I can make an egg, but I guarantee your egg is not going to taste as good as mine.&quot;

For the second year in a row, readers selected Herrera&apos;s restaurant as the best place for breakfast tacos.

To explain her success, Herrera pointed to fresh ingredients, homemade tortillas - each rolled daily by hand - and attention to detail.

The business, which began 18 years ago, also offers traditional Mexican meals, such as enchiladas, tamales and more.
