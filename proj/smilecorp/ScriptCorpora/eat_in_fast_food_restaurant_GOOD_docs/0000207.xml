What&apos;s it like to work at MacDonald&apos;s?
 Hey guys I&apos;m 17 years old and I wanna start working. I&apos;m planning to apply at MacDonalds because they hire ages 15 + and you don&apos;t need work experience. I&apos;m a guy and I would say I&apos;m pretty build for my age so that is what I&apos;m told. So will they make me do hard core stuff like heavy lifting. It&apos;s no problem but just wanted to know. Thanks in advance.

PS: I live Canada, Vancouver, Surrey, BC if it helps at all.

 Well, it depends on which position you work in.

If you work in the front, you will either be an order taker (cashier) or an order assembler (runner), or both, depending on the time and number of crew members. You will have to greet the customer, take the order and punch it into the cash (which is difficult at first, but you&apos;ll get the hang on it after a few shifts). If you are the order assembler, you will make all of the non-kitchen items (drinks, desserts, and fries) and place it on a tray or a take out bag. You will then give it to the customer and tell them to have a nice day. If you are doing both, you have to do all of those things and you are expected to do two orders at a time (so you take two orders before you go to assemble them).

If it is a larger location, you may be scheduled a fry shift (you cook and assemble all the fries for the orders) or a lobby shift (you clean the lobby).

If you work in the kitchen, which you likely will (for some reason McDonald&apos;s prefers to have men work in the kitchen and females work the cash) you will cook the meat and assemble the burgers. Working in the kitchen is really easy, I learned everything in two hours. Almost everything is a variation on the cheeseburger.

You may have to do some heavy lifting, but mostly there isn&apos;t to much. You might be asked to help put away brower (which is all the stuff they order for stock up) and some of the boxes can get kind of heavy.

 Working In McDonald, or anywhere is difficult at some part. But if you think your ready to have a job and its approved by your parents you should go for it. You&apos;ll have to work fast for example; a customer comes up to you saying&quot;I want a hot chocolate and large fries.&quot;You&apos;ll have to memorize the order numbers and quickly type it in the register/computer and tell the staff/chief to send the order. Then you have to hand in the order to the customer and say&quot;Have a nice day.&quot;Since its a fast food restaurant everything needs to be done fast. You&apos;ll earn good money as well, and enjoy your job of serving the community. I think you should go for it, since your 17 and you&apos;re pretty build for your age you should apply. Good Luck! : )
