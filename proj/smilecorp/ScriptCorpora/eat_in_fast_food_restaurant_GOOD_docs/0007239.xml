 Tweet Went in advance auto parts a couple of weeks ago and purchased there silver brand battery around 75.00 dollars.I knew the guy who looked up battery for me on their computer for model type for my truck.After i purchased battery i asked him to install it for me[my truck].They do this for you when you buy a battery from them.Anyways the guy goes and starts taking mine old battery out and puts in new one and hooks the new one backwards [neg to pos ][pos to neg].my wires start smoking by the battery.He switched them back correctly but to late.Nothing worked in my truck.End up having to call wife to come and get me.They sent my truck to a lame repair shop the next day.Totally fired almost every thing in my truck.The shop mechanic done very sorry work on it and tried to give back to me with nothing working on the inside of my truck at all.gauge cluster, radio, cruise control etc.I ended up having to take it my self to the dealer ship for repairs.They are paying for all the repairs[Advance auto parts insurance].BOTTOM LINE THEY NEED QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO INSTALL A BATTERY.COMMON SENSE 101.HOW HARD COULD IT BE.BEWARE IF THEY DO THIS FOR YOU!!!
