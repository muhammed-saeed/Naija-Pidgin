 So natural 
 
 Nicole Kidman enjoys her role as a mother so much that she&apos;s even happy to take her baby to work with her. But of course it&apos;s no ordinary existence.

The Oscar winner shared the spotlight with her baby girl Faith on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar Australia‘s June/July issue which is out next week.

Looking every inch her mother&apos;s daughter, Faith who was pictured in little more than a nappy, showed off a matching shock of strawberry blonde hair.

 Wow! 
 She announced one month ago that she is pregnant with her second child.

But Adriana Lima tonight showed she won’t be ditching glamorous red carpet fashion for typical maternity wear any time soon.

The Victoria’s Secret Angel showed off her baby bump in a figure-hugging black dress as she attended the opening of the IWC flagship store in New York City.
But her blossoming bump wasn’t the only thing 30-year-old Adriana was showing off as she also flaunted her toned legs in the very short frock.

The dress had a beaded neckline and the Brazilian beauty accessorised with a large watch, black pumps and a miniature clutch bag.

While Adriana stole the spotlight at the store opening, there was lots of eye candy on hand for the female guests at the watch brand’s launch.
Hollywood hunks Chris Hemsworth, Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello were all in attendance, dressed to impress in suave suits.

The dapper men all posed arm in arm as they arrived on the red carpet outside the Big Apple shop.

Victoria’s Secret model Karolina Kurkova also turned up, looking stylish in a fitted white boiler suit as she posed up with her fellow Angel Adriana.  Daily Mail Posted by Ivana

 Uh, Kavali... 
 Roberto Kavali uspeo je da se svojim komentarom uvredi Anu Vintur, urednicu američkog &quot;Voga&quot; sa kultnim statusom u celoj industriji.

U intervjuu koji je dao za italijansko internet izdanje magazina &quot;D.La Repubblica&quot; Roberto Kvali bio je upitan kakav bi savet dao mladim dizajnerima, na početku karijere. On je prvo istakao da moraju da stvore svoj jedinstven i prepoznatljiv pravac, a zatim osuo paljbu po ženi od koje zazire čitava modna industrija, Ani Vintur.
 
&quot;Pogledajte samo američku modu, koja skoro da jeste moda. Užasna je i čovek to jedva da može da gleda očima, ali tu i takvu modu gura velika novinarka Ana Vintur, koja želi da sve žene budu poput nje i da se oblače onako kako se ona oblači&quot;, kazao je Kavali.

Oči čitave modne javnosti sada su uprte u Vinturovu i njenu reakciju na ovakvu izjavu italijanskog dizajnera.  Blic Posted by Ivana

 Getting rid of SWEET habit! 
 Most of the choices we make each day—from the way we tie our shoes and brush our teeth, to the route we take to work and the coffee we buy when we arrive there—may feel like the products of well-considered decision-making but, in reality, they are habits.

In fact, research has shown that more than 40 per cent of the daily actions we perform aren’t conscious decisions.

And even though each habit means little on its own, over time the snacks we eat, whether we smoke, drink, exercise, spend or save, as well as our work routines have a huge impact on our productivity, financial security, health and happiness.
But while most of the time we know if we’ve developed a bad habit, it can prove almost impossible to break. No matter how many times you say you’ll give up smoking tomorrow or even just skip that afternoon chocolate bar, when it comes to the crunch, good intentions fly out of the window.

However, it doesn’t need to be like that, says investigative reporter Charles Duhigg. His new book The Power Of Habit: Why We Do What We Do And How To Change promises to be the key to help us break our bad behaviour patterns.

Duhigg uses the example of a 34-year-old woman called Lisa Allen, who had been smoking and drinking since she was 16 and had struggled with obesity for most of her life. In her 20s, she’d amassed£7,500 in debts and her longest job had lasted less than a year.
Charles Duhigg&apos;s new book promises to be the key to help us break our bad behaviour patterns

Three years later, however, she’d given up cigarettes and alcohol, lost more than 4st and run a marathon. She’d also begun a masters degree and bought a home. So, how had she managed to change her life in such a short space of time? Incredibly, reveals Duhigg, it all began with her deciding to drop just one of her bad habits—smoking.

Lisa’s marriage had broken down and, after much wallowing, she booked a flight to Cairo, a city she’d always wanted to visit. While in Egypt, she decided she wanted to go trekking, but was seriously out of shape. So Lisa vowed to give herself a year to prepare—a year in which she would need to give up smoking to be healthier.

Over the next six months, Lisa replaced smoking with jogging. In turn, this simple change altered how she ate, work and slept. That small decision in Cairo—the conviction that she had to give up smoking to accomplish her goal—had sparked off a series of changes that radiated to other parts of her life.

When scientists studied her brain in a series of scans, they found something remarkable. One set of neurological patterns—her old habits—was being overridden by new patterns. The researchers could still see the neural activity of her old behaviours, but those impulses were being pushed out by the new urges. As Lisa’s habits were changing, so was the physiology of her brain. Lisa’s scans showed she hadn’t lost the urge to overeat. When her eyes saw food, the areas in the brain that control cravings and hunger still responded. But over the year, activity in the area where self-discipline starts had become more active. All of which means that, like Lisa, it is possible for us to learn how to banish bad habits.  HOW HABITS ARE FORMED

They emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort, say scientists. Our brain converts sequences of actions into automatic routines, known as‘chunking’. This process is at the root of how habits form. We rely on dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioural chunks every day. Some are simple: squeezing toothpaste on to a brush before putting it into your mouth. Others, such as making lunch, are a little more complex.   THE THREE-STEP LOOP

Habits are created by a three-step process or‘loop’. First comes a trigger that cues the brain to go into automatic mode to choose which habit to use—anything from a smell, a place, a time of day, an emotion, or the company of certain people can start it off.

Next comes the routine. It can be something physical, mental or emotional, and range from an extremely simple action to something complex, from eating, drinking or smoking to putting on the kettle. Finally, there comes a reward that helps the brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. This could be the feeling that alcohol, food or nicotine induces, or an emotional pay-off, such as a sense of pride or achievement.

Over time, this loop—cue-routine-reward—becomes increasingly automatic, and the cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation emerges. Just the sight of cigarettes, for example, is enough for the brain to crave a nicotine rush. If it doesn’t arrive, the craving grows, until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a cigarette.  GOOD AND BAD HABITS ARE EQUAL

Habits never really disappear—they are encoded into the structures of our brain. Once we develop a habit of opening a bottle of wine when the children go to bed or snacking on biscuits mid-afternoon, those patterns always remain inside our heads. So far as the brain is concerned, it doesn’t matter if these habits are good for us or bad. In fact, it can’t tell the difference. All that matters is that a loop of behaviour has been formed that brings a reliable reward.

By the same rule, however, if we learn to create new neurological routines to replace unhelpful behaviours—if we take control of the habit loop—we can force those bad tendencies into the background, just as Lisa Allen did after her trip to Cairo.Once someone replaces a bad pattern with a good pattern, studies show the healthy habit—be it drinking tea instead of wine or rejecting the biscuits—can become as automatic as any other habit.  HABITS ARE POWERFUL BUT DELICATE

Studies indicate that families don’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. But driving home after a long day when the children are starving, it’s tempting to stop at McDonald’s or Burger King‘just this once’. But what happens is that this behaviour slowly becomes once a week, then twice a week—until a family is consuming an unhealthy amount of fast food.

When researchers tried to understand families’behaviour, they found a series of cues and rewards. Every branch of McDonald’s, for instance, looks the same—it deliberately tries to standardise the architecture and what employees say to customers so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines. Even these powerful habits are delicate, though. When a fast food restaurant closes down, disrupting the habit loops of its customers, families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home.  
  CREATING A NEW CRAVING

If you want to develop a new, positive habit, perhaps running each morning, it’s essential you choose a simple cue—such as leaving your trainers and running clothes next to the bed the night before. You also need a clear reward—perhaps charting how far you have run or luxuriating in the shower as the neurochemicals released by exercise flood your body with wellbeing. But studies have also shown that cues and rewards on their own aren’t enough for new habits to last.

Only when your brain starts expecting the reward—craving the endorphins or the sense of accomplishment—will it become a habit to lace up your trainers each morning. In other words, as well as triggering a routine, the cue must also create an expectation of a reward.

To kick-start the process, you can bolt on an even more attractive reward: a small piece of chocolate or a big breakfast when you finish your run. Extra food might seem a counterproductive reward for exercise if your aim is to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a cue (running gear by the bed) with a routine (going out for a run) and a reward (chocolate!). In time—maybe weeks, maybe months—your brain will so closely associate exercise with a sense of reward that you won’t need the chocolate; it will just focus on the feelgood neurochemicals released by exercise.  LEARNING A NEW LOOP

We can learn new habits but we can never truly extinguish the old ones. To change a habit, you must strive to replicate the good feelings you get from bad patterns by swapping the bad pattern with a good one. For example, Alcoholics Anonymous asks alcoholics to identify the rewards they get from drinking—it’s often escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties and emotional release. The physical effects of drinking are usually far down the list.

In order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a pub, AA builds a series of meetings and companionship to offer as much escape, distraction and catharsis as a night out drinking would. It creates new patterns for what to do each night instead of hitting the bottle, inserting new routines into old habit loops.

So, if you want to stop eating biscuits in the afternoon, identify your cue and your reward. Is the reward you are seeking to satisfy hunger? Or is it actually to alleviate boredom? If the latter, you can easily find another routine, such as taking a quick walk or seeking out a colleague for a chat.
Change can happen. Alcoholics can stop drinking, smokers can stop puffing, you can stop biting your nails or eating biscuits every afternoon. But there’s one more vital ingredient in changing a habit—belief. For habits to permanently change, we must believe that long-term change is possible.

 Da li koristim twitter? Odgovor je DA! 
 U svetu gde je trenutna informacija apsolutni hit i gde je senzacija takođe bitan deo dana imati twitter je u neku (čitaj ipak svaku) ruku prednost. Ostavićemo za trenutak poslovni i obrazovni aspekt na stranu–razloge zbog kojih se uglavnom socijalne mreže podržavaju, ali i veoma lako opravdavaju. Bacimo se na aspekt novosti.
Svedok ste da jednu istu vest prenosi dnevno više stanica, medijskih kuća…Svi na svoj način. Tu opet postoji jedna od kojih sve kreće. Za naše dnevne vesti u Srbiji glavni izvori su npr. Daily Mail, US today, Just Jared i ostali jako apdejtovani sajtovi o svetu show biznisa, sporta, politike, kulture…Međutim, i iza njih stoji neko, a ime mu je twitter. Danas, ako neko kao npr. top celebrity, socialite ili čak lokalni političar želi da iznese svoj stav, prikaže gde je i šta radi, ostvari sebi trenutnu popularnost i da mu par reči ODMAH obidju svet, uradiće to preko ove mreže. U svakom slučaju prednost je što ste vi, samim tim što ste follower neke od gore pomenutih‘kategorija apsolutno informisani, te ne morate sutra u vestima da čujete to isto samo prevedeno ili prilagođeno ili da gubite vreme na razne članke novinara–adaptera–prevodioca. Dakle, twitter u ruke i uzivajte… Twitter i njegovi servisi mogu se vrlo interesantno koristiti i u poslovnom okruženju, kao i iskoristiti za različite pristupe u pogledu promocije, marketinga, odnosa sa klijentima i to sve u okviru dozvoljenih 140 karaktera. Veoma je bitno da se pojavite, registrujete i da taj servis svakodnevno koristite. Postoje pojedinci, firme…koji iz znatiželje pokrenu twitter ili facebook nalog, a onda ga zaborave. To vama ne sme da se dogodi! Socijalne mreže služe za povezivanje, komunikaciju i kontakte, ali STALNE, ne povremene. Dakle, u poslovne i profesionalne svrhe umrežite se sa ljudima iz struke, menjajte mišljenja, učestvujte na forumima, dajte savete, tražite savete, povežite vaš twitter sa facebook profilom i na kraju budite malo i intrigantni. Ne očekujete istu reakciju ako npr. Adriana Lima ili Rihanna tvituju svoju sliku sa novom frizurom ili u provokativnoj pozi i kada npr snime nebo tog jutra nad LA-om. Tako i vi. Nije isto ako ste svojim komentarima’mlaki’i’nevidljivi’i ako vaše reči odzvone i za vas se čuje. Gradite svoju reputaciju na socijalnim mrežama baš kao i vaš lični i individualni profil i kredibilitet. Najbolja stvar u svemu ovome je što su twitter i facebook besplatni i dostupni.
Dakle, nema press konferencija, nema saopštenja. Uključite twitter i poslujte, edukujte se, zabavite i budite prvi obavešteni!

 You are what you buy! 
 If you had $100 left in your wallet, would you go to dinner with friends or buy a new dress from H&amp;M?

How you answered could define your happiness, your likability, and your overall outlook on life.

Two recent studies have come up against the old adage &apos;money can&apos;t buy happiness&apos;, concluding that materialistic buyers were less happy, and even less liked, than experiential spenders.

People generally believe that being able to purchase material possessions will improve their lives.

However, psychological research suggests that people who spend money on travel, food and other cultural experiences were able to get along better with others, feel less anxiety in social situations and had a greater overall well-being than those who spent their money on a pair of this season&apos;s shoes.

Nearly 10,000 people answered online questionnaires about their personality and purchasing habits in a study conducted by researchers at San Francisco State University.
The results were published this January in the Journal of Positive Psychology, where researchers calculated that an &apos;experience shopper&apos; had greater overall life satisfaction than a material consumer.

One of the reasons for increased happiness for experiential spenders, is that they are risk takers, said Ryan Howell, an assistant professor at San Francisco State and the study’s lead researcher.

&apos;You are taking a bigger risk on a night at a new restaurant or play,&apos; he said. &apos;You can’t return a trip or a meal the way you can return something from a store.&apos;

Another reason, the researchers found, was that people felt a greater sense of vitality or &apos;being alive&apos; during the experience and then later, in reflection, Howell said.
&apos;As nice as your new computer is, it&apos;s not going to make you feel alive,&apos; he said.

The initial joy of acquiring a new object, such as a new outfit, fades over time after the person becomes accustomed to seeing it every day, experts said.

Experiences, on the other hand, continue to provide happiness through memories long after the event occurred.

Researchers believe their findings will be helpful in making people who naturally find themselves drawn to material purchases more aware that life satisfaction and happiness can be influenced by their spending habits.

This study reflected similar findings by researchers at the University of Colorado who found that materialistic buyers were less well-liked by their peers than experiential buyers were.

Published in 2010 in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, participants expressed negative stereotypes of materialistic people, considering them to be more selfish and self-centered than experiential people.

While these impressions were mostly attributed to the inherent reputation of materialistic people, rather than an admiration for experiential people, participants said they found the experiential shoppers more charismatic and wanted to spend time with them.

By comparison, they found the materialistic shoppers shallow.

The stigma of materialism also led participants to dislike discussions based on materialistic, rather than experiential, purchases.

Experts also point out that people are less self-conscious when comparing experiences than they are when sharing stories of material possessions.

It will probably bother you more that your friend bought the latest Prada heels you have been coveting, than if she saw more historic and grand sights on her trip to India. You would probably like her more for it, too.  Daily Mail Posted by Ivana

 Looking at

Is it the desire to own every scrap of silk and lace in the masterful

star of the collection&apos;s campaign, American model Le Call?

Whichever it is, it&apos;s fair to say that the seductive spring/summer 
campaign is a roaring success.

The 30-year-old model showcases the &apos;flirty and feminine&apos; new 
collection, which is a symphony of luxurious silks and French leavers 
lace in delicate hues of pearl grey and shell, shot through with vibrant
 spice and sultry damson.

 Little Jackson is the coolest kid ever :) 
 &apos;He is the coolest kid ever&apos;: Charlize Theron opens up on adopted baby Jackson as she graces the cover of Vogue
She surprised her fans with the unexpected announcement last month that she had adopted a baby boy.

But Charlize Theron has revealed that becoming a mother was something she had been planning for some time.

Speaking to the May issue of Vogue, the 36-year-old says: &apos;I’ve always been very honest in saying I wanted a family. I’ve always known I wanted a family.&apos;

Admitting that she felt under the same pressure as so many daughters, Charlize revealed: &apos;I don’t think my mom could wait any more!

&apos;Jackson is incredible, the greatest gift,&apos; she added. &apos;He is the coolest kid ever.&apos;

Theron released a statement three weeks ago announcing that she had become the proud mother of a &apos;healthy baby boy.&apos;
Asked what kind of mother she hopes to be, Charlize looked to her own beloved mother Gerda, whom she is incredibly close to, as her guide.

&apos;I hope to be like my mom,&apos; she told the magazine. &apos;Fair, tough, loving and supportive. My mom has made it possible for me to be who I am. Our family is everything. Her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence.&apos;
Vogue

Charlize to oozes a high-glamour, Mad Men vibe on the cover of Vogue.

With perfectly groomed hair and wearing an ice blue gown, the stunning actress emits a Grace Kelly-esque aloof allure.

Inside, the Prometheus star reclines luxuriantly on a bed wearing a pink gown with a plunging neckline, in beautiful, ethereal shots taken by esteemed photographer Patrick Demarchelier.

Modelling comes naturally to the blonde beauty, but Charlize says her career in that field never took off because she was born a decade too late.

&apos;I was too tall, too big, too late for the supermodel look of the Eighties. Kate Moss and all the tiny, grungy girls had just become fashionable, and I didn’t fit the bill.&apos;

&apos;I’m sure there are women who never have to worry about what they eat. But I do. I exercise a lot, and I hike a lot. My mom and I hike at least three times a week.&apos;

To read the full feature, buy the May issue of Vogue, on sale from Monday 9th April.  Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2125388/Charlize-Theron-opens-adopted-baby-Jackson-graces-cover-Vogue.html#ixzz1rALrYJhw Posted by Ivana

 Google googles 
 Google goggles are here! Watch video of the mind-boggling techno-glasses which layer Maps, email and web searches OVER your view of the world Google has taken the wraps off techno-glasses which add emails, Google searches and even directions over your view of the world.

The glasses - unveiled via a Google Plus page, Project Glass, are voice-controlled, and offer GPS directions as well as email and video chat through a built-in screen directly in front of a user&apos;s eyes.

The glasses are a product of Google&apos;s &apos;Google X&apos; blue-sky ideas lab - and the search giant is looking for ideas to improve them.

&apos;We think technology should work for you—to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t,&apos; says Google.

The glasses appear to run a variant of the Android operating system, using the same microphone icon and other recognisable parts of Google&apos;s mobile OS.

The glasses layer information &apos;over&apos; the world, and offer directions - as well as allowing users to &apos;locate&apos; one another in the real world, as with Google&apos;s current Latitude system.

 It`s a boy for Ambrosio! 
 She managed to keep her pregnancy a secret in the early stages even taking to the catwalk in her underwear.

But it appears Alessandra Ambrosio hasn’t been able to be so covert when it came to the sex of her unborn child and the model has revealed she is expecting a baby boy.

The Brazilian model, 30, took to Facebook to let her fans know the news posting a picture of herself lying on a beach next to the words‘IT’S A BOY’written in the sand.  Daily Mail Posted by Ivana

 Split after full two years 
 Adam Levine and Anne V have split up, it has been confirmed.

The Maroon 5 singer and Victoria&apos;s Secret model had been dating for two years.

A spokesman for the 26-year-old beauty, full name Anne Vyalitsyna, confirmed the news in a statement.
It&apos;s over: Adam Levine and model Anne V have split up after two years together, seen here last November together at the Victoria&apos;s Secret Fashion Show in NYC

It&apos;s over: Adam Levine and model Anne V have split up after two years together, seen here last November together at the Victoria&apos;s Secret Fashion Show in NYC

Anne told People magazine: &apos;Adam and I have decided to separate in an amicable and supportive manner.

&apos;We still love and respect each other as friends. I wish him all the best.&apos;

Russian-born Anne met 33-year-old Levine - who is a judge on singing talent show The Voice - at the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue release party in Las Vegas in early 2010.

Maroon 5 performed at the event but didn&apos;t immediately hit it off.
Keeping things amicable: Anne said in her statement, &apos;we still love and support each other,&apos; pictured here at the Grammy Awards in February

Anne previously said: &apos;He thought I was a stuck-up bitch and I kind of thought he was a d*****bag musician.&apos;

Although the couple were rumoured to have had a giant bust up earlier this year, speaking in February, Adam said he was determined to make the relationship work.

He explained: &apos;This is the most functional relationship I&apos;ve ever been in. I don&apos;t want to screw it up.&apos;

Adam previously dated celebrities including Jessica Simpson, Maria Sharapova and Cameron Diaz.
Career high: Levine is currently appearing on the second season of The Voice in the U.S. as judge

He had a four-year relationship with former Vogue editor Jane Herman after meeting in high school and detailed his heartbreak over their split in Maroon 5&apos;s 2002 debut album Songs About Jane.

Last November Adam serenaded Anne on stage during the Victoria&apos;s Secret Fashion Show in New York.

As well as her work for the lingerie brand, Anne has also posed for eight consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues.

In November she posed nude on the cover of Vogue Russia along with Levine. Posted by Ivana

 Konstantin sa Novakom 
 Veliki projekat koji će se ovog leta snimati u Americi i Srbiji, film o životu Konstantina Velikog, trebalo bi da premijerno bude prikazan 2013. godine. Ovih dana je dogovoreno da i naš najbolji teniser Novak Đoković igra u tom projektu.
Novaku Đokoviću ovo neće biti prvi put da je stao pred filmske kamere. Film će obeležiti godišnjicu Milanskog edikta, dokumenta kojim je ozvaničeno hrišćanstvo kao religija u Evropi 413. godine, a koji je potpisao Konstantin Veliki. Manje poznata činjenica za ljude iz sveta je da je Konstantin Veliki rođen u Nišu, te da je veći deo svog života živeo u Srbiji.


Produkcija„Drimvej“Miška Mitića i Džoela Mongomerija će tokom ovogodišnjeg Festivala u Kanu zvanično najaviti projekat i objaviti punu kasting listu. Nedavno je objavljeno da će izvršni producent filma biti slavni Lukas Foster. Iz izvora bliskih produkciji filma„Konstantin Veliki“, Novak je pristao na veću ulogu u projektu.


Kako„Blic“saznaje, prvi teniser sveta će imati zahtevniju ulogu nego što je imao u„Plaćenicima 2“. On će svoju veštinu baratanja teniskim raketom zameniti veštinom mačevanja, najverovatnije u ulozi generala vojske Konstantina Velikog.

 

Kako se radi o obimnoj produkciji na velikom broju lokacija, ostaje da se usaglase termini između Novakovih agenata i produkcije. Novak je u nekoliko navrata napomenuo da mu je zanimljivo da se upusti u projekte koji imaju veze sa glumom.


- Snimajući u Bugarskoj sa Staloneom i ekipom, doživeo sam neverovatno iskustvo. Tu premijeru sledećeg leta s nestrpljenjem isčekujem. Bilo je to sjajno iskustvo.


Takođe, u Nišu je planirano je da se uradi još jedan projekat o ovoj značajnoj istorijskoj ličnosti i najverovatnije će se snimati film po romanu„Konstantinovo raskršće“.


Inače, Foster je poznat po filmovima„Gospodina i gospođa Smit“kao i serijalu„Bad Boys“.  Blic Posted by Ivana

 The Star 
 The stars of world wrestling were 
here this weekend and, who knows, if Novak Djokovic took them on he 
might prove too strong for all-comers in the ring as well as on the 
court. The world No 1 
remains impregnable when it matters most and was certainly more than a 
match for Andy Murray in Sunday&apos;s final of the Sony Ericsson Open, 
warding off a second-set charge from the 24-year-old Scot to beat him 
6-1, 7-6. It appeared 
that after a curious 10 days in which he was given not one but two 
walkovers, courtesy of injured opponents, Murray had mislaid his 
momentum. And by the time he showed signs of rediscovering some forward 
motion it was too late.  Daily Mail

 Pamela found Bobby Ewing in her shower on Dallas, explaining his

stunned by the show&apos;s cheeky twist. And
 now ahead of the show&apos;s return this summer, Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and 
his new and old co-stars have posed up in a hilarious new promotional 
picture for the series - showing them all wearing towels in the shower.

 Duran Duran definitivno u Srbiji 12.jula! :) 
 Kao što je„Blic“ekskluzivno objavio,„Djuran Djuran“dolaze u Srbiju, gde će nastupati na Egzitu, potvrdili su organizatori našeg najvećeg festivala. Čuvena pop grupa koja je pokorila svet osamdesetih i devedesetih godina, dolazi u Srbiju kako bi promovisala poslednji album„All You Need Is Now“.
 Biće to njihov drugi nastup pred srpskom publikom. Oni su na Sajmu u Beogradu nastupali 2006. godine, a ostaće upamćeno i to da su bukvalno potopili splav na kojem je održana žurka posle njihovog nastupa.
Naime, momci predvođeni Sajmonom Le Bonom otišli su sa organizatorom Rakom Marićem na splav“Lim lajt”(današnji„Heaven“). Među zvanicama su bili i Bregović, Stefan Kapičić i Miranda Viđak, Tijana Dapčević, Frano Lasić, ali i još 1.500 ljudi koji su bili preveliko opterećenje za splav koji je počeo da tone.
Prvo su hitno sklonjeni članovi grupe“Djuran Djuran”, pa su za njima polako izašli i svi ostali gosti. Splav je iste večeri potpuno potonuo.
Novi album, pod producentskom palicom dobitnika Gremi nagrade Marka Ronsona, kao i miksera Spajka Stenta, zvukom vraća na sam početak koji je i definisao najvažnije dane benda.

http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/2012/a-note-about-duran-duran-tour-dates/

Singl„All You Need Is Now“i nedavno objavljen spot za pesmu„Girl Panic!“, u kojem se pojavljuju supermodeli Naomi Kembel, Jasmin Le Bon, Eva Hercigova i Sindi Kraford opravdavaju„Djuran Djuran“na prestolu svetskih muzičkih inovacija.
- Naša prva dva albuma sv i su smatrali futurističkim i modernim. Mark je doneo taj element rizika i oštrine našoj muzici tada, i opet je uspeo da to uradi za nas.
Nema potrebe da ja pišem muziku. Ako ja pevam, a momci sviraju, to će zvučati kao„Djuran Djuran“.
Uvek sam govorio:„Nikada ne mogu da me izbace iz benda jer nikada neće zvučati isto bez mog glasa“- kroz šalu je ispričao Sajmon promovišući novi album.
On sam je okarakterisao nove pesme kao„nešto dobro i staro“, što je bend radio ranije, a i kritika se slaže.
Neki su čak otišli toliko daleko da su ovaj album proglasili njihovim najboljim radom.
Kada dođe do brojki, sve čime„Djuran Djuran“može da se pohvali je i te kako impozantno. Imaju više od 100 miliona prodatih ploča, 18 američkih hit singlova, 30 hitova na britanskoj top-listi...
 

Bend je osnovan 1978. godine. Originalna postava je ostala zajedno

do 1985. godine, a danas im fali samo gitarista Endi Tejlor, koji se nakratko vratio u bend i onda opet odustao od„Djuran Djurana“2006. godine.
 

Na poslednjem koncertu koji su održali prošle nedelje u Australiji, bend je nastup otpočeo numerom sa poslednjeg albuma, ali su zato odmah posle toga odsvirali„View To Kill“. Usledili su prepoznatljivi hitovi„Come Undone“,„Ordinary World“,„Hungry Like The Wolf“,„Sunrise“,„Wild Boys“, The Reflex“...
