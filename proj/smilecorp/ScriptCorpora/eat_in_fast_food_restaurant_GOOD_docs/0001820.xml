Why do we tip staff in certain professional services, but not others?
 Are Canadians confused about tipping? While most Canadians are happy to tip the standard 15 per cent at a restaurant, it seems they are far less gracious when it comes to tipping staff in other service jobs, according to a new survey.

 Tipping is not only out of control in Canada, but it plays right into the hand of employers with long pockets and short arms. What&apos;s the reason we would tip a Starbucks barista and not an IGA bagger? It&apos;s because Starbucks had the balls to put a&quot;karma cup&quot;out. I feel no obligation to help out the Starbucks corporation financially by supplementing the salary of their employees. I thank them, as they should also thank me - for providing the customer base that ensures they continue to have jobs. That&apos;s my piece on that.

 yumadonn… In Canada, no one works for less than minimum wage,. If you do, you are quite stupid. Don&apos;t expect the public to make up the rest of your wage!

 mahonmac… Tipping is NOT a&quot;government invention.&quot;Some gratuities date back MILLENIA. In ancient Greek legends, visitors to Hades tipped Charon for ferrying them across the river Styx. In Medieval England, convicted nobles tipped the headsman to&quot;make sure his axe struck clean&quot;to minimise their suffering.

 Bored Why are waiters being paid less than minimum wage? Poor restaurant owners should be helped out too. How about we bring our own meat and vegetables to the restaurants, so we reduce the cost to the owners to the minimum, since they are already too streched out by paying their staff low wages ets?

 -=Loveis… I wish I had found this when it was active! There are so many jobs out there that are minimum wage that never see a tip why some get tips and others do not is beyond me. Everybody should do there job to the best of their ability and the employer should be giving them a fair wage!

 Uh, this is such a pointless issue. There is no law that states a tip must be issued equal to the amount of tax. And there shouldn&apos;t be a law like that EVER. The whole 15% bs tip was made by the government so the underpaid service staff would think the government cared about their wages. Why are customers expected and sometimes forced to pay a tip? We&apos;re not their employers. Their managers and owners are their employers and they pay their employees, that&apos;s the system. Tips are no where stated under the human rights code. So f*** those restaurants where they automatically include a tip on my bill. I worked at Tim Hortons for crying outloud, if anybody should get a tip it should be us working at McDonalds and Burger King and any bloody place where we gotta serve the bitchiest customers under a racist boss. When will people just quit complaining about stupid problems. You work at a job which has a minimum wage implemented by law. If you are underpaid, go complain to higher authorities, I support you 100%. If you get paid minimum wage...whoopie, dont expect a tip from me just cause you brought me my 1/4 chicken breast with fries from Swiss Chalet.

 Aside from the hospitality industry where most of us know the wait staff only makes minimum wage, the rest is a bit of a shot in the dark.

It would be nice to find a list of service jobs in Canada complete with the strandard percentage appropriate to tip as a guide for the average Canadian as well as tourists. If there is such a list in existance, I would certainly like to know where it may be found.

But I would also be interested to know how much money in wages these various service jobs pay. That would make a difference in most of us feeling willing to deburse more money for the service in the first place.

 I always tip anywhere from 10 % (for poor service) to 30 % (for great service). Most people in the service industry (especially those who work in restaurants and bars) make less than standard minimum wage, which is called service wage, because it&apos;s assumed that the rest of their income is made from gratuities. I&apos;m always sure to tip my hair stylist (as well as the woman who shampoos my hair), cab driver, newspaper delivery person and anyone who serves me at a restaurant or bar at least fifteen per cent and, if I&apos;m really happy with the service and feel that I&apos;ve received extra attention, anywhere from 25 to 30 per cent. It makes me feel good to reward someone for a job well done, and always ensures the same, if not better, attention and service the next time I&apos;m waited on or driven home by (let alone entrust my hair to) that same person. Most servers have to tip out their bartenders, the kitchen staff and sometimes management, and I know, from past experience as a waitress, how awful it feels to be undertipped, not tipped at all, or have a walk-out (which most wait staff have to pay for from their own pockets). So when you refuse to leave a gratuity, it ends up costing the server his/her own hard-earned dollars to actually wait on you, and that&apos;s just unfair. The few times I&apos;ve felt that the service I&apos;ve received was under-par enough to make a statement, I&apos;ve tipped my server and hairstylist ten per cent, then brought my dissatisfaction to their attention. Three out of four complaints were greeted with profuse apologies, and I&apos;m very sure those servers will remember me the next time I come in, and dote on me. On the one occasion where I was really unhappy with a stylist, and told her that she hadn&apos;t done what I had asked her to, she copped a huge attitude and told me that she knew what she was doing, and that I had no business questioning her. In that case, I went to her employer and lodged a formal complaint, more for the way I was treated than the service I received.
Mediocre service is not okay, but as long as you&apos;re properly acknowledged, served in a timely manner and never disrespected, your driver/server/stylist deserves the standard 15 %. If the service is great, and the service provider is friendly, attentive and helpful, be generous, as it will ensure that you&apos;re remembered the next time.

 Tipping or gratuities should most certainly NOT be automatically added to the bill at a restaurant, but should be a person&apos;s choice depending on the quality of the food and service provided.

The really unfortunate thing is that WITHOUT tips many of the bartenders, wait-staff, etc. are making below minimum wage (which as it stands is a poverty wage) so they come to really rely upon being tipped in order to at least bring them in line with what the girl pouring coffee at Tim Horton&apos;s makes per hour.

What we really NEED to do is to kill that BS clause that allows employers to pay people below the minimum wage, so that these people DO NOT have to rely on the generosity of the establishment&apos;s patrons (who may be suffering their own financial hardships). And we should also call for a $10 an hour minimum wage for all Canadians.

 To answer to the question,&quot;Why tip in one industry and not as much or not at all in another industry?&quot;I would suggest it is because of evolution. When tipping was first introduced it was performed at the beginning of the evening and it was to ensure proper service. Much like a bribe, I digress. It was a sign of stature to be seated at preferred areas or experience exeptional treatment. It has sinced morphed into what we see and feel today. I just asked my fiancee if she would tip the lawn guy (if we had one) and she said probably at the end of the summer! I fell out of my chair. As I write this from the floor I find myself asking what compells people to do that? She couldn&apos;t tell me. I think it&apos;s to make sure the lawn guy knows we have so much money we can give it away. She&apos;s being the kind sweet soul I love. I digress.

I think that I tip because I feel obligated but I tip well because it makes me feel good that I had Great service. I used to work in the service industry as a dishwasher *dish pig* as we were referred to in the industry and I was at the bottom of the pole with more intelligence and charisma than most on the floor, I digress. I got tipped out from the wait staff none the less. Believe me getting $5.95/hr plus you keep what&apos;s left from your tip outs is better than getting straight min. wage. That being said it sucks that salespeople and yes that&apos;s what a bartender, server, cabbie, hair dresser, ect are... they all sell some form of service ...it sucks that they have absolutely no stability in the sense they rarle have benefits, pension, group RRSP&lt;--- although more employers are catching on to this one, no job security.

Uh oh My fiancee now wants to go to McDonald&apos;s so I&apos;m cutting this short. Good luck, stop tipping, pay everyone fairly and pass the cost on to the customer (we&apos;re paying it anyway). I hope we go through the drive through and use Interac so we can avoid this whole debate.

 As a former waitress, I am obviously aware of the expectancy for tips. While I felt that I had to earn my tips, I often worked alongside of people who didn&apos;t feel the same. They felt they should be tipped no matter how well their service was.

People have become so used to the idea of tipping, that now restaurants are able to pay extremely low wages. It is however illegal for them to take a cut of the tips their servers earn. Yet by using tips as part of they pay, they are still making money by paying their employees less. Customers actually end up paying half of a servers wages.

When I am expected to tip, I do so according to the service. If its good then I tip, if its not then I don&apos;t. And I do not feel the need to tip everyone who provides me with a service. I pretty much limit myself to those in the restaurant biz.

Tipping has gotten way out of hand. I certainly do not feel the need to tip someone who is making more than I am.

 I understand tipping should not be required, but seriously, a couple bucks to one person can make or break a service staffs income. Servers do pay taxes on there tips, and hair stylists rent the chairs and the rest goes to them, not the establishment. I think all those people who say&quot;why should I tip if your already getting a wage&quot;should spend one month as a server dealing with people like yourself. You&apos;ll agree that tipping is a good thing.

 while 15 percent is standard, I, as a former waiter, tend to give at LEAST 20%, knowing full well how little a server makes per hour. That being said, tipping above 15% should be the standard unless the server works at a high class restaurant, where 15% could net $8 per customer.

 I think tipping should not be expected. Originally you would tip someone who offered you service beyond what you expected of them. Or in low paying jobs where there just wasn&apos;t the money there we would tip the people to help out struggling business owners but now no way when I am paying $100 for a haircut and delivery fees and such I don&apos;t think it is warranted. Tipping should be banned. I tip when I have had good service and leave nothing if the service has been bad. I find it frustrating that I pay $100 for a hair cut that takes 45 minutes and then am expected to pay the hairdresser a $20 tip on top of it. I can understand when a haircut cost $10 or $20 that it was necessary to tip them but now? When really going by the prices I am paying they should be making more an hour than me. If they are only getting paid minimum wage I think the question has to be where is the rest of the money going? We shouldn&apos;t be expected to pay for their services just so greedy salon owners can pocket huge fees because lets face it have their expenses gone up that much that cost of a womens hair style has more then doubled in 15 years? Does a comfy chair, a pair of scissors and a razor really cost that much more than it did in the 80&apos;s or 90&apos;s? As for pizza delivery guys, if the company charges a delivery fee I don&apos;t tip. I figure that fee should be going to them if it isn&apos;t then why isn&apos;t it? Tips should be given to people who offer you an extraordinary service beyond what is expected of them...if you are just doing your job I don&apos;t think tips should be expected...nobody tips me at my job...

 Alright, I understand that these people get paid to work via a salary or wage but that&apos;s not the case. When you tip someone, you pay for the service, the personality. Put it into perspective, envision it. If you&apos;re working hard all day just to keep a smile on your face (which makes a huge difference to any customer), I think just that deserves a small token of appreciation. If, of course, the situation arrises where someone just can&apos;t seem to satisfy your needs on a personal level, then don&apos;t tip them or give what you think they deserve (I&apos;m not telling you to punch them in the mouth if they put pickles on your burger) and just be respectful.
I don&apos;t think someone should feel obligated to tip a certain amount or even at all, but it&apos;s a respectful and kind gesture nevertheless. Take a few bucks you would&apos;ve spent on a coffee and donut to make someone keep up their good work.

 Wow! Tipping is such a big cause of giving answers. Okay, I will weigh in as well. Day job...no tipping. I work at a corporation in the mailroom. We provide service all day long to staff of the company and our outside clients. I don&apos;t get tips nor do I expect them.

Part time job as an usher at a theatre. Don&apos;t expect tips, but am surprised and appreciative when I do get them. When selling ice cream or water, it is a pleasant surprise. Also when I am doing coat check. You really wow me when I get tipped for seating you. Yes, we really do like the tips, it helps us get by as not a great paying part time job. Not allowed to put out a tip jar though, that is just wrong.

Volunteer bartending at a theatre in Toronto, all tips go to company? Actually I am not sure where they do go, I think it is for volunteer services department of the theatre company.

I do tip for good service in restaruants and hair cutting establishments. Rotten or really bad service does not need encouragement. Sometimes I don&apos;t tip because I don&apos;t have the money. Lower paying jobs with crappy part time job without work doesn&apos;t give you a lot of leeway with the money.
So I try to tip where I can.

 Personally I tip 10 - 20% to wait staff and bar keep. I usually tip $2 for a $15 hair cut.
I believe the majority of people feel our minimum wage is sufficient to provide adequate base line income. Knowing also that restaurant and bar staff are only paid 1/2 minimum wage and therefore must make up the remainder through gratuities.
Cabby&apos;s, pizza delivery, hair dressers alike provide a per unit /pay as you go service and are perhaps not as deserving in the minds of the stingy. I know several people who don&apos;t tip the owner, for example, as they feel they are already getting enough compensation.

 Easy one here, I feel that tipping works when I actually get very good service of some sort, meaning over and above what I would expect. But come on tipping when I&apos;m at a convenience store or at a fast food restaurant. Not going to happen as I&apos;m paying for a big mark up and is a teller really providing the kind of service that would warrent a tip?

Examples of service providers where I would tip are;
Waiters&amp;Waitresses
Hair Stylist
Valet

And what is wrong with a 15% tip? The amount that I feel is adequate depends on the total dollar value of the bill and the level of service.

Thanks,

 Well, I am one who will forget or just choose not to tip other services. My belief is this, i too worked in an minimum wage job as a cashier and in that line of work we of course did not receive tips and so I decided that well we choose our line of work and if you choose to be a hairdresser, limo/taxi driver or waiter/ress don&apos;t expect tips because it is like an added effect to the job you&quot;choose&quot;. I do give 15% tips to servers who were excellent in their service and if the service was horrible either there would be no tip or very little that may pay for chocolate bar. Yes my words are harsh but its reality.

 Anyone ever see the beginning of the movie RESERVOIR DOGS by Quinten Tarantino ? A violent movie but just watch the opening scenne with regards to tipping. It is very true. Just because waiters and waitresses get minimum wage why should the customer pay their salary, or a good chunk of it !
I hate tipping regular service.

 I think it&apos;s absolutely ludacrous that salon owners even EXPECT a tip! My god, they already make ridiculous profits off the stylists rental fees and the prices they charge for the different services. I will tip the stylist but I am NEVER going to tip an owner of any business! Ridiculous!

And there should not be a set amount, period. You should tip based on quality of service, nothing should be expected. That&apos;s why you get bad service because these people figure they are entitled, and they shouldn&apos;t be! Of course it is a fault of the restaurant industry for example for allowing the minimum wage level for that industry to be set so low. Maybe if their people got paid properly for the work they do they wouldn&apos;t have to rely on tips to get by. But, if there were no set standard for tipping then maybe the waiters and waitresses of the world would actually work to earn the tip with exceptional service!

 The trouble with tipping is that it should be given for a job well done. Unfortunately, not every job is so great that it deserves extra money.
I for one do tip my hairdresser - even on those cuts that are so-so. Since my hairdresser not only cuts, but does everything else in the shop, I guess you could say that I tip everybody.
In restaurants, my husband does the tipping, no matter how bad the service. I don&apos;t agree with tipping when the waiter/waitress is surly, slopppy, or just too busy to wait on me.
To summarize, maybe Canadians are tight fisted about tipping because the service doesn&apos;t warrant it.
The next time you go into a place of business and find the employee on the phone making a personal call --- are you going to tip???

 15% tip is ridiculous. I went for breakfast and my bill was $5 with a bottomless cup of coffee which I took her up on. A 15% tip is 75 cents - I gave her $2.00 or 40% tip. A group of four went to celebrate at a more expensive restaurant and the final bill was $300. At 15%, a tip is $45 for the two hours we were there. That is $22 an hour on top of her salary and other tables she served. Low paying job?? That is way more than I make. I tipped $20 which is way more than the poor breakfast waitress. Smarten up America. 15% tip is ridiculous

 Tipping was originally reserved for when a really good job was done ... not a average job, not a decent job - but exceptional performance. Today we are told that we should tip 15 - 20%, we should give a tip for&quot;any&quot;kind of service, we need karma through helping out the poor downtrodden retail workers. The problem is, as noted above, most of these employees work for some of the biggest companies in the world - if the&quot;fair market&quot;price of the good or service is x + 15% then charge that and pay the employee what they deserve!

The relative paycheque of the employee should have no bearing on what I pay, and it certainly shouldn&apos;t excuse the inflationary rise in acceptable tipping rates ...

 I would just like to make a comment before I answer the question. I am a server in a fairly busy restaurant, and on average, none of the servers make an average of 15%. Most days we as a whole make only 10%.
When you take into account that in our resturant servers make only 7.25 per hour and most count on tips to pay bills.

Now I&apos;m not saying that everyone should tip 15% automaticly but I do think that people should try to put themselves in the server&apos;s shoes for a day.

I don&apos;t think that canadians are confused about tipping, It&apos;s just that they don&apos;t think that everyone should get a tip for doing their job. Especially if they are making a good wage.

 Tipping should be a result of the service done. With a more labour-intensive service (e.g. haircut, meal out, manicure) the tipping percentage should be higher than other services (e.g. coffee shops). No one deserves a tip for being rude or doing nothing to assist you. That being said, people who claim they can not afford to tip should stay home and wait until they can afford to tip properly for a job well done. Many people in the service industry work hard for little money and count on tips to pay their bills.

 Its definitely not that we are confused about tipping - I think that the idea of tipping has gotten out of control. The whole premise of a&apos;tip&apos;is that its a reward for exemplary service. I dont think that restaurant staff nor any other service staff should be entitled to a tip simply for doing their job. A tip needs to be earned and is by no stretch an entitlement. If I go to a restaurant, hair salon, taxi etc and the service is beyond satisfactory I will give a tip that is rated according to how happy I am with my experience. I will not ever tip just because its now become a mandatory guilty pressure on consumers. Staff already make wages - I am not their employer and therefore not responsible for having to give them money. If they want more than their wages then they should work above and beyond to make their customer feel impressed. I will reward service that is exceptional but I will not tip someone for doing the job they are paid for already and doing the bare minimum. I am appalled by people who say&apos;if you cant afford to tip you cant afford to go out to eat etc&apos;No - completely false. I can afford to go out if I can afford the meal prices. If I choose not to tip for bad service, bad atmosphere etc nobody should be complaining as if I left without paying. If you are a server and you&apos;re upset you arent getting tips - go get a new job. My job is not to work hard and supplement your low income - there are other options. Also - for as much as these servers complain they pull in ridiculous amounts of money off of tips - some of them end up making more per hour than I do so I&apos;ll be the last to feel sorry for them. Tipping should be decreased rather than increasing it to more service staff.

 I&apos;ll start with a cute joke.

the difference between a Canadian and a canoe?
A canoe will tip.
some of us North americans are notorious for our cheapness, not just Canadians,
where as myself and most of my Canadian friends are always tipping up front, when we go to all inclusives ,
we tip up front and through out our stay we are showered with extras, ( not the reason we tip up front, but it is a wonderful side effect of a happy worker getting his share up front)
I would suggest anyone who is going on a cruise do the same , we have done it for the last 10 years, its not surprising we get much of the other traveller&apos;s booze that was sent from home and not received because they turned out to be cheap tippers and were somewhat rude when they met the staff.and most likely were poor tippers. live and learn my friends , those people are just like us, just not as fortunate that&apos;s all

 I always tip 15% on service personnel who basically make minimum wage, unless the service is deplorable. I will tip exceedingly more for special service. I will not tip Trades people as much, as they make a very good salary. Always will offer a beveridge if at my house, and if they are polite, I will tip $20-50 based upon service (and cost on service... could be much more).
I am easy to get along with, and not picky, so easier to please. I will not tip sloppy work, or a bad attitude. I will tip huge for service&quot;beyond&quot;what is in their daily job description.
(In many cases, many make more money than I do annually, but generally it is not an easy job by any means.&quot;)
Thank you.

 I think part of the reason is that sometimes we just aren&apos;t sure when it&apos;s appropriate, and most people are too afraid to ask! I think tips should be given according to the level of service received. I understand it&apos;s hard to make a living on mimimum wage and it can be pretty tough working in the service industry, but people shouldn&apos;t expect to receive extra money if they do not earn it.

 I usually tip my change at a fast food resturant, coffe shop etc... if the service was good... if i get somebody yawning while asking for my order or being a general snob... i tend to keep my change..

i&apos;m also quite stingy when at regular resturants... if service was good.. awsome.. a tip from me.. usually the tax or 1.5 times the tax.... but never more....

i also do not like being flirted with while i&apos;m out somewhere eating. Sure, its flattering.. but if i&apos;m friendly... i don&apos;t want the Girl (or boy) to take it as an open invitation to flirt with me or touch me... i&apos;m fairly uncomfortable with it.... if i&apos;m good friends with somebody... they&apos;ll be lucky to get a hug... but never at a resturant.

i feel service should be friendly... but not in your face nor personal, whether family, friend or not. I came to eat, not get a date or be weasled to get an extra tip.. i got my standards and one oand i do my best to be friendly when sticking to them.

 Canadians aren&apos;t confused, but some service industry people are. By the rationale of the article, by the time we finished tipping the waiter, the busboy, the cook, and the dishwasher, our $40 lunch would be $60! Prices are already too high, and for a customer who feels gouged they can hardly be expected to spread goodwill towards everyone. Canadians tend to not complain about service and still leave a good tip!

 I am a waitress as well as a good tipper. And I am an excellent waitress. I rarely get 15%. I usually fell lucky to get 10% as an average from my tables.

We don&apos;t pool our tips with other servers, but we do have to tip out a certain percentage to the kitchen, the hostesses, and the bartenders. Even when we receive $0 tips, we still have to tip out. So if you don&apos;t tip us, we lose money to serve you.

People don&apos;t seem to realize that if you don&apos;t tip the good waitresses, employers will eventually have to include tip in the bill and you will be tipping all of them, even the bad ones. This is how they do it in many European countries.

I have worked many different kinds of jobs where I was paid much more than minimum wage. Waitressing is much more emotionally and mentally taxing than any other job that I&apos;ve had. It is incredibly difficult to be friendly and enthusiastic for 7 hours straight, especially when people are being rude to you. You can tell the true character of a person by how they treat those that serve them. Tips hopefully bring my wage up to equal that of the aforementioned jobs.

Why would I do this job if it is so difficult and pays so badly? I am great at it, and that is satisfying. Many other people do it because it is the only kind of job that fits their lifestyle. Some are students that can only work at night. Some are parents who can only work at night because they can&apos;t afford childcare and that&apos;s when their spouses are home from their day jobs. Some do it because it is their second job. In fact, I know very few servers who don&apos;t have at least 2 jobs, just to make ends meet.

For people that say they can&apos;t afford to tip, well, in my opinion, you can&apos;t afford to eat out either. If I don&apos;t have enough money in my pocket to leave 15%, I stay home and cook for myself. The only time I don&apos;t tip is when my server is rude to me. There is no excuse for rudeness. I even leave 10% for bad service, because everybody has a bad day, and this could be theirs.

 gratuities were traditionally paid for services that had a low pay scale. not all service jobs have a standard of low pay. i&apos;d never think to tip someone making a salary that keeps the above poverty. unless the service is very far above expectations.
