Rate Your Service Five Different Ways

 By Carole DeJarnatt 
 
Have you experienced exceptional customer service? How did it make you feel? I do not know about you but it gives me a wonderful feeling somebody showing they really care. When I receive service as such, I try to let the person or manager know. In today&apos;s world it is rare that you receive comments of satisfaction, much less for superior service.

I recently stopped at a Captain D&apos;s fast food restaurant in Tifton, Georgia. As my husband and I were walking up to the restaurant, an employee was outside and greeted us with a friendly &quot;hello&quot;. We walk into the restaurant and we are greeted by many friendly &quot;hellos&quot;. The front counter and kitchen personnel were all wearing big smiles and welcoming faces. I asked them if a contest was going on within the franchise system to judge who the friendliest store was. I was told by the order taker that it was their job to greet customers in a friendly manner everyday. I also noted as I walked through the door, that most everyone was busy cleaning something. The counter, the floor, the tabletops, the bathrooms; you name it the employees obviously took great pride in their jobs and the store.

My experience at this location made me aware of how important it is that we not only give customer service, but that we exceed our customers&apos; expectations. These employees exceeded my expectation by the constant smiling faces, friendly conversations, customer care in a fast food environment, and cleanliness of the facilities. If I were that franchise owner I would be very proud.

Where do you rate with your customer service? Some of my recommendations on evaluating services are:

 Do an email survey questionnaire . The answers you receive will be a huge benefit to you if you take heed to them. Have Customer Service Representatives ask questions about the service to incoming callers. Some people will not want to take the time but others will be glad you asked. Mail a survey via postal service. Do not leave out those who do not share the world&apos;s enthusiasm with technology. Adapt your survey or phone queries to your business model . In a franchise model, each owner would need to adapt their efforts to how they do business. Perhaps their only venues are fairs and festivals. Survey your customers as you supply their product. Perhaps give them so much off if they fill out your questionnaire. Be creative and make it fun for the customer . This is just another form of exceptional customer service. How many times have you had fun telling a business what you thought about their service? 


Most companies realize the need for customer service but successful companies strive for exceptional. Exceptional service is what makes you stand out from your competitor and if applied effectively you will not have to worry about the competition in the future.
