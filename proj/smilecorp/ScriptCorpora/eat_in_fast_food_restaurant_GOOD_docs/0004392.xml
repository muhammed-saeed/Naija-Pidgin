As I was walking by the Chase branch on 10th Street and Second Avenue where the 2nd Avenue Deli used to be , I was compelled to take a quick photo of a sign in the window.  I thought I would just let the images speak for themselves.

 Crowdfunding: Past, Present and Future 
 Posted on September 16, 2011 by Ben 
Crowdfunding—the idea that many different people can contribute small amounts of money to fund a large idea or project—has enormous potential to transform the way we think about investment.  It’s a concept that is near and dear to our hearts here at Villager, and something we spend a lot of time thinking about.  We’ll be posting some major content about our thoughts on the subject in the not so distant future, including a post on yesterday’s Congressional hearing before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight&amp;Government Reform.  (Yay for Congress talking about something useful and not the war on lightbulbs !)

In the meantime, however, here is an interesting post from Mashable discussing the history and evolution of crowdfunding–from its roots in microfinance lending in poverty stricken and developing countries, to the development of peer to peer lending in the United States, and now the rise of powerful crowdfunding platforms to generate money for ideas and creativity.

We have our own thoughts about the future of crowdfunding and how it can be used to connect investors with local businesses while we soak up the annoying parts of finance.  More to come on that subject soon.

 The Big Box Fallacy 
 Posted on September 13, 2011 by Ben 
When Borders bookstore announced it was closing all of its stores and filing for bankruptcy earlier this year, more than 10,000 people lost their jobs .   Terrible for the employees, and terrible for many communities that may well find themselves without a local bookstore after years of municipal subsidies favoring big box retailers instead of locally grown small businesses.

 

If there is any silver lining to be found here, it may be that the Borders bankruptcy provides a“teachable moment”for municipalities with desolate Main Streets: it’s time to stop subsidizing big box stores and start fostering meaningful local economies.

As Stacy Mitchell, a researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance , discusses in a recent article for Business Week, Borders, like so many other big box retailers, received plenty of tax breaks and subsidies  from local governments looking to create jobs. One California town spent $1.6 million in federal grant money to lure Borders to the local shopping mall , and is now faced with paying $33,000 a month in rent to the developer while the store sits empty.  Wal-Mart, Target and other big box retailers regularly extract major concessions from communities looking for an easy way to grow the local economy.  But do the big box retailers really create lasting jobs?  Too often, the big stores move into huge parking lot centers outside of town and drive local businesses out, only to close up shop when another town offers deeper tax breaks and the lure of a bigger, newer shopping center.

As one recent study notes, a consortium of local governments in the St. Louis area discovered that cities and counties in the region spent a staggering $5.8 billion financing private development, 80% of which went to the construction of new chain stores and shopping centers.  And yet, astoundingly, the region has seen virtually no economic growth! According to the study, the big stores caused over 600 local businesses to close, and those losses more than offset any gains resulting from the new development.

Would these towns be better off if they had invested instead in local businesses? It’s hard to say.  But investing locally has it’s benefits—thriving local businesses don’t pack up and leave at the next offer.  Plus, spending money locally is known to generate a multiplier effect , or local premium, that benefits the whole community.

In the wake of Borders’closing, will independent bookstores step up to fill the void ? And will their communities support them?

 Marketplace Volatility: One More Reason to Start Thinking Local 
 Posted on August 10, 2011 by Ben 
So I don’t know if you noticed, but the stock market has been sort of crazy recently.  Earlier this week, the S&amp;P dropped almost 6%, capping off a week of bad news bears in the marketplace and bringing market lows not seen in a couple of years.  Call it a panic or a global rout or a market correction or OMGWTFBBQ.
 
This is definitely a better graphic for the stock market than a downward pointing arrow.
 
A day later, at least for the time being, the market is surging again. (UPDATE: 12 hours later this was immediately reversed . Yay.)

It is entirely possible that all this volatility is because investors really are worried about systemic risks from the Eurozone crisis or the S&amp;P downgrade or whatever else.

Or, as Amy Cortese describes the modern investment world in her book Locavesting , the volatility of the past few days is probably also a reflection of the fact that Wall Street is a very different place than it used to be, having transformed into“a swirling vortex of profit-seeking electrons.”

There was a time when the marketplace served ordinary investors:  companies sold securities (e.g., stocks and bonds) to raise money or grow.  Individual investors made their money by finding value where others did not, or parking your money with a company and letting it grow over time.

Those days are gone.  Investment firms went public, and the risk of loss shifted from investment professionals to their shareholders.  The people making investments had less accountability, and could make riskier decisions while constantly searching to increase returns. If the bets didn’t pay off, someone else was holding the bag. (ahem, that would be, um, us).  Meanwhile, sophisticated investors with lots of cash threw money at investments in esoteric products that nobody really understood.  Margin trading (that is, speculating with borrowed money) became commonplace. These days, a ton of trading isn’t even done by a person anymore—it’s all automated, securities flying back and forth at light speed. By some estimates, in 2009 nearly 2/3 of all equity trades resulted from high frequency trading rattled off by algorithms .  Not a human in sight.
 
Automatic trading by robots: All your stock are belong to us.
 
We at Villager think it’s time to simplify investment.  Although the global marketplace will always be an important part of our economic system and investment portfolios, why should it be the only option for investors? We think it is time to bring our wallets back to the communities where we live.

Local investment has the power to keep vital businesses thriving, preserve neighborhoods, and create jobs close to home.  But it also has the added benefit of empowering the individual investor.  When you invest where you live, the fruits of your investment are a tangible thing.  You can see it, touch it, talk to the people who work there.  If we are ever going to move away from the boom and bust cycle of huge profits and market crashes, we need to encourage people to invest in value again and not just the next most profitable venture.

That’s one reason why Villager connects local investors with local businesses. Villager will allow you to loan a small amount of money to a business near you: you’ll get paid back in full and earn great rewards while making a difference in your community.  And no robots will be making decisions about where your money goes.

 Our Job – To Soak up the Annoying 
 Posted on July 27, 2011 by villagernyc 
Everyone and everything has its place – a niche, a talent or a purpose.  Villager’s is to soak up the Annoying.  Let me explain.

Our mission is to re-define and reinvent local investment and make it available to everyone by offering simple loans from communities to their local businesses.  We plan to do this by taking on the painful hair pulling eye-gouge-inducing stuff, internalize and figure it out and then offer the simplest product solution to the complicated problems of finance.

We’ve met with small business owners and collected data about investing habits from everyday people. The business owners often need a little cash to stay afloat in off-seasons or to improve successful enterprises.  They soon find the prospect of getting additional funding to be nightmarishly complex and time consuming.  The casual investor finds the markets a daunting proposition both for its breathtaking opacity and the sense that one cannot bet against the house and expect to win.

We find that these problems are really annoying.  We would like to soak up the Annoying—to handle all of the brutal stuff ourselves and provide you with a clean, simple solution.

 A Multitude of Annoying → One Simple Solution 

We offer one very simple product to connect businesses with local investors.

As an investor, you can lend a small bit of money to a local business you like and want to see succeed in your community. In return, they will pay you back the money, reward you for the gesture and build a relationship.

As a local business, we offer you the chance to escape the labyrinth of capital raising and help you get the simplest of loans from your supporters.  As a sweetener, you will get the opportunity to identify and reward your most loyal supporters, while building a relationship for the future.

On board?  Good.  Lets get to the Annoying.

 Company Troubles – No Money, Mo’ Problems 

Almost every small business owner seeking capital suddenly finds themselves in hostile waters.  Securities laws, accredited investors, sophisticated investors, retail investors, Regulation D, private placements, loan applications, debt covenants, intrastate offering exemptions, convertible bonds, par value, collateral, debt service coverage ratios, FICO scores, tax structures, bonds, shares, revenue sharing, debentures…the list continues. (Trust me.  It continues.)  People go into business to sell their grandma’s pie recipe, their design virtuosity, their dreams of selling bacon-infused desserts and ultimately their desire to create, share and fund their talents, passions and dreams.  They do not go into business to ensure the satisfactory pricing of convertible debt securities by setting the appropriate conversion discount when their company attains a fair valuation upon a subsequent round of financing.

Usually they turn to the banks first.  But unless the business is abnormally profitable or backed by a mortgage or a rich uncle, the banks frequently and firmly say no.  Why waste the manpower on carefully understanding the personal stories of a bakery seeking $10,000 with a 10% interest rate when the banks can easily get a $1 billion dollar loan with 5% interest from one of the big boys?  The banks throw the teensy bakery loan application into a credit-analysis machine and see what the not-so-friendly small-business-banking-algorithm says.  Bad news bears for the small business owner and not a priority for the banks.

The next step is then to try to raise money through equity or debt investments.  But the most tentative forays into these treacherous waters forces a business to seek the assistance of lawyers who will charge half of what the business was trying to raise in the first place just to get the business owner some peace of mind and basic understanding.  But in doing so, the business owner is often no closer to finding any actual investors with reasonable expectations – they just have the paperwork.  Very expensive paperwork. Annoying .

 Investor Troubles – Stocks?  Bonds?  CDS on the CDO-squared? 

For every investor seeking some place to park their investment dollars, the investment waters are a minefield.
 
Yes, there are such things as underwater mines. My metaphor is sound.
 
Smooth talking brokers selling the opportunity to invest in the latest cresting bubble (while charging only $29.95 per trade), rampant insider trading, anomalously rich financial intermediaries, hedge funds, mutual funds, closed end funds, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), CDOs of CDOs (CDO-squared), credit default swaps on the CDO-squared, flash crashes, Eurozone defaults, debt ceilings, Aa3 ratings, Caa2 ratings, BBB+ ratings, F1+ ratings (which is, somewhat ridiculously, the highest possible grade in its class), Black-Scholes pricing models, margin calls, corporate excess, GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliation, preferred stock, converts, call-spreads and of course the all-too-common giant stacks of complex financial disclosures (do you know what a derivative option collar tax strategy is?)…
 
I bet this is like the introductory summary of the derivative option collar tax strategy.
 
…well, you get it.  (Clearly, that was overkill.)

The odd thing is that Americans have learned the ins and outs of savvy consumption – organic versus conventional foods, sweatshop labor versus living wages, Pepsi versus Coke, paper versus plastic, Louboutin versus Crocs.  We expertly navigate all aspects of how we spend our money, but we are completely helpless in navigating how we invest our money.  It’s too complicated and too difficult to truly understand (and 2008 taught us that even the professionals don’t understand it either).  We often avoid it or trust the professionals to handle our money for us (for a hefty fee).

And even if we do understand, it is hard to believe that we are really being protected. A thumb is always on the scale, but whose side is it on?  If a major bank is asked to arrange a trade between a hedge fund client with $20 billion assets under management and a mass of faceless, unsophisticated investors, who do you think is going to benefit from the trade?   ANNOYING.

 Let Villager Soak Up the Annoying and Simplify Investing 

Villager’s job is to leap fearlessly on these deeply annoying and frightening problems as if a pack of wild boars, wrestle them into submission, cure them lovingly in our smokehouse and serve you a beautiful BLT.
 
Run guys!! Villager&apos;s coming back!
 
While we cannot say with a straight face that we enjoy this task, we certainly do relish in the task of simplifying all of it down to simple and comprehensible terms and offering the world a new investment alternative.

As it stands, we understand that it is natural to either stay out of the water or to risk dipping your toes and have them ripped off by the sharks.  We want to get you back into the water.  (I am done with the water imagery now.)  We work hard to internalize all of these incomprehensible obstacles and regulatory complexities and the immense time drain of dealing with bank officers, reading prospectuses, hiring lawyers and finding investors and investments.  We absorb the onslaught of regulatory issues. We leverage our platform and work with you to help match investors to businesses.  We allow you to follow your own gut intuition on what businesses deserve investments while tackling the financial issues.  We create instruments that anyone can understand:

A loan.  A reward.  A relationship.

Leave the rest to us.

 Why Food Trucks Should Be Illegal 
 Posted on July 23, 2011 by villagernyc Reply 
This is already a bit old, but worth a read anyway: Zach Brooks of Midtown Lunch wrote a great op-ed in the Times responding to the recent crackdown on food trucks in Midtown. He makes some excellent points about why it’s better for everyone if food trucks remain“illegal”on the streets of New York.

If you don’t know the background , here’s what happened.  You may have noticed that food trucks are popular.  (If that’s news, you should probably go outside more often.)  As more and more newfangled high-end food trucks have taken up space in places like Midtown, old-school vendors and brick-and-mortar stores have started to get pissed.  Responding to rising complaints, the NYPD cracked down on Midtown food trucks—which, technically, aren’t really allowed to park anywhere in Midtown under the law.

As Zach tells it, the laws surrounding food trucks have been kept purposefully vague for years: the city didn’t want to ban street vendors, but at the same time couldn’t officially sanction all of the city’s parking spaces as rent-free commercial zones.  This nebulous legal regime worked fine when there were only some hot dog carts and halal vendors, but the balance has shifted dramatically now that there are regularly four to five food trucks parked back to back along city streets.

In the wake of the crackdown, some people have suggested the laws should be changed, circulating a petition to officially sanction food trucks and street vendors.  Zach, perhaps counterintuitively, argues that legalizing food trucks would actually be a bad thing.  The whole article is worth a read, but this part in particular jumps out at me:
 
Vendors and fans are actually better served by the status quo. New York’s street food scene is unique and vibrant precisely because it exists in that legal gray area. Traditionally only immigrant and small mom-and-pop businesses were willing to risk the city’s intermittent crackdowns. The vague rules have long deterred any passionless big businesses looking for the next lucrative franchise. Turn street spots into legal real estate controlled by the city, and it will be only a matter of time before street food becomes just as bland and generic as that of any fast-food restaurant in Midtown.
 
Sadly, he’s probably right. What’s more, the political landscape in New York is especially unlikely to facilitate a creative resolution to this problem. Should the city officially sanction vendors all over the streets of New York, you probably do end up with the Burger King-ification of street food.  But let’s say the city tries to legalize while regulating output to protect the diversity of street food, perhaps by restricting the availability of licenses to vend (already a precious commodity). Chances are high we’d end up with endless red tape and a food truck oligarchy caused by high barriers to entry.  Neither of these is good for the consumer or for New York.
