 Gingrich Rises Up to Glass Ceiling 

 By Ross Kaminsky on 11.4.11 @ 6:09AM 
 
He&apos;s gone about as far as he can go -- but he might be ideal in
a more ceremonial role.
 
 On Wednesday, for the first time since Herman Cain&apos;s
presidential candidacy began gaining traction in September, Newt Gingrich&apos;s betting odds of
earning the Republican nomination to run for the presidency have
surpassed Cain&apos;s. 

 Gingrich is trading around 7 percent while Cain hovers
near 5 percent. A week ago, before the Cain sexual harassment
charges surfaced, the numbers were roughly reversed, with Cain
close to 8 percent and Gingrich around 3.5 percent. (For those
unfamiliar with Intrade.com, the odds are not set by bookies;
instead the site works as an exchange with the prices based on
where market participants are willing to buy and sell.) 

 During this week of turmoil, Mitt Romney&apos;s betting odds
have barely changed, going from about 69 percent to 70 percent,
while Rick Perry&apos;s odds have actually dropped by almost two
percent, from about 12.5 percent to 10.5 percent. 

 In short, while conventional wisdom is what Romney is the
main beneficiary of the chaos surrounding Herman Cain, betting odds
tell a different story: the big winner, at least for one week, is
Newt Gingrich. 

 This isn&apos;t a big surprise from a betting perspective with
Romney&apos;s odds already so much higher than his polling numbers. It&apos;s
a lot easier to make a substantial move up from 3 percent, where
Gingrich was 10 days ago (and where I bought some Gingrich
&quot;futures&quot;), than from the high 60s, where Romney has been for most
of the past month. 

 Also, it speaks to the persistent, almost desperate,
search by much of the GOP base for someone, anyone, other than
Romney with the belief that Romney is a liberal in conservative
clothing. This is of course a theme which pro-Obama forces such as
the Washington Post are eager to
reemphasize , probably because
they (1) expect Romney to be the nominee, and (2) fear him most
among the Republican field. Democrats understand, as many
conservative Republican activists sometimes overlook, that the flip
side of flip-flopping may be to enhance Romney&apos;s ability to portray
himself as a moderate, potentially a major benefit in the general
election. (To be sure, balancing &quot;flip-flopper&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; will
be an act fit for the political equivalent of a Cirque de Soleil
acrobat, and with the political risk of doing that balancing on a
high wire without a net.) 

 I wrote a few months ago that former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich had disqualified himself from the Republican nomination by his statement that Paul
Ryan&apos;s Medicare reform proposals were &quot;right-wing social
engineering.&quot; Although Newt has done much to rehabilitate himself
with conservatives, perhaps enough even to forgive such an
egregious statement, I continue to believe he is not electable as
president. 

 His personal baggage is too heavy and will make him unable
to narrow the &quot; gender
gap , &quot; a phenomenon in recent elections as
well as in approval ratings of our current president whereby women
prefer Republicans less (or Democrats more) than men by somewhere
from 5 to 10 percent. Gingrich&apos;s professorial approach and his
focus on &quot;big ideas&quot; is laudable and has an important place in
politics, but says nothing about his abilities as an executive. And
how can we forget this gag-reflex-triggering
vision of Gingrich sitting on a couch with
Nancy Pelosi, saying &quot;we do agree that our country must take action
to address climate change&quot;? 

 To be fair, Gingrich publicly regretted making the ad , and one year
later described Nancy
Pelosi as &quot;despicable, dishonest, and
vicious.&quot; Slightly too tame, but at least not sitting on a couch
making nice to help an Al Gore organization. Nevertheless, even
rock-ribbed conservatives mistrust Gingrich in a way that might
even be worse than the more common criticisms of Mitt Romney.
As Quin
Hillyer laid out on these very pages , not
only has Gingrich held non-conservative positions on health care
and climate change, not only has he had some spectacular political
failures following the important success of the 1994 elections, but
he seems to bring out his sharpest fangs when criticizing
conservatives. 

 Pace my friend Quin, on balance I like (or at least
tolerate) Gingrich and could imagine him being a good president,
bringing energy to sweeping reforms and regaining American
influence abroad. But a Gingrich nomination offers more risk than I
am willing to accept of four more years of Barack Obama. 

 Although the numbers have probably improved slightly in
recent days, the RealClearPolitics average of three
recent polls matching Gingrich against President Obama gives Obama
a 14 percent advantage. This compares to a 2 point edge for Obama
over Romney. 

 President Obama currently has, again according to RealClearPolitics poll averages , an 8
point edge over Herman Cain (though that will probably spike up in
upcoming polls), a 10.5 percent advantage over Rick Perry, a 14
point lead over Michele Bachmann, and a surprisingly narrow 6 point
lead on Ron Paul. 

 In other words, while Herman Cain&apos;s turmoil is causing
more people to look at Gingrich and is likely to give Gingrich a
slight boost in an Obama matchup, he nevertheless has been one of
the weakest Republicans in the field based on head-to-head polling
against Obama, hardly an insignificant measure. 

 As much as it may be appealing to support &quot;the smartest
guy in the room&quot; for the most powerful position on the planet, it
is far preferable for Newt to be, at most, the eventual Republican
nominee&apos;s running mate. 

 Can you imagine a Newt Gingrich versus Joe Biden debate?
True, people rarely cast ballots based on the VP candidate, but
several studies show that Sarah Palin substantially changed that
dynamic in 2008. (The studies tend to conclude, as this most recent one does , that Palin
ended up costing the Republican ticket substantial support among
&quot;swing voters.&quot;) A Gingrich-Biden debate would highlight better
than any other candidate confrontation I can imagine the literal
stupidity of the Obama administration. It would leave voters, most
importantly independent voters, simply unwilling to vote for a team
that places Biden a step away from the presidency.

If Newt had Perry&apos;s solid conservative record or Perry had
Newt&apos;s debate style we&apos;d have the perfect candidate. As it is Mitt
Romney&apos;s buddy the liar Herman Cain is undercutting conservatives
and helping only his good friend Mitt Romney.

Considering how friendly the Liar and Mitt are with each other
could Cain have leaked the news about his bad behavior to help
Mitt?

I predicted that Newt would be the next one put forward by the
elites to divide the conservative vote. I said Herman Cain was done
weeks ago and it had nothing to do with sexual harrasment. It had
to do with his idiotic tax plan and his stands on abortion, foreign
policy, the Federal Reserve, and his general lack of knowledge
about history, foreign policy, geography, economics, etc.

Now I have been advocating a long and intelligent debate over
where this country is going by the only 2 candidates who have a
chance of beating Obama Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. They both polled
the best against Obama in pre Herman Cain polls. Ron Paul does the
best by far of any Republican among the young, the independent 40%
of the electorate, and conservatve Democrats.

Romney has the elites and the Mormons behind him. Ron Paul has
the issues, the solutions, and a huge personal following. Let there
be a long, intelligent, honest debate about where this country is
headed. Then lets hold the primary elections and see if we can
unite the party and country. If they put Newt up there as well I
wouldn&apos;t object. At least he is intelligent, but totally
unelectable.

Ronald Reagan was considered unelectable to national office in
1976, so Gerald Ford was nominated by the Republican
ewstablishment. (accidental misspelling, but I think I will leave
it in there)

WOW!! You are, like, sooooooo smart!

Actually, you&apos;re not, and the fantasy world you inhabit is rich,
indeed.

Nobody &quot;put&quot; Cain at the top; he did it based on the strength of
his debate performance, his personality, his common-sense approach,
his personal approachability, and his business experience.

The tail is NOT wagging the dog, Jack...once again, you have it
exactly backwards.

Same with Gingrich. He&apos;s flat-out impressive in debates, and
unlike Ron Paul, he can point to a record of acomplishment as a
Legislator.

In other words, Ron Paul is a talker; Newt is a do-er.

Ron Paul will NEVER be President, Jack...ever.

And if he goes 3rd Party and hands the election back to Obama,
then we&apos;ll know how much of a true patriot he and his robotic
followers really are...

...my guess is not much.

In other words, Newt is a &quot;doer&quot; like in arm twisting his fellow
Republicans in the House to vote for the Clinton jobs killing
NAFTA?

Oh,yes, Newt is a &quot;doer&quot; but everything he touches turns to
dooie.

The doctor rights of GOPville get a whiff of s**t from Newt and
delude themselves into believing that it&apos;s not crap at all but food
from the gods.

Ron Paul may not be your cup of Tea Party but he votes according
to the rules of the Constitution. In other words while your hero
Newt was voting along socialist lines, Ron Paul stuck to the
Constitution and voted accordingly.

You avoid addressing the Newt and Clinton tag-team that forced
the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement down the
throats of Americans.

How is NAFTA a plus for sovereignty and free markets when the
NAFTA Newt helped pass is nothing but managed and over-regulation
of trade and more big government bureaucracy?

Your score card is titled toward the socialist scale and that is
a losing card.

When US manufacturing exists America dur e toi Newt&apos;s NAFTA and
WTO treaties it equals =
ZERO for Americans
Two for the International socialists

Newt suggested that those wishing to define him should define
him as a &quot;futurist.&quot; Okay fair enough.

Newt the Futurist
In 1994, Gingrich described himself as “a conservative futurist.”
He said that those who were trying to define him should look no
further than The Third Wave, a 1980 book written by Alvin Toffler.
The book describes our society as entering a post-industrial phase
in which abortion, homosexuality, promiscuity, and divorce are
perfectly normal, even virtuous. Toffler penned a letter to
America’s “founding parents,” in which he said: “The system of
government you fashioned, including the very principles on which
you based it, is increasingly obsolete, and hence increasingly, if
inadvertently, oppressive and dangerous to our welfare. It must be
radically changed and a new system of government invented — a
democracy for the 21st century.” He went on to describe our
constitutional system as one that “served us so well for so long,
and that now must, in its turn, die and be replaced.”

In comes Newt
Gingrich recommended The Third Wave as essential reading to his
colleagues when he became Speaker of the House. In his forward to
another Toffler book, Creating a New Civilization: The Politics of
the Third Wave, he grieved at the lack of appreciation for
“Toffler’s insight” in The Third Wave and blamed politicians who
had not applied his model for the “frustration, negativism,
cynicism and despair” of the political landscape. He went on to
explain that Toffler advocated a concept called “anticipatory
democracy,” and bragged that he had worked with him for 20 years
“to develop a future-conscious politics and popular understanding
that would make it easier for America to make the transition” to a
Third Wave civilization.

Does that sound like a &quot;winner&quot; to you. If he does then what
does that make you? A newted &apos;futurist&apos;?

According to Real Clear Politics and their compilation of polls,
as of October 31st. Ron Paul is second to Obama head to head. He is
6 points behind. Romney is no 1 about one point behind Obama.
Nobody polls over 50% including Obama. As I have stated for weeks
it is down to Romney and Ron Paul. They are the only ones who can
beat Obama. I think Romney would be a disaster as a candidate. But
have to say, in my opinion, he is the best of the elite candidates
left. Cain and Perry are dead men walking and Gingrich is Billy
Kritol&apos;s and the Weekly standards favorite guy. Need I say more.
Newt is never going to be President, but is intelligent and could
be part of the debate between Ron and Willard. Let the real debates
begin and then we will have the primaries. Lets hope the party can
be united and we can beat Obama.

Romney has paid flacks in every state. He has gotten the most
face time from the media and he has his own and the Mormon money
and organization behind him. Ron Paul has by far the greatest
number of contributors and activists. He gets the most financial
support from active military people then all other candidates
combined. Ron Paul, in studies of the media, is dead last in face
time from the main stream media. His huge undergound support on the
internet and elsewhere is the thing keeping him competive. Of
course he has been right about the problems and issues facing this
country for decades and is by far the most intelligent and best
debater. He also does the best of all the Republicans among
Independents, Democrats and the young without which no Republican
can be elected.

Dr. Wrong Ron Paul is number 2 in polling against Obama.
According to Real Clear Politics, the combined polls as of October
31st put Ron Paul in second place of all Republicans against
Obama.Romney is in first place. I have told people like you for
weeks that it was down to Ron and Willard. For a further comment of

I&apos;m not voting Obama either, friend. Honestly though, what are
the significant differences between Romney and Obama? Romney is
enough of an opportunist that he could plausibly run to the LEFT of
Obama, and his (currently shameful) liberal bona-fides would
probably allow Romney to be taken seriously as a (D) candidate.

Also, do you honestly believe that the US became a &quot;stagnant
socialist state&quot; right when Obama got elected? We&apos;ve been heading
toward corporate-managed socialism for the better part of 50 years,
and you think it&apos;s all Big Bad Obama&apos;s fault?

It&apos;s almost endearing how little you know about history.

Now you&apos;re just throwing out ad hominen attacks and mis managed
talking points. Corpoarate managed socialism...who planted that in
your pea brain.

Corporations are comprised of people who are employed and
compensated to produce product for profit. When corporations
compete they are forced by free market pressures to maximize
quality and quantity in that product and thus provide goods and
services that the public requires and needs. Yes, owners who have
risked their money can reap vast rewards but in doing so they also
provide others with an ability to support themselves and their
families. And in a fully functioning free market America anyone can
have the opportunity to achieve wealth.
And if you learned your history in the public school systems of
today its no wonder that you would have this negative view of free
markets and the freedom to create a corporation. Whatever history
you think you learned is no doubt tainted by your affinity to be
indoctranated by those who would teach you.

We are in unusual times and it is too soon to count out
Gingrich. Romney illustrated again last week that he blows with the
wind. He could get the nomination, but he would be chewed up in the
national election. He runs for cover to much to inspire people. If
Perry can re-start his campaign, he can be the nominee. If not,
Newt. He is brilliant, but erratic. His history includes a lot of
baggage. The same was thought of Winston Churchill in 1939. He was
probably the only leader who could save Britain and his postwar
reputation is unrecognizable from his prewar reputation. Who knows,
maybe Newt can have a Churchillian moment. We are definitely in a
crisis where many of the normal rules and expectations will not
apply.

While it may appear that Mitt Romney is getting his teeth kicked
in, not much has changed.

Newt Gingrich has too much baggage and as soon as he gets higher
in the polls nasty comments will soon surface about him and his
past.

This will all play to Perry&apos;s and Romney&apos;s favor and they soon
will be the last men standing.

You appear to believe Newt has a chance. People may be listening
somewhat, but Newt has no chance because Newt has no
principles.

Perry at least has some principles. If he sticks to them he
should start to turn it around.

Newt is a political chameleon and that&apos;s precisely why he&apos;s
having problems.

Newt has no real infrastructure in place which would appear to
indicate he has few followers but even further, it indicates he&apos;s
out for a boat ride not a boat race.

By the way, you appear to believe Newt would have a chance
against Biden in a debate and I don&apos;t see that happening.

Like most deluded liberals and apostates of big government,
Biden actually has sincerity about his beliefs.

Newt is like a flag in the wind and although he&apos;s been on the
public scene for many years portraying himself as a conservative,
Biden would actually take him apart because Newt is a big
government progressive when all is said and done.

In that sense he&apos;s just like Biden and it&apos;s difficult to argue
against one&apos;s self.

If you pay in state rates it&apos;s not a subsidy, you&apos;re paying.
However, it will lead to other subsidies in housing, health care,
etc.. I agree that it&apos;s wrong but in the scheme of things America
faces much worse problems. In fact, Perry is telling the truth of
his plans and record unlike the other politicians running in the
campaign.

Example: Obamneycare.

Maybe it has a lot do with Governor Perry sounding like Ron
Paul?

Perry has mentioned Austrian economics and has even bashed the
Federal Reserve and its current chaiman suggesting that &quot;the
Bernanke&quot; should perhaps be tried for treason if Bernanke continues
inflation of the US dollar by excess printing of them!

The Paul bashers need to take note that Paul&apos;s words and
philosophy are spilling over to Perry and Newt that borrow from the
good doctor&apos;s political lexicon everytime they are the debating
stage and out on the stump.

Paul quipped that Governor Perry makes him sound like a
&quot;moderate.&quot; http://thenewamerican.com/usne.....-moderateq 
But the reality is that Perry understands that Paul&apos;s decades long
fight on the Fed&apos;s inflationary policies are bearing fruit!

order up a pizza while questioning if his &quot;updated&quot; cowboy hat he
bought in Conn. might have been the wrong signal to offer for a
sexual rebuttal. Michelle is so hot...Rick too young in his
presentation...Gary Johnson&apos;s supporters too stoned to
vote...Hunstman too pretty and arrogant...Perry too insecure, even
with that super blown up chest he leads with in every
encounter.

Newt...Bill Clinton&apos;s older brother, just might have a real
score to settle with Obama-Mao. Could be the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot;
for politics.

It&apos;ll be the aftershocks that gets us, though.

Rick Santorum is well-versed in all the major issues--defense,
foreign policy, economy, budget, energy, social security, health,
welfare, immigration, and abortion/social issues. He&apos;s definitely
in tune with 90% of Republicans--his 16-year record of
accomplishment in the House and Senate attests to his solid
conservative principles. And, electorally speaking, I think he
would appeal to a broad spectrum of voters who might see him as a
vast improvement over the incumbent, even though you think &quot;people
rarely cast votes based on the VP candidate.&quot;

Santorum always looks like he&apos;s very constipated. His commitment

Santorum may not win Mr. Congeniality, but, as VP, he&apos;d be a

up and do the job if the unthinkable happened. His &quot;commitment to
the constitution&quot; seems no more tenuous than that of any of the
other candidates--save possibly for Ron Paul, who would let Iran go
nuclear rather than risk overstepping what he thinks are his
constitutional bounds.

I think you should read more Washington and Jefferson.

&quot;The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations,
is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as
little political connection as possible. Europe has a set of
primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote
relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the
causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence,
therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by
artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or
the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or
enmities.&quot; - Washington

&quot;War is an instrument entirely inefficient toward redressing
wrong; and multiplies, instead of indemnifying losses.&quot; -
Jefferson

&quot;Peace and friendship with all mankind is our wisest policy, and
I wish we may be permitted to pursue it.&quot; - Jefferson

Not to mention the fact that pre-emptive, aggressive war is a
war-crime.

Ross - It is not so much that conservatives will stay home if
the nominee is Romney. It is that our contributions and volunteer
work will be shifted to other races where we can support candidates
enthusiastically. Romney is another John Boehner and will certainly
not provide decisive limited government leadership.

I don&apos;t like Santorum either. He is too much of a whiner. I
spoke with one of his colleagues a while back who indicated that he

Dmac, it isn&apos;t just &quot;personal,&quot; Newt is a total socialist, big
spender, big government, Nancy Pelosi buddy and weirdo
environmentalist.

Newt&apos;s Contract on America
The Republican Party’s supposed answer to big government. It turned
out to be a public relations smokescreen to cover various
unconstitutional measures that Congress planned to pass under
Gingrich’s leadership. The Contract included a “balanced budget
amendment,” which amounted to a Republican excuse to continue
spending while claiming to fight for fiscal conservatism. If the
government only spent money on constitutional programs, the deficit
would take care of itself.

Other areas of the Contract on America dealt with measures to
reduce welfare programs and relieve tax burdens on families and
businesses. The Constitution prohibits welfare programs. Newt&apos;s
&quot;contract&quot; only proposed to nip at them around the edges. If
Gingrich had been loyal to his oath of office, he would have worked
not to trim themm but end them!

Federal spending in all the areas addressed by the 1994 Contract
rose in subsequent years. Edward H. Crane, president of the Cato
Institute, observed that “the combined budgets of the 95 major
programs that the Contract With America promised to eliminate
increased by 13%.”

Cato Institute&apos;s Crane said: &quot;Over the past three years the
Republican-controlled Congress has approved discretionary spending
that exceeded Bill Clinton’s requests by more than $30
billion.”

Newt&apos;s police state affinity
The Contract asked for stronger federal crime-fighting measures,
despite the Constitution’s prohibition on federal involvement in
police matters outside of piracy and treason. Countries that do not
have such strict constitutional safeguards on federal police end up
with Gestapos, KGBs, and Departments of Homeland Security. But
that&apos;s okay with your man Newt.

You need to know that you will be supporting a Constitution
violator in Newt.

counted out, G.H.W. Bush was struggling to break out of the pack
before Iowa and McCain&apos;s obituary was being written at this time
four years ago, because he was polling around 6%. If I had to bet

Russ, you may put too much faith in Intrade, which is a fun site
but hardly representative of the electorate. Romney is not nearly
the lock that Intrade makes him, and Perry may rate a buy.

Gingrich is fun to watch in the debates. He&apos;s fun to watch on TV
at any time, which is where he should stay as a pundit. I agree
that he can&apos;t be the nominee due to crushing personal baggage, and
I can&apos;t even see him as Veep. But as Cain implodes (and I believe
he is imploding, though slowly) Gingrich&apos;s numbers almost have to
improve by default. See the latest Rasmussen poll, for instance,
where Gingrich is up to 14% behind Cain at 26% and Romney at
23%.

Inside punditry note: Bill Kristol may be converting Weekly
Standard into Gingrich For President. First it was Ryan, then
Christie, now maybe Newt. For Kristol it&apos;s anybody but Romney,
whether he&apos;s to the left or right.

Well, I don&apos;t expect Bill to ever support Ron Paul (wink).

 Old Blevins | 11.4.11 @ 10:58AM

The reason we endure (and enjoy) the silly season of primary
debates and primary voting is for the party to decide who we desire
to be our presidential candidate. Basing our decision on the most
&quot;electable&quot; candidate should not, in my opinion, be the primary
consideration. None of our candidates are perfect---they never are.
But the idea that political handicappers believe that Newt cannot
win the presidency, therefore he should be ignored by the primary
voters, pretty much nullifies the intent of the primary season. If
our primary voters do not want Newt as our candidate, no problem.
But there are a lot of voters who don&apos;t won&apos;t Romney as our
candidate, either. I have no idea how the primary will play out. I
do remember that until a few days before the 1980 presidential
election, it looked like Jimmy Carter was going to be re-elected,
because the national polls indicated that a small majority of the
voters preferred Mr. Carter over Mr. Reagan. Ronnie won by a
landslide.

Same conversation about Newt as yesterday. he is one of the best

serious consideration. Certainly he has a significnat role to play
in the next administration. We need to be thinking in terms of the
team required to undo the havok of the last three years and focus
on which people fill which role. The actual individual nominee is
secondary to forming and implementing corredt policy changes.

 Interested Conservative | 11.4.11 @ 11:39AM

Mr. Kaminsky - this is well stated, but more a review than
breaking new ground.

One question or observation - like all others, you reference the
&quot;personal baggage&quot;. I wonder how that breaks out along the lines of
the gender gap - namely, do men no longer care about that (I see
most of the ire recaps the Pelosi/Dede/Sharpton episodes, while Mr.
Hillyer adds more) while women cannot overcome that?

Which leads to question two - isn&apos;t Newt counting on time and
age having somewhat lessened the perception? Is he in the curious
spot of wanting to be perceived as older rather than younger? It&apos;s
interesting that he&apos;s 68, and Rep. Paul is 77, yet he seems
younger, and Rep. Paul sometimes verges into Stockdale
mannerisms.

Just curious.

Newt may be counting on time and age to help him, but the media

Tiffany&apos;s thing won&apos;t help either. Yes, he&apos;s wanting to be
perceived as older, and I don&apos;t blame him for that, but the whole
package just isn&apos;t electable, in my view. I do not say this with
any sense of happiness as I do think he&apos;d be a decent candidate
(and decent president) other than this baggage. But again, I think
it&apos;s too heavy.

I don&apos;t think men will care as much as women about Newt&apos;s
various marital shenanigans.

Newt is a pompous windbag. He had a great opportunity as

because he could not get along with fellow House Republican
members. He became more interested in writing books and giving
speeches rather than do his job as the first Republican Speaker in
50 years.
The picture of Newt and Nancy Pelosi on a couch talking about
global warming speaks volume, much more that the long winded

million.

I&apos;m pretty sure after 4 years of Obamunism, they will be out.
Lets elect ABO----then at least we can hold them accountable and
perhaps replace in the next cycle.

By that time----Ryan, Rubio, Christie, Daniels, Pence, Jindal

If you think Gingrich is more of a risk than four more years of
Obama, you&apos;re a PINHEAD

I took my registered Independent better half over to see Newt at
a little golf course several weeks ago. The turn out was very
light. Still, the man and his baggage hosted their documentary on
American exceptionalism and spoke to it in moving terms. My better
half was moved beyond his cynicism to volunteer for the campaign.
If Newt can get his ideas in front of enough people, momentum can
be built. He still has a year. The one risk not yet mentioned is
that Callista Gingrich bears a striking resemblance to Cindy McCain
albeit with less terra-forming. While she is not a lightweight, the
lacquered, platinum look invites distrust from a broad swatch of
women. Surface, I know, but you see who is the current
president.

Sorry sir but I saw and heard Calista , on a book review on T.V.
She sounded and came off as the sweetest person on the WORLD
totally nice.! That makes her one heck of an asset! The country
will adore her!

Just a few weeks ago old Newtie was on Greta advocating a guest
worker program as part of his so-called comprehensive immigration
reform. Newt is the poster child for being a one-world globalist --
he is from the cheap labor, pro-China wing of the RINO Party
disguising himself as a conservative.

Here&apos;s a test: Would you vote for Joe the Plumber over Obama? If
so, why?

Now, compare the Republican candidates with Joe the Plumber .
How does he or they stand up? Which ones place America first? Which
ones will make American taxpayers their &quot;cronies&quot; for a change?

I really want to like Newt for all the usual reasons. But, as
you say, lots of baggage there. I wonder if his behavior would
change for the better if he was elected president.

Would I vote for Newt over Obama? Hell yes!

Newt&apos;s colors change according to whom he is addressing.
Recently he took words right out of Ron Paul&apos;s speech that Paul
delivered on the floor of the House. Paul proposed using power
granted to Congress to clip the wings of the Supreme Court&apos;s Roe
v.wade decision via Article III, section 2.
{click for text} http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A3Sec2.html 

Newt ignored Paul&apos;s bill to check the SC&apos;s appellate
jurisdiction when Paul introduced it way back when Newt was
apparently too busy chumming up to Bill Clinton&apos;s &quot;jobs&quot; killing
act- NAFTA.

At a GOP televized debate Newt burst forth with great enthusiasm
on using article III, section 2 to check Roe v.Wade never giving
credit to Paul for bringing this Congressional power up years ago
in Paul&apos;s Sanctity of Life bill. But Newt has always been that way-
a self-serving newt.

There is one heck of an east coast bias in much of this. It is
the South (including FLA) and West who have the electoral votes to
pick the GOP President, adding Ohio and NC to the mix. Why by any
reason should NY, NJ, IL, CA have any say in selecting the GOP
nominee? They will never deliver an electoral vote to the
Republican.

As a Californian, I have no problem with that. It is also how
Abraham Lincoln won the Republican nomination in 1860. The
delegates&apos; top priority was to win and they looked at who had the
support from the 4 key battleground states. The states were
Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and, if I recall correctly, New
Jersey.

So RJ, Who among the group can carry the battleground states of
NC, Ohio and FLA? That is who we need. No state that went with
McCain will change sides so it requires us to pick some from
Obama.

Yes, sir, the 9 states that Bush won in 2004 which Obama carried
in 2008 are the states to look at first. (Virginia, North Carolina,
Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico&amp;Nevada). I
would add New Hampshire to the priority list since Bush won it in
2000 and it seems to be getting slightly more reddish. I don&apos;t know
which candidate is strongest in those states, but I am sure they
will let us know when the time comes.

As far as California is concerned, we had a sad story this week.
Chuck DeFore, the conservative candidate for the GOP Senatorial
nomination in 2010 has given up his campaign for Orange County
Supervisor and moved to Texas. It is hopeless out here.

Romney and his supporters must be worried about Gingrich. My
support is behind Bachmann but you can be assured if she leaves the
race my support is going to Gingrich. What I see with Romney is
someone with no core, someone who is beyond desperate to be
president, and would NOT get rid of Obamacare but instead keep
parts he agree&apos;s with. In short, Romney would be a better manager
of &quot;big government&quot; and it really doesn&apos;t make me want to go out to
vote.

Just out of curiosity, do you ever talk to people randomly on
the street about politics, or are you stuck in the current Repub
hall of mirrors talking to ghosts and reflections?

My policy/philosophy has always been to talk to (and read)
EVERYBODY, so long as they appear to be sane, which leads to a
better sampling of opinions. Based on my research, it doesn&apos;t
matter which of the Repubs winds up as the candidate, Obama will
win.

Where else will the Dems go? But the Repubs are hopelessly
fragmented because of a severe case of intransigence.

I am calculating that the Las Vegas housing market will show
significant signs of life by next June, which would be a harbinger
of general improvement in the economy, which would politically
benefit -- guess who?

I find it puzzling that there are studies that definitively
state Palin was a drag on the 2008 Election while at the same time
liberals viciously eviscerate her. How both can coexist is...
illogical.

Also, what exactly would motivate an undertaking of such a
study? When was the last time any VP candidate was similarly a
subject of scholarly study?

btw By bizarre coincidence I happened to be watching C-Span live

Neill had the cameras rotated to reveal Gingrich speaking to an
empty House. Newt is still doing essentially the same thing today:
grandstanding.

You say that people would not allow Biden to be a step away from

is equally true that if he debated Obama, people wouldn&apos;t want
Obama to be in the Presidency.

In 1995, Time magazine named Newt Gingrich “Man of the Year.”
The Time article lied that Newt was a states’ rights
conservative.

Like professional wrestlers that hate each other in the ring but
buy each other drinks away from the screaming crowds, Gingrich and
Clinton both agreed at a debate in Clare-mont, New Hampshire, that
they were “not far apart” in their views. Later Clinton publicly
thanked Gingrich for his support of the President’s pet projects in
areas such as welfare, education, labor, the environment, and
foreign affairs. Clinton made special mention of Gingrich’s support
of the $30 billion Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
that shackled gun owners with new restrictions, federalized a
number of crimes, and handed the feds police powers that the
Constitution reserves to the states.

Gingrich showed himself a friend to Clinton’s military policies,
with a flagrant disregard for the constitutional mandate that
Congress alone may declare war. He made a formal appeal to the
House of Representatives in 1995 to “increase the power of
President Clinton” by repealing the War Powers Act. He praised
Clinton’s unconstitutional use of the U.S. military to inflict a
communist regime on Haiti in 1994, the same year he voted for an
extra $1.2 billion for United Nations “peacekeeping” missions. He
also urged the President to expand U.S. military presence in Bosnia
the following year.

Gingrich’s support of abortion and anti-family measures, federal
welfare, a presidential line item veto, the National Endowment for
the Arts, confiscation of private property, amnesty for illegal
immigrants, higher taxes, and a myriad of other unconstitutional
legislation.

It wasn&apos;t Palin who cost the election in 2008. It was the tag
team of Bush and Mc Cain, two establishment GOP members, who
combined to make Obama look credible. Palin changed that narrative,
but got no support from the RINOs.

Paul has no foreign policy other than abdication. Cain has none
but ignorance. Romney&apos;s electability is hamstrung by Romneycare and
Perry&apos;s by his Bushiness under pressure. Bachmann has fringed
herself with amateurish and ill though rhetoric. Absent a brand new
candidate, and despite the fact he was literally my least favorite
choice excepting Paul The Elder, I&apos;ve gotta go with Newt. I&apos;m
hoping his ability to string several coherent thoughts together
without gaffing himself will continue to distinguish him from the
most undistinguisable pile of incompentent mush I have seen since
1996.

Ross,
We &quot;anybody but Romney&quot; crowd always have one other option on
election day 2012 if Romney is the nominee and I intend to exercise
it. Better a Democrat statist than a GOP statist. If Romney is the
nominee I will vote for Obama.
My lovely bride is more principled than I. She has announced that
if Romney is nominee she will simply stay home.

Somebody tell how Obama loses under those circumstances. I WILL
NOT HOLD MY NOSE AND VOTE FOR MCCAIN JR!

Give us a real conservative that can be trusted and Obama is
toast.

&quot;that the flip side of flip-flopping may be to enhance Romney&apos;s
ability to portray himself as a moderate, potentially a major
benefit in the general election. &quot;

Since being moderate worked out so well for John McCain? The
&quot;Anybody but Romney&quot; group actually remembers how 2008 was lost and
how 1980 and 1984 were won.

I am not so sure:

Rombama will not be an asset for the nation and may be the end
of the conservative movement.

Gin-grinch may turn out to be alright, but his track record is
not good... as several good comments have pointed out.

Honestly, I don&apos;t know where you are sitting... but 4 more years
of Obama will be worse than another Republican progressive how?

Elect someone who will undo nothing: And every slight
pro-American decision will lead to howls of rage and hate from the
Left. The fool will then implement Lefty-ism with special
guarantees to a few Republican friends on Wall Street... assuring
them that the taxpayers will pay through the nose until the end of
the Republic. The Left will rage and spew more lies and hate.

At the end of it... nothing will be accomplished except we might
be one thin dime less in debt... just enough action to allow
pundits to blame everything from the economy to the alignment of
the stars on conservatives without making any noticeable dent in
the taxes or the debts or the deficits.
