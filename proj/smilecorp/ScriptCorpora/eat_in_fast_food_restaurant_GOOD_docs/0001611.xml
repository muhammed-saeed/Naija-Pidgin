 Phantom Diner - Chipotle Mexican Grill is a Healthier Choice to Mexican Fast Food 0 comments 
 
As always, the Phantom Diner would like to thank the sponsors of the column, Generations A Restaurant and Pechin Firehouse Restaurant for their continued support.
 
And my thanks to a faithful reader, Felicha, for submitting this week’s restaurant, Chipotle Mexican Grill. Chipotle is a chain restaurant with many locations in the Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. I chose the Chipotle Mexican Grill located on Route 30 in Greensburg across the highway from Wal-Mart. After visiting their web site ( www.chipotle.com ) , I have to say I was a bit skeptical. My first impression of their home page was that it has a lot of information but was scattered all over the page like a high school student taking bad notes in class, but as I got deeper in to the site’s pages, the design and structure of the information were well displayed.
 
When I arrived, the restaurant had nice curb appeal with the flagstone columns, stone arch way, nice clean sign and an outdoor seating area. But I couldn’t help notice the construction going on behind the building. I quickly took note that this restaurant was popular with high school and college students when I walked in and found many groups of kids. The interior design followed a very industrial look with the designer concrete floors, wire framed chairs with thin wooden seats, red painted steel railing and stainless steel walls and tables. The artwork on the walls followed the same look as their web site.

Now, there is one question that has created much controversy in my department where I work. Should Chipotle be considered a fast food chain restaurant? For me personally, even though there is no drive thru at this location, there are still many factors that tell me, anytime I have to stand in line to order and pay for my food, it’s a fast food restaurant. Chipotle has the ordering and food preparation set up much like a Subway Restaurant assembly line. You tell the first person the beginning of your order, whether you want a burrito, burrito bowl, taco or a salad. Next decision is if you want chicken, steak, barbocoa (shredded beef), carnitas (shredded pork) or vegetarian. They hand off to the next person to decide any extras like fried or white rice, black or pinto beans, sour cream and/or guacamole. I chose the steak burrito with pinto beans, fried rice, hot sauce, sour cream and guacamole. The next employee asks if you want any chip or drinks and rings your order up for payment. Anytime my drink comes in a paper or thin plastic cup it’s a fast food restaurant. They have Coca-Cola products and bottled drinks. The web site shows they serve margaritas and beer but I didn’t see any displayed or advertised at this restaurant, but then again I didn’t see anyone behind the counter old enough to serve alcohol either.

Once you pay your bill, if you ordered a soda you can take your paper cup and fill it with ice and your choice of soda at the fountain, where they also have to go lids, straws and more hot sauce. Next is to find a table, which brings me to my next factor of a fast food restaurant. Anytime you don’t have a hostess or a waitress it is a fast food restaurant. The one table I found in the back appeared to be clean once I threw away the paper straw wrapper I found on the table top.

Now that I was settled in and very hungry, I couldn’t wait to dig in. The steamed tortilla was very fresh along with the rest of the ingredients. The steak was a bit on the tough side but had good flavor. The hot sauce had some spice but not overpowering. One burrito is plenty to satisfy even the bigger appetites. I also got a bag of chips with guacamole, and the guacamole had good taste but could have used some cracked black pepper. The corn chips were not kept warm which was a bit disappointing.

All in all I found Chipotle Mexican Grill to be more expensive, spending approx. $14 for a burrito, chips with guacamole and a drink, but a healthier choice to Mexican fast food. Next time you’re thinking about running for the border to Taco Bell, you may also want to consider Chipotle Mexican Grill. I wouldn’t travel a long distance just to go to Chipotle, but it would be a good choice if you’re already in the area where there is one. My thanks again to Felicha for submitting Chipotle Mexican Grill for a review and Generations A Restaurant and Pechins Firehouse for sponsoring my column. If you have been to a Chipotle Mexican Grill and would like to share your experience, please don’t hesitate to comment on this article.
