View Full Version : Lunch with a co-worker, how would you handle? 
 Omar Little 11-12-2010, 08:16 AM Tom and Jerry are co-workers. They do not socialize away from work, but have known each other for the past 5 years and will occasionally eat lunch together at a nearby restaurant. So one day, Jerry invites Tom to go to lunch at this restaurant. Tom orders an entre that he would normally order and Jerry orders the same entre. They both drink water. When the waiter comes with the check, he asks if the bill will be on separate checks. Jerry, says to just put it on one check and hands the waiter a plastic punch card. Jerry tells Tom, that they can just split it between them, which they have done in the past.

When the check arrives, it appears to be for only one lunch. Tom looks puzzled. Jerry retrieves the punch card and tells Tom his card allows the holder to order one menu item and get a second menu item of equal or lesser value for free, and thats how he paid for his lunch. Jerry does however leave a small tip for the waiter, for his share of the meal. Jerry tells Tom that his card will allow him to get one punch a month for a year, so they will have to come here again in a month.

If you were Tom, how would you react? footballisplayedwithyourfeet 11-12-2010, 08:22 AM Weee, lunch at half price!!

How else could you react? Omar Little 11-12-2010, 08:24 AM Weee, lunch at half price!!

How else could you react?

No, Jerry is not planning on sharing his coupon with Tom. He is expecting Tom to pay full price. Lynn Bodoni 11-12-2010, 08:24 AM I would think that Jerry was leading the pack in the&quot;Miser of the Year&quot;award. I wouldn&apos;t say anything...but if I were Jerry, I&apos;d offer to pay for half of Tom&apos;s lunch. Apparently Jerry isn&apos;t really interested in socializing, but in getting a free lunch, and he&apos;s using Tom to get that free lunch.

If I was Tom, I&apos;d probably have other things to do at lunchtime, rather than go to lunch with Jerry. Unless Jerry is a blast to be around. freckafree 11-12-2010, 08:26 AM If I were Tom, I might write Jerry off as somewhat of a jerk -- especially in regards to the&quot;have to come here again in a month&quot;part -- and have&quot;other plans&quot;the next time he asks.

Or depending on the relationship, I might say to Jerry,&quot;Dude. If it weren&apos;t for me, your lunch wouldn&apos;t be free. How&apos;s about we split the bill and each of us gets a half-price lunch?&quot;I have co-workers I don&apos;t socialize with outside of work that I&apos;d be perfectly comfortable suggesting that arrangement to. Anaamika 11-12-2010, 08:26 AM They didn&apos;t, though??? I mean, it looks like Tom paid full price for his lunch. It&apos;s...odd. I agree with Lynn; I wouldn&apos;t go to lunch anymore with him. Not that I can&apos;t pay for my own lunch, but if that&apos;s all I am doing and being used by someone else to get a free lunch, then I may as well go alone. Scarlett67 11-12-2010, 08:27 AM Yup, I&apos;d start making other arrangements. Promethea 11-12-2010, 08:29 AM I&apos;d be pissed off. Jerry&apos;s invited me to lunch and then basically said&quot;I&apos;ve got a Buy One Get One Free Offer - so you buy one and I&apos;ll get the free one&quot;. Except he&apos;s not even had the grace to come out and say that up front - he&apos;s let me get my money out before revealing the offer. That&apos;s low. Shakes 11-12-2010, 08:29 AM This is why cats and mice can&apos;t be friends. Fried Dough Ho 11-12-2010, 08:31 AM This is why cats and mice can&apos;t be friends.

:D:D:D SecondJudith 11-12-2010, 08:34 AM Jerry tells Tom, that they can just split it between them, which they have done in the past.

It sounds like Jerry is offering to split the cost of the meal here?

If he isn&apos;t, he should be, and Tom should tell him that. That&apos;s how my coworkers and I do things when we go out to lunch (which we nearly always do with coupons, special offers, etc) -- hand them over to the server, see how much we get knocked off the final bill, then split whatever we have to pay evenly. MeanOldLady 11-12-2010, 08:34 AM Jerry&apos;s an a-hole. They should split the cost. Sattua 11-12-2010, 08:40 AM Since I originally intended to pay the full price of my meal, I&apos;d pay it, but I&apos;d roll my eyes and try to skive out of lunch with Jerry in the future. Scarlett67 11-12-2010, 08:42 AM It sounds like Jerry is offering to split the cost of the meal here?

It seems pretty clear from this . . .
Jerry retrieves the punch card and tells Tom his card allows the holder to order one menu item and get a second menu item of equal or lesser value for free, and thats how he paid for his lunch.

. . . that Jerry considers presenting his punch card his&quot;payment.&quot;And the wanker didn&apos;t even contribute to the tip! Leaffan 11-12-2010, 08:45 AM Jerry&apos;s an a-hole. They should split the cost.

I wish you&apos;d stop continually beating around the bush like this. :p

Agreed. Fuzzy Dunlop 11-12-2010, 08:45 AM If you were Tom, how would you react?

I wouldn&apos;t react at all. Tom and Jerry have eaten lunch together at this restaurant occasionally for years, so the idea that Jerry was only able to get his free lunch because of Tom rings pretty hollow to me. Jerry got his free lunch 99.5% because he had a punch card and 0.5% because Tom was with him. Tom enjoyed his lunch, he&apos;d been with Jerry numerous times before and Jerry could go with anybody else and get the same deal, hardly a great sacrifice on Tom&apos;s part.

It might have been nice to offer to split the lunch, and I might if I were in that situation, but we have no idea where he got his punch card. Maybe he bought it specifically to lower his average lunch time costs. Maybe his wife bought it for him because she knows he loves eating at that place but they can&apos;t afford it right now. There are so many potential reasons and I don&apos;t really care about any of them.

Bottom line - if I were eating lunch with someone anyway and they had a buy one get one free coupon I&apos;d see it as equivalent to a gift certificate for a free lunch. As long as they earned it on their own they should be free to enjoy it on their own, regardless of the fact that my presence was technically necessary. don&apos;t ask 11-12-2010, 08:46 AM We do stuff like that all the time at work, you do it like this:

&quot;I&apos;ve got a two for one offer at Oporto&apos;s. Anyone want to split lunch?&quot;

And you each pay half. EvilTOJ 11-12-2010, 09:14 AM I guess it depends on how the punchcard works. If Tom&apos;s lunch made it so Jerry&apos;s meal was free (and he knew that), then yes Jerry&apos;s a dick. But if Jerry didn&apos;t know that Tom&apos;s meal would make it free, or if there&apos;s no way Tom&apos;s meal gave him the freebie then it&apos;s like paying with a gift certificate and no, no dickery there. Omar Little 11-12-2010, 09:20 AM And the wanker didn&apos;t even contribute to the tip!

Yeah, he did.

Jerry does however leave a small tip for the waiter, for his share of the meal. Peremensoe 11-12-2010, 09:25 AM As Tom, my first reaction on arrival of the check is to throw out cash for half plus tip. Look only at the total. Make Jerry explain in detail why he&apos;s not putting down money on the check. Furrow my brow.

Then... Tom goes to the restaurant often enough regardless, right? So he should get a punch card of his own, and invite Jerry to come along. Turn the tables.

If the combination isn&apos;t enough to make Jerry revise his thinking--no more lunches with Jerry. Ravenman 11-12-2010, 09:26 AM Jerry got his free lunch 99.5% because he had a punch card and 0.5% because Tom was with him. How do you figure? If Jerry went to the restaurant alone, he wouldn&apos;t have gotten a free lunch. Both the punch card and a sucker --- I mean a mark -- I mean Jerry were necessary conditions for his free lunch.

I think Jerry should have been up-front about the discount card. Since they seem to eat with each other with some frequency, they should have split it.

Otherwise, Jerry could have just gone to that restaurant with his wife and left her paying the bill. Scarlett67 11-12-2010, 09:27 AM Sorry, I guess I&apos;m not the only one who keeps confusing Tom and Jerry. Hell, I can&apos;t even remember which one is the cat and which one is the mouse! I stand corrected.

If I had a card like that, I&apos;d use it to treat the OTHER person. Doesn&apos;t cost me a dime, and it&apos;s free karma. steronz 11-12-2010, 09:34 AM Since I originally intended to pay the full price of my meal, I&apos;d pay it, but I&apos;d roll my eyes and try to skive out of lunch with Jerry in the future.

This.

Tom didn&apos;t get screwed out of anything. He picked a menu item, entirely un-coerced, and ate it. Then he paid for it. That&apos;s all well and good, and expecting/demanding a share of Jerry&apos;s freebie seems out of place.

That said, Jerry is really weird. So he&apos;s got this free lunch, but he wants to keep it under wraps because he knows full well that if he brings it up before the meal Tom will say&quot;Hey, we&apos;ll get the same thing and then we can each pay half!&quot;He knows this, and he should offer it up, but he&apos;s a tightwad and wants to pay nothing, not half. So he coyly extends a lunch invention, coyly lets Tom order first (which is a risk, because Tom might have felt like soup or something), and then coyly slips the punchcard in with the check. It&apos;s all very a very strange and anti-social way to save 5 bucks on a meal. footballisplayedwithyourfeet 11-12-2010, 09:48 AM Ok, if the idea behind the story is that Jerry is not paying anything and tom is paying his the full price for his meal, I&apos;d probably do the same as the others: pay, roll eyes and not go to lunch with him anymore (or insist on seperate checks:)).

But if the words are literally spoken like the OP suggests, I really would expect to be SPLITTING the check, whatever the amount on it may be. Peremensoe 11-12-2010, 09:54 AM Tom didn&apos;t get screwed out of anything. He picked a menu item, entirely un-coerced, and ate it. Then he paid for it. That&apos;s all well and good, and expecting/demanding a share of Jerry&apos;s freebie seems out of place.

If I were Tom, my response (in thought, at least) would be: I didn&apos;t go to lunch by myself here. Tom isn&apos;t&quot;demanding a share&quot;; Jerry is the one who asked Tom to share a meal--and then didn&apos;t. Leaffan 11-12-2010, 09:54 AM Sorry, I guess I&apos;m not the only one who keeps confusing Tom and Jerry. Hell, I can&apos;t even remember which one is the cat and which one is the mouse!

Fucking brilliant. I mean it, no sarcasm. That&apos;s like...enlightening. Baracus 11-12-2010, 10:03 AM So he coyly extends a lunch invention, coyly lets Tom order first (which is a risk, because Tom might have felt like soup or something), and then coyly slips the punchcard in with the check.
Or Jerry might have had a punchcard of his own, a coupon, or gift certificate that was&quot;not valid with other offers&quot;.

Jerry may not be out anything from this encounter that he wouldn&apos;t have been anyway, but it is a total dick move on Tom&apos;s part and I would avoid going out with him in the future. And if we want to get technical, the card gives the cardholder one free meal when he buys another. Since the cardholder did not pay for a meal, it would seem that in the spirit of the deal, he is not entitled to a free one. neuroman 11-12-2010, 10:33 AM Say and do absolutely nothing. Next month, go back to the restaurant. After Jerry orders, order an iced tea and then tell the waitress&quot;I apologize, I am on a special diet and won&apos;t be ordering any food today.&quot;Pull out a PB&amp;J sandwich, and eat said sandwich while Jerry enjoys his full-priced entree.

(P.S. For maximum good taste, leave the waitress a 100% tip on your drink.) Khadaji 11-12-2010, 10:45 AM Depending on the office, I would likely have busted the guy&apos;s stone mercilessly about being cheap all the way back to the office and in the office as well. My last job for instance, everyone would have made fun of the guy for days, that was the kind of office it was - and people would still be saying&quot;remember when...&quot;Every time we went to lunch people would ask if he had coupons to share. It would have been a running joke for a long time.

In fact, if I didn&apos;t feel comfortable enough with him to bust his stones, I probably wouldn&apos;t be at lunch with him.

Having said that, many years ago Pizza had a 5 minute guarantee on Personal Pan Pizzas. One of my co-workers suggested that we go to lunch and have that. He called ahead and ordered and by the time we were seated, it was already past five minutes. He asked for a free pizza. I was so embarrassed. The manager came out and told him it was 5 minutes from when the wait staff took the order, not 5 minutes from the phone call. I didn&apos;t say anything, but I never ate lunch with him again.

Now that I&apos;m older and a little more cranky, I probably wouldn&apos;t have been at lunch with him in the first place. even sven 11-12-2010, 10:57 AM Tom was a dick, and depending on my relationship I&apos;d either call him out or learn to avoid him.

If are in a group situation and you have something of benefit (like a discount) it&apos;s socially expected that you share that benefit. shiftless 11-12-2010, 10:57 AM Didn&apos;t they agree to split the check? I&apos;m having a hard time following who was the cheap douche with the punch card (Jerry?) but if I ever ate lunch with him again I would ask ahead of time if he had another such card. I would also like to invite him to go with me to to the grocery store with me next time I go. They have lots of&quot;buy one, get one free&apos; deals we could&quot;share&quot;in a similar way.

My wife and I know a couple who always wants to split the check. They say they can&apos;t believe how anal we are over the math, why not just split it down the middle? They also always manage to order more expensive food and drinks and more of them. What a coincidence! We no longer hang out with them. It&apos;s not worth the trouble of dealing with the cheapness. Balthisar 11-12-2010, 12:18 PM Sounds like Jerry&apos;s playing the dictator game, while Tom&apos;s wanting to play the ultimatum game. pepperlandgirl 11-12-2010, 12:34 PM I really wouldn&apos;t care or give it a second thought. If we were going to pay for our own meals and he had a punch card presumably because he ate there enough times to have a punch card, then good for him. It&apos;s not like super nice establishments hand out punch cards to their regular customers. Lunch probably cost $8 or $10 or something. And punch cards only work when they&apos;re full, which means he either eats there a lot, or I&apos;m the idiot for not having my own punch card to stamp when we go there.

I feel like I must be missing something here, because I don&apos;t even see how this is an issue. Who cares if he uses a punch card, a debit card, pennies, or seashells to pay for his lunch if I was never going to pay for his, and it was understood that he wasn&apos;t going to pay for mine? I mean, before I ever enter the restaurant, I know I&apos;m going to be out, say, $10. Would it be nice if I only had to pay $5 for my meal because Jerry went in on half after his free lunch? Sure, that&apos;d be lovely, but I sure as hell wouldn&apos;t expect him to pay for half of my food simply because he had a promotional coupon.

I guess he should have said&quot;Hey I want to go to restaurant A because I have a punch card for a free meal. Is that cool with you?&quot;but I still don&apos;t really see how the introduction of the punch card changes the expectations of the trip. PunditLisa 11-12-2010, 12:34 PM That&apos;s funny because every now and then I&apos;ll pull out a BOGO coupon and announce,&quot;I&apos;ve got a buy one, get one free coupon. Who wants to be the buy one?&quot;

The difference is that I&apos;m kidding.

Of course, the bill should be split into two. OR, at the very least, the coupon holder should say,&quot;Hey, I have a BOGO, so since my lunch is free, let me pay the entire tip.&quot;

People are so sad. Harmonious Discord 11-12-2010, 01:01 PM I have to disagree with the OP. The person with the card has just offered to pay for the whole meal. The best Tom could negotiate for is an even split. Jerry should tell the waiter that Tom can fuck off for any thing less. Leaffan 11-12-2010, 01:12 PM I really wouldn&apos;t care or give it a second thought.

The free meal was contingent upon the fact that one meal was purchased. Jerry used Tom as his vehicle to a free lunch. Jerry is a clueless twit with the social skills of a gnat. Cat Whisperer 11-12-2010, 01:46 PM Part of the problem beyond the societal expectation that a BOGO like that is split evenly between the two diners is that Jerry used Tom&apos;s lunch to fill his punchcard and get his free lunch (if I&apos;m understanding this correctly).

ETA: And also what Leaffan said. :) IvoryTowerDenizen 11-12-2010, 01:57 PM Yeah, the problem is that Jerry thinks he used both parts of the equation- The&quot;buy one&quot;AND the&quot;get one&quot;. But he didn&apos;t- Tom did the&quot;buy one&quot;part (unwittingly) and Jerry did the&quot;get one&quot;part. That seems unfair to me. I wouldn&apos;t make a fuss about it, but it would color my opinion of Jerry. Diogenes the Cynic 11-12-2010, 02:17 PM It&apos;s a dick move. Jerry is getting Tom to buy his lunch for him. The&quot;get one free&apos; is intended to be a reward for the one who pays. It&apos;s analogous to asking someone else to buy a two-for-one item at a grocery store and then asking them to give you the free one. Jerry is using Tom&apos;s money to get a free lunch (and doing so without telling him up front). Ass move already, and&quot;we have to come back next month&quot;just puts the cherry in the crack. Tom would be justified in asking for half the cost of his meal back (not that Jerry would be likely to pony it up), and&quot;next month&quot;would be out of the question unless Jerry was buying this time.

If it wasn&apos;t a cock move - and Jerry didn&apos;t already know it was a cock move - then Jerry would have told Tom what he was doing upfront. Diogenes the Cynic 11-12-2010, 02:19 PM I really wouldn&apos;t care or give it a second thought.

He wasn&apos;t paying for his lunch, he was getting Tom to pay for his lunch. To use another punchcard analogy, it&apos;s like getting somebody else to buy the last sandwich on your Subway card so you can get a free sandwich. jsgoddess 11-12-2010, 02:21 PM If I had a card like that, I&apos;d use it to treat the OTHER person. Doesn&apos;t cost me a dime, and it&apos;s free karma.

Your jib is showing, and the cut is fabulous! amarinth 11-12-2010, 02:26 PM I can sort of, kind of see thinking about it as a gift certificate or something. I can see how it could be ok. This though:
Jerry tells Tom that his card will allow him to get one punch a month for a year, so they will have to come here again in a month.is obnoxious. A demand to get a free lunch once/month for a year with no offer to share?
I think Jerry is going to be eating alone. IvoryTowerDenizen 11-12-2010, 02:46 PM Just cause I&apos;m curious... is this hypothetical or did it happen at your work? Are you Tom... or Jerry? :eek: MeanOldLady 11-12-2010, 02:50 PM And if you&apos;re Jerry, you&apos;re a jerk. It doesn&apos;t count as a personal insult if it&apos;s still hypothetical! Bob Ducca 11-12-2010, 03:35 PM He wasn&apos;t paying for his lunch, he was getting Tom to pay for his lunch. To use another punchcard analogy, it&apos;s like getting somebody else to buy the last sandwich on your Subway card so you can get a free sandwich.

This is the point I was about to make. .

The punchcard is owned by Tom and states that if the holder of the card buys a meal, he would get an equal or lesser value meal for free.

So technically, Tom is to pay for his own meal. And the 2nd meal, Jerry&apos;s, would be free.

What I get out of this story is that Jerry (though not entitled to anything - and would have paid for his own meal anyway) is a chump. Cheesesteak 11-12-2010, 03:45 PM He wasn&apos;t paying for his lunch, he was getting Tom to pay for his lunch. To use another punchcard analogy, it&apos;s like getting somebody else to buy the last sandwich on your Subway card so you can get a free sandwich.We don&apos;t know the exact nature of this punchcard. It doesn&apos;t sound like one of the free Subway punch cards, where anyone can get one, and putting my sandwich on your card prevents me from using it on my own card.

To expand on the hypothetical, let&apos;s say Jerry won the&quot;year of BOGO&quot;card in a contest. You and Jerry already go to this restaurant occasionally, would you stop going there with him or demand that he share his winnings with you 50/50 because you would be acting as the BO?

I will say, regardless, that Jerry was boorish for not mentioning to Tom that he had this buy one get one card before going for lunch. msmith537 11-12-2010, 03:51 PM I would do this. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1dKeeOipNY)

The cool thing to do is to split the meal. But technically, the card is the equivalent of cash. It&apos;s like Jerry brought a coupon for a free lunch. pepperlandgirl 11-12-2010, 03:59 PM Since this clearly wasn&apos;t a punch card that was literally punched (like at Subway), I imagined it was like the cards Paradise Bakery hands out (for example). That is, you earn rewards as you buy meals throughout the month, and then you get little perks like a BOGO. In that case, Jerry would have already&quot;earned&quot;his BOGO by virtue of eating there throughout the month. That second meal was already his, he was just able to take advantage of it because Tom bought his own lunch. Which to me is substantially different from the Subway system, where you would need somebody to purchase that 10th meal if you wanted to be a cheapskate and get the 11th for free.

That sort of card also makes sense with the revelation of the fact that he wants to go there to collect his free meal once a month. Either he won some sort of contest at Cheesesteak pointed out, or he&apos;s doing something the rest of the month to earn a free meal.

Now I agree that if he made Tom buy his tenth meal or whatever, that&apos;s a different thing entirely. So much so that it didn&apos;t even occur to me somebody would do that without at least asking first. If I had a friend who said&quot;Hey, I&apos;m a bit short this week, but I have an almost full punchcard for a free meal, do you mind using the card when you purchase your meal?&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have a problem with it. Diogenes the Cynic 11-12-2010, 04:02 PM If it was two for one, he needed Tom to buy the one. He used Tom&apos;s money to get a free meal. Brynda 11-12-2010, 04:03 PM I would be annoyed. Social convention is that you spilt deals like that. Cheesesteak 11-12-2010, 04:09 PM If it was two for one, he needed Tom to buy the one. He used Tom&apos;s money to get a free meal.If they split it, then Tom used Jerry&apos;s card to get a half price meal. Why is that better? IvoryTowerDenizen 11-12-2010, 04:11 PM If they split it, then Tom used Jerry&apos;s card to get a half price meal. Why is that better?

Compensation for Tom&apos;s part in helping Jerry get his meal? I dunno. Omar Little 11-12-2010, 04:15 PM Just cause I&apos;m curious... is this hypothetical or did it happen at your work? Are you Tom... or Jerry? :eek:

And if you&apos;re Jerry, you&apos;re a jerk. It doesn&apos;t count as a personal insult if it&apos;s still hypothetical!

No, the situation described is purely a hypothetical.

I actually did purchase a card like this through a fundraiser from a kid in my neighborhood. It is as described, you can use it once a month for a year, to do a buy one get one free of any entree item on the restaurant&apos;s menu. I have gone with a co-worker to lunch there and used the card, and we just split the tab 50/50 (I shared my discount with her). She was very thankful and said that she would have been happy to pay the full amount for her lunch and allow me to get my lunch for free, but I refused. It was this incident that got me thinking about how would someone react if Jerry had screwed Tom over like the OP states. pepperlandgirl 11-12-2010, 04:18 PM Compensation for Tom&apos;s part in helping Jerry get his meal? I dunno.

I just don&apos;t see why Tom is entitled to compensation. He paid exactly as much as he would have paid with or without the card. Jerry included a portion of the tip. He wasn&apos;t inconvenienced in any way. There&apos;s no indication he ate at the restaurant against his will. There&apos;s no indication he doesn&apos;t enjoy Jerry&apos;s company. If Jerry had a coupon, would he be obligated to pay for Tom&apos;s meal instead of his own? If he had a gift card to the restaurant, would he be obligated to offer to put a portion of Tom&apos;s meal on it? This just seems like an opportunity to be put out purely for the pleasure of it, rather than because Tom was actually put out by anything that happened. Otara 11-12-2010, 04:20 PM Its the same restaurant they eat at anyhow, and he paid a tip.

Its kind of funny really, Id be irked, but really Im no worse off than if he&apos;d just paid normally. There is the &apos;come to lunch with me when my next free lunch is due&apos; but a regular monthly lunch isnt unusual either.

I guess my initial thought is Id be surprised but would try not to worry about it, unless the company was bad in some other way.

Edit: But if I did the reverse, I wouldnt be surprised if it bugged people, so would avoid doing it.

Which is why mostly everyone is saying, if they were Tom they wouldn&apos;t make a big deal of it. No he&apos;s not obligated, but it&apos;s a social nicety.

But no one likes feeling used for someone&apos;s gain. As in, they didn&apos;t really want my company, they just used me for a free meal. Or, because I bought a meal you got a free one and couldn&apos;t even offer to split mine so we both benefit from you asking me to lunch. Most likely Tom would decline the half-meal payment, but it&apos;s nice to be offered. Diogenes the Cynic 11-12-2010, 04:39 PM I just don&apos;t see why Tom is entitled to compensation.
Why is Jerry entitled to a free meal from Tom? jsgoddess 11-12-2010, 04:49 PM I don&apos;t think anyone is entitled to anything, but I know that if I&apos;m doing something with someone, and if I were going to be getting a benefit that they weren&apos;t, I&apos;d want to share the benefit with them if I could. For example, if I went to a restaurant with a friend and then I was the 50th customer of the day and got a free appetizer, I&apos;d share the appetizer. The urge would be especially strong if my friend were number 49 and his going before me made me the lucky one.

Or, in a different vein, I got a free month of Vonage when someone signed up and used me as a reference. I didn&apos;t tell them to use me as a reference, but if I had, I would have said,&quot;This would give me a free month&quot;before they ever signed up so they could feel like they knew going in and that I wasn&apos;t trying to push them into giving me a benefit through their actions. the lone cashew 11-12-2010, 05:12 PM Jerry&apos;s an a-hole. They should split the cost.
This is my opinion also. prettydorky 11-12-2010, 05:25 PM It&apos;s analogous to asking someone else to buy a two-for-one item at a grocery store and then asking them to give you the free one.

Heh, I&apos;ve done that with my mom before. We each got one of something and gave the other the free one. The reciprocity is the key. Were I Tom, I&apos;d say,&quot;Cool, so next month my lunch is on you?&quot; doreen 11-12-2010, 05:38 PM I don&apos;t think anyone is entitled to anything, but I know that if I&apos;m doing something with someone, and if I were going to be getting a benefit that they weren&apos;t, I&apos;d want to share the benefit with them if I could.

The only circumstance in which I don&apos;t share the benefit of coupons , etc at restaurants is when we get separate checks. Generally speaking this would happen at some sort of buffet place or fast food restaurant. If it&apos;s a regular restaurant, and we&apos;re getting one check, then every one throws their free appetizer, BOGO, 10% off etc coupons in, and we split what&apos;s left over. If someone doesn&apos;t like that idea, we can always get separate checks - but then Jerry&apos;s BOGO is useless, isn&apos;t it? Lynn Bodoni 11-13-2010, 02:12 AM My wife and I know a couple who always wants to split the check. They say they can&apos;t believe how anal we are over the math, why not just split it down the middle? They also always manage to order more expensive food and drinks and more of them. What a coincidence! We no longer hang out with them. It&apos;s not worth the trouble of dealing with the cheapness. Funny, it&apos;s never the people who order the cheapest meals and drinks who want to split everything down the middle...just the ones who would have a lower bill if everyone pays the same amount. It&apos;s a small thing, but if I am drinking iced tea, and the person I&apos;m having dinner with is slamming down top shelf margaritas, then even if I order the most expensive dinner, the other person&apos;s bill is likely to be three times as much as mine is. Cheesesteak 11-13-2010, 03:57 AM I actually did purchase a card like this through a fundraiser from a kid in my neighborhood. Does this change anyone&apos;s thoughts on this?

Jerry paid his own money to get the BOGO card, is he still obligated to share 50% of the card&apos;s benefits with someone who didn&apos;t pay into it?

Should Tom kick in 50% of the card&apos;s cost, since he&apos;s sharing 50% of the benefits? TokyoPlayer 11-13-2010, 08:43 AM It&apos;s a dick move, and I&apos;d only go out with him once again, and&quot;forget&quot;my wallet, then tell him I&apos;d repay the next time. And never go again.








OK, I wouldn&apos;t, but I sure would be tempted. Alice The Goon 11-13-2010, 10:41 AM I&apos;d be a little annoyed if this happened and the coupon holder didn&apos;t offer to split the bill with me. But I wouldn&apos;t bitch about it. I&apos;d just, later in the afternoon, discretely slip him a ten or a twenty, murmuring something about how I know he must be having some hard times. It&apos;s the shame solution. Diogenes the Cynic 11-13-2010, 10:44 AM Does this change anyone&apos;s thoughts on this?

He&apos;s not obligated either way. The point is that he&apos;s still using Tom&apos;s money to get himself a free meal.
Should Tom kick in 50% of the card&apos;s cost, since he&apos;s sharing 50% of the benefits?
He wouldn&apos;t be sharing 50% of the benefits of the whole card. He&apos;d be sharing 50% of the benfits for that on particular month. It&apos;s also not a question of being entitled to anything, it&apos;s just the decent and civil thing for Jerry to offer. gwendee 11-13-2010, 01:21 PM Cat
Tom

Jerry


Same number of letters.

Cool! What else ya got?

I&apos;m just baffled that Jerry didn&apos;t clue Tom in at the time of the invitation.&quot;Hey, I have a BOGO deal at McSwizzle&apos;s. Do ya wanna buy one so I can get one?&quot;Closer to my own reality would be to mention the deal and suggest we split the check. Hey, 2 half price lunches!

I guess it makes sense that Jerry having bought the card, rather than having a free coupon from the paper would change the dynamic. I just think a heads up would be nice.&quot;Gwen the check comes your half is gonna be all of it.&quot; Isosleepy 11-14-2010, 10:15 AM If I&apos;m Tom, I&apos;m annoyed, and no more lunch together. However, that is irrational and stupid.
Scenario 1: Jerry and I are having Lunch. I pay 14 bucks, he pays 14 bucks. We&apos;ll have lunch again in a few weeks.
Scenario 2: Jerry and I are having Lunch. I pay 14 bucks, he doesn&apos;t. Now he&apos;s an asshole. That really doen&apos;t make sense.
What if this was in fact a punch card, and this was the 6th and 7th meal, and 3 meals down the road he gets a free one - does that still make him an asshole? Especially if I can&apos;t be bothered with punch cards?
There&apos;s something weird that people expect&quot;a cut&quot;when someone has a windfall or gets a freebie. I had a co-worker win the lottery. Some co-workers were genuinely angry he didn&apos;t share anything with them.
That said, I would&apos;ve shared the coupon, or more likely bought Jerry his lunch. I believe in sharing the wealth. But is asinine to insist others do. Shade 11-14-2010, 12:12 PM I agree it makes a difference if Jerry bought the card rather than got it as a free gift from the restaurant or similar. Although even if he did, the fact that it IS a&quot;buy one get one free&quot;suggests that it&apos;s probably discounted in the first place (I think).

Where Jerry loses is in not saying&quot;Tom, do you mind if I use this card,&quot;BEFOREHAND rather than asking him to split the bill, and then revealing the agenda afterwards. Even if the hidden agenda is comparatively harmless, it&apos;s still rude to solicit Tom&apos;s help in it without telling him what it was. jsgoddess 11-14-2010, 12:20 PM If I&apos;m Tom, I&apos;m annoyed, and no more lunch together.

The issue is that Jerry&apos;s free lunch came only because of Tom. If your benefit comes from someone else&apos;s actions, that person is part of the deal. Without Tom, Jerry pays for his own meal. There are two things Jerry needs to get his meal--Tom and the coupon. When you need someone to do something for you, you give them something in return. doreen 11-14-2010, 12:42 PM I have a similar, but true ,situation, and want to see if people see it the same way. A fairly large group of friends went on a trip. One person called and made the hotel reservations so that they could get a group rate. All of the rooms received a discount, and due to the number of rooms booked one room was comped. The person who made the reservations took the comp room. He told his roommate&quot;the rooms are $100, so your share is $50&quot;, The roommate hit the ceiling when he found out this room was actually free. ( he saw the bill that was slipped under the door). Now, if the roommate had been sharing the room with anyone else on the trip, the room would have been $100 and his share would have been $50, so he wasn&apos;t really worse off. Was the roommate a jerk for trying to share in a windfall, or was reservation guy a jerk for trying to make a profit? jsgoddess 11-14-2010, 12:52 PM I have a similar, but true ,situation, and want to see if people see it the same way.

The rooms as a block were the amount of all of the rooms added together divided by the number of people OR the amount of all the rooms added together divided by the number of rooms and each room divided by the number of people in it (if there are uneven numbers per room) . There is no&quot;free&quot;room for one person to get because it&apos;s on the back of all of the other reservations.

The reservation guy was a jerk for ripping off every person on the trip. There&apos;s no difference between the one who actually shared his room and all the rest. The rooms were purchased all as one package, so the total price should have been divided among everyone. PunditLisa 11-15-2010, 06:47 AM Was the roommate a jerk for trying to share in a windfall, or was reservation guy a jerk for trying to make a profit?

Absolutely, he&apos;s a jerk. The only way he&apos;s not a complete jerk in this situation is if he&apos;s in a job that entitles him to substantial discounts at this particular hotel chain, and he booked everyone at the discounted rate. In that circumstance, taking the comped room is still pretty low given that it didn&apos;t cost him anything to get it, but at least everyone benefitted in some way.

However, in your situation, everyone should be entitled to a portion of the discount because it&apos;s a group rate, and without a group, you don&apos;t get the good rate.

I collect points toward free hotel nights by using loyalty credit cards. None of these cards is free because I pay up to $100 per year for them in annual fees. There have been times when I&apos;ve used my points to get free nights for our girls&apos; or couples&apos; weekends away. I don&apos;t profit from this at all. In fact, I take a hit because I don&apos;t charge anything for the use of these points even though I&apos;m paying the annual fees. Rather we take the total bill (after my free nights) and divide it by the number of people.

In fact, one couple in particular has benefitted in the thousands of dollars by getting free airline tickets and free hotel rooms. They haven&apos;t even taken us out to dinner to thank us. :mad: ColdPhoenix 11-15-2010, 07:07 AM I think that Jerry is being quite niggardly to be honest. vBulletin®v3.7.3, Copyright©2000-2012, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.
