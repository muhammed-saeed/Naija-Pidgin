 Appalling Customer Service and Management

 MILRORD, OHIO -- I am a very reasonable person. I am aware that customer service employees are very rarely paid what they are worth in terms of the effort they put into and the abuse to which they may be subjected during their employment. I am also aware that one should not expect gourmet cuisine and extensive personal service when patronizing a quick-service restaurant. However, I do not think it is asking so terribly much that persons working in a purportedly customer-focused industry be expected to at least feign the appearance of being competent and considerate.

 Sadly, at the Milford OH Burger King , almost no employees are capable of displaying competence or consideration to even the most rudimentary degree; I am certain that, however paltry their compensation may be, it far exceeds their merits.

I attempted to use the Milford OH Burger King&apos;s drive-through to obtain breakfast combos for my husband and myself this morning. I placed my order at 0812 and, after paying, was asked by the drive-through attendant to pull to the front of the restaurant where my order would be delivered when ready. I waited in front of the restaurant for 10 minutes, during which time I noted several cars exiting the drive-through with completed orders, as well as six or seven parties obtaining orders from the front counter. Understandably frustrated after a 10 minute wait for &quot;fast food ,&quot; I entered the restaurant to check on the status of my order.

After the cashier&apos;s perfunctory, barely intelligible &quot;Can I help you,&quot; I inquired as to when I might expect my order to be ready. The cashier directed this question to the clearly overtaxed drive-through attendant, who stated that &quot;we&apos;re waiting for hash browns.&quot; I asked if perhaps, since I had been waiting for more than 10 minutes for 2 small hash browns, my order could be completed with the next batch of hash browns, as I had witnessed more than twenty transactions during my 10 minute wait time and I was fairly certain that some of those orders had included hash browns (as they were clearly visible on the trays of patrons choosing to dine in). The drive-through attendant said, &quot;None of those people had hash browns.&quot; I replied that this would not seem to be the case, as several parties had either driven away or sat down with their full orders, some of which had visibly involved hash browns. The drive-through attendant said, &quot;Then they must&apos;ve all ordered before you,&quot; to which I replied &quot;Really?!&quot;

At this point, a young female shouted from the kitchen area, &quot;Is there a problem?&quot; I calmly stated that I had been waiting nearly 15 minutes for two meals, and that I simply wanted to obtain my completed order and leave. This young woman then stated, &quot;Look, ma&apos;am. Here&apos;s how it works. I hafta go in the back to the freezer and get the hash browns, and then I have to cook &apos;em. Everybody who you said already got them was here before you. Okay?&quot; This statement was delivered in such a nasty, snide, and sarcastic manner that my only rational response was, &quot;May I please speak to your manager?&quot;, to which this individual replied, &quot;I am the manager. Assistant manager.&quot; I asked if her general or district manager were available, or if I could please obtain their contact information, and she fired back, &quot;My GM&apos;s right back there, you wanna talk to &apos;er?&quot; After my assent, she yelled, &quot;Hey, Kelly! This NICE LADY at the front wants to talk to ya!&quot;, then turned away from me and began to mimic me and comment about me to one of her coworkers.

The general manager approached me immediately and inquired about my concerns. After listening, she stated that she had only been managing the Milford OH Burger King for two weeks, and there were many issues about which she was concerned regarding personnel, but she couldn&apos;t address them overnight. I greatly appreciated her candor and respectful, appropriate demeanor. I made extremely clear to her that the behaviors exhibited by her assistant manager were grossly inappropriate for a customer service environment, the most troubling being the fact that she was literally speaking disrespectfully and derisively about me to her coworkers within clear sight of myself, her general manager, and the other customers. After some assurances on Kelly&apos;s part that the problems I described were clear to her and were being addressed, the front cashier had assembled my order. Before departing, I thanked the manager for her time and inquired after the identity of the extremely rude, unprofessional, and immature &quot;assistant manager,&quot; and found that her name is Ashley.

I called Burger King&apos;s corporate Consumer Relations line immediately upon returning home and filed a complaint about this incident and, specifically, Ashley the Assistant Manager. After I speak with the owner of the Milford OH Burger King store later today, I believe Ashley may find herself job hunting, and it is my sincere hope that this young female does not seek further employment in any customer-focused environment, as it is not a career for which she is well-equipped.

I will certainly not be returning to the Milford OH Burger King until I have received assurances from both the store&apos;s owner and the corporate consumer relations staff that, in the future, suchlike behavior will not be tolerated by any of the store&apos;s employees, let alone someone in management .

good review. 

 Posted by ript on 2010-10-18 
I applaud your handling of the situation. Too often consumers accept this kind of treatment, grumbling to themselves and others around them, but take no constructive action. Hats off! 

 Posted by Prince-Caesar on 2010-10-18 
That, or if it was me, I would have had to walk away in the event that i may just explode and yell and cuss. I dont have patience for rudeness. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
From sitting in your car in front of the store, could you really see hashbrowns being served on the trays all the way inside the store? Or did you just assume? Other than that, great review! 

 Posted by getoverit on 2010-10-18 
Sounds like you scored some points, well done! Maintaining your composure at times like that can be difficult but is so very important.

It will be interesting to see whether that GM was just blowing smoke, or what. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
Prince: If that is in reference to me, then please note that I commended the OP on a nice review. But we as consumers ourselves and members of a consumer complaint/compliment forum have every right to dissect the statement to properly evaluate the situation. I was just trying to put myself in the eyes of the OP, to help better &quot;see&quot; the situation at hand. She complained that she witnessed several orders of hashbrowns being delivered to both the drive-thru and to the dine-in guests. I only questioned this as an assumption. It has nothing to do with the validity of their complaint towards the rudeness or uncalled-for behavior of the assistant manager. I merely questioned one aspect of the post, which as a member reviewing complaints, I feel I am entitled to, and shouldn&apos;t be branded a villian for it. Shame on you. 

 Posted by Prince-Caesar on 2010-10-18 
If she was in the restaurant, you can see the drive thru window from the front desk area. Ive always had. And they normally have the hashbrown/FF fryer by the window, so she COULD see the hashbrowns being served to drive thru and dining guests. 

 Posted by jktshff1 on 2010-10-18 
Well written review. Bad manners are no excuse. I could also see where there may have been others ahead of the OP, but that is not an excuse for the behavior. Seems to be a very busy ff joint with quite a few problems. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
I disagree. She pulled to the &quot;front&quot; of the restaurant, not to the side and adjacent to the drive-thru window. She would have had to look through the front wall/window, the lobby area, over and around the counter, since the fryers are never directly behind the counter, but as you stated and validated my theory, off to the side by the drive thru. She could not have possibly seen the food being assembled into the drive-thru bags unless she had her nose pressed against the window, which doesn&apos;t seem to be the case since she was in her car. Regardless, I only pointed this out as an assumption she made that she was being passed over while others were being given hashbrowns instead of her. Perhaps she over-reacted and incited the incident? But it still doesn&apos;t excuse the behavior of the assistant manager. Again, from that aspect, it was a very good review. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
She only went inside after the fact...and after her assumption. 

 Posted by Prince-Caesar on 2010-10-18 
she said she was fairly certain the 20 transactions had hasborowns. Since its breakfast, more than like ly I can agree with that statement. Hasbrowns in the morning are like French Fries in the afternoon. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
&quot;fairly certain&quot; is still an assumption nonetheless. Sounds like the weatherman being fairly certain it&apos;s going to rain. We all know how accurate they can be at times! 

 Posted by Prince-Caesar on 2010-10-18 
now wait a minute, PM. Isn&apos;t the pot calling the kettle black here? You&apos;re also assuming you know what she saw. So you&apos;re no better. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
If the OP can sit in her car, parked in the front of the restaurant, and see through the front wall/window, through the lobby, over the counter, and around the corner to the fryer...then I owe both her and you an apology. But I think for now, I&apos;ll bite my tongue on giving that out. 

 Posted by skelly39 on 2010-10-18 
Not to add fuel to the fire, but I can see through the front door of any fast food restaurant when I have to pull ahead. Aside from that, I agree with Prince that it&apos;s a reasonable assumption that at least one person got hash browns. I don&apos;t see why we have to dissect the OP&apos;s story. Unless posters make really outrageous claims, I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt. Besides that, it does not take 15 minutes to make hash browns. 

 Posted by trp2hevn on 2010-10-18 
Ok what if the OP saw, say &quot;certain person A&quot; enter the restaurant after the OP&apos;s order was placed (while waiting 10 minutes in the car), and upon entering the restaurant in which you have to walk through the dining room to get to the counter, the OP sees &quot;certain person A&quot; sitting at a table with their breakfast order that includes hashbrowns. Hopefully this may be a theory that some will accept as to how the OP might have known that other patrons orders were dispensed before the OP&apos;s. 

 Posted by Preacher Man on 2010-10-18 
The discussion was over the OP&apos;s choice of vocabulary. They claimed to have &quot;felt fairly certain&quot;. That is very subjective. It is an assumption. While I would probably make the same assumption if it were me in line, it is still an assumption at the end of the day. 

 Posted by justcuz on 2010-10-18 
What does it matter the choice of words used? She also stated she went inside as she clearly stated in her review, and saw the same thing.

The real issue here was poor customer service. It doesn&apos;t matter if the OP thought everyone else was being served before her and was completely wrong, she was treated poorly. Kudos to the OP for addressing her concerns in a calm, professional manner and for recognizing the manager&apos;s respectful response to her. 

 Posted by bluediamond98 on 2010-10-18 
Kudos to the OP for speaking up and thank you for the well written review. So many times we just swallow this poor treatment and move on. If this happens to you again, I suggest you just request a refund. Do NOT eat the food. Just trust me on that ;-) 

 Posted by Ytropious on 2010-10-18 
OP, there are enough people out of work in this economy. I don&apos;t think you need to hound BK to fire this manager. You have no idea what kind of day she was having. No one deserves to be fired because one person was upset over hash browns. I&apos;ve had complaints and I&apos;ve had compliments. Do I deserve to be fired from my job because someone complained? I don&apos;t think so. As long as the manager is addressed, I don&apos;t think she she have to lose her job over this. 

 Posted by jktshff1 on 2010-10-18 
The employee in question should be disciplined in some manner if this was the way it went down. 

 Posted by Venice09 on 2010-10-18 
This is an excellent review, well-written, easy to follow, great points, everything that makes a review worth reading. I can&apos;t help but agree with your opinions because they are set forth so clearly and believably.

I feel sorry for the new general manager. She certainly has her work cut out for her. I hope she isn&apos;t the one who ends up leaving. It sounds like this location really needs her professionalism and work ethic.

Great job on the review and on the way you handled the problem.

Very helpful on all counts.

BTW, when they ask me to pull up I politely decline. What I find happens is they bring out the order and forget something - no sauces or napkins or straws or sometimes even missing food. Then, as if I have not already been inconvenienced enough, I have to pull back around and come thru again making the food cold. So when they ask me to pull up, I give them the crazy as hell look and say NO, thank you! I&apos;ll just stay right here and roll the window up. They don&apos;t know how to handle that and it usually makes them haul tail on your order to get you out of there before you go postal or something. 

 Posted by bcd on 2010-10-18 
I would expect that more than 5% (one out of twenty) of the breakfast orders include hash browns. It is apparent that the OP’s order was forgotten or neglected. One major drawback to pulling forward and waiting is that part of the order is bagged and getting cold while waiting on the order to be completed. Very good review. 

 Posted by ontario_girl on 2010-10-19 
I don&apos;t necessarily agree with the &quot;pull forward&quot; action but I also see how it&apos;s necessary in certain situations. I used to work in a coffee shop and I&apos;d have one drive-thru customer order 6 sandwich combos, each with different toppings, and 3 medium coffees, 5 large coffees and a dozen donuts. Then the person in the car behind them would order a single coffee. It would kind of suck for the person in the second car to have to wait all that time for the first person&apos;s order to be made, just so they could get one coffee. I would politely request the first car pull forward so I could serve the person in the second car their coffee and they could move on with their day. 

 Posted by Ytropious on 2010-10-22 
Anyone who says no to pulling up is just being inconsiderate to everyone behind them. Happened at Arby&apos;s recently. I was celebrating my promotion at work and went into the drive through for a chocolate turnover. Some jagoff said no to pulling forward and I was forced to wait forever for MY chocolate turnover, which was already done and ready to go. Don&apos;t punish the store, don&apos;t punish the people behind you, don&apos;t have a me me me attitude, just pull forward! YOU wouldn&apos;t want to be trapped behind you. 

 Posted by bcd on 2010-10-22 
Ytropious,

I agree with your comment but prior to paying for an order a customer should be informed that their order will be delayed. 

 Posted by myexperiences on 2010-11-18 
Just out of curiosity, what was your full order? Did you order the hash browns without salt (do they put salt on em, I&apos;m never up early enough for breakfast) which would have caused them to need to make a special new batch, etc...
Could be relevant to how long it took, or even that you saw other (salted) hash browns going out. 

 Posted by LuvBreathing on 2010-11-18 
I went to a local Burger King, and discovered that ordering what I wanted individually, was 22 cents cheaper. The manager told me it would be cheaper to buy the combo. I pointed out that the combo price was higher than the individually-priced items, and he continued to argue with me. I reported this incident to the Corporate Office, and all they did was send me a coupon to get a burger for $1.00. It appears to me that the lack of Customer Service, and non-caring attitude starts at the top. You can tell by past TV Commercials, that BK doesn&apos;t have their act together.. Some commercials were filled with sexual innuendos, and attempted murder by trying to run over the King with a car. Children watch this stuff,and even though I voiced my protest with Burger King, they sent me another $1.00 coupon. They totally lost my business. 

 Posted by Bud_the_Bullet on 2010-11-18 
dbtaylor&gt; That was my point! If that&apos;s how you&apos;d spend your breakfast time, then fine, but don&apos;t condemn everyone else and irrationally stereotype them as fat and lazy. The OP&apos;s post was about service time, and shouldn&apos;t be shunned because they chose a drive-thru breakfast over your organic feast at home. 

 Posted by dbtaylor on 2010-11-18 
momsey the relevance is the act of going inside to make sure you are getting what you order and all this could have been avoided, also believe me when I tell you the drive through orders get bad treatment... why? because 98% just drive away, I prefer face to face contact. My son worked at one of these &quot;fast food places&quot; and what he told me about the drive through food is the reason I stopped using it, and why he quit! 

 Posted by chenbo on 2010-11-18 
I believe I&apos;d have done the same if I received that kind of treatment. Great review. 

 Posted by ript on 2010-11-18 
You can just as easily check your order at the drive-thru before driving off db. 

 Posted by Bud_the_Bullet on 2010-11-18 
I always check mine. I do it very quickly as to not hold up the line, but nonetheless, I will make a quick check to ensure my order is complete and correct. So much easier to deal with it right then and there. 

 Posted by dbtaylor on 2010-11-18 
Bud- true and I&apos;m sorry I do enjoy good service and an occasional breakfast combo, however I do go in sit down and enjoy it. I guess what I&apos;m trying to express is alot of time the fastest way is not always the best bet.... slow down and enjoy the ride 

 Posted by jangleton on 2010-11-19 
I believe that you should get off your car seat, walk the few feet inside and order your food and wait. It is more personable, it allows for some exercise and you may find you get your order faster - I always do! It is so funny to see those come around the same time I walk into the store still not served after I leave with my order.

As you may get from this , I am not too impressed with the fast food nation; oh I go there now and then , but to see people get this kind of food while sitting in their car waiting for it is really disgusting and the height of laziness.

 

 Posted by bluediamond98 on 2010-11-19 
Good for you jangleton! Have you ever worn heels all day? Have you ever had to hold a toddler&apos;s hand and unhitch an infant to go inside and get your food? 

 Posted by jangleton on 2010-11-19 
sorry incrediblelee. Thats different 

 Posted by jktshff1 on 2010-11-19 
What does different have to do with the post. Good post, well written, BK dropped the ball on this one. What is the use of a drive thru if it don&apos;t work? BTW....I do not use drive thru 

 Posted by MacNasty on 2010-11-21 
Burger King is steadily going down the tube, not just in Ohio but New Jersey as well. Suffice it to say that $8 an hour does not buy you much in the way of competent fast food employees. It is a national trend. I am happy to say that the BK restaurant that displayed similiar traits and also served up badly prepared food, went out of business a few months ago. It was located in Somers Point, NJ. 

 Posted by bluediamond98 on 2010-11-21 
Would never have thought Somers Point had a bad ANYthing. It used to be all the rage.
