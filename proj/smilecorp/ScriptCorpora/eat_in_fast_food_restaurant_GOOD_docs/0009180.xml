 Re:weekend pics Fri, 04/17/09 8:35 AM ( permalink ) I love your trailer. One day I will have one. I want a Waymatic. Isn&apos;t that what you have?

Working on a 10x20 canopy with massive signage right now. Also expanding my menu for events.

 Re:weekend pics Sat, 04/18/09 8:22 PM ( permalink ) Well I tell ya, the trailer is a waymatic, its the beer sized one if you look at their web site. I got it last year for rewiring a house after i lost my job. It needed work but now has a health cert. 

I usually sell pretty good .....But I must explain and I&apos;ll try not to sound like Im whining...

The people next to me brought 4 pop up tents, 4 deep fat fryers , a four foot griddle, and about a 4 foot grill. They had about 10 tables to work off. They looked soooo cheesy, little signs hung with bits of bailing wire , the tents were a hazard, people kept sticking their legs/ jeans whatever with wire... Forget everything everyone talks about on road food, they worked out of three freezers on a trailer at the back. They cooked frozen everything, state fair corn dogs, sausage on a stick, footlongs , burgers , cotton candy, fried oreos, mexican , it was endless including Funnel Cakes. Their hygene was so lacking it was incredible, they had turkey legs warming on a grill , the guy would scratch some part of himself then turn the leg, another guy cooking burgers could not help but scratch some part of his head while preparing food. People were attracted to their stand in droves - they were using plastic cups with 2 litre cokes $4 with $1 refills. Snow cones $4.50 ... people kept coming... lines of people... at one point I saw 3 lines with 10 -20 people... turkey legs $6 ....meanwhile I might sell a cake. 

Many times people would come up to them and say &quot; oh this is so good do you know about so and so event &quot; , &quot;can you do this place&quot; - it was breath taking - are you people blind?

I was a little peeved in that when I booked and payed my money to set up the organisers never said &quot; oh by the way there are going to be 2 other stands selling funnel cakes&quot; if I had known maybe I would have done something else or even stayed home.
 They did however have 15 people working the stand so my little profit may have been more than they came out with as they stayed in a hotel the night before , and had 4 trucks to move everything. 
 I talked to a lady next to me the other way she had told me the health permit lady had not come by, that she was glad as she wouldnt have made any money if she had have had to pay the $50 temp. permit.

 So Arnie build that tent -don&apos;t even worry about a helth permit. At events they issue you a temp. permit anyway -if youre out of county.
Just get as much food and drink out there you can- dont worry about the quality and get busy! I am going to drag everything out everytime I go any where and run off a table under my pop-up. I am going to be ready- ready to cook and sell whatever-wherever the gloves have to come off-- lets rumble...   #4

 Re:weekend pics Sun, 04/19/09 10:55 AM ( permalink ) I could see the Tent idea working for anyone at any event. People are going to buy from you once. If the food sucks who cares, you have their money and the next person orders. Herd them up in lines and move them out as fast as you can. This isn&apos;t the way to build a reputation or a quality business, but its the way to make big money at events. The guy that needs to build up a business is the guy that is on the same corner everyday. They can&apos;t fool the same person twice. You need be clean and have quality to have return customers. These places that have tents and have 20 people working the event most likely don&apos;t have people with very much experience. Whoever fits in the apron cooks, The pretty girl takes the order. The people in line only have a few minutes to see whats going on in the tent/kitchen, its the way it goes. If you happen to be lucky enough to see someone picking their pickle, then thats the time we could say, OK everyone lets go someplace else to eat..........   #5

Herd them up in lines and move them out as fast as you can. This isn&apos;t the way to build a reputation or a quality business, but its the way to make big money at events. 

I’m not sure your correct in your thoughts on: “People are going to buy from you once. If the food sucks who cares, you have their money and the next person orders.”

First, I think it depends on what type of event your doing, and more importantly it will kill your next year’s business. People still talk at events and often to other people they don’t even know. It’s not uncommon to hear a person ask another (total stranger) if they like what they’re eating. Or where they got what they’re eating if it looks good. 
 
I will be the first to say a crowd draws a bigger crowd and if I’m doing an event and only have one customer at the window my crew knows to slow down in preparing that order so that others see we have customers. Once we get more than 3 people in line we kick it in gear to keep the line moving.
 
Jack with all due respect, your trailer looks sort of bland with just the banner. I’d look into some sort of wrap for the front of your trailer with some large pictures of your products. Most of you think I’m harping on the picture thing but look at any fast food restaurant, they have tons of pictures. I ate breakfast today at Perkins, and they have 2 pictures per page on a big menu. And go to one of these places and check out the pictures on the menu: Bennigan’s, Dairy Queen, Denny’s, Hardee’s, Ihop, Long John Silvers, McDonald’s, Olive Garden, Sonic Drive In, Steak and Shake, or Subway.
 
And if you have the help send someone out into the crowd handing out small samples of your product. Or put up a small sign that reads free samples, but make it, so it’s easily taken down when you get busy.
 
There are other tricks that work well if the event people will let you get away with it: buy a carper scrap 20 X 10 (doesn’t matter what color or quality) and some good padding, both are cheap. Tape the pad down and then the carper over the pad right in front of your window. If you use (Duck) gray tape and do it right it won’t be a safety hazard and with the longer measurement sticking out into the crowd people will walk from the asphalt onto your carpet and know instantly that their feet feel better. It also makes your customers in line feel more comfortable while waiting for service.
Put up an extra tent in front of your stand with a couple of tables and chairs for your customers to eat at. I often put a fan or two out there but then you have to use 3 foot wide carpet rolls to cover the cords running out to the tent. I also put a sign up stating that the seating is for Dr of BBQ customers only. But if there is no one else using that area I don’t insist on this.
 
Just some thoughts that may help.
Jack

 Re:weekend pics Sun, 04/19/09 7:45 PM ( permalink ) I wouldn&apos;t serve or sell a product that I wasn&apos;t proud of, regardless of the venue. Before I would serve a lousy product, I&apos;d find something else to do. &lt;message edited by PopsDogHouse on Sun, 04/19/09 7:49 PM&gt;   #7

 Re:weekend pics Sun, 04/19/09 10:24 PM ( permalink ) I experienced the same as you last event. I was making a little money with my small shiney hot dog cart while the 10x20 canopy folks had lines. I just didn&apos;t have a &quot;presence&quot;.

I&apos;m working myself into a regular at local events and will eventually open a place one day so my quality and service needs to be top notch 24/7.

Besides having a larger variety of foods to offer , my canopy setup will introduce me to new equipment and cooking techniques needed for my expanding menu. This in turn will prepare me for opening my own place one day.

I believe lots of pictures of your offerings and quality food and service will bring people in. You have to look like a big time operator to make big money. Big menu, flashy signs, unique foods..... it all plays a part. Marketing is king. You have to suck them in through sight from long distances , you have to stick out from the crowd.

I&apos;ll post pics of my setup when I&apos;m done. It will be at least a month or so.

Sent you an IM.

 Re:weekend pics Sun, 04/19/09 11:25 PM ( permalink ) I&apos;ve got to jump in here because we do nothing but events and our customers are not just one timers. We work events in a 100 mile radius and a lot of craft shows, small fairs and city festivals. I&apos;ve had people come up and say, &quot;I had one of your Buffalo&apos;s over at the XYZ fair and it was great.&quot; I&apos;ve had people get on their cell phone and call their friends while at our trailer and tell them, &quot;I found that place that sells the fantastic hot dogs. It&apos;s over by the XYZ&quot; 

My point is, in the rural areas and smaller communities many people will spend their weekends going to different festivals or fairs thqat are close. If you have a clean professional set up that sells quality food they will remember you. If you sell crappy food out of a roach coach, they will remember that also.  Never assume you have a customer for one shot only or you may be looking for another line of work, REAL QUICK. Just my opinion.

And also my lunch crowd knows my product and buys from me at the small street festivals that I do. Have to serve a quality product. Everybody does Dogs but the Sausage grabs them all the time.  I make out when other vendors crying the blues. I use a 10x10 at these street fairs instead of umbrella. I am going to do a new festival later in the year and the organizers suggest a tent instead of trailer.
Nothing but fried food.

Hey Mike, and DR you are both right. You and many, many others in this site care and have pride in your product. There is always a booth at all the fairs that have a large menu serving everything from corn dogs grease burgers and elephant ears. They have a butcher paper menu and dirty aprons. The people that come up and tell you they love your food are the repeats from other events. It is also because you have a quality product. .................Bill   #11

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 11:39 AM ( permalink ) I&apos;ve run into this same problem, me with nice trailer, professional banners and signs, printed menu next to the exact operation you were. They had lines, a menu you couldn&apos;t even read with absolutely no sanitation with sand blowing in the food. This is my thinking ... I get this from when I do a Ribeye sandwich, people like to &quot;watch the show&quot;, they see people out there cooking, also they quite simply think you&apos;ll be more expensive because of the trailer. I learned something long ago while taking portraits at a walmart loooong ago, they had a childrens fashion show and after the event was over they threw all the clothes in a basket to be put back on the racks later. There was no sign, the people at the show had long left, but you would not believe the people that went through that basket looking for clothes because they thought they where on sale, I think for a lot of people it&apos;s perceived value.
I think the Dr&apos;s suggestions are good, this is a way of inviting people into your booth and making people stop and look. It&apos;s like seeing cars in the restaurant parking lot, must be good a lot of people are there. I&apos;m considering for the next big show, the &quot;thrilla with the grilla&quot;. The concept is basically putting on a show. Ez-up in front on the trailer with my 6ft grill cooking hamburgers, sausage on a stick etc. While Im cooking I can interact with the crowd, maybe do some &quot;benny hanna&quot; tricks to entertain the passers by. When people want food you just direct them to the window where the order is placed and prepared.
Don&apos;t get discouraged, I know I have been, just use that ingenuity and come up with something better than the other guy.

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 12:29 PM ( permalink ) Big Red,
Your so on target with the show part. I call it smoke and fire. If you can show the crowd Smoke and Fire, they will eat. I’m just getting done with a flat top grill on a 4 foot by 4 foot trailer that I’m building that will be parked right by my food service window. I’ll load it up with green peppers and onions, and do hot dogs, sausages, and rib eye steaks on it. I wanted it built on a trailer frame so that I had something to use at smaller parties, instead of dragging around my big trailer and smoker. And I’m always looking for a method to make my set up easier, so I just had a trailer built to haul this thing around and use it straight off the trailer, I don’t want to be worn out before I even start serving food.
 
One other thought that may get thrown into the mix, last year after one of our local events I had a very long chat with the event manager, and explained I wasn’t coming back because I knew for a fact that 5 or 6 of the vendors didn’t carry insurance. I also noted that the custom of people renting space and inviting friends down to cook and drink was costing the event money because those folks were giving away food too not only their friends but also too anyone that walked by. If I’m not selling food then the event doesn’t get their percentage.
 
So long story short this year no insurance and you don’t get in. Also if you’re cooking on a charcoal grill, deep frying anything, or using a flat top, outside of your trailer you have to be in an enclosed tent. But to me that’s not a big deal, it just requires an easy up with the screens attached to the sides. That will hopefully put a bunch of the weekend wonders out of business. No one will be allowed to just set up a tent and throw up some tables and start selling food, at least not at that event.
 
Jack
PS if I were in your shoes I’d talk to the event managers and explain just how unsanitary the tent, table, lawn chair groups really are. And there is always the HD to talk with on the same subject.

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 4:12 PM ( permalink ) Great information!

Maybe I&apos;ll configure my 10x20 canopy in a way that allows the customers to &quot;come in&quot; out of the sun and order. Until this thread started, I figured I&apos;d just throw up a counter and the entire covered area would be for me.

In ya&apos;lls experience for a 10x20 spot in events, is there a standard configuration? Are most spots configured for a 20&apos; deep area or 20&apos; wide? I would hope 20&apos; wide.

I believe JackSnacks believes in quality and was just saying that in jest.

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 6:04 PM ( permalink ) Most I have worked are 10 feet deep and then 10 feet or 20 feet wide. But I have also noticed they don&apos;t seem to mind you setting up a tent that is in front of the trailer for customers to line up under. The space that is in front of your service area is for your customers so what does it matter if you tent it? In fact as I wrote in another thread tent and carpet it.

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 7:02 PM ( permalink ) I am delighted with your responses, I agree the trailer looks bland. I have thought of one design I think will appeal to my target audience, and I will need to spend a little time sorting it out. 
As far as the food quality I always buy the best I can afford as more than likely my family and I will be eating it too. I addressed the problems with the organisers at the time I was there, as far as too many of the same items.
I have no main point nor an argument to put forth , I wanted to show how sometimes your expectations can be severely curtailed. I will not, in the future, limit myself to two items. I will setup my tent and trailer and prepare to sell everything I can. I am thinking definitely of a deep fat fryer in addition to an industrial griddle. I have to become more competitive.
 This next weekend I have another event and I must make a lot of changes.
Some more photo&apos;s:
 
 
 
 
 
The top left photo is the carny food stand , the carnies were in a price war , the top right shows my neighbors signage , the one below shows the lines, and the other two tables show a condiment table were people could put their own stuff on and the last table shows a display of the food they sold.

I set up my 10x10&apos; EZup at the end of my 7x12 trailer. I actually take up a space that is 10x24, (including the tongue) but have never had a sponsor complain. If it is a bigger event and there isn&apos;t a space problem, I set up a second 10x10&apos; and put my condiment bar and pop barrels under it. The customers order at the window then come to me to pick up the burgers and dogs. Other things are sold from inside the trailer. I put up 2 or 3 side panes, depending on the wind and set my 6&apos; grill toward the front.
 
If we get slow, I throw on one of my special burgers. I normally take with me about a dozen of the fattiest, cheapest burgers I can find, just for this. I put one on, run the grill up to MAX and let the flames and smoke roll. In a mater of minutes I have a line formed and I go back to the good burgers and the crappy one goes in the trash. I keep a small fan at the back of the EZup and it&apos;s not my fault if it blows the smoke toward the people walking by. LOL Being out in the open I keep up a running conversation about the weather, politics, kids, grandkids, fishing, jokes, and a ton of other things. A lot of times I have several people standing around the grill, eating their burgers and visiting with each other. They appreciate the interaction and at times I have to politely ask them to move on and make room for others.
 
If we are there for multi days, I just zip up all 4 sides, lock the trailer and leave it. So far we have never had anyone bother anything during the night. I DO NOT repack everything when I close for the day. IMHO the combination a trailer/tent works far better than a bigger trailer. People like to see their food cooking. The only drawback is with the large grill, pop barrels and everything else we need I have had to go to a 2nd trailer which is 6x12 just to haul my buns and supplies. That means we have to take 2 vehicles but, for us, it is worth it.

 Re:weekend pics Mon, 04/20/09 11:07 PM ( permalink ) Kewl!
I had decided to put the a/c in the trailer with mama - she can take the orders and money. Then we were covered also with the health dept with all the sinks and such. Using the trailer to haul as much of the stuff in it but the breaking it out for the setup. I can see needing a huge roof storage for the supplies or getting the school bus ready for the road!! I have a 16x8 foot trailer we could put the concession trailer on plus a couple of big freezers and run them on an inverter or generator.

Like you, I put an AC in the trailer for mama and she handles all the money, takes the order and calls it out to me. The trailer has all the sinks and such which makes the HD happy. So far they haven&apos;t complained about my cooking outside because I&apos;m always wearing gloves. However, if they do I&apos;ll mount a small single hand sink to the end of the trailer and plumb it to the hot/cold water system inside by drilling 2 small holes in the trailer and draining it into a portable waste tank outside. That was suggested by one HD inspector but he didn&apos;t require it.
