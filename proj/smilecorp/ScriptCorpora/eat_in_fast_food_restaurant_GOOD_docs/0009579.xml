Bruschetta Burgers
 Posted in Beef , Family Favorites , Grilling , Main Dish , Quick Weeknight Meals , Sandwiches, Burgers, Wraps&amp;Quesadillas 
 

As our moving date gets closer, we are getting busier with packing and seeing friends before we leave.  This means fast dishes are essential, especially at lunch time.  These burgers served up a fantastic quick meal the other day when we had only a moment to spare and grab a bite to eat.  To help quicken the pace, I bought the meat already shaped into patties, and it didn’t hurt that they were on sale.  After all ingredients were factored in, the burgers totaled less than $1.00 each!  And, trust me, you can’t find a Bruschetta Burger on any of those fast food restaurants’value menus for $1.00! It’s worth every penny to take the time to grill it yourself and slap on some cheese and tomatoes at the end.

Although the original recipe gives ingredients for a rub, I used some hamburger seasoning I had on hand.  You can do the same, or just refer to the original source to make your own.

Bruschetta Burgers

 Printable Recipe 

Yield: 4 burgers

4 burger patties
hamburger seasoning, to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
2 Tbsp basil, shredded
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp minced garlic
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
4 hamburger buns
spread butter
garlic salt, to taste

Preheat grill.  In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, oil, garlic, salt and pepper, stir in the basil; set aside.  Season hamburgers with choice of hamburger seasoning.  Grill until cooked through, flipping only once.  After flipping burgers, top each with about one tablespoon of the mozzarella cheese and one tablespoon of the tomato mixture.  Continue to grill until the cheese is melted.  In the meantime, butter the buns and sprinkle with garlic salt.  Toast on the grill for a few minutes.

Assemble the burgers and serve with choice of condiments.  I prefer to eat mine as is, no extras. YUM!

I’ve been making these for the last few weeks, ever since I found your recipe. Your recipe is missing the basil but that’s OK.

I season my burgers with a pinch, each, of coriander and curry, and I add thyme to the tomato mix. Try it out; I’m told it’s pretty darn good!

 Hi Brandon. Thanks for the notice about missing the basil! I’ve been so caught up with moving cross country that I missed it! Just updated it, though. I’m definitely going to give your version of spices a try!
