Psychology and Nightlife II
 7:30 a.m. I have to wake up early today for my psychology class!

8:00 a.m. Get out the door, head out to school.

Of course I stop into my favorite Der Mann at the Kaisermuhlen station. I always get two topfenbaellchen, which are little balls of dough covered in sugar, and a cafe latte. It is always a nice cheap little pick me up in the morning, and it has become a lovely tradition that makes me feel so at home here in Vienna. :)

9:00 a.m. I have psychology class, but I forgot that my class is going to be happening for the next SIX hours! Usually it is a four hour class, but since we missed a class for easter, we have to make up for it bit by bit by adding extra time to our remaining classes.

But here is the problem: I forgot to tell Kim that my class is ending later, and we always meet up after my class! Also, as a side note, out cell phone is not working.

12:00 p.m. We have been in class for a while and we take a break. It is a really good group of kids, and we are all becoming friends.

1:00 p.m. This is the time that my class would normally get out, so I check around the building quickly but Kim is nowhere to be found. I worry that maybe she slept in, or that she came here to find me and got confused and left.

At this point, the whole class is very tired, who wouldn&apos;t be after four hours of psychology? We still had two hours left.

3:00 p.m. Class finally ends! It was a fun class, but no matter how good a class is, six hours is just too long.

So I managed to get in contact with Kim with Rita&apos;s iPhone, on facebook! What a blessing! She had come to school and looked for me, and had returned home after she could not find me.

So a group of us from my class decided to go out to lunch together, and Kim and I made plans via facebook to meet up afterward!

We decided to eat at Vapiano, an Italian semi-fast-food restaurant. When you walk in you get a card, then you get a tray and silverware and step into line so that one of the chefs can make a creation for you right there in front of you!

I got campanelle in pesto sauce with pine nuts. It was delicious. After you eat, you take the card you recieved at the beginning (and swiped after getting your food) up to the cashier and pay right before leaving.

The group was six people: Rita, J, Anar, Monika, Jacob, and me! It always baffles me how many nationalities there are in one place! Everyone was from a different country!

After lunch I got met up with Kim, and we walked back to school together, very happy to see each other! She worked on her painting, while I figured out how to work the internet in the computer lab. I had a lovely facebook chat with my boyfriend, and then went back to the art room where Kim showed me how to paint! I am not very talented, but it definitely was fun!

7:30 p.m. We decide to try stepping off into a new station and trying dinner at a place we had never been to before! We ended up at a fast food restaurant called Mr. Lee&apos;s! It was cheap, and we got so much food!  Rita met up with us there, and then we all met with Anar, and some new friends of his and went to a place called Luke&apos;s bar!

It was really nice, a big open space with tables. The problem was that all the tables were reserved! We eventually did find a place to sit. We all ordered the same thing to drink because the drinks we asked for were apparently not available!

We talked with our new friends, until about midnight then headed out!

It was a very chill night, but we had to get up in the morning for a new adventure!

1:00 a.m. Skyping with Matt, Colby, and Nora!!! Then skyping with just Matt! Then bed!

Goodnight
