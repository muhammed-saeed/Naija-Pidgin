Better picks for 2006

JUDGMENT day has arrived on the outcome of our tipping efforts for 2005 and it has to be acknowledged that we found it a tough year.

The Footsie 100 index, which began the year at about 4800, climbed to 5500 in early autumn, slumped, then rebounded above 5600 - the best level since 2001, though well short of its end-1999 peak of 6930.

But the gains were uneven. Oil and mining shares surged, led by rampant demand from China. Some other sectors did less well - banks rose only modestly. Hotel and leisure shares - hit by new terror attacks - hardly rose at all and retailers were subdued.

So was our own performance. Seven of the nine shares tipped rose, but two fell sharply, dragging down the end-year gain on the portfolio to 3%. Including dividends would almost double this, but it was disappointing after the previous two years, when our tips rose 27% and 21%, well ahead of the market.

If you followed our &apos;stop loss&apos; advice set out this time last year - to sell if a share dropped by 20% - the return would have been much better at 13%, not far behind the 17% gain on the Footsie 100.

This is not to excuse our performance. We have tried to do better in our 2006 selections. But the out-turn - seven gains almost wiped out by two big losses - will echo many investors&apos; experience with their own portfolios. It is so important to cut your losses. Decide in advance that if any share you buy - including those tipped here - falls by 20%, you will sell.

This will be equally important in 2006. Globally, terrorism and political instability are among the worries. Can Asia&apos;s remarkable growth continue? Will UK consumers regain their spending power?

My own choice for 2005 was property group Wichford . It traded well, and is delivering the hoped-for 9p annual dividend. But the gain was a modest 6% to 184½p. With a dividend yield near 5%, it remains a solid hold.

For 2006 I am choosing a telecom stock, though the industry has over-invested.

 Cable&amp;Wireless shares have fallen a long way from 1470p in 2000 to 119¼p. That values the group at£2.8bn - a tiddler compared to BT (£19bn), Vodafone (£78bn), or, more to the point, Deutsche Telekom (£40bn) or Telecom Italia (£32bn).

Yet it has the second-largest fixed telecoms network in the UK, an internet &apos;backbone&apos;, and, following the£594m purchase of Energis, more than 20% of the business telecoms market. It has an exotic spread of operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco - handy for board meetings.

All this means revenues of£3.5bn, cash flow last year of£346m and a useful cash pile.

Past strategy has been erratic. But if chairman Richard Lapthorne and his team hit their target of building the UK business to£2bn sales and 10% margins, Cable looks very cheap. 
Continental predators will surely agree.



 Tips from the Daily Mail business writers 

 Next - Alex Brummer 

AN end-of-year surge in household spending and signs of a modest recovery in house prices point to a better year for the economy in 2006. The Chancellor and the IMF expect a 2.25% expansion.

Providing inflation remains subdued, we can expect the Bank of England to give growth a helping hand by lowering interest rates from 4.5%.

Last year I chose an international stock, GlaxoSmithKline, which made good and steady progress as it won increasing recognition for its drug and vaccines pipeline. Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier has gone a long way towards refocusing attention on GSK&apos;s research strengths, after the diversions caused by perceived governance failures.

This year, as the consumer returns, I am plumping for retail. Next had a torrid time in 2005, no doubt hurt by the Marks&amp;Spencer recovery story. But over the years Simon Wolfson has demonstrated leadership and the ability to bounce back against the odds. Though Christmas trading may have been tough, Next has all channels covered with a strong online offering, and expanding High Street and edge-of-town space.

 Intec - James Ashton 

WITH landline calls being packaged with internet access, and mobile operators charging an array of tariffs, phone bills are harder to keep track of - not least for the companies that compile them. That is where Intec Telecom Systems comes in.

Its billing software measures call times and calculates bills for clients including Virgin Mobile, although 90% of its business is overseas.

Analysts upgraded profit forecasts after strong full-year results in December. Intec is trading on 17 times this year&apos;s earnings and 14 times next year&apos;s - below the 19 times average of the software sector.

Takeover talk could boost the shares. Two of Intec&apos;s largest peers have recently been bought, one by IBM. At the right price, US venture capitalist General Atlantic, which has a 26% stake after part-funding Intec&apos;s acquisitions, could be persuaded to cash out.

Incisive Media, last year&apos;s tip, tailed off in the second half. It still grew faster than its peers in the last six months and is worth holding.

 Earthport - Geoff Foster 

IT should soon be all systems go for Earthport, at 42p. The Aim-listed electronic payment services group moves customer money on command, tracks the transaction and keeps an audit trail.

A strategic review by the newlystrengthened management created an ambitious marketing team which has already landed new clients.

Two deals which should greatly enhance prospects could happen in early 2006. The first is believed to be an exciting joint venture with electronic wallet group, NETeller.

The second is a licensing deal with an international debit card group interested in Earthport&apos;s &apos;virtual purse&apos; - which can be loaded with cash from a credit card and used to buy goods online without customers having to provide their card details each time. Worth a punt.

Recommended at 25½p, my 2005 nap GB Group touched 42p at one point and is now 34p. Broker Numis has a 69p target price on the prospect of new contract wins. Hold.

 Forth Ports - James Quinn 

WHAT a year for the ports sector. With P&amp;O, Mersey Docks and PD Ports all sailing off into the takeover sunset, the remaining quoted ports companies are firmly in the spotlight.

Forth Ports, my tip for the top in 2005, did not attract a foreign suitor, but it did well nonetheless. Recommended at 1347p, it rose 19%. 
That was helped by recent speculation on a private equity bid, but the Takeover Panel would have forced Forth to confirm this by now if the story was true.

It still has a sizeable land bank - owning 170 acres at the Port of Leith, Edinburgh. Rather than sell land piece by piece, it plans to manage it alongside developers to ensure maximum returns. This should deliver more value in 2006.

 Compass - Tes sa Thorniley 

CATERER Compass had a stinker of a year in 2005 - but the bulls reckon the shares will gain 20% this year, even without the rumoured bid.

Based on growth in the US, the benefits of UK restructuring and the sale of the SSP travel concessions side for north of£1bn, 2006 looks set to be a year of transition.

When a new boss comes in, Compass will seek to put the Turkey Twizzlers scandal , the US probe into United Nations contracts and the supplier &apos;bugging&apos; allegations all behind it.

If trading holds up, analysts expect a chunk of the SSP sale proceeds to be returned to shareholders, a held dividend and healthy cash flow.That will give the shares strong support.

 Lloyds TSB - Ruth Sunderland 

I AM taking another flutter on the Black Horse this year. I tipped Lloyds TSB at 473p last time on hopes of a takeover bid. Sadly, this did not arrive during the 12 months, and it finished at 488½p.

Rival banking executives believe it is a case of when, rather than if, a bidder descends. Lloyds is on the road to sorting out its Scottish Widows insurance division, which this year paid its first dividend to its parent. That removes one obstacle to a bidder. Possible predators include BBVA of Spain or a big American bank.

Lloyds has a formidable pension fund deficit, a deterrent to a buyer. But if the bank is forced to go it alone, it is at least showing signs of getting its house in order under new retail supremo Terri Dial, and has a very decent yield of 7%.

 PartyGaming - Ian Lyall 

WITH last year&apos;s tip - Phytopharm - I warned that the stock was not for widows and orphans. Sadly true. Undeterred I am gambling again in 2006 - but this time on a FTSE 100 constituent.

For those who bought in summer&apos;s float, PartyGaming has been a rollercoaster. I am hoping that the City&apos;s greater understanding of its business and recent innovations will iron out that volatility and act as a catalyst for growth.

Since the nadir of 70p in October after its second profit warnings, the shares have bounced back with a vengeance, rising well above the 116p float price.

Brokers think there is still some way to go. New games such as blackjack and easier ways of gambling should boost profits. Party has also booted rival companies off its virtual gaming tables. City research suggests the shares are worth anything from 160p to 200p.

Should the US authorities clamp down on internet gaming, life would become much tougher. But so far they show little inclination to shut down the industry and may even legalise and tax it.

 Wm Morrison - Lucy Farndon 

WM MORRISON is my pick for 2006. After a torrid 18 months and five profit warnings, I finally believe the supermarket business is on the way up.

Chairman Sir Ken Morrison has accepted the need for a young, thrusting chief executive to galvanise staff. The search is under way. If they do not get the right person then a bid is likely.

Though the shares are relatively highly rated, a huge profit improvement could come through when the recovery gets going. This will take time, but I think investors will start pricing it in by the second half of 2006.

Market share has started to stabilise and, after poor 2005 sales numbers, improvements will be obvious. Despite all the problems, Sir Ken will not rest until the business is back on track. Credit Suisse forecasts profits of£83m this year, rising to£300m next and£500m the year after.

My tip last year, Aim-listed ArmorGroup, ended down a dismal 54%. It had a promising start - investors who sold out in April could have made a 66% gain. But delays to payments on contracts and negative press coverage sent the price spiralling lower in the second half.

The &apos;stop loss&apos; we recommended would have capped your loss at 20%. Anyone who still has the shares should hold for a bounce.
