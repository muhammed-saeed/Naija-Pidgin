What is more comforting than a bowl of porridge? The addition of yummy side dishes.

Second time coming here with friends and it has yet to disappoint me. Recommendations: Tofu with Perserved Eggs, Napa Cabbage, Eggplant and Dried Bean Curd. But everything goes well with the porridge!

Try this place if you&apos;re in the area!

I liked place since the first time I went there, though a little confused at the beginning of how to order. The food was not bad, and the porridge is really nice!

I&apos;m quite into porridge when the weather&apos;s hot, but don&apos;t have much patience to make it myself. Or sometimes I just feel like eating porridge with some veggies when I wake up.  It&apos;s good I found one here!

What I like most there is definitely the cabbage--seems really easy to make, but no matter how hard I try, it just doesn&apos;t taste as good as theirs! The other food is average, but relatively cheap, so overall I&apos;m pretty happy with them.

I used to come here with my cousin. We loved the cheap price and tasty side dishes. But!!!! one day after we ate there, we had some left over and asked for the to go box for the side dishes and the porridge. The waitress said we have to pay extra for the porridge if we want to take it home. We told her, we&apos;re just gonna take the left over porridge in the big red bowl that she served us with. Then she said &quot;oh you still have to pay $1, because we put the porridge back in the pot.&quot;
We&apos;re like &quot;WTF!!!!&quot;, we were shocked, didn&apos;t know what to say. I guess the waitress realized that she spilled the restaurant&apos;s &quot;secret&quot;. She quickly said, &quot;oh oh it&apos;s okay, you can take the porridge home.&quot;
Yeah ..... so we left, didn&apos;t even take our side dishes home and never go back ever since.

Ate here for lunch. The service was rude. The side dishes were pretty good. I&apos;d recommend the minced pork, green beans, tea eggs, and the bok choy.

The porridge itself is totally bland and tasteless.

The hot tea was good because it had a ton more flavor than the porridge did.

The service absolutely sucked salty balls... hmmm i bet those have more flavor than the porridge too.

Would i come back here? &quot;Eek! Methinks not.&quot;

I have not the words for the this place.  Seriously, there are no words I understood in the menu or outside, or anywhere (all in Chinese!).  Well, ok, there were a few words.  Words like the name of the place, and &quot;Lunch Special - pick three&quot; were about all I was about to make out.

Now, food can be a universal language, and as much, all I did was point at all kinds (well, three of all kinds) of foreign things and just saw my plate fill up.

When I got to a table, they gave me a bowl of sweet potato rice porridge, and I was in Taiwanese food heaven.

Definitely a return lunch visit will happen.

Grilled salty fish (mackerel?), mustard greens, garlicky cucumber and carrot salad.

Big bowl of porridge studded with yam/sweet potato pieces.

MM-MMMM-YUMMM.

Now *this* is the perfect comfort food, on a grey threatening overcast day like today.

Bonus:  Taiwanese being spoken at the next table.

Ahhhhh.  Feels kind of like childhood.

I&apos;m not crazy about porridge in general, but this stuff hits the spot sometimes i.e. when it&apos;s freezing out. Always crowded during weekend dinner times...pop in during an off hour if you hate waiting.  I come here every so often because a few of my family members love porridge.

So, here&apos;s how it works...you go up to the counter and point at whatever stuff you want. Some of it looks scary, but most of it tastes good.  You can&apos;t really go wrong with any of the tofu dishes.

Then, you sit down at your table and they bring you a big pot of porridge with yam inside.  You can put all your food into the porridge and eat it..or like..whatever, you know?  Eat it however you prefer!

This place is pretty unique when it comes to Asian/Chinese food cos there aren&apos;t too many porridge places around.  Not the kinda Taiwanese place where you see (m)any non-Asians...I&apos;m Filipino and i&quot;ve been coming here for years.  I&apos;ve always gotten just OK service, but no big complaints.

Perfect place for comfort food!

Atmosphere: Very casual. You can either order to go or eat there.

Food: They have most side dishes you would expect at a porridge place. My favorites are: green bean + minced pork, edamame beans + tofu, eggplant and pork belly + bell pepper.

Cost: For $6.50 you get 3 side dishes and the choice of rice or porridge for lunch.

This place is perfect for rainy/cold days or weekend brunch.

If you&apos;re going for lunch, I would recommend going 11:30 to avoid the lunch rush.

I normally come here on weekday lunches and really like this place.
They have a lunch special for around $6 to get 3 items with porridge.

I came for the first time at night and it was BAD!!!
They didn&apos;t have the eggplant dish I normally get.
I got leftover porridge and it was much different from all the porridge I got at lunch.  They charge $1 to take home leftover porridge because they serve your leftover porridge to other customers.

PROS: Good food and lots of choices.
Cheap during Lunch Special on weekdays.

CONS: Expensive at night and weekends.
Combines leftover porridge to server to new customers.

Oh man, where to even start?  The porridge here is fantastic--love that it comes with yams--and all of the side dishes are fresh to death.   I&apos;ve been here several times (two times with my gramma, who is totally OG), and have yet to have a bad meal here.

It&apos;s nothing flashy--just good old fashioined comfort food.  Taiwanese style (aka baller-style)

Yes, the service can be a little lacking, especially if you come here during off-peak hours (say 3pm), but the food makes up for it.   The parking in Cupertino Village also sucks.  Ugh, I would definitely come here more often if I didn&apos;t hate parking there so much.  Seriously.  It&apos;s like California just handed out drivers licenses to everybody and anybody.

So, anyways..

You can also get the food to-go, which is like magic to me.  Oh man, there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;m stopping by here for dinner tonight.  Yum, yum, yum.

Pig Parts Guy here.

Oinkity bump!!!

(\____/)

( (  (oo)  ) )
` - . U  . - &apos;

Today at lunch: for $6.50 (tax included, ca$h only) you pick any three items from their steam table. Then you automatically get charged $0.60 a person (whoa I thought they used to charge $1 per person??) for unlimited servings of their Taiwanese style congee/porridge (chi faan or tsing zho) which contain chunks of orange yam/sweet potato.

The porky steal of the century!  If you like A$N nasty bit$ off the porky carcass, then look no further.

Also these guys stepped up their game in the steam table offering quality.

- simmered pig feet (very tasty) especially the skin part. A tad bit boney though, but where you can, try to pry out the bone marrow for oinkstra pleasure

- boiled pig intestines, interestingly shaped like big macaroni. After scooping this $hizzle up, they drizzle soy paste sauce, a little vinegar and ...garlic juice(?) over it. A little QQ/toothy/bouncey, but nothing the Pigs Part Guy can&apos;t handle.

- Hai dai, aka seaweed. Looks like the green jelly in those Vietnamese dessert drinks, except dark green. A little vinegar and soy marination goes a long way, went down great with the hot congee

- sour cabbage stir fried with thin slices of pork stomach. Woof woof woof! Looked fugly and unappetizing, but the combination of textures was woot woot oinky.

- thin slices of cooked bitter melon. Great for breaking down all that cholestrol. Less guilt after Pig Parts Guy stuffed the hell outta himself

- stir fried bamboo shoots (an absolute must)

OK I think I grossed a lot of you out.

But that&apos;s ok

This is the Taiwanese and high tech slave&apos;s everyday commoner&apos;s meal.
Quick, fast, CHEAP. And H3LLA delishiosho. Best of all filling, but light.

I mean from $1 to now $0.60 per person for unlimited Taiwanese style congee. That&apos;s cheaper than $1 per person tea at dim $um!

The sad part is that you cannot just order one lunch special and share between 2 persons (believe me I tried...).

Wall special STILL advertises their xiaolongbao, which is fine if you don&apos;t care about quality. Cheaper than HC dumpling house next door and likely nowhere near as refined (even though HC fugged it up big time the other day....). So my advice is to skip it.

It appears they offer Taiwanese style oyster omlette at less than $5. Try at your own risk.

If you don&apos;t like the pig parts, they have pig stomach slices (whoops), various vegetable based offerings, soy sauce marinated hard boiled eggs, squid, lion&apos;s head meatballs, amongst a few others.

$6.50 for 3 items of your choosing + $0.60 for unlimited refills of congee = $7.10.

Now tell me what can you get for $7.10 that gives you a happy ending (no not THAT kind) during lunch in Cupertino Village?

- Joy Luck Place? Fugghitabbaaaadit. You&apos;re out $25 dim $olo.

- TottyMelon Fromo and gelato? Only if you are on a lacto sugar only &quot;diet&quot;

- A&amp;J? Sheeeeeeit, their signature spicy beef noodle soup is already at the $7 mark and I can still eat afterwards!

- The sichuan place? Naaaah

- The Guandong place? Errrrm not so sure

-Quickly/Fantasia/Tapioca X? doh....

-99 Ranch steam table Chinese? HELL No! Cheap yes, but good? Nah.

It can get uber busy during lunchtime at this cheap fast good tasty porridge place. If you don&apos;t mind sharing a table, you could be set quite quickly.

My kind of fast food.

Wit da Pig Part$.

Wurd.

How have I not reviewed this place yet?? I come here all the time. A warning, though: if you&apos;re not Chinese, this place will be a bit of a culture shock. Not only in terms of language; the servers don&apos;t even try to give you good service, but will still chase you down if you don&apos;t leave a tip. But the food is cheap and good, if oily.

When you walk in, a lady will ask you how many and tell you which table you&apos;re sitting at. Then, at the front, you pick out the dishes; during lunch, 3 for a lunch special, and during dinner, individually. Finally, they insist that you sit down (the only thing making this place a sit-down restaurant, and therefore the only real reason there&apos;s tip) and they bring you your food and a ton of porridge with sweet potato, along with some hot tea. At the end, you pay at the front.

The lion&apos;s head meatballs, Chinese sausage, napa cabbage, bamboo shoots, ground beef sauce, dried tofu strips, and egg fried with pickled radish (the last is from the all-Chinese menu on the back wall) are all good. Everything is best with steaming hot porridge.

Blame Yelp, I really wanted to give this place a 3 star. Problem is, I am a fan, and I&apos;m a fan of a lot of sub-stellar places.

First off, it&apos;s expensive for what it is. A ginormous bowl of porridge that looks a lot more than there actually is, two little dishes of your choice for almost $9. That is a lot of money for a small fistful of pre-made food.

On the positive side, I can&apos;t live without this place. You come home from work and you feel like crap. You lay on your bed letting it soak up your sorrow, then your hunger strikes like Midwestern tornado. You hop into your pos car, precisely 1 minute 23 seconds later you are at the door of the Porridge Place. Alas, the food is hot and ready and you start shoving it down your throat immediately.

The seats are uncomfortable, and the staff couldn&apos;t care less about your complicated existence, further improving your eating efficiency.

How can you resist?

Actually, contrary to what people said, I felt that this place was quite quiet..and um.. peaceful, if you ask me. But that could be because I have a cold right now and my ears are a little plugged up.

They have good deals.. You choose 3 sides for $5 and they serve you porridge with yam to come with it.  And they serve it right to your table too.  The food may not look that appetizing, but it is very delicious.

My friend ordered chicken drumsticks, ox tail? and some kind of fish...it looked pretty stiff but it&apos;s actually quite tender inside.
I ordered green beans, tofu strips, and bamboo shoots.  Really good.. all of them, actually.

I recommend coming here, it&apos;s a good place to eat for lunch and/or for a quick bite.  And you won&apos;t feel like a loner if you come by yourself either (that&apos;s the atmosphere I got, at least) =D

The tab for 2 plus tax and tip was under 12 dollars-- very cheap.  And I&apos;m a cheap person.. I didn&apos;t even pay though haha.

And apparently people say Taiwanese people will like this food because the cooking is very much like what they usually eat, and that Cantonese people won&apos;t like it so much... well.. I came with a Cantonese guy and he seemed to like it.
He eats a lot.. he ate all my food, all his food, and the whole batch of porridge.  He&apos;s either extremely hungry or REALLY likes the food.
I have no idea where he puts it all... I wish I was a guy..

After several days of stuffing myself to the max, I literally needed a break from the routine.

The idea of porridge sounded appealing.  Warm and soothing, it&apos;s often the perfect antidote when feeling ill or suffering from eating a little too much.

The porridge served here is Taiwanese-style and more of a &quot;rice boiled with water&quot; than an actual porridge.  There are yams in the porridge, but otherwise no seasoning or other ingredients.

You choose three sides for $6.50 to accompany your meal and there is quite a variety of items.  I ended up choosing the pork meatballs, string beans, and ground pork.

Each side was fairly tasty and, with the plain porridge, a nice combination.  A few sides were a tad oily, but overall, not too bad.

My personal preference for porridge is the thicker Cantonese-style with simple ingredients like sliced fish, pork blood, or minced beef.  But given there isn&apos;t a solid Cantonese option in Cupertino Village, Porridge Place did a fine job substituting and giving my stomach a well deserved break.

Porridge Place is cash only.

Porridge just ain&apos;t my thing. Thought I&apos;d try this place for something different - it&apos;s was a cozy place but pretty packed so that was a good sign. You go up to the counter and pick a number of more authentic type Taiwanese-style Chinese small plates (each about $3-5 I think ) and then sit down at a table where they bring you the items you close along with a big pot of piping hot plain porridge.  And you eat your porridge with those items - simple as that. They charged $1 per person for the porridge.

Unfortunately I didn&apos;t leave satisfied. The hot plain porridge was rather soothing in the cold evening but the dishes we chose (some sliced tofu dish, some veggie dish, and some bean thing) were just not that tasty and more on the oily side. For $13-14 we did get a nice decent amount of food and a pot of porridge more than any 2 ppl can eat (I hope they don&apos;t recycle the porridge for another table!)

Bottom line:  If you&apos;re in the mood for porridge, this place could be for you. The porridge felt good but it just didn&apos;t hit the spot for me as the side dishes were only avg and rather oily.

I&apos;ve been to Porridge Place a few times and it&apos;s a pretty good deal if you&apos;re looking for cheap eats. I don&apos;t like their porridge at all, the consistency of it is way too soupy and not very sticky, and I don&apos;t like yams.

The way it&apos;s prepared is a regional thing to China/Taiwan so that might be why. I like their side dishes a lot, and I usually come for that and I&apos;ll choke down some rice with it to fill up. I think it&apos;s just my personal preference as I grew up to porridge as a comfort food and it&apos;s prepared very differently here. Also I stopped by last time in the middle of the afternoon and the items on their steam table were very unappealing at that time. But still, can&apos;t beat all that food for such a low price!

Best place to go when you are sick, either phisically sick or homesick. Everyone agrees.

I don&apos;t see why people are complaining about the price. I thought it&apos;s quite reasonable. We got a huge thing of porridge, cabbage, lion heads(juicy tender meatball), and mapo tofu. Simple, tasty, like my mom makes at home. Not too greasy, not too salty, maybe without MSG (at least i didn&apos;t feel it afterwards).Exactly what we needed when my boy and I both had stomach flu.

We asked for taking away the left over porridge, they charged up $1.00. No big deal, it&apos;s cheap, but feels kinda weird. You get charged by taking away your leftover that they are going to dump anyways? But it turned out that they gave us a huge new container of porridge. It&apos;s so much that it&apos;ll probably last for 1-2 weeks.

No visit to the Bay Area is complete without lunch at Porridge Place. I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. It&apos;s nothing flashy but it&apos;s Taiwanese comfort food at it&apos;s best. I prefer going at lunch instead of dinner because the lunch deal makes it more worth it: $6.50 for all-you-can-eat porridge + 3 side dish choices. The portions are huge for lunch, enough to take leftovers home. The only thing that dinner has on lunch at Porridge Place is the century egg and tofu dish which is one of their best dishes. They don&apos;t offer it as a part of the lunch deal, but you can order it as another side dish.

Usually there&apos;s a wait during the peak lunch hours. When your table is ready, just go straight up to the buffet section in the back and pick out your 3 side dish choices from the 20+ they have pre-made. Don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t speak Chinese or don&apos;t know what it&apos;s called; pointing is sufficient. They&apos;ll bring those and the pot of porridge to your table, along with tea or water. I always take forever to decide because all the dishes look so tasty, but somehow I always seem to end up with at least two of these three: the spicy marinated tripe, the bamboo shoots, and the sliced stomach with pickled vegetables. If you go with more people, you can get different choices and share.

The rice porridge at Porridge Place isn&apos;t quite like how mom makes it at home because they add yam to it. I don&apos;t particularly like the yam so I avoid the big pieces and go for the smaller bits, but if you like yam then you&apos;ll love this porridge. The consistency of the porridge is perfect, not too thick and not too watery. Free refills of the porridge too!

Chinese comfort food at its best. You can get a bowl of Taiwanese rice/yam porridge with three toppings for $5. Not the widest selection of toppings in the world, but what they do have on offer is excellent. My favorites are the chickens feet, Chinese sausage, and preserved eggs.

I have flashbacks to my halcyon days in Taipei every time I set foot in here.

Minus one star because they&apos;re cash-only.

We came today coz my +1 wasn&apos;t feeling too well.  :(   I thought having hot porridge would be an excellent idea. It&apos;s my first time here and we were both very satisfied with the food. There are many dishes to select from and they gave us a huge pot of porridge that comes with sweet potato too.

It&apos;s a small place but the service is good and prompt. I would definitely come back here again when I feel like having a light lunch. The lunch price is very reasonable. You can select 3 dishes and the cost for two person is only $11.

The most important thing though, is that my +1 became visibly better after the porridge..  :)

Very unique concept well for me at least.  Porridge served by the bucket (literally a plastic tub that might be an Igloo brand concept but you know it says Made in  China in Chinese underneath).  Porridge is cheap at a buck per person but the sides which include anything from chickens feet, garlic braised eggplant, long narrow bamboo shoots (I&apos;m talking up to 6 inches), Chinese sausage, those dark Chinese style eggs, seafood etc...  Make sure to get the hakusai or chinese cabbage which was seasoned with little brine, that was quite tasty.  Didn&apos;t have the balls to try some of the other sides but I&apos;m sure they are good if you have the stomach to look at it.

We went for dinner but I know that you get way more for your buck at lunch.

This place is great for warm, soupy, yummy in my tummy comfort food.  The porridge is always piping hot and slightly flavored with yams cooked in the rice.  Lining up at the front counter, there are a myriad of choices for sides, and all of them are very affordable.  Today we had the sliced bean curd, chicken, cabbage, tofu, tea eggs, string beans, and xiao long bao.

Good: sliced bean curd, cabbage, xiao long bao, chicken
- All these dishes were very flavorful and well done

Meh: tofu, tea eggs, string beans
- Tofu a little too salty, eggs kind of hard and overdone, string beans a little wilty and soggy

The service is only okay, as tonight they were understaffed.  Ordering the side dishes at the counter took much longer than it should have because there was only one person taking peoples orders, filling the dishes, and delivering them to the table.  There is also very little sitting area, so even at 8:30pm, there was a long wait for a table.

If there was another porridge place in the area, I would love to try it out because my experience at this place has only been okay.  However, for well under $10/person for a full stomach, it&apos;s a great deal, and I will probably keep coming back.

It&apos;s a cute little place with lots of side dishes. A general rule of thumb with those side dishes is that if it looks good, it&apos;s probably good. And if it looks kind of funky, it might still be good. But it might also be pig intestines. Just ask if you&apos;re not too sure. Having some kind of working knowledge of some kind of conversational Chinese would probably help at this point.

It&apos;s a really good deal though. I&apos;ve had better porridge at another place in Milpitas, but considering they&apos;re giving the stuff away for free, I&apos;m not really going to sweat it. It&apos;s still pretty good.

And they&apos;re frickin generous with the side dishes, btw.

I went here at night with a friend. You can eat porridge as much as you want as long as you order side dish(es). We ordered 4 side dishes. The side dishes were good, they were anchovies, green veggies, pork ear, and pork feet. All 3 side dishes were to my liking but the pork feet was just alright. The porridge with yam was new to me and I didn&apos;t really like it. I like my porridge plain or with chicken broth, but not with yam. The porridge was watery, but I think it&apos;s just their style.

Service was below average-average. I think most of chinese restaurants in south bay area  have below average-average service level, except the upscale chinese restaurants (mayflower, abc, etc).

Porridge doesn&apos;t really make you full, so if you are looking for a hearty meal, don&apos;t go here. I bet you&apos;ll be hungry again in no time.

Been coming here since high school and I&apos;m still a fan. My mom and I always order from the &quot;fast food&quot; section instead of ordering food from the kitchen. They have a lunch deal on weekdays which is more than enough for one person. For almost $7.00 you choose 3 items from the lineup, take a seat and chow down. They bring the porridge with huge yam chunks, warm tea and the plate of food to your table. You pay at the front when you&apos;re done.

It&apos;s a no frills place and very homie which I love. Great if you have time for lunch but not tons of time- know what I mean? Don&apos;t want fast food but you don&apos;t want sit down and wait until the kitchen is done preparing your food too.

Great on a cold day since the porridge will warm you and it&apos;s also great on hot days since they have cold dishes like bitter melon, pickled cucumber, squid and others. I want this now and I just ate lunch!

Parking is troublesome since it&apos;s in Cupertino Village but it&apos;s manageable.

After five days straight of gorging ourselves around the bay, my family decided we wanted something lighter for dinner. Of course, I managed to just about roll out of here because I apparently have no gauge of fullness when it comes to Chinese food. But it was good times.

This ain&apos;t your Canto jook (zhou) place. This restaurants dishes up your comfort Taiwanese-style rice porridge (xi fan). Seriously, it&apos;s like chicken soup for the soul. If you as so much cough, expect your mom to whip up some xi fan for you to eat morning, noon, and night. At Porridge Place, the porridge is served steaming hot with chunks of yam in what looks like mini-coolers--so definitely no-frills.

As people mentioned, they have quite the lunch deal - 3 dishes for $5.99 inc. porridge. Dinner they charge $1 per person for a bowl. Finding that out got my super thrifty Asian sister licking the cooler clean. And asking for a refill.

But this place totally hit home. Comfort food all the way. Just mosey on over the counter, start pointing and nodding, and then they&apos;ll serve the dishes up to your table. Throw the food on top of a bowl of xi fan and you&apos;re good to go.

Everything was tasty. Seriously, things were marinated just right, and the flavors worked perfectly. Ordered up some tofu gan (dried tofu strips), braised cabbage, eggplant in garlic sauce, egg pancake with dried turnips, marinated cucumbers, and oysters in black bean sauce (my favorite!).

My inner fob was thrilled.

Cheap, fast, and tasty.  Service is lacking, but so what?  You&apos;re not going to a Michelin rated restaurant.  I wouldn&apos;t trust a homestyle hole-in-the-wall restaurant if it DIDN&apos;T have horrible service and questionable sanitation.  That is the charm of the place.  Just like I&apos;d never trust a clean Taqueria, well mannered Chinese restaurants are just as dubious.

I also don&apos;t mind the yam in the porridge.  It&apos;s not the way my mommy made it either, but you are reading this review on yelp because you are the type to try new things right?

Went on the recommendation of a friend of a friend. There were four of us, none Taiwanese, so we were kind of out of our element. Frankly, we had no idea what most of the foods on the tray were, and some of them looked kind of odd to my untrained eye. Atmosphere was fine -- casual, friendly. Our service wasn&apos;t bad, as some of the other reviews suggest. My medium-low rating is really based on the fact that I thought the porridge was bland, bland, bland and I didn&apos;t like the tofu at all.

Big pluses were a tasty cucumber dish (whatever the dressing/seasonings were were fabulous), an equally tasty green bean dish, and yummy bok choy.

I wouldn&apos;t suggest non-Taiwanese people go without a friend who knows the ropes (and the food).

I wasn&apos;t expecting this place to be as tasty and cheap as it was...my boyfriend and I were desperate for a late night dinner place last night, and as luck would have it, this place was open til 11 pm. We wandered in as they were cleaning the tables (they scrub them with a lot of soap, so you know your table is clean!). It was about 10 pm, and there was an older couple in there eating, and a few people wandered in and out for takeout, but otherwise the place was pretty much almost closed. I asked if we could still eat there and they said yes, of course, and got us a table right away.

We went to the front counter to order...mind you, everything on the menu on the board is in Chinese, so unless you don&apos;t read Chinese and can&apos;t identify the dishes, you may be a little out of luck. My boyfriend and I ordered the black preserved egg with tofu, a dish of green veggies (kind of like all green bok choy), chicken gizzards, a sweetish/salty pinkish sausage, and tea eggs with tofu. The hot soupy porridge cooked with yams was delicious and reminded me of the porridge my family used to cook at home. The yams were a nice touch, I love yams!! All the sides we ordered were also reminiscent of home, not overly salty (cept for the sauce on the tofu with preserved egg).

The service was friendly and smiled a lot. Inspite of ordering all that, it was only $20 at the end. Mmm! A good place for a late night treat.

My friends and I came here for an afternoon snack during a hectic day...

The porridge was rather interesting to me since it was cooked with yams, so it was kinda sweet...I am more use to the plain porridge.

I liked the sides that we ordered.  We had cooked pork, Shrimp, pickled radish, pickled celery...yummy...all of which was not salty at all...

All in all, we felt that the amount of food was sufficient for an afternoon snack.  It did not ruin our appetite for dinner and the food was very tasty.

I came here right before my flight back to school.

Very few dishes compared to the one in new milpitas. No, correction, very feww &quot; dishes that josie likes&quot;. I was disappointed, and it was pricey!

I was sad that this had to be my last  NORCAL meal before i left for school. sigh., should have gone to tofu house

It was late at night after shopping (around 9:30pm),
my friend and I realized that we are so hungry...but
we knew it would be hard to find restaurant after 9:00pm.

No fast food!! but we are hungry, so we ended up with
Cupertino Village because Chines/Taiwanesese
restaurants are usually open late.

We tried 4 items,
Green bean, Smoke tofu, bamboo shoot&amp;bitter melon
everything was very tasty and soooooo healthy!
Every item go well with the porridge with yam.

I would love to try their lunch (M-T) $5.99 with 3 items!

I refrain from giving 5 stars simply because I could make this at home...but this is a great place to go if you&apos;re lacking ingredients and/or time! Great for a cold day, or maybe if you&apos;re not feeling too well (just be careful to pick the healthier side dishes and not the oily ones!).

My friend and I had a huge pot of porridge with 4 side dishes, and we were stuffed. I ended up taking two box-fuls home and it could&apos;ve fed two people for another meal, but I was greedy and ate it all myself (and kinda regretted it afterwards).

The spicy tofu (like mapo tofu) is really good, and the tofu with the duck egg (pi dan)...mmm. The ground pork dish was good too.

Came out to be about $20, and I added another $3 for tip...that&apos;s a pretty good deal for a meal that could&apos;ve fed 4 people! [Cash only!]

Tip: It would help if you came here with someone who spoke mandarin. If you look Chinese they will automatically speak to you in mandarin. But either way, I think they&apos;ll still treat you the same (remember, don&apos;t base your review on service when reviewing a Chinese restaurant!).

If you want something cheap, fast and tasty for a weak stomach, this is a good option in Cupertino village.  For lunch, you can order 3 items to go with a pot of porridge cooked with bits of yam.  I recommend the minced pork, bamboo shoots, and meatballs.  The squid is a bit tough and chewy.

Service is fast, friendly and helpful.  The ambiance and decor is simple and clean for a fast food joint.  Parking is ample in the lot.
