Brief History of Vending Machines
 Posted on August 11, 2010 by School Vending 
There are numerous different types of vending machines or automatic retailing as it’s also known as.

There are snack, soda, gumball, toys, coffee/tea, candy, and hot soup vending machines that are located just about every where we look.

Vending machines came about in 251BC when a Greek mathematician invented a vending machine that could vend Holy water in the Egyptian temples.

A lot of years following that the very first coin-operated vending machines were invented that dispensed post cards in the early 1880′s in London, England. Years later, Richard Carlisle, an English professor invented a vending machine that could dispense books.

Vending machines have come a long way since then. In 1888, Thomas Adams Gum Business unveiled the vending machine to the U.S. and it sold Tutti-Fruiti gum.

Later on 1907, the very first round candy coated gumball that all kids love was unveiled.

As the years went on there was a vending machine for just about everything; cigars, stamps, postcards, cigarettes, soda, even snack foods. We still use a few of these vending machines today.

In the early 1920′s, the vending machines began to offer soda in cups for the very first time. That’s where the hot coffee/tea/cocoa vending machines originated as well.

We still use the soda vending machines that allow us to place our soda into cups. You are able to find them in any self serve convenience store or fast food restaurant.

Some famous vending machines are the Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola vending machines. We still use them today, but not in cups, they come in bottle or cans. Snack vending machines are very popular as well these days especially in hospitals, colleges, bus stations and airports.

We like convenience, choices, and low prices. Vending machines offer all these and they’ve been offering it for hundreds of years; meaning vending machines should be doing something right.
