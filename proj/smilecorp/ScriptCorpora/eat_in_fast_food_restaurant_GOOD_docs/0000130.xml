The Project

 
 The Project 

 The 
purpose of this paper is to provide an action plan for developing a chain of restaurants to market and sell foods 
commonly found in UAE throughout the world. This paper will be divided into 
several sections. Section one defines the key elements of an action plan 
required for gathering information. The discussion of the target market segments 
and marketing strategy will be included. Section Two, the marketing part of the 
paper discusses ideas concerning innovation and procedures of the establishment of a chain of international restaurants . And finally, Section Three discusses the 
Monitoring Techniques to be used (i.e. Progress Reports, Timeline, and Outcome 
Measurements). 

 Section 1. Key Elements 

 Target Market Segments 

 The main target market for the chain of restaurants is people around the globe who wanted to experience UAE foods . The secondary target market will be the locals and tourists in 
UAE and business stakeholders , who have sustained the growth of the restaurant 
industry through their continued patronage . Specifically, the demographic profile of the market of this 
chain of restaurants will be the all-aged generation of customers, from the 1 to 
any age bracket. The food and beverage has been served in various ways thus 
making the market rather varied as well. It is also proposed that the target 
market on this context would also include the younger generations . A need to cater to a specific demographic has spawned 
the need to acquire a competitive advantage with the rest of the players in the market. 

 Marketing Strategy 

 As for 
the marketing strategy of the chain of restaurants, 
the marketing mix is comprised of these following approaches to pricing, 
distribution, advertising and promotion, and customer service ( Farrall&amp;Lindsley, 2008) . 

 Pricing. The chain of restaurant&apos;s pricing scheme is that the product cost is 45% of the 
 total retail price. Distribution. The chain of restaurant&apos;s food will be distributed through a 
 takeout model where customers can call in their order and come to 
 the restaurant to pick it up, come into the restaurant, place the take 
 out order and wait for it to be completed, or come in and dine at the 
 restaurant. Advertising and Promotion. The most 
 successful advertising will be banner ads, and inserts in newspaper and 
 magazines. Customer Service. Obsessive customer 
 attention is the mantra.  The chain of 
 restaurant&apos;s philosophy is that whatever needs to be done to make the 
 customer happy must occur, even at the expense of short-term profits. In 
 the long term, this investment will pay off with a fiercely loyal customer 
 base who is extremely vocal to their friends with referrals. 

 Section 2. Innovation 
and Establishment Procedures 

 Innovation Strategy 

                The products that the chain of restaurants will offer are excellent food items and will increase in 
number as time passes. With this, it is vital to consider innovation practices. The chain of restaurants will innovate the food’s 
presentation and its marketing strategy. The names of the food are unique, so 
that customers may know that the products are uniquely from this chain of 
restaurants . Before the food were formally included in the 
official list of the business’ offerings, there were taste tests conducted in 
local supermarkets, and those that passed initial testing were given official 
names to establish identification. The bowls and plates were likewise pre-tested 
for their functionality and durability to withstand water heat. The tissues and 
utensil which would be used are manufacturer-guaranteed to be 
environment-friendly and safe for human use. The machines and equipment to be 
used are likewise tested in order to bring only the best-tasting food and 
beverages that is worth every amount of money they spent. The price will depend 
on the type of food. The prices would be in par with those existing restaurants 
in UAE, with the business relying on the restaurant ambience, quality of dining 
service, and free live band performance to gain competitive advantage from 
rivals in the area. Using all the available information in this business plan, 
the pricing objective would be to offer the best-tasting UAE-type foods at 
relatively affordable price ranges. With that in mind, the pricing strategy 
included the cost of providing foods to the customer (electricity costs, labour 
costs, raw materials cost, etc.) 

 From these innovation strategies, this chain of 
restaurants will have an image of products that are unique 
and defensible attributes which could support a high price. However, since a 
sector of the target market involves young people, who commonly do not have a 
source of income of their own, this chain of restaurants will strive to keep costs at the lowest level in order to maintain a cheap price 
offering for all their food products. Also, since it aims to promote an image of 
affordability and quality all rolled into one, this pricing strategy would 
definitely help build and sustain that target image. 

 Establishment Procedures 

                On start-up, there will only be one restaurant located in some 
cities of UAE where clients could go to have their satisfying foods. This is the 
main and only channel of distribution for the initial months of the business. 
However, if financial statements forecasts prove true, customers will soon see a 
number of Restaurant bistros lined up in the thoroughfares of cities of foreign 
countries. 

 The main promotion and advertising objective of the business 
is to be able to spread this chain of restaurants word 
without allotting too much on marketing costs. After all, what works well and 
what does not work at will depend mostly on the business, the product and 
service accompanying it, the community, the competition and the skills in how 
the marketing director will promote the business. As soon as possible, the new 
restaurant sign will be put up (including the name, type of shop, hours of 
operation and the opening date) in order to promote the business well before its 
opening. When the employment ads are posted in the local papers, the business 
will make sure to include Thunderstorm Restaurant’ name and location, as this 
inexpensive classified advertising will help promote the business. 

 There will be a card awarded free to the first fifty 
customers of this chain of restaurants on the day that 
it opens. This card will serve as their Restaurant Advantage Card and will avail 
them of all the benefits of being a Restaurant Advantage Card holder. Discounts 
and freebies will be given on designated periods to all cardholders. However, 
those who were not able to avail of the card for free could still own one given 
a minimum amount membership fee ($ 100). The advertising part of marketing will 
consist only of a free taste booth in front of the restaurant during the first 
week, half dozen streamers around the area and a hundred flyers to be given away 
at supermarket doors. Also, one hundred business cards will be at hand, as they 
are a great way of advertising. The management believes that this is sufficient 
to advertise the business, and the rest will be left to word-of-mouth. 

 Section 3. Monitoring 
Techniques 

 Progress Reports 

 With regards to the progress of the chain of restaurants, a 
progress meeting will be held every week to monitor progress and guide the 
business to a successful completion. Progress meetings provide an effective 
forum for the managers to coordinate, integrate and manage the business 
stakeholders. Meetings provide a dynamic environment where interaction and 
innovation will enhance the cross flow of ideas and help solve problems. The 
meetings should also provide the venue for consensus and decision making. A 
progress meeting for this business venture would contain the following: 

 
 Agenda: The agenda should 
 be circulated before the meeting to list the participants and action points 
 to prepare for the meeting. 

 
 Minutes: Approve minutes of 
 previous meeting. 
 Actions: Report on actions 
 from previous meeting. 
 Progress: Report progress 
 by work package. 
 Configuration management: Discuss scope changes and concessions-their implications and approval. 
 Document Control: List 
 controlled documents transmitted and police signing transmittals. 
 Claims: Discuss any claims 
 since the last meeting. 
 Quality: Discuss quality 
 issues. 
 Payments: Approve invoices 
 for payment. 

   

 The minutes should be produced as soon as possible after the 
meeting preferably the next day, The minutes should document discussions and 
agreements taken during the meeting, together with actions to be done before the 
next meeting.

 Outcome Measurement 

 With regards to the outcome measurement, this chain of 
restaurants should do some evaluation regarding the 
completion of the whole project. The auditor should consider the implications of 
non-compliance in relation to other aspects of the audit, particularly the 
reliability of management representations ( Mohd-Sanusi, 
Iskandar&amp;Saleh, 2009 ). In this regard, the auditor 
reconsiders the risk assessment and the validity of management representations, 
in case of non-compliance not detected by the entity’s internal controls or not 
included in management representations. The implications of particular instances 
of non-compliance discovered by the auditor will depend on the relationship of 
the perpetration and concealment, if any, of the act to specific control 
activities and the level of management or employees involved (Arter, 2002). The 
auditor should, as soon as practicable, either communicate with those charged 
with governance, or obtain audit evidence that they are appropriately informed, 
regarding non-compliance that comes to the auditor’s attention. However, the 
auditor need not do so for matters that are clearly inconsequential or trivial 
and may reach agreement in advance on the nature of such matters to be 
communicated. If in the auditor’s judgment the non-compliance is believed to be 
intentional and material, the auditor should communicate the finding without 
delay. The auditor may conclude that withdrawal from the engagement is necessary 
when the entity does not take the remedial action that the auditor considers 
necessary in the circumstances, even when the non-compliance is not to the 
financial statements. 

   

 Final Statement 

 Based on the previous details, planning is a key resource of 
the organization, together with people, finances and material assets. Thus, it 
is accepted to state that project plan is a business issue. The discussion above 
revealed that through effective project planning management of the 
organisation’s resources and systems, organization administrators can add value 
to the services delivered to customers, reduce risks in the organisation’s 
business, reduce the costs of business development and service delivery and 
encourage improvement in internal business processes and external service 
implementation. On the other hand, it is recommended that when developing a 
project, it is better to build a report that is ideal for a specific need then 
to make a report based on a predefined concession.
