Mattel Disney Pixar Cars 2 Diecast: Jeff Gorvette Metallic Toys R US Exclusive
 
The“metallic”Jeff Gorvette has arrived–TRU exclusive…

 

Unlike in Europe where’s it’s a“free”CAR with minimum purchase during the promo period, here in the US, you can buy it now for $6.99.

 

And probably during the Labor Day sale period, they will again offer it again free with $25 CARS 2 purchases…

 

Side by side with the regular release.

Going to collect the metallics and rubber tires to leave in the package. My son’s open WGP cars are taking quite a beating. Can’t see paying 7 bucks for a car with a nice paint finish that will be destroyed in a month.

I wonder if they will get here to Utah

Looks pretty nice but I am not a fan of this metallic finish on the same cars thing, especially at twice the price. I would much rather prefer a more of a variation like we were use to seeing.

Its a pretty gold paint. the way it was applied, it IS overpriced.
some have dirt in the paint, overspray on the tampos, touch up paint applied. Like they were saving on the paint, so its a thin thin coat.

You can see the base coat color on some of them.

Met, they are offering it online (at the moment sold out), also to buy for €6,99. We do not have to spend the €25,- to get it for free anymore

May pass. I’m excited for the Emerald Nigel Gearsley!

almost twice the price for the paint is a little much. it is nice.

Yeah I surprised to find these yesterday at TRU so I picked up a few. I do like that paint job.

The TRU’s here got the Gold Gorvettes last week–one case of 6 per store.

Wow! That’s a nice paint job. I liked him already but looking great now.
 Log in to Reply Dinocoblue says: August 5, 2011 at 6:57 am 
Wow, I really like this toy. It looks really good. I can’t wait to see Nigel!
