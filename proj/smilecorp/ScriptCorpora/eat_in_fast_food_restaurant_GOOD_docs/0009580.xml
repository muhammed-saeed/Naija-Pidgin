 Displaying 1 - 6 of 6 Reviews Found Sort: Useful | Helpful | Reviews | Date Hocky puck burgers By cocoeater of vancouver (295 Reviews) Submitted Wednesday, August 5, 2009 - 1:41pm [Dine in] 
Went here for a bite after shopping and this location choices seem a bit limited. Get the normal pizza, hotdog, chicken fingers and burger. So tried the Angus Burger with fries and drink. At $5.99, a good deal. Looked impressive with a big paddy but the cheese was not melted, which is a bad sign. Tasted like the paddy was one of these pre-cooked with grill mark types. Just been nuked. One good thing is that you can put your own condiments. However the burger was really hard and dry. Didn&apos;t like it at all and would avoid it at all cost. Fries were OK but couldn&apos;t finish them. Fast service and outdoor picnic like settiing.

 Typical Costco....excellent By itadakimasu of Vancouver (64 Reviews) Submitted Friday, July 2, 2010 - 2:26pm [Dine in] 
I&apos;ve eaten here 3 times now and always the same....it&apos;s Great! I&apos;ve always ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich at $5 and have to say it&apos;s better than the Montreal Smoked Beef shop down the street from me. The meat is warm and tender and the bun are those triangular ones they sell at Costco. It comes with a huge pickle (also available foe sale in bulk) and unlimited sauerkraut and peppers from the condiments station. We&apos;ve also had the hotdog, chicken nuggets and fries and they were all fresh and good too. The ambiance is... well......it&apos;s Costco so don&apos;t try to impress your date.

 Bring back the ribs By hydeeho of Burnaby (166 Reviews) Submitted Wednesday, August 5, 2009 - 2:01pm [Dine in] 
Went to Costco craving the barbeque ribs with fries. I have previously had them about 3 times before. This is a take home item because the eating area is kind of grungy and not conducive to a pleasant meal. Always tasty and large portions. Unbelieveable but the best item on the menu is discontinued and replaced by the angus burger. Sometimes life makes no sense. Bring back the ribs.

 bulk By chasiubow of North Van (675 Reviews) Submitted Tuesday, February 10, 2009 - 11:03am [Dine in] 
Costco has super sizes of everything. In fact on a recent visit Mrs. C kept taking items out of our cart and saying things like&quot;Chasiu, it&apos;s too big!&quot;. I do often fantasize about taking home a 30 pack of Famous Amos, but I digress.

The fast food area is near the entrance, and there are hard plastic benches and tables with large umbrellas on top, all in a garish red and white motif. These are the Costco colors. Every surface has crumbs or sauce on it and no one seems to take a particular interest in cleanliness. Service is usually okay, but it can range from overly friendly to indifferent, depending on who is at the counter. If you are eating in a warehouse you shouldn&apos;t have high expectations.

The snack bar at Costco only has gigantor sizes. The 2 dollar hotdog is as long as a child&apos;s arm and comes with a vat of pop that will fill up even the biggest shoppers. Other items include poutine, pizza, ribs, ice cream, and other assorted delights. On our last visit Mrs. C ordered chicken fingers and I had ribs, both accompanied by about a pound of fries. We shared a drink, since it was big enough for two thirsty adults. The ribs were a lot better than the ones they sell in the store, and I asked the clerk if they have them in the frozen food section, but she didn&apos;t know. The chicken fingers were unremarkable. The fries were quite good, but WAY too much to finish in one sitting. As for value it was crazy cheap, but I guess they get a good wholesale price and pass the savings on. That&apos;s the Costco way.

Good if you want to build up a respectable jelly belly.

 Anson Burger = No, Ribs = Yes! By InuKing88 of Burnaby, BC (24 Reviews) Submitted Tuesday, December 29, 2009 - 10:35pm [Dine in] 
Everytime we go shopping at Costco here on Still Creek Drive we stop at this snack bar to eat. I used to always order the fries&amp;chicken wings plus the fries&amp;ribs, but much has changed when they got rid of the ribs for the Anson Burger.
I tried the Anson Burger, wasn&apos;t a big fan of it. All I can say is the ribs were better than that. We order the fries&amp;chicken wings and the Montreal Sandwich or pizza now. The pizza&apos;s pretty big.
Service is okay, I don&apos;t really know since I&apos;ve only been here once and most of the time my dad does all the shopping.
Prices are reasonable. Just like I don&apos;t really know the service, I don&apos;t really know the prices either.
What do you expect with ambiance, this is a booth. The place is pretty clean though.

Am I coming back? We shop a lot at Costco, so yes.

 Costco! My savior! By frenchie75 of White Rock (34 Reviews) Submitted Tuesday, February 10, 2009 - 11:42am [Dine in] 
Chasiubow, you always crack me up! I love your reviews! In fact I think you may have quite a fan following with DH readers.
I have to admit that the Richmond Costco was a savior to us when we were commuting from UBC back to White Rock in my university days. We&apos;d stop there and wait out tunnel traffic while shopping and eating gigantic hot dogs and fries..... back when calories weren&apos;t such a big deal.
The Burnaby also was a beacon for us on our way back home from skiing at Whistler or the local mtns. for the day. The hot dogs are so good, but because of the size.... well, sometimes regret follows soon after...... good thing there is lots of pop (refillable) to help wash it all down. I haven&apos;t eaten much of the other food there except the occasional stir-fry (at the Richmond location.....at least it used to be) and the pizza (which is decent for the size and price..... don&apos;t expect too much in the way of toppings). The hot dogs are top quality though and are Kosher I believe. But they also offer poutine, baked chicken in pastry, ribs.....and ice cream.
Now as I&apos;m older I do wish that they had a couple of healthier choices since it&apos;s so convenient to eat here after a marathon shopping trip and to fortify ourselves before hauling all the stuff we never knew we needed home..... several hundreds dollars later.
Service is fast and that&apos;s all that matters to me since by the time I make it to the food court area I really just want to eat quickly and get going home.
Ambiance.....well Chasiubow described it to a T.
Value....come on.....it&apos;s Costco!
P.S. Never delude yourself that you are only going to come out of Costco with just the bathroom toilet paper you stopped there for.
