 Microsoft 
Microsoft Corporation is a public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system (OS) market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of OSs. The ensuing rise of stock in the company&apos;s 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. Microsoft would come to dominate other markets as well, notably the office suite market with Microsoft Office.

 Openbravo Mobile Web / Multi-Touch Preview (Web POS example) 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 11:32 Published: 14 Apr 2012 Updated: 23 Jun 2012 
Author: openbravo See for yourself the kind of state-of-the art mobile user experiences coming out of Openbravo&apos;s global open source labs. Our user-centric experiences are not only productive and leverage the latest multi-touch mobile hardware options, they are also a joy to execute. Your Barcelona-based hosts are Openbravo User Experience Guru Rob Goris and Retail specialist Elena Martinez, who will use a prototype to demonstrate some of the use cases we are developing. The focus of this particular prototype is our Web POS (Point of Sale) client, which is one very exciting new addition to the Openbravo for Retail solution. This video will give you a feel for the kind of integrated, mobile web experiences you can expect from Openbravo. Specifically note these points about our mobile web vision: - this user experience is representative of the forthcoming Web POS functionality, and - it clearly demonstrates the kind of mobile web UIs that will be generated using Openbravo&apos;s device-neutral, model-driven technology, and - it shows the power of a centralized, real time database that serves both retail back office and store-level needs--easily accessed by great web UIs from a choice of traditional PCs / POS terminals or mobile devices Note that this is a prototype / concept video, and hence does not precisely represent the initial Web POS product version. As a development philosophy, we&quot;start with the end in mind&quot;from the (Market + UX) vision perspective, and then use our agile development&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; http://wn.com/Openbravo_Mobile_Web_Multi-Touch_Preview_Web_POS_example

 Mobile Payment SquareUp: SalesVu Beats Square at Brian&apos;s Brew 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 3:54 Published: 24 Aug 2011 Updated: 10 Jun 2012 
Author: KapMooProductions Hey this is Brian from Brian&apos;s Brew. I recently switch from Square to SalesVu. SalesVu is the best point of sale and mobile payment solution I&apos;ve ever seen. SalesVu&apos;s card reader is more stable and more secure than Squares. Their rates are better. With Square, if I enter the card manually, because of an account that I have on file or a scratched card, they want to charge 3.5%. With SalesVu, it&apos;s still 2.7% for manually entered cards. With Square if I do more than a $1000 I have to wait 30 days for the funds to post. With SalesVu, it doesn&apos;t matter how much I do, it&apos;s still the next day. I love this SalesVu app because it just blows Square out of the water. It is the best point of sale. Square is very basic. You put items on there, once you get over 20 items you have trouble finding everything, but with this SalesVu app, you can look at it through category, you can look at it alphabetically, you can program the list where, the top of list is what you&apos;re selling the most. You can find anything in seconds. It&apos;s very user friendly. I love how I can just program modifiers in, if someone wants to make a latte a soy latte I can have that charge as a modifier. You can&apos;t do that with Square. There&apos;s a great part of the app that connects with facebook. It&apos;s fantastic for viral marketing. There&apos;s a discount button on the app that&apos;s not on Square. You can program it to be what ever kind of discount you want. That&apos;s not anything close to what Square offers. The great thing about&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; http://wn.com/Mobile_Payment_SquareUp_SalesVu_Beats_Square_at_Brian&apos;s_Brew
