Brownsville, TX 78520

 Case #11-081650 

A 49-year-old woman reported in early July that someone had used her debit card without her consent.

She found this out when she checked her bank statements and noticed the unauthorized charges.

Investigators were able to track and identify the suspect through surveillance video from one of the businesses where the debit card had been used.

Tina Sue Aguilar (26) of Brownsville was identified as the suspect and investigators obtained four warrants for her arrest.

Aguilar cooperated with investigators and stated that she had used the debit card at three different convenience stores to fuel up three different vehicles and a fourth time used it at a fast food restaurant.

Tina Sue Aguilar was arraigned this morning on four counts of Credit Card Abuse and total bond was set at $20K.
