Last week, TV chef Paula Deen announced that she’s been suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past three years. She acknowledged that a person has“to make changes in your life”but apparently, Deen hasn’t apparently changed all that much.  TMZ  posted a photo of Deen woolfing down a cheeseburger on Monday while on a 7-day Caribbean cruise. The 65-year-old chef was hosting her annual Party at Sea vacation for 400 fans. TMZ says Deen also had fries on her plate.

Just because you have diabetes doesn’t mean you have to stop eating all together. There is no law against a cheeseburger. Now a triple chocolate hot fudge sundae, that’s a different story.

I am shocked it did not have 3 dounuts on top of the burger!

Paula Deen hid 2 big Facts
1. She knew she had diabetes and hid this fact from the public to keep the money rolling in
2. Her $500 dollar a month drug was beaten by a $20 dollar specialized diabetes diet in a study.
just google SPIRIT HAPPY DIET

You don’t stop eating because you have diabetes. Non-story.

Seriously? I can’t believe this is the news of the day. Leave the woman alone. She has the right to eat what she wants, and the only people that have to give her a hard time is herself and her family. Let’s stick with some real news. Please.

Before reporting nonsense like this, learn about diabetes, you can have a cheeseburger and fries as a diabetic, you can eat anything in moderation and as long as you adjust with your insulin. Why not post the story with her on a treadmill exercising so she could eat that cheeseburger and fries without worry…. DUH, who writes this stuff! NO STORY HERE PEOPLE KEEP IT MOVING!
 
Posted by: Tonya | January 26, 2012, 11:13 am 11:13 am
 
Paula, you should have an order of fries, on the side, just to tick off the media.

Sort of sad that this is what news is being reduced too…

We are on food patrol, counting the calories that Paula Deen eats?!?! Who cares?!?! Maybe it was a veggie burger or a tofu burger….bottom line….she’s gotta eat!!

Another question I have is why is ABC regurgitating news that TMZ posts?!?!
 
Posted by: Lee | January 26, 2012, 11:20 am 11:20 am
 
Oh, goody—she DID have fries. You go, girl…

What I want to know is who in the world took time out of their cruise to report to the media that they saw Paul eating a cheeseburger on that same cruise? Idiots.
 
Posted by: Manda | January 26, 2012, 11:22 am 11:22 am
 
This is crazy! Leave the woman alone! Diabetics must eat too! Who cares if she has a cheeseburger and fries. Would you rather she not eat and starve herself, is that healthier?
 
Posted by: Jennifer | January 26, 2012, 11:26 am 11:26 am
 
I agree that whatever she chooses to eat is her own business, but as a celebrity, she should also be aware that she is being watched, and she has the potential to either positively or negatively influence others. If she wants to eat a burger, fine, but do it in private where you’re not going to be photographed. I think the fact that she has type 2 diabetes after decades of promoting and eating unhealthy foods, and now wants to promote a diabetes drug, is very hypocritical. You would have to be a total MORON not to realize that eating all this bad food all the time leads to an unhealthy life. And after years and years of making poor food choices, I lost over 60 pounds and I feel so much happier. This is a golden opportunity for her to start promoting healthier recipes to a large audience.

Tonya is absolutely right. When you LEARN about Diabeties and how it works with your own body, you CAN indulge every so often and compensate with insulin. Diabetes is a MANAGEABLE disease. Now the press is just making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. Who’s going to throw the first stone??????? Come on, people, prioritize……
 
Posted by: Kathryn | January 26, 2012, 11:28 am 11:28 am
 
Are you stupid? My god lets go shoot the woman for letting anyone see her eat. If you are so critical of a woman who has made her living feeding others and making it a delectable treat, why not stone her in the process. Can’t anyone see that she has lost weight, looks good, and is still making a life in the public eye? Who are you to judge? Have you ever eaten a cheeseburger? Once in a while they are really great! Find something really news worthy to report or shut down your business. I am really tired of this bologna!

NO ONE CARES REALLY!!!! This is the lamest news, so what she ate a cheeseburger OMFG .Im am sure that she can take care of herself.
Report something worth reading for a change.

Oh please.“woolfing”? You don’t eat?

Who cares what she’s eating. I’m diabetic and I also have an occassional burger and fries. It’s not a problem. And so what if she didn’t tell anyone. She gives us recipes, she doesn’t make us eat them. It’s her livelihood, and any averaged joe knows that her cooking isn’t healthy. She’s the first to admit it. So, what would telling everyone that she has diabetes, change? If you didn’t know you could end up with diabetes by eating her food before she told us, then there’s something wrong with you.

Holli:“If she wants to eat a burger, fine, but do it in private where you’re not going to be photographed”….Sorry, Holli. Even celebrities deserve privacy, and not a one of us have the right to judge.

Once again I am reminded why I have stopped watching ABC News. Like many others here, I am also diabetic. One of the first things we learned was there is nothing we can NOT eat–it’s a matter of how much and when. I am not a fan of Paula Deen, but this attack is unacceptable. ABC could have an excellent opportunity here to turn their mistake into a learning tool for the world. The network and writer could learn a lot, then in turn share it where it can do some good. There is no excuse for such ignorance with the wealth of educational information so easily accessible today. BTW – I have lowered my starting A1c blood test of 14.4 to 6.8 as of last checkup. Research THAT! You just added a cheeseburger and fries to my plan for lunch. Other diabetics know what I mean. I look forward to the time when I can say that about you.
 
Posted by: Diane Johnson | January 26, 2012, 11:40 am 11:40 am
 
And people say the media don’t have agendas against certain people. Big deal. She had a cheeseburger. Whats the problem. As long as she moniters her blood sugar levels, she can eat a freaking cheeseburger.

Just watch. Everytime this woman breaths now, the media and stuck up people will act like it’s the end of the world when people living with diabetes have been doing this while monitering their health forever. The media and their agendas are so annoying, the news should be called entrertainment news across the board.

Does TMZ have nothing more to do than follow Paula Deen on her cruise to catch her eating? No surprise here! This is a real low. Drs can not tell you what causes diabetes..children have diabetes..It is an insulin problem. All things in moderation..No matter who you are , What your job choice is..One’s health does not have to be revealed unless one chooses to do so. There is such a thing as privacy in this country and TMZ or any other news organization has no business snooping around and stepping over the line in other peoples private affairs, especially their health issues! Pauls Deen has a lot of fans that LOVE her.It’s never gpooing to change…The food she makes on her shows is not something she ate every day or encouraged anyone to eat like that every day. Common sense goes a long way here and we are all responsible for whatever we choose to put in our mouths.not Paula Deen! Paula gives an array of meal planning ideas but she is in no way responsible for anyone’s choices they make. Good Southern food! If you don’t like her ..Don’t watch her shows..Don’t make her recipes..Go on and eat out in MacDonalds. Burger King, Taco Bell for all of your meals.. Paula will still be around and we will still be watching her shows, Buying her products..enjoying her cruises..Don’t feel put down on..party poopers are not wanted so just stay home!

For god sakes people–leave the woman alone! You’re not her Dr nor her mother. She’s a fantastic Chef and we’ve all loved her for years–who are you to judge? I’m not necessarily defending her per say, but rRead the headline to this story:“Woman caught eating a cheeseburger”–does anyone see how degrading, embarassingly stupid and insignificant this story is? News media outlets have really sunk to new lows. Have we nothing else to talk about in this world but what a woman is eating? People need to get a life to be so enthralled over this reality crap…..

Why doesnt everybody just leave Paula Dean alone. It’s nobody’s business about the way she chooses to handle her health. And she does have to eat doesnt she?

This is ridiculous. You need to do your research on the disease before you call out someone, or repeat a story, for doing nothing wrong. Report someone that matters.

I have type II diabetes. I was diagnosed back in 2005. From my perspective, I am appalled that this is even newsworthy. Are we as a people so very shallow? The only reason that programs like TMZ can post things like this is because we will read them. Paula Deen may be a celebrity, but she is still entitled to her privacy. Not to mention, she is human, is not perfect, and will make mistakes. And I can definitely tell you that seeing her eat a cheeseburger does not encourage me to have bad eating habits. I have a mind and a will of my own. My decisions are my own. If I made all my decisions based on what celebrities do, I’d be completely plastic, filled with botox, divorced 100 times, and a drug addict. Wake up people! Focus on your own life for a change. There are far more important things to worry about than whether Paula ate a cheeseburge and fries on her cruise. How about we put a microscope on everyone? What did you eat last night for dinner? Are you exercising enough? How much do you weigh? Not to mention, you who ridicule her, yes, she is a role model, but so are you to someone else. What are you teaching that person by attacking others and calling names? Better watch out. The next time you eat a cheeseburger, you might cause some poor soul to lead a life of misery and die early of a stroke or a heart attack.

Really…so this is news? This type of story is what journalists go to school for? Hey news agencies, start acting like professionals. What a person eats is their own @#$@% business…not yours, and certainly not the rest of Americas. I literally can’t believe there are news editors who let this crap through. IT IS NOT NEWS!!! IT IS NOT NEWSWORTHY!!! Start reporting real news and quit invading people’s privacy.

Posted by: Kim | January 26, 2012, 12:29 pm 12:29 pm
 
What a display of ignorance by the writer!“Bad”foods are ok in moderation–including when you’re having fun on a cruise and benefiting from stress relief it usually includes. I have type-II diabetes, have gone from 313 to 279 lbs, and guess what? I eat cheeseburgers and french fries. In fact, after riding a mountain bike 10.6 hilly miles on Tuesday and, according to my computerized watch, burning 977 calories, and skipping lunch due to appointments, I had a daily double meal AND a filet of fish sandwich from a fast-food restaurant. I don’t eat like that most days, though I do when I’m on a cruise. But my weight trend is down and according to January blood test, my blood sugar -short and long term- is still better than what the American Diabetes Association says is good. My cholesterol is 144, with HDL at 56 and LDL at 81 and triglycerides at 71. Not many non-cheeseburger eaters can top that!

ok, this is all rediculous. First of all Paula Deen and anyone else for that matter are not teachers who are in charge of our eduction. If she has diabetes that is her business, if someone is overweight, not my problem, too skinny, so what. I do not want to be in charge of everyone elses life, mine is enough to keep up with, thank you. If Mrs. Deen doesn’t eat right or take her medication or monitor her insulin levels, once again, not my business.

This whole society has gone crazy and no one wants to take responsibility for anything. Much easier to blame it on some one else. Its time we all looked after ourselves and a lot of the problems in the good old USA will fix themselves. Work for a living, if you can’t find a job, do what you can to cut back. Plant a garden and can your vegetables for the whole year. Put on a sweater and cut down your thermostate. Cook at home instead of going out. Pull out the sewing machine and make your clothes. Lots of ways to cut back that won’t hurt or demean anyone.

Ok, I’ll get off my soap box. Point is, everyone should be looking after their own“garden”and not be plowing up their neighbors.

Why is everyone making such a big deal. Cooking is her job….not her life. As a diabetic there are times we do not eat exactly right. It is our choice to chose what we eat.

This is crazy–she has diabetes, she isn’t allergic to food! Leave her alone and let her live her life her way. Who cares? She is a wonderful cook, I have made many of her recipes and enjoy her show. I don’t care that she didn’t immediately rush to the media when she was diagnosed with Diabetes, it’s her life and her decision as to when and if to tell anyone.

If Paula uses the Victoza, the medicine that she is advertising for, her sugars are just fine. I would highly recommend people giving a voice to this medecine to the insurance companies so they will make a part of their insured meds.

LOL, I mean I guess there is something else to this story? But look, people are overweight because they either ate too many cheeseburgers–or something like it. Common knowledge.

Can we have more common knowledge stories? I’ll give you some more ideas for free:
“Cheating husband makes wife angry”
“Car accident results in injury”

No, you only get 2 for free, if you want more, you’ll have to pay…later

Really? A cheeseburger, oh no. The bun and the fries aren’t especially good for a diabetic, however, who knows what she ate previously or after. Depending on what happens to you or your blood sugar, some people are“allowed”to have bread/carb at 1 meal. Get over it. It isn’t as though she was sitting there eating a triple chocolate cake dripping with chocolate sauce and topped of with whipped cream.

Wow!!! What a crime!!! What leaves a bad taste in my mouth is seeing all the obese relatively young people in my state (Alabama) waddle or use the motor scooter in the store to buy groceries with their EBT cards and then show up at the doctor’s office where I work with their Medicaid cards getting treated for the high blood pressure, diabetes, knee and back pain on the tax payers dollar with their expensive fake nails, expensive weaves and their designer purses. I doubt the tax payers will have to hand over money to Paula if she does eat a cheeseburger.

Seriously? She’s 65. Leave her alone. The facts are out—she has been diagnosed. Her choice to continue eating any which way she chooses is just that—HER choice. Likewise, the choice of people to follow her cooking advice is…Just that—Leave her alone. Catch a real story. TMZ is lame.

This is worthy of your main page news? I am not sure why you even published this article, but you could have hid it under entertainment if you had to. The space on your main page should be fro important things, like hummmmm, maybe a missing child, or human slavery. Also, diabetics are allowed to eat a cheese burger and fries, they just need to adjust their insilun and track their blood sugar. Seeing this on your home page makes me not want to visit this website anymore. Thanks ABC for showing us what is really important.

What do you mean wolfing, isn’t that editorializing? What happened to privacy? Send Diane or Stephanoupolis(SP?) to cover this breaking news. ABC ought to be embarrassed, this is UK type journalism. ABC is a left wing e-rag, at least THE SUN has naked women.

Why is Paula Deen’s medical condition any of your business? Medical records are private. Besides, I’ve seen you guys eat as well and it ain’t pretty.

LEAVE THIS WOMAN ALONE! I have insulin-dependent diabetes and am on a pump and have been for over 40 years! If I want to eat a cheeseburger AND fries, that’s my business, not anyone else’s! Good lord, does everyone go around pointing fingers in people’s faces and shaming them on what they choose to eat? A diabetic can eat anything they want and know how to make adjustments to insulin doses, etc. for something they get to indulge in ONCE IN A WHILE! I had a doughnut a week ago and hot chocolate with it and just made adjustments for the sugar overload but haven’t had a donut since nor will I for months from now. Good lord, leave her alone!!!!!

Don’t we have better things to do than to“Watch”any celebrity as to what they eat in comparison to their health? Let’s criticize every Actor, Actress or any other high profile person for smoking when they’ve had cancer, eating a candy bar when they have diabetes, or seen smiling at someone other than their spouse, once they’ve been know to cheat…. Come ON!! let her eat…Its her choice, right ??

Oh, my goodness! A huge tempest in a teapot! I am happy to see that the majority of comments coincide with my thoughts–it is her life. Let the woman live it! I so enjoy watching her show, and anyone with a lick of sense knows you can cut back on fats in her recipes if you want to. Hey, even she and her son, Bobby, know that and are capitalizing on it with his new show on The Cooking Channel. It sucks enough to know you have Type 2 Diabetes, but to go public with it was brave as I am sure she knew this tempest would be created. Her personal life is that, personal, and don’t we all need to look to our own lives? Remember the golden rule–the simplest way to make good decisions–treat others as you would want to be treated.

Hugs to Paula Deen! Keep us smiling, sweetheart!

I feel it is no ones business what Paula Deen eats she can have a cheeseburger once in a while. I am a diabetic also and I have a cheeseburger once in a while. Diabetics can have what they want they don’t have to give up everything. So I think it’s time for people to give it a rest already or are diabetics suppose to starve to death.

Who care??? Diabetics can eat cheeseburgers! Isn’t there more important things to worry about than what Paula Deen eats! If you watch her shows, she does say she does not eat like this all of the time plus she also says eat this in moderation! Those people who seem to care so much about what she eats must not be listening to her show!

“Caught”eating a cheeseburger? As far as I know, it’s legal to eat a cheeseburger, it’s not marijuana or cocaine. It’s her business what she eats. When did ABC News start reporting tabloid garbage?
 
Posted by: KJ | January 26, 2012, 3:19 pm 3:19 pm
 
I also am a type 2 diabetic and with moderation you can have anything you want. Leave her alone. Just because she ate a cheeseburger and french fries, geez give her a break. How would you like it if someone followed you around and reported on everything you ate.
 
Posted by: HollieD | January 26, 2012, 3:26 pm 3:26 pm
 
I’m so glad that so many viewers responded correctly. Just because you have type 2 diabetes does NOT mean that you can not eat a cheeseburger and fries. It’s called moderation and weight control and watching your numbers. Cut us all a break and look to yourselves and what you need to improve. And while you’re reporting–how about taking on the real issues in this country instead of worrying about what a southern cooking chef is eating.

WE NEED TO MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS AND STOP MINDING EVERYONE ELSE’S. SO WHAT, PAULA DEEN HAD A CHEESEBURGER. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE MEAT WASN’T VERY LEAN. AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE FRENCH FRIES WEREN’T PERHAPS BAKED. AFTER ALL THIS WOMAN IS A CELEBRITY. SHE CAN HAVE WHAT SHE WANTS, WHEN AND HOW SHE WANTS IT.

I’m a Type 2 diabetic—a well contolled, healthy diabetic—and I eat cheeseburgers. This story is so stupid that I can’t believe it made it to the so-called“news”. Get a grip people….diabetics don’t need the“food police”like this. You’re NOT helping anyone.

I think people have a different idea of what diabetes means, yes its dangerous, it doesnt mean that you have to stop eating, its just moderation&amp;making sure your insulin is covered. my mom is a diabetic, has been for longer than i have been around&amp;she eats what everyone else eats, just she has to make sure its all covered with her insulin&amp;sometimes there are times when her sugars arent good she has to wait to eat. everyone needs to mind their own business&amp;let her live her life, she has had this long enough she knows how to take care of it on her own.

Really! Really! Come on people, she is a wonderful woman and just because someone has Diabetes Type 2 your life doesn’t stop there. You still have to eat, and what’s wrong with a cheeseburger. I believe she has enough common sense to know her own body. Who are we to judge someone by what they eat. Give her some privacy and space after all she is on vacation too. Who knows like said above she could have had a turkey burger or whatever. If this is all people have to do but monitor what people eat everyday its really sad. Leave her alone and let her live her life as she sees fit after all she is a chef !

What do you think diabetics are supposed to eat anyway? I raised a diabetic for 20 years and I always served a balance and variety of meals. ABC is sour grapes because Paula decided to use NBC to make her announcement. While I wasn’t thrilled with her choice to wait, give her a break. If she has had the disease for 3 years, then she knows what she can eat. Different foods and activities affect each person in different ways.

The more important question should be,“Why isn’t there a cure for this disease”BigPharma would never put up with that, have too much money tied up in strips; testers and everything else diabetes. Pardon my cynicism.

Posted by: gertrude | January 26, 2012, 4:13 pm 4:13 pm
 
Really, Why is everyone acting like she gave herself diabetes? There are alot of risk factors in developing diabetes most of which are genetic. The recipes she promotes are not a diet they are just that recipes. I am a 28 yr old diabetic and my great grandparents ate food like she shows everyday and lived to be over 90. Maybe people should start looking at the steroids and food processing for answers instead of the recipes.
 
Posted by: Angela Lingerfelt | January 26, 2012, 4:26 pm 4:26 pm
 
The only thing that media cares about is sticking their damn nose into someone business and turn into a freaking gossip. For those who make judgement against Paula Deen should think twice about about what they say because if you don’t have any education on Diabetic then who are you to judge? Get an education people.

So What. She is entitled to do what ever she wants. Just because she is a celbrity chef/cook who has type 2 diabeties doesn’t mean she isn’t entitled to live her own life and once in a while indulge a bit. This is a non story. Why don’t we put everyone’s lives under a microscope.
 
Posted by: Tom | January 26, 2012, 5:09 pm 5:09 pm
 
If this one just a normal celeb then there would be no story. The fact that this woman has helped to contribute to so many people eating unhealthy, and did not tell people that she had type 2 is dishonest.

I’m not sure how she could keep showing those same style of cooking to others that helped to ruin her health.

I don’t care what she eats, I do care that she shows others to eat as bad as she does when it has threatened her life.

People are so quick to say this is a non-news story, all while we have obese children and adults across our nation. Yes, nobody forced them to eat the way they did. But I won’t show support to someone making MILLIONS of dollars while smiling brightly for the cameras, and pushing unhealthy recipes. If her recipes and eating habits really aren’t that bad, than she shouldn’t be spokesperson for the diabetes drug. She can’t play both sides of the fence. Defend her behavior all you want, but deep down I find it highly unlikely that most of you cook her recipes in your own homes, especially the posters who say they have diabetes.

Now she’s going to hawk a medication for diabetes?
Who the hell does she think she is?
She’s not the first nor the last person in the world that will have diabetes!
If she would lose weight and STOP EATING ALL THAT CRAP SHE EATS, she could reverse it!
She should be ashamed of herself!
I don’t wish her harm but on the other hand, I could care less about her!

Who made TMZ the damn food police??? As a person who has Type 2 Diabetes she is ALLOWED to eat a cheeseburger–YOU CAN EAT EVERYTHING SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE DIABETES–you do have to watch your carb count and blood sugar . I am aware that Mr. Levin is an attorney, but dies he (or any of his gang of snarky minions, have an MD after their names). What Ms Deen eats is her (and her dietician/doctors) business. AGAIN–the key to any successful diabetic program is MODERATION. She can eat anything a“normal”person can–she just has to watch when and where (and OBVIOUSLY not in front of a snarky camera toting tourist)

People, please stop the hating. (not all of you). I also have diabetes 2 and I know I can have a cheeseburger and fries occasionally if I want. It’s just not something we can eat everyday.
Leave Paula alone, this is a difficult time for her, she doesn’t need to be constantly criticized by people who know no better.
God Bless Paula.
 
Posted by: KARIN | January 26, 2012, 7:55 pm 7:55 pm
 
The only thing Paula did that could be difficult for people to get over is not telling people“Look I just found out I have diabetes so I am going to still make the same foods that I have always made and love but I’m going to try to make them a little healthier in light of my diabetes”right when she found out, not two years later. It looks bad that she’s continued to have the same fatty foods and still knowing she had diabetes. Does she say you have to eat that food all the time or not have healthy food also? No of course not. But the message is that she eats that because she cooks it on her show and shares how to make it with everyone. She should’ve come clean about it in the beginning and had healthy options. The ONLY reason she even said she has it is because she’s promoting a diabetes drug, so it was strictly for professional gain.

Wow..she got CAUGHT eating a cheeseburger. This is a NON story. The fact that she has diabetes should be a NON story. Paula Deen has a right to COOK and EAT whatever the hell she likes. If you don’t like it…don’t eat it…don’t watch her show. Nobody is forcing anyone.

I am pretty sure that all of these“Paula lovers”are fat and that is why they are on the defensive! This woman had diabetes for 2 YEARS and kept promoting unhealthy eating! It’s not about the hamburger, idiiots!! It’s about an unhealthy lifestyle that is killing many Americans who keep indulging on fast food, greasy burgers, fries, etc. Just betting that when she loses a limb from gangrene or goes into diabetic shock, she’ll maybe start promoting a healthier way of living. Until then, all of you just keep going into the McDonald’s drive thru, sit on your fat asses and diss others who have some sense about healthy eating and living longer! Only in America!!!

ABC has never been to the south have they? Does the station air down there? Any way, I call ABC out on being hypocritical. They vary well know that you judge a culture by its standards not by another. This is a rule of sociology. So they are being politically incorrect in attacking Paula. I hate political correctness by the way. For them to attack Paula on being a participant in her culture and not a Muslim in the middle east with three teenage wives for simply participating in his culture shows they follow popular opinion and not simply the news.

Don’t forget hypoglycemia ..then one eats ,or one will go comatose and perhaps die . I’ve heard of a few, and personally known at least one who died having a brutal hypoglycemia .. problem . I know. I’ve been there . I eat very Little junk food, and weigh very little , but during severe hypoglycemia , raising the blood sugar level is imperative . People so often judge and dismiss diabetic people, although we have to be self disciplined 24/7…just to keep living, and that self discipline can be used in other areas…. many diabetics downplay it , because of horrible prejudice . . I read Sharon Stone is a juvenile diabetic . There is a surprising list, somewhere . People think it must nt be that bad if people can accomplish things . It is that bad .People just grit their teeth and do whatever is needed to be done anyway . Used to just doing it . whatever it may be .

OMG Paula Deen eating? CALL THE COPS…. get REAL people…she is a person and although she should eat in a way that is more healthy, there is nothing wrong with eating a cheeseburger…. although she is noted for her high fat and calorie dishes, its her choice to eat as she pleases. I don’t agree with some of her choices and sometimes I make bad choices myself, but I try not to get too bent about it…just work at making better choices daily. I hope that EVERYONE would adopt a better philosophy of TRYING to make better personal choices, but sometimes we fail…. people…imperfect…live with it. I wish Paula Deen ALL the luck in the world with her work and her health…she seems like a very nice person…. but a bit of the top sometimes…but I prefer that over negative people any day!

We waste our time judging and publishing what a famous person eats rather than worrying about the national healthcare problem or maybe even….. an issue about the other countries in the world. Who the hell cares! This was a ridiculous article and whoever wrote it should be fired. ABC and TMZ, you should be ashamed of yourselves. In fact you should print an apology to this poor lady who is suffering from an illness and made a mistake like humans tend to do. She just happens to famous and have idiots like you tracking her every move rather then reporting actual news. If you want to criticize something, criticize the 300lb pts I treat in the hospital everyday who are there for high blood pressure, diabetes, and a heart attack. Somehow, they always manage to have their families sneak in a bucket of KFC!

Was it a beef burger and not a turkey or chicken burger or even a veggie burger? Either way big whoop. If it is news worthy she must have eaten a large platter filled with cheeseburgers. Wow with all that is going on in the world all we have to be concerned with is Ms Paula enjoying a Cheeseburger. All is right with the world there is world peace except the ripple of a cheeseburger being ate by Paula Deen. Oh know the world is coming to and end Paula ate a cheeseburger.

I work in a hospital and Diabetics are allowed to eat Cheeseburgers. It“costs”2 carbs but that’s perfectly okay. Stupid story is stupid, who ever posted this crap here shouldn’t have that job.

I’ve never seen such idiots as the people trying to destroy her. What’s the deal? She ate a burger. If she was a hateful, horrible person, such as Madonna she would get a pass on everything. I get so sick of the hypocrisy in the media. Give Paula a break!

More proof that we don’t have news media anymore. ABC, this story was bad, bad, bad. Stick to real news, and learn something about diabetics.

All these“adult bullies”like Anthony Bourdain and these so-called“chefs”are so envious of Paula and her very strong fan base and her ability to relate to“real people”: Long time ago, I watched one program of Anthony Bourdain and was so turned off by his arrogance, the choice offood he ate, the high volume of his alcohol consumption and other disgusting habits. Any diabetic knows that you can eat hamburgers and most any foods by living a balanced lifestyle. Stop the bullying!

PLEASE !!! SO What ! Just because you have diabetes does not mean that you cannot indulge every now and then. She should know what she can and cannot have.. Leave her alone, This is just a ploy for“THE NOSEY”to get another story on a celebrity…. My husband has diabetes and as long as he takes his meds., eats the right foods for most of the week. He can have some choices that are not so great. ALL In Moderation…Get another Celebrity to ANNOY :( You Go Paula….

As long as her diabetes it under control and she is being careful there is no problem in eating whatever you want to! Geesh go find something really newsworthy to report on will ya!?

I am really irritated by all the hype surrounding Paula Dean. She hosts a COOKIING show for goodness sake. She is an entertainer and shows us all how to make southern food. She is not unlike Emerill who cooks with tons of butter, Mario Batali who makes pasta and both of them are in less than great shape. Are we really asking CELEBRITY chefs to cook only healthy food now? And, disclose all of their personal health issues? Paula is a wonderful lady who I LOVE to watch cook. I’m not going to cook her food every day, but once in a while is ok. Don’t you critics go out to a restaurants and eat food that isn’t necessarily healthy for you? Do you get mad at the restaurant owner for serving rich dishes? Are restaurant owners with health issues going to be the next target? Leave Paula alone!
