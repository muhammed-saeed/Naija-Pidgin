 Tipping 
Restaurants do not include a service charge in the bill, so you should
tip the waiter 15% of the total bill. If service was slow or
particularly bad, some Americans will tip only 10%. Likewise, if
service was particularly good, it is appropriate to tip 20%. If
service was so bad that you would never eat in the restaurant again,
leave two cents. This is a deliberate insult, because it tells the
waiter that you didn&apos;t forget to leave a tip. Tipping is only
appropriate in restaurants which offer table service. You do not tip
the cashier in a fast food restaurant.
The words &quot;tip&quot; and &quot;gratuity&quot; are used interchangeably, with
&quot;gratuity&quot; having a slightly more formal connotation.
Taxi drivers expect to get a tip equal to 15% of the total fare. If
the driver was especially helpful or got you to your destination more
quickly than you expected, give a 20% tip.
Hotel bellhops expect a $1 tip for helping you with your bags. If you
order room service, the gratuity is included in the bill. Coat
checkroom attendants expect $1 per coat. Hairdressers and barbers
expect a tip of 15% of the bill. Valet parking attendants expect a $1
tip.
Federal regulations prohibit letter carriers from accepting cash gifts
in any amount, or gifts worth $20 or more from customers.
If you are in doubt, ask whether it is appropriate to tip or whether a
gratuity is included in the bill.
Bribery is not considered appropriate and often illegal. Attempting to
bribe a
policeman will certainly get you arrested.
