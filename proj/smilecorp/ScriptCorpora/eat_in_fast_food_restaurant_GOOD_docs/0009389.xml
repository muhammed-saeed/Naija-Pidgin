   Motorsports Hall of Fame   (Site not responding. Last check: 2007-11-04) Much of this can be attributed to the career efforts of Bill &quot;Grumpy&quot; Jenkins , whose then-innovative use of his mechanical engineering skills in the mid-1950s not only produced many of drag racing&apos;s most successful vehicles, but also helped rid the sport of its former leather jacket-illegal street racing image. With a NHRA Nationals Super Stock victory in 1967, Jenkins became known as drag racing&apos;s premier builder of normally aspirated stock engines, and achieved even greater success when the new Pro Stock category was introduced in 1970. Jenkins earned the &quot;Grumpy&quot; moniker through his no-nonsense attitude at races, where his continual search for improved performance left little time for idle chatter with his racing colleagues. www.mshf.com /hof/jenkins_bill.htm  (472 words)

   Tobacco buyout bill expected in House=The Hill.com=   (Site not responding. Last check: 2007-11-04) The bill , written by Rep. Bill Jenkins (R-Tenn.), differs from many earlier proposals in both its size and how it is funded, changes that many lawmakers hope will give new life to an issue that stalled last year in both the House and Senate. Jenkins , chairman of the House Agriculture Committee’s subcommittee on Specialty Crops and Foreign Agriculture Programs, is expected to propose a bill that would pay $9.6 billion over five years to farmers and to owners of quota units called allotments, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by The Hill. The bill would direct the secretary of agriculture to divert a portion of the revenues generated by the federal excise tax, approximately 5 cents out of 39 cents, to fund the buyout. www.hillnews.com /business/032304_tobacco.aspx  (809 words) 
 
 

    
   No. 8: Bill Jenkins Jenkins more than justified his compensation by driving his new 375-horsepower, 396-cid &apos;67 Camaro in the expanded Super Stock category at the year&apos;s biggest race, the Nationals. An untested short-wheelbase Vega that Jenkins built for the 1972 season was held to a subpar 9.90 to qualify a disappointing 17th for the 32-car field at the season-opening Winternationals. Jenkins &apos; subsequent limited Pro Stock efforts were highlighted by Joe Lepone&apos;s victory at the 1985 Winternationals with a Jenkins engine, but &quot;the Grump&apos;s&quot; primary focus was on Comp engines, which helped propel Steve Johns, Bob Kaiser, and Garley Daniels to season titles. www.nhra.com /50th/top50/B_Jenkins08.html  (1503 words)
