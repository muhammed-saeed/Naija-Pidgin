 I have made my first few purchases on a Chase Freedom card. Of the 15 categories that are supposed to provide 3% cash back (for the 3 top spending areas per month) I have made purchases at the following:   Grocery Stores Beauty Salons/Spas   The Grocery Store (Kroger) was listed as &quot;Other&quot; on my online transaction detail.   The Beauty Salon (Visible Changes) was listed as Dining and Entertainment.   I am assuming that since the Program Rules and Regulations state that they are not responsible for the merchants&apos; coding of the proper categories, that I will not be getting the 3% credit for these purchases.   Is this coding of categories a typical problem with other cards for purchases that should get special bonuses?

 Wait until after your closing date, and then view your statement. Last month, on my transaction detail, I had a deli purchase listed as &quot;Other&quot; and a fast food restaurant listed as Dining and Entertainment. When my billing statement generated, they were both properly categorized as &quot;Quick Service Restaurants,&quot; and I received the appropriate 3% credit.

Wow, that sounds like way more work than I want to do for a card... * Credit is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master. * Who&apos;s the boss --you or your credit?

 My Chase Freedom Cash World card just generated the first statement. I did get &quot;bonus&quot; credit for some of my &quot;top three&quot; categories even though the online transaction detail descriptions had left me wondering if I would.   I got the 2% bonus credit for &quot;Grocery Stores&quot; (Kroger ... that had been listed as &quot;other&quot; in the online detail) and &quot;Gas&amp;Convenience Stores&quot; (Murphy Oil @ Walmart ... which surprised me because I thought the association with Walmart would disqualify this gasoline purchase.) However, the Visible Changes purchase that had been described online as &quot;Dining and Entertainment&quot; did not get bonus credit as a beauty salon.    I do not like the information detail on the Chase credit card statements. They give a rewards summary, but the transaction detail does not show how the individual transactions were categorized. I had to manually calculate the totals in the categories (guessing as to which transactions were included in a specific categories) to determine if my rewards points were calculated as I had expected.   And .. in this day and age of credit card fraud, I really don&apos;t like the credit card account number being printed on the statement. Our mail service is HORRIBLE, and our mail is frequently delivered to someone else. I think it is time to consider electronic delivery only.    Message 5 of 12 (4,964 Views) Reply psychic Moderator Emeritus Posts: 1,518 Registered: 04-20-2007

 Chase is not the only one that doesn&apos;t provide a great deal of rewards summary detail--Citibank doesn&apos;t either. I have a Citibank Dividend Platinum Select MC, and their statements also don&apos;t show how individual transactions are categorized for bonus rewards.

 I guess it&apos;s time for me to hit the &quot;secure message center&quot; for my Chase recommendations.

It is only listed as &quot;rewards available&quot; right now. It appears that I will have to redeem the reward points for a check.

 I have a new Chase Freedom card, and also found Kroger listed as &quot;other.&quot; Also, Petco was listed as &quot;other,&quot; rather than veterinary products. My local vet was listed as &quot;other&quot; as well. They did list a coffee shop as a restaurant. I have other Chase cards, and they get the categories right the first time! In addition, the rewards part of the site did NOT list checks. I&apos;ll wait for my first statement, and then see if they get the categories right. Message 10 of 12 (4,586 Views) Reply
