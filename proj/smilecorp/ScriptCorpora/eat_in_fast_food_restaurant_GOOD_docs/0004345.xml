 A Matter of Perspective 
 by SMSLewis on May 27th, 2012 0     0 0   
 In a fast food restaurant, a woman sat down at a table that was covered with trash left from the last customer. The woman’s perception was, “What a mess! This restaurant is filthy!” Instead of leaving the clutter, the woman cleaned up the existing mess and made sure not to also leave her trash behind when she was finished eating.

The next customer who sat down at that same spot saw a clean table and thought, “Wow! This restaurant is so clean!”

 Moral: Perception is a matter of timing. 

Think of life events that changed the way you think of things. Before September 11, 2001, the United States was a safe place to live, flying was a quick and convenient way to travel, and in the original Spiderman movie, the Twin Towers were backdrops for Spiderman’s web . If you remember the events of that day and all the days that followed, you saw how these perceptions changed. The United States became paranoid of terrorists, flying evolved into a long and painful process, and the movie trailer with Spiderman’s web strung across the Twin Towers is considered inappropriate.

Possibly now, more than ever, you have the opportunity to create your own perception of the history you are living. Your generation captures more actual moments and responds publically to more everyday events than was ever possible in the past. You snap pictures with your phones, write blogs about everything, and post to Twitter and Facebook with unabashed frankness. Your mere access to the Internet allows you to have an abundance of information from more sources than ever could have been imagined.

In addition, your impression of current events is not controlled solely by newspapers, TV, or a single Internet news source. Often you can access information posted by actual witnesses as well as hear the voices of others who share personal insight and information. This gives you power that past generations never imagined or could attempt to locate on their own. You can refute what you are “told” you are seeing (“pay no attention to the man behind the curtain”), freeing you to investigate your own ideas for clarity and truth. And while you still may face some unscrupulous sources who post fraudulent information, be assured that there is enough true information on the Internet for you to sort through.  

You are becoming the curators of your own history.

How will you present your own experience of life to the future?

  A New Social Trend 
 by SMSLewis on March 27th, 2012 0     0 0   
 Hi. 
 With the use of Social Media many of us seem to be more attentive to people who are not really there. We use our cell phones in public, text while eating meals with other people, post Facebook remarks while attending sporting events with friend. So, how are we treating the live humans around us? Do we acknowledge they exist or are they just background scenery? 

 Imagine, for a moment, that your cell phone died. Now don’t go into a meltdown, it is only for a short moment and you will get it charged soon, I promise.   Okay, now imagine you are in a public place and you are in line at a fast food restaurant. You don’t have your phone in your hand and you walk up to the counter to give your order. Did you look at that person? Did you exchange anything beyond, “A number 4 to go”? What? I can’t hear you. I’ll make it a little simpler. Did you say three words in that total conversation that weren’t related to your food order?   Probably not. Why? Well, perhaps because dealing with live humans can sometimes be awkward. 

 Think about it. What do you say when you greet a friend? “Sup.” And when you leave? “Later.” What more do you need to say? But would you do the same in an elevator when the other person riding with you is a stranger? Or at the gas station when you go inside and the person behind the counter isn’t someone you know?   Are you lost for words? No worries, you are not alone. 

 I propose you become a pioneer in new event that I will call “Being Social”. It is for all those times when you are face-to-face with someone and you need to make some sort of exchange that doesn’t require a committed relationship. You can start with people behind the counter, if you want, since you probably don’t take elevators on a regular basis. And there aren’t a lot of rules to this event, so getting started shouldn’t be that painful. 

 Ready? Okay. You walk up to the counter at the fast food restaurant and you actually look the person in the eyes before you give your order. Now, here is where “being social” takes its first daring step. Before you give your order you say one word. “Hi”. That’s it, just “hi”. Cool, isn’t it. Already you are taking a foot in a whole new direction with this person. Deep breaths, now, because you are on a roll. After you give your order the last step in “being social” are two words, “thank you”. You can say it at any time, actually, since those two words hold a lot of meanings. You can say it when you get your change, your receipt, or your order. Just say, “thank you,” and you’re done! Wow! 

 First off, congrats! Great job! I couldn’t have done better myself. 

 Now I want to give you the inside scoop on “being social.” If you get into the habit of practicing and spreading this everywhere you go, I believe the other people around you will actually start imitating you and it can become a growing phenomenon. In fact, this type of social behavior was actually used a few decades ago, so you might say that you are being “retro” when you practice it. And who knows, it might actually become a growing trend again. The best part of “being social” is that it makes the person on the receiving end feel good, and isn’t that part of this whole “social” stuff? Connecting with others in a good way? Great! Now spread the word! 

 Thank you! 
 Fairy Tales Were Not For Children 
 by SMSLewis on December 8th, 2011 1     0 0   
 Fairy tales were probably the Urban Legends of their time. Set in dark, scary forests filled with wolves, woodcutters, and witches, they resemble today’s creepy basement or dark house on a stormy night. You could almost scream,“Don’t!” but too late, and in walks some strange creature wielding an ax. In the end the heroine usually wins, even if it will take weeks to wash the blood and grime out of her hair. What? You thought fairy tales were just stories told to children to help them get to sleep at night? Hmmm, guess you have been reading the wrong versions.

In 1812 Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published the first volume of“Children and Household Tales.” It wasn’t a storybook for children but rather a collection of oral stories about children and household tales that was intended to preserve German language, tradition, and identity. Many of the tales were gathered from stories told by women at spinning wheels to pass the time, and some were shared by travelers at gathering places such as pubs and inns. In a time where entertainment consisted mostly of talk, storytelling filled the imagination, and intrigue and danger were easy to feel while the light of a fireplace danced on the cold stone walls. And since these tales used common elements all people could share, such as the mysterious woods and noble kings, it was easy to set the stage for an audience in any town.

It wasn’t until the 4th printing of“Children and Household Tales” that pictures were added, the storylines softened for children, and moral lessons became more pronounced. Think of it as a smart marketing move by Wilhelm Grimm, who saw a growing literate audience and noticed that Europe was publishing stories to be read to children. Still, some of the harsh flavor of the times continued in these tales and the wicked in the stories were cruelly punished. Perhaps it was their way of fighting back at injustices they saw in society, or a way to feel empowered against the evil that lurked in the night. Either way, in the end good always triumphed“and they lived happily ever after” - an ending we appreciate even today.

Our fascination with fairy tales still grows strong. As 2012 marks 200 years since the first printing of the Grimms’“Children and Household Tales”, their stories continue to be retold, reshaped, and renamed in books, plays, movies, and television. Recent movies such as“Beastly” and“Red Riding Hood”, and the television series“Once Upon a Time” and“Grimm”, are evidence that there is more to fairy tales than just soothing stories told to children at bedtime. Adults, too, like to be scared and are intrigued by the things that go bump in the night, as long as we don’t go into the basement.
