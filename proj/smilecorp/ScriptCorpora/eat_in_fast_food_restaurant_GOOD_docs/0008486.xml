Caller ID Problem The handset does not display the callers name and/or phone number. Cause/solution L You have not subscribed to Caller ID service. Contact your telephone service provider to subscribe. L If your base unit is connected to any additional telephone equipment such as a Caller ID box or cordless telephone jack, disconnect the base unit from the equipment and plug the base unit directly into the wall jack. L If your base unit is connected to a telephone line with DSL service, we recommend connecting a noise filter between the base unit and the telephone line jack. Contact your DSL provider for details. L The name display service may not be available in some areas. Contact your telephone service provider for details. L Other telephone equipment may be interfering with this unit. Disconnect the other equipment and try again. L The caller requested not to send caller information (page 32). L If a call is being transferred to you, the caller information is not displayed. L Generally, caller information is displayed from the 2nd ring. L The Caller ID number auto edit feature is turned off. Turn it on and try again (page 37). L You need to call back the edited number to activate Caller ID number auto edit. L The phone number you dialed might have an incorrectly edited pattern (for example, the long distance 1 or the area code is missing). Edit the phone number with another pattern (page 33).

The caller list/incoming phone numbers are not edited automatically. I cannot dial the phone number edited in the caller list.
TG6700.book Page 61 Monday, April 24, 2006 10:28 AM
Problem The 2nd callers information is not displayed during an outside call. Cause/solution L In order to use Caller ID, Call Waiting, or Call Waiting Caller ID (CWID), you must first contact your telephone service provider and subscribe to the desired service. After subscribing, you may need to contact your telephone service provider again to activate this specific service, even if you already subscribed to both Caller ID and Call Waiting with Caller ID services (CWID).
Answering system Problem I cannot listen to messages from a remote location. The unit does not record new messages. Cause/solution L A touch tone phone is required for remote operation. L Enter the remote code correctly (page 45). L The answering system is off. Turn it on (page 46). L The answering system is not turned on for the line you wish to record messages from. Select the desired line or both lines by pressing {LINE SELECT} repeatedly, then turn the answering system on (page 40, 46). L The recording time is set to Greeting only. Select a different setting (page 47). L The message memory is full. Erase unnecessary messages (page 42). L The answering system is activated for both lines, and the 1st caller is leaving a voice message. The 2nd caller cannot leave a message, but the caller information will be stored (page 33). L If you subscribe to the Voice Mail service, messages are recorded by the telephone service provider not your telephone (page 47). L Someone is operating the answering system. L If someone is talking on a conference call, you cannot operate the answering system. Try again later. L New messages have been recorded. Listen to the new messages (page 42, 43).
I cannot operate the answering system. The message indicator on the handset slowly flashes in amber.

Full description

Now it&apos;s easier to enjoy all the benefits of the functional, fashionable and flexible phone systems. With two-line operation, you can conference in two outside lines to have a three-way conversation. Or place your current call on hold to make another call. Being able to use two phone lines with just one phone makes it convenient and efficient to manage your calls. You can put handsets all over your house-in your kid&apos;s rooms or even in the garage-without all the messy wiring or complicated setup. With the 5.8 GHz expandable phone systems, you don&apos;t need a phone jack for each additional handset-just one for the base unit. So start expanding and forget about all your wiring worries. The 5.8 GHz Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum technology operates on a different wavelength with much less traffic maintaining the great security, incredible clarity and long range. Have a wireless computer network, or thinking about getting one? 5.8 GHz technology will not interfere with wireless networks such as 802.11b or 802.11g WiFi. This phone system is equipped with an all-digital answering system for quick, easy retrieval of crystal-clear messages. Message operation has never been easier, with up to 60 minutes of recording time, plus such features as pre-recorded outgoing message, remote operation, Tollsaver, and skip-and-repeat. And don&apos;t worry about losing your messages when the power goes out-they&apos;re stored in flash memory so they&apos;re unaffected by power failure or interruptions. Kids sleeping? The antenna will signal you silently! The tip of the antenna - which lights up red - will alert you to an incoming call (or a message waiting for you). So turn off the ringer, let the kids sleep, and never miss a call.
