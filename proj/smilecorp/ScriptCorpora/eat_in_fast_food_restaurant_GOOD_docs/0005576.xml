Girl Backs It Up On Co-Worker While Taking Drive-Thru Order At Fast Food Restaurant [VIDEO]

Whenever I drive-thru at my favorite fast food joints, I always have the image of the voice on the other end of the speaker standing at a register while swiftly and correctly putting my order into the computer. After all, when I get to the window to pay, that is usually the common scenario. After today, my whole perception of the person wearing the headset on the other end of the drive-thru speaker has changed! 

The next time you drive-thru at your favorite fast food restaurant, just know that you really have NO clue what could possibly be going on inside!
