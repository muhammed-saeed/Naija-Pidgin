WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge has long been a hub of innovation, ideas and action but in order to stay in the forefront, we must continue to adapt and challenge the status quo; and
WHEREAS: Cambridge must find new ways to push the envelope in how we offer services to our constituents and to make our City government work better for the families that live here; and
WHEREAS: The City of Boston has recently opened the Department of Urban Mechanics that will develop and implement new ideas that improve City service delivery, such as next generation applications for the City&apos;s Citizens Connect iPhone suite. The office will also focus on tapping into local sources of innovation including residents, employees, communities and institutions; and
WHEREAS: Additionally, many cities have created mobile apps to make it easier to communicate with City Hall. Some examples include SeeClickFix, CitizensConnect, and DC31. Additional examples of how governments are using new web 2.0 tools can be seen by the thousands of Twitter and Facebook accounts of government officials, allowing them to directly interact with their constituents; and
WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge&apos;s greatest resource is its citizens. If we can somehow facilitate greater interaction between our city&apos;s entrepreneurs and City staff, the entire region will benefit; and
WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge would greatly benefit from a program similar to that of Boston&apos;s that will foster entrepreneurs and innovation and improve communication and delivery of services to our constituents; and
WHEREAS: The hope here is that by making it easier to connect with City Hall more people will be engaged in their community. It is by no means a substitute for interaction in City Council meetings but it can help with collaboration and exchange of ideas. Technology empowers people to interact with government in a way that is more efficient and transparent; now therefore be it
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Budget Department and direct the appropriate department heads to create a similar program in Cambridge and report back to the City Council with a funding and human resource plan to implement such a program.

WHEREAS: The theme of this year&apos;s International Women&apos;s Day is Equal access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work for women; and
WHEREAS: Women in the US have made some progress in securing equal rights, and professional success; the reality remains that across the globe women and girls are held back by institutionalized patriarchy, which is reinforced by cultural and religious values; and
WHEREAS: The UN Millennium Development Goals, an integrated set of eight goals and 18 time-bound targets for extending the benefits of globalization to the world&apos;s poorest citizens, seeks to empower girls by eliminating gender disparity in education at all levels by 2015, a goal which, sadly, will not be attained but to which the international community must continue to aspire; and

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
WHEREAS: One of the defining qualities of our city is that we are a caring, compassionate community with a deep distaste for what is not fair; and
WHEREAS: We are all susceptible to illness, but our affliction ought not to determine whether we have a roof over our head or are cast unto the streets. In the case of Mr. Kanti Prakash of 2 Leonard Avenue in Cambridge, this seems to be the case; and
WHEREAS: In January 2008 Mr. Prakash was rushed to Cambridge Hospital because of difficulty breathing. In February 2008, Mr. Prakash was moved to Youville Hospital, from which he was released two and a half years later on June 15, 2010 in poorer health; and
WHEREAS: Medicare covered the first 100 days of medical expenses related to Mr. Prakash&apos;s hospitalization, and Mr. Prakash&apos;s private insurance covered medical bills until June 2009, an amount Mr. Prakash&apos;s family estimates to be over $2,000,000; and
WHEREAS: During Mr. Prakash&apos;s hospitalization, Youville Hospital was bought by Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Now Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital wants to recuperate the sum of $648,592.95 from the Prakash family, most of it the result of an exorbitant daily room charge of $4,400 per day; and
WHEREAS: Many questions exist about the quality of the care Mr. Prakash received while at Spaulding, the duration of his stay there, and the degree to which his family was consulted about Mr. Prakash&apos;s treatments. For instance, Mr. Prakash was diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s, but his family was not informed of the diagnosis until much later. Mr. Prakash was also put on medications without informing his family; and
WHEREAS: During the course of his hospitalization at Youville and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Mr. Prakash contracted many infections which prolonged the duration of his stay in the hospital; and
WHEREAS: The Prakash family made several attempts to move Mr. Prakash from Youville Hospital to MGH or Beth Israel, but time and again, they were told that Mr. Prakash was too sick to make the short trips to MGH or to Beth Israel; now therefore be it
RESOLVED: That Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Cambridge should remove the lien on the Prakash home on Leonard Avenue in Cambridge and desist from any further attempts to appropriate the Prakash home; and be it further
RESOLVED: That Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Cambridge should assemble an independent team of medical doctors to examine Mr. Prakash&apos;s medical records in order to determine if his extremely long stay in the hospital was medically warranted and to determine if the spate of infections Mr. Prakash suffered while in the hospital, which contributed to his long stay there, could have been avoided; and be it further
RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested forward suitably engrossed copies of this resolution to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Cambridge and to the Prakash family on behalf of the entire City Council.

Present at the meeting were Councillor Leland Cheung, Chair of the Committee; Councillor E. Denise Simmons; Robert W. Healy, City Manager; Louis DePasquale, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs; Michelle Kincaid, Director of Financial Systems/Operators; Estella Johnson, Director, Economic Development Department, Community Development Department (CDD); Pardis Saffari, Economic Development Division, CDD; Elizabeth Bedell; Muna Kangsen; and Donna P. Lopez, Deputy City Clerk.

Also present were Chuck Van Hise, Cambridge Savings Bank; Karen Kindle, Cambridge Savings Bank; Patricia Mullin, Cambridge Trust Company; Manuel Rodriguez, East Cambridge Savings Bank; Laury Hammel, Janneke House, Joshua Gerber and Frank Kramer, Cambridge Local First; Terrence F. Smith, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce; Gavin Kleespies, Cambridge Historical Society; and Michael Kanter, Cambridge Naturals.

Councillor Cheung opened the meeting and stated the purpose. He asked for the process and timeline of the bidding process as well as impediments for local banks to compete in this process.

City Manager Robert W. Healy gave an overview of the City&apos;s Investment Policy (Attachment A) which was adopted by the City Council and is contained in the City&apos;s budget. He stated that investments are restricted by state law. He stated that the City bids out its banking services. He stated that the bid is granted in 3-year increments and that Citizens Bank currently serves the City&apos;s banking services as it was the lowest bidder for the contract. He stated that this bid expires in May, 2012. The new bid process will begin in November or December. He stated that currently coin counting is included with the contract but will be excluded from the next bid contract as to motivate locally owned banks to apply. He stated that the coin counting process is very labor intensive and there are standards that need to be adhered to. He stated that the reason for this is that quarters from parking meters need to be counted, balanced and deposited. The banks must also meet standard for strong
business practices.

City Manager Healy explained that the City of Cambridge actively tries to involve local banks during times of high revenue streams by making cash investments in Certificates of Deposit. He stated that every week the city spends approximately six million dollars in payroll and that the City generates approximately 200-500 checks per week. He stated that vendor payments can range anywhere from $50.00 to $1,000,000.00 so it can be difficult to gage how much money will be available in any given time period to invest in local banks. He stated that Citizens Bank receives $92,000.00 per year to service the City&apos;s accounts which is not a large profit. Lock boxes are located at Cambridge Trust and they receive $19,000.00 for this service. He agreed with the theory that Cambridge should keep its business local and stated that by removing the coin counting from future bids, this will open the process up to more local banks.

Councillor Simmons questioned whether the coin counting could be done in-house. City Manager Healy stated that he is exploring that option but that it is a double-edged sword but that he would not rule that option out. Councillor Simmons asked how the City informs the banks of the bid process. Mr. Healy stated that information regarding bids is listed on the City&apos;s home page as well as the bid being sent out to the banks individually.

Councillor Cheung posed the question of collateralization. Michelle Kincaid stated that deposits to accounts are required to be collateralized for safety purposes. It is the in the best interest of the City to keep the taxpayers&apos; money safe and risk-free.

Councillor Cheung asked about payroll, vendor and tax accounts. Mr. Healy stated that money gets moved from different accounts to meet immediate needs as necessary. He stated that when there is significant revenue increases, CD&apos;s are offered as low as $250,000.00 to draw interest from smaller banks.

Councillor Cheung then opened the meeting to the bank representatives.

Karen Kindle, Cambridge Savings Bank, stated that Cambridge Savings Banks works with other municipalities. She stated that there is a way to get around the coin counting issues such as using outside contractors to weigh, verify and deposit the funds into accounts. She stated that Cambridge Savings Bank is excited to bid for the City&apos;s accounts in the future.

Patricia Mullin, Cambridge Trust, stated that she is a member of the National Treasury Group and will research options on coin counting. Cambridge Trust precluded bidding on Cambridge banking services because of their inability to provide coin counting during the last bid process.

Manuel Rodriguez, East Cambridge Savings Bank, stated that the coin counting is an issue but there are ways to resolve it. ECSB has a good relationship with the City.

Frank Kramer, Co-Chair, Cambridge Local First, thanked all present for their attendance. He stated that he has conducted research and that studies indicate that the more money that goes into local banks, the better the City&apos;s economy. He stated that the big banks have caused the financial mess and that local banks are for the most part thriving and contributing to the community. He believes that if money is put in local banks than it will stay within the city. He questioned the operating account of the City and whether checks to vendors come out of the Citizens Bank account. Robert Healy responded in the affirmative and stated that most of the City&apos;s payroll goes through the process of a direct deposit system. Payments to vendors are processed by multiple City departments such as the City Manager and Auditor who must sign warrants on all payments before checks are issued in order to keep safeguards and security in place.

Mr. Hammel then questioned how many accounts the City has and Michelle Kincaid answered that the City has approximately thirty. Mr. Hammel asked if there was any way to spread those accounts to local banks. Mr. Healy stated that there is no advantage to separation of accounts and cited the regulation entitled Bank Procurement Guide for Municipalities from the Inspector General. Mr. Hammel asked if any of the accounts are independent and specific in that they could be assigned to a local bank. Mr. Healy answered in the negative and reiterated that the City tries to include local banks by way of CD&apos;s when there is a surplus in funds. He stated that the City of Cambridge currently has CD&apos;s in nine different banks.

Mr. Hammel stated that although the banks do not make large profits maintaining the accounts, they do make profits in bank fees. He stated employees are also motivated to open accounts with the winning bid bank, as to streamline their finances. He stated that Cambridge is fortunate to have three local banks worth a billion dollars. He commented that local banks can provide services of safety and security and questioned measures of security.

Mr. Healy stated that the Affordable Housing projects are made possible by local banks. He commented that the local banks have been great and he did not need to be convinced of their merits. He welcomes competition at all levels and agrees with the principles of Cambridge Local First.

Councillor Simmons said that Cambridge Local First reminded the attendees of the importance of doing business locally. She hopes that by modifying the bidding process, and attracting more local banks to compete, that it will generate the community aspect and connections that does not exist with larger banks.

Karen Kindle, Cambridge Savings Bank, asked when the last time that the City changed banks was. Mr. Healy stated that the last transition was in 1997 and that the City has been with Citizen&apos;s Bank ever since. He stated that in the past the City worked with Century Bank, US Trust/Charles Bank and Bay Bank Harvard Trust. He stated that the decision to take the coin counting aspect out of the bidding process will maximize potential for local banks to bid.

Josh Gerber, Cambridge Local First and owner of 1369 Coffee, questioned the factors related to community investment. Mr. Healy responded that the banks are required to comply with the Community Investment Act but that the bidding contract could not include specific provisions beyond this act to mandate community involvement.

Frank Kramer, Cambridge Local First, stated that he met with the presidents of the local banks who stated that they were very impressed by the management and administration of the City of Cambridge, specifically in regards to their leadership during the financial crisis.

Councillor Cheung thanked those present for their participation. The meeting adjourned at 9:55am.

For the Committee,
Councillor Leland Cheung, Chair
 
 Committee Report #2 
The Economic Development, Training and Employment Committee conducted a public meeting on Tues, Jan 25, 2011 at 4:09pm in the Sullivan Chamber.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss reviewing ordinances detrimental to community goals.

Present at the meeting were Councillor Leland Cheung, Chair of the Committee; Councillor Sam Seidel; Councillor Kenneth Reeves; Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis; Susan Glazer, Acting Assistant City Manager for Community Development Department (CDD); Stuart Dash, Director of Community Planning, CDD; Estella Johnson, Economic Development Division Director of CDD; Christopher Basler, Economic Development Division of CDD; Elizabeth Bedell; John Clifford; and Donna P Lopez, Deputy City Clerk.

Also present were Kelly Thompson Clark and Terrence Smith, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce; Sarah Gallup, MIT; Renie Farster, President, Inman Square Business Association (ISBA); and Tom Lynn, Secretary, ISBA; Patrick Barrett, Central Square Business Association (CSBA); Joe Maguire, Vice President of Development, Alexandria Real Estate; Travis McCready, Executive Director Kendall Square Association, (KSA); Janneke House and Frank Kramer, Cambridge Local First; David Downing, City Retail, One Broadway; Charlie Marquardt, 10 Rogers Street; Mark Jaquith, 214 Hurley Street; Minka vanBeuzekom; and Attorney James Rafferty.

Councillor Cheung opened the meeting and stated the purpose. He distributed an agenda (Attachment A). He stated the idea of this meeting stemmed from several conversations with community leaders where it became apparent that outdated zoning was encouraging development and behavior counter to commonly agreed-upon community goals. The purpose of the meeting was to hear from the community on adverse impacts of outdated ordinances they&apos;ve encountered. Future hearings would consider possible remedies. At this time he presented a list of suggestions of outdated current city ordinances to review that are detrimental to community goals that participants previously sent in (Attachment B).

 Suggestion # 1 : Kendall Square is not zoned for restaurants even though people are in agreement that the area would greatly benefit from additional places to socialize and eat out. Nightlife and restaurants are wanted in Kendall Square, but zoning variances are needed and this is a disincentive.

 Suggestion #2 : Frank Kramer informed the committee that Josh Gerber, owner of 1369 Coffeehouse and a Cambridge Local First member, suggested this item requiring Cambridge restaurants/cafs to use recyclable containers and packaging. The 1369 Coffeehouse uses disposable goods and can compost materials. Styrofoam cups, he said, are less expensive but are bad for the environment. Changing one city can have a statewide impact.

 Suggestion # 3 : Charlie Marquardt, 10 Rogers St., suggested item number three, allowing business owners to change the internal structure of the a business (add or remove a wall) without having to apply for special variances. He spoke about the 180 day requirement to get a zoning variance and the need to hire an attorney. He suggested allowing speedy variances that do not affect neighborhoods or use changes. He commented that policymakers put things into place which slow businesses down. This does not make sense.

 Suggestion # 4 : Create incentives for developers to build family units as opposed to one or two bedrooms. This is an idea that came out of the previous Economic Development meeting on the Kendall Square RFP.

 Suggestion # 5 : Allow for business owners, who are not Cambridge residents to apply for parking permits. Renee Farster, President, Inman Square Business Association (ISBA) informed the committee that new business owners who do not live in Cambridge have difficulty finding parking. She asked if it was possible for business owners to have temporary parking permits in residential parking spaces for limited hours during the day.

 Suggestion # 6 : The (ISBA) requested a discussion on the ordinance that allows sale of merchandise in parks and plazas only. Ms. Farster stated that currently items sold in Vellucci Plaza required the permission from the City Council. She stated that she would like the definition broadened. She stated that the city ordinance is outdated, only allowing for the sale of coal and ice. Allowing businesses to sell goods in parks and plazas would facilitate more outdoor sales and business block parties.

 Suggestion # 7&amp;8 : Offered by Terrence Smith, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith read the following prepared statement:

Understanding the impact of City actions that are hurting business growth should begin with an understanding of Cambridge&apos;s role as an economic entity. Cambridge is a regional employment center, a national and international education and cultural center and a global center for innovation. I believe that for Cambridge to continue to serve these rolls regionally, nationally and internationally this is the context that should be used when considering changes to our regulations and policies.

The major ways the City impacts business expansion, retention and attraction are through land use policy and regulation and licensing requirements. Often changes to the zoning ordinance, which is the codification of land-use policies, and regulation have been established with little assessment of the long-term impact of a regulation or a policy. These actions also often have little relation to the expressed goals developed to guide City policies.

The Council establishes goals every two years. The most recent goals focus broadly on providing high levels of service at a reasonable cost to taxpayers while promoting, a healthy environment, housing and doing business in Cambridge. Regulations and regulatory changes should reflect these goals. Providing services requires revenue and the primary source of revenue is the property tax, the primary source of property tax revenue is the commercial sector. Good environmental practice promotes, among other things, the adaptive re-use of existing buildings to their maximum effect, the re-use of previously developed urban land, and massing development to promote efficient use of energy, water, transportation and other resources. The goals for housing and business promotion demonstrate that the Council views preservation and development of both as equally important. Our policies and regulations should reflect these goals.

This and previous City Council&apos;s have shown courage in establishing policies that promote business growth and have positive long-term impacts. The decision by the City Council of the 1970s to establish existing Federal National Institute of Health procedures, procedures that where required for almost all genetic research being done in Cambridge and nationally, as the regulatory framework for life-science research and development in Cambridge coupled with a zoning ordinance and other regulations that allowed entrepreneurs to adaptively re-use existing industrial facilities had the positive result Cambridge being the global center for this industry.

The decision, prompted by the Council, of the License Commission to liberalize its policies on writing new licenses for establishments selling beer and wine and alcohol in a restaurants coupled with relaxed standards for outdoor dining has resulted in new growth in the City&apos;s restaurant industry and new life on our streets.

I cite these two examples, one from more than thirty years ago and one from the last few years to demonstrate that desired outcomes often result from the City doing less rather than doing more.

When this Committee&apos;s Chair Councillor Cheung asked for comments on ordinances that are hurting business growth I offered two that he included in his Jan 13 e-mail. The first is specific to the Zoning Ordinance the second is related to maximizing use of resources in the City and I use parking as an example. These are numbers 7 and 8 in the Jan 13 e-mail.

7) The major regulatory responsibility cities and towns have in Massachusetts is land-use and Cambridge has built a complex and idiosyncratic zoning ordinance over the past forty years in reaction to development proposals or actual developments. As a result half the properties in Cambridge are non-conforming to the zoning ordinance. We have significant capacity remaining in our transportation system, water and sewer, etc. to allow more development but that process is geared to, through the special permit process, large scale development. The small commercial building (in what was once the neighborhood commercial district) in a residential zoned district, the older office building in a historic district, etc. are required to go through the variance process and, in some cases, other regulatory processes for pretty simple changes in use, renovations, etc. This results in under use of commercial space and in some cases redevelopment from commercial to residential use because it is just
easier. The first thing I would like to change is to rewrite our zoning laws so that many fewer parcels are non-conforming.

8) Under current zoning most of the off-street parking in the City is limited in use to the building served by the lot. Now we know that there is a significant grey market in renting excess parking but this is not a smart way to better use those facilities. A clear process should be created that allows a bank, for example, to make its parking available for customers of a neighboring restaurant during evening hours or for a church to make space available (possibly for a fee) outside of the hours of normal services. Several years ago I met an entrepreneur who had developed a system to inexpensively instrument parking spaces and easily allow a property owner to make them available (for a fee) when not needed. Customers would find available parking using a smart phone and either book the space in advance or use on arrival. The major issue with implementing this technology in Cambridge was our regulations. Under-use of existing facilities, be they parking, buildings or of land along
transit corridors is a major detriment to building a greener City. For example, one story buildings around transit centers do not result from good planning and discouraging replacement of such buildings perpetuates poor planning decisions.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.

He further stated that nine of the 14 suggestions have to do with restriction of zoning which is idiosyncratic. He suggested reducing nonconforming parcels first. Changing the use of property, making it housing, is the easiest change.

Councillor Kelly spoke about an empty church parking lot which is vacant six days a week. It makes no sense for this space to be vacant when it could be utilized for economic gain.

Ms. Farster added that the Inman Square Business Association would like to use the Cambridge Health Alliance parking on the weekends.

Mr. Marquardt added that limited permit parking possibilities is an economic disadvantage to business.

Councillor Cheung read suggestions 9 and 10 as follows:

 Suggestion # 9 : Offered by Tim Rowe of the Cambridge Innovation Center, to change the rule mandating architecturally built in drinking water fountains to instead allow businesses to provide a no-cost solution for fresh drinking water to employees.

 Suggestion #10 : Offered by Tim Rowe of the Cambridge Innovation Center, requesting city support for gender neutral bathrooms. Ms. Farster commented that gender neutral bathrooms would be encouraged by her clientele who are largely of the GLBT community.

 Suggestion #11 : Offered by Bob Simha of MIT, to create housing linkage requirement for all institutional and commercial development to encourage more of the students, research workers and other new members of the labor force in Cambridge to have access to affiliated or dedicated housing. Councillor Cheung commented that postgraduates are not provided on-campus housing in adequate numbers and this reduces housing in the neighborhoods.

Suggestions numbered 12, 13, and 14 were offered by James Rafferty as follows:

 Suggestion #12 : Change the definition of fast food. Bakeries and sandwich shops qualify under the current fast food definition. He suggested changing the definition of fast food so as not to discourage sandwich shops. Mr. Rafferty stated that Central Square is the only place where there is a cap on sandwich shops and bakeries but not on banks. Currently the cap in Central Square is fourteen. Councillor Reeves stated that there is a linkage between fast food and trash on the sidewalk. He stated that the fast food definition in the ordinance should be defined by those who work with these establishments. He encouraged more restaurants in Central Square. Mr. Rafferty added that the zoning definition and its meaning have changed with commerce over the years. The definition outlines the percentage of products consumed on the premises. The concept of fast food has change. Panera wanted to come to Central Square but needed a variance. Variances spook businesses and landlords due to the time
frame it takes to secure one.

 Suggestion #13 : Related to areas zoned for residential use. If a low scale retail business leaves such as a dry cleaning business and another low scale business wants to take over the space such as a florist the florist needs to apply for a variance even if they do not change the square footage of floor plan. Could this requirement be altered to make acquiring new business for an abandoned space easier?

 Suggestion #14 : Related to areas zoned for offices - a bank is allowed on the first floor but not a retail shop. This discourages development of restaurants, grocery stores and other neighborhood friendly services. Mr. Rafferty suggested changing the allowed floor uses in office districts. He asked why retail is not allowed in office districts in Kendall Square. He also requested that the parking and loading requirements around businesses be reviewed and be made more flexible.

At 4:55pm Councillor Cheung opened the meeting for public comment.

Janneke House, Executive Director of Cambridge Local First, stated there should be a change in the time frame that businesses are allowed to offer outside dining. New England weather is constantly changing and businesses should be allowed to offer outside seating during the winter months if they deem fit.

Minka vanBeuzekom commented on streamlining the application and payment process. She stated that business owners shouldn&apos;t have to come to City Hall and pay with a check. They should be allowed to pay online with a credit card.

Charlie Marquardt, 10 Rogers St., commented on the city deciding not picking up small business trash. He stated that this decision has created traffic congestion and unnecessary bureaucracy, city trash trucks and private trucks are picking up trash at the same time but the city trucks ignore the small businesses.

At the request of a member of the public Stuart Dash, CDD, read the definition of fast food from the Zoning Ordinance. He commented that the ordinance was created under a context of taking childhood obesity into consideration when thinking about what restaurants you invite into the city. The definition of a fast food restaurant includes that 75% of seating is freestanding tables and that 80% of revenue is consumed off site. Mr. Rafferty stated that he would like the 80% provision reviewed. Mr. Dash responded that all of these suggestions affect multiple agencies and departments. Avenue outdoor seating is being discussed by CDD and trash pickup is an operation of Public Works Department. He stated that the outdoor table use and the office districts changes could be reviewed by CDD.

Estella Johnson, Economic Development Director, CDD stated that the issues discussed during the Committee hearing are covered by multiple departments. She has received complaints from business owners who do not live in Cambridge having difficulty finding parking. Trucks are parking in the street because there are no loading zones. New business incentives like pushcarts and farmers markets are being considered by the Economic Development Department. Streamlining permitting is a big issue she stated.

Mr. Smith added that the Parking Transportation Demand Management (PTDM) ordinance had a sunset clause but the City Council amended the PT DM ordinance to remove it.

At 5:16pm Councillor Cheung requested comments from members of the City Council present.

Councillor Reeves spoke about businesses in Central Square who have difficulty parking and could not park in the Central Square garage. He stated his concern regulating that no alcohol could be served on city streets impacting outdoor dining. He wanted sandwich board signs reviewed; are they attractive or not. Stakeholders he said should be consulted before things are dismantled. An auction house in mid- Cambridge will become a restaurant. He encouraged reviewing outdated ordinances, but cautioned do not fix things that are not broken. It is a fact Cambridge does not have parking for everyone.

Councillor Seidel asked if the question is whether to increase the cap on allowed fast food restaurants or to redefine what fast food means in the 21st century. He asked if variances were denied because of neighborhood concerns. Mr. Rafferty stated his preference is to review the matrix of grandfathered uses. Variances create time issues and only a few could be resolved quickly. An administrative action is a different process. Councillor Seidel questioned Mr. Smith on the issue of nonconformance. Mr. Smith responded that Cambridge was established in 1630 and survived over three-hundred years without a zoning ordinance. He stated that the city&apos;s ordinance process for the last 30 years is a restrictive tool built to keep things out not to bring things in. He urged reviewing nonconforming buildings first.

Vice Mayor Davis commented that gender-neutral issues and water fountains could be fixed now. She spoke about smart growth. She stated that transportation business nodes should be reviewed. She favored a higher-level value concept.

Councillor Cheung thanked all attendees. The suggestions would be voted upon by attendees of the meeting and would determine the specific ordinances to be the subject of the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5:40pm.

For the committee,
Councillor Leland Cheung, Chair
 
 Committee Report #3 
The Economic Development, Training and Employment Committee held a public meeting on Thurs, Dec 16th, 2010, beginning at three o&apos;clock and five minutes P.M. at Cahners Theater, 2nd floor, Museum of Science, 1 Science Park, Boston.

The video of the full meeting can be viewed online here:
 http://www.cambridgema.gov/2010Dec16Cambridge-BostonJointHearingonClusters.wmv 

The purpose of the meeting was to hear from locally-based, world-renowned economic experts on the theories behind economic clusters, and specifically how the cities of Cambridge and Boston can work together to attract new businesses to the region, create jobs, and keep the businesses we have.

Present at the meeting were Councillor Leland Cheung, Chair of the Committee; Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves; Councillor E. Denise Simmons; Councillor Sam Seidel; Mayor David Maher; Robert Healy, City Manager; Richard Rossi, Deputy City Manager; Susan Glazer, Acting Assistant City Manager for Community Development (CDD); Estella Johnson, Economic Development Director, CDD; Lee Gianetti, Chief of Staff, Office of the Mayor; Elizabeth Bedell; Jason Alves; Boston City Councillors: Stephen Murphy, Councillor Bill Linehan , Councillor Matt O&apos;Malley and Councillor Ayanna Presley, and Councillor Mike Ross; Mitch Weiss, Chief of Staff for Mayor Menino; Brenda Mckenzie, the Director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority; Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Economic Development Greg Bialecki; and Phil Budden, British Consulate-General.

Also present were Joe Tulimieri, Cambridge Redevelopment Authority; Sarah Gallop, Co-Director, Government and Community Relations, MIT; Bob Simha, MIT Professor; Paul Parravano, MIT; John McQuaid, MIT; Steve Marsh and Michael Owu, MITIMco; Joe Maguire, Alexandria Real Estate; Tim Rowe, President, CEO, Cambridge Innovation Center; Brian Dacey, Senior Vice President and Regional Partner, Twining Properties; Janneke House, Executive Director, Cambridge Local First; Jos Scheffelaar, CEO and Founder, Launch in US Alliance; Gus Weber, Microsoft; Nan Doyle, Principal, Trillium; Marc Levy, Editor, Cambridge Day; Terrence Smith, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce; Travis McCready, Kendall Square Association; Tom Lucey, Director of Community Relations, Harvard University; Mike Cantalupa, Boston Properties; Geoff Mamlet, Cambridge Innovation Center; Jeff Lockwood, Novartis; Mathew Campion, Office of the British Consulate-General; Rich Bryden, Harvard Business School; Colleen Powell, Massachusetts
Convention Center Authority; D.C. Denison, Boston Globe; Richard Dimino, A Better City; Jim Collins, New England Business Partners; Richard Parr, A Better City; Bill Ghormley, Xconomy; Kelly Thompson Clark, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce; Davis Dyer, Monitor Group; Kurt Dassel, Monitor Group; Gregg Nourjian, Partner, Spinnaker Venture Partners; Melissa Walsh, Massachusetts Life Sciences Center; Pascal Marmier, Swissnex; Eric Schoenfeld, Independent Consultant; Peter Carty, Genzyme; Robert Beal, Beal Co.; Dale Blank, Biotechnology Consultant; Joan Bennett, Cambridge Health Alliance; Costas Boussios, Betahat Optimal; Kelly Courtney, Pipeline Management; Jim Rooney, Massachusetts High Tech Council; Minka van Buezekom; Nathan Rothstein, Swellr; Audrey Guazzone, YEI France; Brian Nanos, Cambridge Chronicle; Tim Stoll, Biomed Realty; Meghan Haggerty, Boston Municipal Research Bureau; Brian Morgan, Boston World Partnership; Amir Eldad, Boston World Partnership; Paula Mesasein, Boston World
Partnership; Darnley Howard, Independent Consultant; Bill Kane, Biomet; and Ioannis Miaoulis, President, Museum of Science.

Councillor Cheung opened the meeting and stated the purpose as being to hear from experts on economic development and to kick start a dialogue on the potential areas of common interest where Cambridge and Boston could collaborate instead of compete to better create jobs and opportunity for their respective residents.

Councillor Cheung introduced his colleagues. He acknowledged Mayor Maher and applauded his efforts this term in fighting for education reform. He acknowledged Councillor Denise Simmons and applauded her for her previous attempts to reach across the river and work with Boston on other issues. Councillor Cheung acknowledged that many people were worried that this meeting was purely political in purpose. He said that although it felt like a political event because so many politicians were in the room, the purpose was actually to try and put politics aside. We&apos;re there to try and solve a problem that is inherently political. When businesses are shopping around for a location, they think of Boston and Cambridge as one region, not as separate from one another. Councillor Cheung argued that if Cambridge and Boston work together, the region will benefit as a whole. The Cambridge-Boston region has many resources: the best schools in the country, a highly educated and a motivated populace,
and fantastic opportunities for progress. Councillor Cheung stated that with all we have, we should be leading the nation in bootstrapping ourselves out of the current recession.

Councillor Cheung then invited Boston City Council President, Mike Ross to address the crowd. Councillor Ross thanked his colleagues, Councillor Stephen Murphy, Councillor Bill Linehan, Councillor Matt O&apos;Malley and Councillor Ayanna Presley for attending the meeting. He stated he was really excited about the prospect of Boston and Cambridge working together. He said that our region is the most economically competitive region in the country but more needs to be done to keep jobs and college students here. Silicon Valley is not one city, it is a collaboration of 22 cities and they do not have the resources that we do here in Massachusetts. We are the most culturally and intellectually endowed region in the United States. Other regions have to try harder because they do not have our resources, but we still need to up our game. Councillor Mike Ross stated that we cannot be lulled into complacency. This meeting is not a symbolic exercise, it is not merely rhetoric but it will be used as
a launching pad for future discussions.

Councillor Mike Ross introduced Museum of Science President Ioannis Miaoulis. President Miaoulis thanked the attendees. He argued that there was no better place than Cahner&apos;s Auditorium to hold such a meeting because it is the only room to be located both in Cambridge and in Boston. He stated that the Museum of Science is the most attended cultural institution in New England and that it is the second most attended federal science center in the country after the Smithsonian Air&amp;Space Museum. The Museum of Science also supplies 1.8 million American students with text books each year.

Councillor Leland Cheung introduced Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Economic Development, Greg Bialecki. Secretary Bialecki thanked the crowd on behalf of Governor Patrick. He stated that he deeply believes that bolstering economic development is tremendously easier when local governments are working in a partnership with the state. It is a simple truth that Boston will be better and stronger if it works with Cambridge and Cambridge will be better and stronger if it works with Boston. The desirability of both locations is bolstered by cooperation between city administrations.

Councillor Mike Ross introduced Chief of Staff for Mayor Menino, Mitch Weiss, and the Director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Brenda McKenzie. Mitch Weiss stated that 360 days ago Mayor Menino said in his inaugural address that we need to develop an innovation cluster. Mayor Menino learned from the financial crisis that we need to get back to engineering, instead of financial engineering. Cambridge and Boston need to literally build our way to a better economy. We come together at a very important time, China is on pace to build ten cities the size of New York City over the next 20 years. The region has all the resources needed to be competitive; we just need to focus our approach. Cambridge and Boston can collaborate on affordable housing. Mitch Weiss stated that although collaboration is good, we still need a healthy dose of competition.

Brenda McKenzie addressed the crowd. She stated that this event was special because it allows for government officials to speak directly to the stakeholders. The big picture needs to be seen. Boston-Cambridge is competing against the world.

Councillor Cheung introduced Rich Bryden, Director of Information Products at Harvard&apos;s Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness Presentation. Rich Bryden works with Michael Porter at the Harvard Business School. His presentation can be viewed at http://www.isc.hbs.edu/pdf/Boston-Cambridge_Councils_RichBryden_2010-1216.pdf

Rich Bryden stated that although Cambridge-Boston is doing relatively well, there are many warning signs that point to the need for increased collaboration. His intention is to provide a framework of why developing regional clusters is vital to a strong economy. Micro and Macroeconomic factors impact the development of a regional cluster. Microeconomic factors include the quality of the business environment, the state of cluster development and the sophistication of individual company strategies. Macroeconomic factors include the resources endowed by a certain geographic area and access to the market, a state&apos;s legal system and monetary policy. A Cluster is a geographic concentration of related companies and associated institutions such as hospitals and universities. Individual companies tend to perform far better if they are part of a regional cluster than if left alone in isolation. For example, the Life Sciences cluster we have in Boston is nurtured by our hospitals and research
universities and responds to the specialized needs of these institutions. It is also nurtured by the specialized risk capital investment companies that have sprung up in the area. Boston&apos;s most notable clusters are financial services, analytical instruments, information technology and biotechnology. All of these clusters are strong but we are losing ground and are underperforming compared to upstart regions such as Dallas, Texas region and North Carolina. Regional Clusters provide a powerful model for enacting public policy. They allow for public-private collaboration.

Councillor Mike Ross introduced Davis Dyer and Kurt Dassel of the Monitor Group. Davis Dyer presented on how to implement cluster theory. ::Attachment 1::

Davis Dyer stated that business growth does not solely depend on how smart and great individual companies are but also what environment they are operating in.

For example, there is nothing that can explain why Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas has become a center for cluster development, but its economy is growing at a much faster speed than the rest of the nation. The reason why Dallas is growing is because the cities and townships have banded together around the new airport. They have unified their city administrations. Together they actively courted leading institutions to the region, so much so that Dallas has become the number one place in the country for corporate relocation. In order to replicate the Texas model, we need strong and committed leadership, a shared vision and an organized set of priorities.

Councillor Cheung introduced Rich Dimino, President and CEO of A Better City.

Rich Dimino presented on the importance of developing transportation infrastructure in a cluster. Massachusetts has the sixth worst commute time in the nation. ::Attachment 2::

Rich Dimino stated that we need to better connect Boston and Cambridge. Transportation systems bolster and support growth and development. Connectivity is crucial to the maintenance of a cluster. People want to move around a cluster - Kendall to Boston Medical, Novartis to the Longwood Medical Center. Logan is also crucial and needs to be fully sustained. Furthermore, Massachusetts is doing a great job at getting private investment and federal grants but needs to start investing this money into its transportation systems.

Councillor Mike Ross introduced Kurt Dassel of the Monitor Group. Kurt Dassel raised a puzzle: Why is it that we have world class assets but despite this we are losing our competitive position? He stated that economic development is ultimately getting a company to choose this region instead of another region. Companies chose a region when it is differentiated from the competition. Our universities and hospitals attract world class talent but since 1998 companies have tended not to gravitate in the same numbers to Boston-Cambridge. We need to figure out a way to address this and this meeting is a crucial first step in tackling this issue.

This concluded the portion of the meeting of presenters using overhead projection of slides and data on the theories and applications of economic clusters, and began the portion of community leaders speaking on behalf of the involved organizations they represent.

Councillor Leland Cheung introduced the Executive Director of Boston World Partnerships, Yoon Lee, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Convention Authority Colleen Richards Powell, Executive Director of the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce Kelly Clark Thompson and Executive Vice President of the Boston Chamber of Commerce Jim Klocke.

Yoon Lee stated that Boston World Partnerships was founded by Mayor Menino to promote Boston&apos;s great assets. The purpose of Boston World Partnerships to act as a super connector for human infrastructure.

Colleen Richards Powell stated that her job is to sell Boston-Cambridge to the outside world. She never separates the two when talking about what the region has to offer.

Kelly Clark Thompson stated that the region should be marketed as a whole to outside businesses.

Jim Klocke stated that this decade has been much harder to Boston than the last. We are falling behind because it is too expensive to start a business here due to high taxes and start-up costs.

Councillor Mike Ross introduced Executive Director of the Kendall Square Association, Travis McCready, Executive Director of the Mass Life Sciences Center, Melissa Walsh, Peter Abair of the Massachusetts Bio Tech Council and Jim Rooney of the Mass High Tech Council.

Travis McCready stated that Kendall Square is the most innovative square mile on the planet. Tech companies crave collaboration, collaboration craves density. Boston and Cambridge need to collaborate on STEM education. We should be home growing our talent rather than resorting to recruiting it.

Melissa Walsh talked about the services that Mass Life Sciences offers to Massachusetts residents and students. They offer a paid internship program that matches students with biotech and life sciences companies in the region.

Peter Abair stated that the Mass Biotech Council represents over 600 members. He said when interested businesses come to visit in Kendall Square he is able to point to 5 out of the 7 top NIH funded hospitals in the country and four of the top research universities from his window.

Jim Rooney recommends that the two cities promote the creation of a consortium of colleges and universities in the region. Springfield has the Knowledge Corridor. The cluster would greatly benefit if universities worked in collaboration with each other.

Councillor Leland Cheung introduced Dr. Phil Budden, the British Consulate-General. Phil Budden stated that Great Britain has a stake in our cluster. He stated that many British companies are based here including Shire, AstraZenica and Citizen&apos;s Bank. The whole world has faced an economic downturn. Future jobs will come out of Michael Porter&apos;s model for regional clusters. The region is a mature cluster, Cambridge-Boston implemented Porter argument long before anyone else, but now the rest of the world is catching up.

Councillor Mike Ross opened the meeting to Public Comment. He asked attendees to speak on what challenges the region faces and offer suggestions on how the two cities work better together.

Paul Parravano of MIT stated that this meeting was an important first step. He also announced MIT&apos;s new project PIE that will focus on creating manufacturing jobs for the state.

Robert Beal of Beal Co. stated the most important thing to focus on is how to keep our students here. There is a need to create more affordable housing.

Tim Rowe of the Cambridge Innovation Center stated that Boston and Cambridge have a long history of collaboration. The very first long distance phone call was placed from Beacon Hill to what is now MIT&apos;s campus. He stated that when he travels oversees he tells people he is from Boston. We need to be able to tell our story better and pitch the region as a whole.

Jeff Lockwood stated Novartis came here because the region had so much to offer. Novartis routinely works with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Mass General Hospital and MIT. Collaboration is key for companies to flourish.

Estella Johnson of Cambridge&apos;s Economic Development Department stated that she came from the South and knows what the region is up against. Cambridge cannot take for granted that the region will continue to thrive. Other clusters, such as Raleigh, North Carolina should be researched.

Gus Weber of Microsoft stated Microsoft came here to tap into our huge talent pool. They currently employ over 1,000 people.

Jeff Taylor of Monster.com stated the cities need to appreciate and celebrate small companies and give them a platform.

Councillor Mike Ross ended public comment. He concluded by thanking the attendees for coming. He stated that he believes that this meeting conveyed the fierce urgency of the need for more collaboration. He stated that the job of government officials is to facilitate and continue these discussions.

Councillor Cheung gave his closing statements. He stated that it is vitally important for Cambridge and Boston to work together to bring jobs to the region and keep the economy competitive. We cannot let political battles get in the way of doing what&apos;s necessary to create opportunity for residents and make their lives better. He thanked the attendees for participating.

The meeting adjourned at five o&apos;clock and fifteen minutes PM.
