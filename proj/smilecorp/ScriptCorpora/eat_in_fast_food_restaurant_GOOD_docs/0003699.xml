 How To Stay Motivated During a Training Program 
 Set a Reasonable Goal: The first step to any training/diet program is to set a goal for yourself. Say you want to lose 30 pounds. Your goal could be to lose a pound a week by reducing calories by 500 a day. Remember that weight loss is not always linear so some weeks you may lose more and some weeks you may lose less. Don’t expect to lose more than 1 to 2 pounds a week consistently unless you are obese. It will be difficult to maintain that rate of weight loss. 
 
 Build a Support Group: Tell your family members and close friends about your new program and ask them to support you. You could also join websites and subscribe to fitness blogs to stay motivated and communicate with others who have the same goals as you.  
 
Picture Your Goal, Literally: If you don’t live alone, chances are you have foods in the fridge that you’re not supposed to be eating on your new diet or exercise plan. It’s really tempting to open the fridge and grab a pudding cup instead of a bag of broccoli. Find an inspirational person whose body you admire and put their picture on your fridge. This serves as a reminder telling you not to cheat if you truly want to look like your goal.  
 
Reward Yourself Sticking to a routine can get boring and make you want to drive to the nearest fast food restaurant to grab something that could undo your whole week of hard work and dedication. To avoid those moments of weakness, reward yourself once in a while. Eat something you would not normally eat once a week but fit it into your daily calorie intake. Lean cuisine meals are a good choice for just such occasions. If that doesn’t do it for you, check out the nutritional info at your favorite restaurant and pick something that will not cause too much damage!  
 
Lose The Excuses Nobody said this was going to be easy. If it was, everyone would be doing it and looking like a superstar. So stop making excuses. No one can stop you from sticking to your program but you. So lose the excuses and get with the program! 
 
 Get To The Gym The hardest part of working out is getting to the gym. If you can get there, the rest is easy. How many times have you decided not to go to the gym but dragged yourself there and felt so good afterwards that you said to yourself,“I’m glad I did this”? Enough said. 
Track Your Progress Weigh yourself first thing in the morning but only once a week on the same day. Don’t obsess over your scale weight. Sometimes going by the mirror and how your clothes fit are better ways to track your progress, especially if you’re on a lifting program where you could be gaining muscle and losing fat.  
 
 Pick a Deadline: It’s good to have a goal and a deadline at the same time. Sometimes we work better knowing we don’t have all the time in the world to achieve what we want to achieve. For example, if your goal is to lose 30 pounds but you don’t have a deadline, you’re more likely to cheat knowing you have more time to lose the 30lbs and you’re less likely to stick to your diet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Spring and Summer Fashion Dos and Don’ts 
 There are many hot trends to follow this season and finding the right one is a challenge! Here are some dos and don’ts that will help you look fabulous this Spring and Summer. 
 
 Do Pair Bright Colors with Black 
 The easiest way to deal with the bright hues this Spring is to go vibrant on top and dark on the bottom. Pick the colors that flatter your skin tones best. Jewled tones such as bright reds, pinks, purples, greens and blues match all skin tones while lodens and mustards are a bit trickier.  
   
 Don’t Spoil the Mystery 
 Showing off bare skin is hot but showing off too much skin is definitely not. Wearing overly tight clothes or exposing too much skin leaves no room for imagination. Stay classy; if your skirt or dress is too short go for a more conservative top or If your skirt/dress is longer, go for a sleeveless top.  
   
 Do Pair Opposites 
 Opposites work wonders. If your top is form fitting go with a more flowy skirt and if your skirt if form fitting try a loose blouse/top. This does not mean the form fitting top and bottom, and the loose top and bottom don’t work together but if you want to put a modern twist on your outfit then go with a change in proportion. Picture a drop waist dress that is loose on top and tight on the bottom. If you want to look slimmer, avoid the flowy top and bottom look; it will make you look heavy. 
 
   Don’t Overload on Embellishment 
 Always pair trendy pieces with more simple pieces in order to make them stand out. A really cool and colorful necklace will make a bigger statement when worn with a simple T-shirt dress or V-neck top as opposed to a busy blouse or printed dress. Too much detail is outdated and will look too heavy.  
   
 Do mix Cobalt Blue into your closet 
 This beautiful and vibrant blue is all over the runway and matches all skin tones. Wear it with white for a more classic look or match it with pastels like lilac and lemon yellow for a more emphatic statement. If you want a bolder and more daring look try wearing it with turquoise. 
   
 Don’t forget to Accessorize 
 Accessories are a great part of your outfit but don’t overdo it. Golden pendants are big this season. Wear them with a long gold chain or you can layer them with your other gold necklaces to create your own look. Long sleek shoulder dusters and gold/silver plated Victorain Cameos were seen all over Hollywood and can transform your simple outfit into runway chic. Leather cuffs and bracelets are also hot items this season and will take your outfit from boring to fabulous.  
 
 
 Your Face: The Perfect Canvas 
 
 If you’re an artist you know to always prep your canvas before adding colors to the painting. Putting make up on starts with applying concealer, foundation, powder and whatever else you need to prep your canvas so choose them wisely. Here are a few tips on what to look for when you shop for new products. 
 
 Tinted Moisturizer: 
 When searching for that everyday, dewy, not too heavy not too light coverage, Laura Mercier Tinted moisturizer is your best friend. It goes on smoothly and gives you radiant flawless coverage that lasts all day. It also contains SPF 20 and comes in a regular and oil-free formula for every skin type.  


 
 Under eye Concealer: 
 Eye creams promise to diminish under eye circles but rarely deliver. Most of these creams contain Vitamin K which helps but does not completely solve the problem. Dark circles are genetic and the most effective way to get rid of them is to hide them with concealer. Here are some of the best concealers to help cover dark circles. YSL Touche Eclat has a peachy color and light reflecting particles to help cover the darkest shadows. Boi-ing by Benefit Cosmetics is another great product that can be used all over the face as well as under the eyes.  


 
 Medicated Concealer: 
 Covering acne is not easy especially if it takes forever to heal. The best way to get rid of acne is to treat it so you don’t have to wait until you wash off your make up to address the acne. There are acne treatment concealers out there to treat and cover the pimples at the same time without over drying your skin. Murad Acne Treatment Concealer is one of the best ones out there; It’s a combination of 2.0% Salicylic acid and green tea which zap zits and limits oil production to prevent future breakouts.  


 
 Foundation: 
 If you’re looking for a full coverage foundation that lasts though a whole night of dancing or a full day of outing, pick up a bottle of Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk. This formula covers blotches and skin imperfections without looking cakey and overly done, no matter how many layers you’ve put on. This foundation is chosen by most Hollywood make up artists and stars such as Kate Hudson!  


 
 Powder: 
 Depending on the kind of coverage you’re looking for in a powder, (Light, Medium, Full) there are a lot of great options out there. If you’re oily in the T-zone, you want to stick with a matifying powder that has light-med coverage and stays put. Full coverage powders are often too thick and can look cakey. One of the best Matifying powders (with medium coverage) that gives you the best bang for your buck is the Sephora brand. It’s silky texture goes on smooth and stays put for several hours. 

 
 
 Now you’re ready to paint but be sure not to over do it. You want to be complimented on how pretty YOU look not how pretty your make up looks 
 Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Cupcakes 
 With summer right around the corner, everyone is slimming down and shedding fat to look their best in colorful bikinis and summer outfits. Working out is a good way to shed those pounds but a healthy and nutritious diet with the right amount of calories is the real key to fat loss success. It’s hard to stay on track with strict diets since we’re human and crave sweet things like cupcakes but one must be strong and resist those craving unless they can be substituted with something delicious like a protein cupcake which takes seconds to make and is guilt free!  
 
 Here’s a recipe for a delicious chocolate peanut butter protein cupcake 
   
 Mix one scoop of whey protein with a dash of baking powder and 1/8 cup of hot water in a microwavable cupcake bowl. Any Whey protein should work for this recipe but my favorite is Designer Triple Whey protein from Max Muscle in the chocolate ice-cream flavor. Add a table spoon of natural peanut butter or Almond butter if you’re allergic to peanuts. Make sure it’s blended well.  
 
 Put the bowl in the microwave for 25 seconds and take the bowl out carefully. Use 2-3 table spoons of sugar free jello chocolate/vanilla pudding snack as your cupcake frosting since it’s very low in calories. Get the cupcake out of the bowl, pour your frosting on top and viola! You’ve got a yummy cupcake without all the fat and sugar and plenty of protein power. You can also make this cupcake without the peanut butter if you prefer.  
   
 Here is the nutritional info for one cupcake: 
 Calories - 255 
 Protein - 31g 
 Carbohydrates - 14g 
 Fat - 9.5g 
 Sugar - 0g 
 
 Enjoy your sugar free snack! You can use this cupcake as a meal replacement for when you’re on the run or enjoy it with a cup of coffee or black tea as an afternoon snack. Newer Posts Older Posts Home
