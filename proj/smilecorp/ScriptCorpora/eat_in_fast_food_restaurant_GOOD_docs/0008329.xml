IN FLATWARE, VENDORS SHOW THEIR METAL.

NEW YORK-Manufacturers are taking a variety of approaches to the
flatware business during this week&apos;s Fall Tabletop Show. Some are
expanding popular flatware lines into multipiece sets or other
categories of business, such as photo frames or serveware. Others are
pairing popular dinnerware patterns with complementary flatware. Most
have pared down their introductions to highlight a few patterns, rather
than a slew of new items. The enormous popularity of brushed finishes
has quieted a little; while they remain in demand, many of the flatware
introductions here have a mirror finish. Design runs toward the
traditional. Following is a summary of what can be seen in flatware and
metals at this market.

Buccellati

Based on the success of the spring introduction of its Villa
Palladio collection of sterling-silver giftware, Buccellati introduces
six additional items. New this fall are three-light and five-light
candelabras in the lighting category; a new vase, cookie tray and footed
centerpiece to round out the home living category; and the imposing
Napoleon vase as a statement piece.

Christofle

New Art Deco-inspired flatware from Christofle is called Commodore,
now reissued in sterling silver. Its contemporary styling includes
structured contours and fluid lines circled by rings. Puzzle table
accessories in sterling are a fun take on a child&apos;s game: When
assembled, four puzzle pieces make up a placemat; separated, they become
coasters. The Martele multipicture frame in hammered silver has the look
of tiny raindrops. There is also the reissued Como tea service, a
marriage of sterling silver and raffia raffia   (răf`ēə)  or raphia   (rā`fēə) , fiber obtained from the raffia palm of Madagascar, exported for various uses, such as tying up plants that require support, binding together vegetables  in a contemporary shape. This
limited edition includes five pieces, a sugar bowl, creamer, coffee pot A coffee pot is a kitchen implement; a cooking pot in the kettle family. A coffee pot is also a container to hold freshly brewed coffee. There are many types and styles. ,
tea pot and tray with handles.

for Christofle that melds crystal and silver, called Collection 3000.
