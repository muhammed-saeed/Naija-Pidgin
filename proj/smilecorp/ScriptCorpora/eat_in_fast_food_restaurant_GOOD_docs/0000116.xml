Use tweezers to carefully pull out the paper and replace it with your own quotes. Put the fortune cookie back in the bag and tape it shut. It will be a wonderful surprise when your love sees what you wrote!

Buy a bag of pretzels and bite them off to form letters (or use alphabet shaped pretzels) and glue the letters on paper. Surprise each other with phrases like &quot;I love you&quot; or &quot;You are special to me&quot;. The result is lots of fun, exchange of sweet comments, built in snacking, and a finished product from your significant other that you can treasure forever.

Prepare him a meal in your house or in his house. Preferably somewhere you are both going to be alone. Make a menu of what is going to be served. Write a title that says &quot;welcome to passions restaurant&quot;. You should be dressed with a very sexy lingerie and heels. While doing the menu instead of entering prices for the food, you must enter 5 Kisses or Foreplay or massage and so on. For each thing served he has to give tou what the price is. Treat him like a king and then you&apos;ll get your share too. (La Tipasa)

Prepare a dinner with multiple courses. Take your love to a street that&apos;s rather busy and make sure you both dress in best. Set up a folding table, and chairs and pull out candles. Treat her with old fashioned courtesy. Have friends drive by and become a waiter for the moment-each friend bringing a different coarse- pay no attention to the funny looks, honks, etc.
