I grew up eating Kewpee Hamburgers and whenever I make it home I always stop by the downtown location. Walking into this one is like going thru a time machine.

I normally get the double with cheese, relish, and mustard and get a malt ,that is still served in a glass, to wash it down. I&apos;ve had the fish sandwich once and it&apos;s not the normal square fish, it&apos;s a real filet.

Although there are three locations in the Lima Area--East, West&amp;Downtown--I recommend visiting the downtown locale, which is a holdover from a bygone era. The other two feel like they were designed more to ward off potential visitors than invite and accommodate.

The Food:

The burgers are delicious as far as fast food burgers go, the best I&apos;ve ever tasted. Though I recommend the double, as the single will leave you wanting more.

The fries are good, similar to Wendy&apos;s. PLUS you can order them HOT at the downtown location. Just be sure to say &quot;hot fry&quot; and they will drop a batch just for you.

The Kewpee frosty is a real treat, especially downtown, where they serve it in a tall sundae glass--and still serve coffee in a mug.

Pumpkin, Cherry and Chocolate pies are also quite good as well, although seasonal.

Be sure to check out the men&apos;s restroom (downtown), which is actually located in a nook, outside, in the back of the establishment.

Moreover, most of the workers there are lifers, which means it&apos;s real easy to become a regular. I don&apos;t know about any of you, but I consider becoming a regular at any joint a major accomplishment in life.

Kewpee is the quintessential classic fast-food restaurant.  I would be surprised to find some that grew up in Lima that *didn&apos;t* visit Kewpee at least once. Stepping though the door is a bit like stepping back in time.

The food is prepared fresh to order, with locally obtained fresh ingredients. The beef is ground and pattied on the premises, and prepared on a classic open griddle.  The top notch ingredients and good old-fashioned preparation techniques make for a burger taste experience that can&apos;t be topped by any of the big &apos;modern&apos; chains.

My personal favorite is a loaded double cheeseburger special  plus olives, with fries and a malt. Dipping your fries in your malt is highly  recommended by this reviewer.

If the burgers, fries and malts don&apos;t fill you up, then just ask for a piece of pie! Heck, order a whole pie to go and enjoy it later!

NOTE: Unlike the two suburban Lima locations, the downtown Kewpee also offers their large malts in a classic frozen malt glass - be sure to ask for it if you&apos;re dining in.

Take the kids, they will enjoy the experience as well as the food.  At least five generations of my family has eaten at the Kewpee, and I wholly expect the pattern to continue so long as the restaurant remains.

Back to Kewpie&apos;s!  I headed here as soon as I pulled into Lima, town of my birth, even before I found a motel.  It&apos;s been four years so I was looking forward to it.  I&apos;m not sure if this is a great section of town to be in at night, but I wasn&apos;t going to let that stop me from enjoying the experience!

I ordered the usual, Cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate malt, but alas, they were out of my favorite, the sugar cream pie.  :&apos;(

The food was as I expected except the malt didn&apos;t have a very pronounced malt flavor.  I substituted mincemeat pie for dessert and it was very good for a fast food restaurant.  I&apos;m always amazed at how good the pie crusts are in the Midwest, wherever I go.  Why can&apos;t they get that right in San Diego??

Thanks Kewpies!  I&apos;ll see you next trip!

Drove through this place while taking a tour of the Midwest.   Walking into this place was a step back in the past.  The staff was super friendly and courteous.  The food was delicious!  We ordered the cheeseburger and fries.  At the end of our meal we wanted the staff to take a photo with us, and they glady obliged.  Thanks for a wonderful experience.

I grew up on Kewpee and always have enjoyed visiting this downtown location. In fact this is the only location that I will visit, and some of the staff that works there have been there since I was a kid, so it is a real treat to feel a sense of familiarity when I visit.  I usually get the special on wheat bread (regular bread sometimes it sooo sweet...), fries, malt, and strawberry rhubarb pie... deelish!

This is a classic joint that the whole family will love.. There is a sign on their wall that states &quot;your grandpappy ate here&quot; I am happy to say my papa still does! LOL During lunch and dinner this place is busy, but i have to say they have never lost their touch.

I would like to give a special thanks to the morning staff! Last time I was home I told them I was taking some home to my husband and the staff politely packed my order up so that I could assemble it when I got home, this would prevent it from being soggy on the 4 hour trip back to Chicago.. Thanks so much! My husband and I enjoyed every bite, and I will be back real soon! ( I wish there was one in Chicago, hint hint)

Word amongst the hamburger cognoscenti is that Kewpee Hamburgers were the inspiration for Dave Thomas (RIP) to found Wendy&apos;s (which, arguably has one of the better national chain offerings).

I grew up savoring Kewpees (and their unique parking lot car turntable!) but  had no idea of their widespread (evidently: world-wide!) status until I stumbled upon a photo essay on Kewpees in an art gallery in Germany.

Their global glory is justified...Kewpee is a great, traditonal hamburger.

Whenever I&apos;ve returned to the Buckeye State, I&apos;ve made visiting Kewpee&apos;s a must for me and my companions.  And, although they neither grew up with my awareness nor affinity for Kewpees, they all became instant converts.

Go visit Kewpee Hamburgers; prepare yourself for a happy conversion.

I decided to eat here for lunch as I was driving through Lima on my way to Sturgis, MI. The drive-thru was so long that it ended up taking up a lane on the street, and so I parked in the parking lot outside. Unfortunately, it was raining outside, and I had to call the restaurant to ask where the front entrance was.

When I walked up to the counter to order, I was greeted by four friendly middle-aged women. One of them asked where I was from, and another asked me if I played piano (I have pretty long fingers).

1. Double cheeseburger, $3.50
Make sure you specifically ask for what you want on it. Otherwise she&apos;ll just give you buns, patty, and cheese. If you get everything on it except olives and with bacon added, it&apos;s a pretty good burger, almost comparable to In N Out.

2. Chocolate malt, $3.25
Mediocre. Basically just chocolate ice cream.

3. Fries, $1.45
Mediocre, but I had them cold.

Also, you have to go outside to get to the men&apos;s restroom, which sucks. Ladies have it nice and get one inside.

If there was only one thing that pretty much anyone from Lima can agree upon, it is how proud we are of Kewpee.  TO anybody who comes from out of town, they may think the place looks like a dump.  And quite frankly, it does in fact look that way, but once you bite into that burger for the first time, you forget all about the decor.

I don&apos;t need a fancy setting to enjoy a good burger.  The meat is fresh,never frozen and comes from a local producer.

If there was one complaint I had, they fixed it, the drinks.  You always got ripped off by the glass filled to the brim with ice.  But no more.  You can get a large drink for only a dollar!!

A true gem to our town!

I have always had that feeling that Dave secretly stumbled upon Kewpee and then ran with it.  He did pretty darn well, but for the best you obviously have to go to the original.  Kewpee reminds me a bit of In-N-Out Burger in Cali.  Everything is made fresh right when you order it. The frosty&apos;s, as Wendy call them, are amazing.  It&apos;s the perfect compliment to your french fries!

I can&apos;t wait to visit Kewpee again very soon...

The downtown Kewpee Hamburgers is a real classic. Loved the vintage diner architecture and the friendly staff.
Someone who knew I was heading down towards Lima told me I *needed* to visit Kewpee for a burger.
Now, I believed I never had a Kewpee burger in the past, but the name rang a bell with me. So I began poking around online and...viola! Kewpee burgers and my beloved Halo Burgers in Flint, Michigan are historically one and the same! In fact, I&apos;d reviewed Halo here on Yelp and blogged about it in the past as well at http://www.midwestguest.… 
So, how did the Lima version stack up? Same great taste...and the same ability to add sliced olives to my burger. And I do loves me my olive burgers!
Fries and frozen lemonade were the perfect accompaniments to my lunch.
We managed to hit this place about mid-afternoon, so we were able to park quite close by.
I found the campy Kewpee babies fun, rather than creepy, and ended up taking tons of photos of the place, too. I&apos;m feeling another blog post coming on f&apos;sure...

Oh my gosh...I miss Kewpee! I grew up in Waynesfield Ohio about 15-20 miles outside of Lima Ohio where there are 3 Kewpee locations. Great burgers, shakes, and fresh baked pies at an affordable price. Great memories going to Kewpee with the family when I was a kid and then with friends as a teenager as it was one of the few places we could afford to go! Interiors are basic and remind you of the West Coast In and Out Burger chain, burgers are square, they have chili, and shakes are thick and very similar to Wendy&apos;s but sooo much better in my opinion. I live in California now and the nearest Kewpee is 3000 miles away, so sad.

This location offers their shakes in footed glasses. Rumor is they taste better that way. It&apos;s much smaller than the other Kewpees.

I grew up with Kewpee and the local legends of Dave Thomas&apos; dastardly concept theft. Whenever I&apos;ve taken non-local friends there, they were always a bit creeped out by the giant naked baby dolls that serve as the institution&apos;s sole decoration. My norms be shifted as I never noticed. I also mentally refer to the year&apos;s second and third months as Februcherry and Marchocolate on account of Kewpee. All in all, I miss their hamburgers daily and it&apos;s definitely worth the time to stop in Lima if you&apos;re passing through.

I have been going here since I was little and I still have a taste for it now and then.  I don&apos;t have one near me but sometimes when I am down that way I HAVE to stop and get a burger and fries.  They are always perfect and it is one of the best burgers I have ever tasted.
