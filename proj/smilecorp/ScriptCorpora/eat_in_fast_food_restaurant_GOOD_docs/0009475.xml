 ButterflyDancer 09-14-2004, 04:28 AM Does anyone here live in the FCI Butner area? Am looking for info about where to stay, etc. Also any ideas on the best way to get there from northeast Tennessee?

Have tried Federal forum with one response from someone who was inside Butner himself. Nice info for my husband but not exactly what I need.

Any and all info will be appreciated.

WJ557 nomatterwhat 09-14-2004, 07:48 AM I&apos;ve been to Butner many times (I had friends who lived there), and I don&apos;t recall any places to stay, but then, I wasn&apos;t looking for that either, since I&apos;m in NC to begin with. It&apos;s a very small town, and the prisons and other state run facilities are the main employers there.

I would try www.expedia.com (http://www.expedia.com/) and click on driving directions, but you probably already know that.

I am only about 45 minutes away from NE Teneesee and if I was going to Butner from, say, Elizabethton, Johnson City, or Mountain City, I&apos;d take 421 to Boone, 321 to Hickory, and 40 to Butner. It seems the straightest shot to me, but I&apos;m no traveling whiz. Expedia might say to take 421 to meet up somewhere close to 40, but really, I&apos;ve done it both ways and 421-321-40 is about the same amount of time, but easier driving.

There is a good little diner somewhere across the road from the Post Office in Butner (sort of in a strip with other stores, I think), and it might be named after a man, like&quot;Tom&apos;s Diner&quot;or&quot;Bob&apos;s Ice Cream&quot;- something like that. They serve great food, fast service, and it&apos;s full of local color, run by a family. They also have an ice cream shop in there, if I remember correctly. It&apos;s a nice little place and the people are as sweet as can be.

Good luck! Retired-10 09-14-2004, 08:21 AM I&apos;m headed to FCI Butner on 9/24 from Cleveland. We&apos;re going to be staying in Creedmoor which is apparently a hop skip and a jump from the prison and that&apos;s where I&apos;ve been told many people stay when visiting. Some hotels are really cheap ($50/night)...but being a single girl, I&apos;ll be paying a tiny bit more for the Holiday Inn ($79/night). I just know that I&apos;ll be hopping on I-77 for entirely too long (about 8 hours)...then onto god knows what road... It&apos;s going to be such a long trip. I hope it&apos;s worth it! nomatterwhat 09-14-2004, 04:15 PM Oops, I forgot one of the interstates: 85, so from NE TN, it goes 421-321-40-85. I also called a friend from the area who said there is an Econolodge at the second Butner exit (coming from the west). I can&apos;t tell you anything about it, but it might be an option.

Good luck with your visit!!! concaqromex 09-14-2004, 05:01 PM Butner, North Carolina

Should I stay in Creedmoor, Raleigh, Durham or Chapel Hill, NC?

That is your choice. Creedmoor is the closest to Butner, NC. Durham, NC is only about twenty (20) minutes further than Creedmoor, NC and offers more hotel options and attractions http://www.durham-nc.com/visitor/ As a graduate of Duke University, I will be biased and recommend that you stay in Durham, NC and visit the Sarah Duke Gardens, Duke Chapel and Cameron Indoor Stadium http://www.duke.edu/about/visiting.html Ninth Street, next to East Campus, is also pretty cool http://www.ninthst.com/

Remodeled in 2002, the Brookwood Inn is located next to the Duke University campus, is affordable, clean, has HBO and ESPN, and refrigerators are available in some rooms.

Happy traveling and best wishes to your incarcerated loved one,
concaqromex ButterflyDancer 09-17-2004, 03:46 AM Thank you all for being so great. The information is super. You&apos;ve made it a lot easier.
I can really identify with being a woman traveling a long way to a place I&apos;ve never been before! Best wishes to you traveling to Butner and wishes, too, for a great visit. Maybe our paths will cross some day in the visiting room. :-) Godspeed to you all. WJ557

fci butner medium 11
federal correctional institution
p o box 1500

butner, nc 27509

only letter can be send there most have all of the above on it are they will return
go to bop.gov an you will finf out a lot about bunter rules, money ect aprilcat 04-20-2007, 06:44 AM Creedmor is definately the best place to stay if you have a loved one in Butner. I-85 basically splits the two&quot;towns&quot;in half ~ Butner to the west and Creedmor to the east. If you want to hit a nicer restaurant or shops, head down I-85 south about 5 or 6 miles, and get off on Roxboro Road. Just to the east is Northgate Mall and to the west are restaurants (about 2 or 3 miles up). Butner consists of the FCC, lots of state facilities (mental health center, home for the mentally retarded, Polk Youth Center with it&apos;s MAX wing for everyone, a juvie facilty, etc), but not much else!!! So, you might be wise to drive down the road a little into Durham for some&quot;action&quot;(G-rated, of course).&gt;^..^&lt;

Also, they are very strict about what you are wearing (at least at the medium facility), so make sure you bring&quot;very safe&quot;clothes and leave them in the car. If you have on a skirt and your knees are showing, they won&apos;t let you in. Depending on the guard, you may or may not be able to wear sandals, so bring a pair of closed-toed shoes. Only $5&apos;s and $1&apos;s allowed in, and change. You can only take your car key and driver&apos;s license and money to the visitation room, anything else, leave in the car, or you will have to leave in one of their lockers. Make sure you know your license plate #. They do drug-screen you with the wand, and they&apos;ll have to x-ray your shoes and a jacket. The visitation room is SMALL, so make sure you get there early. If it&apos;s nice, they&apos;ll open the little outside porch and that will provide a few extra tables. If you get a table, don&apos;t leave it alone, or it will get snagged.

Have fun!!!
