Wendy’s
 Posted on March 18, 2012 by liyenz 

With the given Wendy’s vouchers, I went to buy my Sunday’s lunch at the Wendy’s outlet which is located at Jalan Sultan Ismail. When I went into this fast food restaurant, there were some“ mat-salleh ”eating burgers there. The place looked quite empty.

I spent quite long looking at this menu before I decided which set I wanted to try.
 

Finally, I decided to get 2 sets of the Premium Fish Fillet (Cod Fish) .
 
 
I quite like their big fries. Unlike McDonalds, their fries’cutting is bigger than McDonald which I feel it is more filling.
 
This is how the burger looks like. From my personal taste, it is just another fish fillet burger, no further comment.
 
With purchased of 2 combo sets, I can get six pieces of nuggets for free. Yes, it is also part of the given vouchers. The nuggets were just normal nuggets that we can get it from the supermarket.

Then is there any specialities? I do not know. By the way, it is my first time eating Wendy’s after it has opened for few years in Malaysia. If you choose to eat here, you can get free refill carbonated drink.
 
And ample place to sit.
 
This is how their kitchen looks like. I waited quite long to get my burgers ready too. I guess it is because the burgers were not ready made like other fast food restaurants. They only cook when there is an order by customers.
 

Location:
Wendy’s (Besides 7-Eleven and Standard Chartered Bank), Jalan Sultan Ismail. 50250 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
