 What are some healthy foods I can take to work if I&apos;m on a diet?

 I&apos;m tired of eating the same thing day after day and end up finding myself eating the junk they have at work. I&apos;m hoping you guys can give me some inexpensive ideas for healthy foods/snacks to take to work. I have lost 34 pounds and don&apos;t want working again to stop the weight loss. And, we don&apos;t have a fridge, so everything goes into my cooler. What is Unique Hoodia hjortur100   Posts: 0 Joined: Wed Dec 08, 2010 3:27 am Top

 The easiest I&apos;ve found is fruit and yogurt. Veggies if you like them. They&apos;re all small, great snacks you can buy in bulk and cut up and bring what you need. arthritis forum ferehar   Posts: 0 Joined: Tue Nov 23, 2010 3:16 pm Top

 i make sure to keep a few different options. right now i have a pack of 60 calorie string cheese sticks (low fat, high protein), a pack of 90 calorie chewy granola bars (in case i want chocolate), some apples (they take a long time to eat so you get the feeling of eating), a pack of gum (for the feeling of chewing), 80 calorie yogurt (nonfat, high protein) heart diseases forum shayan14   Posts: 0 Joined: Sun Dec 05, 2010 10:29 pm Top

 -apple - 1/2 cup berries.. (or your choice of fruit servings)
-cucumber slices , or baby carrots
-mixed nuts (but don&apos;t exceed a handful a day) such as almonds or cashews
-raisins
-low-calorie snack bars: I know kellogs make ones that are only 90 calories each
-rice crackers: those are yummy and low in calories
-drinks include natural unsweetened juice/water/green tea... anxiety disorders forum wellington   Posts: 0 Joined: Mon Nov 22, 2010 5:24 pm Top

 I&apos;m right there with ya! I just started a diet 3 months ago and I&apos;ve lost almost 30 pounds. i&apos;m working out and i feel pretty good but i&apos;m so scared i&apos;m going to fall of the wagon.

I&apos;m trying so hard to avoid food at work. I work at a fast food restaurant an I get the food for free on top of it. so it&apos;s incredibly hard to say no, but i&apos;m doing well so far. i refused to eat that stuff and only bring in my own. I also have to keep my food out, so I can sympathize.

I can only offer what I&apos;ve done myself, and I&apos;m not sure what your tastes are. keep in mind that i save my healthy, energy and fulfilling eating for home. at work, it&apos;s all about trying to make it through the next minute.

- I generally bring in various cut fruit, like watermelon, cantaloupe and apples (lots of it! in order to avoid temptation, i often bring in way more than i even really want to eat, forcing myself to eat as much as possible so that i have no desire for anything else. now that i&apos;ve broken my bad habits, i&apos;ve been able to bring in less and less). i cut them in bite size chunks and i find they stay well even out of the fridge for a few hours. it&apos;s a light but filling meal. I do this 2-3 days a week. The added benefit is that it&apos;s easy to grab an go and you can mix up all your fruit each day. prepare it the night before and it&apos;s even easier to avoid excuses.

- It might sound weird, but I love fat free croutons. There are tons of them in your grocery store that you can choose from. I usually buy a couple of bags of fat free, low cal croutons of various flavors- rothsbury farms brand. I put a big helping into a baggie and eat them like chips (p.s.- their plain versions are great with fat free yogurt as a dip!). I know it&apos;s weird but I&apos;ve kind of had to get creative. I was getting sick of salads every day, dammit! the croutons give me that&apos;snacking&apos;feeling while also filling me up when i bring in the yogurt. it&apos;s helps with my boredom binging.

- i&apos;ve been playing around with salads lately. i try to step out of that standard green salad box. there are tons of things you can do. sometimes, i just buy different types of colored tomatoes and cut them up in a bowl with some chopped scallions on them. throw some yogurt dressing or low cal italian on there and you&apos;ve got a great, quick work meal. i also tried mixing strange veggies that i&apos;ve never had before. i once made an entire salad out of veggies i&apos;d never had. i also mixed different colored bell peppers cut in different ways with some cucumbers and just a splash of apple cider vinegar and it was yummy. find a veggie you really like and try to find different versions of it. mix it all together.

- someone once told me that you can get the same amount of energy by eating an apple in the morning as you would drinking a cup of coffee/soda. so i make salads out of 4 different types of apples, diced really small, with a very light, low fat whipped cream mixed through. not a lot, though, because i&apos;m trying to stay away from even&apos;low fat&apos;versions of the food i used to eat before. i&apos;m trying to change my life, not just&apos;diet&apos;. but it&apos;s a healthier version of a parfait that still fills you up and gives you a little sweetness.

- mix up your meals. don&apos;t be afraid to eat breakfast stuff in the afternoon and vice-versa. try some special k cereal with some walnuts, strawberries and bananas on it. use 2% milk in a carton. it should stay fine in your cooler until you go on break. even if it&apos;s at night, sometimes this stuff really hits the spot. bring enough for 2 bowls worth if you don&apos;t think it will fill you up.

keep in mind i always made *large* helpings- i&apos;m not trying to starve myself. i often brought home or threw away a bit. it&apos;s better now that i&apos;m over that initial diet phase, but i still bring it a bit more than i normally want. even if i throw a tad away, it&apos;s worth it if i avoid eating something that will undo all the good work i&apos;m doing. or if i end up starving on my way home and stop and get something.

hope some of these idea help! good luck!
