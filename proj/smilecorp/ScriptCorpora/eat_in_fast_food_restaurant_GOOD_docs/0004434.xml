Relay For Life Fundraising: A to Z
 
 
There are a ton of great fundraising ideas both for the individual
and the team to help you meet your goals. Be creative, have fun and ask
everyone you know or meet to help support your effort.

 A 

 Art Sales–This one is perfect for a kid’s team. Have
students produce great works of art and have a show. Parents and friends buy
back their budding artists’masterpieces.  Ask everyone you meet–Even if you have sent out letters, be sure to
carry a donation collection envelope with you so that when you talk to people
about Relay, you can ask them to donate right then. Take the donation
collection envelope with you to meetings. When you carry a donation collection
envelope with you, indicate your own contribution at the top. Make sure the top
few donations on form are significant. Other people are apt to follow suit;
conversely, if you start with a $2 contribution, others may follow suit with
$2. Don’t prejudge whether people will give. Let them say no or ignore your
letter rather than not ask. Auctions of All Kinds–
 Auction off a prime parking space at work. Auction off a half or whole day off from work. Auction a picnic lunch. Auction desserts, homemade dinners, local art work or
other creative and fun items. 
 

 B 

 A“No-Bake Sale”–Coworkers pay so they don’t have to
bake goodies. Book Sale–Dust those bookshelves and have a book
sale. “Boss for the Day”–Allow people to bid on being boss
for a day–high bid wins. Bake Sales–Hold a Friday bake sale so employees have
treats for the weekend. Ask for items to be wrapped attractively so they could
be given as gifts. “Brown Bag Lunch Day”–Everyone brings their lunch
and donates the money they would have spent for lunch to the Relay For Life
fund. 

 C 

 Carpool–for fun and profit. Clean up–with a neighborhood car wash. Car Window Washes–Teams can wash car windows at fast
food restaurant drive through windows. Challenges–Challenge another team to raise more than
you. Some radio stations may gladly put your challenge on the radio. Challenge by the Boss/Principal–Get the boss to
agree that if every team member raises their minimum of $100 that he’ll dress
up like a pig, shave his beard, sit in the dunking booth, or get a pie in the
face, etc. Change Jar–Keep a change jar in high traffic areas.
All change is donated to your team fundraising totals. Cook Offs Christmas Trees/Wreath–Ask a local retailer to
donate $1 for every tree and wreath sold. Cake Drawing Every Hour–Here is a fun and tasty
on-site fundraising idea. Team members bake different cakes, exchange tickets
for a donation and then raffle off the cakes each hour of the Relay. 

 D 

 Dime-A-Dance (at event)–Provide music at your
campsite. Have other people pay to dance with your team members. Host a theme
dance or party–Sock hop, beach party, disco, square dance, dance for senior
citizens, etc. Dedicate–Your personal effort to some-one who has
won a battle with cancer, or to someone who is battling cancer, or to someone
who has lost their battle–or all three. Include that in a letter along with a self-addressed envelope. Dress Down Day–Ask every employee to contribute to
your Relay team, and in return they will be allowed to“dress down”on a
specified day at work. Dinner–Hold a dinner. Have your team do a theme
dinner. Get a hall donated and have each member of your team prepare part of
the meal. Sell tickets and get some entertainment donated. 

 E 

 Envelopes at Restaurant Tables–Teams generate
donations by placing a Relay For Life envelope at every table, stating“Please
Support Our Relay For Life Team and the American Cancer Society.”Waitresses
check envelopes after each seating. 

 F 

 Flowers and Plants–Sell corsages, your donations
will blossom. Sell your extra house plants or bouquets from your garden. 

 G 

 Gift Wrapping–During the holidays, teams can set up
at the local mall or in a particular store. Mother’s Day is another ideal time
for teams to offer a gift wrapping booth. Garage Sales–Ask your team members to clean out
their attics, garages and basements and bring items in for a team wide sale. 

 H 

 “Hot Dog for Cancer”–Principal at an elementary
school agrees that if ALL the teachers raise $100 each, he/she would dress up
like a hot dog and let the students squirt ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, and
relish on him/her. Human Jukebox–Set up a decorated cardboard box with
someone that sings selected songs outside of a supermarket (after receiving
permission) and ask for a donation for each song that is requested. Handyman for a Day–Shovel snow, rake leaves or mow
your neighbor’s lawn and donate your“fee”to your Relay For Life. 

 I 

 Ice Cream Social–Teams can raise funds by collecting
donations for delicious ice cream delights. Get creative and decorate your
location as an old fashioned ice cream parlor and soda fountain. Set up tables
with a variety of board games for patrons. Play oldies on a jukebox and charge
for song requests. 

 J 

 Jail&amp;Bail–An old American Cancer Society
fundraiser. For a donation, employees can be arrested and for an additional
donation can post their own bail OR employees have a bounty placed on their
head, are arrested, and are not set free until the entire bounty is raised
($100+ per inmate). 

 K 

 Kiss The Pig–Select three to five well-known and
well-liked employees. Have the employees choose the individual they would like
to see kiss the pig by purchasing a jelly bean(s) for 50 cents each. The jelly
bean(s) will be placed in a jar for that individual. The individual with the
most beans will have to Kiss The Pig. 

 L 

 Lawn Service–While you are mowing your lawn, mow
someone else’s too. Luminaria–One of the most special parts of Relay For
Life is the Luminaria Ceremony in which bags filled with sand and a candle line

survivor. Ask friends, neighbors,
co-workers, etc. to make a donation for a luminaria to be lit in honor or in
memory of their loved ones.

total raised by your team or to be the leading honor for your team. (In order
