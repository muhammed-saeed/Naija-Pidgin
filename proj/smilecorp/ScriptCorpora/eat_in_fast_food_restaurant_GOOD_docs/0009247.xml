 After-Hours Work and Your Safety 

 Emergency Preparedness - Safety Bill Says... … we want you to take your safety and security as seriously as we do. There are certain precautions we can take or procedures to follow when we work by ourselves, after hours. Following is my list of recommendations, gleaned from personal experience as well as from other experts in safety and security:


 Ask your supervisor to provide you with a short list of phone numbers for emergency notifications. This should include his or her home phone, cell phone, or other after-hours phone number, phone numbers of other appropriate school officials, and appropriate law enforcement or fire numbers (911). This list should be something you could place in your wallet or pocket. Always let 1 or 2 close friends or family members know your hours and work location (address, building number, etc.). Check in with them at predetermined, regular intervals (once an hour, for example) by telephone. If you don’t phone in on time, have them call you. If you don’t answer, they are to call the police. Work out a plan with your supervisor for a ‘safe refuge’ you can go to if you run into a situation that poses a threat to your safety. That location should have a working telephone and a means of securing the door from the inside. If you get a call to go to a campus for an alleged break-in, vandalism, or burglary and you get there before anyone else; remain in your vehicle with the engine running and the doors locked. Wait for the appropriate authorities (police, fire, school manager, etc.) before exiting your vehicle. Make sure that you follow the instructions of the authorities and do not enter any building until they have declared it safe to do so. If you encounter a hostile person or persons on campus, leave the area immediately. If you believe that you can get to your ‘safe refuge’ do so and call your proper authorities. If not, get to a location where you know there are people (fast-food restaurant, gas station, etc.) and notify your proper authorities. Never prop doors open as you move about your work location. When you use a door that is locked, make sure you lock and close it after you enter or exit. If you find a door that is not locked or you find evidence that someone may have made a forced entry notify your proper authorities.”
