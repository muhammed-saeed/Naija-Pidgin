 Vapiano Italian Restaurant 7.3 
 

Are you hungry for Italian food? Come and check out the restaurant called Vapiano.


This is the chain restaurants, which were first originated in Germany.


What is interesting about this place is that this restaurant been created by Germans, but offer Italian food. The concept is very unique. Right form the first when you walked in the host will greet you and will give you the red Vapiano’s plastic card.
 

You need to give this card to the cook.


 
Eventually you will have everything you ordered on this card, and on the way out the same host will check what you have on this red Vapiano’s card in order to charge you. Next, you go to the kitchen station, where you order the food you would like.


 


They have the menu, and additionally everything is written on the black board up on the wall. You make a choice what do you want to eat: pasta, salad or pizza.


There is a specific station you need to go, depending on you choice.
 

They offer choice of white or regular pasta, any additional seasoning with it, and different type of sause.



Cook made everything in the front of you. So much fun just to observe this process! Can you imagine that somebody making the food specifically for you, and more than that in the front of you?


Many people still do not get the concept. And you will see a lot of bad comments online. But it is just matter of time. Last time I have been there last week, for lunch. 


My favorite dish there is Pasta Carbonara. Yumm!



Regular pasta, beckon or other sausage, prosciutto ham, eggs, creamy white souse, and a little bit of chopped parsley. Bellissimo! Bravissimo!


I tried pizza too. I was not too impre ss, will tell you truth. Their salads are good, but not too great. You can create you own salad or pizza. This is not a something new and creative in the USA world in now days.



This restaurant has a nice lounge in the front.

You can have a meeting there or just have a good time with your book.


I like this place in general. It is something new and fresh in the US. The way they run the place is different and unique. 
 

People are nice, and customer service is definitely too.


I am personally is not a big fan of pasta or pizza, but I love to hold my meeting there with great cappuccino, and absolutely superb traditional tiramisu. 


They have a couple of location: in Arlington, next to my family restaurant Grand Cru, DC area, and Dulles International airport area.

Try it and let me know your opinion. I am sure, that you will fine this place not ordinary, inexpensive, and just simply fun.

 Boston Market 6.3 
 
This post will be about Boston Mar ket. I am sure that you already tried this place, and most likely were satisfied with your experience.



Boston Market is lovely, clean, cozy and charming place. Food is always good and fresh.



The majority of items they offer are healthy for you. Last time, I have been there a couple of days ago for lunch with my colleague.

 

I had half

of rotisserie chicken , mashed potato, and cookie for desert.

My portion was very generous.

Chicken was perfectly cooked. I prefer the dark meat in chicken. It is more moist, not dry, little more calories, but still a good amount protein and not too much fat.

 

I like their chicken noodle soup too. But this time I preferred the cookie over the soup. I am not sure if they bake them in the house or not.

They tasted fine, no complains. Surprisingly, that day this particular Boston Market on Colombia Pike, Arlington was not very busy. We had our food in 5 minutes.



All lunch together was less than 10$. Perfect!

 

The employees are nice as usual, nothing in particular about customer service. I respect the fact that place is always clean, fresh, and light. You can tell that management is in control.



Overall, I enjoyed my lunch: fast, inexpensive, yummy. Try it and you will enjoy it too!

 PF Chang&apos;s 7.2 
 Yesterday, I had a lunch at another chain restaurant“ PF Changs ”this is sort of fancy chinese restaurant.



They want to have this status, but I do not think that they actually can qualify. I do not visit this place often.


And this time I schedule lunch there with one of my friend, who I have not seen for good 2 years. We were communicating by phone, but very rarely. P.F. Changs is not a fast food restaurant, and had a dinning service.

So, it was very convenient for both of us to meet there for lunch.

 For lunch this restaurant offering Lunch bowl special.
 There six to eight differ ent items you can choose, including hot and sour or egg drop soup . All that for $9.99. Good deal, ah! 

 
 I asked for glass of red wine, SIMI Merlot from Sonoma County, CA. Our server had no i dea what I am talking about. He asked me 3 times, what kind of wine I would like, and finally I just showed it on the menu. 


 I am not trying to be difficult, but if you are salling the wine, and trying to qualify for a fine dining restaurant, make sure you know the product you are serving. Otherwise, it is a shame! The pour was 7 to 8 ounces. This is absolutely unacceptable in fine dining restaurants. Your pour should be 4 to 5 ounces . This is a classic pour. And why? Because it is easier to swirl your glass and bring more oxygen into your wine , in order to get more aromas and flavor. So, this fact is not sophisticated. 
 
 The restaurant was busy for Wednesday lunch. We got our food in 30 minutes, which is understandable in this case. I ordered Sesame Chicken Bowl and hot and sour soup. The lunch portion was ok, not athentic Chinese. 


 
 Usually, Chinese food, is chip and a bpg portion. Because of the cost of ingredients are not expensive at all. So, we had a gallon of wine, and not a lot of food. I am ok with this fact, but other people might not be fine with it. 

 
 One time I tryed there tuna tartare . That was good: very fresh, no smell from the fish, great wasaby dressing. 

 Another think that I liked about this place is that host gave me opportunity to choose the table where I want to sit. This was very nice. 

 

 In addition, by the end of our meal, we got fortune cookies . This was fun! I liked this par t. The interior in the restaurant I fine. Inside is dark, and nothing special about des ign of bar area. 


 So, we had mediocre lunch experience. I am definitely not putting this restaurant at the same level as fine dining. Now, you know why I am not a regular customer in this restaurant. 


 Try this restaurant yourself, may be you will have luck!

 Grand Cru 7.1 
 This post is going to be about the restaurant Grand Cru , owns by my husband and me. We open Grand Cur 3 years ago on August 24th at 2 pm.

My husband left for Switzerland.

This was the scheduled trip and he could not cancel it.

 So, I, my chef, and my servers were opening this place at that day. I remember, we already had potential customers, who were looking at the windows, and asking when place will be open.


Here it is!

From the beginning, the restaurant business was very slow, and this fact was expected. People do not know the place, and we needed to do marketing and promotions.

 
Eventually my servers left, because of lack of business, and I was performing as a server, sometimes cook, and dishwasher, accountant, and lastly the manager. It was taught, but this was only start.

 

Challenges were everyday: chef did not show of for his shift, food comes very slow, short staff on the front. All situation, in general was a little bit a disaster.

I never run restaurant before.

This was the first time experience. Nobody taught me anything regarding this matter, and I was learning and figure tings out as I went. Before you open, you have no idea about the thing you have missed or have not paid attention before the open. Especially, if this is you first restaurant in you life.


Eventually, things got better. We started to have our regular customers, who were supporting the Grand Cru every day.

Our team has changed many times during the restaurant existence. Usually, stuff rotating often in the restaurant business.


Now, we have great people with us, who help Grand Cru be more successful and well know in the local area around the Arlington. Customer service is critical in the restaurant business.

 
I am happy that my servers are very personal and welcoming, charming and warm with Grand Cur’s customers .

We have delisious item on the menu; it took us a while to get there.


Finally, Grand Cru is gaining popularity, success, individualism and pride around the area.

 

I hope, one day I will see you, my friends, there, and will be proud to offer you a glass of good wine and some tapas to snack on with it.

See you there soon! Posted by My restaurant experiences at 8:27 AM No comments: 
 Ruby Tuesday 6.2 
 Again Woodbridge!


 This time my story about Ruby Tuesday . We visit this place with my husband often. It located very close to our house. 

 Last time we went there for quick snack before we went to a movie. I ordered glass of Chateau St. Michelle Riesling , Chips, and Guacamole. 
 
 My husband got the mini cheeseburger sliders and a beer. We set in the bar area. Our beverages were on the bar immediate ly, and food arrived maybe 10 minutes later. 

 I always enjoy their guacamole. Every time I go there I order this item. It has big chunks of not mashed completely avocado, chapped tomatoes and seasoning. 

 These creamy chunks of avocado/guacamole and chips would be perfect with beer, but I choose wine, specifically Riesling. 
 Riesling is light bodied, crisp, fresh and little sweet wine. 
 My husband was enjoying his sliders too. They were nice. I tried them: fresh and juicy meat, right temperature and good seasonings. 

 I like the fact that Ruby Tuesday restaurant have a lot of woodwork inside: gorgeous wood bar and tables. Another awesome thing is the salad bar. You can eat as much as you want. However, whole beauty about it is that the prod ucts are fresh, regardless if this is mix greens or cold pasta salad.
 Usually, after our dinner or lunch we go for desserts: chocolate lava cake with scoop of ice cream . It is amassing! Warm chocolate lava melted with vanill a ice cream. 
 What can be better finish of your dinner? A couple of words about service. 
 This time we were sitting in the bar area. Our bartender was very bubbly, and energizing. We had a feeling of good care and attention. He gave us many suggestions on wine and food. So far, I have not had a bad experience in dinning in Ruby Tuesday. I keep trying this place to know more of their dishes. I will let you know if there will be a bad one. I hope not!

 Panera 6.1 
 
 One another good place for lunch is Panera . 
 This place started form baking bread and now very famous for their sandwiches. I personally think that one of the most important ingredients in making a sandwich is good freshly baked bread like in Panera. 


 
 
 Last week I had another great lunch in my life. It was in Panera Bakery Cafe. For my lunch, I usually like something light and simple. 

 Panera is the perfect place for it. I ordered Smoked Turkey sandwich– cold cuts –and cup of soup. I love Panera’s chicken noodle: perfect size, good consistency and texture, and made from the scratch, which is very important part in food business. My sandwich was cold, as I mention before, cold cuts. There was couple of slices of smoked turkey, decent Swiss cheese, little bit of dijonaise, tomatoes and red onion. Perfect lunch sandwich for me! That day Panera was busy, but I got my food very fast. Beside sandwiche s and soups, Panera bakes good pastries: scones, cookies, coffee cakes. 
 
 They are to die for. I am not a chocolate p erson, but I appreciate a good pastry . Moreover, they offer hot breakfast everyday. And off course, their specialty bread: French baguette , Assiago Cheese , Tomato Basil , etc. I like this place. The food is always consistent: the same ingredients and recipes. 
 Lunch is very reasonably priced, and always fast, so you can go back to you off ice in no time. Back to my story about visiting the Panera. I finished my meal, had a fresh brewing c offee, and I took to go with chocolate éclair for my afternoon snuck. Overall, the experience was delightful. This is my regular place for lunch, and so far, it as not turned me down yet.

 Cosi 5.3 
 Last week my boss asked me to pick up a lunch for her meeting from Cosi. 


I generally like this place for lunch: reasonable prices, great bread, and fresh ingredients.


This Café have very tasty sandwiches and other full meal items for lunch and dinner. 



That day they were very busy. People were waiting for their food up to 40 minutes. Restaurant was operating on very high volume service. I was shocked.
 

I was thinking that no way I could be on time for my meeting lunch. I had ten orders altogether, plus, walking distance within 10 minutes. I took a risk and placed my order. It included five of salmon salads with dressing on the side, two regular TBM , one Chicken sandwich, and two Crab cake melt sandwiches. 



In addition to this order, every food item had a side with it: bread, chips, or baby carrots. Surprisingly, the food did not take too long: 20 minutes or so.


 
I left the place, and did not even check if the order was fully complete. I came in my office and checked it; the sides were missing. It was a disaster! But, the requirem ent for salads“dressing on the side”was followed.

That was impressive!



I turned around and went back to the Cosi. Likely, I still had time.

The manager believed me right form the beginning. I got rest of my order, and nobody said a word, or questioned me if I was telling the truth or not.


Overall, I completed my task, even though it was a nightmare for me. Everybody from the meeting was happy with his or her lunch.



I had a Crabcake Melt sandwich, and was not too happy about the meal. There was not too much crabmeat, and sandwich has not been made with great effort. My understanding of this fact was that they were literally swamped.


 
I visit Cosi often for lunch, and will continue doing that. Restaurants have busy and slow days in a year.



The food in Cosi is still great and the cust omer service too. Great place for lunch: fast, delicious, and very affordable prices.
