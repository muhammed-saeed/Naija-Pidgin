 The Spongebob Squarepants
 Movie Description 

In the&quot;spongebob squarepants the movie&quot; SpongeBob
 SquarePants takes leave from the town of Bikini Bottom
 to track down King Neptune&apos;s stolen crown. Why? Because
 when the main suspect turns out to be Mr. Krabs , SpongeBob
 stands by his boss and vows to find the real culprit,
 even after just being passed over for the promotion
 of his dreams. SpongeBob and Patrick travel for the
 first time on land to retrieve the crown and clear
 Mr. Krabs’name.

How many movies offer the rare spectacle of a parasailing pink starfish
 flying over a crowd with a congratulatory pennant clenched between his
 buttcheeks? And that&apos;s only the tip of the iceberg--The SpongeBob SquarePants
 Movie is a freewheeling goof of a cartoon, full of surreal twists as
 its diminutive heroes head down a dangerous road to rescue the lost crown
 of King Neptune.

The underwater world of SpongeBob is lovingly created with wit, charm,
 sass, and not just a little societal tongue-in-cheek. SpongeBob himself
 is a remarkably engaging little fellow, at once credulous and simple
 and immature, yet pure and innocent and impossible not to adore, once
 the action gets going and you see the goodness in his spongey little
 heart. Likewise for Patrick, the lobotomized starfish.

Despite Mr. Krabs’decision to not promote him, SpongeBob is willing
 to risk his life to save the hamburger mogul. King Neptune’s daughter,
 Princess Mindy, continually urges her heavy-handed father to show his
 subjects compassion. She intervenes to spare the life of a servant unduly
 sentenced, begs Neptune not to terminate Krabs and encourages SpongeBob
 and Patrick while they&apos;re on their dangerous mission. Ultimately, her
 empathy for the underwater citizens is acknowledged by King Neptune,
 who apologizes for his harsh ways.

“You are who you are”is heard throughout
 the movie, emphasizing to kids the lesson of self-acceptance
 and self-respect. Entire scenes (and songs) are dedicated
 to proving that no matter how old you are, you can
 make a difference. Mindy tells SpongeBob,“It
 doesn’t matter if you’re a kid. ... You&apos;ve
 just gotta believe in yourself.”


SpongeBob Squarepants (voiced by Tom Kenny), an arrested adolescent in
 the mold of Pee-wee Herman, works at a fast-food restaurant that serves
 something called Krabby Patties (as the restaurant owner is himself a
 crab, it&apos;s not clear what exactly they&apos;re made of). Spongebob&apos;s best
 friend Patrick Starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) lives under a rock and has
 an IQ in the lower digits. Still, their friendship carries them through
 many a tight spot as they strive for manliness.

It is a cute, funny and imaginative Spongebob movie. A great undersea
 adventure.Lots of funny spongebob jokes.
Featuring the voices of Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, Alec Baldwin,
 and a fully fleshed appearance by David Hasselhoff.
