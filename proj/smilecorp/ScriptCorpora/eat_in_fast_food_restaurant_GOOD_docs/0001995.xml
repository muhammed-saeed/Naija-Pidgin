PREFACE, 



THE present Work is executed upon the same Plan, as the Author&apos;s two former 
Volumes of THE TOPOGRAPHY OF ENGLAND. The favourable reception of which, 
by the Public, has excited his sincere gratitude. Whilst his experience in Research 
has greatly diminished the difficulty of his Undertaking. 

The Kingdom of Great Britain having beeen recently united with Ireland a 
perfect uniformity with the preceding Volumes is not to be expected, particularly 
in that kind of information which incidentally arises from Returns ordained by 
Law, or directed by Government, or either House of Parliament. Of this kind are 
the Poor Returns of 1803, arising from the legal Provision for the Maintenance of 
the Poor : a Policy singular and peculiar to England, and not likely to be imitated 
elsewhere, as the most able opinions are not agreed whether the benefit is com- 
mensurate with the great expense and infinite trouble occasioned by the Poor&apos;s 
Rate ; which, however, has made the Boundaries of Parishes, and their relative 
value, better known in England than, perhaps, in any other Country. 

Neither has any authentic Inquiry into the Population of Ireland hitherto been 
instituted, though a Bill to that effect was introduced into The House of 
Commons in February 1806 ; but which was silently abandoned by its Author. 

In England also the LIBER REGIS, compiled chiefly from the Valor of King 
Henry the Eighth, furnished a mass of Ecclesiastical Information of which the 
Author fully availed himself. Mr. Seward, in the Appendix to his TOPOGRA- 
PHIA HIBERNICA No. VI, has given a Table of the FIRST FRUITS of the Ecclesi- 
astical Benefices in Ireland, as taxed in the King&apos;s Books, which he states, to have 
been accurately copied from the Original Record in the Chief Remembrancer&apos;s 
Office, and was printed in a Tract, intituled, &quot;VALOR BENEFICIORUM ECCLESI- 
ASTICORUM IN HiBERNiA,&quot; which has been used upon the present occasion. 

In addition to this VALOR, which appears to have been compiled between the 
29 of Henry V11I (1538), and the 5 of Charles I (1630), authentic Ecclesiast- 
ical Information of great weight and value has recently been obtained by 
Government, so that the state of the Church of Ireland is better known, 
and consequently better illustrated than that of England in the former Volumes 
of this Work. i 



PREFACE. 

In the month of June 1805, The House of Commons ordered certain Returns 
to &apos; e made from the several Dioceses of Ireland, and these Returns were ordered 
to be printed in February 1806. They are signed by the Registers of the several 
Dioceses, and contain the names and number of parishes comprised in each UNION 
of PARISHES; the period of time when such parishes were united, and the Authority 
under which such Union was effected ; the number of acres of Glebe which 
appertain to each parish ; whether any Glebe House for the Residence of the 
Incumbent is erected thereon ; and the distance at which United Parishes lie 
from each other, when such parishes are not contiguous ; and whether any and 
Avhat number of Churches, in which Divine Service is performed, are now sever- 
ally thereon, or were at the time when such Parishes were united. 

But the spirit of Inquiry, so successfully begun, did not rest here. In a dis- 
patch from Earl SPP.NCER, dated Whitehall, the 18th of June 1806, to His Grace 
the Lord Lieutenant (then Duke of BEDFORD), we find His Lordship stating, that 
&quot; Among all the important subjects which are involved in the Government of that 
&quot; part of the United Kingdom over which Your Grace is appointed by His 
&quot; Majesty to preside, there is none on which His Majesty&apos;s paternal care for the 
&quot; welfare of His Subjects leads Him to look with more anxiety than the Present 
&quot; State of the Established Church of Ireland, and the obvious necessity of 
&quot; adopting, without delay, any proper measure for its Support, and for remedying 
&quot; those Evils under which it at present unfortunately labours.&quot; 

&quot; In having recourse to Your Grace on this occasion&quot;, continues the Noble 
&quot; Earl, &quot;I have the greatest satisfaction in knowing that your Habits, Opinions, 
&quot; and Disposition, are such as to inspire the fullest confidence of your cordial 
&quot; concurrence in promoting these important Objects ; and I flatter myself that 
&quot; the mode of proceeding which, upon the most mature Consideration, it has 
&quot; been thought advisable to pursue, will ensure to us the zealous Co-operation 
&quot; of the very respectable Prelates who are now placed at the Head of the 
&quot; Church of Ireland, at the same time that it affords the most unobjectionable 
&quot; as well as effectual means of procuring the Information required. 

&quot; With these Views I have His Majesty&apos;s Commands to direct Your Grace to 
&quot; write to The Lord Primate, and the three other Archbishops of Ireland, desir- 
&quot; ing that they will, with as little delay as possible, procure in their respective 
; Provinces, and transmit to Your Grace, for His Majesty&apos;s Information, the most 
&quot; accurate Accounts that can be furnished of the actual Situation of the Established 
&quot; Church of Ireland, more especially on the following important Points: 

&apos; The present State of Residence of the Clergy in each Diocese respectively, 
&quot; and the means which exist of enforcing it : the Obstacles which may be in the 
&quot; way of it, by the want of Churches, of Glebe Houses, or otherwise ; and the 
:&lt;best mode of applying such Funds as now are applicable, or may hereafter be 
&quot; granted by Parliament for these Purposes : 



PREFACE. IX 

&quot; The number of Livings, in each Diocese, of a Value too small to afford to Re- 

&quot; sident Incumbents the means of comfortable subsistence: 

&quot; The Allowance now given to Curates in cases of allowed Non-residence of the 

&quot; Incumbent, and the number of Curates who may be resident or non-resident 

&quot; upon their Cures : 

&quot; The State of the Unions of parishes ; the number and extent of each Union; 
&quot; the authority by which they were made; and the propriety of their being re- 
&quot; spectively continued or dissolved. The Regulations which it may be proper to 
&quot; establish by Law or otherwise on this subject, both to prevent any Union being 
&quot; henceforth improperly made, and to preserve the Churches and Glebe Houses 
&quot; from dilapidation, where there are more than one in the united parishes ; and, 
&quot; generally, all such other matters of information as may suggest themselves to 
&quot; Your Grace, or as may occur to the Archbishops themselves, as likely to be use- 
&quot; ful towards enabling His Majesty to give effect to His benevolent and paternal 
&quot; intentions for the protection and support of the Established Church of that 
&quot; part of the United Kingdom.&quot; 

In consequence of these instructions, the Lord Lieutenant addressed a Circular 
Letter, dated the 16th of July 1806, to the several Archbishops of Armagh, Dub- 
lin, Cashel, and Tuam, communicating to them the foregoing dispatch, and ex- 
pressing his fullest reliance on their earnest assistance and zealous co-operation in 
forwarding the King&apos;s intentions ; And, at the same time, subjoining a List of 
Queries * to be submitted to the several Bishops within each Province. 

* As these Queries are so excellent, and exemplary, the author has been induced to subjoin them in the 
following note. 

&quot; QUERIES 
To be addressed by the several ARCHBISHOPS of IRELAND, to the BISHOPS in their respective Provinces.

PREFACE. 



Upon the Answers to these Questions, which were ordered to he printed by 
The House of Commons on the 29th of July 1807, and which contain many valua- 
ble remarks, THIS TOPOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF IRELAND rests its principal 
claim to the attention of the Public. The enlightened Earl who first moved the 
inquiry, and the Reverend Prelates who so attentively promoted his intentions, 
have merited the warmest gratitude of their Country. It has long been the mis- 
fortune of Ireland to be .little known: But from henceforth, let no one complain 
of the want of intelligence concerning The Established Church. The approbation 
of an humble individual may be of no moment, but the Author hesitates not to 
avow this to be, in his limited capacity, one of the most satisfactory and valuable 
Reports which has ever been laid before THE UNITED PARLIAMENT. 

Of the publications which have preceded the present Work, in illustrating the 
Topography of Ireland, the first in order is, &quot; THE POST-CHAISE COMPANION : 
OR, TRAVELLER&apos;S DIRECTORY THROUGH IRELAND. Dublin 1786. 8vo.&quot; This 
Book was printed by Mr. Wilson, and usually goes under his name. At page 5, of 
the Introduction, this description of the roads of Ireland is stated to be upon a 



4. What cause is there for the non-residence of such 
as do not reside ? 

5. By whom are the duties discharged? 

6. Is there any Glebe House within the Benefice ? 

7. In what parish is the Glebe House situated ? 

8. What Glebe Land* belong to the Benefice ? 

9- Are they contiguous to, or, how far removed 
from each other ? 

10. How near are they to the Church; or, in cases 
where there is no church in repair, how near are they 
to the site of the old church ? 

III. 

What Livings are in the different Dioceses of a 
value too small to afford to Resident Incumbents the 
means of comfort ; and by what mode may the con- 
dition of each be most improved ? 

IV. 

What is the allowance now given to Curates in 
case of permitted non-residence of the Incumbent; 
and the number of Curates, resident or non-resident, 
upon their Cures? 

V. 

1. What i the best mode of remedying the evil in 
each particular case of non-residence? 



&apos;2. What are the powers which now exist, of en- 
forcing residence, or which it may be necessary to 
recommend to the legislature to provide for that pur- 
pose ? 

VI. 

What is the best mode of applying such funds as 
are now applicable, or hereafter may become so, to 
the purpose of building or reparing of Churches or 
Glebe Houses, or the improvement of Glebes or 
otherwise ? 

VII. 

What regulations appear to be proper to be es- 
tablished by law or otherwise, to prevent Unions, 
Perpetual or Episcopal, from being henceforth im- 
properly made ; and to preserve Churches and Glebe 
Houses from dilapidation when there are more than 
one in the united parishes?

What can be suggested in addition to the foregoing 
Queries, for the improvement, protection, and sup- 
port of the Church of Ireland }

plan similar to Mr. Patterson&apos;s useful Book of the English Roads ; with this very 
material advantage, that descriptions of Towns are given, together with accounts 
of ihe most remarkahle Buildings, Antiquities, modern Improvements, natural 
Productions, and many other particulars worthy the Traveller&apos;s attention. The 
actual Surveys by Messrs. Taylor and Skinner are also said to have been used, 
and many other well authenticated documents. Sir Richard Colte Hoare in his 
expressive language says, this &quot; is the best Iter I ever saw.&quot; And it is worthy 
of remark, that the late Mr. Gough has incorporated almost the whole of this 
book in his edition of Camden&apos;s Britannia, 1789- 

In the year 1789, was published &quot; THE HIBERNIAN GAZETTEER; BEING A DE- 
SCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL PROVINCES, COUNTIES, ClTIES, POST AND FAIR 

TOWNS, ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED; WITH A CONCISE HISTORICAL AND GEO- 
GRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF IRELAND. THE WHOLK COLLECTED FROM THE BEST 
AUTHORITIES AND MOST ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS. BY WILLIAM WENMAN 
SE\VARD, ESQ. Dublin. 1789. 12mo.&quot; The Author in his Preface says, &quot; the 
nature of the present Undertaking at once evinces its utility. It was intended to 
give aconcise view of the State of this Kingdom, and its Antiquities, inamanner 
both pleasing and instructive.&quot; After a well turned compliment to the merit of 
the writings of the late Charles Smith, M. D., Mr. Seward concludes his Preface 
with an extract from some important queries, which Dr. Smith recommends to the 
curious, to enable them to make proper inquiries into the Natural and Civil State 
of their respective Neighbourhoods. In this publication, Mr. Seward has thrown 
into an Alphabetical form the Descriptions, contained in Wilson&apos;s Post-Chaise 
Companion, prefixing an Historical Introduction. The design being laudable, 
it appears to have met with suitable encouragement. 

And, in the year 1797, we find the same Gentleman publishing under an 
improved form, &quot; TOPOGRAPHIA HIBERNICA ; or, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF IRE- 
LAND, ANCIENT, AND MODERN. GIVING A COMPLETE VIEW OF THE CIVIL 
AND ECCLESIASTICAL STATE OF THAT KINGDOM. Dublin, 1797, 4to.&quot; In this 
edition, Mr. Seward has availed himself of the labours of The Rev. Mr. Archdall, 
and more especially of The Rev. Dr. Beaufort, who, in 1792, published his 
&quot; MEMOIII OF A MAP OF IRELAND;&quot; which, under this modest title, contains a 
succinct account of the Civil and Ecclesiastical State of Ireland, and an Index of 
all the Places which appear on his Map. 

The careful Research exemplified in the Construction and Explanation of this 
truly Original Map are generally known. But, it would be unpardonable in the 
Author, who has compared Dr. Beaufort with the more recent Ecclesiastical Au- 
thorities, not publicly to bear testimony of his Accuracy of Investigation, in collect- 
ing materials for a Book, which is an Ornament to Ireland, 

In the present Work, the subjects are arranged in the same order as in the Topo- 



X JJ PREFACE. 



graphy of England ; with such unavoidable omissions, as have been explained in 
the beginning of this Preface. 

The Orthography of the names of parishes has been determined by a careful 
comparison of the Diocesan Returns, Dr. Beaufort&apos;s Memoir, and other Topogra- 
phical Books. 

As the Reader may require an explanation of that part of the Work which 
relates to the PROVINCES, it is proper to mention, that Ireland is divided, with 
respect to its Civil or Political distinctions into the Four Provinces of ULSTER, 
LEINSTER, CONNAUGHT, and MUNSTER; which are subdived into Thirty-two 
Counties, in the following manner. 

The Province of ULSTER comprises the nine Northern Counties, being those 
of Antrim, Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry, Monaghan, 
and Tyrone. Together with the great body of Water, LOUGH NEAGH, which, 
according to Dr. Beaufort, covers 58,200 acres. 

The Province of LEINSTER comprises the twelve Eastern Counties, being 
Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, King&apos;s County, Longford, Louth, Meath, 
Queen&apos;s County, West Meath, Wexford, and Wicklow. 

The Province of CONNAUGHT comprises the five Western Counties, being 
Gal way, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo. 

The Province of MUNSTER comprises the six Southern Counties, being Clare, 
Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford. 

With respect to its Church Establishment, Ireland is divided into the four 
Provinces of ARMAGH, DUBLIN, CASHEL, and TUAM. An Archbishop presides 
over each. These Provinces are subdivided into Thirty-two Dioceses, which 
are united or consolidated under eighteen Bishops, in the following order. 

The Archbishop of ARMAGH, who is LORD PRIMATE, and METROPOLITAN OF 
ALL IRELAND, presides over the eight Suffragan Bishops of Ardagh, Clogher, 
Deny, Down and Connor, Dromore, Kilmore, Meath, b and Raphoe, in the 
Northern Province. 

The Archbishop of DUBLIN, who is LORD PRIMATE OF IRELAND, presides 
over the three Suffragan Bishops of Kildare, Leighlin and Ferns, and Ossory, in 
the Eastern Province. 

The Archbishop of CASHEL, who is LORD PRIMATE OF MONSTER, presides over 
the five Suffragan Bishops of Cloyne,Corkfld Ross, K]l\a.]oeand Kilfenora, Limerick 
and Ardfert and Aghadoe, and Waterford and Lismore, in the Southern Province. 

The Archbishop of TUAM, who is LORD PRIMATE OF CONNAUGHT, presides 
over the three Suffragan Bishops of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, Elphin, and Killala 
and Achonry in the Western Province. 

b The Bishop of Meath has precedence of all Bishops, and next to him The Bishop of Kildare. The other 
Bishops take place according to the date of their Consecration. j 



P&apos;RKFACK: xm 

The number of Deanries in this Kingdom is Thirty-three, and of Archdeaconries 
Thirty-four. But the Archdeacons, according to Dr. Beaufort, have not a Visita- 
torial jurisdiction ; the Government of the Church of Ireland, which is in most 
things conformable to that of England, differing with respect to Visitations : 
For in Ireland, the Bishops hold a Visitation annually, and the Archbishop visits 
his Suffragans every third year. 

When the PROVINCE, therefore, is mentioned, in Succession to the COUNTY, it 
is to be understood with reference to the Civil Jurisdiction, And, on the other 
hand, when the PROVINCE is noticed, in its order with the DIOCESE, it applies to 
the Established Church. 

The Distances and Bearings of the several parishes are given from their nearest 
Post-Office towns, which are all set from the City of Dublin. The distances from 
thence are according to the Post-Office account. In all cases, where distance is 
expressed, the scale of Irish miles has been used, in conformity with the Road 
Books. And, in all the Cross roads (as observed in the Preface to the former 
Volumes), the direct distance has been measured on the Map from the nearest 
Post-Office town to the place in question, and to that distance, one seventh part 
more has been added ; except in mountainous or marshy counties, when a 
greater proportion has occasionally been allowed. For the information of strangers, 
it may also be proper to remark, that eleven Irish Miles are equal to fourteen 
English Miles. 

o 

A considerable alteration having taken place in the state of the Representation 
of Ireland on the Union in 1801, the following Extract, with the hope of its being 
found useful, is copied from &quot; AN ACT TO REGULATE THE MODE BY WHICH THE 
&quot; LORDS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL, AND THE COMMONS, TO SERVE IN THE PAR- 
&quot; LIAMEXT OF THE UNITED KlNGDOM ON THE PART OF IRELAND, SHALL BE 

&apos;&apos;&quot; SUMMONED AND RETURNED TO THE SAID PARLIAMENT. WHEREAS it is 

&quot; agreed by the Fourth Article of Union, That Four Lords Spiritual of Ireland, by 
&quot; Rotation of Sessions, and Twenty-eight Lords Temporal of Ireland, elected for 
&quot; Life by the Peers of Ireland, shall be the Number to sit and vote on the Part of 
&quot; Ireland in the House of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ; and 
&quot; One Hundred Commoners (Two for each County of Ireland, Two for the City 
&quot; of Dublin, Two for the City of Cork, One for The College of The Holy Trinity 
&quot; of Dublin, and One for each of the Thirty-one most considerable Cities, Towns 
&quot; and Boroughs) be the number to sit and vote on the Part of Ireland in the 
&quot; House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ; be it enacted 
&quot; by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent 
&quot; of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament 
&quot; assembled, and by Authority of the same, That the said Four Lords Spiritual 
&quot; shall be taken from among the Lords Spiritual of Ireland in the manner follow- 
&quot; ing: that is to say, that one of the four Archbishops of Ireland, and three of 



PREFACE. 

&quot; the eighteen Bishops of Ireland, shall sit in the House of Lords of the United 
&quot; Parliament in each Session thereof, the said right of sitting being regulated as 
&quot; between the said Archbishops respectively by a Rotation among the Arch- 
&quot; iepiscopal Sees from Session to Session, and in like manner that of the 
&quot; Bishops by a like Rotation among the Episcopal Sees : That the Primate 
&quot; of All Ireland for the time being shall sit in the first Session of the Parliament 
&quot; of the United Kingdom, the Archbishop of Dublin for the time being in the 
&quot; second, the Archbishop of Cashel for the time being in the thiul, the Arch- 
&quot; bishop of Tuam for the time being in the fourth, and so by Rotation of Sessions 
&quot; for ever, such Rotation to proceed regularly and without interruption from 
&quot; Session to Session, notwithstanding any Dissolution or Expiration of Parliament: 
&quot; That three Suffragan Bishops shall in like manner sit according to Rotation of 
&quot; their Sees, from Session to Session, in the following order ; the Lord Bishop of 
&quot; Meath, the Lord Bishop of Kildare, the Lord Bishop of Derry, in the First

&quot; the United Kingdom ; the Lord Bishop of Ossory, the Lord Bishop ofKillala 
&quot; and Achonry, the Lord Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, in the Sixth 
&quot; Session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; the said Rotation to be 
&quot; nevertheless subject to such variation therefrom from time to time as is herein- 
&quot; after provided: That the said twenty-eight Lords Temporal shall be chosen by 
&apos; all the Temporal Peers of Ireland in the manner herein-after provided; that 
&apos; each of the said Lords Temporal so chosen shall be entitled to sit in the House 
&apos;* of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom during his life; and in case 
&apos; of his death, or forfeiture of any of the said Lords Temporal, the Temporal 
&apos; Peers of Ireland shall, in the manner herein-after provided, choose another 
&apos; Peer out of their own number to supply the place so vacant. And be it enacted, 

That of the One Hundred Commoners to sit on the part of Ireland in the United

comfort to a Resident Incumbent. See, Croom. &quot; An House was founded here on 
the South side of the Town, for Friars of the Order of the Holy Trinity, for the 
Redemption of Christian Captives in the reign of King Edward the First, by John 
Earl of Kildare. One Writer alone gives this foundation to the Family of Clan- 
gibbon. Some large and very perfect Ruins of this Friary still remain. The 
Steeple resembles a castle, and is supported by a plain Arch, with four diagonal 
Ogives meeting in the centre, and stairs leading to the battlements. The Nave 
and Choir are small and plain, without any thing remarkable; in the rear arc 
several other ruins : the entrance into the Friary was by a low gate on the West 

4 



ADR 

side, which is still standing. An Augustinian Friary was founded on the South side 
of the river by John Earl of Kildare, son to Earl Thomas, who died in the year 
1315. A great part of this Friary still remains in good preservation : the Steeple, 
similar to that of the Trinitarians, is supported on an Arch : the Choir is large, 
with Stalls,&amp;c., and the Nave answerable thereto, with a lateral Aisle on the 
South side: to the North of the steeple are some beautiful Cloisters with Gothic 
windows, within which, on three sides of the square, are Corridores, and on most 
of these windows, are escutcheons with the English and Saltire crosses, generally 
ranged alternately : the workmanship is simply elegant, the principal parts 
being of hewn lime-stone, which appears so fresh, as to give it, on the whole, a 
modern, yet venerable appearance. Adjoining the cloisters are several apart- 
ments, which seem to be much more ancient than the other parts of the building. 
This description of these Friaries was taken in the Month of May, 1781. A Gray 
Friary was founded in the East part of the town, in the year 1465, by Thomas 
Earl of Kildare and Joan his wife, daughter of James Earl of Desmond. No 
traces of this Friary can now be found, save a lofty square Steeple.&quot; ArchdalFs

constitute the Union of Clashmore. Affane is in the Diocese of Lismore, and 
Province of Cashel. It is 4 m. S. E. b. E. from Lismore. It is situate upon the 
River Phinisk, near its junction with the River Blackwater. The Fairs are holden 
on the 14th of May, 13th of August, and 22d of November, A bloody Conflict 
was fought here, on the 1st of February, 1564, between the Earls of Ormond and 
Desmond, in which the latter Nobleman had three hundred men killed. It has 



A G H 

been famous for its Cherries, which were first planted here by Sir Walter Raleigh 
who brought them from the Canary Islands. Affane was formerly called Arth- 
meane, or Aghmean, from Agh, a Ford, the River Blackwater being fordable here- 
abouts. In the Ecclesiastical Report, the Vicarages of Affane and Aglish are recom- 
mended to be perpetually united, and Glebe Land purchased, and a Glebe House 
built: and though it is apprehended, that this Union would be of much too small 
value to afford comfort to the Incumbent, yet it might be very advantageoxisly 
increased by the purchase of Glebe Lands. See, Clashmore.

the Northern parts of Ireland, in the year 5 15, he was the son of Laidie, an emi- 
nent Poet, and his mother&apos;s name was Mella. To this Saint the Abbey of Aghaboe 
owes its foundation, of which he was the first Abbot, and continued to preside here 
till 598, when he died, in his 84th year. The Festival of St. Canice is celebrated 
on the llth of October. On the 10th of April, in the 43d of Queen Elizabeth, 
this Monastery, with its Appurtenances, and the Advowson of the Rectory of 
St. Kennie of Aghaboe, was granted to Florence Fitzpatrick, at the annual rent of

West and South Windows are handsome Gothic work; the Church is 100 feet in 
length and 24 in width, has three Windows to the South, one at the East, and one 



A G n 

at the West. In the centre to the South is a small Oratory, called Phelan&apos;s Chapel, 
and divided from the Church by an Arch, resting on a Pillar of solid Masonry / 
between the East Windows of this Chapel is a Pedestal, intended for a Statue, and 
under it a stone, hollowed and shaped like an inverted Cone, with eight grooves, 
supposed to be for holy water: A door on the North side leads you into a quad- 
rangle of sixty feet : the Cells for the Friars, usually ten in number, lay to the 
East, and opposite thereto was the Kitchen, with apartments for servants ; the 
Cellars were large, and over them the Abbot&apos;s apartment, measuring 46 feet by

which is valued in the King&apos;s Books at&lt;ll. sterling, was founded, according to 

Dr. Beaufort, in the middle of the Fifth century. In 1658, it was united to the 

Bishoprick of Kilmore, and continued so, till Dr. Hort was promoted from those 

Sees to the Archbishoprick of Tuam in 1741, when they were again separated, and 

Ardagh was annexed to the Archbishoprick; which Union has continued ever since, 

though the Diocese of Elphin intervenes between them. It extends into six 

counties, and yet is a very small Diocese ; the greatest length from North to 

South being 42 miles, and the breadth, which is in some places but four, never 

exceeding 14 miles. In this Diocese there are a Dean, and Archdeacon, 

but no Chapter, nor Episcopal Residence ; neither can the Church of Ardagh be 

called a Cathedral. The Patronage of one parish belongs to the Crown- the 

Bishop presents to thirty ; and a Lay Patron to six. &quot; St. Patrick founded uu 



A R D 

Abbey in this town before the year 454, over which he placed St. Mell, the son 
of his sister Darerca, both as Abbot and Bishop. Some writers make this 
Saint the Founder, but in that particular they must err, as Archbishop Usher in- 
forms us, that he acquired an humble livelihood by the labour of his own hands, 
and died on the 6th of February, A. D. 488. He was buried in his own church, 
and was said to have wrote a treatise on the virtues and miracles of St. Patrick.: 
We know not when the Franciscan Friary here was founded, but are told, that it 
was reformed by the Friars of the Strict Observance in the year 1521.&quot; ArchdaU&apos;a

to have been the first erection : the other, stands about a mile North-west of the 
former, and is very ancient ; an handsome Gothic arch, which separates the body 
of this church from the chancel, yet remains, and the pillars supporting it are more 
massive than those of the Tuscan order, which denotes the antiquity of the build- 
ing ; the chancel is roofed, and at present is used for Divine Service. On the 
West end of this church are some figures in alto relievo, in free-stone, venerable 
for their antiquity, viz., Adam and Eve, with the tree and serpent, the judgment 
of Solomon,&amp;c. Here also is a fine Round to\ver, upwards of 100 feet in

uous, and near the church : The Hon. and Rev. Viscount Lifford, LL. D., the 
Dean (in 1806), who has cure of souls, is resident, and discharges the duties, 
assisted by a Curate. Armagh is in the Diocese of Armagh, and Province of 
Armagh. It is 62 m. N. b. W. from Dublin. The Fairs are holden on the 2 1st 
of May, 10th of July, 12th of August, Tuesday before the 10th of October, and 
the 0th of November. This City (now called the Town} sends one Member 
to Parliament : Patronage, in the Lord Primate. The Assizes for the County 
are holden here. The Magistrates are a Sovereign, and Register. It is situate 
near the River Callen. It has six Post-days in the week. According to Dr. 
Beaufort, the city of Armagh, which was very much decayed, was renovated, 
and is become a pretty town, of good size, and well inhabitated, through the 
attention and munificence of Richard Robinson, D. D., Baron Rokeby, late 
Lord Primate : who built there a handsome Archiepiscopal Palace, and a noble 
House for the School, which is one of the Royal Foundations (of Charles the 
First), and is extremely well endowed. To these His Grace added a Public 
Library for the promotion of science. He also erected a complete Observatory, 
with a liberal establishment for the support of an Astronomer ; and secured the 
permanency of his endowments, by several Acts of Parliament, obtained for that 
purpose. This See, which is valued in the King&apos;s Books at l83..17..1^ ster- 
ling, was founded by St. Patrick about the middle of the Fifth century, and was 
made an Archbishoprick, in the year 1152. It extends into five counties, being 
59 miles from North to South and varying in breadth from 10 to 25 miles. The 
Chapter consists of a Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, Archdeacon, and 
four Prebendaries, with eight Vicars Choral. The city of Armagh is 35 miles 
distant from the extremity of the Diocese. According to the Report of the 
Commissioners of the Board of Education, the lands, with which the School of 
Armagh is endowed, contain, as appears by the last Survey, made in the year 1771, 
1530 acres English measure, including Roads, Lakes, Rivers, and also about 100 
acres of Bog. The Lands are situate in the county of Armagh, between the 
towns of Newry and Armagh. It appears, that these lands produced, in the 
year 1804, the gross annual rent of \ 144..10..5|. The present Master, The 
Rev. Thomas Carpendale, A. M., was appointed by Primate Robinson, in the year 
1786, to be Master, upon the resignation of Dr. Gruebere, for a valuable consider- 
ation. Mr. Carpendale is stated to have paid, during the whole time that he has 
been Master, the closest and most laudable attention to the duties of the School ; 
and no School in this country maintains a higher reputation than that of Armagh. 
&quot; St. Patrick, the great Apostle of this Kingdom, founded an Abbey here, A. D. 
445, or in 457, for Regular Canons of the Order of St. Augustin, and dedicated it 
to the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul; it continued, for many ages, one of the 
most celebrated Ecclesiastical Foundations in the world. This Abbey, and all 
the possesions thereunto belonging, were granted, in May 1612, to Sir Toby 



A R R 

Caulficld, Knight, at the Rent of 5. Irish. The Culdei, or Colidei, were secu- 
lar Priests, and served in the Choir of the Cathedral of Armagh: their President 
was called, The Prior of the College of the Culdei, and was a Precentor to the 
said church : Upon a vacancy, a Prior was elected by the whole College of the 
Culdei, but he received his confirmation from the Archbishop. Temple Brigid 
is said to have been founded in this Town by St. Patrick. Temple Fartagh, or 
The Church of the Miracles, was founded without the town by the same Saint, 
for St. Lupita, his eldest sister, who was buried here : And, in the beginning of 
the last century, her Body was found buried deeply under the rubbish of her an- 
cient Nunnery, in a standing posture ; two crosses were also discovered closely 
guarding the body before and behind. On the 9th of January, 1618, King James 
granted the Monasteries of Temple Fartagh, and Temple Brigid, to Francis 
Annesley, Esq. Porter in his Annals tells us, that there was a Dominican Friary 
at Armagh ; which is more than probable, otherwise the Primate Scanlain, who 
was of that Order, would not have made his Foundation for the Friars Minor. 
The Friars of the Order of St. Francis were brought into this Town, A. D. 1261, 
and Patrick Scanlain, who was then Primate, built a House for them two years 
after: Though Wadding, the Franciscan, as quoted by Allemande, assures us, 
that it was founded, in the year 1291, by O&apos;Donnel. The Franciscans of the 
strict observance began to reform this Friary in 1518, but it was not then per- 
fected. In 1580, Walter Mac Cuard was Guardian, and, in 1583, Solomon Mac 
Conny was Guardian, in whose time the reformation was completed.&quot; Archdalfs

ARMOY, v. ARDMOY. 

ARRAGELL, v. ERRIGALL. 

ARRAN, ISLES, off the Barony of Moycullin, Co. of GAJL.WAY, and Province 
of Connaught. Three Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, opposite to the Bay of Gal- 
way ; the principal of them was called, Arran Naomh, that is, Arran of the Saints, 
a number of churches having been erected in this island, in which the bodies of 
many Saints repose. ^Engus, king of Cashel, at the request of St. Albeus, 
granted this island to St. Enna, or Endeus, who built ten churches on it ; and 
about the year 490, he was Abbot of Killenda, the principal of those churches, 
and to which all the rest were subject. The feast of St. Endeus, who died in the 
beginning of the Sixth century, is observed on the 21st of March. The Middle, 
or Second Island, on which are only two churches; one is called, Teampull- 
ceannan-nach, each of them was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and both were 
subordinate to the church of Killenda. -Ardoilen, the third of the Isles of Arran, 
was anciently called Aracoemhain, and took its name from St. Coemaun, the 
Patron of it. Three churches were erected here, that of Kil-choemhain, where 
St. Columb is honoured, another dedicated to St. Paul, and the third, called 
Kil-gradh-an-domhain, in which St. Gobnata is honoured on the 1 1th of February. 



A S II 

Kil-choemhain was a Monastery of note, and was founded by St. Fechin. The 
Abbot St. Gormgal, justly celebrated for his piety, died A. D. 1017, on the 
5th of August, on which day his feast is holden ; from whence we must conclude, 
that this abbey existed several ages. A Franciscan Friary was founded on one of 
these islands in the year 1485.&quot; Archdalts Monast. Hibern.p. 271. 

ARRAN MORE, ISLAND, off the Barony of Boylagh and Bannogh, Co. of

two Churches ; one, at Artrea, the other, at Lisnamarron, both in good order : 
no Glebe House ; 130 Irish acres of Glebe ; 100 of which are in the parish of 
Donaghmore, 19inDysertlyn, and 11 in Artrea, not contiguous; the two former 
being 10 miles asunder, the two latter about five : those lying in Donaghmore are

ASH HO, v. ASTRATH. 



A T H 

ASK EATON, in the Barony of Connello, Co. of LIMERICK, and Province of 
Munster; a V., valued in the King&apos;s Books at 0..10..0 sterling, having been 
always holden with the entire Rectory of Lismakeery, but are considered as only 
Episcopally united : a Church, in good repair, in Askeaton : no Glebe House : a 
Glebe, of 3 a. 2 r. 23 p., in Askeaton, near the church; and another of 
13 a. 2r. l6p., in Lismakeery, near the old church there: The Rev. Gusta- 
vus Wybraiits, the Incumbent in (1806), who has cure of souls, is resident 
in the parish of Askeaton, and performs the duties in person. Askeaton is in the 
Diocese of Limerick, and Province of Cashel. It is 14 m. W. S. W. fronj Lime- 
rick. It is situate upon the River Shannon, on the influx of the River Ded. The 
Fairs are holden on the 30th of July, and 9th of October. The Castle was built 
by the Earl of Desmond. It was formerly a large walled town, but is now a 
mall depopulated village. A Monastery was founded here, adjoining to the 
castle, in the year 1490, for Conventual Franciscans, by James the seventh Earl 
of Desmond. This Monastery, according to Mr. Archdall, was of such conse- 
quence, that a Provincial Chapter of the order was holden there in the year 156*4. 

ASSEY, in the Barony of Deece, Co. of MEATH, and Province of Leinster : 
a R., Episcnpally united, in 1798, to the Rectories of Balsoon, Clonarney, and 
Killagh : no Church : no Glebe House : 13 acres of Glebe, in Killagh, lying in four 
parcels near the ruins of the old church ; and two acres also in Assey, near the ruins 
of the old church : The Rev. Mark Waimv right, the Incumbent (in 1806), who 
has cure of souls, and is non-resident, being the Inspector and Chaplain to the 
Gaol of Trim, where he resides : The duties are discharged by the neighbouring 
Clergymen. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, it appears, that another dis- 
tribution of these parishes would be expedient : they are of small income, and 
there are other parishes also of small incomes contiguous to them, with which they 
might be perpetually united, if the Patrons would give their consent. Assey is 
in the Diocese of Meath, and Province of Armagh. It is 4 m. S. from Navan. It 
is situate upon the River Boyne. This parish contains 690 acres of land. The 
parishes of Assey, and Balsoon, are contiguous ; those of Clonarney, and Killagh, 
are at the distance of 121 miles from them, and these again are separated by the 
intervening parishes of Dysertale, and Castletown Delvin. 

ASTRATH, anciently ASHRO, EASROE, and EASRUADH, and also THE 
ABBEY DE SAMARIO, in the Barony of Tyrhugh, Co. of DONEGAL, and Prov- 
ince of Ulster. Is situate on the River Erne, near the Town of Ballyshannon. 
&quot; An Abbey was founded here for Monks of the Cistertian Order by Roderick 
O&apos;Cananan, Prince of Tyrconnt-11. He was slain in battle by O&apos;Flachertach, who 
succeeded him : some writers make O&apos;Flachertach the founder. This abbey was 
a daughter of that of Boyle.&quot; Archdalfs JMonast. Hibern. p. 93. 

ATHADDY, in the Barony of , Co. of CARLO.W, and Province of Lein- 
ster. &quot; About the year 1151, an Abbey was founded here, for Nuns of the Order 



A T H 

of St Augustine, by Dermot, the son of Murchard, King of Leinster. He ap- 
pointed it to be a Cell to the Nunnery of St. Mary de Hoggis in the- city of 
Dublin.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. p. 35. 

ATHASSEL, in the Barony of Clanwilliam, Co. of TTPPERARV, and Province of 
Munster : a Rectory entire, and united, at a period prior to any known record, to 
the Rectories entire of Ballygriffin, Dangandargan, and Relickmurry : a Church, in 
good repair : no Glebe House, but one about to be built : a Glebe, lately obtained, 
of &apos;JO acres : The Rev. Patrick Hare, the Incumbent (in 1806), who has cureof souls, 
is resident in the adjoining parish of Cashel,and performs the duties. Athassel is in 
the Diocese of Cashel, and Province of Cashel. It is 3^ m. W. from Cashel. 
It is situate upon the River Suir. The parishes in the union of Athassel 
are contiguous, and contain together about 7000 acres. According to the Ec- 
clesiastical Report, this union is not too extensive for the accommodation of the 
Parishioners, and the convenient performance of Parochial duty. &quot;Here Wil- 
liam Fitz Adelm de Burgo founded a Priory, under the Invocation of St. Edmund 
the King and Martyr, for Canons Regular of the order of St. Augustin. The Prior 
sat as a Baron in Parliament, The ruins of this abbey show it to have been 
equal, if not superior, to any monastic edifice in this kingdom. The choir mea- 
sures 44 feet in length and 26|- in breadth ; on the North and South sides are 
small aisles, which we rather suppose were&apos;designed for some other purpose, as 
their communication with the main building is by doors parallel to the choir,&amp;c. . 
on the South side is a long range, with one entire low arch, 24 feet broad and 37 
long : it then diminishes to 10 feet in width, and stretches out 24 feet longer ; on 
the West end thereof, and on the South side of the nave, are part of the windows 
and outer walls of the cloisters, forming a square of 63 feet ; on the South side is 
another long range of building, with the lower part divided by arches. The nave 
appears to have been of the same breadth with the choir, and supported by lateral 
aisles ; it measures by the exterior walls 1 17 feet in length and 58 in breadth ; 
in the South-west corner is a small chapel, with an ar-ched roof sustained by diag- 
onal and central ogives. The steeple was a lofty square building, of which the 
South side only remains. About forty yards West of the nave, is an entrance 
through a small gate, wherein had been a portcullis ; the passage to this is by a 
small ancient bridge, over alow, marshy piece of ground ; the view from hence, 
through the nave and steeple, terminating at the high altar, must have been highly 
picturesque. To describe minutely each part of this extensive ruin would be in- 
sufferably tedious; we shall, therefore, only add, that the whole work was uniform, 
regular, and finished in a fine limestone.&quot; Archdnlts Monast. Hibern. p. 640. 

ATHBOY, in the Barony of Lune, Co. ofMr.ATH, and Province of Leinster : 
a V., valued in the King&apos;s Books at,23..14..2/m/i Money, and united, by Act of

August, and 7th of November. The parishes in the Union of Athboy are con- 
tiguous ; that of Athboy containing 5881 acres. It has six Post-days in the week. 
&quot; On the 17th of October, 1317, a license was granted to William de Loundres, 
permitting him to make a grant to the Friars of the Blessed Virgin of Mount 
Carmel, in Athboy, that Lot of ground in the said town whereon this Monastery 
was erected.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. p. 513.

a Church, in Athenry, in good repair; and a Church or Chapel of Ease, in Mo- 
nivea, being in the parish of Athenry, in good repair : no Glebe House, or Glebe 
Land ; but one small House or Cabbin, in the town of Athenry : The Hon. and 
Rev. Joseph Bourke, the Incumbent (in 1806), who has cure of souls, and having 
a Faculty, resides in his Deanery House in Kilkenny, in the Diocese of Ossory :

Athenry, at a Salary of ,60. per annum : and The Rev. David Gregg, his Resident 
Curate of Abbert and Duy Mac Loughney, at a Salary of 60. per annum. Athenry 
is in the Diocese of Tuam, and Province ofTuam. It is 97 m. W. b. S. from 
Dublin. It is an ancient corporation, and is governed by a Portrieve. It gives 
title of Baron to the Family of Bermingham, Premier Baron of Ireland. The 
Fairs are holden on the 5th of May, 2d of July, and 28th of October. It has 
three Post-days in the week. The extent of the parish of Athenry is about 10

A T H 

miles in length, and 1 about 9 miles in breadth.&quot; Meyler de Bermingham, tlic 
second Baron of Athenry, gave to the Dominican Friars 160 Marcs to assist in 
building this house, and granted the land whereon to erect it; he also presented 
to them (on the completion of the building, as we suppose) an hogshead of wine. 
De Berminghain was induced to begin this work by letters from St. Dominick, and 
a noble Monastery \vas erected here, under the Invocation of St. Peter and St. 
Paul, in the year 1241. The ruins which remain of this friary, prove it to have 
been a sumptuous building ; part of it was taken down to erect in its room the 
present Barracks, and the Cloisters probably stood where the Barrack-yard is now ; 
the whole was well built of a blue coloured stone ; the tower, for half its height, 
is larger below than above. The great East window is bold and of good work- 
manship : there were here numbers of Mausoleums, but the soldiers have erased 
them all, and with their fragments the church is nearly covered. A Franciscan 
Friary was founded here in the year 1464, under the Invocation of St. Michael, 
by Thomas Earl of Kildare ; his wife, Margaret Gibbon, erected the^first Chapel ; 
the second was built by an Earl of Desmond, and the third by O&apos;Tully.&quot; Arch-

on the South side of Belfast Lough &quot; St. Comgall was born in Ulster of noble 

Parentage, and was educated under St. Fintan, in Clonenagh. About this time 
(555) he founded here a celebrated Abbey ; where, in this year, Cormac, King of 
South Leinster, took on him the Cowl; and died A. D. 567- In a Parliament 
holden this year (1380), it was enacted, that no mere Irishman should be suffered 
to make his profession here. The Abbot enjoyed a Town-land in the Isle of Man, 
called Clenanoy, on condition that he should attend on the King of that Island at 
certain times. The Abbey of Bangor was so gone to ruin, in the year 1469, 
through the neglect of the Abbot, that Pope Paul the Second commanded that 
the Friars of the third order of St. Francis should immediately take possession of 
it, which was accordingly done, says Wadding, by Father Nicholas of that order. 
A small part of the ruins of this abbey still remain : the windows were of the

It is situate at the bottom of a very extensive Bay, to which it gives name, on the 
Atlantic Ocean, and which is said to be capable of containing all the shipping in 
Europe. It was formerly, according to Mr. Wilson, called Ballygobbin, as also The 
Old Town, to distinguish it from another Settlement more to the North, called The 
New Town, where Ircton,\n the time of Oliver Cromwell, had a Fortification erected, 
with four regular Bastions, which caused the Inhabitants to build near it: but, when 



BAR 

this Fort went to decay, they returned, by degrees, to The Old Town, called Bdntry, 
from it* being the chief settlement of the Half Barony. This place is memorable 
for the landing, attempted to have been made there by the French, under the 
command of General Hoche, in December, 1796; And gives title of Baron to 
Richard White, now Viscount Ban try, for his truly loyal and important services 
upon that occasion. From Ban try there is a Ferry-boat, which passes to Bear Haven, 
being much safer and shorter for travellers, than going by land, round the Bay.

of Dorset : the Master of which has&lt;20. per annum, with an House and Garden. 
According to the Ecclesiastical Report, this Benefice is too small to afford the

Lord Buttevant, founded a Monastery here, A. D. 1 290, for Conventual Franciscans, 
and dedicated it to St. Thomas the Martyr. But this Foundation must have been 
earlier than the time here set down ; for we find that William Barry, in the 



BOW 

1273, granted the whole church of Cathirdufgan to the Prior of Buttevant. Some 
are of opinion, that this house owed its origin to one of the family of Prender- 
gast, but the Monument of the Barrys being in the centre of the choir, confirms 
to them the honour of this foundation. The walls of the Choir and Nave, with 
several other buildings, including the Steeple, which is an high square tower, 
erected on a fine Gothic arch, are yet entire ; to the South is the Chapel of the 
Virgin Mary ; which, with the Monastery, forms a picturesque ruin. On the 
North side of the monastery stands a ruined Tower, called Cullin, said to have 
been erected by one of the Earls of Desmond, who retired thither. There were 
some fine Paintings in fresco on the walls of this monastery, and a few of. their 
remains are still visible. This house Was repaired by the Roman Catholicks, in 
the year 1604. Near the monastery stands another ruin, which is said to have 
been a Nunnery, under the Invocation of St. Owen or St. John the Baptist ; but 
we can find no account whatsoever either of its Foundation or Order.&quot; ArchdalCs

a celebrated Abbey of Cistertian Monks. The remains of this ancient erection are 
sufficient to shew its pristine magnificence. The ruins lie at the back of the town, 
and are inclosed in the demesne of the Earl of Kingston. The chancel and a small 
Chapel on either side are roofed ; the great arches which supported the tower were 
45 or 46 feet in height, but the ground is now so raised as to cover all the 
bases of the columns ; one half of the arches are supported by round pillars, 
built of cut stone, of various sizes, and the rest are a group of small columns, or 
moldings; all the spaces between those pillars are now filled up, so as to make a 
solid wall, and which, as we suppose, was done in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 
when the abbey was converted into a place of defence. Some of the capitals are 
plain, others are ornamented with carvings, and the East window was grand and 
lofty. There are no remains to be seen of the Cloister, that part being long since 
converted into a Barrack. The stump of a Round tower near the abbey is still 
to be seen.&quot; ArchdalVs Monast. Hibern. p. 601.

founder was James, father to Peter Earl of Ormond: James died on the 16th of

under two Gothic arches which yet stand near the East window. The Nave of 
the church of Callan, with its fine lateral aisles, still remains in good preservation ; 
the choir is now the parish church ; and the cemetery of the founder&apos;s family, over-

CARRICK-BEG, formerly, CARRICK MAC GRIFFIN, in the Barony of 
Upper Third, Co. of WATEHFORD, and Province of Munster ;. in the parish of 
Dysart. It is part of the suburbs of Carrick upon Suir. Here is an excellent 
stone-bridge over the River Suir, which affords a communication between the two 
Counties of Waterford, and Tipperary. &quot; A Monastery was founded here for 
Conventual Franciscans in the year 1336, by James Earl of Ormond, and the first 
Friar was admitted therein on Saturday, being the festival of St. Peter and St. 
Paul; at which time Stephen de Barry was appointed Minister, friar William 
Naisse keeper, and friar John Clynne, of the Franciscan friary of Kilkenny, was 
appointed the first warden. The steeple of this monastery, dedicated to St. Mi- 
chael, still remains, and is a very curious building, about 60 feet in height, rising 
from a single stone, like an inverted Pyramid, which point begins several feet 
from the ground towards the middle of the side-wall of the church.&quot; ArchdalVs

contiguous ; that of Carrickfergus containing 9565 acres of land. The Assizes 
are holden here both for the County of Antrim at large, and for the district of the 
town. It was once the first Sea-port in the North of Ireland, and defended by a 
strong Castle. But the port is now little frequented, and the Castle is no longer 
garrisoned, though it still possesses a Military Governor. &quot; The foundation of a 
Monastery here, for Franciscan Friars, is fixed in the year 1 232, but it is a matter 
of doubt who was the Founder: Some say, the famous Hugh de Lacie, Earl of 
Ulster: according to others, O&apos;Neal; we are inclined to the former. This 
monastery was in such high repute, that a general Chapter of the Order was 
holden in it, in the year 1510. At the suppression of Religious houses, this 
monastery and its possessions were granted to Sir Edmund Fitzgerald, who 
assigned the same to Sir Arthur Chichester, ancestor to the Earl of Donegal. This 
nobleman, who was several times Lord Deputy of Ireland, erected a noble Castle 
on the site of this monastery, about the year 1610.&quot;- ArchdalCs Monast. Hibern.

the Castle belongs. It was formerly a walled town, and part of the wall still re- 
mains. The parishes in the Union of Carrick upon Suir are contiguous ; their ex- 
tent being very great. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, the entire Rectory 
of Killmurry, and the Vicarages of Carrick upon Suir, and Ardcullom, ought to be 
perpetually united; and a Glebe House ought to be built in the parish of Carrick upon 
Suir.- &quot; William de Cantell and Dionisia his wife, the daughter of Thomas son of 
Anthony, founded a Priory on the banks of the Suire, in honour of St. John the 
Evangelist, for Canons Regular following the Rule of St. Augustiu. Thomas Duff&apos;,

church, which, still venerable in ruins, stands upon the Rock of Cashel, 
having fallen to decay in the time of his Predecessor. The palace is a plain, large 
house, in the city of Cashel, to which a Publick Library is annexed. There is no 

part of these United Sees more distant than 25 miles from Cashel &quot; An Hospital 

for sick and infirm poor, with fourteen beds and three Chaplains, was founded here 
to the honour of St. Nicholas, by Sir David le Latimer, Seneschal to Marian, who 
was Archbishop of Cashel from the year- 1224 to 1238: the said Archbishop 
granted to this hospital two flaggons of Ale out of every brewing made for sale 
within the limits of thirty messuages in this town, and David, a succeeding Prel- 
ate, did, by force and violence, unite this hospital to the Cistertian Abbey, about 
the year 1272, A Dominican Friary was founded adjoining the town, (but not 
within the Liberties of the Corporation) and dedicated to St. Dominick, in the year 
1243, by the Archbishop David Mac Kelly, who was himself a Dominican, and 
supplied it with brethren from the Friary of Cork. General Chapters of the 
Order were holden here in 1289 and 1307. This monastery, as lately evinced, 
was the noblest and most beautiful building belonging to the Dominican Order in 
Ireland. Hacket&apos;s Abbey was founded for Conventual Franciscans in the reign 
of King Henry the Third by William Hacket. In the night of the 14th of 
February 1757, the lofty and beautiful steeple of this friary fell to the ground. 
This erection was situate at the rere of Friar-street, and is now so much gone to 
ruin, that it is scarce possible to trace the divisions of the building : What remains 



CAS 

measures East and West about 150 feet in length, and 25 in breadth: on the 
South side, opposite the centre of this range, is a small chapel with niches for 
candles, the same as those at Hore Abbey, and an handsome window : Here are 
several old tomb-stones, on which are crosses, but no inscriptions. In the year 
1781, the great East window, and many other parts of the abbey, were pulled 
down to employ the materials in private buildings.&apos;&apos; Arch doll&apos;s Monast. Hibern.

cious observations of his friend, Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., &quot; that Castlebar 
is one of the neatest towns in Ireland. The houses are well built, and good look- 
ing, and no town in the Kingdom is more rapidly increasing. Lord Lucan interests 
himself extremely about the welfare of this place, which belongs to him, together 
\vith the surrounding country; and what is so truly praise-worthy, has the high 
character of being one of the best of Landlords. His Lordship is now building (in 
1790) a very large Linen Hall, with various conveniences for those who are con- 
cerned in that trade : over which is an handsome Assembly Room. Close to this 
building is an Hotel, which is conducted in a style of civility and comfort, that 
is exemplary. His Lordship has a good house here, surrounded with much 
large timber, chiefly elm, which grows well in this soil.&quot; See, Aglish.

which a very interesting description (accompanied with an engraving) is given by 
Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., V. P. L. S., in Sowerbys Brit. Miscel. vol. ii. p. 1. 
Of the great Baronial Estates, attached to this Castle, it may not be improper 
briefly to mention, that Sir Theobald Bourke, the FOURTH Viscount of Mayo, 
being left a Minor, preferred a petition, upon his father&apos;s death and forfeiture, to 
the Commissioners of Government for a maintenance : Who declared, on the 15th of 
April, 1653, that if he would repair to Dublin, and make application to them, they 
would take care that he should be decently educated, and maintained. He repaired 
to Dublin accordingly, and was placed under the tuition of Mr. John Stephens, 
then Master of the Free School. Some time after which, he was sent for to Eng- 
land by his mother&apos;s relations, with whom he lived till the Restoration of the King. 
On the 14th of May, 1661, he took his seat in the House of Peers, ami on the 
18th of July, delivering a petition to be restored to his estate, it was ordered- by 
the House, that he should be recommended to the Agents in England, particu- 
larly to supplicate his Majesty on his behalf, to be comprised in his declaration : 
Wherefore, on the Act of Explanation, he was decreed to his estate, by the Com- 
missioners for putting that Act in execution, on the llth of April 1666&apos;, and on 
the 30th of August following, had a grant of the benefit of that decree, consist- 
ing of 50,000 acres of land, and five Manors in the County of Mayo. He died 
on the 5th of June 1676, in St. Patrick&apos;s, Dublin, and leaving no issue, was suc- 
ceeded by his brother, Miles, the FIFTH Viscount, who, for some time after his 
marriage, having no prospect of issue, was prevailed upon to sell part of his es- 
tate, for the discharge of some debts which he had contracted. He died at Castle 
Bourke, in March 1681, and left an only child, Theobald, the SIXTH Viscount of 
Mayo; who was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Theobald Bourke, the SEVENTH 
Viscount, and he dying without issue, the honour devolved on hjs only brother, 
John, the EIGHTH Viscount, who took his seat in the House of Peers on the 10th of 
November 1743: His Lordship died, on the 12th of January 1767, in Pall Mall, Lon- 
don, since when the title has lain dormant. These large estates have partly passed 
by marriage, and partly by sale. This Castle is entire, and in good repair : which, 
together with the adjacent territory, lineally descended to Aylmer Bourke 
Lambert, Esq., were, in 1790, granted by that Gentleman to his agent, Mr. 
Bourke, on a lease for three lives and sixty one years; and by whom the Castle is 
now inhabited.

told, that there was here a religious house or chapel dedicated to St. Fynan, with 
two tenements adjoining. This was a burial-place of note; and&apos; in war-time the 
circumjacent inhabitants were exempt from all the accustomary burdens of the 
country. In the centre of the circle was a stone cross and two yew-trees, from 
one of which hung a bell. This house was in being in the year 1396, and 20th of 
the reign of King Richard the Second, for about that time the Priests belonging 
thereto procured for themselves and their successors certain lands in perpetuity, 
without obtaining the King&apos;s consent, and contrary to the statute of mortmain. 
John Lye of Rathbride, gentleman, being seized of divers lands in the said town-

down and destroyed the cross and trees, and erected a tower or small castie, with 
other buildings.&quot; Archdalfs Monast. Hibern. p. 313.

decay, was in the earlier ages a Bishop&apos;s See. &quot;St. Keran, the son of the carp- 
enter, who was born A. D. 506, gave Clonard, with every appendage thereof, to St. 
Finian, some short time before his death, which happened about the year 549, on 
which, St. Finian, who was of a noble family, a philosopher, and an eminent di- 
vine, founded this abbey, (which he dedicated to St. Peter) and had therein a 
school, celebrated for producing many men eminent in the learned world, and of 
exemplary piety. This Saint died of the plague, the 12th of December 548, on 
which day his feast is commemorated. The entrance into this abbey, on the 
West side, was through a small building, with a lodge over it, which led into a 
small court; to the right of this court stands the kitchen and cellar, and over 
them the dormitory, ranging with the river, and over-looking the garden which 
sloped from thence to the water&apos;s edge; opposite the entrance was another small 
apartment, and adjoining it the refectory, which was carried for some length 
beyond the square, and joined the choir, a large and elegant building, most part of 
which still remains, and the windows are finished in a light Gothic style. On 
the South side of the altar, fixed in the wall, is a small double arch, in the old 
Saxon manner, and divided by a pillar through which iron bars were fixed; this is 
supposed to have been the Founder&apos;s tomb. There are many remains of walls ad- 
joining the other parts of the abbey, but in so ruinous a state, that little informa- 
tion can be gleaned from them. At a little distance from the East window, in the 
burial ground, stands a small Chapel, in which is a cable monument, ornamented 
with the etiigies of a man and a woman, in a praying posture, and dressed in the 
ruff of Queen Elizabeth&apos;s time; the sides are adorned with many coats of arms; 



C L O 

that of the family of Dillon is most conspicuous. The nunnery, for Regular Can- 
onesses, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was endowed before the arrival 
of the English by O&apos;Melaghlin, king of Meath, This nunnery was afterwards 
reduced to so great penury, that it became a cell to the nunnery of St. Brigid

C L O 

a small Glebe often acres near Clogher, and the Union of the two parishes of

appropriated in the year 1613. The present Archdeacon is in possession only of 
the Rectorial Tythes of Ciontibret, and the glebe near Clogher. See, Clontibrct. 
&quot; An Abbey dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul was founded here for Regular Can- 
ons of the order of St. Augustin, by St. Tigernach, who was of the Blood Royal. 
He removed the Episcopal seat from Clogher to this place. In his old age he lost 
his sight, and dying of the plague, on the 4th of April, A. D. 548, was interred 
here. The Manor of this abbey is, at this day, called the Manor of St. Tierney, 
which, at the suppression, was granted, with the abbey, to Sir Henry Duke, 
Knight, one of whose daughters afterwards married Sir Francis Ruishe. It isnow 
the property of The Rt. Hon. Thomas Lord Dacre. There is still remaining here 
one of the ancient Round towers, and the foundation of the church, with the walls 
of a curious little chapel adjoining. At the upper end of the town is one of 
those Raths, vulgarly called Danish Forts, of a considerable size and flat on the 
top, and near to its basis another, which is rather broader at the bottom and top, 
but not near so high. The Corbeship in this town was in the nature of a Col- 
legiate Church, and during the rebellion, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, Mac 
Mahon procured from the Pope a grant of this Corbeship for his eldest son, who 
was then a boy.&quot; Archdalfs Monast. Hibern. pp. 582. ct set].

of May, 12th of August, and a2d of November. The parishes in the Union of 
Clonfert are contiguous ; and contain, according to the Down Survey, 17,147 
acres, but in reality many more. It is situate near the River Shannon. According 
to the Ecclesiastical Report, &quot; many new arrangements of parishes, highly advan- 
tageous and conducive to the establishment of the Protestant Church, might ob- 
viously be made in the Diocese of Clonfert, were the Government to extend to it 



C L O 

the same policy under which it has been pleased at different periods to regulate, 
I believe, every other Diocese in Ireland : namely, to enable the Bishop, by grant- 
ing him a compensation, to restore the Quarto, Pars (or, certain portions of Tythe 
due out of different parishes), or rather grant them (all Tythes being originally the 
property of the Diocesan) to the officiating Parochial Incumbents. Of such a 
measure, the first result would be to release the Diocesan from the necessity of 
employing a Tythe Proctor; or, as it happens in some cases, where the Incum- 
bent wishes to become tenant to the Quarta Pars, from trafficking with one of 
his clergy for a property not unimportant to either. In the hands of the Incum- 
bent, these portions would individually increase much in value: their dispartition 
would lay a reasonable foundation for the dissolution of several of the present 
Unions: new churches and additional Incumbents might follow ; a competency 
\vould be established for general residence, and a single Manse House would no 
longer remain the opprobrium of the union of two not inconsiderable Sees. In 
the instance of three Benefices, viz., Cloiifert, Donanaghta, and Kiltormer, I have 
the best authority to assert that these three Benefices would afford equal, if not 
superior incomes to six Clergymen : and three additional churches might be 
built in situations not remote from any church, if the respective native tythes of 
each parish were relinquished by the Diocesan, and conferred upon the Incum- 
bent. In respect to the parish of Clonfert, upon any dissolution of the Union, I 
conceive it might be adviseable to constitute it part of the Corps of the Deanery 
of Clonfert, which Dignitary is at present without cure of souls, in order to induce 
the Dean to reside at Clonfcrt : where, from the solitude of the situation, and un- 
civilization of the lower orders of people, such an association to the residence of the 
Ordinary might prove very beneficial to the cause of religion and morality.&quot; How 
sensible, and judicious! The Right Rev. Christopher Butson, D. D., Lord Bishop, in 
1806. The Bishoprick of Clonfert (valued in the King&apos;s Books at ot&apos;24. sterling) 
was founded, according to Dr. Beaufort, near the close of the Sixth century; and 
the See of Kilmacduagh, in the beginning of the Seventh. They were united in 
1602. Clonfert lies chiefly in the county of Gal way ; a small part only of Roscommon 
belongs to it, with a single parish, on the East of the Shannon, in the King&apos;s County. 
The greatest length of this Diocese is 29 miles, and the greatest breadth 25 miles. 
Kilmacduagh is wholly in Galway, and measures 18 by 12 miles. The extent of 
the Union is about 37 by 25 miles. The Members of the Chapter of Clonfert are a 
Dean, an Archdeacon, a Sacrist, and 8 Prebendaries. The Cathedral and parish 
church of Clonfcrt are the same : near them stands the Bishop&apos;s Palace ; there 
not being one at Clonfert, which is distant 21 miles from the farthest part of the 
Diocese, and 34 from the western extremity of the Union. &quot; St. Brendan, the 
son of Findloga, studied under St. Finian in the Academy of Clonard, and A. D. 553 
or 56&quot;2, he founded an Abbey here, under the Invocation of the Virgin Mary. St. 



C L O 

Brendan was the founder of many other abbies, and is said to have presided over 
3000 Monks, each of whom did industriously earn a sufficiency for his support ; 
this Saint instituted a particular form or rule for the observance of his successors, 
who, in the course of time, followed that of St. Augustin.&quot; Archdalts Monast.

C L O 

is in the Diocese of Meatli, and Province of Armagh. It is 8 m. S. from Athlone. 
It is situate on the East bank of the River Shannon. The Fair is holden on the 
20th of September. It is occasionally called Seven Churches. In the old Dio- 
cese of Clonmacknois, united to Meath in the year 1568, there is a Dean. (The 
Rev. Thomas V. Dawson, A.M., in 1806), but no other Dignitary or Prebendary. 
&quot;This monastery, which belonged to the Regular Canons of St. Augustin, was 
peculiarly and universally esteemed, it was uncommonly extensive, and amazingly 
enriched by various Kings and Princes. Its landed property was so great, and 
the number of cells and monasteries subjected to it so numerous, that almost half 
of Ireland was said to be within the bounds of Clonmacnoise. And what was a 
strong inducement, and contributed much towards enriching this house, it was 
believed, that all persons who were interred in the holy ground belonging to it. 
had insured to themselves a sure and immediate ascent to Heaven; many princes 
(it is supposed for this reason) chose this for the place of their sepulture; it was 
the Jonaof Ireland. Yet notwithstanding the reputed sanctity of this monastery, 
and the high estimation in which it was holden by all ranks of people, it appears, 
that the abbey and town were frequently plundered, burnt and destroyed by de- 
spoilers of every kind, from the unpolished Irish desperado, to the empurpled 
King. The abbey also suffered by the hands of the barbarous Ostmen, and not 
only by them, but (with concern do we add) by the English then settled in the 
kingdom, whose errand hither, we would wish to think, was to conciliate the 
affections of the people, to unite them in bonds of friendship, and teach thefh to 
live like fellow citizens and subjects; instead of this, we are compelled to say, 
they too often joined in the sacrilegious outrages of other wicked men, and re- 
peatedly disturbed and despoiled the peaceful seminary of Clonmacnoise; sparing 
neither book, vestment, or any other appendage of the sacred altar, which be- 
longed to these truly inoffensive men. The situation of Clonmacnoise is delight- 
ful. It stands about ten miles from Athlone, on the banks of the Shannon, and is 
raised above the river on ground composed of many small elevations, on which are 
a few of the buildings which did belong to this ancient house. Several other ruins 
appertaining to it may also be seen in the little vallies between the hills. The 
whole is bounded to the East and North with very large bogs. Here are two 
Round towers, elegantly built of hewn stone; the larger, which is called O&apos;Rourk&apos;s, 
and wants the roof, is 62 feet in height, and 56 in circumference, and the walls 
are three feet eight inches in thickness. The other Tower, called Mac Carthy&apos;s, 
is seven feet in diameter within, and the walls are three in thickness, and 56 in 
height, including the conical shaped roof. The next considerable building we 
find here, is the Cathedral, which was the ancient abbey (founded, in the year 548, 
by St. Kieran) the doors of it are richly carved. There are several old monuments 
in this church, on which are inscriptions, said to be partly in Hebrew and partly 
in Irish. At length this abbey, which was formerly endowed with very large 



C L O 

possessions, suffered a gradual decline, and in the course of time was reduced and 
despoiled of all its property. The cemetery contained about two Irish acres, on 
which ten other churches were afterwards built by the Kings and petty Princes of 
the circumjacent country, who, though at perpetual war whilst living, were con- 
tent to rest peaceably beside each other. The several founders named these 
churches as follows: Temple High, or Melaghlins Church, built by O&apos;Melaghlin, 
King of Meath, and to this day it is the burial-place of that family ; Temple O&apos;Con- 
nor, built by O&apos;Connor Dun ; Temple Kelly ; Temple Finian, or Mac Carthy, 
built by Mac Carthy-more of Munster; Temple Hurpan, or Mac Laffy&apos;s Church; 
Temple Kieran ; Temple Gauney ; Temple Doulin, which is now the parish church ; 
and Temple Mac Dermot ; this last was much larger than any of the others, and 
before the West door stands a large old cross of one entire stone, much defaced 
by time, on which was some rude carving, and an inscription in antique and un- 
known characters : the North doors are very low, but guarded with small pillars 
of fine marble, curiously hewn. Another of these churches hath within it an arch 
of greenish marble, flat wrought, and beautifully executed, the joints of which are 
so close, that the whole appears to be of one entire stone. Besides the cross 
before mentioned, there are three others in the church-yard. Here we also find 
Temple Easpic, or The Bishop&apos;s Chapel, and on the West of the cemetery lie some 
ruins of the Episcopal Palace, which may still be seen. The 9th of September is 
annually observed as the patron day, when great numbers from the most distant 
parts of Ireland, assemble here in pilgrimage. A Religious House for nuns 
appears to have been founded here early.&quot; ArchdalCs Monast. Hibern. pp. 379-

cumbent (in 1806), who has cure of souls, is resident, and discharges the duties 
in person, assisted by his Curate, The Rev. Thomas Stanestreet, at a Salary of 
50. per annum. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, it appears, that Temple 
Robin might be separated from Clonmell, and each would provide maintenance 
for an Incumbent; but the Union being by Act of Council, it is not in the 
Bishop&apos;s power to dissolve it by his own authority. Clonmell is in the Diocese 
of Cloyne, and Province of Cashel. It is adjacent to Cove, on the West. The 
parishes of Clonmell, and Temple Robin, are contiguous ; their extent being 5 
miles from North to South, and 2 miles from East to West. See, Lisgoold.

are holden. This Town sends one Member to Parliament: Patron, Lord Mount- 
cashel. It is governed by a Mayor, Sheriff, Recorder, two Bailiffs, and a Town 
Clerk. The Right Hon. John Scott, Chief Justice of His Majesty&apos;s Court of 
King&apos;s Bench in Ireland, was created Earl of Clonmell, in 1793- It is situate on 
the navigable River Suir, over which there is a bridge of 20 arches, divided into 
two parts by a small Island in the River, on which houses are built: the tide flows 
a little way above the town. Here is a Charter School, for 60 boys. It gave birth 
(on the 24th of November 1713) to The Rev. Laurence Sterne, the celebrated au- 
thor of Tristram Shandy. This town is very ancient, having been erected before 
the invasion of the Danes ; it was formerly defended by a strong wall. Oliver 
Cromwell met with greater resistance here, than in any other part of the kingdom : 
he demolished the Castles and Fortifications, of which now only the ruins remain. 



C L O 

The parishes in this Union are contiguous; their extent being very great. Ac- 
cording to the Ecclesiastical Report, the entire Rectory of Clomnell, and the Vic- 
arage of Kilgrant, ought to be perpetually united. Kilgrant would be of too 
small value to stand alone. John Bagwell, Esq., is the Patron of the entire Rectory 
of Clonmell; and the Crown is the Patron of the Vicarage of Kilgrant. &quot;A Do- 
minican Friary was founded here, A. D. 1269, and dedicated to&apos; St. Dominick. We 
can not trace the founder of this monastery : But the Franciscan Friary owed its 
origin, in 1269, to Otho de Grandison, although some writers erroneously give it to 
the inhabitants of the town; and others, with as little certainty, make the family 
of Fitzgerald the founders. The church of the friary was truly magnificent, and 
esteemed one of the finest in Ireland; in this church was a miraculous image of St. 
Francis. It is now the meeting-house of a Dissenting Congregation.&quot; Arch- 
dall&apos;s Hfonast. Hibern. p. 652.

Chaplains. The Military Officers arc a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Town 
Major. It is situate on the River Lee, and is esteemed the second city in Ireland. 
But now having a Royal Dock-yard near it, and other Military Arsenals ; to which 
being added the conveniences of its local situation, and the wealth and enterprize 
of its Inhabitants, its future progress is rendered incalculable. The Assizes are 
holden here. The Harbour of Cork is so formed, according to Dr.JBeaufort, as to 
contain an immense number of Ships, in complete security. And the banks of it, 
being adorned with Villas and Plantations, present a most agreeable and chearful 
Landscape. Vessels of one hundred and twenty tons go up to the City Qu:rys, 
but the large ships lie at Passage, ll r est, a few miles lower down. The mouth of 
the harbour is protected by Carlisle Fort, the date of whose construction is pointed 
out by the name. This City is the great Mart of the South of Ireland. The prin- 
cipal articles of its export trade are Beef and Butter, together with a great quan- 
tity of Corn, and some Linen. By those who are sensible of the happiness of 
friendship the author will be forgiven, for here recording the bravery of a Native of 
this City, WILLIAM PARKER, Esquire, late Commander of the Honourable East 
India Company&apos;s ship BRIDGEWATER. now resident at Camberwell, in the County 
of Surrey ; and whose ancestors have been uniformly as highly respected for their 
virtues, as for the important offices which they repeatedly filled in Cork. On the 
Sth of March 1779, Captain Parker being on his return from Bencoolen, fell in 



COR 

with the American Frigate CAMPDEN of 28 guns, and 300 men. The BRIDGE- 
WATER had 26 guns, and only 84 men, many of whom were sickly. The action 
commenced at 8 o&apos;Clock in the morning, and lasted three hours ; when the frigate 
sheered oflf with the loss of her captain and 19 seamen killed, and 25 wounded: 
there was also an American Schooner in company with the frigate, but being to 
leeward, and it blowing fresh, she could not get into action. For such a masterly 
defence of his ship, and against such a very unequal force, it was &quot; RESOLVED, at a 
Court of Directors held on Thursday the 10th of June 1779, that in consideration 
of the gallant defence made by the Officers and Seamen of the ship Bridgewater, 
against an American Ship of War of superior force, which after an engagement 
of some hours was obliged to sheer off, a gratuity of Two thousand pounds, be paid 
to the said Officers and Seamen, in such proportion as shall be settled by the Com- 
mittee of shipping. That Captain Parker do receive the Thanks of this Court for 
his gallant conduct, and that he be presented with a piece of plate of One hundred 
guineas value, with the Company&apos;s Anns engraved thereon.&quot; And from which this 
Inscription is taken. There is a peculiar satisfaction in bearing due testimony to 
merit! The Hon. and Right Rev. Thomas St. Laurence, D. D., Lord Bishop, ia 
1807. The foundation of the Bishoprick of Cork is placed in the Seventh century: 
That of Ross is unknown; they were united by Queen Elizabeth, in 1586: They 
are both contained in the county of Cork, and are partly intermixed. The Diocese 
of Cork is 58 miles long from Eas to West, and about 13 miles broad. The length 
of the principal part of Ross is 25 miles from East to West, and the breadth Smiles : 
the detached part of it, in the mountains of Bear and Bantry, is about the same 
length, but not more than four miles broad. Thewhole Union is about 65 miles 
by 17. The Clvapters of these Dioceses consist each of a Dean, a Precentor, 
a Chancellor, a Treasurer, and an Archdeacon ; there are besides 12 Prebendaries, 
in Cork, and 5, in Ross. The Cathedral of St. Finbarry is a plain modern church. 
Xear it stands the Bishop&apos;s Palace, a large new house, built but a few years, by 
the late Bishop, Dr. Mann. It is 50 miles from the city of Cork, to the remotest 
parts of Ross. &quot; St. Barr, Barroc, or Finbar, but by his parents named Lochan&apos;, 
was of the race of the Ibriunratha ; he flourished about the year 600, and built an 
Abbey, which, after time, was called The Abbey of St. Barr, or Finbar; this found- 
ation is by some placed, A. D. 606. This abbey was founded near Lough-eirc; 
which is generally supposed to be that particular hollow in which a great part of 
the city of Cork stands. St. Barr died at Cloyne, but was interred in his own 
church, where his bones were afterwards deposited in a silver Shrine: his Fes- 
tival is holden on the 25th of September. In 1 134, this abbey was refounded, for 
Regular Canons following the rule of St. Augustine, under the Invocation- of St. 
John the Baptist, by Cormac, King of Minister, or, as some write, King of Desmond. 
The Monks of this abbey erected the first Salmon Wiers on the River Lee, near 
the city of Cork. The remains of this building were totally demolished .about 
the year 1745. Dennot Mac Carthy Reagh founded a Monastery, A. D. 1214, 



COT 

for Conventual Franciscans, and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary. This building, 
which stood on the North side of the city, is now entirely demolished. The 
Dominican Friary, called The Abbey of St. Mary of the Island, was founded in 
the year 1229. This house, which stood in an Island, called Cross-Green, on the 
south side of the town, is now entirely demolished. A Monastery was founded, 
on the South side of the city, in the reign of King Edward the First for Friars 
following the Rule of St. Augustine. Of this building, the steeple, which is 64 
feet high, and the walls of the church, still remain ; the East window, the only 
one in the choir, was truly magnificent, and measured 30 feet in height and 15 
in breadth ; the whole erection was converted into a sugar-house, and is now 
called, The Red Abbey&apos;. Dr. Bourke is the only author, who mentions the house 
for White Friars. The Nunnery of St. John the Baptist, of which there are now 
no remains, was situated near the present market-house, and the site was 
accidentally discoveredin digging up some old tombs. There was a Preceptory of 
the Knights Templars in this town, for we find that William le Chaplain was 
Master of Cork about the 1292. The Priory of St. Stephen was founded in 
the South suburbs of this city for the support of Lepers, and Edward Henry was 
keeper of it, A. D. 1295. This priory, .when suppressed, was granted to the city 
of Cork, and about the year 16?4, an hospital for poor children, now called, The 
Blue Coat Hospital, was erected on the ancient sheS&apos;Archdairs Monast. Hibern.

largest is called The Island of St. Dabeoc, some call it St. Fintan&apos;s Island, and others 
the Island of Saints. In this Island was a Priory of Canons Regular following the 
Rule of St. Augustin, which was dedicated to the Saints Peter and Paul, and 



D E R 

founded, as some say, by the great Apostle of Ireland, but others give the found- 
ation to St. Dabeoc, who was also called Mobeoc and Beonan ; he was brother to 
St. Canoe, who flourished about the year 492. St. Dabeoc is Patron of this church, 
where three Festivals are holden to his honour&apos;yearly, on the 1st of January, 24th 
of July, and 16th of December. St. Dabeoc is said to have been buried in this 
abbey, which he made subject to the great Abbey of Armagh. It had a new 
Chapel, witli convenient houses for the Monks, the remains of which may yet be 
seen. One of the Saint Patricks was Prior here about the year 850. Notwith- 
standing the reputed holiness of this celebrated monastery, it was plundered and 
reduced to ashes by Bratachas O&apos;Boyle and Mac Mahon. A. D. 1207. John was 
Prior, in 1353. St. Patrick&apos;s Purgatory, as it is called, was first fixed in this Isl- 
and, but it being near to the shore, and a bridge from the main-land giving the peo- 
ple a free and easy access into it, the cave was closed up, and another was opened 
in a lesser Island, about half a mile from the shore. Some people have given the 
invention of this purgatory to the great St. Patrick, but others, with more proba- 
bility, ascribe it to Patrick who was Prior here about the year 850. This pur- 
gatory continued a long time in high repute both at home and abroad. We find, 
in our records, several safe conducts granted by the Kings of England to for- 
eigners desirous to visit it, and particularly in the year 1358, to Maletesta Un- 
garus, Knt. ; another bearing the same date, to Nicholas de Beccario, a Nobleman 
of Ferraria ; and, in 1397, one to Raymond, Viscount de Perilleux and Knight of 
Rhodes, with a train of 20 Men and 30 Horses. But this purgatory must have 
fallen afterwards into disrepute, for we find, that by the authority of the Pope, 
Alexander VI (he having considered the same in the light of imposition), it was 
demolished on St. Patrick&apos;s Day, in the the year 1497, by the Father Guardian 
of the Franciscans of Donegal, and some other persons of the Deanery, of Lough- 
ern, who were deputed for this purpose by the Bishop. A Canon of the priory of 
St. Dabeoc usually resided on the Island, for the service of the church and pil- 
grims. The extent of this island is scarcely three quarters of an Irish acre ; the 
Cave of the purgatory is built of free-stone, and covered with broad flags and 
green turf laid over them ; in length, within the walls, it measures sixteen feet 
and an half, and in breadth, about two feet and an inch; when the door is shut, 
no light can be discovered, save what enters at a small window in the corner. In 
1630, the government of Ireland thought fit to have it finally suppressed, and it 
was accordingly dug up, to the no small distress and loss of the Roman Catholic 
C\ci^y. n ArchdairsMonaat. Hibern. p. 102. It is said to have been called formerly

D IN 

of Conought. He was also Abbot of Inbernaile, in the county of Donegal, and of 
Kilnaille in Breffmia. This abbey was a large and curious building, and the 
workmanship remarkably good: to the East of it stands a beautiful Round towen 
76 feet high, and 41 in circumference: the walls, which are three feet thick, are 
built of hewn stone, each stone about a foot square, within and without, and with 
scarcely any cement or mortar: the roof is in the form of a cone, and of the 
same materials, and finished with one large stone, shaped like a bell : with four 
windows (.and the form of a man&apos;s face over each) near the top, and opposite to 
the cardinal points: the door is nine feet from the ground; the inside of the 
building is nearly as smooth as the barrel of a gun, and on the outside, at the base, 
a circle of stone projects five inches. The church, which is the most easterly 
building, was large and beautiful, with a noble carved window over the High 
Altar : next to this window, to the right, about ten feet from the ground, is the 
following Inscription, the letters and points of which are raised; 

Matheus O&apos;Dubagan hoc opus fecit Bartholomeo 
O&apos;Flannagan priori de Daminis. A. D. 14 19. 

Round this Inscription is a frame, somewhat raised, with another inscription on it, 
which is now illegible. Next to the tower is a vaulted building of hewn stone, 
which ends in a point, and is called St. Molaise&apos;s House ; near to this is his bed, in 
the shape of a stone coffin, in which he used to pray. The neighbouring inhabit- 
ants say, that pains in the back are relieved by lying in this bed. There appears 
to have been many ancient inscriptions here, but they are all erased and destroyed 
by time. In the interpolations of the Ulster Annals, at the year 1130, we read, 
that the monastery of Daminis was founded that year. The author must mean 
either the repairing of the ancient monastery of St. Laserian, or the founding of the 
Priory of the Colidei, or Secular Priests here.&quot; Archdalfs Monast. Hibern.

The Prior of this house sat as a Baron in Parliament. The priory stands near the 
town, on the ascent of a hill, anil is yet venerable, though in ruins : the roof was 
supported by five handsome arches, which composed a centre aisle of twenty-six 
feet in breadth, two lateral ones of thirteen feet each, and the whole structure is 
one hundred feet long. The heads of the pillars and arches, the tops of the win- 
dows, and many niches in the walls, were adorned with variety of Sculptures, 
some parts of which yet remain. At the East end is a very lofty and magnificent 
window, and over it are three handsome niches, in which niches the pedestals, 
whereon stood the Saints Patrick, Columb, and Brigid, still remain. Adjoining 
the East end of the church are two square columns, in one of which was a wind- 
ing staircase, leading to the roof. At the West end is a very high pillar, (lately 
taken down, in order to enlarge the West end of the Cathedral, and under the 
foundations of which, the vestiges of a more ancient Church were discovered): 
Several cells have been discovered behind the abbey,, one of which was floored 
with a Mosaic Work, but in a coarse and inelegant manner. The Priory of Reg-

any account of it. An Abbey of Cistertian Nuns is said to have been in this town. 
The Franciscan Friary, which was founded about the year 1240, by Hugh de 
Lacie, Earl of Ulster, is said, by other Avriters, to owe its foundation to Africa, 
daughter of Godred, King of Man, and wife to Sir John de Courcey; it passed to 
the Friars of the Strict Observance, in the time of Thomas Mac Cominde, warden,

Dromore, which is in the gift of the Crown, is valued in the King&apos;s Books at l6. 
sterling : it is a Sine Cure, there being no Cathedral establishment, or Choir ; and 
no Deanery House, or Land : The Rev. Raphael Walsh, the Dean (in 1 806), who is 
absent with the Bishop&apos;s entire approbation. According to the Diocesan Report, 
it appears, that the number of Roman Catholicks in this Diocese bear so small a 
proportion to that of the Protestants, that, in several parishes, the latter are more 
than ten to one. In one of these parishes, it was found, on an enumeration, that 
amidst more than 3000 families, there was but one of Roman Catholicks. The 
Foundation of this Diocese (valued in the King&apos;s Books at ,50. sterling) is ascribed, 
according to Dr. Beaufort, to St. Colman in the Sixth century. It is extremely 
compact, and the smallest in extent of any Bishoprick in the kingdom, which is 
not annexed to another See; extending only 28 miles from North to South, and 
17 miles from East to West. Yet it comprehends some part of three Counties. 
The Chapter of this Diocese, which was new modeled and established, with some 
peculiar privileges, by patent of James I., is composed of a Dean, Precentor (see, 
Magherallti), Chancellor (see, Clonallen), Treasurer, Archdeacon (see, Donough- 
cloney}, and one Prebendary. The Lordship of Newry claims the same exemption 
from Episcopal jurisdiction; to which it was entitled when it appertained to a 
monastery, before the Reformation. And the Proprietor of the Lordship (Mr. 
Needham) exercises the jurisdiction in his peculiar court, granting marriage 
licenses, probates to wills,&amp;c., under the old monkish seal. The Cathedral of 
Dromore is very small ; but the Bishops house which was erected a few years ago 
by Dr, Beresford, is a handsome and convenient residence, near the town ; And 
not 20 miles distant from any part of the Diocese. &quot; It takes its name from its 
situation, being built on the side of an Hill, and owes its origin to St. Colman. 
An Abbey of Regular Canons was founded here by the same Saint, called also 
Mocholmoc, he was a disciple of Mac Nissy, Bishop of Connor, who died A. D. 
513 ; St. Colman&apos;s Festival is observed on the 7th of June. From Dr. Bourke we 
learn, that a monastery was founded here for Friars of the order of St. Francis ;

Dublin is in the Dioceses of Dublin and Glandelagh, and Province of Dublin. 
The Right Hon. and Most Reverend Euseby Cleaver, D. D., Archbishop of 
Dublin, and Lord Primate of Ireland, in 1809. It is in the Latitude of 55.. 21&apos;.. 2&quot; 
North, and the Longitude of 6.. 15&apos;\Vest from the Meridian of Greenwich. ThisCity 
returns two Members to Parliament ; the Electors being, Freemen and Freeholders. 
TheUNivEKSiTY, being- a Borough in itself, returns also one Member; the Election 
being in, The Fellows and Scholars. It is called Eblana Civitas by Ptolomey. 
According to Dr. Beaufort, it is impossible to give even an adequate Sketch of the 



DUB 

City of Dublin in a short tract ; but it would be unpardonable to omit some of 
its principal features. It extends above two rniles in every direction, and is rapidly 
increasing in size, opulence, and beauty. The River Liffey, which passes through 
its centre, is crossed by six Bridges, one of which is of great elegance. The 
Harbour is defended from the inclemency of the winds and waves by a strong 
mole or wall, extending nearly four miles in length, and terminating with a 
Light-house, which is erected about a mile from the Eastern and adjacent to the 
Southern bar. Corresponding to this handsome and useful Pharos, there stands 
on the Promontory of Hoath, which forms the North side of the Bay, another 
very complete Light-house. The vast number of country-houses, and neat villages, 
which cover the shores of the Bay, the varied and undulating summits of the 
Wicklow Mountains in the southern back-ground, and the prospect of the City 
at the West end, compose one of the grandest scenes that can be imagined. Of 
the many Public Edifices that adorn it, the most remarkable are, THE CASTLE, 
which stands nearly in the middle of the city, and is the residence of the Vice- 
roy, THE PARLIAMENT-HOUSE; THEUNIVERSITV, THE ROYAL EXCHANGE, 
and THE CUSTOM-HOUSE ; all buildings of great magnificence. THE COURTS of 
JUSTICE are almost finished in the same style, THE LINEN HALL, THE BAR- 
RACKS, HOSPITALS for Invalids, for the children of sailors and of soldiers, for 
the education of youth, and for the reception of the aged and infirm of various 
descriptions are too numerous to mention separately. THE ROYAL IRISH 
ACADEMY was incorporated in 1786. THE DUBLIN SOCIETY, for the improvement 
of agriculture and useful arts, which was incorporated so early as the year 1749, 
has truly answered the end of its institution, by promoting objects of the utmost 
importance to Ireland. Two Canals are begun on the opposite sides of the river, 
with which they are immediately to communicate. The Southern Navigation 
extends upwards of forty miles, to the River Barrow, which is navigable ; and a 
branch of this canal is carried on in a western direction towards the Shannon. 
The Northern Canal has also communication with that great River in the County 
of Longford, and, by a collateral Cut unites with the Boyne navigation. To the 
West end of the town adjoins THE PHOZNIX PARK, a Royal Demesne of great 
beauty, which extends above two miles in length, and a mile and an half in 
breadth, on the North side of the Liffey. The Corporation of this City consists 
of a Lord Mayor, Recorder, 24 Aldermen (all of whom are Justices of the Peace), 
two Sheriffs, a Common Council, and other Officers. It is almost needless to say, 
that most branches of commerce and every kind of trade are exercised in Dublin, 
and that the city is daily advancing in wealth and industry. The first mention, 
which we find of the See of Dublin, is in the Seventh century. In the year 1 152 
it was erected into an Archbishoprick, which is valued in the King&apos;s Books at 
534,.. 15..%% Irish Money : And, in 114, the Bishoprick of Glandelagh, which 
had been founded in the Sixth century, was incorporated with Dublin. It is 50 



D u B 

miles in length, from North to South, and 36 miles in the greatest breadth ; con- 
taining the whole county of Dublin, the most of Wicklow, and part of two other 
counties, The Chapter of ST. PATRICK&apos;S, Dublin, consists of the Dean (who is 
elective by the Archbishop and Chapter), the Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, two 
Archdeacons, of Dublin and Glandelagh, and nineteen Prebendaries. The Members 
of the Collegiate Chapter of CHRIST CHURCH are the Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, 
Treasurer, the Archdeacon of Dublin, and three Prebendaries : This Deanery is 
annexed to the Bishoprick of Kildare. The Cathedral of St. Patrick is a large 
and venerable Pile ; and the Archbishop&apos;s Palace is a very antique building. His 
Grace has also a small Country Residence at Talkgh, of no very modern date. 
The most remote part of the Dioeese is thirty four miles from Dublin. The 
General Post-office was established by Act of Parliament, on the 1st of August 
1784: The present Post-Masters General (in 1810) are The Right Hon. Earl O&apos;Neil, 
and The Right Hon, the Earl of Ross : The Secretaries are Sir John Lees, Bart., 
and Edward S. Lees, Esq. There are six Packets between Dublin and Holyhead^ 
and two Packet Wherries. The Mails for England leave Dublin every evening, 
except Sunday, and are due in Dublin every day, except Wednesday. &quot; The 
celebrated Religious Foundation of the Abbey of the Virgin Mary owes its origin 
to the Danes, about the year 948&gt;immediately after their conversion to Christianity; 
although others fondly ascribe it to some of our Irish princes. At the first it was 
of the Benedictine Order, then the most celebrated in the Western world. In 
1139, it was granted to the Monks of the Cistertian order. On the 27th of May, 
1304, this beautiful and noble abbey, with the church and steeple, were destroyed 
by fire : At this time it was the Repository of the Rolls of Chancery, which 
were all consumed, to the 28th of King Edward the First, except two Rolls of 
that year. The Abbot had a Seat in Parliament as a Baron. By the testimony of 
a venerable Record, The Black Book of Christ Church, we are informed, that 
about the year of Our Lord 1038, Sitric, the son of Ableb, or rather Aulif, the 
Danish Prince of Dublin, gave to Donat, Bishop of that See, a&gt;place, where the 
Arches or Vaults were founded, to erect a Church to the honour of The Blessed 
Trinity. Donat built an Episcopal Palace contiguous to the church. The 
Religious of this Community were Secular Canons, not tied to the observance of 
strict monastic rules, or belonging to any of the Cenobitical Orders : yet 
they were a sort of Monks lax in discipline, and bound to such regulations 
as the Bishop prescribed. On the advancement of Laurence OToole to the 
See of Dublin, in A. D. 1163, he made them Canons Regular of the Order of 
Arras, a branch of the Augustinians. On the llth of January 1283, certain of 
the Scotch Nation, to retaliate upon some of the citizens for doing them an injury, 
set Skinner-Row on fire, which communicating to this church, destroyed the 
steeple and chapter-house, with the dormitory and cloisters. It is recorded, to 
the honour of the citizens on this occasion, that they agreed to make a collection 



DUB 

sufficient for repairing the priory, before they would repair their own dwellings 
which had suffered by the fire. In the year 1300, a final and amicable agreement 
was made between the Prior and Canons of The Holy Trinity and the Dean 
and Chapter of St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral, which was strengthened by the Com- 
mon Seal of each Chapter. The principal heads of it were, That the Arch- 
bishop should be consecrated and enthroned in Christ Church; that each church 
should be called Cathedral and Metropolitical ; that Christ Church as being the 
greater, the mother, and the elder church, should have the precedence in all. rights 
and concerns of the church; that the cross, mitre, and ring of every Archbishop, 
in whatever place he died, should be deposited in Christ Church; and that each 
church should have their turn in the interment of the bodies of their Archbishop, 
unless otherwise ordered by their wills. In 1538, St. Patrick&apos;s Stpjf, that was 
brought hither from Armagh, as a relique of high estimation, was publicly com- 
mitted to the flames. The Prior of the Holy Trinity always sat as a Baron in 
Parliament. In 1541, King Henry the Eighth, by Letters Patent, dated the 10th 
of May, changed the Priory into a Dean and Chapter, confirming their ancient 
estates and immunities, and made Payneswick, who was the last Prior, the first 
Dean ; but it is to be remarked, that in some leases of lands, dated the 4th of Der 
cember 1540, he is named Dean. In the year 1 146, Dermot, the son of Murchard, 
King of Leinster, founded an Abbey, for Nuns following the Rule of St. Augustin, 
in a village called Tlogges, adjoining the East end of the City of Dublin, and near 
the present church of St. Andrew. No women were admitted into this house, 
till they were past the age of thirty years. It is supposed, that the Knights 
Templars had a Priory in a place, called Casgot, in the South suburbs of the 
city ; and that Walter de Fernsfield was a great benefactor to it. Probably this is 
the place, where now stands the palace of the Archbishop, in St. Kevin&apos;s Street. 
The Nunnery of St. Mary les Dames was situated without the East gate of the 
city, which from thence was called, The Gate of St. Mary les Dames, and the 
avenue leading from the Castle to the University acquired the name of Dame 
Street. In 148?, the person, called Lambert Simnell, being supported by divers 
of the Nobility, was crowned King in the Priory of The Holy Trinity, by the 
name of Edward; the crown made use of, on this occasion, was borrowed from 
the statue of the Blessed Virgin, which stood in the church of this Nunnery. 
King Henry the Second having granted the City of Dublin to a Colony from 
Bristol, they built the Abbey of St. Olave for such of their countrymen as should 
be inclined to embrace the order of St, Augustin, and called it from the abbey of 
the same order and name in their native town. Very little is known of the 
monastery of Witeschan. The Priory of All Hallows, or All Saints, was situated 
on Hoggin-Green, now called College-Green, and was founded about the year 
1 166, for Canons of the Order of Aroasia, by Diarmit, the son of Murchard, King 
of Leinster. In 15&lt;p, in Easter Holy days, the city, at the persuasion qf 



D L v L 

Archbishop Loftus, granted the priory for the founding of an University ; and&apos; 
the whole building, the steeple excepted, was for that purpose immediately 
demolished. The Abbey of St. Thomas was founded in that part of Dublin, no\v 
called Thomas Court, for Canons of the Congregation of St. Victor, by William 
Fitz Andelm, butler to King Henry the Second. The Priory of St. John the 
Baptist was situated in St. Thomas Street, without the West, or the New Gate, of 
the city. A Roman Catholic Chapel is erected on part of the site of this Priory;, 
the ancient steeple still remains. The Friary of St. Saviour, in Oslmantown, on 
the North bank of the River, near tbe old bridge, is now called The King&apos;s Inns. 
It was founded near the gieat bridge (on the place where stood the Chapel of 
St. Saviour), between the years 1202 and 1218, by William Mareschal the elder, 
Earl of Pembroke. The whole site was afterwards appropriated to the use of the 
lawyers, and is called The King&apos;s Inns, where a magnificent building is erected, 
which contains the Courts of Law, the Rolls, and all the other Public offices ap- 
pertaining thereto. The Monastery of St, Francis was built in the year 1235, upon 
a piece of ground given for that purpose by Ralph le Porter, and was situated in 
that part of the suburbs of the city, which is now called Francis Street, The 
Monastery of The Holy Trinity was founded about the year 1259, for Friars of 
the Order of St. Augustin, by one of the family of Talbpt. It was a very consid- 
erable foundation, and was the general College for all the Friars of that Order in 
Ireland. This monastery was situated on the ground whereon Crow Street, with 
a Theatre and other buildings, have been since erected The Carmelite Monastery, 
or White Friars, was built by Sir Robert Bagot, Knt., Chief Justice of the King&apos;s 
Bench, in the reign of King Edward the First, in the parish of St. Peter, in the 
&quot;South suburbs of the city. Very little mention is made of the Hospital of St. 
Stephen, which was situate in the South suburbs of the city ; and on the site 
whereof Mercer&apos;s Charitable Hospital has been erected. Henry Loundres, Arch- 
bishop of Dublin, about the year 1220, founded an Hospitaj, in honour of God and 
St. James, in a place, called The Steyne, near the city of Dublin. John Allen, 
Dean of the Cathedral of St. Patrick, in 1504, founded an Hospital for sick poor, 
to be chosen principally out of the families of Allen, Barret, Begge, Hill, Dillon, 
and Rodier, in the Dioceses of Meath and Dublin.&quot; ArchdalCs Monust. Hibern.

DUN 

nected with each other, in this district, are ten parishes, all Impropriate in The 
Marquess of Drogheda, and of which His Lordship is the Patron. A new distri- 
bution of them, with a view to form them into permanent Unions, would be 
highly expedient. As Episcopally united, they now intersect each other, and to 
procure residence is impracticable, as long as they continue Episcopally united or 
distinct, two years income of each separate parish being insufficient to build a 
Glebe House; but the Patron&apos;s consent, as the law now stands, is an essential 
preliminary. The Marquess of Urogheda formerly paid ?. per annum, for the 
Cure of Dulcek, but this His Lordship now withholds. The Income of Duleek is 
3. per annum, of Clonalvey 60., of Stamullin&lt;40., and of Dowth&lt;27. Total&lt;l50. Duleek is in the Diocese of Mea-th, and Province of Armagh. It is 20f m.

Clonalvey, and Stamullin, are contiguous : That of Dowth is separated from 
Duleek by the River Boyne.&quot; An Abbey was built here by St. Patrick, who 
placed St. Kienan, or Cienan over it, whom he had baptized in the year 450; 
And this Saint, after residing a considerable time in France, returned to Ireland, 
and erected a church of lime and stone here. The choir of the great church of 
St. Kieuan is now the parish church. We find, in a close Roll, &apos;29. Edward III, 
that a Priory was founded here for Regular Canons, by one of the family of 
O&apos;Kelly, long before the arrival of the English. There was also an Hospital here.&quot;

Killesk &quot; Harvey de Monte Maurisco, who was Seneschal of the whole estate 

belonging to Richard Earl of Pembroke, made a considerable grant of divers lands 
to St. Mary and St. Benedict, and to the Monks of the Abbey of Bildewas in 
Shropshire, England, for the purpose of erecting an Abbey here for Monks of the 
Cistertian order. This Charter was Avitnessed by Felix, who was consecrated 
Bishop of Ossory in the year 1 178. The Abbot sat as a Baron in Parliament. The 
ruins of this very extensive abbey exhibit an awful and picturesque scene. The 
interior walls of the church are nearly entire, as is the chancel, on each side of 
which (in the wings of the church) are three chapels, vaulted and groined ; the 
great aisle is divided into three parts by a double row of arches, supported by 
square piers; the inside of those arches have a molding which springs from beau- 
tiful consoles : The tower, rather low in proportion to the rest of the building, is 
supported by a grand arch ; the cloisters appear to have been spacious, but their 
foundations alone remain : some other ruinous walls indicate where the Hall, the 
Refectory, the Dormitory,&amp;c., stood. The West window of an uncommon form, 
is entire, and the door immediately beneath it was very magnificent, being adorned 
with filigree open-work, cut in the stone, and so raised as to allow a finger easily

of the Saint, Assicus introduced here a celebrated College of Monks, and presided

F E A 

figure of a man in armour rudely engraven thereon, his hands in a praying posture, 
and a dog at his feet ; by his side was originally the figure of his wife, with an 
inscription on the cushion, which lay under her head ; but this part of the tomb, 
now going to decay, is broken in two pieces, and the inscription rendered illegible 
by time : this tomb is said to belong to the family of Fitzpatrick. Near to it, is 
another tomb, which appears to be a woman, with a singular head-dress, rising up 
on each side, as Bishop Pococke describes it, in two horns. In the East wall is a 
small figure of Our Saviour, very inelegantly executed : and a few yards west of 
the chapel stands a Round tower, much decayed, being cracked quite up from the 
door, and wanting the top : it is about 48 feet in circumference, and the wall is 
three feet eight inches thick ; the door, which is six feet by two, and ten from 
the ground, faces the East ; the inside is divided into five stories, at each of which 
is a resting place, formed by the wall, sufficient to support a floor, and diminishing

attempted to erect this church, an evil spirit destroyed by night what the Saint 
built by day ; they also show a line engraven. about the middle of the East gable, 
which reaches from South to North ; and on the North side, about twelve feet 
from the ground, is also engraven an ugly figure in the wall, with part of the line 
in its mouth. This place was celebrated, in former ages, for its Divinity School,

ing the King&apos;s Patent, the Earl of Mountrath, the Patron, has continued to pre- 
sent to it, as to the sole Vicarage of Fircall. The last Institution Avas on the 
21st of June, 1796. It is evident, that it should be disunited, as it would make 
excellent provision for at least four Resident Vicars ; but the Patron must con- 
sent to the disunion: four Churches, viz., one in Balliboy, in tolerable repair; 
one in Lynally, in indifferent repair; one in Raghan, in good repair; and one in 
Eglish, in good repair also: a conditional Grant has been made by the Board of

ishioners; but the Patron not giving his consent, no application could be made for

GALWAY, within the Liberties of the same, Co. of GALWAY, and Province

Killcommon, Moycullin, Oranmore, Rahoon, and Shrule : one Church, in the 
town of Galway, in very good repair, and known by the name of The Collegiate 
Church of St. Nicholas, Galway : no church in any of the other parishes ; but 
money has been lately granted by the Board of First Fruits for building a church 
in the parish of Killcommon : no Glebe House, or Glebe land : The Rev. Ralph 
Daly, appointed Warden under the Charter of the Corporation of Galway, is 
non-resident (in 1806), and has cure of souls of all these parishes: The duty in 
Galway is performed by two Resident Vicars thereof, who are elected annually 
under the Charter. The Warden has been always entitled to the Tythes and 
Emoluments of the parish of St. Nicholas, and to the three-fourth parts of the 
Tythes of the remainder of the said parishes. The right of Presentation to the 
remaining one fourth of the Tythes of the said parishes, belongs to the Archbishop 



GAL 

of Tuam and his successors, in free disposal. The Warden and Vicars of Gal way claim; 
an exemption from any jurisdiction of the Archbishop, except visiting. The Rev.

of the Tythes of the parish of Shrule; and the said several possessors have cure 
of souls of their said respective parishes, but are not resident. The quarter 
parts of the Tythes of these parishes are totally inadequate to afford the means 
of comfort to the respective possessors thereof. These parishes are not contig- 
uous; their extent is computed to be 4 miles by 17. Galway is in the Diocese 
of Tuam, and Province ofTuam. It is 103 m. W. b. S. from Dublin. The Fairs 
are holden on the 4th of September, and at the East Gate, on the 31st of May, 
21st of September, and 21st of October. It is advantageously situate for com- 
merce, on a Bay to which it gives name, on the Atlantic Ocean ; and is the 
Capital of the County. This town sends one Member to Parliament. The 
Magistrates are a Mayor, two Sheriffs, a Recorder, Warden, and Tov/n Clerk. It 
hath also a Military Governor, and Town Major. It gives title of Viscount to the 
family of Monition. It has six Post-days in the week. &quot; A. D. 1296, Sir William 
de Burgh, surnamed Leigh, or The Grey, founded a Monastery for Franciscan 
Friars in St. Stephen&apos;s Island, situated without the North gate of the town, as 
it is particularly mentioned in the Obituary of the said Friary, and the dedication 
of it was on the 16th of May. Sir William died on the 12th of February, A. D. 
1324, and was interred here. The tomb of the founder, Sir William de Burgh, 
was discovered in June 1779, upwards of four feet under ground, with his family 
arms, and a very long broad sword elegantly carved thereon. Some remains of this 
Friary are still to be seen. Near the West Gate of the town, without the walls, 
was the Monastery of St. Mary of the Hill, a daughter to that of The Holy 
Trinity of the Premonstratenses of Tuam. On the Nuns forsaking it, the Secular 
Clergy entered into and kept possession for a considerable time, but on the pe- 
tition of the inhabitants of the Town to Pope Innocent VIII, it was granted to 
the Dominican Friars, by a Bull dated the 4th of December, 1488. There are no 
remains of this foundation save the cemetery, the whole building having been de- 
molished by the Townsmen in the year \65&lt;2, in order to prevent Oliver Crom- 
well from turning it into a fortification against themselves. The Augustinian 
Friary was founded on a Hill near this town, by Stephen Lynch, son of Dom- 
inick Duff (who was many times Mayor of Galway) and Margaret his wife, in 
the year 1508, at the earnest solicitation of Richard Nangle, a Friar of the 
same order, who afterwards became Archbishop of Tuam. A Carmelite Friary 
4 



GAR 

is said to have been founded here by one of the Burghs. We cannot learn any 
other account of it. A Nunnery was situated in an island in Lough Corrib, to

GIANTS CAUSEWAY, in the Barony of ^ary, Co. of ANTRIM, and Prov-

Giant&apos;s Causewav is taken from a communication of The Rev. Richard Pocock, 



G I A 

LL. D., to.Xhe Royal Society of London, and inserted in the Philosophical 
Transactions, vol. 48. part 1. pp. 226. et seq. &quot; In a Letter, which I wrote in 
1747 to Martin Folkes, Esq., President of The Royal Society, which was 
read in January, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for that month, 
I observed, in relation to the Giant&apos;s Causeway, that there appeared in the 
Sea-Cliffs three strata of Pillars between 30 and 40 feet high, with strata of a 
black Rock between them ; that the Causeway itself was the lowest of all 
these, extending in a point into the sea; and that another is seen towards the 
top of the Cliff. Last summer I took another view of it ; I went from Bally- 
Castle, which is about 10 miles to the East of the Causeway. When I came two 
miles to the West of Bally-Castle, within less than a mile of Ballintoy, half a mile 
to the South of the Sea-cliffs, and about a quarter to the South of the road, I saw 
the same kind of Pillars in a low hill ; I observed both Hexagons and Pentagons. 
The Rocks towards the sea appeared as if they were formed in the same manner ; 
but when I came to them, I found it was only common rock in several strata, and 
perpendicular joints. I went on about two miles to a Peninsula, called Don- 
severik, where I saw some tendency iu the rock towards this work of nature; and 
going about half a mile further, came to the beginning of the pillars in the Sea-cliff, 
as I believe, about five miles from the Causeway ; and the shore and cliffs being 
shaped mostly in little semicircular Bays, I had many very beautiful views of the 
upper and middle strata of Pillars : in one, particularly, they had much of the ap- 
pearance of ruined Portico&apos;s one over the other; and turning the little end of a Spy- 
glass, it appeared something like the ruins of Palmyra, as a View of them is repre- 
sented in a Copper-plate, published in the Philosophical Transactions. This won- 
derful work of nature is continued on in the cliffs for about a quarter of a mile 
beyond the Giant&apos;s Causeway. I saw it again in the road to Coleraine, five miles to 
the West of the Causeway, in a low hill a furlong to the South of the Road, and two 
miles to the South of the Sea. The Pillars here arc small ; and being about a mile 
and a half from Ballimagarry, where the Earl of Antrim has a ruined house, lately 
burnt down, it served, as I suppose, for a Quarry for building part of that bouse 
in which I saw a great number of the stones, and particularly one of nine sides. 
I saw others near two miles farther, to the South of the road in a low hill, within 
two miles of Coleraine ; so that the whole extends for about eleven Irish miles, 
or fourteen English. As I spent a week at the Causeway, and sent away by sea to 
Dublin as great a variety of the stones as C could conveniently get, particularly a 
large octagon, Avith the eight large stones round it ; a pair of less, with eight 
pair, that encompass it ; two small pentagon pillars, about fourteen inches over, 
one of them 3 feet 10J inches high, the other 5 feet 7 inches ; one hexagon pillar, 
about the same size, and 5 feet 5 inches high; all which I have placed in my 
garden ; so I have had an opportunity of considering it at leisure. It is a black 
stone, weighty and brittle : and I have been informed, that it was tried in a Glass- 
house, and that it melted with kelp, so as to make the black glass bottles : which 

2s 



G L A 

experiment, I have been told, was made by Mr. Dobbs of this kingdom, who is 
now in London. In relation to the joints in the pillars, this work of nature seems 
to be different from any thing yet known : and it must be very difficult to assign 
any satisfactory causes of it.&quot;

Glandelagh is valued in the King&apos;s Books at c :34..9..0 Irish Money. See,J}crha*- 
,nn, and Dublin. &quot; This was an ancient Episcopal See, and a well inhabited City, 
till about 1214, when the See was annexed to the Diocese of Dublin: And the 
City, memorable for its Religious edifices, not only suffered by decay, but insen- 
sibly became a receptacle for outlaws and robbers. The Archbishops of Dublin 
eould not obtain quiet possession till 1479, in which year, on the 30th of May, a 
surrender was made in the Cathedral of St. Patrick, Dublin, by Friar Dennis 
White, who had long usurped that See, in opposition to the Regal authority : 
From this Eera, Glandelagh has continued a desert : here the Mountains cast a melan- 
choly gloom on the inferior valley, contracting every prospect ; and so awful, so 
venerable is the scene, that, even to a momentary beholder, it appears as if formed 
for the study of the Eremetic life: Such was the situation chosen by St. Coemgene, 
or Keivin, who, descended from a Noble family, was born, A. D. 498 ; this Saint 
received the Sacrament of Baptism from the hands of St. Cronan, a priest, and at. 
the age of seven years he was placed under the care and tuition of Petrocus, a 
Briton, who had passed many years in this kingdom for the exercise of learning. 
Under this Reverend man St. Keivin continued till 510, when his parents, Coinlogh 
and Coemhella, sent him to the cell of Dogain, Lochan, and TEneas or Enna, 
three holy Anachorites, with whom he studied a considerable time, previous to 
his embracing the Monastic profession ; after which he took upon him the cowl 
and retired to these Wilds, where he wrote many learned works, particularly the 
life of St. Patrick, and where, he founded his Abbey, under the Invocation of St. 
Peter and St. Paul : Here he presided as Abbot and Bishop for a series of years, 
on the approach of death he received the sacrament from the hands of St. 
Mochuorog, and died on the 3d of June, A. D. 618, having nearly completed the 
uncommon and venerable age of one hundred and twenty years. His eminent 
virtues, his exemplary sanctity, and the miracles said to have been wrought by the 
Saint, drew multitudes from towns and cities, from ease and affluence, from the cares 
and avocations of civil life, and from the comforts and joys of society, to be spec- 
tators of his pious acts and sharers in his merits, and, with him, to encounter every 
severity of climate and condition: This influence extended even to Britain, and 
induced St. Mochuorog to convey himself hither, who fixed his Residence in a 
Cell on the East side of Glendalogh, where a city soon sprang up, and a seminary 
was founded, from whence \v ere sent forth many saints and exemplary men, whose 
sanctity and learning diffused around the Western world that universal light of 
letters and .religion, which, in the eaj-lier ages, shone so. resplendent throughout 



G L A 

this remote, and, at that time, tranquil Isle, and were almost exclusively confined 
to it. On the 3d of June, annually, numbers of every sex and age flock to the 
Seven Churches, and there celebrate the Festival of the esteemed and venerated 
t. Kervin. The ruins of this abbey (being the first which a traveller perceives) 
are situated in the bottom of the vale, and consist of two buildings parallel to 
each other (the larger one, on the South, being the church) ; on the East end of 
the abbey is an arch, of extremely curious workmanship ; the columns on the 
sides recede one behind another, and are very short, but do not diminish : the 
capitals are ornamented in a singular manner, most of them with human heads at 
the angles, and dragons or other fabulous animals at the sides ; the heads have 
much the appearance of those in Egyptian sculpture, with large ears, long eyes, 
and the tresses of the hair strait; the ring-stones of the arch are indented trian- 
gularly, in imitation of the Saxon architecture, and in some parts human heads 
and other ornaments are within the triangular mouldings. On the removal of 
some heaps of rubbish from under the ruins of this arch, a few stones beautifully 
carved were found, many of them belonging to the arches, and some to the archi- 
trave of the \vindow : the architrave is twelve inches broad, and a pannel is sunk, 
ornamented lozenge-wise, and an ovelo forms the lozenge, with a bead running 
on each side ; the centre of the lozenge is decorated on one side, in has relief, 
with a knot delicately carved; the other with a flower in the centre, and mould- 
ings corresponding to the shape of the lozenge. The half-lozenge, at the bottom 
of the pilaster, in one is filled with a bas relief of a human head, with a bird on 
each side pecking at the eye, and the other by a dragon, twisting its head round 
and the tail turned up between its legs into the mouth. Here is another stone, 
apparently the capital of a column ; two sides of it are visible, both are ornamented 
with a patera, but each side in a different manner; one consists of a flower of 
sixteen large leaves and fifteen smaller ones, relieved the eighth of an inch, and 
the other of six leaves branching from the centre, with another leaf extending 
between their points. In describing the other ruins of this desolated city (which 
appears to have been built in an elegant style of Grecian architecture), we in some 
measure outstep the bounds originally prescribed, in which Monastic dwellings 
were alone included; but their contiguity to the abbey, which we have just now 
quitted, induces us to proceed to the next erection, called THE CHURCH OF THE 
TRINITY ; It stands on a rising ground, North of the Abbey ; and, as the inhabit- 
ants say, was dedicated to the Holy Trinity ; in the front of this church is a cir- 
cular building upon a square base, which evidently was intended for a belfry, a 
sufficient space being left for the rope to come down. Hence let us come to THE 
SEVEN CHuaciiEs, for which Glandelagh has been for many centuries remarkable, 
and for which it will be celebrated, even when the vestiges now remaining are 
no more. The entrance to the area, on which these churches stand, is on the 
North-east side, through the ruins of a gateway, sixteen feet six inches in length, 



G L A 

by sixteen feet in width; the arches, which are still entire, are nine feet seven 
inches wide and ten feet high, and the ring-stones, of mountain granite, are the 
full depth of the wall ; the outside arch is composed of twenty four stones, and 
the inside one of twenty seven, which are two feet six inches in depth. THE 
CATHEDRAL CHURCH ranks as the first, and owes its origin to St. Keivin, by 
whom it was dedicated to the Patron Saints of the Abbey. It measures forty 
eight feet in length and thirty in width ; on the South side were three small 
windows, and at the East end was an arch seventeen feet six inches wide, behind 
which was another building thirty seven feet six inches in length, by twenty 
three feet in width, with a beautiful window at the East end, on the North are 
two small ones, and erne on the South, with a door three feet eight inches wide, 
communicating to a small building of sixteen feet by ten, the door of the church 
is seven feet four inches high, three feet six inches wide at top, and three feet ten 
at bottom : the jambs are composed of four courses and a lintel at top, over which is a 
discharging arch ; the stones are the entire depth of the walls, with a reveal cut 
at the inside for the door, which appears to have turned on pivots ; holes are cut 
for bars across, and iron cramps and bolts appear in some places;, several courses- 
of this building are of hewn stone, as well as a kind of pilasters, which project 
from the ends of the wall to the front ami rear, and measure two feet six inches 
in width ; the wall of the building to the East, within these, is detached, and has 
the appearance of a more modern style. Under a small window, at the South side 
of the choir, is a tomb of freestone, ornamented, and in. the cemetery stands a 
Round tower, one hundred and ten feet high r uncommonly well built, and in fine&apos; 
preservation^ the roof alone having suffered by time ; at the bottom it measure* 
fifty two feet in girth, and the walls are four feet thick. The remains- of several 
crosses may still be seen amongst these ruins, and that situated in the cemetery of 
this chinch, particularly merits notice, being one entire stone,, eleven feet in 
height. ST. KEIVIN&apos;S KITCHEN (its vulgar appellation), was undoubtedly one of 
the Seven Churches, and is now almost entire, having suffered alone in the ruin/ 
of a window, the only one in the church, this was placed about eight feet from, 
the South-east angle, and was ornamented with aa architrave elegantly wrought, 
but being of free-stone, it was conveyed away by the neighbouring inhab- 
itants, and brayed to powder for domestic use. The area of this church mea- 
sures twenty two feet nine inches by fifteen, in height it is twenty feet, and the 
walls are three feet six in thickness ; at the East end is an arch five feet three 
inches in width, which communicates to another building ten feet six in length r 
by nine feet three in width; on the North side of which is a door two feet two 1 
inches wide, which communicates with another chapel of tire same length, and; 
seven feet nine inches in width; each of these buildings has a small window in 
the centre to the East, the walls are three feet thick, and both measure twelve 
feet in height. The foundation, with two or three courses of the building, is laid: 



G L A 

of cut inountain grit ; the door is six feet eight inches high, two feet four inches 
wide at top, and two feet eight inches at bottom, most of the stones run through 
the entire thickness of the wall ; the lintel is five feet eight inches in length, hy 
eleven inches and an half in depth, and a rude corriice, projecting about five 
inches, and measuring four feet ten inches long, by six inches in depth, is worked 
out of the same stone. A round Belfry rises from the West end of the church, the 
entrance to it is through a square hole in the cove of the church, over which, 
between the cove and the roof, is a large space, open to the belfry, that received 
its light from a small window. The height of (his tower is about forty five 
feet; the roof, both of the church and tower, is composed of thin stones, very 
neatly laid, and with a very high pitch ; the ridge of the roof is about thirty feet 
above the ground, and the double building at the rear, is only twenty feet; hav- 
ing ascended the roof of this building, we discover a groove cut in the East end 
of the larger building, which shews that this was not the original tower, but 
much higher and narrower than the former; indeed the walls of the double 
building are separated from those of the larger, and, though undoubtedly very an- 
cient, yet the inferiority of the materials and workmanship, evidently show that 
this work was posterior to the former, and erected by much less skilful builders. 
Oun LADY&apos;S CHURCH, the most Westward of the seven, and nearly opposite to- 
the Cathedral, is now almost in ruins; but from the doorway, and the few remains 
of walls, it appears to have been built with more knowledge of the art than the 
other buildings. The door consists of only three courses ; the lintel is five feet 
six inches in length, and fourteen inches and an half in depth ; the door is six 
feet four in height, two feet six in width at top, and two feet ten at bottom; a 
kind of architrave is worked round the door six inches broad, and in the bottom 
of the lintel an ornament is wrought in a cross resembling the flyer of a stamping- 
press. The walls are carried up with hewn stone, in general of a large size, to 
about the height of the door, and the remainder are of the rude mountain rag-stone, 
but laid incomparably well. At the East end was an arch of hewn stone exactly 
similar to that of the Cathedral. THE RHEFEART, literally the Sepulchre of Kings, 
is famous for having seven princes interred within its limits ; in this church is 
the tomb of Mac Mthuil, or O&apos;Toole, the ancient Chieftain of the country, with 
the following inscription, in the Irish character : 

JESUS CHRIST 

Mile Deach Feuch Corp Re Mac Mthuil. 
Sec here the Resting-place of the body of King Mac Thuill, who died in Christ 1010. 

Many others of this family are said to have been interred here, where a stone 
cross, elegantly carved, is still preserved. PHIOHY OF ST. SAVIOUR, commonly 
called the Eastern Church. Of this building, little can be said, the foundation 
only remaining; but about five years since, a quantity of stone, remarkably well 



G L A 

wrought, was discovered here, and on removing an heap of rubbish, the collection 
of many centuries, two clusters of columns weie found, with curious emblematic 
decorations, which had supported a great fretted arch, composed of the before- 
mentioned stones, which led to the discovery. THE Ivy CHURCH, is situated 
somewhat to the Westward, and has large breaches in its walls long since over- 
grown with ivy; nothing&apos; worthy of remark can be found in this building, which 
is entirely unroofed. TEAMPULLNA SKELLIG. Situated in the recess of the 
South mountain, was the ancient Priory of the Rock, and was also called, The 
Temple of the Desert, both expressive of the Irish appellation.; The celebrated 
BED OF ST. KEIVIN, on the South side of the Lough, is a cave, hewn in the solid 
roCk, ou the side of the mountain, exceeding difficult in ascent and terrible in 
prospect, for it hangs perpendicular over the lake, at an alarming height above, 
the surface of the water ; at a small distance from this bed, on the same side 
of the mountain, are to be seen, the ruins of a small stone building, called 
ST. KEIVIN&apos;S CELL. We shall now bid adieu to this illustrious Seminary, which 
(in the language of a late eminent writer) &apos; was once the Luminary of the W F.STERN 
WORLD, whence savage Septs and roving barbarians derived the benefits of 
knowledge and the blessings of religion&apos;. The romantic shape of the surrounding 
Mountains, many of which are covered with a fresh spring of wood, and others, 
though of a surprising height, retaining the liveliest verdure almost throughout 
the year; these, added to the winding form of a very fertile valley, which termi- 
nates in a Lake of considerable extent, increase our veneration ; in a word, on a re- 
view of such a scene, &apos; to abstract the mind from all local emotion would be im*- 
possible, if it were endeavoured, and would be foolish, if it were possible. What- 
ever withdraws us from the power of our senses; whatever makes the past, the 
distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of 
thinking beings. Far from us and from our friends be such frigid philosophy as 
may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dig- 
nified by wisdom or by virtue. That man is little to be envied, whose piety will 
not grow warmer as he treads the ruins of Glandelogh&apos; \&quot;Archdall&apos;s Monast,

HOLM-PATRICK, in the Barony of Balruddery, Co. of DUBLIN, and Province 
of Leinster : an Impropriate Cure : a Church, in good order : no Glebe House, 
or Glebe : The Rev. William Henry Johnson, A. B., the Incumbent (in 1806), 
who has cure of souls, is resident, and discharges the duties in person. Halm- 
Patrick is in the Dioceses of Dublin and Glandelagh, and Province of Dublin. It 
is 3ij m. S. E. from Balbriggen. It is situate upon the Irish Sea. &quot; Sitric, the 
Son of Murchard, founded a Priory for Regular Canons on Inis Patrick, an island 
about a mile South East of Holm-Patrick. The situation of this priory (the ruins 
of which are still visible), being very inconvenient, it was, between the years 
1213, and 1228, removed by Henry, Archbishop of Dublin, to Holm- Patrick, on 
the Sea-side, 14 miles North by East from Dublin.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern.

HOLY CROSS, in the Barony of Eliogurty, Co. of TIPPERARY, aiAl Province 
of Minister : a Perpetual Curacy, inserted in the same Licence with Rathkennan, 
when a Curate is appointed : a Church, in indifferent repair, at Holy Cross : no 
Glebe House, but 20 acres of Glebe Land have lately been purchased by the 
Board of First Fruits, and granted to Holy Cross, on which a Glebe House will 
shortly be built : The Rev. Thomas B. Dunlevie, the Incumbent (in 1806), who 
has cure of souls, is resident, and performs the duties in person. The whole Tythes 
of these two parishes, except ,12. per annum, are received by Lay Impropriators. 
The Income has been made up to the sum of&lt;60. per annum to the Curate, by the 
Trustees of Primate Boulter&apos;s bequest. Holy Cross is in the Diocese of Cashel, and 
Province of Cashel. It is 3j m. ,S. W. from Thurles. It is situate upon the River 
Suir. The Fairs are holden on the 1 1th of May, 24th of September, and 18th of 
October. &quot; Donogh Carbragh O&apos;Brien, King of Limerick, founded a celebrated 
Abbey here, in honour of the Holy Cross, St. Mary and St. Benedict, for Monks 
of the Cistertian Order. This abbey was a daughter of the Abbey of Nenay, or 
Maig, in the County of Limerick, and the Abbot was stilcd Earl of Holy Cross, 
the lands belonging to the abbey being an Earldom ; he was also a Baron of 
Parliament, and was usually Vicar General of the Cistertian Order in Ireland. 
The architecture of this erection was uncommonly fine, the building consists of an 
high steeple nearly square, supported on each side by a beautiful Gothic arch, and 
in the centre by a great variety of ogives passing diagonally from each angle,&amp;c. : 
on the East side thereof is a small Chapel, 21 feet in breadth and 24 in length; 
the roof is arched, and beautifully supported by a number of ogives from the sides 
and angles ; on the South side is a Gothic tomb, which, according to O&apos;Hallaran, is 
that of the founder, with a cross thereon but no inscription ; the tradition of the 



H O R 

place, however, informs us, that this tomb was erected for the Good Woman, 
who brought the Holy relique hither : between the nave and steeple is a space 
of 21 f. 6 in. in breadth, and 30 in length, detached from the nave by an arch, 
which, we suppose, made a part of the choir : the nave is 49 feet broad, and 58 lon-; 
on eacli side is an arcade of four arches, with lateral aisles which pass on either side 
of that part we conclude to have been the choir : the entrance is by a door at the 
West end, under a large window. On the South side of the choir are two Chapels 
each about 10 feet square, and both of them arched and supported as the other 
parts of the building ; between these are a double row of Gothic arches, sup- 
ported by twisted pillars, each distant about two feet four inches from the other ; 
here the ceremony of waking the Monks was performed, and not where the holy 
relique was kept, as remarked by a respectable writer, in a plate which by mistake 
is reversed : on the North side of the choir are two other Chapels, each of them 
seven feet long, and eleven feet broad, with roofs supported in like manner as the 
others ; and between these and the opposite lateral aisle the whole is arched ; 
but opposite the South chapel there is an open space, with a large flight of stairs 
leading to the steeple,&amp;c. ; in the north angle of which are stairs which ascend 
to the top. The difference in the wdrk of this monastery is very extraordinary; 
nothing could have been more highly finished than the steeple and chapels, which 
are built of marble and limestone, yet the nave, the aisles, and adjoining ruins, 
are miserably mean. On the South side the ruins cover a considerable space. 
The River Suire, which before it reaches the sea is so amazingly extensive, flows 
near the ruins of this monastery in a small stream. A parish church, with a few 
wretched Cabbins, are the only remains of a once celebrated town.&quot; Archdall&apos;s

HOOKE, in the Barony of Shelburne, Co. of WEXFORD, and Province of Lein-

MORE ABBEY, in the Barony of Middle Third, Co. of TIPPERARY, and Province 
of Munster : a Rectory entire, Episcopally united, in 1789, to the R. andV. of Brick- 
endown ; no Church: no Glebe House, or Glebe: The Rev. R.Alexander, the Incum 
bent (in 1 806), who has cure of souls, and is resident at NewRoss, from whence he 
performs the duties of a parish, in the Diocese of Ossory : the.duties are performed 
by The Rev. Frederick Neligan, the Curate of the adjoining parish of St. John&apos;s, 
in 1806. Hore Abbey is in the Diocese of Cashel, and Province of Cashel. It 
is | m. S. W. from Cashel. The parishes in the Union of Hore Abbey are nearly 
contiguous : that of Hore Abbey containing 777 acres. According to the Eccle- 
siastical Report, each of these parishes, separately, is too small to afford comfort 



H O R 

to a Resident Incumbent. &quot;Hore Abbey, called also St. Mary&apos;s Abbey of the 
Rock of Cashel, was situated near the Cathedral Church, and originally founded 
for Benedictines : But the Archbishop, David Mac Carvill, having dreamed, in the 
year 1269, or 1272, that these Monks had made an attempt to cut off his head, he 
violently dispossessed the unfortunate men, of their house, lands,&amp;c., and gave 
the whole of their possessions to a body of &apos;Cistertian Monks, whom he brought 
from the Abbey of Mellifont, in the county of Louth, and at the same time took 
on himself the habit of that order. The noble ruins of this erection still remain, 
and are for the most part entire. The steeple is large, and about 20 feet square 
on the inside, which is supported by a variety of ogives from each angle, some 
meeting in an octagon in the center, and others at the key stones of the vault, 
and the structure is supported by two fine arches about thirty feet high. The choir 
or chapel, which adjoins the East side of the steeple, is about 29 feet in length and 
24 in breadth on the inside : The East window is small and plain ; and in the side 
walls are some remains of stalls,&amp;c. The nave is 60 feet in length, 23 in breadth, 
and on each side was an arcade of three Gothic arches, the North side whereof is 
levelled, with lateral aisles, which were about 13 feet broad ; between this and the 
steeple is apart, but we are equally ignorant as to its name and the use it was ap- 
plied to, it is 31 feet in length, of the same breadth with the nave, and divided 
from the steeple by a plain wall ; on each side are similar arcades of two 
arches only, and this opens with the West arch of the steeple. On the south side 
of the steeple is a small door leading into an open part, about 30 feet long and 4 
broad: the side walls are much broken, and in the gable end is a long window ; 
there is a similar division on the North side of the steeple. Here is a small, low, 
arched apartment, which seems to have been a Confessionary, as there are niches 
in the wall, with holes, kc.&quot;Archdairs Monast. Hibern. p. 648.

founded here, under the Invocation of St. John the Baptist, in the reign of King- 
John, by Geoffrey de Mafiscis; who was chief Governor of Ireland in the year 
1215. Queen Elizabeth granted this hospital and its possessions to Sir Valentine 
Browne, who erected a magnificent Castle on the site of the same, which castle 
is now in ruins. The walls of the ancient church yet remain : and in a nich on 
the North side of the high altar is the tomb of a Knight, in alto relievo, which is

INISMURRAY, ISLAND, off the Barony of Carbury, Co. of SLIGO, and Prov- 
ince of Connaught. &quot; In the early ages, there was an Abbey here, dedicated to 
the Virgin Mary, and governed by St. Dicholla, the son of Meinida, who died 
A. D. 747. This Island is a Rock rising from the Sea, with horrid precipices 
towards the Ocean, but shelving gently, like steps, on the side opposite the land. 
It contains about 130 acres of a shallow soil, from four to five inches in depth, 
which serves to feed some sheep, a few cows, and five or six horses, the remainder 
of the island is a mere rock. The habitable part contains about 40 or 50 people, 
children included, who lire in five houses, with as many barns adjoining them. They 
intermarry amongst each other, and when the laud is overstocked with inhabitants, 
they seek their fortunes on the great Island of Ireland. They are one community, 
and live by fishing and selling their fish on the Main. They speak Irish only, 
one man bowed beneath the weight of years excepted (in 1779): and boast their 
having had this island in possession upwards of seven hundred years. \\ hat is 
called the Abbey, is an inclosute of dry stones, from five to seven and eight feet 
thick. It is impossible to determine whether it is round or oval; more rude, 
inelegant workmanship was never seen. There are a few cells under ground, 



I N I 

which receive their light, some through a hole at the top, others through a loop- 
hole in the side; they are dark, and horrible dungeons. There are also two 
Chapels huilt with mortar, and quite in a gross state, as is St. Molasse&apos;s Cell, 
which has a stone roof, and where the statue of the Saint is preserved. One of 
the chapels, standing hy itself has an extraordinary window, the arch of which is 
one rough crooked stone, just in its original shape. Here is an altar, called the 
cursing altar, which is covered with round stones, and North-West of this, stands 
the altar of the Trinity. The neighbouring inhabitants say, that if a man, who is 
really wronged, turns one of these stones, and, at the same time, curses his 
adversary, the wish, whatsoever it is, will fall upon him if guilty, but if otherwise, 
the curse recoils upon the person who denounces it ; this keeps them in such awe, 
as to prevent rash imprecations. There are several small inclosures with a stone 
in the centre, and some springs, each of them consecrated to a particular saint. 
A statue of their Patron, Saint Molasse, very rudely carved in wood, and painted 
of aredish colour, is still preserved here. The Abbey was erected conjointly by 
this Saint and St. Columb, but the latter being of an impetuous and fiery disposi- 
tion could not accord with the mildness of Molasse, and betook himself to the 
Main-land, leaving the other in peaceable possession.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern.

lounagh are not contiguous ; and are at least twenty-three miles separate. Ac- 
cording to the Ecclesiastical Report, the entire Rectory of Innislounagh might 
very well stand alone ; and Glebe land ought (if possible), to be purchased near 
the church, and a Glebe House built thereon. &quot; St. Mochoemoc, or The Beauti- 
ful, founded an Abbey at Inisleamhnacta, which he dedicated to the Virgin Mary, 
and died on the 13th of March 655 ; This was a singularly beautiful building, in 
which was a Chapel, said to have been consecrated by St. Patrick. There is also 
a celebrated well here, which, as we are told, wrought many miracles, particularly 
in removing distempers. The learned Nicholas Fagan, Abbot of Inislaughnaght, 
provided by the Pope to the See of Waterford, was interred here in 1617.&quot; Arch-

who was educated under St. Fiech at Sletty, and afterwards under St. Finian at 
Clonard, founded this famous Abbey (on an Island, in Lough Erne, about half a 
mile from the shore), and died in the year 523 or 530. His Festival is commem- 
orated here on the 18th of January. The Saint&apos;s Bell, ornamented with gold and 
silver, is yet preserved here as a precious relique, and is holden in so great venera- 
tion amongst the lower class of people, that it is often judicially tendered them to 
ssvear on. This ancient abbey, in process of time, was converted into a parish 
church, with a very large district, being a Rectory and Vicarage, in the Diocese 
of Clogher; but the situation being at length found to be highly inconvenient, it 
was in the reign of Queen Anne removed to Drumenagh, in the same parish, on

and in former ages it was the Burial-place of the parish of Calry. In a rock, near 
the door of the church, is a cavity, called Our Lady&apos;s Bed, which is said to be 
favourable to women in pregnancy, who fondly imagine, that, by going into it and 
turning thrice round, at the same time saying certain prayers, they shall not die 
in labour. This rock, and the remains of the church, are now entirely covered 
with ivy.&quot; Archdalts Monast. Hibern. p. 633.

IRELAND&apos;S EYE, off the Barony of Coolock, Co. of DUBLIN, and Province

Archbishop Allen, in the Liber Niger, says, &apos; That book is holden in so much 
esteem and veneration, that good men scarcely dare take an oath on it, for fear 
of the judgments of God being immediately shewn on those who should forswear

the cemetery of the Mac Carthy family. And Donald, Earl of Clancare, was 
interred here; as was Patrick, Lord Kerry, the EaiTs nephew, who died on the 12th 
of August 1600. This Abbey&quot; was re-edified by the Roman Catholicks in the year 
1602, but was soon after permitted to go to ruin. It is surrounded by a venerable 
grove of very tall ash-trees, which in some places grow spontaneously from the 
ruins. The choir, nave, and steeple, are yet entire, as are the cloisters, which 
consist of several Gothic arches all of solid marble, inclosing a small square, in 
the centre of which stands a very tall yew-tree, whose spreading branches, over- 
shadowing and throwing a browu shade over the niches of the whole cloister, form 



I S. L 

a much more solemn and awful kind of covering than the original one. The 
steeple of this extensive building is supported by a Gothic arch, which, from its

site the Cardinal points. The celebrated Monastery of Regular Canons, founded in 
this town, about the year 550, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, owes its origin

the son of Kervaill, King of Ireland. A Priory or Hospital, under the Invoca- 
tion of St. John the Baptist, was founded in this town, by Walter de Lacie, Lord

church, for the occupation of the Dean and Chapter, who are poorly endowed.

account of his great age and infirmities. The other Members of the Cathedral are

to the Bishoprick, in which seven fields (viz, No. 1, 2, 5, 6&apos;, 7,), are marked Mensal 
Lands, and contain 67 acres and 1 rood ; but, by a modern admeasurement, the 
same fields have been found to contain, of Plantation measure, 72 acres and 3 
roods. In the above-mentioned old map, a field, adjoining the Cathedral precincts, 
or church-yard, is distinguished by being intituled, The Palace, and it is there 
stated to contain 3 acres and 2 roods; but, by the modern admeasurement, it is 
no more than 3 acres. These lands were formerly, and still are intersected by 
roads, and there have been no traces known of The Palace in the memory of the 
oldest inhabitant of the town, in 1806. The Bishop of the Diocese has not the 
power, by virtue of any existing law, to charge upon his successors any sum 
adequate to the building of a palace, by reason of the Tenuity of the Bishoprick.

Duke of Leinster. Of the original church, and city, of Kildare, there are at 
present no remains; both the church, and other buildings, having been frequently 
plundered, and destroyed by the Danes. The present town, which seems to be 
situate Eastward of the ancient one, stands boldly on a rising ground, and con- 
sists of the Cathedral, part of the Castle which is inhabited, the County Infirmary, 
the Parish School adjoining the church, a Roman Catholic Chapel, a Market 
House, and about 180 houses, most of which, however, are but indifferent. The 
Curragh of Kildare contains near 5000 English acres, and is under the superin- 
tendency of a Ranger. It is the Newmarket of Ireland, and generally allowed 
to exceed the English race-ground in elasticity of turf, and in characteristic 
beauty; the Meetings are holden on the last week in April, the second Monday 
in June, and the second Monday in September, when King&apos;s Plates are run for by 
Irish bred horses. The Bishoprick of Kildare, which is valued in the King&apos;s Books 
at&lt;69.. 1 1..4 Irish Money, was founded, according to Dr. Beaufort, about the end 
of the Fifth century. Its greatest length, from East to West, does not exceed 36 
miles, nor its greatest breadth 23 miles. This See comprehends part of the Counties 
of Kildare, the King&apos;s County, and the Queen&apos;s County. &quot;St. Brigid, the illegit- 
imate daughter of an Irish chieftain, was born in the year 453, and in the 1.4th year 
of her age she received the veil from the hands of St. Patrick himself, or from one 
of his immediate disciples ; it is said she made a pilgrimage to the Abbey of Glas- 
tonbury, in Somersetshire. She founded a Nunnery here, before the year 484 ; and 
about the same time an Abbey was also founded under the same roof for monks, 
but separated by walls from the nunnery ; it afterwards came into possession of 
the Regular Canons of St. Augustine. The Nuns and Monks had but one church, 



K I L 

in common, which they entered at different doors. St Brigid presided as well over 
the Monks, as Nuns, and, strange to tell ! the Abbot of this House was subject 
to the Abbess for several years after the death of the celebrated founder, which 
happened in the year 523, on the first of February, when her Feast is celebrated. 
She was interred here, but her remains were afterwards removed to the Cathedral 
Church of Down. Gray Abbey is situated on the South side of the town ; this 
monastery was erected for Friars of the Franciscan Order, or, as they were more 
generally called, Gray Friars, in the year 1260, by the Lord William de Vescy ; 
but the building was completed by Gerald Fitz-Maurice, Lord Offaley. A consid- 
erable part of this abbey still remains ; which, from the appearance of the 
ruins, was of very small extent. An House for Carmelites, or White Friars, was 
founded in this town in the year 1290, by William de Vescy. Several Chapters 
of this Order were holden in Atherdee and in Dublin by David O&apos;Buge, who 
was born in this town, and was a man of sound erudition, as such, he was in 
the highest estimation at Oxford and at Treves in Germany, and wrote several 
learned works. He was well versed in Divinity, Philosophy, Rhetorick, and 
the Canon and Civil law, and was generally called the burning Light, the Mirror, 
and the Ornament of his country. O&apos;Buge flourished about the year 1320, when he 
was Provincial of the Carmelite Order, and died full of years, and full of honour 
in this friary, where he was interred.&quot; ArchdalVs Monast. Hibern. pp. 323. et seq.

October, and gth of November. This city sends one Member to Parliament. It 
is governed by a Mayor, Deputy, two Sheriffs, a Recorder, and Town Clerk. 
Here is a Charter School, which was opened in the year 1745, for 70 Boys. This 
City came by marriage into the ancient family of Le Despencer. It was incorporated 
by Charter, from King James the First, in 1609. It surrendered to Oliver Cromwell, 
in 1 650. It gives title of Earl to the family of Butler. The City of Kilkenny, and 
the Borough of St. Canice, or Irish-Town, according to Dr. Beaufort, form but 
one large town, which stands in the midst of The County of the City of Kilkenny. 
It is delightfully situate on the River Nore, over which are two handsome bridges. 
Of the many large and good buildings that adorn this city, I shall only mention 
the Bishop&apos;s Palace, the magnificent Castle of the Earl of Ormond, and the cele- 
brated Free School or College, founded by the Butler family, and lately re-built 
on a large scale. The houses are decorated with a very beautiful black and white 
marble, from the large Quarries in the neighbourhood of this city, which supply* 
various parts of Ireland, and even London, with this commodity. Kilkenny con- 
tains about 16,00 souls ; and has been long noted for the politeness of its inhabit- 
ants. In this city, and its environs, abundance of blankets and much coarse 
woollen cloth are manufactured. See, St. Canice.&quot; No Religious House appears 
to have been in this city, till after the year 1211, when William Mareschal the 
elder, Earl of Pembroke, founded, on the East side of the town, and near the 
head of the small bridge, the Priory of St. John the Evangelist, for the relief of 
indigent poor. This monastery (with various possessions) was granted to the 
Mayor and Citizens of Kilkenny. The ruins of this building still remain in St. 



K I L 

John Street. The Franciscan Friary was founded (on the banks of the JVbre) for 
Conventual Franciscans: And Richard Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, is by some 
writers made the Founder. Near the Infirmary of the monastery is a well, Avhich 
was dedicated to St. Francis : it was formerly celebrated for many miracles said 
to have been wrought there, and still retains some degree of credit amongst the 
superstitious. This building, with its offices, was of great extent, reaching from 
the street and city walls to the river; and the ruins, which still remain, sufficiently 
evince its former elegance and grandeur.&quot; ArchdalCs Monast. Hibern. pp. 368.

Abbot St. Scannail died A. D. 773. A Priory or Hospital was afterwards erected 
in this town for Cross-bearers, or Crouched Friars, under the Invocation of St. 
John the Baptist. Some writers erroneously give the foundation to the family of 
Tyrrell ; but, from the best authority, we say, that Friar Thomas, a Priest, and 
grandson of Sir Thomas Dillon, who came into Ireland, A. D. 1185, was the 
founder of this house, and lies interred here. There was an Holy Well here, dedi- 
cated to the Virgin Mary.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibarii. p. 70.

are of a great length, and strong in proportion ; these, and a noble Gothic East 
Avindosv, are yet entire. The architecture, which is of a dark marble, bespeaks 
the structure to be much more modern than the time before mentioned. Large

antiquity : it is the only church in the parish, though a Round tower at the

fortable residence. It is not 30 miles distant from the most remote part of either

is a considerable Salmon and Eel Fishery. It is a place of great Antiquity. The 
Diocese of Killaloe (valued in the King&apos;s Books at&lt;20..0..0 sterling) was founded, 
according to Dr. Beaufort, early in the Fifth century : in the Twelfth, it was incor- 
porated with the ancient Bishoprick of lloscrea, which was founded in 620. And in 
the year 1752, the See of Kilfenora, which had been established about the Twelfth 
century, was united to it ; and though very small in extent and value, had con- 
tinued separate till after the Restoration, when it was first annexed to the Arch- 
bishopiiciv of Tuain : That Union continued 81 years, till 1741, when Ardagh 
being annexed to Tuam, this Bishoprick was given in. Commendam to the Bishop 
of Clonfert. The Diocese of Killaloe stretches 80 miles in length, through the 
Counties of Clare and Tipperary, into the King&apos;s County, and includes also a small 
part of the Queen&apos;s County, Galway, and Limerick. It varies in breadth from 
seven to twenty five miles. Kilfenora is confined to the Baronies of Burrin, and 
Corcomroe, and extends only 18 miles by nine. The Chapter consists of a Dean 
(see, Kilkeary), Precentor (see Lateragh), Chancellor (see, Toomtvard), Trea- 
surer (see, Dromime), and Archdeacon (see, Aghlishcloghane), and five Prebend- 
aries. The Church of Killaloe is not large for a Cathedral, but venerable for its 
antiquity, and in good preservation, though built above 660 years. It serves like 
many others for the parish church. Very near the little town of Killaloe, in the 
midst, of a fine Demesne, beautifully situate on the Western Bank of the Shannon, 
stands the Episcopal Residence, a handsome new House, erected by the late Arch- 
bishop of Dublin, when Bishop of Killaloe. This See is 50 miles from the South 
West extremity of the Diocese. &quot; St. Molualobhair, the grandson of Eocha 
Bailldearg, King of North Munster, founded an Abbey here, about the beginning 
of the Sixth century. He was succeeded by his Disciple St. Flannan, who, 
about the. year 639, was consecrated Bishop of the place ; from this time we hear 
no more of it as an abbey. Killaloe was anciently the Resort of many pilgrims.&quot;

according to Dr. Beaufort, in the beginning of the 7th century. It was united 



K I L 

to the See of Clonfert in 1602. The Members of the Chapter are a Dean, a 
Provost, a Chancellor, an Archdeacon, and two Prebendaries. See, Clonfert. 
&quot;St. Colman, the son of Duach, founded an Abbey here about the year 620, 
and Maurice, Bishop of this See, who died in 1283, erected on the ancient site, a 
Monastery for regular Canons of the Order of St. Augustine. This abbey is 
situated to the North West of the Cathedral (which is now in ruins), on a neck of 
land between two Loughs, which, according to some authors, evacuate themselves 
in summer into whirlpools ; however, this rarely happens, as the water never goes 
off but in a very dry season. The church, though small, is a very neat building, 
the pillars and arches, from the entrance to the altar part, and those of the East 
window, are finished in an elegant style, and the angles at the East end are worked 
in pillars. To the South of the church is a Sacristy, and adjoining to that a room, 
where was probably deposited the valuable effects belonging to the church, and 
which being arched, they call the Jail ; on the South of these, is a Chapel and the 
Refectory ; from the whole of this we may infer, that the Canons of the Monast- 
ery dwelt in separate houses. To the North, about two feet from the church, 
is an old wall ; an ancient tradition still exists at Kilmacduagh, of its being once a 
place of penance. There is also an Hoi}&apos; Well here, with a circular inclosure. Here 
is an ancient Round tower, which leans 17^ feet from its perpendicular. It may 
not be improper to remark, that the Tower at-Pisa, so universally celebrated, leans 
but 13 feet. At the general suppression, this monastery was granted to Richard 
Earl of Clanricarde.&quot; ArchdalVs Monast. Hibern. p. 291.

ries ago, one of the best built inland towns in the kingdom. The walls of many 
large houses evidently of a date, of excellent workmanship, and all of cut stone, 
remain at this day; and the ruins of Churches and Monasteries, the Walls and Gates 
of the town, with the extensive district contained In the Liberty of Kilmallock, 
prove the former splendour of a town, which is now no more than a miserable 
village. It makes a conspicuous figure in the Military History of Ireland. The 
parishes in the Union of Kilmallock are contiguous, and contain 8000 acres of 
land. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, each of these parishes, separately, 
is too small to afford the means of comfort to a Resident Incumbent. &quot; An 
Abbey was founded hereby St. Mocheallog, who died between the years 639 and 
656. This is now the parish church. The Friars of the Order of St. Dominick 
seated themselves here, A. D. 1291: and the tradition of the place informs us, 
that the founder of this Friary was Gilbert, the second son of John of Callen, 
Lord Oftaley. The ruins of this monastery, which was situated within the town, 
may still be seen, and are sufficient to convince every observer, that this was. 
once an elegant erection.&quot; Archdalfs Monast. Hibern. p. 424.

Limerick is in the Diocese of Limerick, and Province of Cashel. &apos; The Right 
.Rev. Charles Warburton, D. D., Lord Bishop, in 1810. It is 9-t in. S. W. from 
Dublin. It has six Post-days in the week. The Markets are on Wednesday, and 
Saturday. The Fairs are holden on Easter Tuesday, 4th of July, 4th of August, 
and 12th of December. There is a Privilege annexed to the Fair, which is holden 
on the 4th of August, that, during fifteen days, no person can be arrested in the 
City or Liberties, on any Process issuing out of the Tkolsel Court of Limerick. 
This City sends one Member to Parliament, The Magistrates are a Mayor, two 
Sheriffs, a Recorder, Town Clerk, Aldermen, and Burgesses; it hath also u Mil- 
itary Governor, Constable, and Town Major. It is composed of the Irish and 
English town ; the latter standing on the King&apos;s Island, which is formed by the 
River Shannon, and which admits Ships of 500 tons burden* to its Quays. It is the 
Chief town in the county; and gives title of Viscount to the family of Hamilton. 
The population is estimated at upwards of Forty thousand. The Bishoprick of 
Limerick (valued in the King&apos;s Books at ,40. sterling) was united, according to 
Dr. Beaufort, in 1663, to those of Ardfert and Aghadoe, which had long been so in- 
corporated, as to form but one Diocese. Ardfert, or, Ardart, was established in 
the Fifth century, and Limerick before the Thirteenth. The latter extends in 
length, from East to West, 27 miles in the County of Limerick, and 17 miles in 
breadth; taking in a small part of Clare. The Bishoprick of Ardfert, which in- 
cludes the whole county of Kerry, and a portion of Cork, is 52 miles long from 
North to South, and 48 miles broad. There are 71 miles from one extremity of 
the Union to the other. The Chapter of Limerick consists of a Dean, Precentor 
(see, Nantinan), Chancellor (see, Ruthkeale), Treasurer (see, St. Patrick&apos;s), and 
Archdeacon, and 11 Prebendaries. The Cathedral of Limenck is an ancient and 
venerable pile. The Bishop&apos;s Palace is a comfortable modern house, pleasantly 
situate on the Shannon, at the West end of the City; about 30 miles from the 
bounds of the Diocese of Limerick, and 80 miles from some parts of Ardfert. 
&quot; About the time of the arrival of the English (in 1174), an House was founded 
here for Black Nuns of the Order of St. Augustin, by Donald O&apos;Brien, King of 
Limerick, who dedicated it to St. Peter. In the reign of King John, a Friary was 
founded under the Invocation of St. Mary and St. Edward the King, by Simon 
Minor, a citizen of Limerick, for Regular Canons of the Order of St. Augustin. 



L I S 

This Priory, situated near BallVBridge, was granted at the Suppression to Edmund 
Sexton. A Dominican Friary was founded here under the Invocation of St. 
Saviour, by Donogh Carbrcach O&apos;Brien, king of Thomond. He was interred here 
in the year 1241, in a tomb with his statue placed over it. We are. told by another 
writer, that he was interred at Killaloe. Part of the Friary is now converted into 
a tan-yard, and a large barrack has been erected on the other part : some small 
remains of the church, walls,&amp;c., may yet be seen A Gray Friary was founded 
in the reign of King Henry III, by O&apos;Brien, a lineal descendant of the kings of 
Limerick and Thomond. This Friary stood without the town wall, and where the 
County court-house is now erected. The oltl church has been since converted into 
the County hospital. Wadding says, that another Franciscan Monastery was 
founded here in the year 1293, in the King&apos;s Island near Limerick. The August-, 
inian Friary, generaHy called The House of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of The 
Holy Gross, was founded in the 13th century by O&apos;Brien. It is supposed that this 
Friary was situated near Quay -lane ; but even a trace of it is not now to be found. 
The Knights Templars had an House near to the Augustinian Friary, of which 
the smallest remains are now not discoverable.&quot; Archdalfs Motiast. Hibern.

LISGOOL, in the Barony of Magheraboy, Co. of FERMANAGH, and Province 
of Ulster. &quot; In the early ages of Christianity, a Monastery was founded here, 
where we find the Festival of St. Aid, or Hugh, of Lisgovel, was observed on the 
25th of January. An Abbey, under the Invocation of the Virgin Mary, was 
afterwards founded here, and probably on the site of the ancient Monastery, for 
Regular Canons, following the rule of St. Augustin, by Mac Noellus Mackenlef&gt;King of Ulster, in the year 1106. This abbey having gone to ruin for want of 
necessary repairs, and Divine Service being totally neglected therein, the Abbot 
Cahill Mac Brian, Mac Cuchonnaght Maguire, entered into articles with Cuchon- 
naght Fitz-Cuchonnaght Maguire, lord of the Country of Fermanagh, to restore it 
to its pristine state. Maguire being grieved at seeing the church, which he and 
the principal people of the country had chosen for the place of their sepulture, so 
nearly demolished, requested the before mentioned Lord Abbot to surrender his 
title, and suffer him to provide another Order for the House, who should keep it in 
proper repair, and engage that there should be constantly Divine Service therein. 
The Abbot, together with the Bishop and Chapter, entered into an agreement which 
received the Confirmation of the Pope, who ordered the Franciscan Friars to take 



^ I 6 

possession of the abbey: and the Lord Maguire made a recompence to the Abbot 
I&apos;ahill, of ten dry Cows yearly, to him and his lineal heirs for ever. In this deed, a 
fine was ordered of cows to the O&apos;Hoxies and Mac Crifferties, the Poets, who 
were to reprove, infame and reprehend, in their satirick writings, every disturber or&apos; 
the Friars, otherwise the ordinary fine of 20 cows was to be levied out of their own 
proper .goods and lands. Maguire afterwards began to rebuild the Abbey in a 
most agreeable and eligible situation : but before the completion of the building,, 

the destroying powers of King Henry VIII overwhelmed it, in the year 1530 

It was granted to Sir John Davis, Knight.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. p. 263 

LISGOOLD, in the Barony of Barry more, Co. of CORK, and Province ot 
Munster : a V., united from time immemorial, and constituting with the Rectory 
and Vicarage of Ballintemple, the Rectory of Ballycaraney, the Rectory and 
Vicarage of Imphrick, and two thirds of the Rectory of Kilcredan, the Corps of 
the Precentorship of Cloyne, which is valued in the King&apos;s Books at ,3. sterling: 
and with which is holden, by Faculty, the Union of Clonmell : a Church, in repair, 
lately built at Lisgoold : no Glebe House: three Glebes; one, of 7 acres, at 
Cloyne ; another, of 2 acres, in two separate portions, at Ballintemple, and not far 
from the old church there : the third, of 3 roods, at Ballycaraney and Imphrick ; 
but none of these glebes are contiguous, or near the church of Lisgoold : Francis 
Atterbury, D. D., the Incumbent (in 1806), who has cure of souls, and is resident on 
bis other Benefice at Clonmell, about 7 miles from Lisgoold : the duties are chiefly 
performed by his Curate, The Rev. Mr. Pratt, at a Salary of 60. per annum. 
Lisgoold is in the Diocese of Cloyne, and Province of Cashel. It is 6| in. 
S. S. E. from Rathcormuck. The Fairs are holden on the 1st of May, 25th of June, 
1st of November, and 21st of December. The parishes of Lisgoold and Bally- 
caraney are contiguous, their extent being 6 miles from East to West, and 5 
miles from North to South. The other parishes of the Union of Lisgoold are 
in detached parts of the Diocese : Ballintemple being about 5 miles to the South ; 
Kilcredan about the same distance to the South East ; and Imphrick at least 
15 miles to the North West from Lisgoold. According to the Ecclesiastical 
Report, none of these Livings, taken separately, can afford comfort to an Incumbent, 
except, perhaps, Ballintemple, which might produce&lt;l 00. per annum, and yet leave 
enough to support the Precentorship from the four other parishes : It has also a 
Glebe, and might have a Church. See, Clonmell. 

LISKEEVY, in the Barony of Downamore, Co. of GALWAY, and Province of

an ancient Glebe, of 9 a. 3 r. 22 p., and a new Glebe, granted at a rent by The 
Right Hon. The Earl&apos;of Shannon, adjoining, of 32 a. Or. 18 p.: The Rev. Henry 
Jones, the Incumbent (in 1806), who has cure of souls, and is preparing to build 
a Glebe House : the duties are discharged by a Resident Curate. Lislee is in the 
Diocese of Ross, and Province of Cashel. It is 6 in. S. E. from Clognakilty. It 
is situate upon St. George&apos;s Channel. The parish of Kilsillagh is a very small 
piece of ground, entirely surrounded by the parish of Lislee ; the estimated 
extent of which is, including Kilsillagh, 4 miles from North to South, and H 
mile from East to West. The Rectory of Lislee is Impropriate in The Earl of 
Shannon. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, each of these parishes, separately, 
is too small to afford the means of comfort to a Resident Incumbent. 

LISMAKEERY, or, LISMACDIRY, in the Barony of Connello, Co. of LIMER- 
ICK, and Province of Munster : an entire Rectory, valued in the King&apos;s Books at 
,l. 7mA Money, being one of the parishes which constitute the Union of Askeaton. 
Lismakeery is in the Diocese of Limerick, and Province of Cashel. It is 5 m.

LISMALIN, in the Barony of Slewardagh and Compsey, Co. of TIPPERARY,

Vicarage of Ballingarry, and the Rectories and Vicarages of Modeshill, and 
Mowney : a Church, in good repair, at Lismalin : no Glebe House : a Glebe, of 
33 acres, at Modeshill : The Rev. James G. Fitzgerald, the Incumbent (in 1806), 
who has cure of souls, is resident in the adjoining parish, and performs the duties, 
assisted by a Curate. Lismalin is in the Diocese of Cashel, and Province of Cashel. 
It is 4 in. S. W. from Callan. Here are the ruins of a Castle. The parishes in 
the Union of Lismalin are contiguous ; that of Lismalin containing 2660 acres. 
According to the Ecclesiastical Report, the parish of Ballingarry should be 
separated ; and the other three parishes should be holden together. See, Ballin- 
garry. 

LISMORE, in the Barony of Coshmore and Coshbride, Co. of WATERFORD, 
and Province of Munster : a R. and V. : the Rectory has been united time out 
of mind, and probably at the first establishment of the Cathedral, to the Rectory 
ofMacollop: these Rectorial Tythes belong to the Oeconomy of the Cathedral 
of Lismore, and are appropriate for keeping the Cathedral in repair : the Vicarage 
has also been united, time out of mind, to the Vicarage ofMacollop: these Vicar- 
ial Tythes, valued in the King&apos;s Books at&lt;20. sterling, belong to the five 
Vicars Choral of Lismore : who are alleged to have the cure of souls, and they 
do not dispute it ; but, for the want of the Charter, this, as well as many other 
things concerning the Establishment of this Cathedral, cannot be ascertained : 
The Cathedral, at Lismore, is the only Church in the Union, (which from its ex- 



L I S 

tent requires at least two churches) ; And being in indifferent repair, is about to 
undergo a thorough renovation: no Glebe House, or Glebe: the duties are per- 
formed by one of the Vicars Choral, who always resides iu Lismore, at a Salary 
of&lt;50. per annum. The parishes in the Union of Lismore are contiguous, and 
are very large. Lismore is in the Diocese of Lismore, and Province of Cashe!. 
The Dean of Lismore has a Peculiar jurisdiction over the three parishes of Lismore. 
Tallow, and Macollop. It is 101 m. S. W. b. S. from Dublin. The Fairs art: 
holden on the 25th of May, and September, and l&lt;ith of November. It has six 
Post-days in the week. Here is a Free School. The Castle was built by King 
John, on the ruins of the Abbey of St. Carthagh: It belonged to the Duke of 
Devonshire, and gave birth to the great philosopher, Robert Boyle : It is boldly 
seated on the verge of a rocky hill, which rises almost perpendicularly, to a con- 
siderable height, over the River Blackwater. It was for many years an Episcopal 
residence, until Myler Magrath, Archbishop of Cashel, and Bishop of this See, 
granted the Manor of Lismore to that celebrated scholar and soldier, Sir Walter 
Raleigh, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, at the yearly rent of&lt;l3..&lt;5..8 : But 
this estate being lopped off with his head, in the reign of King James the First, 
it afterwards came into the hands of Sir Richard Boyle, who purchased all Sir 
Walter&apos;s lands. Here is a fine bridge over the River Blackzvatcr, which was 
erected at a very great expense by the Duke of Devonshire; and which is re- 
markable for the extent of its principal arch, the span of it being 90 feet. Below 
the town is a rich fishery for salmon, which is the greatest branch of trade here. 
The public road to Cork was formerly through this town. The Bishoprick of 
Lismore, according to Dr. Beaufort, was founded in the beginning of the Seventh 
century. It was united to the See of Waterford, in the year 1536&apos;. The Chapter 
of Lismore consists of a Dean (see, Tubrid), Precentor (see, Ardmore), Chancellor 
(see, Derrygrath\ Treasurer (see, Nezvcastle), and Archdeacon (see, Ballybacon\ 
and ten Prebendaries. The Cathedral is spacious, and handsome. There are 
some parts of the Diocese of Lismore 35 miles distant from the city of Waterford. 
See, Waterford.- &quot; Some writers affirm, that there was neither Church nor City 
here before the time of St. Mochuda; yet we find, that John was Bishop of Lis- 
more in the time of St. Senan, who lived about the year 540. An Hospital for 
Lepers was founded here under the Invocation of St. Brigid, to which several 
lands did belong, as appears from a Registry compiled some time after 1467, when 
the Master of the Hospital, styled Prior of Lismore, was in his 120th year: At 
the time of the general suppression, these lands were unknown. A Cell for an 
Anachorite, belonged to the church of Lismore, which was endowed with the 
lands of Ballyhaufy or Anchoret&apos;s town, a burgage in Lismore, six stangs of land, 
afield called Gortrimenyearty, and two small gardens, the whole of the annual 
value of 10.&quot; Arclidall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. pp, 6&apos;91. et seq. 

LISMULLEN, in the Barony of Skryne, Co. of MEATH, and Province of

Clonard. The Noblesse of Kinell-conuill (the county of Donegal) granted Dore- 
calgach to their relation St. Columb in the year 535; but as the Saint could not at 
that time be sixteen years old, the foundation of the Abbey cannot be placed before 
the year 546, when he may be supposed to have founded it for Canons Regular 
under the Rule of St. Augustin : This Abbey was a daughter of that of St. Peter

and St. Paul at Armagh, and was in after times dedicated to St. Cotumb himself: 
He is said by some to have made a pilgrimage to the Abbey of Glastonbury, in So- 
mersetshire, and there to have concluded his earthly pilgrimage, A. D. 597, in the 
76th year of his age : he was buried in the Abbey of Hy, but was afterwards re- 
moved to Downpatrick. The Registry of the Honour of Richmond says, that an

Turlogh Leinigh O&apos;Neil of Strabane. A Dominican Friary was founded here in 
the year 1274 by O&apos;Donell, the younger, Prince of Tyrconnell, at the request of

honour of the Virgin Mary, for Friars of the Order of St. Dominick, by O&apos;Ferrall, 
Prince of Annaly. On the 29th of January, 1615, King James I granted this Mon-

Walter de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, founded a Dominican Friary here. The walls of 
the church adjoining the village, and the greater part of the other buildings, are 
still entire. In 1688 this Friary was so complete, that a Provincial Chapter of the

LOUGH NEAGH, this great body of water, washes the shores of the Counties 
of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Londonderry, and Tyrone. According to Dr. Beau- 
fort, it is fifteen miles long, seven broad, and covers 58,200 acres. The River 
Bann is the only outlet for seven rivers and innumerable streams, that pour their 
tributary waters into this great Inland sea; which, though by far the largest, is by 
no means the most beautiful of the Irish lakes. The shores are mostly formed 
either by an inanimate strand, or marshy borders liable to frequent floods; and are, 
of course, deficient in those varied banks and bold promontories, without which 
such extensive sheets of water cannot have a picturesque effect, unless when the 
uniformity is broken by frequent Islands of different size and character: but there 
are only two in this Lake ; a very small one near the mouth of the Blackzeater, and 
Ram Island, within a short distance of the Antrim shore, remarkable only for an 
ancient Round tower. The views are more pleasing in Lough Beg, a small Lake, 
into which these waters again expand, after a course of about a mile through a 
very contracted channel. The form of Lough Beg, its Islands, some wooded 
points of land, with intervening lawns and rocks, the magnificent Rotunda at Bal- 
lyscullen, and the beautiful lightness of Toome-Bridge, produce the most happy 
effect. It would be unpardonable to omit, that Lough Neagh has been long cele- 
brated for a petrifying quality, which the water, or rather (it is said) the soil, 
possesses on some parts of the Antrim shore. 

LOUGH OUGHTER, in the Barony of Loughtee, Co. of CAVAX, and Prov- 
ince of Ulster. &quot; About the festival of Christmas, in the year 1237, or in 1249,

County of Roscommon, to Lough Oughter&apos;m the Brenie, Cathall O&apos;Reilly making 
a grant of the ground. The Abbey was dedicated to the Holy Trinity : and was 
granted, with all its possessions, by Queen Elizabeth, in 1570, to Hugh O&apos;Reilly 
of the Brenie, for the term of 21 years, at the rent of&lt;2..5..8 Irish Money.&quot;

dalfs Monast. Hibcrn. p. 585. 

MONAINCHA, in the Barony of Ikerin, Co/ of TIPPERARY, and Province of 
Munster. It is 3 m. S. E. from Roscrea. It is situate almost in the centre of the 
great Bog of Monela. &quot; The Monastery of Monaincha was originally an Abbey 



M O N 

of Culdean Monks, under the Invocation of St. Columba, whose Festival M&apos;as 
formerly celebrated there on the 15th of June. The situation chosen by these 
Religious was very singular. The Island, whereon the Monastery is built, consists of 
about two acres of dry ground ; all the surrounding parts being a soft morass, scarcely 
accessible by human feet, and yet, on this Isle stands the remains of a beautiful 
edifice; not large, but constructed in so fine a style, and with such materials, as 
excites our wonder how they could have been transported thither. The length of 
the Church is 44 feet, the width about 18 ; the arches of the Choir and the Western 
portal are semicircular, and adorned with a variety of curious mouldings ; the 
Windows were contrasted arches, such as appear over the West entrance to the 
church of St. Edmund&apos;s Bury, in Suffolk, but they are decaying, and some are 
fallen down. The antiquity of this Monastery is indisputable ; for it is mentioned 
by Giraldus Cambrensis, who came into Ireland in 1 185, as Preceptor and Secre-&apos; 
tary to King John, then Earl of Morton. He says this Island borders upon 
North Minister and the confines of Leinster, and that there a few Culdees, or 
Colidei, did devoutly serve God. To the East of the Abbey Church is a small 
Oratory, but no vestige of Monastic dwellings can be found on this Isle, save 
only the Abbey and the Abbot&apos;s room adjoining it, which was over the Cellars, 
and but small ; whatever others might have been, were probaly formed of wood, 
and in the lapse of many centuries have ceased to exist. Superstition established 
an opinion, so early as the age of Giraldus, that no person could die in this Isle 
let his malady be ever so extreme, or his fate ever so urgent : the merits of the 
Patron Saint and those of his Religious, secured this privilege to an Isle so favour- 
ed, and hence it acquired the appellation of Insula Viventium, or, The Island of 
the Living. This Legendary celebrity brought, from the remotest parts, innu- 
merable Pilgrims, to expiate their sins at the altar of St. Columba, and a gainful 
trade was carried on for more than Ten centuries; which enabled the monks to 
improve their Abbey and add such decorations as the fashion and taste of the day 
required : for we are not to suppose, that the present church is the same as the 
original, which was erected in the Seventh century ; that was probably of wood, 
in which state it continued till the invasion of the Ostmen, when a new style 
of Architecture commenced, and Montfincha was constructed of more durable 
materials. However, the salubrity and supernatural power of the Isle was not so 
great as to prevent the emigration of its Religious inhabitants to the main land. 
They found the &quot;noxious vapours of the surrounding marshes and swamps highly 
injurious to their constitutions, and they, as Ware informs us, fixed their residence 
at Corbally ; where is at this day, in good preservation, a small neat Chapel of a 
cruciform shape, with narrow slits for windows, and many other particulars 
indicating a respectable antiquity. By an inquisition taken, A. D. 1568, it was 
found that the Monastery of Canons Regular of the Virgin Mary, in the Island of 
the Living, otherwise called Inchenebo, was seized of the following lands ; 



M O N 

the Island, which contained three acres of moor, wherein were two Chapels ; 
and near the island, a Village, called Corballi, in which the Prior and Convent 
dwelt, where also was a Church, formerly the church of the Priory and Parish, 
and is still the parish churchy in this village were eight waste cottages, and 
the land which belonged to the priory consisted of 180 acres of arable and 
pasture, annual value 30s. ; 140 of unprofitable, and 16 acres of wood and under- 
wood, annual value&lt;0.,2..8,&amp;c. In the 28th of Queen Elizabeth, this Abbey 
was granted to Sir Lucas Dillon,&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. pp. 667- et seq. 

MONANIMY, in the Barony of Fermoy, Co. of CORK, and Province of 
Munster : a 11. and V., being one of the parishes which constitute the Union of

3 m. N. E. from Mallow. It is situate near the River Blaclavater. See, Coole. 
&quot; No mention is made by any of our writers of this Commanderv ; but at Mo-

MONASTERBOYCE, in the Barony of Fcrrard, Co. of LOOTH, and Province 
of Leinster : a Curacy, being one of the parishes which constitute the Union of 
Dunleer. Monasterboyce is in the Diocese of Armagh, and Province of Armagh. 
It is 2j m. E. S. E. from Collon. This parish contains 1000 acres of land. See, 

Dunleer &quot; Here we find a Religious house, which was anciently called Monaster- 

Bute, being founded by St. Bute, or Boetius, the son of Bronagh. Here are the 
ruins of two small chapels ; and although nothing remarkable is to be seen in 
their structure, yet do they evince the great antiquity of this foundation; near 
the West end of one of these chapels is a Round tower, 1 10 feet high, beautifully 
diminishing, in the manner of a Tuscan pillar, from a base of 18 feet : its circum- 
ference is seventeen yards, and the wall, built of a slaty stone of which the sur- 
rounding hills are composed, is three feet six inches thick, the door is five feet 
six inches in height, twenty-two inches in width, and six feet from the present 
level of the ground, it is arched and built of free-stone, as are the windows of the 
chapels ; in the inside the diameter is nine feet, and above the door it is divided 
into five stories, by rings of stone .slightly projecting. There are two large crosses 
on the South side of the church, the principal one is said to be of an entire stone, 
and is called St. Boyne&apos;s Cross, which is the most ancient Religious relique now 
extant in Ireland; the ornamental figures on it are rudely engraven, and at once 
show the uncivilized age in which they were executed ; there is also an inscrip- 
tion on this cross in the old Irish character, equally inelegant with the figures, 
some letters of which appear and evidently form the word Muredach, who was for 
some time King of Ireland, and died A. D. 534, about one hundred years after the 
arrival of St. Patrick. This Abbey continues to be a Burial-place of note,&quot; 
Archdali&apos;s Monast. Hibern. p. 490.

Should this Curacy be holden separately, it ought to be considerably augmented^ 
Monastereven is a Town of very great importance, having a flourishing trade, and 
a considerable Protestant population, with a very handsome Church. It is situate 
on the River Barrow. Here is a Nursery for 100 Children. &quot; St. Abban 
founded a sumptuous Abbey here, and granted to it the privilege of being a 
Sanctuary. At the general suppression, this Abbey was granted to George Lord 
Audley, who assigned the same to Adam Loftus, Viscount Ely. It afterwards 
came into the Earl of Droghctla&apos;s family, by whom it was beautifully repaired, 
still externally wearing the venerable appearance of an Abbey, which appellation 
it continues to support, and Moore Abbey is now the elegant seat of the present 
Ear]&quot;-Archdalfs Monast. Hibern. p. 333.

O&apos;Brien, who furnished it with Monks of the Cistertian Order from the Abbey of 
Mellifont, in the County of Louth. The Cell of Feal was afterwards annexed to

towering, having in the middle, between the body of the church and the chancel, 
an handsome but very narrow steeple, rising from a small arch to nearly the height 
of 60 feet, with off-sets between the sides. This building, we learn from the tradi- 
tion of the place, was committed to the flames by the Rochforts, a powerful family 
in this country. But some ruins, which remain, evince its extent and extraordin- 
ary workmanship, the whole being built of a blackish slate ; the East window, 
totally devoid of ornament, is still entire.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern, p. 726.

comfort to a Resident Incumbent. See, St. Mary&apos;s, Limerick. &quot; An Abbey was 
said to have been erected in the Fourth century, before the arrival of St. Patrick 
in Munster. It is, however, indubitable that St. Patrick placed St. Nessan here, 
Avho died A. D. 551. The Psalter of Cashel gives an incredible account of this 
abbey ; that it had within its walls six Churches, which contained, exclusive of 
Scholars, 1500 Religious; 500 of whom were learned Preachers, 500 Psalmists 
and the remaining 500 wholly applied themselves to Spiritual exercises. The 
ruins of this abbey may still be seen, consisting of the walls of a church, which 
by no means bespeak either antiquity, or its former splendour ; the East end is 
47 feet long by 16 feet broad, with a plain narrow window ; the centre, or nave, is 
33 feet by 28^, and the communication from this with the East end is by a small 
arch ; on the North side of the nave is a small porch or entrance; the West end is 
12 feet by 22, on the north side whereof is a small square tower, with ruined 
battlements ; there are no old tombs to be found here, but at a small distance 
North-east, are the walls of an old house, which probably made a part of the 
abbey.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hihcrn. p. 434.

de Rochfcrt, bishop of Meath, founded a Priory here, about the year 1206, for

into a Cathedral, which he dedicated to the honour of St. Peter and St. Paul. 
The Prior of this House was the third in Dignity, and sat as a Baron in the House 
of Lords. The remains of the large old church are still in being, where is also to 
be seen, an ancient tomb, said to have been placed there for a daughter of King

cation of St. John the Baptist, for Cross-bearers, or Crouched Friars, and the 
Bishops of Meath were either the founders, or great benefactors to this House. 
This priory stands on the South side of the river, a little below the abbey, and 
contiguous to the bridge. The ruins are extensive, though by no means remark- 
able for regularity of style, nor have they much appearance of a Religious founda- 
tion. A square Castle adjoins the bridge, from whence a regular range of building, 
along the water&apos;s edge, extends to another Castle at the East end, near which 
stands the East window of a small chapel, of a light triple form ; and on the road

Portarlington is in the Diocese of Kildare, and Province of Dublin. It is 36| m. 
W. S. W. from Dublin. It has six Post-days in the week. The Fairs are hoUkn 
on Easter-Monday, 22d of May, 12th of October, and 23d of November. This 
town sends one Member to Parliament; Patron, Lord Portarlington. It is hand- 
somely situate on each side of the River Barrow, which divides the town ; the 
greater part thereof being- in the Queen&apos;s County. The Magistrates are a Sovereign, 
two Portrieves, and a Recorder. It gives title of Earl to the family of Dawson. 
According to the Ecclesiastical Report, the parish of Lea cannot well be consid- 
ered without reference to the town of Portarlington. At Lea, two miles from 
Portarlington, there is a decayed old Church, which can scarcely be prevented by 
ordinary repairs from fulling. It is inconveniently situate for the town, and equally 
so for the numerous Protestant Inhabitants of the country. By a plurality of 
voices, at a late vestry, it has, therefore, been determined to change its site, and to 
re-build it still further from the town, by which means Portarlington, containing 
about 1500 inhabitants, will be in a worse state than it now is. In Portarlington 
there are two Chapels, and two Schools, endowed by the Earl of Gal way, in 
1702; one Chapel, and School, for Protestant French Refugees, and the 
like for the English Protestant Settlers and native Irish, on his Lordship&apos;s Estate. 
A rent-charge of&lt;40. per annum was settled on each Chaplain, .20. per annum on 
the English Schoolmaster, and .&apos;12, on the French master; and the Bishop of 
Kildare, the Diocesan, and his successors, were appointed trustees for ever. The 
chapels, and schools, with their endowments, were accordingly conveyed to the 
Bishop, for the time being, and shortly after, because there were many French 
Protestants in the place, a pension of 50. was granted to the French Chaplain, for 
the time being, which is enjoyed to this day. When the chapels were conveyed 
in trust to the Bishop, they were newly built ; repairs were little thought of; and 
the fund, provided for that purpose, was only a fine of 2,0., to be paid on the 
demise of each of three lives, on the perpetual renewal of which, the lands, charged 
with the above rent of .122., are holden for ever. At present there is one sum of 
^20. in hand, which bears interest : but, as the two Chapels are absolutely in 
ruins, and must be shortly altogether abandoned for want of necessary repairs, the 
Bishop considers himself (so far as the buildings are concerned) incapable of ful- 
filling the purposes of this trust. The Rectory of Lea is appropriate to the Dean 
and Chapter of Kildare. The Vicarage is endowed with one third of the tythes, 
and the Incumbent (in 1806), is The Rev. William Maunsell. Part of the town 
of Portarlington, situate in the King&apos;s County, and Parish of Clonchorke, must 



FOR 

also be considered on the occasion. The ancient site of Clonchorke Church is too 
remote from the town, which contains a great number of Boarding Schools, kept 
by very respectable persons, for children of both sexes ; and serious inconveniences 
must arise to such seminaries of Education, if the children be debarred from the 
exercise of Public worship.

here and also a Church, which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and the ori- 
ginal Patron Saints; at the same time they built a steeple, cemetery, and all other

of Quin are contiguous ; their estimated extent from North to South being 3 miles,

Incumbent. See, Ogashin, &quot;An Abbey was founded here early, which was con- 
sumed by fire A. D. 1278. The Monastery of Quin, for Franciscan Friars, was

describes its present state. &apos; Quiii is one of the finest and most entire Monast- 
eries that I have seen in Ireland: it is situated on a fine stream, with an ascent of 
several steps to the church ; at the entrance, one is surprised with the view of the 
High Altar entire, and of an Altar on each side of the arch of the chancel. To the 
South is a Chapel, with three or four Altars in it, and a very Gothic figure, in 
relief, of some Saint: on the North side of the chancel is a fine monument of the 
family of the Mac Namarras of Ranee, erected by the founder: on a stone by the 
High Altar, the name of Kennedye appears in large letters: in the middle, between 
the body and the chancel, is a fine tower built on the two gable ends. The clois- 
ter is in the usual form, with couplets of pillars, but is particular, in having but- 
tresses round it by way of ornament: there are apartments on three sides of it, the 
refectory, the dormitory, and another grand room to the North of the chancel, with 



R A G 

a vaulted room under them all: to the North of the large room is a closet, which 
leads through a private way to a very strong Round tower, the walls of which are 
near ten feet thick. In the front of the Monastery is a building, which seems to 
have been an apartment for strangers, and to the South-west are two other build- 
ings.&apos; &quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. p. 53.

copal Union prevents a Church from being built in Gallen, where it is greatly 
wanted, and has been repeatedly applied for by the parishioners; and as there be- 
longs to it an extensive Glebe, on which a House might be built. &quot; St. Regna-

R O S 

age a Castle was erected here, which was re-edified in 1268, by Sir Robert de Uf- 
tbrd, Justiciary of Ireland, and in 1271, it was razed to the ground. The first 
Religious foundation, which stands on record, is the Abbey of Regular Canons, 
founded by St. Coeman, the son of Faolchon, and a disciple of St. Finian ; he 
flourished, A. D. 540, when he wrote a rule for Monks, which was observed by 
most of these religious bodies in Connaught. The Dominican Friary was founded 
in the year 1253, or in 1257, by Felim, king of Connaught, who was interred here 
in 1265: his monument, in fine Irish marble, still remains, surrounded by his body 
guards in the dress of their time, but it has been lately much defaced. Tumul- 
tach O&apos;Conor, who was made Bishop of Elphin in 1246, and translated to Tuam in 
1259, consecrated the church of this Friary, which he dedicated to the honour of 
the Blessed Virgin. This Friary, and its possessions, were granted first to Sir 
Nicholas Malbye, Knight; and afterwards, on the 29th of January 1615, both the 
Abbey and Friary were granted to Francis Viscount Valentia. The Franciscan 
Friary was founded A. D. 1269; and in the following year it was totally destroyed 
by fire.&quot;Archdall&apos;s Monast. Hibern. pp. 618. et seq.

R O S 

resident, and performs the duties of Roscrea, and Kyle ; and his Curate, The Rev.

week. The Fairs are holden on the 7th of May, 21st of June, Sth of August, 9th 
of October, and 29th of November. Roscrea was once a Bishoprick, but was 
united to Killaloe in the Twelfth century. The large old castle was built by the 
Ormond Family. The parishes in the Union of Roscrea are contiguous : their 
estimated extent from North to South being 6 miles, and from East to West 7 
miles.&quot; St. Cronan, the son of Odran, built a Cell on a small Island in Loughkee, 
but finding that situation too retired, he erected a sumptuous Monastery (of 
Regular Canons) near the King&apos;s High-way, where a celebrated city afterwards 
sprang up, now only a small town, and called Roscrea. After the performance of 
many miracles, the holy and aged Founder of this House, ended an exemplary 
life on the I Oth of May, in the beginning of the Seventh century, and his feast 
(as patron of Roscrea,) is holden on the 8th of April. The present church is 
dedicated to St. Cronan; the front of it is very old, and consists of a door and two 
flat niches on either side, of Saxon architecture, with a mezzo relievo of the Patron 
Saint, much defaced by time ; at a little distance is a Cross in a circle, with a 
crucifix on one side, adjoining to which is a stone carved in various figures, and 
at each end a mezzo relievo of a Saint, both are called, if we mistake not, The 
Shrine of St. Cronan. To the North-west is a fine Round tower, 15 feet 
diameter, with two steps round it at the bottom ; about 15 feet from the ground 
is a window with a regular arch, and at an equal height is another window with 
a pointed arch. A Franciscan Friary was founded here, A. D. 1490, by Mulruany 
na Feasoige O&apos;Carrol, who married Bibiana, the daughter of O&apos;Dempsey. Others 
inform us, that Bibiana herself was the founder after she became a widow; the 
Cloister, however, could not have been built till after that time, as appears from 
an inscription, which was formerly in this Friary. This Building was situate on 
the River, at the North-west part of the town, and the remains are in good 
preservation.&quot; Archdalfs Monast. Hibern. p. 672.

the Biahoprick of Cork. The length of the principal part of the Diocese of Ross,

R O S 

grew up here, in which there was always a large Seminary of Scholars. This 
Monastery has been generally given to the Regular Canons following the Rule of 
St. Augustine; but it appears, from the two instruments published by Hugh

age. The Abbey of Canons Regular was founded, in a very early age, on the 
hill at some distance from the hermitage, and was remarkable for being many 
years the residence of a Royal prince. In the year 1512, it appears to have been 
re-built for Friars of the third Order of St. Francis, by Christopher Fleming, 
Knight, Lord of Slane, and Elizabeth Stuckle his wife. In the present remains of 
Lord Slane&apos;s building are several fragments of the ancient Abbey, and many of the 
architraves were evidently cut out of the ornamental parts, particularly one with 
the appearance of a head crowned. A spacious Castle was erected here by the 
Lord of Slane, who being afterwards engaged in the great rebellion in 1641, the 
estate vested in the Crown : and The Right Honourable William Conyngham, 
who at present possesses this beautiful seat, is now employing (in 1786) every 
aid of architecture and design in rendering it a truly elegant residence.&quot; Arch-

attribute this foundation to O&apos;Connor (Lord of) Sligo. At the general suppression, 
this Friary was granted to Sir William Taafe. The few ruins of this spacious and 
beautiful monastery evince its former splendour. Three sides of the Cloister may

dinary workmanship, and a few of the pillars are ornamented with Sculpture. The 
great East window is beautiful, and the High Altar, adorned with relievos in the 
Gothic style, is now so overwhelmed with hones and skulls, (the quantity, as we

and supported by pillars of stone about four feet distant from each other. In the 
corner, to tlie right as you look towards the Altar, is the Tomb of O&apos;Conor, with 
the figures of himself and Lady, and an inscription now almost defaced. Here 
are also several vaults and cells, and the tower in the centre is pretty entire, 
except the battlements. This great and curious monument of antiquity seems to 
have fallen a prey rather to the devouring teeth of time than to the hands of 
man; although Cromwell is said to have done some injury to \l. n ArchdaWs-

a considerable time as a garrison. The Gray Friary was dedicated to St. Bonaven- 
ture, and in general was called, The Observanrine Friary of Trim ; it was originally 
founded by King John; though others say by the family of Plunket. This Friary 
is totally demolished, and the present Session-house is erected on part of the ancient 
foundation. Father Richard Plunket, who wrote an Irish Dictionary, now in the 
Public Library of Dublin, resided in this convent. The Dominican Friary, situated 
near the gate leading to Athboy, was founded in honour of the Virgin Mary, A. D. 
]65, by Geoffrey de&quot; Geneville, Lord of Meath. The Priory of Crossbearers was 
dedicated to St. John the Baptist; one of the Bishops of Meath was said to be 
the founder, and his successors in that See were great benefactors to this Priory. 
We are told, that this was a truly magnificent building: and it is probable, that 
the Parliaments of Trim were holden in the great hall of this house : the walls are 
still in being. Here was a Convent of Nuns. There was an ancient Church here, 
called The Church of the Grecians ; which may be some proof that the Grecians of 
old made a settlement in this kingdom. We also find, in the parish church of St. 
Patrick in this town, a Perpetual Chantry of three Priests.&quot; Archdall&apos;s Monast.

Virgin Mary, and owes its foundation to Geoffry de Constantine (one of the ear- 
liest English emigrants) in or soon after the days of King Henry the Second. This 
magnificent and beautiful edifice, in the form of a cross and of a considerable 
extent, was built of a blackish stone, and the steeple was remarkable, being an 
octagon erected on the top of a square tower, which, though mutilated, was, in 
the year 1780, 74 feet high, the columns were also octagon with plain capitals.

in the Kingdom, extending over a great part of the Counties of Galway, and 
Mayo, and including a part of Roscommon. It is upwards of 60 miles long, and

TUB 

Deanery alone is in the patronage of the Crown ; 79 parishes are in the Bishop&apos;s 
Gift: and 10 are united to the Wardenship of Gahvay. The Constitution of that 
large and ancient Collegiate Church is unique in this kingdom; the Warden and 
three Assisting Vicars being elected by the Mayor and Corporation ; the Warden 
annually, and the Vicars for life. In the little City of Tunm there is a very neat 
but small Cathedral, which is also the parish church. The Bishop&apos;s Palace is a 
large antique fabric; from which no part of this extensive Diocese is 50 miles 
distant. The extent of the Union of Tuam is about 8 miles in length, and about 
6 miles in breadth : Liskeevy is distant from the other parishes about 5 miles. 
&quot; We are told that an Abbey was founded here, so early as the year 487, under 
the Invocation of the Virgin Mary. St. Jarlath is said to have made it a Cathedral 
in the beginning of the Sixth century ; and it is also said that a City was built here 
in honour of this exemplary Bishop. His remains were preserved at Tuam, in a 
Chapel, called Temple-na-scrin, i. e., The Church of the Shrine. The Priory of 
St. John the Baptist was founded about the year 1140, by Tirdelvac O&apos;Connor, 
king of Ireland. We cannot say to what Order this House did belong, but find 
that it was granted to Richard Earl of Clanrickard. The Abbey of the Holy 
Trinity was founded by one of the family of Burgh, either in the reign of King 
John, or in the beginning of King Henry III, for Premonstre Canons.&quot; Arch-

Costetlo, and became Lords of the Barony ; The followers of St. Dominick seated 
themselves here in the year 1430, without a licence from the Pope, but they ob- 
tained one from Eugene IV, who made a grant of the same, by a Bull bearing 
date the 18th of March, 1434. Urlare, or in Irish, Orlare, which signifies an 
Area, is in a retired situation, and was therefore appointed for the general recep- 
tion of Novices throughout the Province of Connaught. We are told, that, in an- 
cient times, there was a Town here, but at present there is not a vestige of one to

depth for vessels to sail through at any time of the tide. Oliver Cromwell had 
forts erected upon both ends of it, which have gone to ruin since his time. It

The Cathedral Church, in repair: a Deanery House. 

The Parishes of Trinity, St. Michael&apos;s, and St. Olave&apos;s, are all Within the City of 
Waterford, and make about two-thirds of it: they are united to the entire Rectories 
of Kilburne, and Kilcaragh, and part of the Rectories of Kilmeaden, and Reisk, 
constituting the Corps of the Deanery of Waterford, which is valued in the King&apos;s 
Books at ,20. Irish Money: and to Avhich Corps, the entire Rectory of Kill- 
oteran was last Episcopally united, on the 22d of December 1 804, when the pre- 
sent Dean became Incumbent; and it appears, that it has been united in the same 
manner, for time immemorial : two Glebes; one, of 376 a. 3 r. 10 p., belonging to 
the Deanery, at Ballycasheen, in the parish of Kilburne, .with several Cabbins on 
the land: the other, of 17 acres, at Kilcaragh ; these Glebes are distant from each

in common. There are no Tythes from the other two City parishes. The parishes in 
this Union are all contiguous; the remotest of them not being four miles distant from 
theCityof Waterford. The parishes of St. Peter, St.Pa trick, St.Stephen, and St. John, 
are all contiguous, and comprehend about one-third of the whole city of Waterford: 
they constitute the Corps of the Archdeaconry, which is valued in the King&apos;s Books 
at 6. Irish Money, and were probably united at the same time when the Deanery 
was established : a Glebe, of a few perches, behind the church of St. Patrick: 
The Rev. George Lewis Fleury, LL. D., the Incumbent (in 1806)&gt;who has cure 
of souls, is resident in the city, and performs the duties in person. According to 
the Ecclesiastical Report, the value of these four Livings is under&lt;200. per annum; 
and are conceived to be of too small value to afford comfort to the Incumbent. 
There is also a French Church in the City of Waterford, endowed by Government 
with 50. per annum : of which The Rev. Peter Augustus Franquefort is Incum- 
bent (in 1806) : has not cure of souls : is resident, and performs the duties in per- 
son : It has neither Glebe House, or Glebe Land. Waterford is in the Diocese 
of Waterford, and Province of Cashel. The Hon. and Right Rev. Power French 
le Poer, D. 1). and LL. D., Lord Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, in 1802. It 
is 74 m. S. S. W. from Dublin. It has six Post-days in the week. The Fairs are 
holden on the 4th of May, 24th of June, and 25th of October. This City sends 
one Member to Parliament; the Electors being, Freemen and Freeholders. It 
was originally built in the year 879, but destroyed, in 981 : It was considerably 
enlarged by Earl Strongbow, in 1171; and still further, in the reign of King 
Henry the Seventh, who granted divers privileges to the citizens. King Richard 
the Second landed, and was crowned here, in 1399. In 1690, King James the 
Second embarked from hence for France, after the Battle of the Boyne. King 
William the Third resided here twice, and confirmed its Privileges. Here is a 
Charter School, for 60 Boys. The Members of the Corporation consist of a 
Mayor, Recorder, two Sheriffs, 18 Aldermen, and 19 Assistants, a Town Clerk, 
Coroner, Clerk of the Crown and Peace, Mareschal, Searcher, Public Notary, 
Water-Bailiff, Sword-Bearer, four Serjeants at Mace, and other Officers. The 
Privileges of their Charter are very extensive. The City of Waterford is 
well built, and contains about 35,000 souls. It stands on the South side 
of the River Suir, which is embanked by a very noble Quay, extending the 
whole length of the Town : Vessels of great burden can come up to this Quay, 
but the largest ships generally lie a few miles lower down: a very flourishing 
commerce with England, and other countries, is the happy consequence of such a 
situation. The principal articles of Export are beef, pork, butter, grain, and 
linen. Packet-boats are also established between this Port, and Milford Haven 
in South Wales, for the convenience of the South of Ireland. As there is no 
bridge over the Suir below Carrick, the only communication with the County of 

4 u 



WAT 

Kilkenny is by a Ferry, an inconvenience to which the great depth and breadth 
of the river has hitherto compelled the inhabitants to submit. This city is about 
twelve miles distant from the Sea: The harbour runs almost twelve miles up the 
country, nearly in a straight line, and is all the way deep and clear. Here arc 
several Charity Schools, and Humane Foundations, well supported: Many of the 
public edifices are extremely elegant : The private dwellings are generally 
modern, and with the other improvements of the city, keep pace with the increase 
of its opulence. It gives title of Viscount to the family of Lumley, that of Earl to 
the family of Talbot, and thatof Marquess to the Earl of Tyrone. The See of Water- 
ford (which is valued in the King&apos;s Books at&lt;72. .8.. 1 Irish Money,) was united, 
according to Dr. Beaufort, in the year 1536, to the See of Lisrnore : The Bishoprick 
of Lismore had been founded in the beginning of the Seventh century ; but that of 
Waterford was not established until the Eleventh, when the Ostmen or Danes settled 
on the Irish Coast. This very small Diocese is confined to the Eastern part of the 
County of Waterford, and does not extend above 10 miles in length, and 7 miles 
m breadth. But the Diocese of Lismore is 30 miles long, and about 29 miles broad, 
including the greatest part of the County of Waterford, and a considerable portion 
of that of Tipperary. The Union stretches in length 39 miles from East to West, 
and 29 miles in breadth. The Chapter of Waterford consists only of the Dean, 
Precentor (see, Kilbarrymeaden), Chancellor (see, Monemointer}, and Treasurer 
(see, Lisnakil[}, for there are no Prebendaries, and the Archdeacon has not a vote. 
The Cathedral of Waterford is a very elegant church, erected within a few years. 
The Bishop&apos;s Palace, which stands close by it, is a handsome modern structure 
of no great size, and very much confined in situation. &quot; The Priory of St. 
Catherine is the first House of Religion which appears ; it was founded by the 
Ostmen for Augustinian Canons of the Congregation of St. Victor, but we know 
not at what period. The Hospital of St. Stephen, in St. Stephen&apos;s Street, was 
founded for Lepers, and endowed by the Power family. This Hospital must have 
been erected before the Benedictine Abbey, for John Earl of Morton, in his Charter 
to that Abbey, confirmed the Leper-House to the Poor of the City. John Earl of 
Morton arrived in Waterford, A. D. 1 185, when he founded the Priory of St. John

Benedict, and confirmed to them the lands of Ballyowedin. In the Charter he 
calls it his Aims-House, and makes it a Cell to the Abbey of St. Peter and St. 
Paul in the City of Bath, Somersetshire. Peter de Fonte was a munificent Bene- 
factor to this House. The Friars Preachers, or Dominicans, were introduced into 
this city, A. D. 1226. And upon application of the Citizens to King Henry 
III, on the 20th of February, he granted his Royal approbation, that their intend- 
ed house should be buift on that waste piece of ground, late the site of an ancient 
tower. The building was accordingly begun, and concluded. The steeple was 
a very strong building, and the Monastery (of St. Saviour), now the County 



WES 

Court-house, is called Black Friars. A Friary was founded, in 1240, for Con- 
Ventual Franciscans by the Lord Hugh Purcel, who was interred in the same 
year, on the right hand of the High Altar. The steeple is still entire, and, 
with the rest of the Abbey, is constantly kept in repair. Here are several 
ancient Tombs, on one is the figure of a man in armour, in high relief, with 
a shield on his left arm, on which are three Lions passant guardant in pale, 
but no inscription (this was the monument of the Founder). The Holy Ghost 
Hospital has been since erected on part of the ruins of the Friary.&quot; Archdalfs

simplicity of manners. &quot; A. Priory of Regular Canons, called also The Priory of 
St. Peter and St. Paul of Selsker; the Danes are said to have been the founders,

The Prior sat in Parliament as a Baron. The church yet remains with a very 
large tower in the centre. The Priory of the Knights Hospitallers, founded by 
William Mareschal Earl of Pembroke, and dedicated to St. John and St Brigid, 
was, antecedent to the Templars&apos; abolition, the grand Commandery ; but on the 
total suppression of those Knights, the consequence of this Priory gradually dimin- 
ished, and the Preceptory of Kilmainham being granted to the Hospitallers, it 
immediately became the Grand Commandery of their Order. There still remains 
part of the old church of St. John without the town walls. The Conventual Fran- 
ciscans procured a settlement for themselves in this town in the reign of King 
Henry III, and were reformed A. D. I486. Here was also an Hospital for Lepers.&quot;
