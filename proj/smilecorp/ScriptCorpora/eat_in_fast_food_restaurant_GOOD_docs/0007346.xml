County Says It Must Dump Garbage Deal
 
Contract Called `Worst In Country&apos;
 By Robin Pollack sentinel correspondent 
 September 9, 1998 
TAVARES - Angry that residents and businesses are facing higher garbage rates to run Lake&apos;s controversial trash-burning plant, county leaders are demanding a new deal to replace an incinerator contract they say stinks.

County commissioners called Tuesday for renegotiating the costly contract before deciding how to boost trash disposal fees to raise millions of dollars more to help pay for the Ogden Martin waste-to-energy plant in Okahumpka.
 
It&apos;s a deal commission Chairman Richard Swartz called ``probably the worst incinerator contract that exists in this country today.&apos;&apos;

Under the current contract, the incinerator - which cost $79 million to build in 1991 - will end up costing taxpayers $140 million, including debt interest payments, when the last bill comes due in 2013. The plant was built with industrial bonds and is being paid off by garbage customers and county taxpayers, who won&apos;t even own the incinerator once the tab is paid.

To fund the plant, folks here already pay much higher trash-disposal bills than those in neighboring counties. That fuels the problem: Some businesses and haulers are smuggling trash out of Lake to avoid paying the disposal cost, or tipping fee, of $84.15 a ton, county officials contend. County residents, meanwhile, pay $83.24 a year for garbage service.

And now, the county is being forced to determine how to increase those fees and figure out ways to collect enough garbage from commercial businesses to feed the trash-burning plant, commissioners complained during Tuesday&apos;s two-hour workshop.

``We all need to be back at the table looking at a new contract ... that&apos;s more equitable to the citizens of Lake County,&apos;&apos; Commissioner Catherine Hanson said. She called the current contract ``very punitive&apos;&apos; to Lake&apos;s residents and businesses.

Added Swartz: ``Serious negotiations need to take place with Ogden Martin to revise this contract to in some way be consistent with realities, because it is not now.&apos;&apos;

By 2013, said Swartz, ``we still would have paid for this thing and not own it.&apos;&apos;

Following the meeting, Mark Ervin, Ogden Martin&apos;s regional business manager, said his company ``understands the issues and concerns of Lake County, and we&apos;re going to work with them to help solve their problems.

``It&apos;s going to be a long process, but we just have to see what the county wants to do, and get down to the details of it and go from there,&apos;&apos; Ervin said.

In the meantime, commissioners want experts to further analyze the amount of garbage generated by residents and businesses, and how much of that trash is actually disposed of in Lake County. That will help county leaders decide their options, which include:

A commercial container program that requires businesses to obtain a bin for their trash. Local haulers would pick up the trash and bring it to the incinerator. This idea was recommended in May by the county&apos;s solid waste advisory board. Current monthly container fees are $20.59 to $25.51 per cubic yard; that would increase to $32 to $49.
 
The problem with this idea is that businesses could divert trash as recycling. Lake already loses more than 30,000 tons of recycling per year to other counties, said Don Post, county director of waste services. That recycling would have raised $3.8 million in Lake had it been collected as trash, Post said.

Increasing the current $84.15 per ton tipping fee to $93-$183 per ton. However, such whopping fees likely would drive customers away to other counties with lower fees. Orange County&apos;s tipping fee is $30.65 per ton, Seminole&apos;s $36 and Brevard&apos;s $29.

Consultant David Greene with Glace&amp;Radcliffe Inc., an engineering firm that presented a review Tuesday of Lake&apos;s commercial solid waste rates, called this option ``the worst-case scenario.&apos;&apos; He said such high rates leave ``very little assurance people will continue to use this system.&apos;&apos;

Charging commercial businesses property taxes for solid waste services. That rate could range from $1 to $1.43 per $1,000 of assessed property value. However, such a tax couldn&apos;t be limited to commercial users, Greene said: ``You&apos;d have to put this property tax on everybody in the county.&apos;&apos;

Charging a commercial fee for solid waste services. Residents already pay a uniform yearly fee. However, a complex rate structure would be needed for commercial assessments to ensure fairness. A slate of uniform rates that depend on building size wouldn&apos;t work, officials say. For example, a small fast-food restaurant generates much more trash than a larger church building. Variable rates could range from 5 cents to $2.89 per square foot, depending on how the commercial building is used.

Finally, the county will need a legal analysis of all the options. For instance, because of recent judicial rulings, Lake County can&apos;t force big trash haulers to bring trash to the incinerator.

``This is a very unpleasant task to determine which way we&apos;re going to raise these fees,&apos;&apos; Post said.
