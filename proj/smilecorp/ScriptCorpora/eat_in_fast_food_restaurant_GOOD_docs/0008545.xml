 This Page Contains Valuable Information, Books and Tools to 
Open, Own,&amp;Operate a Profitable Restaurant, Food Truck or Catering Operation. 
 Worksheets and Costs Associated with Startup, plus FoodService Equipment and 
Supply Requirements 
 
 These are a few of the Steps that you should take when 
considering opening a Restaurant or Bar. 
 First 
 Design your Menu 
 Determine Recipes, Food Costs , 
and Equipment Specifications.  You do not want a 35# electric fryer 
if you sell a lot of fried food. You won&apos;t get enough production to cover 
a four seat restaurant, and the recovery time on the fryer will be much too long 
to get out a second batch of food. When buying equipment Don&apos;t be Penny 
Wise and Pound Foolish. Many operators save a few dollars on their core 
pieces of equipment only to find out that it costs them thousands in lost 
revenue once they open for business. Clarify your concept and put all the 
proposed details--from decor to dessert choices--in writing. If you can&apos;t write 
about them, they need more thought.

 Second 
 Business 
Plan 
 Most Successful FoodService Operators STRONGLY RECOMMEND putting together a Business Plan BEFORE making any kind of monetary investment. Without a GOOD Business 
Plan you could lose Tens of Thousands of Dollars. If you can successfully 
create a Detailed Business Plan, you have gotten past your Second Hurdle.  Opening a Restaurant or Other Food Business Starter Kit: How to

 Third 
 Financing 
 Even people with a lot of experience in the FoodService Business Lose their 
Shirts. The primary reason for this is Under Capitalization. Make 
sure that you have enough money to operate your restaurant for Six Months to One 
Year without making a profit.   Check

 Fourth 
 Licensing and Regulations 
 If you plan on selling Alcohol, make sure that you fully 
understand, and are prepared (Financially&amp;Personally) to meet State, County, 
and City Regulations. Research Local FoodService Establishment 
Requirements&amp;Health Code Regulations BEFORE looking for a property. This 
will give you the ability to intelligently negotiate a Lease Agreement. Look very carefully at the property to make sure that there will not be any 
MAJOR changes required to the physical plant by the local Health Department. Even if the location was a restaurant previously, does NOT mean that it meets 
current Regulations. Many people have found out after they signed their 
lease that they would need to spend $5,000.00 to $15,000.00 to upgrade the 
Greasetrap and Septic Tank Systems. 
 
 Business Licenses&amp;Incorporations 
 BizFilings is an online provider of incorporations and 
other products for small businesses, such as business licenses and Federal Tax 
ID obtainment. Visit www.BizFilings.com or call 800-981-7183 ( Reference Code A1813 ) 
  
 Fifth 
 Get a professional Contractor 
 One that can stick to a schedule and is familiar with local 
regulations and inspectors. Don&apos;t rely on your cousin Ernie just because 
he has built a few Houses. Everyday that you go over schedule will cost 
you Thousands of Dollars in Operating Expenses and Lost Sales . 
 
 Sixth 
 Shop for Goods and Services 
 Once you have gotten past these hurdles, you can start pricing 
the equipment, Smallwares, Goods, and Services that will go into your operation. 
 
 Smallwares Requirements Cost Worksheet.xls 
 This is a (relatively) complete list of supplies needed to open a 100 seat restaurant. If your 
restaurant has 75 seats, multiply the total listed by .75, If your restaurant 
has 187 seats, multiply total listed by 1.87 etc.
