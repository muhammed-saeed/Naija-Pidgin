Cocomero? Oh, so THAT&apos;S what it&apos;s called! I always called it &quot;The Froyo Place.&quot;

Cocomero&apos;s shop is bright, lively and clean with great music, like I expect all business to be. The shop has a wide array of yogurts and toppings, but admittedly, I stay true to the ube (taro root) ice cream. Put some peanuts and chocolate fudge (located on the side of the toppings stand) and there you have it-- MY perfect froyo.  Plus, the people are pleasant. One tiny criticism is that they don&apos;t have whip cream there. It would exponentially take the yogurt to HNL (&apos;hol nubba lebel-- sorry, corny MadTV joke). Nevertheless, I love this place. It&apos;s a great addition to Champaign and my afternoon strolls at UIUC. Mahal!

Took the family to get some ice cream and came across this place. The workers were very helpful on helping my family on getting started.

The ice cream was great and also the price. Great to take the kids to get some deserts on a hot day.

Ohhhh, I went here my first weekend in Chambana and I&apos;ve been craving it every night ever since...

It was fairly busy, but kept very clean. Staff was very friendly. And the frozen yogurt... ohhhh it was good! Tons of flavors (I recommend Red Velvet and Cafe au Lait (sp?)) and a bunch of tasty toppings. The strawberry poppers are worth a try for sure.

Yogurt is priced out by weight. I got a good sized cup of yogurt for around five bucks. I&apos;m definitely going to be returning for more!!

This place is great. When springtime rolls around, I always gotta get my coco fix and sit on the quad. This is a super popular place among students at U of I. The staff is friendly. The interior is modern and yogurt flavors change depending on the season. My favorite flavors are red velvet cake, mango and taro. There are a large varieties of toppings as well. I always end up putting mochi, cap&apos;n crunch, mango, kiwi and strawberries on mine. I tend to lose control when I go in and my totals are always at least $5 ahhh. Totally worth it though!

A visit to campus wouldn&apos;t be complete without a Cocomero encounter.

I could see how this how this would be a campus staple with its bright interior, selections of self serve flavors and toppings.

I got a mix of taro, vanilla, and green tea with some fruit. They were all pretty decent, but no where close to the taste and textures of my favs like Pinkberry or Yogen Fruz.

Overall, good place to stop in for a froyo fix, or hangout while experimenting with all of their offerings.

Great selection of flavors and awesome toppings bar!

The cups are deceivingly oversized so you&apos;ll probably not want to fill to the top -- it can get expensive AND you&apos;ll have far more than you want to consume! As with similar places, it&apos;s a flat pay-by-weight. It&apos;s a reasonable enough stop on campus.

Can get busy, but plenty of seating upstairs overlooking the Alma Mater.

So many frozen yogurt flavors to choose from and a fantastic selection of both fruit and sweet toppings. The yogurt itself and the available toppings are always fresh and delicious.

I was so excited when they added bubble teas, shaved ice, and coffees to their menu. The boba in the bubble tea are always cooked perfectly (chewy and slightly sweet); a great texture and flavor.

You can combine the different fruit flavors together to create your own unique bubble tea (mango-lychee-and-strawberry = yums!) or even get the almond, milk, or tarot teas HOT! I cannot tell you how many times that my boyfriend and I have made a trip in the freezing Champaign winter to Cocomero just to get our hands on the yummy hot tarot bubble tea. So delicious!

Every time I am back on campus, Cocomero is a MUST! The owners and staff are also fantastic. They are friendly, professional, and keep the place SPOTLESS. The bathrooms are also impeccably clean as well.

Oh how can I describe my love for Cocomero...this place is just amazing!  It&apos;s sort of a build-your-own frozen yogurt shop.  There are an array of machines along the wall with different flavored frozen yogurts (personally I love the cheesecake flavored, can you say YUM!)  Also there&apos;s a lot of different toppings like fruits, nuts, sprinkles etc. you can use to create your own frozen yogurt.  Prices are figured out at the end, based on the weight of your experimental concoction.

This place is the best. Nearly a dozen flavors, more than a handful of toppings, and the ability to decide how much you want! The location is amazing and the business is always clean. The only complaint about this place is that I never know to whether to mound my bowl with fruit or bury my frozen yogurt with brownies, cheesecake, chocolate and other fine delicacies.

This is one of those places that you get what you pay for - literally!

From what I recall the frozen yogurt was fine, nothing spectacular, perhaps too sweet for my taste, but what bugs we about this place is that everyone hovers around and comes into contact with the yogurt and toppings. If you don&apos;t mind sharing the machines and the toppings bar with a bunch of filthy snot-nosed anoose picking kids then perhaps this place is just for you.  I greatly preferred the taste and cleanliness of berri.

Saturday afternoon it was busy but the staff kept the toppings stocked and the toppings bar/floor clean. The fruit looked fresh and there were many options for the frozen yogurt. Opted for mango + peach - toppings: mini cheesecake bites, strawberries, mangos, and tapioca lookalike juice filled balls that pop in your mouth. Not a cheap treat approx $5 (it is by weight) but a fun occasional treat.

Clean, good toppings, fro yo quality seems good, service is quick/friendly/easy.

I&apos;m in a Master&apos;s program at U of I and I have to drive down to Champaign once a semester. The highlight is usually Coco Mero, which is an absolutely delicious frozen yogurt place. They have mochi and red bean, which I apply liberally to my yogurt. I also like that they have lactose free varieties that don&apos;t upset my stomach. It&apos;s a bit pricey (i usually don&apos;t get out of there spending less than $6) but it&apos;s totally worth a splurge every now and then.
Pineapple frozen yogurt + blackberries + mochi + red bean = wonderful.

Ever since I visited a friend at U of I and we went here, I can&apos;t stop raving about it!

I loved the variety of self-served frozen yogurt, huge machines lined against a wall. From different cheesecake flavors, to the simplest vanilla. The amount of different toppings was also insane! Everything tasted sooo good, mmmmm.

The prices were also pretty good, especially compared to other yogurt shops.

The atmosphere in the place is also great! There is lounge type seating upstairs, with tables and couches and egg-shaped chairs.

Too bad I haven&apos;t been able to find such a good frozen yogurt place where I live.

Cocomero is a nice little treat on a hot summer day.  The atmosphere is bright and fun, and there&apos;s always enough seating.
I&apos;ve gone here a couple of time and each time I got a few different flavors. Both times my cup was around $5, but it depends on how much you put in there.  If you fill the entire cup I can easily see someone paying $10 for froyo.
The red velvet and cheesecake flavors are probably the most popular, and they are definitely yummy.  I also tried a few of the fruit flavors last time and they were all pretty good.  The mango was a little underwhelming, but the peach was good, and so was the pomegranate.
I added some fruit on top, which seemed really fresh.  They also have candy toppings and coconut and cheesecake bites, stuff like that.
Overall, I would definitely recommend stopping here next time it&apos;s 90 degrees outside. Or even when it&apos;s not...

So I was a bit sad when Moonstruck was no longer in this location. And then I discovered that Cocomere was a pay by the oz frozen yogurt place. Sad no longer.

The interior is nice and bright and happy, which is also how I feel when I grab my cup and start loading up on flavors. I&apos;m a Libra. We&apos;re indecisive people. So when I&apos;m able to select 4 different yogurt flavors, and 10 different toppings and still only pay about $6 for a ginormous cup, life is happy. I am happy.

On a sweltering day like today in Chicago, I am so tempted to drive down to Chambana and indulge myself. It&apos;s that good (that and Chicago SUCKS for the lack of pay by the oz fro yo). Yum.

Red Mango cannot compete. Cocomero has a great selection of yogurt flavors with varying fat content and an amazing toppings bar.

I love that it&apos;s self-serve. I almost always want to fill the cup because it&apos;s so delicious, but it&apos;s nice to have the option of getting less.

I tend to either get all fruity flavors (mango, peach) topped with yogurt chips and blueberries (which are big and plump), or get richer flavors (red velvet, cheesecake) topped with yogurt chips and cheesecake bites. They rotate their specialty flavors, which is sometimes sad if one on rotation is your favorite - last week they had taro, which is a root vegetable popular in Hawaiian cuisine. I&apos;d had it fried like potato chips before, but it was AMAZING as fro-yo!

Yummm. Nice selection of flavors and toppings. The Red Velvet Cake frozen yogurt is really good. I was skeptical so I added a few stripes in with some French Vanilla.

Loaded it up with mango, red bean, MOCHI(fav), graham cracker crumbs, two cherries,&amp;butterscotch if I can remember clearly.

Yeah. It can be a bit expensive if you don&apos;t watch your portions..
Alla that and I was near 5 bucks and only had half a cup.

You can weigh your cup as you go though by the cashier. I wish I&apos;d realized that the first time.

Don&apos;t forget that you need to pay meter to park. They accept nickels, dimes,&amp;quarters.

I don&apos;t live in Champaign, but whenever I come to visit my boyfriend, I HAVE to come here (usually more than once). They keep a variety of flavors (my favorites are red velvet cake and original tart), and you can mix and match as many as you like (as it&apos;s all pay-by-the-weight). The topping bar includes everything from cereal to fresh fruit, cheesecake bits to mochi balls.

The decour is wacky and fun, and the staff is friendly enough....but the yogurt would make it worth it no matter what!!!

For the price, this place is not bad at all. I paid 5 dollars and had so many toppings I didn&apos;t know what to do with them or which to eat first.

I had cheesecake frozen yogurt and of course the original. Topped with...get ready for this: cheesecake, reeses, graham, strawberries, mangos, pineapples, and more cheesecake so much toppings and yogurt that I had to share.

Definitely the talk of the town...then again, this may be their only yogurt place... doesn&apos;t compare to joy yees plus, but good for the price you pay and tastey

I see why this place is always so hopping. Very good quality frozen yogurt, and it&apos;s self serve, so you can get exactly what you want. You enter, grab a cup, and help yourself to any of about a dozen flavors of frozen yogurt. Then you visit the toppings station and finish your masterpiece off, then bring it to the counter where it&apos;s weighed and priced. Easy peasy. I made a little mix of chocolate and dulce de leche yogurts and topped them with some crumbled toffee. If you&apos;re feeling virtuous, you can go for fresh fruit toppings. The dulce de leche was so delicious I was surprised that it was fat free. The toppings bar is impressive, and I was imagining different combos for future visits.

I&apos;ve been to about a dozen different froyo places, and I still use Cocomero as my gold standard. Nothing beats this place! The vast variety of flavors, the great taste, the decor, the price -- everything!

I&apos;m dying to head back to Chambana just so I can get a mere spoonful of my peach flavored froyo. You would not believe how difficult it is to find that flavor anywhere else, let alone some of their other ones, such as Kahlua and Bailey&apos;s Irish Cream. See what I mean by VAST variety of flavors? No one else comes close!

Good fricken&apos; grief, best frozen yogurt place ever. Chicago, you better watch yourself because Cocomero knows how to make frozen yogurt nonfat and tasty. I don&apos;t care for the probiotic stuff.

Unlike your other frozen yogurt places that only offer 4 or so flavors, Cocomero gives you at least 14 flavors to choose from. And no, you don&apos;t have to deal with places that don&apos;t know how to swirl your yogurt properly so there&apos;s a big gaping hole in the middle (where your money went), you serve yourself and you pay 50 cents per ounce. You also self-serve toppings like mango, cookie dough, mochi and cheesecake bites.

Today I loaded up on following flavors: red velvet, cookies and cream, and strawberry. I then added my favorite mix-ins: mango and cookie dough. I paid $5.40 for 20 minutes of okay, maybe I got too much, but damn this is good.

They also offer bubble tea, milk tea lattes, and shaved ice with fruit. I&apos;m assuming this is an Asian venture. I also like sticking around for the two-story ambiance if you can deal with Britney Spears&apos; latest album playing in the background.

Why does Urbana have better frozen yogurt than Chicago?!

I (and friend) kick myself for not putting more in my dish. More what? you ask...

MORE Red Velvet froyo
MORE Strawberry froyo
MORE Reese&apos;s Cup
MORE Brownies
MORE Mochi
MORE OF EVERYTHING

I wish we had this kind of froyo place in downtown Chicago. I have to go way out of my way (to Wicker Park) to get some self serve froyo and it sure isn&apos;t as good as this.

YES, so good. I go to school about 45-60 minutes away and I drove all the way to Champaign for this. OK well I went shopping too.

Cocomero is DIY frozen yogurt and I love that concept. There are a ton of different flavors. Pick one or mix and match. They will also give you taster cups, which are really hard to eat yogurt from. I don&apos;t get it. Once you have your yogurt, go to the topping bar and choose what you want. They have all kinds of fruit, nuts and candies. I recommend mochi :) Then, you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce ($.47/oz I believe). Sit down or take it to go. YUM.

Yum!  I LOVE how many flavors they offer and TONS of toppings!  The price isn&apos;t bad, mind you the only size bowls they have are HUGE so just don&apos;t think you have to fill up the bowl or you&apos;ll be shelling out $12 for froyo.  I generally pay $2-$4 for a little taste of 2-3 flavors and a couple of toppings.

Parking is on the street so bring change.

Possibly the only fro-yo joint in Champaign, but definitely the best! I like the Red Velvet cake fro-yo topped with cookie dough and whatever i feel for the night. This place is definitely a chill social spot and the environment is great! Right by campus (though, i do not attend UofI) and near everything else. The staff always greets with a smile coming in and going out. 5 stars most definitely!

This place is awesome!

I know everyone RAVES about Custard Cup, and don&apos;t get me wrong, I love that place too, but it&apos;s so nice and refreshing to have a healthier option thats open YEAR-ROUND!

I also love the style of this place, you walk in, grab an empty cup and fill it up with a combo of whatever flavors you want (or just one, but that&apos;s no fun) and top it off with anything from fresh fruits, cereals, candy, nuts, basically whatever you want. Champaign really needed a place like this!

Copacabana.   Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl.

Oh wait, it&apos;s Cocomero!

This place is kind of expensive for what you get, but well worth it.

I highly recommend trying the red velvet cake frozen yogurt.   I didn&apos;t even add toppings, and it was phenomenal!

Also, don&apos;t forget your quarters - There&apos;s no free street parking nearby.

I&apos;ve been to a similar concept store in Wheaton. This place seems pricey (some $0.47 per ounce), like that one, but the sheer amount of flavors and toppings is overwhelming compared to other stores like it.

I had a lactose-free mango frozen yogurt, and some pomegranate-based yogurt. Both were very good, and I had no complaints about them. There were many other flavors available, including the oddly-named &quot;European tang&quot;.

The toppings included yogurt chips, mochi (!!!), a brownie, very fresh fruit (yes, the mango was ripe) and more. The store design is very bright, very pastel and very smart.

I might just be back here tomorrow if I&apos;m craving more frozen yogurt. Hopefully I can try some of the more chocolately or crunchy toppings next time.

So I came down to U of I to visit for the first time, and I had heard so much about this place. Im a HUGE fan of FROYOOO :D. This place is pretty darn good. The red velvet is AMAZING. Green tea actually tastes like green tea, and they have pretty good pomegranate and other flavors. The fruit here is pretty fresh. It&apos;s a super and bright place. I was SO HAPPY to find out that they closed like at 12 on fri/sat. OMG if only the froyo places here in chicago did too :3. Anyways, the staff here is pretty nice and friendly although i think i may have jokingly scared off one of the cashiers haha my bad. I came here like three times in two days. I highly recommend it ^^

I just visited this super fun frozen yogurt shop today and I am totally in LOVE!  It is self-serve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to.  They have a bunch of flavors to pick from, so you can mix and match.  They also have loads of fresh fruit, chocolate, sprinkles and even mochi&amp;red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt.  After you pick out everything you want, they weigh it and charge you per ounce.  It is a really fun place to go, and it tasted great!

I had pineapple, mango and strawberry fro-yo topped with fresh pineapple, mango, coconut, mochi and kiwi.  A word to describe?  Scrumdiddlyumptious!

I am far too obsessed with this place. It has cute seating and the yogurt is delicious. I mostly veer towards the original/California tart and green tea. I top with blueberries (antioxidants!), mango, kiwi, mochi, and/or shredded coconut.

Beware of the large cups and the desire to fill the entire thing!! After the first time, I learned my lesson and now I usually leave with a $2-$3 cup of yogurt that satisfies completely!

Absolutely amazing frozen yogurt, soft serve style too.  This place is self serve and charges you by the weight of your selection, so feel free to mix and match as much as you want, and trust me, you will want to! There is a really big variety of yogurt flavors, and quite frankly, all of them are delicious.  Then there is a big topping bar with a ridiculously huge selection to choose from.  From fresh fruit to fruit loops.  There must be about 30-40 different toppings you can put on your yogurt and they all are fresh (the staff does great replacing the toppings frequently) and you are sure to find all you need to make your perfect concoction.

The only downside to this place is the price.  I&apos;m guessing most people are going to end up paying $5-6 for their yogurt dish, which I think is really high.  You pay by the ounce, but for only a cup of yogurt (8oz) you&apos;re going to pay at least $4.00  (I think its .49 cents an ounce)  I personally usually hit the $5-6 mark, and don&apos;t feel it&apos;s as much as I should be getting for that price, so that it my only complaint.  You can usually get a similar sized ice cream at other shops for $3 or so dollars instead of $5 or $6.

Despite the price though, this place is almost worth going to just for the atmosphere and exotic flavors of yogurt and eclectic toppings.  Stop by some time.

On my recent trip to California I made it a point to get to two froyo places - Pinkberry and Yogurtland.  Despite liking the tartness of PB&apos;s original flavor, it just couldn&apos;t match up to the variety of flavors, toppings, and the cheap pricing of YL.  Unfortunately, from what I had heard, the only other froyo place with the &quot;by-the-weight&quot; model in Chicago was pretty bad.

I&apos;ve known about the one in Champaign for a while but I&apos;d never gone...perhaps due to a fierce loyalty to Jarling&apos;s Custard Cup and the Moonstruck that Cocomero replaced.  But, as a lover of froyo I had to see what the fuss was about...

Fellow Yelpers, Yogurtland has come to the Midwest.  Tons of flavors, tons of toppings, cheap price, and super happy decor.  And most importantly - it&apos;s good.  ESPECIALLY the red velvet froyo.  My friends described my reaction as if I had just saw the love of my life.  In-freaking-tense.  I&apos;m happy I have a Custard Cup alternative to go to if I visit UIUC in the colder months.

I totally love the concept and the selection of flavors/toppings, but I wish that there was a good way of gauging how much you&apos;re going to need to pay before you head up to the register. Also, the frozen yogurt isn&apos;t quiiiite as creamy as what you&apos;ll find at other cool/trendy shops like Red Mango. Actually, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had any frozen yogurt that was up to the standards of Red Mango, so I guess that&apos;s a lot to ask for.

So an enthusiastic four stars for the selection and flexibility of toppings (finally there&apos;s a place that doesn&apos;t charge like $2 if you simply want a spoonful of raspberries along with a pinch of chocolate chips). Add some more creaminess and a scale at the toppings bar, and we&apos;re up to five.

&quot;We have 4 minutes until the next quarter starts...wanna run to Cocomero?&quot;

This place is fantastic. Honestly, it&apos;s a good thing it popped up right before I graduated, otherwise I probably would&apos;ve gone there several times a week for four years straight. My favorites were the espresso and peanut butter, and of course, all of the crazy toppings! During the NBA playoffs last year, Cocomero was how I relieved my stress during commercials and time-outs of those nail-biting games. We would run down the street to pick up fro-you and be back to catch the next quarter. I think one of the best parts is that they charge by weight, so you can just stop by for a taste if you are not in the mood (or shape, in my case) for an intensely heavy dessert. I heard that they recently started offering coffee drinks and such, and I&apos;m super bummed that I missed out! Anyone down for a trip down to &apos;paign?

&quot;It&apos;s healthy for ya!&quot;

Just remember, everything&apos;s relative =P

All but their peanut butter frozen yogurt is fat-free, and they even have a few dairy free selections.  Therefore... healthy!  Haha.  Well, when it&apos;s either frozen yogurt, or super rich and fattening Coldstone.... =P

Plus, I loooove the colorful, playful decor of Cocomero.  It just makes me happy!  They charge by the ounce, and you get the choice of a bunch of toppings like fresh strawberries, bananas, kiwi, peach, etc. cookie dough bits, cheesecake cubes, brownie chunks, just a lot of goodness that quickly turns a &quot;healthy&quot; dessert into a mounding heap of awesomeness.

Oh, and they&apos;re open late!  I came back from an evening at Iron Post, maybe around... 11 or so on a Friday night, and was shocked to see that Cocomero was still opening and packed!  True, it wasn&apos;t 2 in the morning when people are craving drunk food, but I had fully expected Cocomero to have been closed for the night.  My friend and I decided that it was sign... we had to stop by and get some (I had been craving sweets all night).

Be forewarned: this place is addicting!
