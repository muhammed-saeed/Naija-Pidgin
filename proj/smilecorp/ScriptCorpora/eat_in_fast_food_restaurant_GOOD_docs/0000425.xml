My favorite chick in the area. Great playground for the kids. Great staff. Great food.
I love the peach shakes and original chicken sandwich with waffle fries.

We had my daughter&apos;s 3rd B-day party at the Irvine Chick-Fil-A and it was so much fun and inexpensive. Everyone had a great time.

I like chick-fil-a and i often get a coupon delivered to my mailbox.. im not a big fan of burger and i dont normally order burger whenever i come here.. what i like from chick-fil-a is their oreo milkshake.. its so big and filling to the extent that shake itself is my meal, not a drink or dessert.. but i didnt get my shake this time, i got their breakfast oatmeal instead for about $3.87 including tax ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ). i didnt really like it, its so watery and not that good.. the portion itself is also small and for almost $4, i dont think its worth buying it again. service can be pretty nice or if you are unlucky, you&apos;ll get this rude lady serving you at the cashier..its quite incosistent so i cant say for sure..

Its such a pleasure to go through the drive thru at this location. You get the friendliest greeting and you can tell the person behind the big food sign is smiling as she takes your order. When you pull up to the window, you get the same consistent great service. This shows that you can be fast and friendly. Recently this location made a mistake with charging me for an order and fixed it right away in seconds. The food is hot and tastes great. Try coming here for a chicken biscuit for breakfast if you want a friendly smile and great service to kick start your day.

Stopped in yesterday for a bite. This location is clean, and the service is quick and polite. Ordered a Chick-Fil-A Deluxe meal with Honey Mustard and CFA sauce. Came out with no problems and no mistakes. Was given a free breakfast entree coupon with my drink, thought that was nice.

I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!! The food was fine but the Marketing Director was just rude. She took our trays and under her breath she told us to leave when we weren&apos;t there for may 15 minutes. Also telling us to watch our F bombs when none of us were using the F bomb. For my first time ever going I can say one thing. I WILL NEVER EAT AT ANOTHER CHICK-FIL-A EVER AGAIN!

A few years ago, if you had asked me what I thought about Chick-Fil-A&apos;s food, I would have told you I&apos;d rather eat cardboard instead.  Back then I thought the chicken sandwiches were bland, over-priced, and nothing to shout about.

Funny how my tastes have changed...guess I&apos;m getting old!.  The more time I spend eating here, the more I crave it.  My favorite is the spicy chicken sandwich.  Tender, juicy, meaty with a good amount of kick to it.  I like to further up a notch by adding buffalo sauce to it.  What&apos;s keeping me from coming back for more, more often?  The prices.  Hoooly crap does CFA know how to steal your $7.

But man, do they offer damn good food.  Not just the sandwiches, but their milkshakes and ice &quot;dreams&quot; are so damn good, creamy, and smooth.  My poor gut and wallet say no, but my taste buds say hell fuqing yes!  And their sweet tea is good too.  I don&apos;t even need to get started on the sauce offerings.

Add on top CFA&apos;s so-friendly-it&apos;s-creepy service from their so-friendly-it&apos;s-creepy staff (there&apos;s a reason for that), it all makes the CFA experience worthwhile.

And why you gotta close on Sundays?!  (There&apos;s a reason for that...)

**TIP***
Sign up for their text message offers and you&apos;ll receive the occasional free food deals which is usually the draw to get me into the store.  I&apos;m a cheap bastard so this makes it more worth it to stop in.

Not a huge fan of their food and after the last two visits to this location, I&apos;m definitely not a fan of their service. I did write a complaint to the location and they offered me free food... but really... do I want to show up to the location going, &quot;I&apos;m the person who didn&apos;t like your service so I&apos;m here for my free meal&quot;? So either they are fake nice, or god forbid they do something to my food! I personally can&apos;t imagine that ever happening, but from what I&apos;ve heard from people who have worked in restaurant industry... it happens.

The food is not terrible, however unless someone I was with was dying to eat here, I wouldn&apos;t go back.

-- Hey look it&apos;s the owner/proprietor on opening day!
(several weeks later)

-- Hey look it&apos;s the owner/proprietor working. Seriously working, not just &quot;supervising&quot;.

I met the guy because he greeted each and every guest who walked in on opening day. He was such a genuinely nice guy, and definitely hard working that I was thrown off because when do you see an owner of any fast food chain in the restaurant.... I&apos;ll answer that &quot;never&quot; because most are probably multi-unit owners who don&apos;t work directly in the business. It&apos;s because of this, I highly recommend you go out of your way to go to this location although the Irvine location off of Irvine blvd is good too, but not as good as this one because of hard working dude.

GREAT FOOD!  Made healthier than other food (not deep fried, and also have healthy options).  They are always VERY friendly!  We receive great coupons, and often, which is a plus.  I have 0 complaints about this place.  I would love to be able to go my own refil, but that&apos;s their style, and I don&apos;t complain about it becuase they always refil with a smile, they even come to your table to see if you want refils, so it isn&apos;t bothersome.  They never make you wait for it.

I&apos;ve only tried Chick-Fil-A once before about two years ago in a mall food court somewhere in north NJ.  I didn&apos;t think much of it at the time.  Sure, it was fine. A decent chicken sandwich, nice waffle fries, nothing special.  Nothing to get excited about.

So I sort of forgot about Chick-Fil-A even though they seem to be popping up all over the place lately.  It just didn&apos;t entice me.  Lately though I&apos;ve been thinking about giving them another chance.  What if the loud, crowded Jersey food court polluted my experience?  What if they really were as good as everyone keeps saying?  They deserve another chance.  However, my husband was never too keen whenever I&apos;d suggest it.  If we&apos;re having a pig out drive thru session it&apos;s usually because one or both of us is craving grease.  But tonight I ate solo and decided it was finally time to try them again.

I got a #2 chicken club combo.  The sandwich looks fairly plain but it&apos;s actually very tasty.  The chicken is thick and moist and has a lot of flavor.  I like that you get a big leafy piece of lettuce, not watery iceberg.  The waffle fries are also great.  I like that this meal filled me up but didn&apos;t give me that disgustingly full just-ate-a-burger feeling.

Turned out it was some sort of promotional day or something because for the month of Dec if you take you receipt back next time you get the entire meal free!

On the secret menu, there are FRIED PICKLES.  Simply ask for it and they will gladly make it for you.  So awesome.

Crispy battered, tangy and a nice bite.

I love chick fil a and now it&apos;s closer to my home.  I could eat here everyday, but that would be a lie b/c I have eaten at chick fil a everyday before.  I don&apos;t get tired of the food.  They have breakfast to dinner covered, so I just have to choose a delicious meal.  I normally go with a CFA chicken sandwich with extra pickles, medium size waffle fries, and a sweet tea.

If you feel like gaining some weight you can also get a fantastic shake as well.  I really love the cookies and cream.  You gain weight just thinking about that one.  Don&apos;t forget they are closed on Sundays.   There were a few times I drove to a CFA and ended up depressed.

Best fast food joint. Hands down.

I like to come to Chik-Fil-A so I can dine like a goddamn king. Not only do they have the tastiest chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had... not only do they have such a plethora of dipping sauces that each and every bite of my clucking delight has a new and distinct flavor... not only are their waffle fries (relatively) healthy and they taste awesome...

But the service here is unreal. Honestly, from the moment you step inside the place the staff treats you like a Head of State, or something comparable. I can&apos;t remember the last time I was called &quot;sir&quot; so many times in a 3 minute period. Everyone working here is extremely friendly and they do whatever you ask. Well, anything within reason, of course. Hell, they even come by your table to askif you&apos;d like to &quot;have your beverage refreshed&quot;. Refreshed! Not a refill, a &quot;refreshment&quot;. Goddamn. Here I am, putting up with fast food workers that have accents so thick they could be considered morbidly obese, and staff who toss my food at me on a tray like they&apos;re hoping to fry my crotch with hot edibles... and all this time the staff at Chik-Fil-A have existed as these pleasant people. I seriously get better service here than most restaurants where I pay 3x the price.

If I have one gripe, it&apos;s the they aren&apos;t open on Sundays. I get that the founder is hardcore gay for Jesus and all, but I think people deserve to eat this most tasty fowl food 7 days a week. He claims it&apos;s because God had a day of rest, but you know what? I&apos;ll bet on his day off God would want to eat a fucking charbroiled chicken sandwich from Chik-Fil-A. Ever consider that, you bastard? But I digress... this place rules.

After mingling with what seemed like every unemployed person in SoCal at a networking mixer at Saddleback Church, it was getting late and I needed some grub.

I happened to remember Chick-Fil-A opening up down the street so I hightailed it over.  Also remembering in the process that my free sandwich coupon was at home.  Screw me.

This location used to previously occupy a Wendy&apos;s but I was kind of surprised when I first moved here that there was an In-n-Out but no Chick-Fil-A.  Those two places always open shop together.  Oh well but that was quickly remedied by the economy now wasn&apos;t it?

I&apos;m not a frequent customer so I took my sweet time at the drive thru menu and probably bored the cashier with my endless questions.  Does the combo come with this and that?  Do you serve this? What kind of sauces do you have?  Wait, can you repeat that again? What&apos;s a Polynesian sauce?  What&apos;s in that sauce?

Eventually after 15 minutes I let her take my order.  I must admit she gets 5 stars for being so patient.  I wish I had gotten her name but for now she&apos;s just the late shift girl and I asked for every single sauce to go with my #6 spicy chicken ranch wrap combo with the waffle cut fries.  Yes, I know all those sauces are bad for you and probably not a good thing if I want to lose weight but don&apos;t you think I thought of that when I decided to drive down here and be lazy about cooking?

Anyway, my food was great.  It usually doesn&apos;t vary from one Chick-Fil-A to another unless someone really just doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing and all the sauce combinations were just fabulous.  I still don&apos;t know which one I liked best.  I guess I&apos;ll just have to try them all again and I&apos;ll have to remember my free sandwich coupon.

If you&apos;ve never had Chick-Fil-A, it is the In-N-Out of fried chicken sandwiches. I can&apos;t exactly put my finger on what is so good, but it is really good.

This one in particular is the fanciest fast food restaurant I&apos;ve ever eaten at. They have fresh flowers on every table, the interior is decorated with soothing earth tones and wood, and the staff is friendly. They actually come around and ask if you&apos;d like a refill on your drink. My favorite is the condiment bar - they have lots of different sauces and the area is always clean and tidy.

I seriously can&apos;t believe I&apos;m giving a place with a drive-through five stars, but these guys deserve it.

My favorite chicken sandwich is still the Chick-fil-a Original Sandwich.   (McDonalds and KFC would call them crispy, a non-marketing person would call them Southern fried or deep fried).  The seasoned crust holds together all the juices inside the chicken breast.  Brownies ala mode highlight their unmatched vanilla soft serve ice cream.  Less well known is the cheesecake, which is probably the richest, smoothest slice you can find anywhere.  Breakfast is also good, but pricey.  There is no animal style here, but the menu has far more healthier choices than In-N-Out: salads, wraps, and grilled chicken sandwiches.

Georgia&apos;s Chick fil A draws a lot of comparisons to California&apos;s In-N-Out.  They are both Christian owned businesses (Chick Fil-A even closes on Sundays), managed by internally promoted employees (not rich franchisees who buy in),  paying their employees well, delivering courteous service, and making above average food for slightly above average prices.  In-N-Out is built on beef, and Chick-Fil-A is almost entirely chicken based.  Both are carried on a highly devoted fan base.

Not everyone loves Chick-Fil-A.  The &quot;crispy&quot; sandwiches occasionally get soggy in their foil wrappers, and the grilled sandwiches are honestly better at other places.  The wraps and chicken salad sandwich are prepared way in advance, and as such, they are usually dry.  If you want a chicken salad sandwich, Arby&apos;s across the street has a great one for about the same price.

I go to KFC for fried chicken, and I go to Chick-Fil-A for fried sandwiches and waffle fries.  You can slightly off-set that Southern fried grease with sugarless beverages you can&apos;t easily find elsewhere: Diet Dr Pepper, Coke Zero, or their in-house Diet Lemonade.  (for sour lovers only)  Like In-N-Out, it&apos;s very popular, and the lines can get long.  Parents, this location has an enclosed playground.

Where Chick-Fil-A always shines brightest is customer service.  The operator of the store, himself a former associate from the South, spends every lunch picking up tables, talking with customers and working behind the counter.  Every staff member is equally gracious and courteous.  &quot;My Pleasure&quot; is the corporate catchphrase, and it always reminds you of that good food and Southern hospitality works in California just as well as it does in Georgia.

This is one fast-food restaurant I will go out of my way to eat at (In-N-Out is the only other one). The chicken sandwiches are delicious, and if you&apos;re going to break down and ingest some High-Fructose Corn Syrup, this is the place to do it (it&apos;s in just about all their sauces). The only time I&apos;ve been in this restaurant that it wasn&apos;t packed was for breakfast. Everything&apos;s fresh, they keep the place very clean, and the employees are very helpful and friendly.

Can&apos;t say enough about this place!
The owner comes to your table, introduces himself in a non-cheesy, humble way, &quot;be sure to say hi next time you&apos;re in&quot;... dude! I&apos;m totally IN with the owner! Tee hee hee.
The workers are amazingly helpful, polite and genuine, the play area is CLEEEEEEAAAANNNNN!!! (Biggie for us momms!) The kid&apos;s meals come with a book, not some goofy toy that will be lost in a week. The food is to die for, the lemonade tart and fab. Did I mention the play area is CLEAN?!?! :o )

I cant describe how much this place takes the cake of all other fast food places. It has an abundance of healthy choices and they have numerous sauces to choose from without limitation. I can have as many different types of dipping sauces as my little heart desires. And talk about customer service, the employees even come by as you are eating and ask if you want a refill on your drink. Best fast food bar none. Great food, great service, great for you!

Chick-Fil-A has the best chicken sandwich hands down.  Good quality chicken, simple, tasty.  You need to actually go into the location so you can see all the condiments available to put on your sandwich like Texas Pete hot sauce, Chick-Fil-A sauce, honey mustard, etc.  The people that work here are polite and helpful and happy.  It is a totally different fast food experience.  Love their lemonade and sweet tea that you can buy by the gallon to take home.  I have used their catering for work and have been very pleased with that also.  They treat customers so incredibly well here and have a great customer rewards program through their email with Chick-Fil-A and the cowz program.  We were recently invited to their first customer appreciation night at UCI and got to meet other Chick-Fil-A fans and people who work with the company.  It was an incredible night of food and fun.

It&apos;s about time there was a Chick-Fil-A close to my house (sort of.) Seriously the best way to describe CFA is that it&apos;s pretty much In-N-Out but with fried chicken although they have a ton of items on the menu, none of which actually matter aside from the chicken and are the culinary equivalent of the nerdy kid who gets picked last for kickball and only because the teacher made you include him.

Grilled or fried this is seriously the only place that has a worthwhile fast-food chicken sandwich. Top that mother off with one of the 359 sauces they have and a bona fide sweet tea and you&apos;re in crispy, delicious, artery-clogging heaven.

The only downside is that they&apos;re closed on Sundays due to little baby Jesus. WWJD? I&apos;ll tell you what he&apos;d do, make sure ChickFilA is open 24/7 so I wouldn&apos;t have to endure Denny&apos;s or Albertacos at 3 AM after drinking enough Jameson to make me honorarily Irish.

For Fans Of: Hangovers, white-people safe southern food, purchasing tea by the gallon and things there should be more of.

I came here with my friend after the west seal sale in the morning.  The food was prepared quick!  When I said that to my friend, she said it was fast because the food size was sooo small!  So true!  The food tasted good though.  We ordered the chicken nuggets and the chicken minis, which came in 3 small parts.  The latter was not that great.  We also ordered a fruit parfait, which tasted delicious.  Overall, the staff were friendly, patient because we were indecisive with ordering, and well-mannered because they have to be!

The chick-fil-a in Foothill is my favorite chick-fil-a. I will drive out of my way to hit this one. The service is great the Manager(owner?) is setting the standard for his staff well above what you would normally see at a &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant. The staff is always attentive and almost overly friendly. When ever we stop in(and it is frequent) someone asks us how we are, how is my husband or where is your friend today?

The food is always great, but its chick-fil-a. You can get it at any one of their restaurant&apos;s. We defiantly come back for the people here.

Any reason a chicken fast food chain shows up on yelp under &quot;churches&quot;? I know it isn&apos;t because people worship their food

I had never tried Chick-Fil-A (deprived I know), but after trying their signature sandwich, I found a new favorite. Before the place opened, they went around to all the businesses and handed out coupons for a free sandwich. I thought that was a nifty marketing strategy, so I went for it. Also, normally when you encounter younger people working at fast food restaurants they are rude. Not the case. Go Chick-Fil-A!!!

First tried Chick-fil-A in Florida and now stoked it&apos;s close by in Foothill Ranch! The place is really clean, super friendly and has very tasty, fresh food!

I get the spicy chicken sandwhich with pepper jack cheese. I put Chick-fil-A and Texas Pete sauces on it. mmmmmmmmmmm

I have yet to get something on the menu I don&apos;t like and I&apos;ve had almost everything.

Insider Tip: follow them on Twitter because they&apos;ll post a lot of freebie specials for you... ChickfilaFhRnch

This was my first time eating at a Chick-Fil-A.  I didn&apos;t even check Yelp reviews before coming to this place, but I&apos;m not surprised that it has 4.5 stars.  I got the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich.  Only 3.5g of fat.   Pretty healthy and delicious!  You know how Carl&apos;s Jr sandwiches look great on TV but when you get them, they&apos;re a mess (flattened and sloppily put together).  Not at this place!  I went through the drive-thru and the employee was pretty pleasant as well.  Before handing me my order she actually looked into the bag to make sure everything was okay (it wasn&apos;t, wrong salad dressing and she caught that) before handing it to me.  Awesome.  Wish there was one closer to home.

Superstar service. Some of the best customer service out there.

Normally I wouldn&apos;t write about a multi-state chain or a basic fast food place but the service alone is worth writing about.  This is definitely a family place and a place that has company values.  It completely shows. Definitely a refreshing to be in an establishment where the company values seem to be displayed genuinely and from bottom to top.

Everytime I have been in here, everyone is super-friendly, courteous, patient, and helpful.  The one time the bf and I did not take our food to-go we happened to sit next to a table of elementary school-age girls who were sitting at a table different from their parents (it appeared that their parents were at the next table).  An employee was going around checking on everyone making sure everyone was okay, making sure everyone&apos;s enjoying themselves.  Now this lady assumed that the girls next to us were &quot;our girls&quot; and asked us if they needed anything and if we&apos;d like her to get them more napkins, drinks, dipping sauces, etc. Whoa!!!  We politely said &quot;no&quot; to the offer since those weren&apos;t our kids but wow, if they were, that is SUPER DUPER helpful!!! I can only imagine what it is like to have children but I can tell that if I did, an offer of help like that at any dining establishment must be such a huge lifesaver. Anyways, any place that is willing to offer that kind of assistance without be asked to in the first place is definitely in a league of its own in customer service.

The food is also really good. As many others have remarked, CFA is to chicken what In-N-Out is to beef.  The quality and taste are elevated. I have quickly become a big fan of the nuggets, spicy crispy chicken sandwich and the lemon meringue pie.

Visit CFA if you&apos;re in the mood for a basic chicken sandwich and don&apos;t want to go to a scary and impersonal place like KFC.

One last tip, the company is fairly religious so CFA is closed on Sundays so keep that in mind if its Sunday and you&apos;re looking for some chicken!

I love Chick Fil A and this place is no exception. We were hanging out with a friend and she all of a sudden said chick fil a and I was YES we gotsa go there for lunch. The thing I wasn&apos;t prepared for was the 5 mile round trip we would have to endure walking there. As always the chicken was tasty and of cource the different dips you can have it with and how else can you eat it without the Lemondade. I love the lemonade.
