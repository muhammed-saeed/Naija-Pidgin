***Green Burrito Only*** (skip to the last paragraph for actual review)

Yesterday was terrible.  I had worked a full work week at my &quot;real&quot; job, ending with a 9-1:30 shift on Saturday, only to have a mere 2 hour break during which to catch some Padres excitement before returning to work at my backbreaking second job until midnight.  Yesterday, I started again with the catering at 7:30 am, an hour I don&apos;t even see during the regular work week, let alone on Sunday, my solo day off.

It was an outside, Jewish, 80 year old birthday brunch and the job was terrible.  It rained, we were forced to carry chairs up and down stairs, and we ran out of certain foods.  So, our fearless leader decided that it wouldn&apos;t be appropriate for us worker bees to even nibble on the leftovers.  Finally, I&apos;m off work at 4pm, having eaten one crouton, one bite of a bagel, and sipped on some OJ to keep my sugar up while working under such demanding conditions for over 8 hours.

Oh, did I mention that I just got swindled into another 2 hour shift that evening, again with a mere 2 hour break in an effort to restore my sanity, take a shower, and do some laundry?

I am in need of some fast eats in little time and knowing I will be right back to work in no time at all, I&apos;m hoping for something a little lighter than typical fast food fare.  My ride home takes me from Lincoln to Adams on 30th which doesn&apos;t leave many options and I pull into the only drive-thru option available.

Hoping for a salad of some sort and without my glasses to aid me in deciphering the menu, I pick the first thing I can read, &quot;Taco Salad.&quot;

Pure and utter dissatisfaction!  Mind you, I am STARVING and felt like I could literally eat cat food if necessary, this was still a raging disappointment.  Wilted, brown, nasty lettuce, subpar taco meat, and a soggy shell.  In the mood I was yesterday, this would have only warranted 1 star, but I realize I wasn&apos;t thinking clearly, so I decided to upgrade them to 2...

Typical drive through in San Diego. Half the time they don&apos;t speak good english the other half they screw up your order. What&apos;s the point of having the screen if you&apos;re gonna say &quot;I got your total at the window&quot;? They are slow even when there isn&apos;t anybody there. But they keep sending me coupons, so my cheap ass keeps coming back.

Carl, your establishment is the only one to have constantly given me crying pee-pee butt through out my life as a human being.

Starting from the meek and tender age of 9; I can still remember it now...I was just going into 4th grade and had just moved to Sacramento to live with my grandmother, it struck. The parents had ordered me a burger with onion rings on it and I had eaten it, innocently enough...naive as to what was to come and not stop till later that evening. My poor little kid butt wept.

Flash forward to present day and many failed visits later, including to this very location: I still cant eat their burgers without having to plan out the rest of my day in the bathroom, book in-hand and social calendar cleared for the incoming outgoing. I can have their appetizers just fine, just no burgers.

No burgers.

No burgers.

No burgers.

Don&apos;t even get me start on Carl&apos;s Jr&apos;s laxative Latina cousin, Green Burrito. That ho has me running for the juan twice as fast as Carlito does.

For the most part I&apos;ve given up my drinking career for a more beneficial one that involves good behavior and self-awareness.

This past Saturday night I found myself reliving the old habits with a few two many with the girls.

Sunday morning rolls viciously around my pounding head and sand-filled mouth and I need giant vats of liquid and some sort of greasy, artery clogging relief.

I drive my aching being to Carl&apos;s for a breakfast sandwich. I liked the looks of the Sourdough breakfast sammie but I don&apos;t eat any of those meats so I requested it meatless.
The drive-thru clerk was awesome, encouraged me to order any of their breakfast delights without, no prob.

I ended up getting an entire combo which was surprisingly cheap, just under $4.

My sandwich was exactly what the hangover doctor ordered, scrambled eggs with two kinds of cheese, melting and layered between crunchy, greasy sourdough bread.

I felt each unhealthy, delicious bite combating the deep blue funk that had settled into my soul.

Coupled with crunchy hash browns nuggets and an ice cold soda and I was saved, and ready to brave the day, albeit with dark sunglasses and an icepack on my head.

Summary Report Of  Dining  At Fast Food Place, i.e Carl&apos;s Jr.

Name: Nick T.
Review #: 1036
Age : N/A
Race: Asian, possibly a mutt, definitely with too much time to waste.
Sex: From the looks of him, its probably been awhile.
Case Name : Romulus
First officer on the scene : Remus
Date of Dinner: 12/2/2009
Location : North Park, 30th and El Cajon Blvd.
Food Identified by: Store employees
Investigative Agency: YELP.COM

The meal  began at 8:30 P.M. on Dec 2, 2009. The food is presented on a black plastic tray. The diner is wearing casual attire. Jeans, black loafers, loose shirt. No jewelry except for a cheap watch, possibly Asian or Italian knock-off. The employees are dressed accordingly. Establishment appears clean and presentable.

Subsequent inspection of $6 mushroom burger is that of a normally prepared burger measuring approximately 5-6 inches across, 1/2 in thickness and weighing 1/3 to 1/2 pounds, consistent with most other items on the $6 burger menu. The patty is warm, dry and thick. TOD ( time of death ) of cow is estimated at 2-3 years prior to being processed. After a Y incision, patty was determined to be well done, almost charred and is to be expected of establishment.

The tomatoes were red and juicy, consistent with ripened fruits of the same variety and species. Burger contained exactly two slices. Temperature tested at 53 degrees farenheit. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, indicative of a freshly sliced head. Mushrooms exhibited signs of a struggle as they were being massed produced but were arranged evenly and overflowing off the sides. Total weight approximately 3-4 ounces.

Buns measured 5-6 inches across and lined up with meat patty and weighed no more than 2-3 ounces total. Upon further inspection, slight contusion marks can be seen, possibly from too firm of a grip by employees, and buns were determined to not have been grilled or buttered.

Fries were cut abstractly, with jagged edges, indicating a left to right slashing pattern, also indicative of an angry pimply faced teenager with no knife skills or a dull commercial slicer. Slightly overcooked but portioned correctly, judging by the fullness of containment unit, also know as carrier or holder.

Diet coke is Diet Coke. Weight is approximately 16 ounces. Cup and ice weighed 13 ounces, actual soda weighed 3 ounces.. No further comment on the matter. Not sure why the word diet is capitalized.

Result :

For a $6 burger from a franchised corporate conglomerate, it would appear to be fundamentally sound but is however lacking in the taste and satisfaction area of the left side of the vic&apos;s (aka Nick T) cerebellum,  thereby preventing any possible recurrences of any future visits, notwithstanding  closure of other nearby hamburger locations with In N Out on the building or Hodads.

Case remains open.

I&apos;m not one to spend much time in fast food places. But I have noticed a plethora of places offering &quot;$1 Menus&quot; and can&apos;t help but look into what these are about. They have these at McDonald&apos;s and Jack in the Box, and might in the other fast food giants as well.

Usually and predictably, these menu items are about what you would expect for a dollar: a paper-thin patty on a tiny, tasteless bun. And so, given that as a standard, I thought the Carl&apos;s Jr. $1 Spicy Chicken sandwich deserved special mention, both for size and taste. No, it won&apos;t knock your socks off in an absolute sense. It&apos;s still a $1 menu item and one would probably have to do some pretty fancy investigative work to find evidence of actual chicken in this thing. But still, compared to other $1 items, it&apos;s tasty, moist, filling and good.

Definitely worth a try someday. I&apos;m not a huge fan of fast food. But if you were going to have it and had a special hankering for a $1 chicken sandwich, you probably couldn&apos;t do better.

AMMENDMENT I (12-19-07).

After sampling a few more of these $1 menu items around town, I&apos;ve revised my review from 4-stars to 5. This one really is exceptional. And so long as we&apos;re clear that this is based on a scale of other COMPABLE (ie, $1 fast food) items, it deserves a perfect score.

Still the friendliest drive-thru EVER.

They changed something up with the fries - they were good before, but they are GREAT now!

Word of caution when going around the drive thru to the window - it&apos;s a pretty sharp and narrow turn.  The person in front of us bumped into the curb, and then we went and did the same thing. Oops.

Let&apos;s face it: Carl&apos;s Jr has great food. But the North Park location is nothing short of a catastrophe. Why? CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I went in the other day, and stood AT THE COUNTER, with no other customers in the LOBBY, for a good five minutes before someone even acknowledged my presence. Hey, I don&apos;t mind waiting; I know things get busy (even though &quot;busy&quot; would not describe the state of the restaurant when i walked in). But basic human courtesy  (in relation to customer service, of course) dictates that you at least GREET the person you are forcing to wait for your service--you don&apos;t even have to ask ME to wait. A simple &quot;hello&quot; might do. Just something, in other words, to let me know that you give a damn.

Nothing of the sort was done here. The girls working the counter kept scampering back and forth, averting their eyes, acting as if I didn&apos;t exist. After a few minutes rolled by, I was having trouble tolerating this. When one of the cashiers FINALLY decided to do her job and get around to helping me, no eye contact was made, and I was asked &quot;what can I get you&quot; in thinly-veiled annoyance (I must point out I was perfectly patient up until this moment).

&quot;Hi,&quot; I said, trying to restart the conversation on a better foot, to know that I was, in fact, dealing with a fellow human being.

&quot;What can I get you?&quot; she repeated.

At that point I sarcastically asked how she was doing, told her &quot;never mind&quot; and walked out. Maybe the way I handled the situation makes me sound like a pinched old grandmother, but is it too much to ask of a place you are patronizing a semblance of courtesy, and maybe even RESPECT? It&apos;s true that there are no manners in this hollow, frivolous society of ours anyway, but you&apos;d think someone could manage basic social skills for the sake of their job. On the other hand, maybe I&apos;m just old-fashioned.

I love this location. Perhaps it is all the eye candy on the street you get to experience while pulling out of the place? Or is the pimps cruising along the back alleys and the Starbucks?

The service is fast, friendly and very cool. I must come here weekly and get the same respect every single time. I doubt I every gotten a wrong order.

One time under remolding phase they forgot to return my debit card. It was locked away but I didn&apos;t ask for free meals because it was my mistake. The manager put a note for 2 free meals on my ATM card but I took the blame on this one!

Or how about dinning here and seeing a hooker with daisy dukes hide out calling her pimp saying the cops are outside! That was pretty cool because they got her when she booked it around the back exit.

Western Bacon Cheeseburgers. Hmmmm, my favorite. Now I have to move up a notch on my belt!

The fat: A perfect place to dine and experience the subculture of prostitution right before your eyes!

The skinny: Open 24 hours and they have now Green Burrito!

I love the six dollar mushroom burger. So much better than McDonald&apos;s Angus mushroom burger (theirs is kinda dry). Need some water to wash it down, eh? I also tried the turkey burger. Very moist and tender and juicy. I thought it was very good. Also have tried the Green Burrito items like the Green Chicken burrito. It&apos;s a large burrito with white meat chicken in a flour tortilla and smothered in green chile sauce and cheese. Yummy! Plus the tortilla chips to dip in the sauce. Oh yeah.

Dude!  Chick!   or whatever you are.  OMG, Carl&apos;s Jr has just sold me a burger 2 weeks before I even stepped into their restaurant.  Lately, I&apos;ve been super annoyed by their radio commercial for the &quot;teriyaki burger&quot;.  I find myself walking around my office or driving around in my car talking out loud; saying &quot;HALA KAHIKI... on a great big juicy a-o pipi eewilly e-a&quot;.  I&apos;m serious, if you&apos;ve heard it... you are probably in the same boat as me.
Oh yeah, back to my review.  Anyways, I finally tried one.  Got me the double because I am a beef eater.  (hmm, that didn&apos;t sound too good)  Well, I felt a little let down.  Yeah, yeah I shouldn&apos;t have expected so much from a fast-food restaurant but I have to give this burger a slightly better than average score.  Basically, its just their basic burger using a generic teriyaki sauce to replace the ketchup and top with two slices of canned pineapple slices.  Like I said earlier... it was okay I guess.  No, I wouldn&apos;t buy another one but I just had to try one because of that &quot;kraaaaayzie&quot; radio commercial.

Do not go to this Carls Jr. at 10 p.m. on a Thursday night. To the order taker, first clean the poop from between your ears, before you go to work at night. When someone says onion rings five times, there should be onion rings in my bag. Two do not serve up Dr. Pepper that is all soda water retard. Thanks for the soggy fries, when they should be some what crisp you lazy bastards. Not like there was not enough bizzness going on, for there to be fresh food served up. The drive through was 8 cars deep. Order number 206679 was a pile of vomit. Thanks jack offs, I will never go to this location ever again. Thank you for making Mac D&apos;s seem like a five star dinning experience. You suck for that, hope Mr. Karl digs his way out of his grave, and comes and burns this location down. F U!

Every time we have come to this Carls Jr I&apos;ve had some of the worst food that has given us the runs. No joke! The staff is nice, plentiful parking, good deals, but terrible food. I&apos;ve never had worser food at any other Carl&apos;s Jr than at this location. Either they have the worst health code standards, or they don&apos;t refrigerate the ingredients right, either way each different order has resulted the same way with two different people. I highly recommend avoiding this location unless you plan to get food poisening and plan on an ER trip the next day. They should have Pepto included in for free with their combos.

This review is for the GREEN BURRITO part of the Carl&apos;s Jr. menu.  I got hooked on the  99 cent tacos at another San Diego Green Burrito location, but they were always getting my order wrong, so I came to this location.  Service is EXCELLENT (drive thru) and I can actually understand what they are saying through the intercom.  Service is quick and with a smile, and most importantly, the food is great !  The green chicken burrito has real pieces of white breast chopped up and the green steak burrito has quality chunks of steak.  These burritos are huge.  I&apos;m addicted to those beef tacos, soft or hard shell, they are great.  I am a fussy customer and try to stay away from chain restaurants, but this is currently my favorite Mexican food.  I am tired of getting chunks of fatty mystery meat covered in oil from so many of the local mom and pop taco stands.  The cheese and lettuce is always fresh looking at Green Burrito.  Who says you can&apos;t eat affordably and be satisfied at the same time ? Thank You, Green Burrito at 30th and El Cajon !!! I&apos;ll be back soon.
