CAREER MANAGEMENT / CANDIDATE

 

 EHS Hospitality Group is a National/International recruiting firm specializing in the career management /recruitment of hospitality professionals for the past two decades.



It is our responsibility to discover the best management candidates for positions available with 300+ National/International companies in quick service, casual, family and fine dining segments. EHS also works with a wide variety of hotels and resorts. EHS assists hundreds of candidates a year with their career growth by referring them for positions from Assistant Manager to Director of Operations. Recently we placed a director of operations for Chili’s/On the Border for Dubai in the UAE but also placed a GM at Firehouse Subs in Sarasota, Fl. So whatever your level we can assist you with your career.

 EHS Is Different From Other Recruiting Companies 

 

 We meet 90% of our candidate and do full one to two hour interviews. It’s the only way to make a great fit for you! 
All of our recruiters have a strong hospitality management background. We know better than to take a Sous Chef and try to place him in quick service. We will not waste your time. We have been where you are.

 

 EHS is a free, confidential, networking service for candidates like yourself. Our service allows managers to search for a position while still remaining employed. For those unemployed it allows you to quickly find the best opportunities and be moved through the interview process quickly because of our long standing client contacts.

 

We call ourselves Career Managers because even though the companies pay our fees our main concern is finding the “right fit” for the candidate. We take time to discover and evaluate the candidate’s skills, define their goals, ambitions and desires: we then guide you through every step of the interview process by providing the necessary information on each company/interviewer. Our companies/candidates appreciate us because we meet 90% of our candidates and interview them. We do not do 5 minute phone calls and then blast your resume across the internet. We also will not work with every company that will pay us. We only work with companies that take care of their managers and live up to their promises.

 

The majority of our management positions are not advertised and vary from day to day as we fill and take job orders from Clients. Our having your resume allows us to evaluate your abilities and begin networking for you immediately if you desire, let us assist you in locating the great career change you have been thinking about! So please search our jobs and apply on line for great career opportunities.  Contact Us .


 

And even though you may not be looking for a new job now, we are hear to assist you and answer your questions. We can also assist you in putting together your resume. So that when that time comes that you would like to advance your career and have a better quality of life you will feel comfortable knowing we are here for you.
