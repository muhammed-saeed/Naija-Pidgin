Vladimir Mironov&apos;s Lab-Grown Meat: Would You Eat It?

 usda.gov Is livestock soon to be obsolete? 
 The cows that make up our burgers consume 80 percent of the planet&apos;s farmland, generate 20 percent of our greenhouse emissions, and consume 10 percent of our fresh water. Also, cows don&apos;t like getting killed.

Feel bad? You could go vegetarian, but that takes sacrifice. Luckily, modern science has a way around almost every dilemma. At universities in the U.S. and Europe, researchers are busy cultivating meat in petri dishes.

Dr. Vladimir Mironov, whose name seems well-suited to a Frankenfood scientist, is an associate professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. He&apos;s been working toward developing lab-grown meat from stem cells bathed in a nutrient-rich bioreactor mixture for the past decade, according to ABC News . He and Nicholas Genovese, a research associate backed by funding from PETA, are working on customizing the taste, texture and nutrient content of &quot;in-vitro meat.&quot; The going is slowed by lack of funding and high costs (right now, a single lab-hatched burger would cost tens of thousands of dollars to create), but their goal is to get their meat from the agar jelly to your plate as soon as possible.

Short Order asked two locals --- one who loves cows, and one who loves to cook cows --- what they thought about the initiative.
 
 
 Alex Cuevas, Miami vegan and animal advocate 
 &quot;I don&apos;t think that ethically there&apos;s anything wrong with getting 
lab-engineered meat, so I&apos;m ethically neutral, maybe slightly positive 
on that,&quot; said Alex Cuevas ,
 local animal rights activist and soon-to-be vegan restaurateur. &quot;As 
in, if someone really needs to have meat, it&apos;s better that they eat that
 than to kill an animal and to cause suffering and environmental damage.
 So I&apos;m more on the positive side on that front. However, I&apos;m 
nutritionally opposed to it. The foundation of the nutritional reasons 
for being vegetarian is predicated on that meat has little nutritional 
value and a lot of negativity related to animal protein, toxicity in the
 meat, fat, and cholesterol. So I&apos;d rather people go vegetarian, but if 
they&apos;re going to eat anything that&apos;s going to be meat-based, ethically I
 think that&apos;s a better choice.&quot;

On the other side of the cow pasture is Peter Vauthy , chef at Red the Steakhouse ,
 where Michael Jordan and other star athletes feast on Certified Angus 
Beef Prime, the &quot;top 1 percent of all U.S.D.A.-graded cattle.&quot; 
Surprisingly, he was similarly open to the entrance of in-vitro meat on 
the food scene.

&quot;It&apos;s always a shock when new 
ideas and concepts come along. But as a restaurateur, if no one can tell
 the difference between that and a regular steak and it&apos;s 
cost-effective, there&apos;s no reason not to use it,&quot; he said.

 
 Chef Peter Vauthy of Red the Steakhouse 
 Still, he wasn&apos;t sure consumers would be on board. &quot;God bless PETA and 
their morality, but at the end of the day, people don&apos;t want food that&apos;s
 been genetically engineered. That&apos;s why heirloom tomatoes are in 
demand. People want things that are grown locally and that are 
sustainable products, which this might be, but I would bet that it&apos;s 
about ten years from being something you might find in a restaurant. 
I&apos;ve gotten my beef from the same place for years, and I know that the 
cows are not being treated poorly. But if they can pull this off and 
make it taste the same, it would be something to consider.&quot;

And
 there you have it. Who would have dreamed all it would take to bring an
 animal rights activist and a steakhouse chef to consensus are some cow 
stem cells and a petri dish?

Where did the 80% of the plant&apos;s farmland number come from? Even for all meat, not just beef, that&apos;s a pretty extreme number. Throwing it out unsupported is not a good way to get taken seriously.
 
Would I eat it once? Sure; I&apos;m an infant, everything goes in my mouth. The test would be whether I want to eat it again. 

I&apos;m not at all sold on the ethical case against meat--in fact, I&apos;m wholly skeptical as to whether the phrase&quot;ethical case against meat&quot;is language at all--but if it&apos;s yummy, and we can move food resources toward starving people away from meat animals, then I&apos;m all for it.
 
I stick to organic meats and veggies myself, I would have to say that petri dish meat scares me on several different levels But as our population grows it will probably be the future of meat, harmless or not  :(
 
But what do you think about meat from a petri dish?
 
There has NEVER been a human culture since the beginning of time that survived on a meatless diet, since the beginning of human existence 45-85% of the diet came from animals from insects to Shellfish. Stick to grass-fed beef, vegetable fed chicken, and eat copious amounts of bacon (without the nitrates if possible) A small piece of liver contains as much nutrients as a whole bushel of veggies BTW. And if god didn&apos;t want us to eat animal than why on earth did he make them out of MEAT!!!!
