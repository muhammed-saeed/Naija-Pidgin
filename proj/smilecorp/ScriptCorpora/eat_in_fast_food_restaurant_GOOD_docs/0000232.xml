Entry 36:

 

 Filipinos are the shyest people I have ever known! Even around their own family and friends they are &quot;mahuya,&quot; shy. I don&apos;t know what it is that makes them shy, but it escalates around Americans! Maybe it&apos;s just in the orphanage that I encounter shy Filipinos around their friends. Even when the situation is fun or benefits them, they still do not jump at the opportunity. I look at it as considerate or humble--probably why I love Filipinos!

Just about every day this week, I have gone to the high school. I have had an absolute blast hanging out with my students and the orphans at school. We have played hours and hours of basketball and volleyball! I have made some unforgettable memories this week. We have shared laughter, memories, and stories. I pray that we can keep in touch!

 Every morning and after lunch, we walk the elementary kids to school. I met a few of Melody&apos;s friends last year, and they were so excited to see me! They wrote me letters. They are too sweet! It has been great seeing them and getting to know them better!

Thursday night, we watched a movie with the high school orphans because they haven&apos;t been having class. Their teachers are busy recording their grades, so the kids are just sitting in the classroom or roaming around. I&apos;m glad that I am here to take advantage of their free time!

Friday, we had a March Madness party! I brought some basketball decorations, and we got the kids some ice cream. We watched Like Mike. Bekah and I have noticed that most of the movies we have watched lately have had some sort of connection to orphans. It&apos;s pretty neat. After the Like Mike, we brought out the ice cream before watching the Squeakuel to Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Saturday, we surprised the fourth year orphans with a trip to Marbel, the nearest city. Marbel is about 40 minutes away. Nanay said the fourth year needed graduation shoes, and Bekah and I wanted to provide that for them. The boys picked out their shoes first and fast. The girls&apos; decision was not so fast! It was precious seeing them try on high heels, which none of them own. They had a great time.

 We had lunch after buying shoes. They love to eat at Jollybee, a fast food restaurant. Marbel is the closest town with a Jollybee. Bekah and I laughed because though they had a choice of hamburger and french fries or chicken and rice, they still chose chicken and rice! It reminded me of American Day when I told the kids they would not have any rice for the entire day--they were worried they wouldn&apos;t survive!

After lunch, we surprised them once again. Bekah took the boys shopping for something special that they could pick out--t-shirts, hats, etc. I took the girls to get earrings for graduation. They were even more indecisive about earrings than shoes. I bet we were looking for an hour! They picked out some beautiful earrings! Mary Joy doesn&apos;t have her ears pierced and didn&apos;t want to get them pierced, so I got her a ring. It was a lot of fun! We were exhausted after all the shopping and all fell asleep all the way home.

 Saturday afternoon I helped the girls with their chores around the orphanage. They were sweeping/raking the leaves with a &quot;silhig,&quot; a Filipino broom. They do this every morning at 5 a.m. This time, in the afternoon, I helped! They thought it was so funny to see an American sweeping like a Filipino! They took pictures of me! Saturday night, we had spa night for the girls! We massaged and painted nails, and we did facial masks for the high school girls. They loved it! We played Thumbelina while they waited for their turn.

Sunday after church, we played Twister! The kids had a blast! The game lasted almost the entire afternoon. I had a coloring book that the younger ones loved while they waited to play. I gave the winners of each Twister game a prize.

Later on, I played cards with the girls. We played some matching-cards game and Slap Jack. That&apos;s a fun one to play because it&apos;s fast-paced. They love to be competitive. It&apos;s so cool how the language barrier is almost inexistent when playing cards!

Sunday night, we had movie night for the elementary. They don&apos;t have school Monday, so we decided to treat them since we did for the high school. They watched Little Rascals! Such a cute movie!

Entry 35:

 

 Returning to the Philippines has been such a blessing! I surprised the kids when they came home from school--their faces were priceless! This trip has a completely different feel to it than the last time I was here. Because this is a familiar place, I feel at home. I surprised myself with how much Illonggo I remember! I am speaking to everyone so easily!

When I arrived Friday, I was greeted by many of the elementary kids. They didn&apos;t have school that afternoon. I was so glad they were home! After we played for a bit, the high school kids started to arrive. The most memorable reunion was with Brindy, one of the fourth year orphans. She speaks very good English, so she and I became great friends. She had a hint I would be visiting, but she didn&apos;t know when. We spotted her coming home so I hid until she got closer--I wanted to see her reaction! And it was worth it! She was so so surprised!!! I wish there were words to describe each reunion! She was laughing and embracing me forever! Jaypee was also especially happy to see me! Melody was probably the most shocked of everyone! She stopped in her tracks when she saw me, and her jaw hit the floor! I have missed them so much, but I am so relieved to see they are happy and doing so well! This trip will really help me cope with our separation when I return home. I just had to see them again and let th m know that I will never forget them! They have taught me so much, and it&apos;s great to come back and be reminded of how my life changed here. I am even staying in my old room! It&apos;s almost as if I never left!

 Friday night we watched Alvin and the Chipmunks. Finally, the orphan Alvin understands why every American yells at him, &quot;Allllvviiinnn!&quot; He loved it! I told him it was just for him! Saturday, I went to visit Dewayne and Ate Bebing, the old cook. I was so excited to see them. Dewayne remembered me, which made me so happy! He is so precious! Later in the afternoon, we did arts and crafts. I brought some projects to make jewelry, beaded key chains, and foam puppets. They had a blast and took all day. They are so creative already, and when given supplies they just go creative! After dinner, I presented them with &quot;pasalubong,&quot; souvenirs. I had a lot of help bringing the kids gifts from America. FBC Jackson&apos;s State Street Twenties, Trey McAlpin, and Coach Funches gave many DVDs to the orphanage! The kids love to watch movies. They only get to on special occasions. When they do, they always watch two or three! With summer approaching in April for them, I knew they would need to restock! They were so excited when I brought out the stack of DVDs. Baby Bob received a special gift from Crosby Mullins, which he loved! He was hugging and kissing the stuffed animal! It was precious! I told his caretaker to keep the letter and read it to him before bed. Thanks to Lifted in Faith and Aunt Linda, all of the girls received a silver cross necklace. It was very special, and they loved them. They all wore them to church the next morning! My brother Neal sent the boys beanbags from DORE. They love to play hacky-sac type games, so the beanbag was a real hit! Since then, they have been taking them everywhere and playing games with their friends at school. I also brought them some American candy. They loved the lollipops! For Nanay&apos;s house, I brought a picture book that I made on Shutterfly. I put the top 50 pictures in there from my three months. It will be a great way for the kids to remember all the fun times we shared! She was very grateful for it.

 Sunday morning we went to Amazing Grace Baptist Church. I got to see many of the members that I knew. They were very surprised! Each week, they celebrate the birthdays in church. Everyone knew I had a birthday last week so they made me go to the front! They all sang and came to shake my hand.

Sunday afternoon, I brought out the balloons and pump to make balloon animals for the first time!! It was a challenge that I mastered in the 5 hours that I pumped, twisted, and popped balloons! It was a big hit once the kids saw what I was doing. They kept telling me I was going to pop them! Then, they saw the animal shape and wanted more! We had a blast! It turned out to be an all day activity!

 Sunday night we went to the church where Tatay Bert now pastors. He is the pastor of Lamsugod Baptist Church, where he pastored 20 years ago. He is hoping to restore it. The service was very interesting and different from any other service I have attended. At the end, we had a karaoke contest! It was really funny, and the kids loved it! Monday, I went Lamsugod National High School, where I taught English, to surprise my students and the teachers! It was so much fun! I really thought I would never see many of my students again. Words can&apos;t express the joy I feel being able to see them again. I wish it were easier to stay in touch with people in the Philippines! I beg them to get facebook or email when they go to college! I never thought I would pray for facebook friends, but I really do! That&apos;s one of the only ways to keep up with them, but many of them will never have internet, so it&apos;s still not good enough! I stayed at the school all day, talking with my students. After lunch, we played basketball. It was very &quot;init,&quot; hot, but we didn&apos;t care. However, I did get a little sunburn! It&apos;s fun to be able to just hang out with them outside the classroom, which I didn&apos;t get to do much of. Red, Rosebert, Dexter, and a couple of the girls performed their dance for me. I always loved their hip-hop dances. I remembered a little that they taught me, so I danced with them! For some reason that class just makes me happy! They are smart, fun, and know how to laugh! I made so many great memories with them. I can&apos;t believe the next time I visit they won&apos;t be here--altogether at least. I thank God for this time now with them to solidify our relationship!

 Tuesday, Bekah and I went to Surallah to the Internet cafe. I needed to take my quiz for my Seminary Internet classes. While we were in town, we got four cakes for the kids. Since my birthday was last week, we had an excuse to randomly get cake! They loved it of course! Bekah and I had a blast surprising them and serving them. They love this weird, purple flavor called &quot;ube.&quot; I don&apos;t really understand exactly what flavor it is...I just know I don&apos;t like it! Bekah is here serving for three months like I did last fall. It has been fun getting to know her. We accidentally speak Illonggo to one another often! We have had fun kind of creating our own language. I have discovered that my favorite little word to say or add to any phrase is &quot;lang.&quot; They use it for emphasis in many different ways. Needless to say, I have emphasized almost everything I have said lately...lang! Today, we are going to the high school to help Richard teach an English class. He said he is teaching on the troublesome trio...to, too and two. Should be interesting to hear that from a Filipino. I am looking forward to it! &quot;Karon lang!&quot; Later! (I may be using that incorrectly or out of context, but I know that&apos;s what it means in some sense!)

Entry 34: Leaving One Home and Returning to Another

 

 Leaving the orphanage is no easy move. But the last days were the best days--days of memory and meaning. We shared our love with one another. We were able to let each other know just how special these three months have been. They held a program for me on my last day. We began with a devotional followed by games and entertainment that evening. It was the most memorable day in the Philippines. We shared laughter, love, and tears. Tears of the best memories and growth of my life...Tears from the pivot point of my life...Tears from the joy of where Christ saved me from to where He has brought me...Tears for the children who I feel have become my own...Tears for the teachers I have grown to dearly love...Tears for the hardships and the perseverance it taught me...Tears for the woman I came here as and the one I&apos;m leaving as...Tears of sadness yet tears of happiness for the relationships I&apos;ve made...Tears sweeter than any I&apos;ve cried before...I&apos;ll cherish those tears of the best three months of my life.

 

I shared a message to let them know what they mean to me and what they taught me during my stay:

When I arrived, I expected to be a stranger for at least a week. But you didn&apos;t let that happen. You invited me into your family the first day with open, loving arms. You did everything possible to make my adjustment smooth. Then you let me &quot;help,&quot; which is what I came to do. But, you may have ended up helping me more than I helped you--you taught me how to serve the Lord with every ounce within me. You taught me patience, gentleness, and humility. You taught me unconditional love--a love that never fails--a love like God&apos;s love. You gave me the chance to mentor, befriend, and, most of all, be a mother. You taught me how to give my life for a better life of someone else. You taught me how to live like Jesus! You changed my life--you helped God shape me for His plans. I know we all wish His plans were here at Fowler and Tucker Home, but God used you to teach me for what is coming. I have learned more in these last three months than my entire life because I learned how to live! I truly experienced &quot;JOY--Jesus, Others, You.&quot; You have encouraged me and strengthened me to follow God&apos;s lead. You have impacted my life in such a way that I will never be the same. I feel like I am leaving my second family, my second home, but I can&apos;t say goodbye because I&apos;m not going anywhere. I&apos;ll always be here in my thoughts and prayers. And, I promise I will come back to visit. The most influential people in my life will always be part of my life--so you can expect to see me again! Thank you for teaching me and loving me. You helped God make me-&quot;me.&quot; I&apos;ll never forget the best three months of my life! I love you!

Entry 33: Final Days

 

Since my return from Cebu, I have been preaching with Tatay at elementary schools around Lamsugod. We went to schools that I didn&apos;t know existed on roads that I didn&apos;t know were drivable. It was like the indigenous areas are right at your fingertips if you have a car. If you don&apos;t have a car, they seem so far away. Tatay said those schools have never been preached at by BTEA, and they are right in our backyard! It was great to be able to reach them in my last week. Here is a sample presentation of the Gospel that I share:

 I have some Good News to share with you today! Who likes Good News? The Good News is that God loves each one of you! He is the one who created you, and He made us all very different! He made some of us with dark skin and some &quot;puti,&quot; white. God made some of us with a flat nose and some with a long nose. But, He loves us all equally! He loves you so much that He wants to have a personal relationship with you. But, we have a problem. The problem is not with God because He is perfect and holy. The problem is with you and me. We are sinners, and the Bible says sin separates us from God. Because sin cannot enter Heaven, we cannot have a relationship with God. But because God loves you so much, He created a solution to the sin problem. The solution is God&apos;s one and only Son, Jesus Christ. God sent Jesus to this earth many years ago, and Jesus lived a lot like you and me. He went to school. He had a family, and when Jesus grew up, He became a carpenter. But, Jesus was also very different from you and me. He was perfect! He never sinned! He never even told one little lie! But one day when Jesus was 33 years old, soldiers took Him and beat Him. They spit in His face. Then, they nailed Him to a cross where He died. Did someone who was perfect deserve to die? No, but He died for you and me. Jesus died to pay for our sin because the Bible says the penalty for sin is death in Hell. Because we are all sinners, we all deserve to go to Hell. Hell is a place where fire burns forever, and worms eat your skin. You&apos;re eternally separated from the love of God. Three days after Jesus died, He rose from the dead! He&apos;s alive today! Do you know where Jesus lives? In Heaven and He wants you to live with Him and experience eternal happiness and joy! But, how do we get to Heaven? Can you take a very big airplane to get to Heaven? Can you climb to the top of a mountain and jump to Heaven? Can you pay enough pesos to get to Heaven? Can you do enough good works to get to Heaven? Sometimes, we think doing something good will take away something bad. But the only thing that can take away sin is death. There&apos;s only one way to get to Heaven. That&apos;s through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. He died to give you forgiveness of your sins so you can enter the gates of Heaven. We do not deserve this, but it is God&apos;s grace and His free gift to us. Do you like free gifts? When you receive a gift for Christmas, do you have to return it after Christmas? No, it&apos;s yours forever! The same goes for God&apos;s gift to you. Once you receive the gift of Heaven through a personal relationship with Jesus, it can never be taken away. The Bible says all you have to do is ask, and God is just waiting to give it to you. He is waiting for you to choose Him! The Bible says when you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead then you will be saved from eternity in Hell and given eternity in Heaven with God! Sounds easy right? That&apos;s because it is! It&apos;s the grace of a loving Heavenly Father. Choose Him today! If you want to put your trust in Jesus, I will lead you in a prayer. This is not a prayer between you and me. This is from your heart to God. Let&apos;s pray.

Dear Jesus,
I know that I am a sinner, and I cannot save myself. Thank you for dying for my sins so that I don&apos;t have to die. Thank you for coming back to life and giving me eternal life in Heaven with you. I ask for your forgiveness. Please fill me with your Spirit. Thank you for this free gift, and thank you for loving me.
In Jesus&apos; Name,
Amen.

If you just put your trust in Jesus, will you raise your hand? This is the best decision of your life because it gives you life in Heaven! You can tell your family about trusting Jesus, so they can have life in Heaven with you! We don&apos;t have to fear death if we trust Jesus. We don&apos;t have to fear leaving our family because we know we will be together in Heaven! I am so happy for your decision! The Bible says when you trust Jesus you become a child of God. I trust Jesus, so I am a child of God. So if God is your Father and my Father, what is our relationship? That&apos;s right! We are brothers and sisters in Christ! Now, I have Filipino brothers and sisters, and you have an American sister! This makes me very happy because we share a home! So, if I cannot visit your home in the Philippines and if you cannot visit me in America, where will I see you again? Yes, in Heaven! Remember, nothing can take Jesus away from you. He died once and for all your sins, including the sins you will commit tomorrow. In the Bible, Jesus says, &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot; We can rejoice in this reassurance of eternal life together in Heaven! Thank you for letting me share this Good News with you!


 Saturday, my fourth year students and I held a community service project at the school. The students supplied the rice, vegetables, and meat that we prepared. Early Saturday morning, we met at the school and began to build a fire to cook. Not only do I not know how to cook for 100 people, but I don&apos;t have a clue how to cook Filipino food! It doesn&apos;t look too difficult. The trick or complicated factor I didn&apos;t recognize is that cooking over a campfire is a lot different than a stove--the food cooks super fast! Students were slicing the vegetables, and I thought I would go ahead and heat the cooking oil and start the spices. Well, little did I know that cooking oil was ready within a minute. When I received the chopped garlic, I just threw it in...explosion!!! We all screamed! It was then that I decided the one American should not cook the food--I turned it over to the students! They said, &quot;Take two!&quot;

 Tatay arranged for the 100 people to come to our community service day. We preached to them, led games, fed them lunch, and gave them rice to take home. They were so grateful, and the event was great! I know the students learned a lot and saw how easy it is to serve the community if they all chip in! It was also a great way to hang out with them one last time! After the service, we began to clean up. We had speakers for music during the program, so we played music as we began to clean. It quickly turned into a dance and karaoke party as we cleaned! I enjoyed just having fun with them after a day of hard but rewarding work!

I experienced my first Filipino funeral Saturday night. In the Philippines, funerals last for at least two weeks. The high school orphans had been going every night. I attended the last night before the burial service Sunday. Nanay and Tatay were the leaders of the services. Each night, Tatay shared the gospel and Nanay led the singing. I was a little hesitant to attend the funeral because I didn&apos;t want to distract from the service. Anywhere there&apos;s an American, the attention is shifted. I didn&apos;t want that to happen. The orphans said it would be fine. So, I went. It was a different but unique experience. I got to hear the family share their memories about their father and husband, the late Snowell Boacua. His passing was very sudden and unexpected, so it was very difficult on the family. I enjoyed seeing the community come together to support them.

After the service, everyone socializes for as long as they want to stay. Because the service was outside the family&apos;s house, it was open to the community. A drunk man stumbled in to the social crowd, and of course, he found the American! He walked up to me and said, &quot;Oh, Wow!&quot; And then he yelled, &quot;What is your name?&quot; About that time, spit came flying from his mouth all over my face! That&apos;s when I decided to tell him my Filipino name, Ligaya, instead of Natalie because the syllables were less likely to create a spitting motion! Then he tried to ask me where I was from saying, &quot;Where are you now?&quot; I answered, &quot;Diri!&quot; That means here in Illonggo. He couldn&apos;t figure out why I wasn&apos;t answering the question right! Nanay and the orphans were just laughing, as he was surprised with my Illonggo! Someone came and took him out, and that&apos;s when I found out what everyone calls him. They call him &quot;Atras.&quot; When he speaks to you he takes one step forward, and you must take three steps backwards or &quot;atras.&quot; If only I had known that before the spit came flying at me! Just another laugh or everyone!

 

On the way home from the funeral, the stars were so bright and beautiful. We walked home watching the stars. Brindy and I both looked up at the same time and saw a shooting star! Of course, we yelled ecstatically! She had never seen a shooting star before! I told her she had to make a wish and that we would make a wish together since we saw it together. We wished to remain friends forever! That is also my prayer for her as well as all the others. It&apos;s difficult because they don&apos;t have Internet and snail mail is unreliable that far away. I am going to try my best to keep in touch with them and pray for them as they grow!

 The next morning, we attended the burial service for the same funeral. Nanay suggested I sing at the funeral! I sang Amazing Grace, but I was very nervous. I didn&apos;t know how to sing for the family that lost their loved one, but God pulled me through. I just prayed that the words of the song would calm their spirit. After the service, we walked half a mile to the gravesite. Mr. Snowel was a soldier for twenty years. That was the first time I attended a funeral for a soldier. It was very moving.

A few days later, I attended another funeral in a tribe in the mountains. We drove through the river to get there! Literally, this was somewhere so remote that cars should not drive to. But, we did! I got to preach at the funeral about life after death! I assured them we don&apos;t have to fear death if we know what&apos;s next! Their faces lit up as I shared the Gospel. I know the Holy Spirit was at work in that tribe! After the service, we fed them and gave them clothes and rice. It was an opportunity for us to serve the community!

 This week when the orphans were at school, I was writing many letters to everyone. I heard strange noises coming from one of the rooms in the boys dorm. Then I heard roosters crowing much louder than they should have been. They were in the dorm! I walked in to see if they were at the window or actually in the room. It was hilarious! But, it was also nasty because they were scared and leaving little presents everywhere in the boys&apos; room! Once again, I was introduced to something about which I believe I can say, &quot;Only in the Philippines!&quot; I have said that so many times the last three months!

Another funny story I discovered on my very last day is something the girls have told me from day one, &quot;Guapa ka.&quot; That means, &quot;You&apos;re beautiful.&quot; I wondered why they were saying it more often lately and at such random times. It wasn&apos;t until the last day that I figured that out! Brindy was telling me something in Illonggo when I asked her to repeat it a few times to understand. After the third repetition she just said, &quot;Guapa ka!&quot; My jaw hit the floor, and I just laughed uncontrollably! I knew that&apos;s not what she was telling me, but she gave up and just said something that I do understand. It became clear that each time I couldn&apos;t understand them and they couldn&apos;t explain it they just said, &quot;Guapa ka!&quot; I had wondered why the random compliments especially when I had just woken up! What a great sense of humor they have!

Entry 32: Farewell Lamsugod National High School

 

 Thursday afternoon, Lamsugod National High School held a program entitled, &quot;A Tribute to Ma&apos;am Natalie.&quot; I was so surprised when they told me they planned an event for me! It was such a special celebration! It was a celebration of the great memories I have made there--not a goodbye! So many people spoke and gave their appreciation through gifts. I have never felt so honored. They were just so glad that I came at a time where they were short one teacher--an English teacher, at that! It was God&apos;s timing and His good and perfect Will! I don&apos;t feel like I deserve any recognition because I enjoyed teaching them so much! But I will cherish their gratitude forever! We danced, laughed, sang, and were entertained! I thought I would cry during the ceremony, but it was too much of a celebration of the good times for me to cry! I wrote letters to all my students and the faculty. Ma&apos;am Tupas was my mentor. It was a special time for me to thank her and give her a small gift. She always told me she loved my perfume. So, I gave her some to remember me. She loved it! It was also a special time for me to tell them how much I have enjoyed the opportunity to teach English and moral values. I was able to tell them just how much they will always mean to me. Here is my speech:

Farewell Message to Lamsugod National High School
Ma&apos;am Natalie Brown Stephens
November 25, 2010

 Teaching at Lamsugod National High School will soon become one of my fondest memories of the last three months in the Philippines. When I arrived, you welcomed me with open arms. You gave me the opportunity to contribute to the knowledge of the rising generation. You let me share my ideas with them, and you allowed me to build relationships. Lamsugod National High School will always hold a special place in my heart. From reading about Baucis and Philemon to making bookmarks to prepositions to supercalifragilisticexpialidocious--I cherish each moment on this campus. Each morning, I was filled with excitement as I walked to school no longer as a student but a teacher for the first time. It was a new experience for all of us and a unique one at that. My first class to teach was certainly unique--the students were Filipino! I hope you students enjoyed the experience more than struggled to understand me! I did my best, and you gave your best. I am so proud of all of you. My first day, all you did was giggle and smile at me--that&apos;s not a bad thing. But by the last day, you were my friends, and giggling was the result of fun instead of shyness or confusion.

I came here so eager to help, and you gave me the chance to take on the challenge. I enjoyed helping you with your newspaper and journalism students. Because I cannot be here to continue to help you launch your newspaper, I have left some journalism-writing guides. Because I don&apos;t want the work we have started here to leave with me. Press on! You are all very smart and dedicated students. Don&apos;t give up when you feel you can&apos;t move forward. Remember anything is possible with God! Lean on Him when you feel you cannot make it yourself. I will keep you all in my prayers! I know God is shaping many leaders here at Lamsugod National High School. Follow His lead! God&apos;s way is much better than your own--that&apos;s why I&apos;m here. My plan didn&apos;t involve the Philippines, but God&apos;s did! If I didn&apos;t let go of what I wanted and follow Him then I wouldn&apos;t be here! I would have missed the many blessings you have poured upon me and the wonderful new friendships I have made. These friendships I will cherish for the rest of my life! You are all so special to me, and there won&apos;t be a day that goes by that I don&apos;t think of you! Thank you for making my time here so special and memorable. I will miss you dearly! I don&apos;t like goodbyes, but to me, this is not goodby--this is just &quot;I&apos;ll see you later.&quot; I hope to visit again. But more than that, I hope you all have put your trust in Jesus Christ so that I can rejoice with you when we meet again in Heaven. I am so thankful and have been blessed by you being a part of the best three months of my life! Mahal kita!

 

Following my speech I sang, &quot;To Forget You&quot; by Michael Binghay of the Philippines.

Many days have passed away and now the time has come.
The time for me to leave and say, &quot;Goodbye to everyone.&quot;
The time I&apos;ve shared with you before will turn to memory.
To forget you is hard for me to do.

Chorus: It&apos;s hard to say goodbye to people whom I&apos;ve learned to love.
People whom I&apos;ve shared the joy and sorrow all away.
Today marks the day that I will start missing you.
To forget you is hard for me to do.

(Repeat all)

Soon, I&apos;ll be going...
Soon, I&apos;ll be leaving...
Soon, I&apos;ll be missing you.
To forget you is hard for me to do.

(Chorus 2x)

To forget you is hard for me to do. (2x)

Entry 31: Back to Uncle Dick&apos;s Home

 

 I returned to the orphanage Saturday. Let me tell you, it was the sweetest reunion! When we turned the corner into the driveway, my face lit up! I was ecstatic to see them running out to meet me! Oh, I missed them so much! When I stepped out of the van, which is the new vehicle that they got, I was attacked by the biggest hug ever! They just yelled, &quot;Ate. Natalie!&quot; It felt so good to be back in my Filipino home! I really felt as though I was coming home. I hugged everyone else and told them how much I missed them! They are all so precious! Though leaving them for two weeks was hard, it allowed us to practice goodbye and gave us the chance to rejoice in reunion. We played games the rest of the afternoon! I just loved being able to hug each one of them over and over as we were so excited to be together again! I couldn&apos;t lose my smile! Baby Bob has gotten even cuter and was so happy to see me! I hope he is old enough now to remember me the next time I visit. He is so precious!

The orphanage was able to buy their new vehicle--a white, Chevrolet van. Thank you to all of you for your prayers and support to speed this process. God&apos;s timing is perfect, because the old, green jeepney broke down last week. They will probably be able to fix it, but not only was it not big enough, it died at the perfect time! God is so good!

 

 Sunday night, I started tutoring again! The boys missed me so much, and we had fun with our homework! I helped Carlos read and Jaypee sing! Jaypee started to sing the middle, which is probably the only part he knew, of the hymn &quot;I Love You Lord.&quot; I recognized and finished it for him! He perked up! That is one of my favorite hymns. We sang it over and over as Carlos was half-reading and half-singing with us! It was then that I thought about the fact that they don&apos;t have a mother to sing to them every night. I guess I didn&apos;t notice it before because Baby Bob&apos;s caretaker sings to him. Jaypee just put his head on my shoulder as we sang the hymn--that&apos;s how I know they&apos;re not too old for it or haven&apos;t had enough of it. There&apos;s just something sweet about singing hymns to precious little children! I am cherishing my last days here. I have only been here two days since Cebu and have had some precious moments that will make it even harder to leave. I pray that God will protect our hearts as He prepares us for the next task ahead.

 

 We received our package from my high school, Simpson County Academy, while I was in Cebu. Thankfully, they waited for me to open it so I could experience their joy and gratefulness! After church, we gathered and opened our boxes of school supplies! The kids were so excited when they saw the boxes! I had to document the whole thing as we opened them. They were filled with so many things that the kids need--notebooks, backpacks, erasers, pencil sharpeners, pens, pencils, markers, crayons, glue, books, and Bibles. I have been with the kids and tutored them long enough to see their lack of school supplies. This is such a blessing for them! Now, when I help Carlos, Jaypee, and Shaolin with their math they won&apos;t have to scribble out their work and start over. The erasers and pencils and pencil sharpeners are the most needed items here--school-related. Now, some of the little boys can have a boyish backpack. I know they may not care if their bag is pink--they&apos;re just glad to have one--but anything we can do to help! Pens are like a treasure here. You go to the store that just has thousands of pens and ink refills and pick out the one you think writes the best. Then, you put your name on it so you don&apos;t lose it, and no one steals it! They literally use each pen until the ink is gone. I usually lose all of mine before I reach that point. The abundance of pens we received today is a blessing that will hopefully ease their minds about losing a pen.


 

 We received some reading materials and Bibles for the kids. They love to practice reading English! One of the Bibles was called &quot;My Little Bible.&quot; I gave that to Baby Bob! He loved it and wanted to pose with it for me! They were all so happy to see evidence of those who love and pray for them from America! Nanay Ray was so grateful! She has been praying for the safe delivery of the packages. She knows how much you all care for the orphans, and she cannot thank you enough. The kids sang a &quot;Thank You Ever So Much&quot; song to the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; tune. Please imagine these kids singing that to you--they really are grateful and truly blessed by you!

 

In the boxes, my dad sent me some journalism/newsletter guides for the orphans to continue their newsletter. I also have a copy for the high school as they launch their newspaper and the Bible school here at the orphanage for their library. For some reason, there are not many resources in the Philippines on how to start a newspaper or newsletter. I know these books will help them continue the newsletter, which I hope will become tradition! Today was a day of resources--resources that will be put to use and remind them each time they use them that they are loved by you!

Entry 30: Another Orphanage!

 

 Friday, I got to experience something very special! We were back in Cebu, the main island, before everyone went separate ways. Pastor Sigfred Verdeflor lives in Cebu City and his wife is a nurse at an orphanage. He told me about the orphanage a couple of weeks ago, and I told him I would love to visit if we have time in Cebu. We had all day Friday in Cebu to rest and be ready for our early Saturday flights. Friday morning, I was having breakfast with the Filipino pastors. Pastor Sigfred said he would take us to the orphanage! Pastor Lonnie leaned over and said quietly, &quot;Because June wants to look at the babies.&quot; I almost jumped out of my seat!! Pastor June and his wife Glenda are not able to have children. I knew that they were thinking of adopting eventually, but I didn&apos;t know they were ready to start the process! And, I got to go with him to look at the babies! It was such an awesome experience; because I hope to one day adopt children, as well. I feel like it is such an intimate or personal thing that I never thought I would experience that with anyone but myself. Pastor June&apos;s wife Glenda was not in Cebu. They talked about him visiting the orphanage while he was in town. He took pictures to show her. I asked him how he would choose, and he said they will pray and wait for the one they fall in love with.

 

 When we arrived, I already had my camera out to document the process! I was so excited! This orphanage has 92 kids! And, they said there is a waiting list for more kids to come. They do a lot of adoptions also. Because it is so big, they have their own school--elementary through high school. There were three babies, two girls and one boy. They were precious. Pastor June met the first baby girl and took her picture. She had her eyes on him! It was so sweet seeing him meet each one of them. The second was a baby boy, John. He and Pastor June hit it off! He took pictures of John and went to meet the last. The third was another girl. She was scared of me. But, she loved Pastor June, which is all that really matters!

 After meeting all three of the infants, he gravitated toward the little boy, John, again. John was so interested in Pastor June. He couldn&apos;t take his eyes off of him. I actually saw them have their first moment, eye contact. When we left to tour the rest of the orphanage, Pastor June admitted that he wants a boy! I told him he could have both! He said he wanted a boy so he could be a pastor one day. I said, &quot;His name is already from the Bible! This John could be &quot;John the Southern Baptist!&apos;&quot; If you have been to the Philippines you understand that joke! If you are Baptist in the Philippines, you claim to be &quot;Southern Baptist&quot; no matter where in the Philippines. I think it is so funny. That shows that the Baptist evangelists who planted churches here were mostly from the South. Pastor June liked that suggestion. I think he was excited to talk to his wife about John!

 

I feel so blessed to have been a part of Pastor June&apos;s search for a baby. It was such a sweet experience. He and Glenda have been praying for a baby for years, but sometimes God wants to give us a child we can&apos;t create. I know they will be blessed through adoption as they take on one of God&apos;s children as their own!

Entry 29: Isle Style

 

We arrived in the Camotes Islands on Saturday evening. It was a long journey from the Bantayan Islands to the Camotes. We had to pass through the main island of Cebu to get to the next boat. While we waited for the next boat, we went to the SM, which I believe stands for Super Market. We got our groceries for the next week and just hung out there. We had about three hours there. While I was looking around, I met three kids. I just talked with them for a while, maybe 30 minutes. They were precious. Two of them were teenagers and could understand English very well. I made sure they knew all about Jesus as they were asking me why I came to the Philippines. I got to know them pretty well. The oldest one said he was not in school because his twin sister is schooling now. Many times in the Philippines, a family will have to take turns going to school. When one gets through, another will go to school, and the one who finished will help pay for the other sibling. He told me his birthday was this week, and I asked him how he was going to celebrate. He told me he didn&apos;t have any money, and he would just thank God for the year and pray for another one. Isn&apos;t that what we all should do each year? What a humbling experience. After we parted, I continued to run into them around the market. I decided to take them into the grocery section and buy them some ice cream. It was the least I could do to show them that I care about them and the birthday boy. They were so excited but shy at first! I told them to pick out whatever they wanted. The youngest one said, &quot;This is my first time!&quot; She had never had ice cream before! What a blessing it was for me to give her that experience for the first time! Their smiles were priceless!

 BTEA has never been to the Camotes Islands. This is the first time, and I feel honored to be a part of it. Most everywhere has at least had film showings, because the Filipino pastors of BTEA do that year round. This week we are preaching in all the schools and doing film showings in as many barangays as possible. This was my first time to experience film showings. Almost everyone in town comes to see the show, because they rarely get to see any type of film. We start by showing a movie called Alpha and Omega about the life of Christ. When Jesus is on the cross, we pause the film and preach the gospel. At the first film showing, I looked to my left at the kids when the video paused. I watched as a twelve-year-old girl wiped the tears from her eyes as she saw her Savior nailed to a cross. There&apos;s nothing more wonderful than when someone realizes the weight of their sin and the grace of their Savior!

 In the middle of the movie, we introduce ourselves and the girls sing. I sang, &quot;I Could Sing of Your Love Forever.&quot; Pastor Stone gave the message and had an invitation, inviting those who want a relationship with Jesus to come forward. The first night, there were 40-50 decisions. The next night, there were about 350 decisions! How wonderful that the Kingdom of God is growing on this island! I have never seen that many people, young and old, come to know Christ! For many of them, it was their first time to hear the gospel. At the first film showing, the little girl next to me wiped the tears from her eyes as she saw Jesus being raised on the cross. Her heart was changed that night. I know she will live her life for Christ with such a beautiful heart.

Many of the schools here are very small. When I preach to them, I am able to make eye contact with all of them. It makes it so much more precious to see all of them receiving the Good News of Jesus Christ! At each school, I preach the same message, but at each school, I see new faces, hearts and souls. How important it is that we never grow tired of sharing the Good News--because it may be the first time someone has ever heard of the love of Jesus!

 Tuesday, classes were canceled for another Muslim holiday. I went to the beach to exercise and met about six kids there. They exercised with me and were just precious! Only one young girl remained until the end of my workout. So I spent some time just getting to know her. She was young and didn&apos;t understand everything I said. So I thought the best thing to do was just to pray with and for her. She bowed her head and clasped her hands together and let me pray for her. I know that God touched her heart during that prayer to let her know He loves her. I am so thankful for opportunities like that to pour God&apos;s love into His people!

We finished all the schools in the Camotes Islands. By the last day, we had traveled every road, and kids would be so excited to see us again as we traveled to the last schools. I really felt like we had touched the entire island with our visit. I know God is at work there. When we arrived, we felt darkness around the island. But as we left, we were bid goodbye by so many familiar faces with the light of Jesus shining from them! I felt as if we saw the island transform. I will continue to pray that God waters the seeds we planted this week.

Entry 28: Island Preaching

 

 We have preached in every school in the Bantayan islands. There are 60 schools. Most of them are elementary schools. The Philippines started a campaign to have at least an elementary school in every barangay of the Philippines by 2000. They haven&apos;t reached that goal yet, but their efforts are evident. Thursday, I went island hopping to preach at the smaller islands around the main one. There are eight schools on five different islands. These islands were the poorest places I have been. When we arrived, we would anchor our boat and walk through shallow water to reach the island. The residents would come out to see the American approaching them. On one island, we were met by this kid named Loto. He became our tour guide. When we would get to the islands, we would have to ask where the school was. Then, we would walk through the neighborhood to the school. Loto made it easy for us this time. About eight other kids joined him. As he was &quot;leading&quot; us, he was actually running; he was yelling, &quot;Americano! Americano!&quot; By the time we reached the houses that Loto had passed, the residents had come out to see the Americans. It was like a parade--the streets were lined with people! By the time we reached the school, all of the kids were waiting for us! This island had really never seen an American before.

 

 We gathered the kids, and Ben preached to them. After Ben gave the message, Pastor Lonnie volunteered me to sing. So I walked over and started to sing, &quot;I Could Sing of Your Love Forever,&quot; when Pastor Lonnie tapped me on the shoulder. He said, &quot;I think you should sing the other song in Tagalog.&quot; He interrupted my serious song to tell me to sing a Filipino Christmas song in their language! After putting me on the spot like that--he embarrassed me too! The Filipino pastors love to do that to us! After we finished with the message, Loto guided us back to our boat the same way--running and screaming, &quot;Americano! Americano!&quot; It was hilarious, and he was precious! Once we reached our boat, Loto got in the water with us. I asked him if he was going to follow us by swimming! When I would speak to him in Filipino, he would just giggle and smile. What a precious little community!

On the smallest island we visited, we could see the ocean on all sides just by turning around. After we preached at the school, we looked for something to eat. There was literally nothing there but homes. They had a small cantina, but they didn&apos;t sell noodles or mineral water. A nearby resident said, in Filipino of course, &quot;Come. Eat at my house.&quot; I thought he was just going to give us boiled mineral water for our noodles. But, he fed us his meal. It was an experience like I&apos;ve never had before--being taken into a home and taken care of by a stranger. It was like the times in the Bible where Jesus says to go and preach and your needs will be met. That&apos;s what happened to us! God provided for our needs through a generous family. We tried to pay them for the meal, but they wouldn&apos;t take it. I wanted to insist, but that would take away their opportunity to bless us. What a humbling experience to be taken care of the way the disciples and preachers were in the Biblical times. It just shows that Jesus&apos; promises and miracles are still alive if we will just allow Him to show us.

 

Each island had many pigs and dried/salted fish. It was very smelly, to say the least. The pigs don&apos;t know how lucky they are, living with a view of the ocean and the waves! Filipinos love to eat dried fish, but they just smell so badly! On an island, you can see why they would have so many fish. They also had seaweed and coral everywhere to dry. They would sell it to the main islands to make medicines and other things--that also didn&apos;t smell great! Those are the main trades of the little islands. It was interesting to see the fish and seaweed everywhere. Though the pigs didn&apos;t really fit in--that must be another of their trades. I saw more baby pigs on these islands than anywhere else.

 

 We have had a blast so far. With this small a group, we are able to hang out and just have fun. After we finished preaching to all 60 schools, we had a volleyball tournament. We were all exhausted, so there was very little talent and lots of laughter! I have enjoyed getting to know the Filipino pastors. I didn&apos;t realize that I know one of the pastor&apos;s parents from this summer&apos;s medical clinic! I just loved his parents and grew close to them this summer. When I found out he is their son, I told him that I actually know all about him from his mother&apos;s stories! They are such sweet people! I am going to write them a letter for him to give them when he sees them for Christmas.

 

I ate some abobo squid, which tastes nothing like calamari! We saw some cool starfish and sea snakes that look like coral! There are so many beautiful things around these islands--the water, the sunrise and sunset, the beaches, and the people. I feel blessed to have been able to visit and share the most important message of their lives. I pray their faith grows and that the island just explodes for Jesus!

&quot;For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom His whole family in Heaven and on Earth derives its name. I pray that out of His glorious riches He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the believers, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.&quot;

Entry 27: On to Preaching

 

 My last few days of teaching were wonderful and sad. We completed our practicum. Every student had to make a proposal of a community service project. We will do community service as a class on November 27, my last Saturday in the Philippines. I enjoyed grading their ideas--they were all so creative! Some elaborated on how their project would change the community and eventually the world. They have such big hearts! On November 27, we will feed 100 needy families in Lamsugod, the community surrounding the school. We will have games and activities for the children and preach the gospel, as well. I hope this will show the students that though they may not be able to change the community individually, but they can together! It was such a blessing to be a part of their lives these few months. Many of them have impacted my life, and I will keep in contact with some forever!

Friday, I went to the doctor for testing to figure out why I have had stomach pain for two weeks. It was almost an all day event. I still do not know exactly what the problem has been, but it seems it could be a parasite. Thank you for all of your prayers. I really don&apos;t want this to get in the way of my mission for this final month! We went to the hospital so early that the ER was the only office open. We waited there until the clinic opened. While there, I was occupied by the chaos around me. A large truck pulled up to the emergency entrance, and doctors ran over to the truck with a stretcher. I watched as they unloaded the patient. I knew she must have been unconscious or gone. They wheeled her right passed me to a section called &quot;Resuscitation.&quot; Her loved ones were frantic, begging the doctors to help her. But, it was too late. They had hope that was broken in a matter of seconds. I watched as they went to say their good-byes. Life is short--I just pray that those people know Christ and will meet again someday. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to spread the gospel to everyone, so we don&apos;t have to fear death but be comforted by our hope of reuniting. This has been an addition to the message I share lately. So many people are afraid of death, but with Jesus, death is not scary. It&apos;s just the doorway to eternity! I have shared that with many students at Lamsugod High School. It&apos;s an obvious way to make it clear that it is important to share the gospel with your friends and family. I hope their fear turned to faith.

 Mr. Tebow came to the orphanage this weekend. The kids were so excited to see him. They have been asking me for months, &quot;When is Uncle Bob coming?&quot; Finally, I was able to tell them that a big surprise would arrive Friday. They all ran into his arms when he got out of the van. He brought hot pandesal, hot bread, for the kids. They love bread! Friday night, Mr. Tebow found out that it was Jimboy&apos;s birthday. Usually the kids have one birthday party a month to celebrate the birthdays of the month. Mr. Tebow would miss the November party, so he arranged to have it that night! We ran to get cake and ice cream--a real treat for the kids! They were so excited to celebrate with Mr. Tebow. After the cake and ice cream, Mr. Tebow continued a tradition the kids look forward to each visit. They watched one of Timmy&apos;s football games. The orphans always ask when Timmy will visit, and Mr. Tebow says as soon as he can--he&apos;s playing football right now. They love watching the films. On Friday, we watched the Sugar bowl, and on Saturday, we watched the Georgia/Florida game. While there, Mr. Tebow also bought screens for the buildings to keep the creatures out! This is such an answered prayer! This may mean the end of mosquito nets for the orphanage! They will begin working on the installation soon. They have also started the search for a new vehicle for the orphanage to travel safely with the kids. God is so good. Everything came together to allow these big issues to be dealt with. God&apos;s timing is perfect, and He is taking care of His children!

 

 Sunday, we left for the airport. I was so sad to leave the orphans, but it is good practice for when I have to leave them for America. They know I can&apos;t stay forever. Hopefully this short time away will prepare them for when I have to leave for a longer period of time. We flew to Manila to wait for the other Americans. Our team is Pastor Stone, Ben Pickett, Whitney Whittington, and me. While waiting for them in Manila, I went to the Mall of Asia, which is absolutely humongous! I had a good time exploring. I had Starbucks and went to a movie--two of my favorite American things to do! The team arrived late Sunday night, and we went to the airport at 3 a.m. to fly to the islands in Cebu. Once we landed in Cebu, we met the Filipino pastors and drove three hours to catch a ferry to the Batayan islands. It was a long journey!

 Tuesday, we preached to high schools and elementary schools in Santa Fe, Cebu. We took a boat to another small island to preach. The boats here are so cool! They balance by bamboo beams. Once we got to the island, Teddy, a Filipino pastor, and I took a motorcycle to the high school. There were three of us on the motorcycle--the Filipino way! It was hilarious. After we preached, we walked back to the shore and met the rest of the group to head back to the hotel for lunch. This is what the two weeks will be like. Some nights, we plan to have film showings. We will show a film about Jesus and then preach the gospel. I have never done one before, so I am excited to experience that!

Entry 26: Senior Trip

 

 Friday night, I called the senior orphans into a meeting after dinner. I told them that after breakfast the next morning, they needed to wear pants, tennis shoes, and a hat. Some of them suspected what we were doing, so I tricked them even more by telling them we were going to T.Boli, a nearby village, to do community service. Really, we were going to Lake Sebu to see the Seven Falls and ride the zip line! The next morning, we had our breakfast and met near the vehicle. When I told them the truth, they were so excited! They have never been, but they only live 30 minutes away from it. I knew that this was an experience they would never get unless someone did it for them. Nanay was already planning to take me, but I told her I did not want to miss spending time with them to go. So, we decided we could take the seniors and the college students! Their eyes just lit up the whole drive there!

 When we arrived, we went straight to the zip line! The waterfalls were breathtaking! The zip line went over some of the falls! The kids were so scared, but I told them they didn&apos;t have a choice but to ride! And, no one regretted it! I rode with Rosela. She was screaming, and I was taking pictures the whole time! I managed to get a picture of us mid-ride! You can see the joy in her face! The zip line was a package deal. We had to ride back the other direction on another line. Once we reached the end, we walked down a trail to the bottom of the biggest waterfall! We stood at the bottom and got wet by the mist that it created. We loved it so much, we were screaming and dancing in the mist! It really was the experience of a lifetime! To be able to do something like that with the kids was one of my greatest memories. After we were wet and getting hungry, we walked back up the mountain to the van. We drove to the resort Punta Isla to have lunch in a floating restaurant! The restaurant was in the lake beside the resort. We had to take a little boat to get there. The food was delicious. Lake Sebu is known for its tilapia, so we ordered tilapia cooked every way you can imagine! I have never seen the kids eat like that! It was such a treat for them, and they took advantage of the delicious food! After lunch, we went to a native T.Boli souvenir shop where we all got something to help us remember the trip. Most of the souvenirs were beaded items. We left with necklaces, rings, and bracelets. The day was such a great experience, and none of us will ever forget!

 

The kids were so grateful for their experience! They couldn&apos;t stop talking about it the rest of the weekend. Rosela came to me before dinner Saturday night and told me how much fun she had. She said, &quot;That was the most joyful experience of my life! I will never forget it. Thank you.&quot; I will never forget her expressing that to me! She has such a beautiful heart! I know all of the kids felt that way--I could see it in their faces!

 

 Saturday night, we went to a birthday party in Surallah. All of the orphans were invited to celebrate Ynah&apos;s 2nd birthday. Her parents are good friends of Nanay and Tatay&apos;s, and she loves to include the orphans. It was such a blessing for them, and they were so excited! It was a Halloween-themed party. There were lots of candy and games for the kids. They even had some games for the &quot;not so young.&quot; Yes, that included me...I had to play one of the games, and I was super embarrassed! There were so many people there that I didn&apos;t know, and, of course, everyone&apos;s watching the American! The game was to use an eggplant on a string tied around your waist and hit a tomato across the room with the eggplant. I had a hard time accomplishing that! But, we all got a good laugh out of it!

 On the way home from the birthday, I rode on top of the car! Yes, I know not the safest thing to do, but that&apos;s what the kids that don&apos;t fit inside have to do. I wanted to see what it was like. It was late at night so there was no traffic, which makes it a little safer. It was actually really fun. I just looked at the stars the whole way home. I&apos;m sure it wouldn&apos;t have been fun if we had to slam on the brakes, but I wanted to experience what some of the kids had to do. Though I say it was fun the one time I did it--it was tough, holding on over every bump. They even have to ride on the top in the rain, which I have seen them experience. I can&apos;t imagine that would be fun. This month all of that will change. The orphanage is finally getting another car to fit all of the kids inside. They have been saving and raising funds, and God&apos;s timing is here! They are so excited and will be much safer!
