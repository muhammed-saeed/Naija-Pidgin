 The Martha Stewart Show, February Winter 2007 
 Yield Serves 12

Ingredients
 
 Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 2 large eggs 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Pinch of cayenne pepper 4 large boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 2 pounds), cut into 1-inch cubes 1 cup apricot jam or preserves 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 
 
Directions
 
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and fit with a wire rack. Spray with cooking spray; set aside. Place flour in a large bowl and season very generously with salt and pepper. Whisk eggs in another large bowl with 2 tablespoons water until well combined. Place the breadcrumbs in a third large bowl, and drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Stir in cheese and cayenne and mix well. Place chicken pieces in the seasoned flour and toss to coat. Working in 3 batches, shake off any excess flour from chicken pieces and transfer to egg mixture; stir to combine. Transfer coated chicken pieces with a slotted spoon to the breadcrumb mixture and toss until completely coated. Place the breaded chicken pieces on a rack-lined baking sheet, spacing them evenly apart. Repeat process until all the chicken is breaded. Bake until golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes. In a small bowl, stir the apricot jam, mustard, and thyme together until combined. Allow chicken to cool 10 minutes before serving with apricot mustard mixture.

Easy to make and very very yummy! I made it for a babyshower. I can&apos;t wait to make it again!!

This is a fantastic chicken recipe! My family can relate to this recipe being for the&quot;the good chicken nuggets&quot;too. The sauce is deliciously sweet and tangy as Pink_bird said.

Martha and Team, This is by far the BEST chicken nugget recipe I have ever tasted. I only added garlic powder. It was so easy to prep and absolutely delicious, light and fun to make. Lovely for appetizers or entree portion. I can totally see why one other rater stated that her child asks her to make&quot;the good chicken nuggets&quot;because these are fantastic.

Sweet and tangy are two words to describe. This was an all time hit at the superbowl party! My husbands first reaction to hearing what it was before tasted it was sheer horror but he trusted my cooking instincts and allowed me to do it. I have been asked to make this everytime there is an event. I put cute toothpicks in it for easy handling and to pass around. I would recomend this to anyone!

Crunchy, tender, and delicious chicken with wonderful dipping sauce. Made it for a New Year&apos;s Eve party and it was a huge hit.

I prepared the Panko-crusted chicken for a New Years party, did not change much except I added hot sauce to spice it up

My 5-year old son who is a picky eater loved this! He calls them&quot;the good chicken nuggets&quot;and requests this dish frequently. This is a great healthy alternative to fast-food restaurant versions and packs well in lunches.

I had some chicken and just bought some panko and wanted to use them. Saw this recipe and it was fabulous. Even my husband who thought sauce sounded to sweet was delicious. I will make this alot now. He and I both loved it.

This recipe is perfect! It has been a huge hit at several parties...everyone loves it. You can prepare the chicken the night before and refrigerate it until you are ready to bake it. I stored it in a disposable tin with wax paper between the layers.

THIS IS GOOD, EXCEPT I MADE MY OWN BREAD CRUMBS.
