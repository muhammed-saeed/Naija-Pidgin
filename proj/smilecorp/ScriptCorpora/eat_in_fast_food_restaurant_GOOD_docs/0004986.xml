 40-210 POWERS GRANTED BY LAW. 

 A. The Board of Adjustment shall have such
powers as are granted by law to do the following:

 1. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision or refusal made by an administrative official or agency based on or
made in the enforcement of Part 3, Zoning, of this chapter.

 2. To hear and decide requests for
interpretation of the Zoning Map or Part 3, Zoning, of this chapter or for
decisions upon other special questions upon which such Board is authorized by
this chapter to pass.

 3. Where, by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property or by reason
of exceptional topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property or by reason of an extraordinary and exceptional
situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of property or the structures
lawfully existing thereon, the strict application of any regulation pursuant to
Part 3, Zoning, of this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the
developer of such property, to grant, upon an application or an appeal relating
to such property, a variance from such strict application of such regulation so
as to relieve such difficulties or hardship; where, in an application or appeal
relating to a specific piece of property, the purposes of this chapter would be
advanced by a deviation from the requirements of Part 3, Zoning, of this
chapter, and the benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any
detriment, to grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to
Part 3, Zoning, of this chapter; provided however, that no variance from those
departures enumerated in subsection A,4 of this section shall be granted under
this subsection; and provided, further, that the proposed development does not
require approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision, site plan or
conditional use in conjunction with which the Planning Board has power to
review a request for a variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60a.

 4. In particular cases and for special reasons,
to grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to Part 3,
Zoning, of this chapter to permit a use or principal structure in a district
restricted against such use or principal structure, an expansion of a
nonconforming use, deviation from a specification or standard pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional use, an increase in the
permitted floor-area ratio as defined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4, an increase in the
permitted density as defined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4 except as applied to the
required lot area for a lot or lots for detached one- and two-dwelling-unit
buildings, which lot or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or lots
resulting from a minor subdivision, but a variance under this subsection shall
be granted only by the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of the
Board.

 B. No
variance or other relief may be granted under the provisions of this section
unless such variance or other relief can be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and
purpose of the Zone Plan and Part 3, Zoning, of this chapter. Any application
under any subsection of this section may be referred to any appropriate person
or agency for his or its report, provided that such reference shall not extend
the period of time within which the Board of Adjustment shall act.

members required to grant any such subsequent approval shall be as otherwise
provided in this chapter for the approval in question, and the special vote

 40-311 DECISIONS. 

 A. Each decision on any application for
development shall include findings of fact and conclusions based thereon and

on the memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such members
present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption shall
be sufficient to adopt the resolution. An action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-9,
resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an application, shall be
memorialized by resolution as provided above, with those members voting against
the motion for approval being the members eligible to vote of the memorializing
resolution. The vote on any such resolution shall be deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment and not to be an action of the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment; however, the date of the adoption of the resolution shall
constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings, filings and
publications required by subsections h. and i . of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10. If the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment fails to adopt
a resolution or memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any
interested party may apply to the Superior Court of New Jersey in a summary
manner for an order compelling the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment to
reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and the
cost of the application, including attorneys&apos; fees, shall be assessed against
the Borough of Roselle Park.

 B. A member of the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment who was absent for one (1) or more of the meetings at which a
hearing was held shall be eligible to vote on the matter upon which the hearing
was conducted, notwithstanding his absence from one (1) or more of the
meetings; provided, however, that such member has available to him the
transcript or recording of all of the hearing from which he was absent and certifies
in writing to the Board that he has read such transcript or listened to such
recording.

 C. A
copy of the decision shall be mailed by the Board within ten (10) days of the
date of decision to the applicant or, if represented, then to his attorney, without
separate charge. A copy of the decision shall also be mailed to all persons who
have requested it and have paid the fee prescribed by the Board for such
service. A copy of the decision shall also be filed in the office of the
Borough Clerk, who shall make a copy of such filed decision available to any
interested party upon payment of a fee calculated in the same manner as those
established for copies of other public documents in the municipality and
available for public inspection at the Clerk&apos;s office during reasonable hours.

opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey

shall be required as a condition precedent for the filing of such plats with
the Union County Register&apos;s office. Approval of site plans by resolution of the

 40-704 FEES, DEPOSITS, GUARANTEES. 

 A. Escrow
Deposits. In addition to the initial fees or charges as elsewhere set
forth, the Planning Board and/or Board of Adjustment shall require escrow
deposits in accordance with the provisions of the fee and deposit schedule set
forth in Section 40-703. The Chief Financial Officer shall make all payments to
professionals for services rendered to the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment for review of applications for development, review and preparation
of documents, inspection of improvements or other purposes under the provisions
of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The application review and inspection charges
shall be limited only to professional charges for review and preparation of
documents and inspections of developments under construction and for review by
outside consultants, when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the
expertise of the professionals normally utilized by the Borough of Roselle
Park. The only cost that shall be added to any such charges shall be actual
out-of-pocket typical expenses incurred in processing applications and
inspecting improvements. No applicant shall be charged for any municipal,
clerical or administrative functions, overhead expenses, meeting room charges, or any of the municipal costs and expenses, except
as provided for specifically by statute, nor shall a municipal professional add
any such charge to his bill.

 B. Scope
of Reimbursed Services. The Borough of Roselle Park shall be entitled to be
reimbursed for the review of applications, both as to completeness and as to
content; for the review and preparation of documents such as, but not limited
to, drafting resolutions, developer&apos;s agreements, necessary correspondence with
applicant or applicant&apos;s professionals, and inspections.

 C. Deposit
of Escrow Funds; Refunds. Deposits received from any applicant in excess of
five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars shall be held by the Chief Financial Officer
in a special interest-bearing deposit account, and upon receipt of bills from
professionals and approval of the bills as hereinafter provided for, the Chief
Financial Officer may use such funds to pay the bills submitted by such professionals
or experts. The Borough shall not be required to refund an amount of interest
paid on a deposit which does not exceed one hundred ($100.00) dollars for the
year. If the amount of interest exceeds one hundred ($100.00) dollars, the
entire amount shall belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by the
Borough annually, or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied for the
purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may be, except that the
Borough may retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent to no more than
thirty-three and one-third (33 1/3%) percent of that entire amount, which shall
be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses. All sums not
actually so expended shall be refunded to the applicant within ninety (90) days
after the final decision by the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment with
respect to such application, upon certification by the Board Secretary that
such application has been finally decided.

 D. Payments. 

 1. Each payment charged to the deposit for
review of applications, review and preparation of documents and inspection of
improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from the professional, which
voucher shall identify the personnel performing the service, and each date the
services were performed, the hours spent to one-quarter (1/4) hour increments,
the hourly rate and the expense incurred.

 2. All professionals shall submit vouchers to
the Chief Financial Officer on a monthly basis in accordance with the schedules
and procedures established by the Chief Financial Officer. The professional
shall send an informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
Chief Financial Officer simultaneously to the applicant and the Planning Board
or Board of Adjustment for whom services were performed.

 E. Payments
Required Prior to Issuance of Permits. No zoning permits, building permits,
certificates of occupancy or any other types of permits may be issued with
respect to any approved application for development until all bills for
reimbursable services have been received by the Borough of Roselle Park from
professional rendering services in connection with such application and payment
has been made.

 F. Close-Out
Procedures. 

 1. The following close-out procedures shall
apply to all deposits and escrow accounts established under the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and shall commence after the Planning Board or Board
of Adjustment has granted final approval and signed the subdivision plat or
site plan in the case of application review escrows and deposits, or after the
improvements have been approved in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the
case of improvement inspection escrows and deposits.

 2. The applicant shall send written notice by
certified mail to the Chief Financial Officer and the Planning Board or Board
of Adjustment and to the relevant municipal professional that the application
or the improvements, as the case may be, are completed. After receipt of such
notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the Chief Financial
Officer of the Borough of Roselle Park within thirty (30) days and shall send a
copy simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial Officer shall render
a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to which the deposit
was put within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the final bill. Any balances
remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including interest in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 40:55D- 53.1, shall be refunded to the
developer along with the final accounting.

 G. Scope
of Charges. All professional charges for review of an application for
development, review and preparation of documents or inspection of improvements
shall be reasonable and necessary, given the status and progress of the
application or construction. Review fees shall be charged only in connection
with an application for development presently pending before the Planning Board
or Board of Adjustment, or upon review of compliance with the conditions of
approval, or review of requests for modification or amendment made by the
applicant. A professional shall not review items which are subject to approval
by any State governmental agency and not under municipal jurisdiction except to
the extent consultation with a State agency is necessary due to the effect of
State approvals on the subdivision or site plan.

 H. Limitation
of Inspection Fees. Inspection fees shall be charged only for actual work
shown on a subdivision or site plan or required by an approving resolution.
Professionals inspecting improvements under construction shall charge only for
inspections that are reasonably necessary to check the progress and quality of
work, and such inspections shall be reasonably based on the approved
development plans and documents.

 I. Substitution
of Professionals. If the Borough of Roselle Park retains a different
professional or consultant in the place of a professional originally
responsible for development application review, or inspection of improvements,
the Borough or the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall be responsible
for all time and expenses of the new professional to become familiar with the
application or the project, and the Borough or the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment shall not bill the applicant or charge to the deposit or the escrow
account for any such services.

 J. Estimate
of Cost of Improvements. The cost of the installation of improvements for
the purposes of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 shall be estimated by the Borough Engineer
based on documented construction costs for the public improvements prevailing
in the general area of the Borough of Roselle Park. The developer may appeal
the Borough Engineer&apos;s estimate to the County Construction Board of Appeals,
established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127.

 K. Appeals. 

 1. An applicant shall notify the Governing
Body in writing, with copies to the Chief Financial Officer, the Planning Board
or Board of Adjustment and the professional, whenever the applicant disputes
the charges made by a professional for a service rendered to the Borough in
reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of documents,
inspection of improvements, or other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.2. The Governing Body or its designee shall within a reasonable time
attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the matter is not resolved to the
satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may appeal to the County
Construction Board of Appeals, established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127, any
charge to an escrow account or deposit by any municipal professional or
consultant, or the cost of the installation of improvements estimated by the
Borough Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. An applicant or his
authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to the County Construction
Board of Appeals. The applicant or his
authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the Borough
or Roselle Park, the Planning Bard or Board of Adjustment, and any professional
whose charges are the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an appeal
within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the informational copy of the
professional&apos;s voucher required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c), except that if the
professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the
voucher, then the applicant shall file his appeal within sixty (60) days from
receipt of the Borough&apos;s statement of activity against the deposit or escrow
account required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c). An applicant may file an appeal
for an ongoing series of charges by a professional during a period not
exceeding six (6) months to demonstrate that they represent a pattern of
excessive or inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need
not appeal each charge individually.

 2. Appeals shall be taken in accordance with
the rules and procedures established by the County Construction Board of
Appeals.

 3. During
the pendency of any appeal, the Borough of Roselle Park, the Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment shall continue to process, hear and decide the application
for development and to inspect the development in the normal course and shall
not withhold, delay or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats
or site plans, the reduction or the release of performance or maintenance guarantees,
the issuance of construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other
approval or permit because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this
subsection. The Chief Financial Officer may pay charges out of the appropriate
escrow account or deposit for which an appeal has been filed. If a charge is
disallowed after payment, the Chief Financial Officer shall reimburse the
deposit or escrow account in the amount of any such disallowed charge or refund
the account to the applicant. If a charge is disallowed after payment to a
professional or consultant who is not an employee of the Borough of Roselle
Park, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the Borough in the amount
of any such disallowed charge.

prior to the regular meeting of the Planning Board, twelve (12) copies of the
sketch plat of the proposed subdivision for purposes of classification and
preliminary discussion by the members of the Planning Board and, if necessary,
by the members of the Planning Board and, if necessary, by the members of the
Planning Board and, if necessary, by the members of the Planning Board and the
applicant, applicant&apos;s agent or representative. Prior to consideration by the
Planning Board, copies of the sketch plat shall be forwarded by the Secretary
of the Planning Board to each of the following:

 3. Such other Borough, County or State officials,
as directed by the Planning Board: one (1) copy each.

 4. Members of the Planning Board: remaining

 B. All sketch plats submitted pursuant to this
section shall be accompanied by a properly completed application for sketch
plat review, as well as the appropriate fee set forth in Section 40-704. The
sketch plat shall be designed and drawn by a licensed New Jersey land surveyor
or professional engineer and shall be based on Tax Map information or some
other similarly accurate base at a scale of not less than fifty (50) feet to
the inch and shall comply with N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq., as amended, and
shall show or include the following information:

 1. The name of the professional engineer or
land surveyor who has drawn the sketch plat.

 2. The location of that portion which is to
be divided in relation to the entire street.

 3. All existing structures and wooded areas
within the portion to be subdivided and within two hundred (200) feet thereof.

 4. The name of the owner and of all adjoining
property owners as disclosed by the most recent Borough tax records.

 12. Sufficient elevations and contours at
five-foot intervals for slopes averaging ten (10%) percent or greater, and at
one-foot intervals with lands at lesser slopes to determine the general slope
and natural drainage of land and high and low points.

 C. The Planning Board shall waive notice and
public hearing for an application for development if the Subdivision Committee
of the Planning Board appointed by the Chairman finds that the application for
development conforms to the definition of&quot;minor subdivision&quot;in
Section 40-601 of Part 2 of this chapter. Minor subdivision approval shall be
deemed to be final approval of the subdivision by the Board, provided that the
Board or the Subdivision Committee may condition such approval on terms
ensuring the provision of improvements pursuant to Section 40-1301 of Part 2 of
this chapter.

 D. Minor subdivision approval shall be granted
or denied within forty-five (45) days of the date of submission of a complete
application to the Secretary of the Planning Board, or within such further time
as may be consented to by the applicant. For the
purposes of this section, a complete application for minor subdivision approval
shall consist of those items set forth in paragraph B. above. Failure of the
Planning Board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute minor
subdivision approval, and a certificate of the Secretary of the Planning Board
as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on request to
the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or
other evidence of approval as required herein, and shall be so accepted by the
County Recording Officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.

 E. If the plat is classified as a major
subdivision, a notation to that effect shall be made on the plat, which shall
be returned to the subdivider for compliance with the
procedures hereinafter set forth concerning applications for preliminary
approval of major subdivisions.

one hundred ninety (190) days from the date of municipal approval, unless
within such period a plat in conformity with such approval and the provisions
of the Map Filing Law, N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq., or a deed clearly describing
the approved minor subdivision is filed by the developer with the County
Recording Officer, the Municipal Engineer and Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such
plat or deed accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the Chairman
and Secretary of the Planning Board. In reviewing the application for
development for a proposed minor subdivision, the Planning Board may accept a
plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Law, provided that if the developer
chooses to file the minor subdivision as provided herein by plat rather than
deed, such plat shall conform to the provisions of the law.

 G. The
zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether conditional or
otherwise, upon which minor subdivision approval was granted shall not be
changed for a period of two (2) years after the date of minor subdivision
approval, provided that the approved
minor subdivision shall have been duly recorded as provided herein.

 Article IX Preliminary Approval of Site Plans and Major Subdivisions * 

   
 
 40-901 APPLICATION SUBMITTAL PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLANS. 

 A. The applicant shall submit to the Secretary
of the Planning Board a site plan and copies thereof and such other information
as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the
requirements necessary for preliminary site plan approval have been met, at
least three (3) weeks prior to the meeting of the Planning Board at which the
application is to be heard. The site plan and any engineering documents to be
submitted shall be required in tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary
approval. If any architectural plans are required to be submitted for site plan
approval, the preliminary plans and elevations shall be sufficient.

 B. Upon the submission to the administrative
officer of a complete application for a site plan which involves ten (10) acres
of land or less and ten (10) dwelling units or fewer, the Planning Board shall
grant or deny preliminary approval within forty-five (45) days of the date of
such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Upon submission of a complete application for a site plan which involves more
than ten (10) acres or more than ten (10) dwelling units, the Planning Board
shall grant or deny preliminary approval within ninety-five (95) days of the
date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by
the applicant.

 C. The applicant shall submit to the Secretary
of the Planning Board a subdivision application and copies thereof and such
other information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to
whether the requirements necessary for minor subdivision approval or
preliminary subdivision approval have been met, at least three (3) weeks prior
to the meeting of the Planning Board at which the application is to be heard.
The subdivision map and any engineering documents to be submitted shall be
required in tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval. If
any architectural plans are required to be submitted for subdivision approval,
the preliminary plans and elevations shall be sufficient.

 D. Upon the submission to the administrative
officer of a complete application for a subdivision of ten (10) lots or fewer,
other than a minor subdivision, the Planning Board shall grant or deny
preliminary approval within forty-five (45) days of the date of such submission
or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Upon
submission of a complete application for a subdivision of more than ten (10)
lots, the Planning Board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within
ninety-five (95) days of the date of such submission or within such further
time as may be consented to by the applicant.

 E. Failure on the part of the Planning Board to
reach a decision within the specified time period or extension thereof shall be
deemed to be a grant of preliminary approval of the subdivision and/or site
plan.

 F. The Planning Board may waive site plan
approval requirements if the construction or alteration or change of occupancy
or use does not effect existing circulation, drainage, relationships of
buildings to each other, landscaping, buffering, lighting and other
considerations of site plan review.

 G. If the Planning Board requires any
substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the applicant,
an amended application for development shall be submitted and proceeded upon,
as in the case of the original application for development.

 H. The
Planning Board shall, if the proposed development complies with this chapter
and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., grant preliminary site plan or subdivision
approval.

 (1980
Code 128-43; amended by Ord. No. 1348; Ord. No. 1354) 

   

   
 
 40-902 WAIVER OF HEARING FOR MINOR SITE PLANS. 

 The
Planning Board is authorized to waive notice and public hearing for an
application for development for site plan approval, if
the Planning Board or Site Plan Subcommittee of the Board, appointed by the
Chairman, finds that the application for development conforms to the definition
of&quot;minor site plan.&quot;Minor site plan approval shall be deemed to be
final approval of the site plan by the Board, provided that the Board or the
Subcommittee may condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of improvements pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-38, 40:55D-39, 40:55D-41 and 40:55D-53.

 A. Minor site plan approval shall be granted or
denied within forty-five (45) days of the date of submission of a complete
application to the administrative officer or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Planning
Board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute minor site plan
approval.

 B. Whenever review or approval of the
application by the County Planning Board is required pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:27-6.3 and 40:27-6.6, the Planning Board shall condition any approval that
it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the
County Planning Board or approval by the County Planning Board by its failure
to report thereon within the required time period.

 C. The
zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether conditional or
otherwise, upon which minor site plan approval was granted shall not be changed

 40- 1004 GUARANTIES . 

 A. Before recording of final subdivision plats
or as a condition of final site plan approval, the approving authority may
require and shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted by Part 2,
Land Subdivision and Site Plan Review, of this chapter for the purpose of
assuring the installation and maintenance of on-tract improvements:

 1. The furnishing of a performance guaranty
in favor of the Borough of Roselle Park in an amount not to exceed one hundred
twenty (120%) percent of the cost of installation for improvements it may deem
necessary or appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs,
sidewalks, streetlighting , shade trees, surveyor&apos;s
monuments, as shown on the final map and required by the Map Filing Law,
N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq., water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary
sewers, or other means of sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control
and sedimentation control devices, public improvements of open space and, in
the case of site plans only, other on-site improvements and landscaping,
provided that no more than ten (10%) percent of the total performance guaranty
shall be required to be in cash and the balance shall be in the form of a bond
from a bonding company approved by the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Roselle Park. The Borough Engineer shall review the improvements required by
the approving authority which are to be bonded and itemize their cost. The
itemization shall be the basis for determining the amount of performance
guaranty and maintenance guaranty required by the approving authority. The
Borough Engineer shall forward his estimate of the cost of improvements to the
applicant within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a request sent by
certified mail for the estimate.

 2. The furnishing of a maintenance guaranty
to be posted with the Mayor and Council for a period of not to exceed two (2)
years after final acceptance of the improvement in an amount not to exceed
fifteen (15%) percent of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other
governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities
to be installed or the improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance
guaranty to another governmental agency, no performance or maintenance
guaranty, as the case may be, shall be required for such utilities or
improvements.

 B. The time allowed for installation of the
improvements for which the performance guaranty has been provided may be
extended by the Governing Body by resolution. As a condition or as part of any
such extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased or
reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty
(120%) percent of the cost of the installation, as determined as of the time of
the passage of the resolution.

 C. If the required improvements are not
completed or corrected in accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor
and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable
cost of the improvements not completed or corrected, and the Borough may,
either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such
improvements.

 D. Upon substantial completion of all required
appurtenant utility improvements and the connection of same to the public
system, the obligor may notify the Governing Body in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Borough Clerk, of the completion or substantial
completion of improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. Thereupon, the Borough Engineer shall inspect all improvements of
which such notice has been given and shall file a detailed report, in writing,
with the Governing Body, indicating either approval, partial approval or
rejection of such improvements, with a statement of reasons for any rejection.
The cost of the improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.

 E. The Governing Body shall either approve, partially
approve or reject the improvements on the basis of the report of the Borough
Engineer and shall notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of the
contents of the report and the action of the approving authority with relation
thereto, not later than sixty-five (65) days after receipt of the notice from
the obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval is
granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure
provision of the improvements not yet approved, provided that thirty (30%)
percent of the amount of the performance guaranty posted may be retained to
insure completion of all improvements. Failure of the Governing Body to send or
provide such notification to the obligor within sixty-five (65) days shall be
deemed to constitute approval of the improvements, and the obligor and surety,
if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance
guaranty for such improvements.

 F. If any portion of the required improvements
is rejected, the approving authority may require the obligor to complete such
improvements and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set
forth in this section shall be followed.

 G. The obligor shall reimburse the Borough for
all reasonable inspection fees paid to the Borough Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of improvements, provided that the Borough may require of the
developer a deposit for all or a portion of the reasonably anticipated fees to
be paid to the Borough Engineer for such inspection.

 H. In
the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, the provisions of this section shall be applied by stage
or section.

Code 128-52; amended by Ord. No. 1348)

   

   
 
 40- 1005 FILING OF SUBDIVISION PLATS; EXPIRATION; SIGNATURES REQUIRED. 

 A. Final approval of a major subdivision shall
expire ninety-five (95) days from the date of signing of the plat, unless
within such period the plat shall have been duly filed by the developer with
the County Recording Officer. The approving authority may for good cause shown
extend the period for recording for an additional period of not to exceed one
hundred ninety (190) days from the date of signing of the plat.

 B. Final
approval of a major subdivision shall be evidenced by affixing to the plat the
signature of the Chairman and Secretary of the approving authority or a copy of
the certificate of the Secretary of the approving authority indicating that the
approving authority failed to reach a decision on the subdivision application
within the prescribed time. The signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the

approval, as owner or agent any land which forms a part of a subdivision for
which Borough approval is required by Part 2 of this chapter, such person shall
be subject to a penalty of not to exceed one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars, and

 Article XIV Flood Damage Prevention 

   
 
 40- 1401 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES. 

 A. Statutory
Authorization. The Legislature of
the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and
Council of the Borough of Roselle Park of New Jersey does enact this Article.

 B. Findings
of Fact. 

 1. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of
Roselle Park are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.

 2. These flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which
increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

 C. Statement
of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

 1. To protect human life and health;

 2. To minimize expenditure of public money
for costly flood control projects;

 3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief
efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;

 4. To minimize prolonged business
interruptions;

 5. To minimize damage to public facilities
and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets, bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

 6. To help maintain a stable tax base by
providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard
so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

 7. To insure the potential buyers are
notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

 8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas
of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

 D. Methods
of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Article
includes methods and provisions for:

 1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are
dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
which results in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or
velocities;

 2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods
including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage
at the time of initial construction;

 3. Controlling the alteration of natural
flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help
accommodate or channel flood waters;

 4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging,
and other development which may increase flood damage; and,

 5. Preventing
or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

 2. Conditions for Variances.

 a. Generally, variances may be issued for
new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of
one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 1
to 11 in Section 40-1404D,1d. have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical jurisdiction required for issuing the variance increases.

 b. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure&apos;s continued designation
as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.

 c. Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.

 d. Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.

 e. Variances shall only be issued upon:

 (1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

 (2) A determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,

 (3) A determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or
victimization of the public as identified in Section 40-1404D,1d.

 f. Any
applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the
base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:

 1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

 2. If Section 40-1405C ,1 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements must comply
with Section 40-1405, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.

 3. In
all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data has been
provided and no floodway has been designated, the cumulative effect of any
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than two-tenths (0.2) of a foot at any point.
