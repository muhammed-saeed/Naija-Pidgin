Fitday – My Personal Review of This Online Weight Loss Tool


 

 

 Fitday identifies itself as a “Free Diet&amp;Weight Loss Journal.” There are also versions that you can pay for to get additional tools.

At the time of writing this, their premium membership program costs $5.49 per month for a one-year membership.

It promises there will be:


 No advertising Custom tracking of any statistic that is important to you Access to advanced reports The ability to synch your PC application with your online account


The PC software costs $19.95, at the time of this writing, and allows you to use FitDay from your own computer without logging onto the Internet and offers more reports than the basic, free version.


The Basic Program


You can do a lot with the free program. It provides the following:


 A food journal for entering in the foods you eat every day.
 An activity journal for entering in your daily activities and shows you how many calories you burned.
 A place where you can enter your daily moods , and then correlate how you felt with what you ate or how much you ate.
 A food entry page. Here you can look up various foods and get the nutrients. It includes prepared meals that you can buy at the grocery store. It’s aimed at the person who consumes the standard American diet, rather than someone who may buy the occasional Amy’s frozen dinner at the health food store.
 Lots of different reports : Calories Eaten, Total Nutrition, Nutrition as a Percent of RDA, Nutrition as a Percent of Daily Value (DV), Nutrition Budget, Weight Change, Weight Goal Graph, Calories Eaten vs. Calories Burned, Calories Burned Pie Chart, Average Distance for an Activity, Nutrition by Mood, and more.



My Experience and Opinion


I spent several hours one day on my food journal. One food I entered was rye bread. When I typed it in, I was given several choices: large slice, small slice, thin slice, and snack size. However, I wasn’t able to see the ingredients of “rye bread” itself, which would be important in determining nutrient values.

When it came to entering in a recipe that I had created, things got challenging. I wanted to get the nutritional breakdown for a recipe for green beans and onions, with a few other ingredients. I had to look up each ingredient, the correct amount, and then enter individually each nutrient for each ingredient. For instance, I needed to know how much calcium and all the other nutrients are in 1 cup of green beans, 1/2 cup of onions, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of oregano, etc. It took a very long time, and I eventually gave up and didn&apos;t complete my day&apos;s entries.

My opinion is that Fitday is a great program for those who don’t want to spend any money on an online weight management program and who eat a fairly simple diet . It would be excellent for raw foodists who don’t make a lot of recipes. Or for those who follow the Standard American Diet (SAD). There are plenty of fast-food restaurant foods listed.
