ING Miami Marathon and Half-Marathon: Carbo Load Specials For Runners

 Active.com If you&apos;re running on Sunday, you&apos;re gonna need some pasta on Saturday. 
​ The ING Miami Marathon and Half-Marathon is this Sunday. Nearly 25,000 runners are expected to run the races, which start at the American Airlines Arena at 6:15 a.m.

The event brings runners from all over the world to Miami, filling up hotel rooms and restuarants. According to the ING Miami Marathon&apos;s official website , the 2011 event has 21,147 registered runners from 79 countries and all 50 states.

Unfortunately, race directors haven&apos;t arranged an official evening pasta party for the event (there is, however, an afternoon buffet lunch cruise on January 28 at noon for $50 per person). 

That means if you&apos;re running on Sunday morning, you&apos;re going to have to find a place to carbo load on your own. In a way, that&apos;s a good thing because we&apos;ve found some Miami restaurants offering marathon specials. Enjoy a steaming, hot bowl of pasta and fill up with stores of energy for the 13.1 or 26.2 mile journey through Miami and Miami Beach&apos;s most beautiful neighborhoods. See you on the course!
 
 Scarpetta 
Celebrity chef Scott Conant is offering a specially-designed menu for marathoners at his Scarpetta at Fontainebleau . The three-course Carb-Up dinner is being offered Friday, January 27 through Sunday, January 29 from 6 to 7 p.m. only. The best part? Scarpetta&apos;s famous spaghetti is offered as a choice, as is a decadent duck and foie gras ravioli. The dinner is $35 per person, not inclusive of tax and gratuity and reservations are required.

 Spris 
 Spris on Lincoln Road is offering three special pizzas as part of their Beat The Clock Promotion. Runners who order one of the three featured pizzas between 5 to 7 p.m. will be charged the same as the time they order (for example, order your pizza at 5:15 p.m., the cost is $5.15). Runners can choose from a Margherita pizza, Diavola pizza, or Genovese pizza. In addition, runners will receive a free &quot;lucky charm.&quot;

 Tiramesu 
 Tiramesu , also on Lincoln Road, is having a similar Beat The Clock special. From 5 to 7 p.m., runners who order one of three special pastas will be charged the same price as the time they order their meal (order your pasta at 6:30 p.m., pay $6.30). Choose from rigatoni pomodoro e basilico, linguini alla carbonara, or rigatoni a&apos;metriciana. Runners get a &quot;lucky charm&apos; here, too!
