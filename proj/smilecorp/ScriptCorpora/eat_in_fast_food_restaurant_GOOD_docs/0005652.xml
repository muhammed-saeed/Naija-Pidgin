 kurobuta curry 09 January, 2011 The place is sort of semi self-service joint where you place your order at the counter, make payment and get a number. The food is then delivered to you when it is ready. Specializing in tonkatsu, there are many permutations. Ebi fry, kaki fry, chicken and pork katsu, pork with cheese etc.

The meals are usually served with miso soup. The rice here is soft and sticky but not mushy. Curry is quite thick and flavorful but it could do with more vegetables in it. The deep fried kurobuta pork was not great. In fact, it doesn&apos;t seem to have any edge over normal pork. The meat was not as moist and tender as expected, and I encountered one piece that was rather chewy with tendons. Eating tonkatsu could get quite jelak after a while, so it would be nicer if the place has mustard sauce to give it some kick. One thing it has, is chili powder. It is spicy enough but won&apos;t make you choke. Good to add on any rice if you like a little more heat. Miso soup here has a smoky flavor, and has thin slices of pork in it.

 Unbelievably tasty pork katsu! 29 October, 2010 Ginza Bairin is an old name from Tokyo and their No. 1 Special Katsu Don is well... Number 1! or as judged by the fans on a TV show. I hated dining at ION but i&apos;m intrigued.. is the katsu don really that sensational? does the bowl of piggy goodness really lives up to its name? Let&apos;s find out!

It&apos;s weird how the ordering and siting areas are separated hence resulting in many patrons looking quite silly stumbling into the restaurant only to get out to order and return again...A word of advise so u don&apos;t look like goondus like us... do not walk into the seating area juz yet.. act nonchalant while u walk on n search for the small counter next to the sitting area.. order your food there and then coolly strut into the seating area..

We had the No 1. Katsu Don which looks totally tantalizing with an egg atop.... I&apos;m a sucker for any oozing egg yolk so this totally got me excited! The egg sits on top of a bed of fat fried breaded pork pieces and pretty white grains of rice...and when i broke the egg yolk and it flows over the katsu? hmmm yummmm...

The star of the dish is fittingly the pork pieces which is oh-so-tasty!... I was absolutely surprised by the flavor of the pork which is unbelievably yummy n addictive! The meat itself is tender and juicy while the seasonings is just perfect for the savory child in you! On the other hand, i though that the rice is less than stellar.. It&apos;s not pearly enough and tasted plain and flat... 

Overall i was quite in love with the katsu as i tot the pork is wondrously tasty and addictive! It&apos;s quite different from the other pork katsu don i had tried as the main flavor comes from the pork itself while in other dons it usually lies in e sauce so that&apos;s interesting to me.. Definitely one of the most tasty pork katsu i&apos;ve ever tasted!

However i still prefer Saboten&apos;s version which is heavenly! Comparatively Ginza&apos;s katsu is definitely tasty and Saboten&apos;s pretty decent as well but Saboten wins hands down with their pearly white rice and when it comes to eggs? i think Saboten&apos;s smarter with a poached egg than Ginza&apos;s slightly fried egg..Saboten has the whole package but then Ginza is more economical...

The katsu don&apos;s pretty encouraging so i might be back for the curry katsu!

 Must tries: no 1 katsu don I also recommend this place for:

 A re-visit! 25 October, 2010 

 

Second visit to Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin. Read our first visit here . Short post here. We had the tonkatsu ramen and again the katsu curry. Both were decent.

The soup base was nice and thick and the egg still warm and with a nice runny yolk. The chasu may not be as good as the other ramen specialty stalls that we have had, but still of a decent standard. 

 

As good as we last remembered it to be. The tonkatsu curry is a delight here. Good for a quick meal and short waiting time as the eatery is rarely over crowded.

 Previous Review(1) Yay to Japanese Pork Cutlet! 17 February, 2010 So, the missus and I are attending language lessons and it gave us the opportunity to eat out. Something which albeit all these entries, we do not too frequently. So it&apos;s a good &apos;us&apos; time. Read Full Review

 Should have just had a burger! 22 October, 2010 Was so hungry during one lunch and I wanted something so I went for a Okyako-don while my friend had the Unigi-Don. We both had 2 deep friend scallops each with a coke and coke-light.

I must say portion wise it&apos;s generous as there&apos;s plenty of chicken but I find it rather lack of taste and dry. My friend says her Unagi wasn&apos;t too bad, perhaps she had a more flavorsome choice.

The scallops were at least the saving grace at the end of the day but then again when main course fails to deliver I will not bother again.

 Delicious Special Katsu Don, Katsu Curry 25 June, 2010 My girlfriends and I decided to give Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin a try. We wondered why the dining place is so quiet during lunch hour, less than 10 customers I think. We went through the menu and ordered Special Katsu Don, Katsu Curry, and 2 other dishes (forgot the name). To our delight, the Special Katsu Don and Katsu Curry are delicious. My friends laughed at me when I kept nodding my head while I was eating. The portion was just nice enough to fill our hungry stomach!

 worst dessert that i ever tried 18 April, 2010 I went around 8pm ++

as i walked pass,saw the picture of the katsu seem nice so decided to give it a try

was a bit surprised that need to pay first before eat,wanted to try the special don but seem like just a normal don ,without any miso soup ,so shall give it a miss&amp;tried katsu curry set&amp;dessert,while my friend tried some pork with cheese on it

Is a treat from my friend,as she does not bring much cash,so she wanna pay by nets,but the cashier told her only cash&amp;credit card payment,no nets=.=

isn&apos;t nets also money?why can&apos;t accept?

we waited around 15-20mins for the food

curry not bad,unlike other resturant,japanese curry is sweet but will still have about 5-10% spicy but this is 100% sweet ,

katsu chicken,the skin is very crispy but chicken meat taste so so,a bit tasteless actually

i can&apos;t really remember what was added in the miso soup but it taste difference from other miso soup&amp;it doesn&apos;t taste nice,a bit weird,

i tried the pork cheese,it&apos;s just like a normal pork with cheese on it,nothing special,

The worst was the dessert,really cannot make it

mochi not chewy,there&apos;s soya powder on the mochi,is too dry,doesn&apos;t stick on it well,

overall i should be won&apos;t go back again.waste money

 Improved a lot! 02 April, 2010 I did hear a lot of bad reviews of this place when it first opened, but I was still curious enough to try it recently (Mar 2010). To my delight, it was actually not as bad as people told me. It is styled more like a fast food restaurant rather than a proper sit-down restaurant, although food is not prepared as fast as McDonald&apos;s. But in both times I&apos;ve been there, I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food to come.

So far I&apos;ve tried both the curry katsu rice and the pork katsu rosu rice. The meat is a bit tough, but the batter is really nice! I also like their tonkatsu sauce, as it has its own unique taste than the usual &quot;Bulldog&quot; sauce you get in other restaurants.

The soup that comes with the set is tonjiru, which is a homemade-style pork soup. Too bad they don&apos;t have the normal miso soup for non pork-eaters.

Didn&apos;t experience any bad service whatsoever. The staff was pretty much all business-like - I guess the attitude is really like a fast food restaurant. Must tries: tonkatsu I also recommend this place for:

 Ramen good, drink bad 25 February, 2010 I had my lunch session on 17 Feb 2010 around 1247 hrs. Below is my review.

Arrived at the place and wanted to go inside to have a seat, immediately halt by a waitress informing me to order just outside, beside the entrance. Different type of concept but acceptable. The place can accommodate about 30 plus people I suppose. Wooden chairs and table presentation, open space, bright and lively.

I ordered a char siew ramen at $13.83 and a ice lemon tea at $1.96. Total after GST was $16.90, before I decided to eat here, I saw a signage saying no service charge. If there is, no way I am going in I tell you. First talk about the drink, at $1.96, I can get a better drink elsewhere, but no choice, needed a cold drink to sooth my throat from the hot food. My order took about 10 minutes to arrive. The ramen had about 5 to 6 pieces of char siew, not the usual soft meat I had before elsewhere, but the pork was well marinated, hard but personally prefer the soft &quot;glide down your throat&quot; type. The noodle was pretty chewy. The soup base was nice, not the most outstanding I had so far, but definitely better than some I had at elsewhere. Also had one whole egg inside, but not too bad, but had better elsewhere.

Value wise, at $16.90 at ION orchard is pretty acceptable for me, but the drink is not worth it. Luckily don&apos;t have service charge, if not, don&apos;t count on me coming back here again.

Service was pretty good. When the waitress stopped me, she was very polite. The concept is different from other places. Order your food and drink at a counter, pay for the food and drink, carry a number tag and your drink and sit anywhere you like.

 Must tries: this place is so called famous for pork, what else man. I also recommend this place for:

 Passable! 14 February, 2010 My first reaction to the 3.2 overall rating was: Why so bad? Afterall, my dining experience there was still acceptable. Allow me to justify myself:

My mate got the signature Special Katsu Don (Pork). Its billboards claim to be the best in Japan... I&apos;m not sure how true that is, but hmmmn. The egg was still runny when it was served to us... Just exciting visually! The rice had a drizzle of sweet seasoning. Overall it was a very appetising dish. My gripes though, were that the pork was a little too hard to chew nicely. And the rice was a little too mushy!

I had a mixed Curry Fry Set (?). Upsized! It came with 2 pieces of chicken karaage, 1 prawn, and 1 pork cutlet. The fried items were light and crispy, void of the heavy greasy feeling. However, the curry was quite disappointing. Sweet, thick, but not as fragrant as I would have liked it to be. In fact it did feel as mediocre as the curry mixes you can get from the supermarket (like the other reviewers have commented).

Well, I did enjoy the little side dishes. The pickles are good to perk up the stomach in the middle of a heavy meal like this. The pork and turnip soup (I suppose I didn&apos;t get to taste the miso soup?) was sweet, flavourful and had a home-cooked touch.

There is no service charge here so I guess I can&apos;t say much, but the food is served piping hot and fast, so that&apos;s a bonus. The decor of the restaurant is plain and nondescript, just like a typical no-frills fast food restaurant. And ouch it is also really small and cramped! At more than $20 per person, this might not be the most &quot;value for money&quot; Japanese meal you can get in town, though it will certainly satisfy your cravings... Try this if you want to get a decent Katsu Don (:

 Don&apos;t be fooled! 12 October, 2009 It was just a slow Saturday when my boyfriend and I scoured around for [nice] food.

So we decided to give Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin a try. After all, it was a packed eatery when we last saw it.

Ordered a Curry Katsu [140g] rice upsized set [cost an extra $1.50] and a green tea. With the GST, the total bill came up to $19.90.

It was fortunate that I decided to share a set with my bf.

The green tea tasted like green mouldy water from an abandoned fish tank without the flavour of mould. After stirring.

The food came hot and fresh. A plus point. There wasn&apos;t a long wait. But the curry reminded me of those instant ones that I can easily buy off the supermarket racks. Minus the fragrance and intensity of curry flavour.

The fried pork pieces were nicely fried. But the meat was tasteless. Maybe you should try it with the curry, my bf said. We ended up concluding that with or without curry, the meat&apos;s still tasteless.

I was impressed with the miso soup, because I saw ingredients in it. Not authentic Japanese miso, maybe, but I was still trying to enjoy my meal. But the miso soup didn&apos;t taste strongly of miso. It tasted like a bit of miso with lots of chicken stock. Why save on the miso!?!?!

After this meal I actually missed the curry set from Sho***o at Raffles City Shopping Centre. Good heavens.

All in all. Don&apos;t be fooled. I&apos;d give this place a year or so. Must tries: Ignoring this place
