Sonic: America&apos;s Drive- In The fast-food industry
is changing everyday. There are new products being
introduced in the market and new slogans being
created. The companies in the fast-food industry
will do their best to make the greater burger, and
to make bigger and better fries. Founded in 1953,
Sonic has become the largest drive-in chain in the
nation. Sonic was founded by Troy Smith, Jr.

in
Shawnee, Oklahoma. His dream was to own his own
business. Sonic Drive-In keeps the 1950s alive
through its chain of drive-in restaurants, each
complete with speaker-based ordering systems and
carhop servers - some on roller skates. Sonics top
competitors are McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, and
Wendy&apos;s. McDonald&apos;s is the leading competitor in
the fast-food industry

McDonald&apos;s has the most
restaurants with 12,380 locations and has over
364,000 employees. Burger King has 11,350 outlets
in 57 countries and territories worldwide. About
75% is located in the United States. Wendy&apos;s is
the third largest quick-service hamburger
restaurant chain in the world, with more than
6,600 restaurants in North America and
international markets. In Exhibit 1, this states
the Porters Five Forces Model of Competition of
The Restaurant Industry.

Threat of new entrants:
Because the profit margins are so small, cost is
low and anyone can enter into the quick-service
restaurant business. Bargaining Power of Buyers:
The National Restaurant Association showed that
three out of ten customers agreed that food that
was prepared at a restaurant or a fast-food
restaurant were an important factor in their
everyday lives. The survey also stated that &quot;three
out of five customers plan to eat on the premises
of quick-service restaurants and seven out of ten
said that plan to eat takeout or delivery. (Hitt,
Ireland,&amp;Hoskisson, pg. 367)Customers buy when
they feel it is necessary giving them the upper
hand on the industry.

Bargaining power of
suppliers: In the quick- service restaurant, the
suppliers vary. They really do not rely
distributors as large restaurants do. Threat of
new substitutes: The restaurant industry is
segmented into many parts: full service
restaurants ($120 billion); quick- service
restaurants ($110 billion); away-from-home managed
institutions, examples: food services for schools
and hospitals ($21 billion); and other food
industries ($106 billion). (Marshall Jones, 1999).
Rivalry among competition firms in the industry:
Competition in the restaurant industry is strong.
There are about 8 million restaurants in the world
and 300,000 are restaurant companies.Exhibit 2.
Swot Analysis of Sonic: America&apos;s Drive-in
Opportunities: Strengths: Sonics financial
performance has had a great growth in the economy.
From 1992-2001, net sales increased annually by
27%,19%,25%,22%,21%,20%,17%,8%,and 18%. And on
March 22, 2003, Sonic reported net income of $12.6
billion and revenue increased by 19%.

Another
opportunity is Sonic is very product
differentiated. Sonic is known for its unique
made-to-order menu items. Sonic continues to
support menu innovations, such as its breakfast
menu, Sonic Summer Nights, toaster sandwiches,
extra-long cheese coneys, and frozen and fountain
favorites. Hamburgers are made to order and served
in aluminum foil, preserving the heat and drinks
are served in Styrofoam cups to preserve the cold.
Opportunities: Weakness: Human resources: There is
a low employee rate because of the high turnover.
The restaurant industry tends employ more retirees
than the younger generation. However, the industry
could strengthen this weakness, by making the
companies more attractive to the younger
generation.

Threats: Strengths: Sonic is operating
in a fast-food industry that is dominated by large
competitors, but through it all Sonic stays on top
as the nations largest drive- in chain. Threats:
Weakness: The rising popularity of dieting could
be real threat to Sonic. Sonics competitors have
low-carb menus and Sonic does not carry it on its
product differentiated menu. McDonald&apos;sEconomic:
Food quality is the key focus of McDonalds. How
the customer view the quality of their products is
important.Political: McDonald&apos;s is very selective
about the choice franchisees and requires that all
franchisees be active participants in the
management of the restaurants.Demographic: Growth
strategy focuses on the opening of profitable
restaurants and expanding its
operations.Sociocultural: Appeals to children, has
the mighty kids meal, Disney tie-ins, play areas
and Ronald McDonald: who is one of the trademark
of McDonald&apos;s.

Created a great name that
associated with friendly, child loving
atmosphere.Technological: Big on Advertisement.
Slogan &quot;I&apos;m lovin it&quot; Global: Public Awareness
Campaigning Worldwide Balanced, Active
lifestylesBurger King:Economic: September of 2002,
Burger King introduced the 99-cent menu.Political:
Franchise owner is required to attend minimum of
700 hours of classroom and restaurant training
before given a franchise contract.Sociocultural:
Comedian Steve Harvey was the company&apos;s spokes
person in 2002. Had Halloween tie-in with the
Simpson&apos;s. Burger King is also the only that
introduced and have a vegetarian
menu.Technological: Advertising: The subservient
chicken: a current viral marketing
promotion.Wendy&apos;sEconomic: Wendy does not supply
food products to franchisees directly; it has a
corporate arrangement with independent
distributors. Demographic: Plans to expand in
profitable areas.Sociocultural: The Company and
its franchisees operate and own Tim Horton&apos;s,
Caf&apos;e Express, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, and Pasta
Pomodoro.Sonic: America&apos;s Drive-inEconomic:
Committed to providing not only the freshest
unique flavors and food for their customers, but
superior service.Technological: System wide
information system, SEI Information technology:
provide software and hardware technical support
for the new portal as well as training for Sonic
employees and franchisees. PartnerNet portal:
provides Sonic operators with centralized access
to a broad range of communication tools, sales
data reporting features and etc.

Mirapoint: a
provider of Internet messaging systems, worked
with Sonic Drive-ins to develop a Sonic-branded,
web-based e-mail and calendaring solution for the
portal.Sociocultural: Sonic has the wacky pack for
the kids; children receive a learning activity and
free toy. Sonic provides season-based or generic
toys instead of toys with movie or television
tie-ins.Demographic: Brand building is an
important asset to Sonic. After analyzing the
position of this company and the characteristics
of this industry, the key strategic issue facing
this firm is cost containment. Since competitors
continue to improve distribution models to gain a
cost advantage. An alternative that the industries
should look at would be to reduce cost.

Look at
ways of keeping the unique product differentiation
but find ways to reduce cost to stay ahead. There
is not a perfect solution in the industry. No one
can predict the economic because it is always
changing. Sonics specialty menu has allowed the
chain to differentiate. Through its increased
marketing efforts, Sonic will gain brand
recognition and increase its customer base.Works
