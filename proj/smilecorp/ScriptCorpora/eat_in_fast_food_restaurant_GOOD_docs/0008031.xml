It might be better named “Penal” for its half-dozen privately operated prisons that employ thousands. The ranks of the unemployed are swelled by families of inmates who move nearby. The county is also wooing Union Pacific to build a giant rail yard.

 Cleveland, Ohio 

 Unemployment: 6.9%

Governor John Kasich is a fracking fan and booster for gas drilling in the Utica Shale. Shell Oil is thinking of building a world-scale petrochem plant there, while Vallourec and ArcelorMittal have recently ramped up steelmaking.

 

 New Orleans, La. 

Unemployment: 6.5%

A cap-ex boom has followed in the wake of destruction left by Hurricane Katrina. Steel giant Nucor is building a new $3.4 billion furnace complex in St. James Parish that will eventually employ 1,000.

“canisters of high-level waste, 600 degrees hot”

Where on Earth did you get that number from? After five years in a water-filled pool, used LWR fuel can be put into a shielded canister cooled only by ambient air circulation.

“a reprocessing plant, which would take the 95% of energy still left in old rods and turn it into new ones.”

Not quite, unless Integral Fast Reactors (a project killed by Bill Clinton and John Kerry in 1994) are involved.

“tiny volumes of ultrabad waste that could be devastating in the wrong hands”

You mean for so-called “dirty bombs”? The explosives would harm people more than the radioactive contaminants. Anyway, the bad guys would get this from medical, sterilization, or radiography sources, not reprocessing plants.

“Science must be the decision maker.”

Yeah, but the media need to educate themselves enough to know how to report it properly.

As for the ultimate economic incentive, the people of Carlsbad should simply be allowed them to take title to the used LWR fuel.

In ten years, after the ideologically-driven push for unreliable and inefficient renewables has passed, and society realizes that the only way to curb emissions and supply a growing worldwide population is through the use of Generation IV nuclear reactors, this material will be seen not as waste, but as a ready-made stockpile of fuel capable of generating decades worth of electricity.

But first we have to educate the public, change the paradigm, and start calling things what they really are – a nearly inexhaustible fuel supply, rather than “nuclear waste”.

I think Carlsbad is an excellent choice for this stuff.

I used to work for an oil exploration company in the Permian basin that specialized in seismic surveys. Been all over this area.

It’s remote. It’s got a stable geology. And anybody who lives out in the middle of nowhere tend to be pretty tough people to begin with.
If this does have some long term effect we’ve overlooked, I believe the technology of the future will have some way to deal with it.

I’m not a big fan of nuclear energy for the fact the waste is so toxic. But at the same time, I don’t want to train guinea pigs to row a tiny little boat either.

It is much easier if you teach the little hamster coxswain to call “stroke” instead of “row”.

It is much easier to pronounce stroke with cheeks full of seeds than it is to say row.

Here’s what the United States Department of Energy is spending 40 percent of its $29 billion annual budget on:

http://viableopposition.blogspot.com/2011/04/united-states-department-of-energy.html

Rather than helping consumers improve energy efficiency and save money in this time of high energy costs, billions are being wasted baby-sitting America’s nuclear arsenal.

It’s not widely known that since 1995 highly enriched uranium from over 18,000 surplus Soviet warheads has been downblended into fuel for American power reactors, providing 10% of this country’s electricity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatons_to_Megawatts_Program

A MOX (Mixed Oxide) plant being constructed in South Carolina will do the same thing to 3.5 tons of plutonium warheads annually: http://www.moxproject.com

This is the best way to efficiently utilize, and destroy once and for all, aging Cold War bombs – a modern technological version of the biblical imperative to beat swords into plowshares.

Not exactly.

Enriching and reusing spent uranium fuel creates even more radioactive waste.

The more you feed the beast—-the more poop there is to clean up.

And the yard is getting pretty well piled up already.

This all sounds very good.

But there are some factors that are not being considered.

It is hard to speak about safety when there is no track record to base any kind of statistical predictions on. The safety aspect is still pretty much conjecture. The concern about trucking high level radioactive waste on public roads seems fully justified to me. Trucks can be pretty safe for moving things—trains even safer. However, we KNOW from experience, get enough trucks and trains on the move with hazardous loads, and sooner or later you WILL have accidents.

They transport nuclear waste in indestructible containers.

Here is another consideration that occurs to me.

A salt dome is considered a safe bet from a seismic and geologic point of view—and that is probably true.

However, what happens when you bury high level radioactive waste in a salt dome?

I don’t know, it has never been done before. And neither does anyone else. I do know that where there are large areas of land that were there have been nuclear accidents in the past where no one is allowed to live displacing large populations for as much as 30 years(so far) in both Ukraine and Japan. It is just too radioactive to be safe.

Are we setting things up to have just such a large exclusion zone in Carlsbad NM?(or somewhere else, due to a transport accident?)

I don’t know. Possibly.

Is it worth the risk just to make electricity to run hair dryers, X boxes, and leave refrigerator doors open? I don’t think so. I think we have better and much safer ways of doing the same thing.

In a nuclear accident radioactive particles contaminate the area, and they emit dangerous ionizing radiation for years or decades. In case of storage, only the radiation can escape from the containers, not the radioactive material itself, and radiation can be shielded easily.

aaaand it won’t last forever. the radioactive material decays with time

Since we are making “facts” out of the speculations based on assumptions that we have no experience or historical justification to establish as facts. I’d like to make a speculation as well.

This is pure speculation on my part. I have absolutely no history, experimental data, or previously done projects to base this speculation on—but considering that the pro-nuclear people are basing their safety claims on conjecture, I’d like to do just a little conjecture too.

So, what do I know about radioactive decay?

Radioactive decay produces heat. A LOT of heat. Enough heat that the solid iron core of the earth’s interior has been melted by the retained heat of the radioactive decay of the isotopes that were present when the earth was formed over 4 billion years ago. This heat and pressure, and liquid molten iron and rock still drives the earth’s tectonic plate movement today.

All of the power ever generated by all of the earthquakes, volcanoes, and continental drift of the entire lifetime of the earth has been generated by radioactive decay in the earths interior(and to a minor degree by magnetic induction—but mostly, radioactive decay).

It sends entire continents sliding around and colliding like billiard balls on a pool table.

Even the lowest level radioactive waste being proposed to be buried in New Mexico is thousands of times higher than the amount of radioactive decay taking place naturally inside the earth that creates these amounts of power.

Spent fuel rods such as in Japan had to have constant streams of water on them to remove heat otherwise they would melt the stainless steel casings(which melt at about 2500* F). Even 50-60 years after they have been placed in storage, When that does not happen—-you can have massive explosions.

You’ve seen the result of that many times on the photos and videos of Chernobyl and Fukushima.

And now—we are going to bring ALL of the results of ALL of our nuclear power generation and bomb making for the last 70 years together and dump them down one big hole?

It only seems reasonable to me to expect that there might be a HUGE problem with this.

Problems that the service station owners and fast food restaurant owners who are promoting the idea have very little or no comprehension of. They want to sell trucks diesel fuel and hamburgers.

The thermal conductivity of rock is very poor, and there is thousands of miles of it between the core and the surface, so the decay heat can’t escape.
The nuclear waste is close to the surface, and can be cooled by air too. Plus, most of the waste is only slightly radioactive. The spent fuel, which is the hottest stuff, is stored on site for a few years, until it’s cool down enough to be safe to store without active cooling.
