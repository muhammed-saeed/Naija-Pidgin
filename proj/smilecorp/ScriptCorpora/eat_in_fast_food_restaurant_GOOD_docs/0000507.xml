How to Use Flash Menu Builder Menu Generator

 
1) File menu

 


 New - to create new project.

 Open - to open saved project. You will be asked if you would like to save the current project in the menu buttons creator.

 Save - to save current project in the project file (*.xwb). When you save to project file, the directory &quot;ProjectName.xwb.icons&quot; is created, where ProjectName is the name of your project file. This directory contains button icons, .css and .js files of the saved menu.

 Save as… - to save current project in the project file (*.xwb) or in the HTML file or to save your project under another name. Choose type from the &quot;File type&quot; list in the &quot;Save as…&quot; dialog and enter project&apos;s (new) name. When you save to project file, the directory &quot;ProjectName.xwb.icons&quot; is created, where ProjectName is the name of your project file. This directory contains button icons, .css and .js files of the saved menu. If the menu doesn&apos;t have any icons then the directory is not created.

 Save as HTML - to save current project into the HTML file (*.html). Project HTML file will be saved then, and the directory created, containing buttons&apos; images. The directory name will be: &quot;YourProjectName-files&quot;, where YourProjectName is the name of the HTML file saved. For example: if you enter &quot;Header&quot; in the &quot;Name&quot; field of the &quot;Save as…&quot; dialog, then &quot;Header.html&quot; and directory named &quot;Header-files&quot; will be created.

 Exit - to close Vista Buttons application.



2) Tools

 Export images - to save menu buttons&apos; images as gif-files (*.gif), png-files (*.png) or jpg-files (*.jpg). &quot;Save As…&quot; dialog will appear, where you can either type each button name or leave it unchanged. If you want to save the button images, press &quot;Save&quot;. &quot;Save settings&quot; dialog will appear where you can choose image format. Either way (if you don&apos;t want the button images to be saved), press &quot;Cancel&quot;. This procedure will be repeated for all the menu buttons. When you press &quot;Save&quot;, 1 to 3 images are to be saved, depending on the menu type. Their names will be: ButtonName_0.gif - ButtonName_2.gif, where ButtonName is the name you have entered when saving.
 ButtonName_0 - corresponds to Normal state. ButtonName_1 - Hot state image. ButtonName_2 - corresponds to pressed/clicked state. 



 Theme editor - to edit/create new themes.

 Page insert - you can insert your menu into the existing HTML page.

3) Languages menu


 

The &quot;Languages&quot; menu contains the list of available interface languages. English is the default language setting.



4) Help menu


 

 Help - to read the help.
