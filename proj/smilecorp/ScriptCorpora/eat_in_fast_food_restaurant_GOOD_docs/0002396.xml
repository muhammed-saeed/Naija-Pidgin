Social Progress – I’m Lovin’ It!

in Green is Grand 
 
 Any time I find myself doubting that American society is capable of changing for the better, all I need to do is walk into a McDonald’s restaurant.  When I was a child, McDonald’s was a place that you dropped into when you had little money and needed to mindlessly scarf down a burger and fries while you were on your way somewhere or only had a fifteen minute gap in your schedule for a terrible, terrible meal.

At no point did McDonald’s become a particularly desirable destination for me, and it may be because I’ve been there so few times that I never adjusted to the changes it’s made to its menu, interior, and overall character.  I still find it disorienting when I find myself inside a corporate fast food restaurant ordering a cappuccino or a salad.  The gap between what I still expect to find underneath the golden arches and what’s actually there boggles my mind, but when I get to thinking about the source of my confusion, I find it very encouraging.

That’s not to say that there isn’t a lot of progress yet to be made, but considering that I didn’t notice society becoming so health conscious and sophisticated as to illicit such a drastic change in the McDonald’s menu, it’s nice to be able to see evidence of what’s happened when you can’t quite see what’s happening.  That is often the way of things.  Progress can seem very elusive in the moment, but when you’re looking at the way things are in the context of the way they used to be, it’s a much different perspective.

In another decade or two, hopefully we’ll be able to recognize the outcomes of more enlightened attitudes that are developing now towards the environment.  It will be the same as the more enlightened attitudes toward food that we know have developed, even if we don’t know exactly when or how.  Corporations like McDonald’s can be expected to create some of those outcomes in either case.  For the sake of their profits, they often do respond to the public will.

Toward that end, McDonald’s is finally beginning to respond to the pressures of an environmentally conscious consumer base by testing paper coffee cups that may come to replace the current polystyrene foam.  That is a change that’s long overdue, and thus eagerly welcome.  Presently, paper cups are only being test run at 2000 US locations, mostly on the West Coast, but assuming that the program takes off and is instituted throughout the corporation, it’s nice to know about the pilot program and be able to watch progress happening for a change, rather than just being surprised by it after the fact.

Again, there’s much to be done.  With the entire McDonald’s culture being changed to closely reflect that of a café, it wouldn’t be outrageous to expect the corporation to promote the use of ceramic cups in the future, to cut down not just on permanent landfill waste but all landfill waste.  It will be a long time until the public will or the corporate flexibility is sufficient for that, but the fact that the company is willing to make any changes at all right now gives me hope for what might be possible.

Perhaps in my lifetime McDonald’s will have transformed into one of the healthiest and greenest corporate entities in the world, where one minute meals include items like arugula and bamboo shoots , where everything that can be recycled is, and where even the employee uniforms are made out of viscose from bamboo fabric, in the interest of sustainability.  Paying employees a living wage may be a bit much to ask for during my lifetime, but at least they can be comfortable and dry while laboring between the deep fryer and the heat lamps.

Such a hypothetical may seem so absurdly implausible.  Call me insane if you wish, but if you had told me twelve years ago that in my mid-twenties I would be able to ask a McDonald’s cashier for a caramel latte and be met with anything other than a dead-eyed, but perplexed stare, I would have called you insane as well.  It’s easy to be cynical about our collective hopes for the future, but let’s all agree to be prepared to recognize that we were wrong once we look back and see that things have actually changed for the better.
