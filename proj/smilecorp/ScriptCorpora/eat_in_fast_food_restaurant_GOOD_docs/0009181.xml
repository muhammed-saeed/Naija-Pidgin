 Comments ( 1,672 comments ) Permalink Tweet Tipping points–on stiffing for poor service 
We asked, and boy, did readers serve up some boiling hot feedback! In a poll last Friday, we asked one simple question: Have you ever left a restaurant meal without tipping? 

At last count, here&apos;s how voters responded:
 
I sure have - the service was that bad 49% (22,139 votes)
I&apos;ve left a very low tip 29% (13,402 votes)
I would NEVER! Never even less than 15-20% 15% (6,803 votes)
I&apos;ve left a penny 5% (2,482 votes)
Other (tip us off in the comments) 2% (745 votes)
Total Votes: 45,571
 
And they didn&apos;t stop there. We&apos;ve collated a few of the over 1,200 passionately pro and anti goose-egg-leaving sentiments below, but first, a few facts.
 
- According to the Department of Labor&apos;s website , while some states don&apos;t specify a minimum wage lower than the one determined by the state, Federal and many state laws allow a minimum wage of $2.13 an hour and assume that tips will make up the shortfall. In West Virginia, it&apos;s $1.45.

- Restaurants are legally supposed to make up the shortfall between this minimum pay and minimum wage.

- Tips are taxable income as they&apos;re part of assumed wages.

- Many establishments practice tip pooling so that servers&apos;tips are also spread among busboys, runners and other service staff.

And on to the comments.

If you receive terrible service, not only should you not tip or tip very little, you should speak with the manager and let them KNOW why you are tipping thus. Otherwise, they won&apos;t know that your server was incompetent – they&apos;ll think you just forgot or were too cheap to tip.
 
 Larry 
If the service is bad enough to warrant no tip, I make sure that both the waiter and the manager know about it. I try to be very nice and understanding – I do understand that kitchen mistakes are NOT the waiter&apos;s fault, but leave me or my family sitting with empty drinks and fawn over a table that&apos;s on expense account and you&apos;ll get nothing but a complaint to the manager.
 
 Melissa 
You bet your butt I&apos;ve walked out without leaving a tip! The service was HORRIBLE. At one point my husband had to get up and walk around the place asking where our waiter was. ... I would have no problem doing it all over again. If I am provided with bad service, then I am not going to reward you for it.
 
 Jaliska 
Why do people assume that everyone is obligated to give tips?
Tips shouldn&apos;t even be expected unless a server demonstrates impeccable service and does extra things they aren&apos;t paid to do. This show of entitlement is a little obnoxious, to be honest.

They chose to work at that restaurant w/ minimum wage. They&apos;re not forced to live off that money. If they really wanted to, they could get a good-paying job somewhere else. It&apos;s not the customer&apos;s problem that the server doesn&apos;t earn enough money to fend for himself. We eat out to feed ourselves, not to worry about someone else.

How would you like to be&quot;punished&quot;at work by a complete stranger if you were having an off day? Most likely this was the cause behind your poor service. My other co-workers and I understand that if your experience is sub-par you&apos;re not going to come back, or tell anyone new to stop by. We work in a busy restaurant in New York City, and most of us are able to stop a problem or correct one before it even becomes close to ruining your night.

Sometimes, however, it&apos;s inevitable. And believe me, I feel as upset as you do when it happens because I take pride in doing my job well. So ,all I ask is next time you wield the mighty pen at tip time, give your server the benefit of the doubt if your experience was sub-par. Truth is: getting a serving job in a nice restaurant involves fierce competition. Truly nasty or incompetent servers are usually very quickly weeded out before they make it to a table.
 
 Nick 
To anyone who has ever left Zero Tip... Next time you think about going to a restaurant, stay home. As a server for many years, I have always maintained my tables with the utmost efficiency. Every now and again, I wouldn&apos;t get a tip. This wasn&apos;t from poor service I can assure you. Every time you leave a server no tip, not only does it ruin that person&apos;s night, mood, and future interactions with the remaining tables for the evening.

Furthermore, that person will remember you forever, and if you do go into that restaurant again, rest assured that person will tell all of their co-workers just exactly how cheap you are, and you will receive poor service again. That person isn&apos;t serving because they want to, but because they have to in order to pay bills, tuition, etc... Just a little something to chew on before the next time you decide to stiff someone.

p.s. most servers only make $2.65 an hour... try working for that plus tips, then we&apos;ll talk.
 
 oh my 
Are you guys serious? Throw a couple bones (literally $1 or $2 more) and call it a day. Why so bitter about a couple bucks? Will that change your lifestyle? Suddenly you can&apos;t go get yourself a Ferrari? Or, does it make you feel like you didn&apos;t get&quot;taken&quot;by a WAITER/WAITRESS? Does it make you feel like you stood up for yourself? Grow up, and just leave a couple extra.
 
 stellarose 
Do not go out to eat if you do not want to tip. Tipping in an social norm and is expected. Bottom line.
 
 Spare change for your thoughts 
 
 Bob 
When the service is horrible, I prefer to leave something insultingly low, like a penny, so that they know I think they were terrible and didn&apos;t just forget to leave a tip. Good work gets rewarded, laziness gets punished.
 
 Steve 
The least I have left for a tip is a quarter. Our service was so bad that I wanted to walk out leaving nothing. A friend told me that the server would just think I forgot to tip. He suggested that I leave a dime. Too bad I only had a quarter.
 
 DB 
I have left a penny, on one occasion; I wanted the server to know that I had not simply forgotten. In all my years, I have only been that irritated with the wait-staff. The other time, I went to the owner and said that the woman should be fired.
&apos;
But it HAS to be clear that is was the waiter or waitress. There are a number of times when I have been irritated, but realized that it may not have been the server that was at fault.

PS we ALL deal with pissy people in our service oriented jobs, does that mean too I should get a tip? If so, I am putting out a tip jar tomorrow for my good service. Plan on about $150- $200 for the 15%-20% tip I should get for doing a good job, of which I might add, I do every day, because I am paid to do it!
 June 30, 2011 at 12:42 am | Lynn 

HELLLLOOOO! Tips are optional-not required! If you chose to work as a waitress than it is your choice. To have me the consumer, make up the difference because of the choice you made in a profession, is just plain ridiculous! Change jobs if you don&apos;t like it! Yes I tip good and bad waitresses and waiters and very well if earned, however I will say I am sick of so many people offering a service with their hand out for a tip! Beauticians, nail salons, car washers, window cleaners, carpet cleaners, fast food restaurants, even the stupid Dairy Queen! I could go on and on! IN CALIFORNIA, WAITERS AND WAITRESSES ARE PAID THE SAME MINIMUM WAGE AS ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY WORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE . THEY ARE NOT PAID AT A LESSER AMOUNT IN THIS STATE, but they still have their hands out for a tip! So does this mean that everyone who provides a service should have their hand out for a tip, including me? I should say NOT! It is part of the job that I am paid to do, that I chose and that my company pays me to do each and every day. Each of us in some way provides a service- so should we start tipping everyone? How about when you go to the market, perhaps the cashier should have a tip jar out for tips or your dentist, doctor, the receptionist that answers your phone call, let&apos;s add a tip on those services too! After all, isn&apos;t he/she providing a service? For those of you that EXPECT a tip, I can only say that is why you are disappointed and call those that don&apos;t tip-Cheap! It is OPTIONAL and it is getting out of control!
 June 30, 2011 at 12:34 am | Valerie 

One more thing.....If you do not want to tip then please stay home. We do not want to wait on you as much as you do not want to pay us for our service.
 June 17, 2011 at 3:32 pm | Valerie 

Every single person who said that tip should not be required should rethink this statement. If companies begin to pay servers the correct hourly wage and end the tipping system, your price for your dinner will go up to include the cost. The reason servers rely on tips is because in the states we assume that our people are generous enough to know how to tip. If you do not tip your server, then you have taken money out of their pocket. Why would a server want to give you the service you think you deserve, if you are not willing to pay them the wage they deserve. I wish the industry would change and no longer rely on customers to do simple math. There are plenty of people who get paid hourly, but do not work hard enough to deserve. I would like to take money out of their pocket when they are rude and lazy.

Servers are not your punching bag when you are having a bad day.

AND just because you do not make enough money to feel&quot;wealthy&quot;does not mean you can show up to a restaurant and expect to be treated like you are. You have to pay for the 5 star treatment you want.

ALOT of people who work the industry are students. We are not less educated or well off than you. I hope you enjoy taking money out of our college fund.

I eat out too and I know when i&apos;ve seen good or bad service. I know when I have given good or bad service. I know when I give amazing service and these people do not know how to pay me for my good work.

FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW......SERVERS MAKE $2 to $3 AN HOUR......THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS......COMPANIES EXPECT THE SERVERS TO BE PAID BY THE CUSTOMERS.

It&apos;s been like this for years, so please don&apos;t pretend like you didn&apos;t know(unless you are a child).

If an 80 year old women/man can come in and tip then a 30 year old knows they are suppose to tip.
 June 17, 2011 at 3:25 pm | michelle 

tipping is an outdated concept. my family and I don&apos;t tip. I encourage others to follow those steps....afterall, it is optional. the option I pick is to not tip.
 January 18, 2011 at 3:30 pm | Nicole 

Seriously? I was a waitress once. I tried my best and always got good tips. I think if you want to get a good tip then you do a good job. Its common sense. I have absolutely left without leaving a tip, on more than one occasion. I usually leave a very generous tip, and it gets lower depending on the service. If I leave you zero tip, you know you&apos;ve done a terrible job. This is the real world, you reap what you sew. Although I had not thought of it until I read other comments on here, I do agree, why is it expected everyone will leave a tip? We pay good money for food when we go out, maybe your boss needs to be paying you more, but i don&apos;t have to, i choose to. I read that someone said it would&quot;ruin their night&quot;to get a bad tip....well how do you think your terrible service was for your patrons? Pretty sure it would ruin their night as well. Your terrible service may also cost your restaurant business. I almost always go online to check restaurant reviews before choosing to eat there. If the service was terrible, I dont go there at all.
 January 2, 2011 at 11:36 am | 
 Nicole 

Oh and it should be noted that I do believe good service should be rewarded. I was on a date once and the guy left a 2$ tip for a 50$ meal. When he wasn&apos;t looking I put more money down. Its really not attractive to not tip when you&apos;re on a date haha...unless the service was terrible and you discussed the tip prior to not leaving it.

I was a waitress, leaving no tip is wrong...very wrong. I now am in a much better financial place then I was when i was younger and almost never tip less then 20% and 10% and a note if it was really that bad. Not tipping is so rude.
 December 30, 2010 at 3:29 pm | Jason Ferrell 

i used to tip until the tips got higher and higher. now-a-days, you leave a $1 tip and you get rolling eyes. i say f u, you don&apos;t like that tip...the alternative is you get nothing. it&apos;s been 2.5 years now...haven&apos;t tipped anyone restaurant, barber, you name it. life is good and i can focus on more important things.

So wrong. Not helping out others improved your life. For some reason that does not sound right to me.

I generally leave 15% if service was adequate (i.e. my drinks don&apos;t stay empty for too long, orders are taken in a reasonably timely manner, etc.). If the restaurant is really busy, I understand that the wait for food might be a little bit longer and I&apos;m a pretty understanding person. If the server admits a mistake, apologizes and fixes it, I will still leave a tip and probably a decent one. Truly great service gets a 20% or higher tip.

The only time that I left no tip was when the waitress was rude, sat at the bar talking with friends instead of refilling our drinks and check in with us, etc. She didn&apos;t write down our order and had it wrong when she repeated it back (badly wrong, not just saying medium instead of medium-rare). We asked if she&apos;d like to write it down and she replied with a pissy&quot;I don&apos;t need to write it down!&quot;. Clearly she did since the food we received bore no resemblance to what we ordered. After she took our order, we didn&apos;t see her again until she dropped off the bill where she had written in what a 20% tip would be at the bottom of the bill. Not bloody likely when we had to ask other servers for drinks and silverware! I spoke with the manager who comped our meal and then promptly fired the server. I felt bad for her at first, but the manager must have seen my face and reassured me that she&apos;d been warned several times about her sub-par performance.

I used to wait tables, and bad day or not, I always treated my customers right. My bad day should not affect theirs.

I have left little or no tip when service was bad. And it really doesn&apos;t take much to please me; keep my drink glass filled, check and make sure everything&apos;s OK at least a couple times, be friendly, etc. Is that too much to ask?

tipping will be outlawed soon enough. it&apos;s a messed up concept and continues to get out of hand. it causes complications and over pays people who shouldn&apos;t make that much......all at the expense of making customers uncomfortable. it&apos;s a fad on a one way trip to destruction.

if you tip but don&apos;t want to....take a stand for yoursekf. http://www.notips.org

stop tipping and supporting a system that&apos;s corrupt. if you have self dignity, you won&apos;t care what others might think....that&apos;s none of their business. it&apos;s between you and the servers. it&apos;s ur life, no one elses...and you only live it once. take control.

Sometimes poor service is the the waitstaffs&apos;fault. It could be really busy. I had a female customer that was just horrid. We were two people short on the front of house and we did not have time for little stuff. I bought her everything that she needed, but it took a little longer because of being short staffed. So before she left she needed a togo box, but she paid out beforehand, and left me a 27 cent tip. I had a cold sore that day. So I rubbed my cold sore all over her togo box. I handed it to her with a smile and saying how I was sorry for the delays. Herpes, it&apos;s the gift that keeps on giving.

what a low class individual u are. childish things like that make u happy....u&apos;ll get fired soon enough...probably barely make minimum wage as is with that attitude.

I worked in 5 star restaurant for 5 years–so, I know what it&apos;s like to depend on tips to make a living. However, the amount of poor service out there is incredible. (Servers with their finger in your drink as they bring it to your table, serving men before ladies, not knowing your menu, wet or dirty tables, etc.) In most places, the wait staff isn&apos;t any better than the McDonald&apos;s crew.

If you are just an order taker and food deliverer, you aren&apos;t a waiter. When you anticipate my needs (a filled water glass, perhaps?) and provide a professional SERVICE, then you are a WAITER.

You don&apos;t deserve a tip unless you provide appropriate service.

And TIP jars? Please don&apos;t get me started.
 September 18, 2010 at 6:03 pm | Stephanie 

A lot of these arguments for not leaving a tip or for a waiter needing to earn a tip would make sense if waiters were paid decently. The fact is, they are not. $2.13 an hour is not decent pay. The fact that many places require waiters to pool their tips makes it worse–suddenly, even if you do an amazing job and get great tips, you have to give away most of it. It&apos;s hardly incentive to provide more than adequate service. A waiter is expected to get 15% by default from you so that he or she can make the equivalent of minimum wage. Anything beyond that is earned. If you don&apos;t tip, that person is making less than minimum wage. In America, people are expected to tip and so it&apos;s built into the system of how waiters are paid. It&apos;s not fair and it&apos;s not right how little waiters are paid, and it does put an unfair burden on the customer. If you don&apos;t want that burden, you have two options: a) don&apos;t go out to eat or b) lobby to get a bill passed that requires restaurants to pay their waiters minimum wage as a base rate, but somehow I doubt that people who believe you can live off of less than minimum wage would agree to give fair pay to someone they so clearly see as beneath them.

 Noel 

actually, if you silly argument has been disproved a 100 times already. waitresses do make minimum wage...if your 2.13 hourly plus tips doesn&apos;t add up to minimume wage, the restaurant is obligated by law to make up the difference.

this never happens because these stupid wait staff already make well over minimum wage. probably anywhere between $15-$40 an hour (with tips). Then they have the audacity to come here and whine about people who don&apos;t tip.

please think before you type. wait staff are over paid and they don&apos;t want to receive a fair pay from their employers...because then they can stuff cash from customers and get rich. thank you and have a good day.

I&apos;ve only left a low tip twice. In both cases, the server was condescending and rude. In one instance we went to a well-known restaurant to celebrate a job offer. My husband and I were in law school and we dressed nicely but not fashionably for the date. The server scowled at us, tried to push us into purchasing lower priced entrees, lied that the restaurant was out of the cocktail I wanted (I later saw him deliver it to another table) and then to top it all off would not let me order the dessert I wanted. He promised a special dessert even though I insisted that I wanted apple cake. He then brought out a hard chocolate chip cookie with a candle on top. To add insult to injury, he charged us $6 for it. Our bill with two bottles of wine was well over $200 and we left a ten dollar tip with a note that it was for the bus staff.

The other time, we were on our honeymoon and had ordered coffee. We waited a half hour in a nearly empty restaurant but the waiter never brought it. We asked for the bill and it included the coffee we never received; we asked the waiter to take it off our check. He refused insisting that he had brought the coffee–even though there were no coffee cups at our table. DH figured what a 12% tip would be and then subtracted the cost of the coffee. and then left that as the tip. The bill had the figures written on it. The manager must have heard the conversation b/c he apologized and brought us coffee. Our server stood a little ways away and glared at us while we finished up.

Christine, WHY in the world would you consider leaving a tip in those situations is beyond me? That&apos;s why service is so bad today, because you pay them ANYWAYS when they are beyond terrible. Charging you for something you didn&apos;t receive is ILLEGAL and I would not pay for something I didn&apos;t receive, period!! Nor would I tip on on the higher bill it would be based on that either.

You are causing your bad service by paying for it. My husband and I have stiffed many of times bad servers. If you pay them, HOW WILL THEY EVER LEARN TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND TRY THEIR BEST?

It&apos;s called POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT!! That&apos;s just like jail, some people do learn their lesson after being punished, well, if they don&apos;t have any money to pay their bills, they will have no choice to try harder or get another type of job.

Paying someone to steal is really crazy, why would you consider that, considering it was something INTENTIONALLY done and not a mistake?
 September 18, 2010 at 11:02 am | Springs1 

Do you honestly think the buss boy got that money? HECK NO, the SERVER KEPT IT YOU IDIOT!! If you want to tip the busser yourself, you have to personally hand people money, otherwise, if you give it to someone else, they aren&apos;t going to give it to the right person in mostly all cases. You are an idiot that you did that. Were you born under a rock to think the busser actually got that tip? For real!!

When you leave a tip, you&apos;re tipping the waitress, the bus staff and, more than likely, the dishwasher. When I was in high school and college, I waited at local restaurants. Its miserable work. People work for less than minimum wage, little or no health benefits, and tips are essential.

I don&apos;t begrudge a waiter or waitress poor service because I understand they may be handling six-to-seven tables or subbing for another waiter who called in sick and handling an additional 2-3 tables. I&apos;ve been in that position before when I worked as a waiter during high school and college. That&apos;s why I always tip 25% - no matter the service.

If the waiter or waitress&apos;s service has been deficient, I&apos;ll call them over and quietly tell them&quot;I wasn&apos;t satisfied with your service, but I&apos;ve been in your shoes before so I&apos;m going to leave you a decent tip anyways. But the next customer may not be so understanding.&quot;

It&apos;s only happened 3-4 times in my life, and only once did a waiter, obviously very frazzled, tell me what I could do with my tip. Instead of following his advice, I refused to pay him and, instead, walked my son and daughter over to the hostess and handed her the bill and money. I then hoisted my daughter and told her to drop the tip - a $20 bill - in the charity jar seeking funds for an expansion of the local animal shelter.

No, you are tipping your server and your server has to TIP OUT those employees, so NO, you aren&apos;t truly tipping the other people, YOUR SERVER IS!! If someone stiffs a server, the server still has to TIP OUT the others, therefore, the person that stiffed didn&apos;t tip anybody, the SERVER did!!

And one last note, I have been working in the service industry for years, mostly as a bartender and have been stiffed only one time (a freaking miracle I must admit). I have had bad days, but always smile and do the best to my ability. I make my money mostly on my personality and attentiveness, and have had people actually compliment me on how hard I work, even if their order was messed up or I may have forgotten a drink. They see me busting my ass, and I always appreciate compliments. I have never chased someone out of the door because of a low tip (I have seen others do this and I find it insulting)–I just deal with it and move on. It&apos;s part of the game. We, however, did not make up the rules of the low state wages, and do not feel entitled to be tipped, we depend on them. Believe any service industry worker, they will tell you that&quot;this is not what I want to do&quot;and are usually just doing it while in school, or for extra money, while they are looking (OR MOSTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT) what they/we want to do for the rest of their lives.

If you receive bad service, leaving no tip at all usually accomplishes nothing–we usually just think you were too drunk to remember. Be sure to tell the manager or server/bartender themselves that you were unhappy with the service, or leave a really low tip–that, right there, gets the point across for the server to get their S**t together.....

Oh Jaliska, how stupid can you be?

If getting a great paying job somewhere else was as simple as it is to you, no one would be waiting tables, especially the large group of college aged kids who do this bull***t work because it is a job you can make good money at at different times, not between the hours of 9-5 or maybe when we are in school. But with a name like Jaliska I&apos;ll (maybe incorrectly) assume you are African American, in which case we just assume you are going to stiff us anyway. Which is really annoying, considering we all have some sort of&quot;show of entitlement&quot;as according to you. I&apos;m sure the service you get when you go out is sub par, because believe it or not, as stupid as us service industry people are, we remember the bad tippers way more than we remember the great tippers.....
 September 13, 2010 at 8:32 pm | Mamma Jamma 

If you can&apos;t afford to tip, don&apos;t order out (or move to France, check out the service there!). In case you don&apos;t know, tipping is an insult in France and service is abysmal.

Simple. You are being provided a service that, in a restaurant environment is communal. Punishing the business would be more effective.

I&apos;ll steer this to home delivery. If you order food to be delivered to your home, most likely the driver took your order, helped make it and broke 13 traffic laws while risking their life (from accident and robbery) for your convenience. The rule is the GREATER of $5 OR %15, afterall that car does cost about 55 cents/mile to operate. Different animal, and some paid that slave labor mentioned in the article... and, yes, we do know who tips and doesn&apos;t... if you don&apos;t, don&apos;t complain... it would have made more economic sense for us to stay in the store folding boxes than to feed you. By the way, your address gets discussed in our community of drivers, no matter where we work.

A good tipper doesn&apos;t guarantee a good delivery time (hey, we don&apos;t make the schedule) but it does guarantee priority! Don&apos;t believe everything those order online websites tell ya&apos;either.

Years ago, a comedienne named Elayne Boosler told the story of how she was at lunch with 2 men (her manager and someone else). The waiter paid attention to the men and all but ignored her. When the waiter brought the bill–and made some comment about hoping the MEN enjoyed their meals–she pulled out her credit card–and replied that since the waiter had&quot;imagined 3 sets of balls at the table, he could also imagine his tip&quot;!

On those occasions when I have take a male friend out to lunch or dinner and was treated like an appendage of the man, I only wished I had the nerve to quote her!
 September 8, 2010 at 7:51 am |

Ha! Darling, her server was just playing the odds. 2/3 decent tip. 1/3 2 bucks at best. If you can&apos;t afford to tip, don&apos;t order out.

Seen it time and time again... the waiter didn&apos;t imagine balls, just played the odds.

Women generally tip $2 at best (especially for lunch, or ridiculously late take-out)... you get what you pay for. I hear France has quite a fashion scene, maybe you should move there.

BTW... I&apos;m sorry you have to take male friends out. Life sucks, huh?

i eat out at restaurants with my wife. when the bill comes I pay the exact amount, smile/thank the waiter, and leave. that food is too expensive as it is and the restaurant makes plenty of money and should pay their wait staff accordingly. you mean to tell me that when they charge $2 or $2.50 for a cup of fountain soda that costs them 6 cents that they cannot pay their workers. fast food places have twice as many workers or shift, pay them appropriate wages, and still charge like $1.

I&apos;m not here to make wait staff rich, if they don&apos;t get tip, they get at least minimum wage. That&apos;s all they deserve.

Thankfully in some states wait staff does not get paid slave labor wages. Industry will pay the lowest it&apos;s allowed by law. I hope in your state this is a least $7.25/hour (if Penn, no) . Who? Could you live on $290/week. $15080 (40/hr/week/7.25/hour) per year? That&apos;s more than your wait staff gets, try $1032 at lowest wage per year. SLAVE LABOR! Getting rich... you tell me? Philly, ha! nice try.

Ever thought about the property taxes there being a bit too high? or did you move already?

Restaurants pay their wait staff low salaries expecting to make their money in tips. If that isn&apos;t incentive for them to provide great service then they don&apos;t deserve tips, but you are just a cheapskate who doesn&apos;t see the value in what they do.
 September 13, 2010 at 8:44 am | Marc 

For the love of God, Joe Philly, I hope you don&apos;t eat at the same places all of the time–rest assured, you are hated wherever you go and do not deserve good service whatsoever. PA laws are one of the lowest minimum wages for the service industry, and you, sir, are an idiot.....

i take pride in my work....i&apos;m a landscaper. i know what it means to work long hard hours and use my creativity. i don&apos;t bring drinks, food, smile, and expect tip. that is bullshit. lazy fuckers.

u remember bad customers more than good ones...sounds very negative to me. looks like your just looking for an excuse to cause drama. u got tip always except once and you&apos;d rather focus on the one person than the other 500. hello ass hole.

that&apos;s y i don&apos;t tip. look at the attitude of entitlement. Plus u make good money, stop bitching. i make between 40k–50k per year depending on business....u probably make more as a server.

I don&apos;t like the percentage thing either. I mean, whether I go to Texas Roadhouse or Ruth&apos;s Chris, I get the same quality/cut of meat, cooked the same way. At Ruth&apos;s Chris, you get to pay an extra $25–$30 for them to not give you two sides and unlimited peanuts&amp;bread. On top of that, they want me to pay another extra $5–$6 because they can&apos;t/won&apos;t pay their&quot;super-trained&quot;waiters a decent wage? that&apos;s crap, plain and simple, plus the dude/dudette at TX Roadhouse does a lot more work for their anticipated tip. Of course, for the better service I leave a better tip. I think Ruth might have gotten 10% from me...
 August 30, 2010 at 10:00 am | The Bartender 

I&apos;ve never stiffed a server because I&apos;ve never received service bad enough to warrant it But I have stiffed bartenders with bad attitudes, rude cab drivers, and other service people who seem to expect a gratuity without working for it.

But I do tip insultingly low when I receive bad service. A waitress followed me out of a restaurant because I left her a measly tip.&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot;she said, trying to embarrass me in front of my girlfriend,&quot;was there something wrong with the service?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot;I replied.&quot;It sucked. And you were rude, slow, and ugly.&quot;She turned tail and that was the end of that.

The staff at Goose Island STEALS from their customers–that&apos;s why I stiffed the waitress at Goose Island in Wrigley.

When she came back with my card, she said it was refused. She tried to make it out that I should be embarrassed. At first I brushed it off and gave her cash–but then I thought about it and asked for the receipt for the refusal of credit.

She said she did not have it and I demanded to see a manager–turns out she ran a few other tables tabs on my card before she ran my bill–no doubt she was pocketing their cash tabs. The manager was equally inept–I had to demand that he go into the trash and get my receipt. Needless to say, by this time–I was making quite a big deal about these thieves.

I got the credit card company on the phone and they said they thought it was stolen because there were 3 charges on the same card within a couple minutes.

The moral of the all this was that I make sure everyone I talk to knows that they are CROOKS at GOOSE ISLAND in WRIGLEY.

I&apos;m not some waiter in an air conditioned/heated restaurant, I&apos;m outside in the freezing cold or blistering heat all day trying to please people by&quot;cleaning&quot;the 2nd biggest investment of their lives. I worked at a car wash for 4 years, got stiffed every 1 out of 4 cars easily while only making 2.50$ an hour. I didn&apos;t cry or moan about it, I just accepted the fact that TIPS ARE A GRATUITY, or a VOLUNTARY ADDITIONAL PAYMENT made for services rendered. (Wikipedia on&quot;Tip&quot;)
 August 19, 2010 at 6:32 pm | J 

I think the problem is that most people think that tipping is a right, and an obligation by the customer. But let&apos;s think about that for a second. The person who is the waiter decided to go into an industry with low wages, while the upper echelon makes hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of dollars. Also, think about what a waiter does... s/he writes down an order, picks up food, and brings it to the table. There are a reason why these jobs are minimum wage... not alot of skill set involved, yet these people expect to make at least $30k or more a year. If tipping is the norm, then tip EVERYONE. I bet a doctor would love to get 20% on a 100k procedure.
 August 4, 2010 at 4:27 pm | LH 

I tip 20% normally and if the service is mediocre i leave 15%. I&apos;ve had occasions where the service was truly deplorable, nothing to do with the kitchen, just rude terrible service. i have left $.01 and on one occasion just to make sure they got the point i wrote on the tip line&quot;Not a Damn Dime&quot;. I have always informed the manager in such cases.

Yes, twice. Once in Las Vegas at a major hotel for a show. The waiter was surly and uncouth. I left the exact tab and he proceeded to yell to all the other waitstaff that I had&apos;stiffed&apos;him. Security was called after I really did stiff him in the mouth.
The other only time I didn&apos;t tip was in Petaluma CA at a very nice restaurant. We were having a large family gathering for my daughter&apos;s BD. The waiter came over DURING dinner and explained that he was&apos;getting off&apos;in a few minutes, and would I mind settling the bill before he left. I did and it did not include a tip. Other than those 2 occasions I always tip 20% and better if the service is outstanding.
 July 29, 2010 at 6:27 pm | Rick 

There&apos;s a point that a lot of people are missing. When you go to a good restaurant, you&apos;re paying for the experience as well as the food. Bad service ruins that experience which means that you are not getting the full value you are paying for. This means that the server is effectively taking money out of your pocket. So if the server has really gone above and beyond to treat you like dirt, stiffing them on the tip merely rights this wrong.

 hot tip 

I was a server and so all the more reason why I detest rude service. I understand mistakes happen, but how the server corrects it, is what matters when it comes to my tipping.
As for the customer, some are just awful and if you don&apos;t notify the server politely and just huff and puff, or don&apos;t tell the manager and just walk out without tipping then you shouldn&apos;t go out to restaurant, and instead try to work in one. Again, mistakes happen, it is the attitude that should count.
Scott Adams suggested in one of his tips, if you do have a rude server, but are in a position where you just have to tip, put the tip on the floor! Tipping a penny also works, but only if you have brought your dissatisfaction to the servers attentions and allowed for a change.
Finally, TIP IN CASH PEOPLE, nothing&apos;s better than to go home with a pocket full of cash at the end of the day, and really it is just classier.

I would love it if restaurants gave us the option of service or no service. I would gladly get my own drinks and pick up my plate when its ready from the kitchen window similar to fast food but without the crappy fast food quality. I would go to a place like that all the time if it meant I could get good food for good prices thanks to no tip.

I always leave at least a 20% tip, but on occasion, not only have I not left a tip, but one time I walked out without even paying the bill, (it was under $10) the waitress was so bad. But, on those very rare occasions when I don&apos;t tip, I leave a note telling they WHY I didn&apos;t tip them. If people tip, no matter what, how will they learn about what they&apos;ve done wrong?
 July 27, 2010 at 4:52 pm | Panducci 

You know what people? Restaurants are in a service based industry, the Hospitality industry, and a measure of their success or failure is the SERVICE received while customers are dining there. One should never go to a restaurant with the mindset of not tipping but one should also not go to a restaurant with the mindset that the server will automatically receive a 20% tip. The definition of gratuity is: something given voluntarily or beyond obligation usually for some service. This means over and above what is required for services rendered. Servers must EARN their tips and should not expect to be tipped if service is poor. Cheeky Bastard is correct in that attitude is the most important aspect of the dining experience. (from the server-diner pov, apart from the food itself) There is a difference between a server who makes a few mistakes and one who simply does not care and this difference is usually very evident. The best advice is, make the effort and you will be rewarded for it.

thank you loser for laying the law and telling us that I need to pay $4 on a $20 tab. Maybe if this tip is so mandatory it should be written on the front door&quot;SERVICE FEE, 20% OF ORDER.&quot;Tips are optional as they always have been. If you tip, good for you. Leave those who don&apos;t tip alone. I don&apos;t see any bad manners comming from the non-tippers here. Only people who expect tip or give large tips are the ones swearing, whining, etc. Everyone should just worry about their own life and what they need to do. Respect other people and people will respect you.

 Cheeky Bastard 

Most of the people posting here not only don&apos;t have a clue as to what it takes to be a truly good server, they wouldn&apos;t even be able to perform the job with minimum competency. If they had to serve mongoloids who only thought of them as their temporary indentured servant, and demonstrated the kind of attitudes that have been posted here, they&apos;d run screaming from the place, looking for a place to lick their wounds in solitude. Inasmuch as I don&apos;t do everything perfectly all of the time, I can handle when a server makes a mistake, or even a few, as long as they genuinely make the effort (as someone who has served AND managed for nearly 30 years, I can recognize a server who hustles) to fix the error. To people who care, ATTITUDE is the most important aspect of service, but for the guest as WELL as the server. A server who acts like he/she is doing you a favor by serving you is a poor server, and has not earned what is considered the standard percentage (and it is okay to tell them their attitude was unacceptable). But a guest who enters an establishment in order to first criticize, then to dine, has no better an attitude than the surly server, and is not entitled to attentive service, as they most likely wouldn&apos;t recognize it anyway. If you walk in expecting poor service, YOU WILL GET IT. Try walking into a place thinking&quot;I&apos;d hate to have to run my butt off trying to keep a petty, tiny-minded jerk like ME happy&quot;, and you might have a more charitable attitude and understanding toward people who have to serve you to feed themselves. Very few of the posts above indicate that the writer actually thought of their server as a HUMAN BEING, and not just some tool to move around for their personal pleasure. No, there&apos;s no law that says you have to be a nice person (75% per cent of the people who posted here would be incarcerated if there were), but the nice people generally walk out satisfied, without complaint. I have waited on ignorant people, and rather than ignore them, I would feed them super-quick and get them the hell out so that I might seat someone who actually knows how to behave in a restaurant, that is, knows how to be served. Based on some of the ignorant remarks and assumptions made on this blog, just about everyone posting here (with the exception of the food service emplyees) definitely needs&quot;guest training&quot;. To the person(s) who claimed to have demanded that their server be fired, you know even less about dining and service than you do about manners and breeding, which means LESS than nothing. Of course, YOU were so horribly wronged that the server who offended you should be dismissed immediately; remember that the next time you have a bad day at work (if you even work). Again, all of the whiners here who claim to know such much about the subject COULD NOT DO THE JOB without more whining and crying, and finally quitting.

It occurs to me, after reading these posts, that a good subtitle for this article would be&quot;Dinner For Schmucks&quot;.

Ever actually stayed at a hotel?

I&apos;m the gentleman that&apos;s at the desk, the guy who gets the call to dig through a cramped closet in the dead of the night to find a fluffier pillow, the guy who people scream at because we&apos;re sold out, the guy who gets screamed at because our in house restaurant has the audacity to close at 1AM. I&apos;m the sucker who scoured the bar at 2AM to steal a carafe of milk and warm it for someone&apos;s child who had a nightmare... I&apos;m the guy who&apos;ll run someone a tray of breakfast from our buffet to surprise their wife on their honeymoon. I&apos;m the guy who calls your cabs, manages your phone calls, has your name, your credit card, your address... who secures your rest, obtains your entertainment, checks your flight, and deals with trying to piecemeal a dozen languages together that I don&apos;t actually speak.

Guess what?

I don&apos;t get tips, because people don&apos;t tip hotel staff (with the exception of running food or hauling luggage). I&apos;m the desk guy who does every job at the hotel and some jobs I shouldn&apos;t... and probably even a few things I -really- shouldn&apos;t, just to make a guest happy.

And never once have I complained about someone being&apos;cheap&apos;for not tipping me. In fact, I make it a point of personal pride to refuse tips. I&apos;ll take something if the person is -really- adamant, but my first answer is always&quot;That&apos;s quite alright Sir/Madam, that&apos;s what we&apos;re here for&quot;.

So you&apos;ll excuse me when I say I&apos;m pretty confident I could serve a dozen tables, after all, I&apos;m serving 100 hotel rooms right now.

I remember being able to see the narrow kitchen window from my seat, with my pancakes sitting under the heat lamp. I was so tempted to get my own pancakes but my companion would not allow it. When I pointed out that my pancakes were cold and had been sitting on the shelf, the (formerly invisible) waitress denied it. I have no idea where she had been, since the restaurant was practically empty.

I don&apos;t remember what I did about the tip, but I probably left a buck.
 July 27, 2010 at 8:47 am | Rick 

I own a Catering company and I&apos;ve worked in food service since I was 16 years old. I&apos;m more shocked by how people treat those in the service industry than the way any waiter has ever treated me. I have never understood why people who are being served treat the server so poorly. I always reward good service with a substantial tip and poor service gets 15 to 20%. I know how hard even a poor server works and the sort of people they get to put up with day in and day out. If you don&apos;t like tipping, stick to fast food and take out... and oh ya... if you order take out from a restaurant tip the person who assembles your order, they deserve it! If you want to make a great servers day, try leaving a tip that&apos;s more than the cost of the meal. I once went to dinner with a millionaire, 20 of us were at the table. He payed the bill then asked us each to pay our portion as the tip because the service had been outstanding and really made the evening. What fun to leave behind a $1000 tip! When large groups come in more often than not the tip gets messed up and a lot of hard work goes unrewarded.... especially when people split the check.

SOUNDS LIKE YOU SHOULD COOK FOR YOURSELF, EAT AT HOME AND CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF. OTHERWISE YOU ARE BEING DISRESPECTFUL, BECAUSE IF YOU CAN&apos;T AFFORD TO PAY FOR SERVICE, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS DEMANDING IT, ESPECIALLY FROM SMEONE WHOSE SOLE BUSINESS IS TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR LIFE WHILE SERVING YOU.

Ok so I am a cook, and I feel that the kitchen deserves a piece of that tip as much as the server and bus boy. Cause lets face it if the food sucks there would be no one in the seats in the first place. That being said I have left a penny and have walked out leaving not tip, I have also left $1. If someone is having an off day then they are usually apologetic, and nice and do not fall under my crappy tip rule. I find that servers that are inattentive and rude are usually like that all the time, no need to tell a manager since they probably already know this fact. The only time I bring a manager into a situation is if the food is miserable and I either want a replacement or I am not going to be returning to that establishment. Fact of the matter is that restaurant managers/general managers know that you are very likely to return to a place if the service is crappy and the food is good. So they care to a point but usually not enough to hire someone else. The next person could be worse and they have to spend time and effort training that person. I know that at the end of the night the servers that pool will get pissy with a lazy server letting them know they are taking money from them. If there is no pooling then that person will prob not stay there since it is a waste of time. So I am in favor of having a low base pay and let them keep there tips, I feel it makes hard workers work harder, and lazy people get filtered out.

I was already well aware of how waiters and waitresses often get stiffed on their checks. I usually leave a really good tip because of this, and because sometimes people get stiffed on tips even if they are great servers. If the service is really great, I will even leave up to a 50% tip and give praise to the manager. I usually try to cut servers some slack, but there are two times I left a penny as a tip. (I leave a penny instead of nothing so they know that it&apos;s not that I forgot to tip, I was just extremely unsatisfied.) The first time I was in a (not very busy) restaurant and it took 40 minutes just to take our drink order. Our waiter only stopped by twice (to take our order and deliver food and drinks at the same time). The second time I was in a restaurant where the waitress had 3 tables. I had to ask for a drink refill 4 times, my glass was empty when I got my food and was not filled til after I finished eating. Even then she brought me the wrong drink. Finally the waitress of the other section was kind enough to get me what I needed. I actually did leave a tip on the other waitress&apos;table. I&apos;m always polite to my servers, even when I&apos;m upset about the food or service, I still handle it respectfully. I won&apos;t yell or get rude, but I will leave less of a tip and ask to see the manager. If the service is incredibly bad, I am not going to pay for a service I did not receive.

Doesn&apos;t is seem like the real problem is that there is this special minimum wage for waitstaff? If waiters/waitresses weren&apos;t so dependent on tips to just earn minimum wage, then maybe the issue wouldn&apos;t be so heated. The few times I&apos;ve gotten truly terrible service I have given a low tip, my logic being that, no matter how bad one is at waiting tables, one does deserve at least minimum wage while on the job (like every one else in any other profession). However, I hate the assumption that I should be paying 20% to someone who is treating me like crap — that person is not getting anything beyond the bare minimum from me!

Restaurant staff do make minimum wage. If they don&apos;t mkae it in tips, the establishment makes up the rest. They are guaranteed minimum wage when they sign up for the job. The 2.13/hr is just a ploy to make customers feel bad and think they need to pay the wait staff&apos;s salary. It&apos;s just a trick. In the end, the wait staff make a lot more than minimum wage every pay check and the restaurant owners get away with almost no overhead costs.

I dont tip and usually go to restaurants with a no tipping policy. There is a saying that insanity cannot last forever. Tipping will gradually make it&apos;s way out of this world when people come to terms with how stupid of a concept it is. First the excuse was that if you get good service then you can give tip (if you want)...now it&apos;s&quot;oh the wait staff don&apos;t make any money, they need tips&quot;so you better tip or else *******. The amount of tip keeps going up too, from 10 to 15 and now 20%. Once the American public sees how silly it is to pay someones salary we will see changes. The cheap ones are not the ones who refuse to tip, the cheap ones are the wait staff who beg for a few bucks using threats even though they already make minimum wage.

Enough said.

&quot;Tipping will gradually make it&apos;s way out of this world....&quot;The only flaw in your grand master plan there Noel, is that there are more decent people out there than people like you. Might be best if you stay at home and learn to serve yourself first...

Most servers make WAY more than minimum wage. If its a popular restaurant they can easily make over $20 an hour, all thanks to tips. If you ask me servers are highly overpaid. Why do you think so many people wait tables for their whole lives? In order to make minimum wage they just need 2 tables that give a $2 tip an hour, obviously that is extremely easy to hit even on a slow day, usually one table is enough to put them past minimum wage. Havent you ever heard a waiter brag about making $500 every friday night in tips?

Here is the best&quot;leave a penny&quot;story I have ever heard. A friend went out to dinner and had a flagrantly awful waitress. He left her a penny. As he and his wife were walking out, she chased them down with the penny held high for all to see:&quot;Sir, sir, you forgot this&quot;. He took the penny from her and pressed it into her hand:&quot;No dear, this is for you. You EARNED it&quot;. Game, set, and match. You don&apos;t mess with a man after you&apos;ve ruined his meal.

BTW, he has been a waiter and is generally a generous tipper. For him to do this the service had to be willfully bad with an extra helping of attitude.

Tipping well is my favorite affordable luxury–if I can afford to eat out, I can afford to pay an extra 20% on top of that–or 25%-30%-35%+, etc. if it&apos;s a cheap meal–I figure the staff worked just as hard to cook and serve a $5 entree as a $25 one, so it&apos;s a shame that a percentage-based tip reflects this. And although I sometimes choose not to revisit restaurants where I&apos;ve had what I consider a less-than-optimal experience (which is the case with any type of business where I have a choice of provider), I would never mess with someone&apos;s paycheck by taking it upon myself to withhold a tip–which is, as an earlier poster pointed out, taxed by the IRS whether or not it is actually received (i.e. the IRS assumes you receive a certain percentage of your income in tips and taxes you accordingly). I wouldn&apos;t want everyone I encounter in the course of my job to have the power to decide whether or not I get to earn my paycheck, or whether they get to retain a portion of it themselves–I work for an elementary school, and although the kids like me well enough, I&apos;m sure they&apos;d much rather have my salary to spend on bubblegum. Luckily, I don&apos;t have to depend on the goodwill of the individual taxpayer (including myself, as I live and work in the same jurisdiction) to earn my paycheck, I just have to make sure my principal stays happy, which isn&apos;t always easy, but is much easier than having to read the minds of hundreds of random strangers.

Anyway, dropping a few bucks on tips each time I eat out makes me feel like I am at least trying to be a decent human being, whether or not it&apos;s been a total lovefest between me and the restaurant staff. Like the say in the Visa (or Mastercard?) commercials...&quot;Not feeling like a dickweed...Priceless.&quot;

When I was growing up my Dad was a notoriously bad tipper. It didn&apos;t matter if the service was bad or good, he usually left no tip at all. One day we left a restaurant in Seattle, the waitress ran out after us and stopped my Dad asking him if there was a problem with the service or the food. He was so embarassed at being called on his bad tipping, he mumbled an apology and never failed to tip again after that. incident.

in Canada where minimum wage is over $10/hour, there seems to be a prevalent attitude of&apos;I deserve a huge tip for even coming near your table&apos;. If I get attitude, the server gets attitude back, usually in the form of a low, or 0 tip. And that is exactly what should happen. How else are lousy servers culled from the herd? I&apos;m doing them a favor; they figure out that this isn&apos;t the line of work for them and go get a government job where their lousy attitude is rewarded.

@nicole: If I knew where you and other&apos;servers&apos;were who glory in screwing with people&apos;s meals, I&apos;d turn your asses in for tampering with food, and fast. Anybody in&apos;the biz&apos;who sees or hears this kind of&apos;mess with the food&apos;crapola SHOULD. A tip? More like a reward from the health department!

So thanks–you just ENSURED that I won&apos;t be going out to eat, much less leaving the generous tips I always used to. Wouldn&apos;t surprise me if there are a whole lot more like me who make the same decision, either, and I hope they do.

I have walked out without paying the entire check. Im no sucker.

Actually I did it because the waiter decided to disappear for 20 minutes to talk to his friends. Thats fine I just walked out. Problem is many waiters expect to be tipped no matter what. I don&apos;t work that way. If you want to be an ass you will be tipped like an ass, with nothing or maybe a dollar.

My mother has waitressed for 20 years and I know when somebody just has a bad day or when someone is being an asshole. I understand maybe something happened and your not working 100% not everyone does anyway. Just shows more with waiters because they are in front of people in close range all the time. I will leave a decent tip but if it always happens then I will have to tip less and go somewhere else.

I am also not the type to make a scene at a restaurant and call managers because the job is tough and people shouldn&apos;t get fired for one event. I rather just tip badly and not go again. If they get mad I will just say bring me the manager or keep your mouth shut and keep your job.

Sure, I have had lousy service lots of times, but not to tip because of that? Oh, come on! Then, let&apos;s not pay for the item we purchased at the department store because the person who waited on us was rude, incompetent, etc. and let&apos;s not pay for the less-than courteous cab driver even though we did get to our destination in one piece, etc. It could go on and on.

I think that wait service is not good because so many people never learned how to serve or how to be polite or listen or not be intrusive, even, but this does not mean you are supposed be Mr. or Mrs. Cheapie Who Will Cheat the Waiter of a Job Imperfectly Done.

I have known too many cheapskates in this world to believe that the real reason someone won&apos;t tip is because of the lousy service. No, they are just waiting for an excuse to be cheap, that&apos;s all!

Not tipping is cheap? ....I don&apos;t think so. There are people who don&apos;t tip because they don&apos;t want to. I think your cheap for wanting the extra money. If someone comes and eats $20 worth of food and leaves no tip, why are you so cheap to be compulsively begging for those $3? Or whining about it on this forum. I thought you waiters/waitresses made top dollar and aren&apos;t cheap. Crying about 4 or 5 bucks or even 10 bucks sounds cheap to me. Shut up, do your job, and you&apos;ll get tips sometimes, other times you won&apos;t.

Since most of these waiters/waitresses make so much money...why beg for it from people who make less than them. May be the person you waiting on only makes $8 or $9 an hour. It&apos;s still their right to eat out when and if they want to. It isn&apos;t you right however, to be malicious or rude to them for not tipping. But we all know that when servers don&apos;t get their tips, their real personalities start showing.

Go anywhere in the world and I guarantee you will receive better service where tipping is not customary. There&apos;s hard working honest people, then their are trashy people who won&apos;t even lift an arm without asking for a buck. Cheap fucks.

jenny I don&apos;t understand your math....how would the IRS know what your customers&apos;bills amounted to?
And as a solution to the tip pool...which I DESPISE and would never partake in ever again....I always give my waitresses their tips in an envelope with their names on it.

If you go to Europe, correct–tips are not&quot;expected,&quot;but the meal will cost more of course–not only due to currency conversion. Yes, tipping is part of our culture here because servers are paid less than minimum wage. European servers are not paid less than minimum wage. I get the point very well, but it appears you are going to be determined to be cheap. That is why I say you are the kind of customer I would hope I wouldn&apos;t get, because you feel that you deserve service without paying for it.

Go somewhere else where you are not waited on if you don&apos;t want to pay for it. While I condone absence of a tip if the service is sincerely that poor, by making a habit of not tipping at all, you&apos;re showing that you don&apos;t care whether the service is good or bad. You also are showing that you don&apos;t care about the wait staff at all. If that&apos;s the case, you&apos;re truly lucky that their job on the wait staff is to serve you and care for you, because you wouldn&apos;t be getting it otherwise.

The fact of the matter is that sometimes poor service deserves a poor tip- but a tip of zero dollars is actually a negative tip because of tip pooling arrangements and taxes. A waiter is assumed by the restaurant to have made a 15 to 20 percent tip and is usually required to give a certain percentage of their sales (at my restaurant 4%) to bussers and bartenders. Moreover a server is presumed by the IRS to have left the restaurant with 11% of their sales in tips and are taxed accordingly. So if your bill is $100 and you leave a $0 tip the server still has to give $4 to the busser and bartender, and is taxed on$11 of income. All in all your server has LOST $5-7 simply for having waited on you.

Before you leave a $0 tip consider the fact that no matter how horrible the service was they really shouldn&apos;t be forced to PAY for the pleasure of waiting on you, and then think about cutting them a little slack.

A quick talk with the manager is a much more effective solution and is highly likely to result in getting a few items taken off your bill- then tip 15% on the reduced price- the server loses a tip on items taken off the bill and gets a smaller (15% ought to be the minimum tip) tip on the items remaining.
