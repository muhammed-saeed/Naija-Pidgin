Subject: Measurements

A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink
and while he&apos;s drinking it the monkey jumps all around all over the
place. The monkey grabs some olives off the bar and eats them, then
grabs some sliced limes and eats them, then jumps up on the pool table,
grabs the cue ball, sticks it in his mouth and swallows it whole.
The bartender screams at the guy,&quot;Did you see what your monkey just did?&quot;
The guy says,&quot;No, what?&quot;
&quot;He just ate the cue ball off my pool table, whole!&quot;, says the bartender.
&quot;Yeah, that doesn&apos;t surprise me,&quot;replied the patron. He eats
everything in sight, the little bastard. I&apos;ll pay for the cue ball and
stuff.&quot;
He finishes his drink, pays his bill, and leaves.
Two weeks later he&apos;s in the bar again, and he has his monkey
with him. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar
again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a
maraschino cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his butt, pulls
it out, and eats it.
The bartender is disgusted.&quot;Did you see what your monkey did
now?&quot;, he asks.
&quot;Now what?&quot;, responds the patron.
&quot;Well, he stuck a maraschino cherry up his butt, then pulled it
out and ate it!&quot;, says the barkeeper.
&quot;Yeah, that doesn&apos;t surprise me,&quot;replied the patron.&quot;He
still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that damn cue
ball he measures everything first!&quot;

15&gt;Mysterious late-night phone calls:&quot;I can&apos;t stop thinking about
you... and that&apos;s a good thing!&quot;

14&gt;Contents of your curbside recycling tub stolen and replaced
with juice can pencil holders and milk carton flower vases.

13&gt;On her show she makes a gingerbread house that looks exactly
like your split-level, right down to the fallen-over licorice
downspout and the stuck half-open graham cracker garage door.

12&gt;You get a threatening note made up of letters cut out of a
magazine with pinking shears, and they&apos;re all the same size,
the same font, and precisely lined up in razor-sharp rows.

11&gt;Size 6 Bruno Magli imprints on all your doilies.

10&gt;You find your pet bunny on the stove in an exquisite tarragon,
rose petal&amp;saffron demi-glace&apos;, with pecan-crusted hearts of
palm and a delicate mint-fennel sauce.

9&gt;The unmistakable aroma of potpourri follows you -- even after
you leave the bathroom.

8&gt;You discover that every napkin in the whole friggin&apos; house has
been folded into a swan.

7&gt;No matter *where* you eat, your place setting always includes
an oyster fork.

6&gt;Annoying crank phone calls begin with,&quot;Hold, please, for
Ms. Stewart.&quot;

5&gt;Twice this week you&apos;ve been the victim of a drive-by doilying.

4&gt;That telltale lemon slice in the dog&apos;s water bowl.

3&gt;The sharpened macaroni shells underfoot in the bathroom are
stained to match the shower curtain.

2&gt;You wake up in the hospital with a concussion and endive
stuffing in every orifice.

1&gt;You awaken one morning with a glue gun pointed squarely at

14&gt;&quot;Does this Star Fleet Academy uniform make me look fat?&quot;

13&gt;&quot;Make it so, Baby, make it so.&quot;

12&gt;&quot;It&apos;s pointless to compare the original crew to the Next
Generation, since they&apos;re only fictional characters anyway.&quot;

11&gt;&quot;I dunno, sometimes I wonder if the show was really deserving
of all this attention.&quot;

10&gt;&quot;Kirk, Picard... what&apos;s the difference, they&apos;re both losers.
I&apos;ll take Will Robinson and Dr. Smith any day.&quot;

9&gt;&quot;I got laid last night!&quot;

8&gt;&quot;Look! It&apos;s Eddie Murphy!&quot;

7&gt;&quot;You&apos;re nuts. Swimming is by far the hardest part of any Iron
Man Triatholan.&quot;

6&gt;&quot;Oooh, Girlfriend -- Just look at all these hunks! Set your
phaser for &apos;Love!&apos;&quot;

5&gt;&quot;If you think the brie&apos;s good, you should try the salmon pate.&quot;

and the Number 1 Thing You&apos;ll Never
Hear at a Star Trek Convention...


1&gt;&quot;Hey, guys, how &apos;bout we finish this conversation over a beer
at the topless bar?&quot;

 

Subject: Star Trek with Dilbert Management

What the 24th century would be like under today&apos;s management techniques.

After the crew is told they are now Empowered, Dr. Crusher begins
doing medical experiments on unsuspecting enlisted personnel while Worf
slaughters everyone he considers&quot;weak&quot;.

Data fails an ISO9000 audit because the construction of his
positronic brain isn&apos;t properly documented. He curses Dr. Suhn&apos;s record
keeping as he&apos;s stripped for parts.

All members of the ship&apos;s maintenance crew are required to be
involved in Quality Circles. The loss of productive work time causes
them to cut back on scheduled repairs, resulting in a warp core breach
that kills everyone.

Commander Riker is fired after a round of&quot;right sizing&quot;. Star Fleet
decided that it didn&apos;t really need someone to seduce alien females and
smirk a lot.

As part of the new Dignity Enhancement program, Picard is forced to
allow Troi to wear uniforms that cover her breasts.

Star Fleet decides to adopt the Borg&quot;Team Building&quot;methods and
requires all newborn babies to be implanted with computer interface
devices. As a bonus this cuts down on carpal tunnel disability claims.

The Enterprise finds that it can no longer communicate with Star
Fleet Command because they&apos;re still running an old version of Windows and
can&apos;t get budget approval for the upgrade.

As part of a cycle time reduction plan, the crew is ordered to cut
the time necessary to encounter and escape from new life forms from once
a week to 5 days a week. A re-use program is introduced under the
nickname RERUNS (Reap Earnings and Royalties Using No-longer-produced
Shows).

Picard is ordered to go to diversity sensitivity training after
system logs indicate that he has repeatedly disparaged the Ferengis, the
Q and the Romulans.

A ship-wide reorganization results in Worf becoming the ship&apos;s
counsellor, Dr. Crusher taking over the engine room, Deanna managing
weapons, Data running sick bay and Geordi at the helm. They were
conquered by a Klingon freighter 15 minutes later.

The crew mutinies when they are given their annual performance
reviews and find that, despite saving the universe numerous times,
they&apos;re still only getting 3% raises.

Subject: Football Humor

by a Rottweiler. Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board off a

Subject: Only in Arkansas

Washington Times 10-21-96

ONLY IN ARKANSAS

Here&apos;s more on why Arkansas is everyone&apos;s favorite state. This is
from the Arkansas Democrat Gazett:&quot;Two local men were seriously injured
when their pickup truck left the road and hit a tree near Cotton Plant on
State Highway 38 early Monday morning ...&quot;Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc,
and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious condition
at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip. [Note to city slickers:
frog-gigging, or frog-sticking, is how, armed with a small pitchfork, you
catch frogs from the bayou bank. Frog legs make a tasty supper.]

&quot;On an overcast Sunday night, Poole&apos;s pickup truck headlights
malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the
older-model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not
available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit
perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. Upon
inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate and the two
men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River Bridge.

&quot;After traveling approximately 20 miles and just before crossing the
river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in
the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right, exiting
the pavement and striking the tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and
abrasions from the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other
wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released.

&quot;&apos;Thank God we weren&apos;t on that bridge when Thurston shot his nuts
off or we might have been dead.&apos; said Wallis.&quot;&apos;I&apos;ve been a trooper
for 10 years in this part of the world,&apos; said Deputy Snyder, &apos;but this
is a first for me. I can&apos;t believe that those two would admit how the
accident happened.&apos;

&quot;Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole&apos;s wife, asked how
many frogs the boys had caught, and did anyone think to get them from
the truck.&quot;

the following, exactly as shown:

1. Right-click on the desktop, and select&quot;New Folder&quot;. Name the folder:
and now, the moment you&apos;ve all been waiting for
2. Right-click the folder and rename it to:

You must type it exactly as shown, with the capital letters in the correct
places. If it works correctly, when you open the folder you&apos;ll see a blue
screen, and a nice MIDI musical score will play while the names appear.


Subject: Dueling Sins

A Catholic priest and a Rabbi who had been friends for years were out
fishing one day. Out in the middle of the lake they began to talk about
their life&apos;s experiences and their devotion to their respective faiths.
The priest was curious about certain Jewish traditions, one of them being
that truly devoted Jews are forbidden to eat pork products.&quot;Just between
you and me---&quot;, he asked,&quot;Have you ever tasted pork?&quot;. The Rabbi paused
for a minute and confessed,&quot;Years ago, when I was a young boy, we went to
a delicatessen in the city for lunch. I did not realize until I had
finished half my meal that I was accidentally served a ham sandwich. I
did not eat another bite, and I prayed to God for forgiveness. I have
never touched pork since.&quot;About five minutes later the Rabbi asked,&quot;I
know it&apos;s against your vow of celibacy, but have you ever loved a woman
before?&quot;. Since the Rabbi had openly confessed his sin earlier, the
priest felt obligated to respond in kind,&quot;Years ago shortly before I
joined the seminary, I met a woman who studied in a nearby school. We
were both young and the blood was hot. One night, we relented to the
temptations of the flesh. Through prayer, I have done my best to repent
for my wrongdoing and I have worked ever so much harder to fulfill my
commitment to the Lord.&quot;About five minutes passed before the Rabbi
finally spoke about the priest&apos;s sin.&quot;Beats ham doesn&apos;t it?&quot;

 

Subject: Some Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey

If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let&apos;em go,
because, man, they&apos;re gone.

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?
We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.&quot;

To me, it&apos;s a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you
walk around. That way, if anybody says,&quot;Hey, can you give me a hand?&quot;
You can say,&quot;Sorry, got these sacks.&quot;

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take
my nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old
burned-outwarehouse.&quot;Oh no,&quot;I said,&quot;Disneyland burned down.&quot;He cried
and cried,but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good
joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting
pretty late.

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face.

If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I bet the
most common question people would ask is,&quot;Can&apos;t you make it shoot
farther?&quot;&quot;No, I&apos;m sorry. That&apos;s as far as it shoots.&quot;

Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo,
flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he&apos;s carrying a
beautiful rose in his beak, and also he&apos;s carrying a very beautiful
painting with his feet. And also, you&apos;re drunk.

I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
children&apos;s children, because I don&apos;t think children should be having sex.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him
is,&quot;God is crying.&quot;And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing
to tell him is,&quot;Probably because of something you did.&quot;

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror,
because I bet that&apos;s what REALLY throws you into a panic.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first
instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant and she
fell on me. Then it wouldn&apos;t seem quite so funny.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there&apos;s no music, no choreography
and the dancers hit each other.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king, they don&apos;t
just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good
ideas.

If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons (maybe

Instead of having&quot;answers&quot;on a math test, they should just call them
&quot;impressions,&quot;and if you got a different&quot;impression,&quot;so what, can&apos;t we
all be brothers?

Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some sort of
striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.

I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out that
I&apos;d just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I was
thinking about doing that anyway.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. And
since he&apos;s so busy, you&apos;d probably have to run up to him real quick and
hand it to him.

Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word itself.

MANKIND. Basically, it&apos;s made up of two separate words&quot;mank&quot;and&quot;ind.&quot;
What do these words mean? It&apos;s a mystery and that&apos;s why so is mankind.

If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying
forward into the future, it&apos;s probably best to avoid eye contact.

It&apos;s easy to sit there and say you&apos;d like to have more money. And I guess
that&apos;s what I like about it. It&apos;s easy. Just sitting there, rocking back
and forth, wanting that money.

If you ever reach total enlightenment while you&apos;re drinking a beer, I bet
it makes beer shoot out your nose.

To me, clowns aren&apos;t funny. In fact, they&apos;re kinda scary. I&apos;ve wondered
where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the
circus and a clown killed my dad.

As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I
sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch of
honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.

I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I
can picture us attacking that world, because they&apos;d never expect it.

I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my
brain, because later you might think you&apos;re having a good idea but it&apos;s
just eggs hatching.

Whenever you read a good book, it&apos;s like the author is right there, in the
room talking to you, which is why I don&apos;t like to read good books.

What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing and
the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get drunk?
And after you&apos;re real drunk, maybe go down to the public
park and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go
to sleep.

Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it,
and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that&apos;s like a
regular window.

During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not
putting on your armor because you were&quot;just going down to the corner.&quot;

If I ever get real rich, I hope I&apos;m not real mean to poor people, like I
am now.

When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the
police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started
wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.

I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all
day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had.
It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle
marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint.

Here&apos;s a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don&apos;t know anybody:
First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra garbage
that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out too.
Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.

Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even
if you don&apos;t know what your rights are, or who the person is you&apos;re
talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door.

If you&apos;re a cowboy and you&apos;re dragging a guy behind your horse, I bet it
would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading a
magazine.

If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think it&apos;s
okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to teach him
to do some tricks. But only if you&apos;re serious about adopting the vulture.

Broken promises don&apos;t upset me. I just think, why did they believe me?

If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and while
you&apos;re in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it on a
truck and take it to another city, boy, I don&apos;t know what to tell you.

One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don&apos;t run with a
wooden stake.

If you go to a costume party at your boss&apos;s house, wouldn&apos;t you think a
good costume would be to dress up like the boss&apos;s wife? Trust me, it&apos;s
not.

Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon.
But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you&apos;d look out your
little window and think,&quot;Boy, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not out
in that.&quot;

Consider the daffodil. And while you&apos;re doing that, I&apos;ll be over here,
looking through your stuff.

For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here&apos;s a tip: why not add a
slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?

I&apos;d like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a fish
out of a lake, and then maybe he&apos;s flying along, low to the ground, and
the fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that&apos;s a documentary.

If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to sign a peace
treaty, just as I was signing, I&apos;d glance over the treaty and then
suddenly act surprised.&quot;Wait a minute! I thought we won!&quot;

Sometimes you have to be careful when selecting a new name for yourself.
For instance, let&apos;s say you have chosen the nickname&quot;Fly Head.&quot;Normally
you would think that&quot;Fly Head&quot;would mean a person who has beautiful
swept-back features, as if flying through the air. But think again.
Couldn&apos;t it also mean&quot;having a head like a fly&quot;? I&apos;m afraid some people
might actually think that.

Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are losing
each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got
scared.

I hope that after I die, people will say of me:&quot;That guy sure owed me a
lot of money.&quot;

I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then,
Yahoo!, I&apos;d have all my money back.

I think a good product would be&quot;Baby Duck Hat.&quot;It&apos;s a fake baby duck,
which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater
until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then all
of the sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man
those ducks really take off! Also Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

If you get invited to your first orgy, don&apos;t just show up nude. That&apos;s a
common mistake. You have to let nudity&quot;happen.&quot;

The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of the
watering hole and started to drink. But then he looked around and saw
skulls and bones everywhere.&quot;Uh-oh,&quot;he thought.&quot;This
watering hole is reserved for skeletons.&quot;

I worked for a bit in the Coast Guard in Wales and I used to send

with
that phone.

Subject: To be sung with the theme from the Beverly Hillbillys:

To be sung with the theme from the Beverly Hillbillys:

 

Come and listen to a story &apos;bout a man named Ted,
A poor college kid, barely kept his family fed.
But then one day he was talking to a recruiter
who said,&quot;they&apos;ll pay big bucks if ya work on a computer&quot;...

UNIX, that is....Windows 95....Workstations...C...VB

Well, the first thing ya know ol&apos; Ted&apos;s an engineer.
The kinfolk said&quot;Ted, move away from here&quot;.
They said&quot;Arizona is the place you oughta be&quot;
so he bought some donuts and he moved to Ahwatukee...

Intel, that is..,.dry heat... no amusement parks.....

On his first day at work, they stuck him in a cube.
Fed him lots of donuts and sat him in a tube.
They said&quot;your project&apos;s late, but we know just what to do
Instead of 40 hours, we&apos;ll work you 52!&quot;

OT, that is ...unpaid...mandatory.....

The weeks rolled by and things were looking bad.
Schedules started sliiping and some managers were mad.
They called another meeting and decided on a fix.
the answer&apos;s very simple...&quot;we&apos;ll work him sixty-six!&quot;

Tired, that is.. stressed out.. no social life....

Months turned into years and his hair was turning gray.
Ted worked very hard while his life just slipped away
Waiting to retire when he turned 64,
instead he got a call and escorted out the door.

Laid off, that is...de-briefed...unemployed.

Now the moral of the story is, do what you are told
companies will use you and discard you when you&apos;re old
So gather up your friends and start your own firm,
Beat the competition, watch old bosses squirm.

Millionaires that is.....Bill Gates...Steve Jobs..

Ya&apos;ll come back now, ya hear.


There! Now get back to work!

Subject: Forestry Service comments

ACTUAL comments received in 1996 from the USFS Bridger Wilderness
registration sheets and comment cards.

- Trails need to be wider so people can walk while holding hands.

- Instead of a permit system or regulations, the Forest Service needs to
reduce world-wide population growth to limit the number of visitors to
wilderness.

- Ban walking sticks in wilderness. Hikers that use walking sticks are
more likely to chase animals.

- All the mile markers are missing this year.

- Found a smoldering cigarette left by a horse.

- Trail needs to be reconstructed. Please avoid building trails that go
uphill.

- Too many bugs and leaches and spiders and spider webs. Please spray the
wilderness to rid the area of these pests.

- Please pave the trails so they can be plowed of snow during the winter.

- Chairlifts need to be in some places so that we can get to wonderful
views without having to hike to them.

- The coyotes made too much noise last night and kept me awake. Please
eradicate these annoying animals.

- A small deer came into my camp and stole my jar of pickles. Is there a
way I can get reimbursed? Please call ___ ___ ____.

- Reflectors need to be placed on trees every 50 feet so people can hike
at night with flashlights.

- Escalators would help on steep uphill sections.

- Need more signs to keep area pristine.

- A McDonalds would be nice at the trailhead.

- The places where trails do not exist are not well marked.

- I brought lots of sandwich makings, but forgot bread. If you have extra
bread, leave it in the yellow tent at V Lake.

- Too many rocks in the mountains.

Subject: Engineering, the Microsoft way

There are three engineers in a car: an electrical engineer, a chemical
engineer, and a Microsoft engineer. They are driving down the road when
suddenly the car just stops They pull over by the side of the road, and
the three engineers look at each other, wondering what could be wrong.

The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of the
car, starting with the battery, and trying to trace where a fault might
have occurred.

The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that maybe
the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere.

Then, the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes up
with a suggestion:&quot;Why don&apos;t we close all the windows, get out, get back
in, open the windows again, and maybe it&apos;ll work?!&quot;


Subject: Going to Jamaica

As passengers were being seated on an aircraft bound for Jamaica, some
confusion occurred in the first class cabin. A male passenger had been
assigned to seat 4A which was already occupied by a beautiful blonde
woman. The passenger requested assistance from the Forward Cabin Flight
Attendant.

The Flight Attendant checked the man&apos;s boarding pass and found it to be in
order and with the correct seat assignment. She then asked the blonde for
her boarding pass only to discover that the blonde woman had been assigned
a coach seat in the rear of the plane. The Flight Attendant politely
requested the blonde to relocate to her assigned seat.

The blonde woman became furious. She said&quot;Look, just because I&apos;m blonde
doesn&apos;t mean that I&apos;m stupid! I may be blonde, but I&apos;m smart, I own my
own business, I&apos;m going on vacation and I absolutely refuse to move from
this seat until this airplane lands in Jamaica!&quot;The Flight Attendant,
not wishing to create an incident, decided to let the more experienced
Head Flight Attendant handle this situation.

When asked to move by the Head Flight Attendant, the blonde, visibly
angered and raising her voice, responded in the same fashion.&quot;Look, just
because I&apos;m blonde doesn&apos;t mean that I&apos;m stupid!! I may be blonde, but
I&apos;m smart, I own my own business, I&apos;m going on vacation and I absolutely
refuse to move from this seat until this airplane lands in Jamaica!!&quot;The
Head Flight Attendant decided that the Co-Pilot should deal with this
nearly hysterical woman.

When the Co-Pilot asked her to move, the blonde, now screaming at the top
of her lungs, angrily bellowed&quot;Look, just because I&apos;m blonde doesn&apos;t
mean that I&apos;m stupid!!! I may be blonde, but I&apos;m smart, I own my own
business, I&apos;m going on vacation and I absolutely refuse to move from this
seat until this airplane lands in Jamaica!!!&quot;The Co-Pilot felt it was
necessary to notify the Captain.

After the Captain was advised of the situation, he entered the first class
cabin, approached the blonde woman whose face was now red with anger,
leaned over and quietly whispered something into her ear. Without
hesitation, the blonde gathered her belongings from under the seat, stood
up, took her small bag from the overhead compartment and walked to the
rear of the aircraft. She quietly took her assigned seat in the coach
section without another word being said.

The entire flight crew was totally amazed at how the Captain had handled
this situation so quickly and so professionally. The Co-Pilot couldn&apos;t
stand it anymore and finally had to ask,&quot;Sir, what exactly did you
whisper in her ear? Whatever it was, it worked like a charm.&quot;The
Captain smiled smugly and said&quot;I simply informed our passenger that the
front half of the airplane was not going to Jamaica.&quot;

Subject: 71 THINGS TO DO ON AN EXAM WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TOFAIL IT
ANYWAYS!

1. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming&quot;Andre, Andre, I&apos;ve
got the secret documents!!&quot;

2. Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud,
debate your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop,
yell out,&quot;I&apos;m SOOO sure that you can hear me thinking.&quot;Then
start talking about what a jerk the instructor is.

 Bring a Game Boy. Play with the volume at max level. On the answer sheet find a new, interesting way to refuse to 


answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this
question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious
beliefs. Be creative.

5. Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a
sigh of relief. Go to the instructor, say&quot;They&apos;ve found me, I
have to leave the country&quot;and run off.

6. 15 min. into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into
very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out&quot;Merry
Christmas.&quot;If you&apos;re really daring, ask for another copy of the
exam. Say you lost the first one. Repeat this process every 15
min.

7. Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on
your head, and nothing else.

8. Come down with a BAD case of Tourette&apos;s Syndrome during the
exam. Be as vulgar as possible.

9. Bring things to throw at the instructor when she&apos;s not
looking. Blame it on the person nearest to you.

 As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it. Every 5 min. stand up, collect all your things, move to 


another seat, continue with the exam.

12. Turn in the exam approx. 30 min. into it. As you walk out,
start commenting on how easy it was.

13. Get the exam. 20 min into it, throw your papers down
violently, scream out&quot;Screw this!&quot;and walk out triumphantly.

14. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (ie. Threaten the
instructor that whether or not everyone&apos;s done, they are all
leaving after one hour to go drink.)

15. Show up completely drunk (completely drunk means at some
point during the exam, you should start crying for mommy).

 Comment on how good the instructor is looking that day. Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 min, 


put on a white mask and start yelling&quot;I&apos;m here, the phantom of
the opera&quot;until they drag you away.

18. If the exam is math/sciences related, make up the longest
proofs you could possible think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers
into most equations. If it is a written exam, relate everything
to your own life story.

 Try to get people in the room to do a wave. Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next 


to you. Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice.

21. During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks,
chairs, anything you can reach.

 Puke into your exam booklet. Hand it in. Leave. Take 6 packages of rice cakes to the exam. Stuff at least 2 


rice cakes into your mouth at once. Chew, then cough. Repeat if
necessary.

25. Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About 5 min into it, loudly
say to the instructor,&quot;I don&apos;t understand ANY of this. I&apos;ve
been to every lecture all semester long! What&apos;s the deal? And
who the hell are you? Where&apos;s the regular guy?&quot;

26. Do the entire exam in another language. If you don&apos;t know
one, make one up!

27. Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and
answers completely blacked out.

28. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor
asks why, tell him/her in a very derogatory tone,&quot;the light bulb
that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a
clapper. DUH!&quot;

29. From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy.
Ignore the instructor&apos;s requests for you to stop. When they
finally get you to leave one way or another, begin whistling the
theme to the Bridge on the River Kwai.

30. After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to
any question, ask for the answer. Try to work it out of him/her.

Next section submitted by Jeremy Willis

 Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last minutes. Wake up, say&quot;oh geez, better get cracking&quot;and do 


some gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early.

32. If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is
long answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be
creative. Use the integral symbol.

33. Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the
instructor&apos;s left nostril.

 Bring cheerleaders. Bring pets. Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers. Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to 


be taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the
instructor to let them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor
to expect a percentage of the profits if they are allowed to
stay.

38. Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and
true/false. If it is a multiple choice exam, spell out
interesting things (DCCAB. BABE. etc..).

39. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the
instructor that whether or not everyone&apos;s done, they are all
leaving after one hour to go drink)

40. Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you
know the class is very small, and the instructor would recognize
you if you belonged. Claim that you have been to every lecture.
Fight for your right to take the exam.

41. Upon receiving the exam, look it over, while laughing
loudly, say&quot;you don&apos;t really expect me to waste my time on this
drivel? Days of our Lives is on!!!&quot;

 Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said. Start a brawl in the middle of the exam. Bring a friend to give you a back massage the entire way 


through the exam. Insist this person is needed, because you have
bad circulation.

45. Bring cheat sheets FOR ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is
obvious... like history notes for a calculus exam... otherwise
you&apos;re not just failing, you&apos;re getting kicked out too) and
staple them to the exam, with the comment&quot;Please use the
attached notes for references as you see fit.&quot;

 When you walk in, complain about the heat. Strip. Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around 


like they do before concerts start.

 Play frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room. Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, 


etc... sent to you every few minutes throughout the exam.

50. During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks,
chairs, anything you can reach.

51. Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards
at a 90 degree angle.

52. Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If
you are asked to stop, say&quot;it helps me think.&quot;Bring a copy of
the Student Handbook with you, challenging the instructor to find
the section on musical instruments during finals. Don&apos;t forget to
use the phrase&quot;Told you so&quot;.

53. Answer the exam with the&quot;Top Ten Reasons Why Professor xxxx
Sucks&quot;

54. Make Strange noises... get people to stare... look at the
person next to you as if he\she did it.

55. Write a short story about your childhood, or an experience
that you once had. If you can&apos;t think of anything, make something
up. Be creative. End the story with&quot;I just thought I should tell
you.&quot;

56. Wear a mask or costume, pretend that you really DO think
that you&apos;re someone else.

 Play loud music. When you turn in your test, take all the ones under it and 


throw them away or keep them or put your name on some of them.
Do it casually, as if that&apos;s what you are supposed to do after an
exam.

 Dress like the professor. Cross-Dress. Borrow a friend&apos;s Video taping equipment and set up a lot of 


lights and a camera around your desk. Call out instructions to
imaginary people who are supposed to be working the equipment.

 Two words: Plastic Explosives. Bring food or Drinks, pass them out to the class as if 


you&apos;re supposed to be giving samples for a fund raiser. Use the
words&quot;Would you buy something like this if we had a bake sale?&quot;
It doesn&apos;t matter if they are baked goods or not.

 Trip people as they walk by your desk. Read all the questions out loud like Rain Man. Walk around the room and ask people if there is anything 


that you can help them with. Speak loudly stutter and spit. Make
a show of it.

67. Make several origami animals out of the test papers.
Re-enact scenes from your favorite soap opera with them.

68. In the middle of the test, have a friend rush into the
classroom, tag your hand, and resume taking your test for you.
When the teacher asks what&apos;s going on, calmly explain the rules
of Tag Team Testing to him/her.

 Use Invisible Ink to answer the whole exam. Order catering. The catering company should come in about 


halfway through the test, and should include at least three
waiters, eight carts of food, and five candelabras.

71. Stand up after about 15 minutes, and say loudly,&quot;Okay,
let&apos;s double-check our answers! Number one, A. Number two, C.
Number three, E....&quot;

Subject: WOMEN SPEAK IN ESTROGEN AND MEN LISTEN IN TESTOSTERONE

RELATIONSHIPS
When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her
heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem
titled&quot;All Men Are Idiots&quot;. Then she will get on with her
life. A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months
after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will
call and say,&quot;I just wanted to let you know you ruined my
life, and I&apos;ll never forgive you, and I hate you. But I want
you to know that there&apos;s always a chance for us.&quot;This is known
as the&quot;I Hate You / I Love You&quot;drunken phone call, and 99% of
all men have made one at least once. There are community colleges
that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas, these
classes rarely prove effective.


MATURITY
Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can
function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading
baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class.
This is why high school romances rarely work out.

HANDWRITING
To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just
chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they
dot their&quot;i&apos;s&quot;with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously
large oops in their&quot;p&apos;s&quot;and&quot;g&apos;s&quot;. It is a royal pain to read a
note from a woman. Even when she&apos;s dumping you, she&apos;ll put a smiley
face at the end of the note.

COMEDY
Let&apos;s say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching
television, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on.
Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh
uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly,
man&apos;s favorite Stooge. The women will roll their eyes and
groan and wait it out.

BATHROOMS
A man has six items in his bathroom -- a toothbrush, shaving cream,
razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The
average number of items in the typical woman&apos;s bathroom is 437.
A man would not be able to identify most of these items.

GROCERIES
A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the
store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left
in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery
shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man
reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the
Clampett&apos;s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not
stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.

SHOES
When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit,
then slip on Reebok sneakers. She wil carry her dress shoes in a
plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on
her dress shoes. Five minutes later, she will kick them off because
her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes
all day.

GOING OUT
When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go
out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL
be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings, finishes
putting on her makeup...

CATS
Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren&apos;t
looking, men kick cats.

OFFSPRING
Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows
about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and
best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes
and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people
living in the house.

DRESSING UP
A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants,
empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail.
A man will dress up for weddings, funerals.

DAVID LETTERMAN
Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the
Earth. Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always
has a bad haircut.

LAUNDRY
Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article
of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about
eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally
out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a
U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always
expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth
perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of&quot;Love, American Style.&quot;

WEDDINGS
When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about&quot;the ceremony&quot;.
Men talk about&quot;the bachelor party&quot;.

SOCKS
Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweat socks.
Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles,
that have pictures of clouds, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.


EATING OUT
and when the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each
throw in $20 bills, even though it&apos;s only for $22.50. None of
them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit
they want change back. When the women get their check, out
come the pocket calculators.

MIRRORS
Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror.
Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections
in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows,
Joe Garagiola&apos;s head.

MENOPAUSE
When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of
complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes.
The nature and degree of these changes varies with the individual.
Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction -- he buys aviator
glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes
shopping for a Porsche.

THE TELEPHONE
Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone
to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her
girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call
the same friend and they will talk for three hours.

DIRECTIONS
If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar
surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions.
Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men wil never stop and
ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while
saying things like,&quot;Looks like I&apos;ve found a new way to get there.&quot;
and,&quot;I know I&apos;m in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11
store.&quot;

ADMITTING MISTAKES
Women will sometimes admit making a mistake. The last man who
admitted he was wrong was General George Custer.

RICHARD GERE
Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way.
Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick
guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.

MADONNA
Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.

TOYS
Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the
age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their
obsession withtoys. As they get older, their toys simply become
more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men&apos;s toys:
little miniature TV&apos;s, Car phones, Complicated juicers and blenders,
Graphic equalizers, Small robots that serve cocktails on command,
Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6&quot;D&quot;
batteries to operate.

PLANTS
A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The
man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to
an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.

CAMERAS
Men take photography very seriously. They&apos;ll shell out $4000 for
state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography
classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics. Of course, women always
end up taking better pictures.

GARAGES
Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men
use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages,
they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in
garages.

MOVIES
Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.
This is because every movie in the history of movies has been
produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in
the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him.

JEWELRY
Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with
wearing one ring and that&apos;s it. Any more than that and he will
look like a lounge singer named Vic.

SPORT ARENAS
Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas.
The women usually end up following men.

TIME
When a woman says she&apos;ll be ready to go out in five more minutes,
she&apos;s using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football
games&apos;s just got five minutes left. Neither of them is counting
time outs, commercials, or replays.

CONVERSATION
Men need a good disagreement to get talking, e.g.,&quot;Wow, great
movie.&quot;,&quot;What are you, nuts? No REAL cop would have an Uzi that size.&quot;,
&quot;Well, maybe he got it because he knew about those Mafia guys&quot;, etc.
Women,not having this problem, try to initiate conversations with men by
saying something agreeable&quot;That garden by the roadside looks lovely.&quot;
&quot;Mmhmm.&quot;Pause.&quot;That was a good restaurant last night, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;Pause. And so on.

FRIENDS
Women on a girls&apos; night out talk the whole time. Men on a boys&apos; night
out say about twenty words all night, most of which are
&quot;Pass the Doritos&quot;or&quot;Got any more beer?&quot;

RESTROOMS
Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms
as social lounges. Men in restrooms will never speak a word to
each other. Women who&apos;ve never met will leave a restroom giggling
together like old friends.

 


Subject: Isn&apos;t it ironic, don&apos;t you think?

A fierce gust of wind blew 45-year-old Vittorio Luise&apos;s car into a river
near Naples, Italy, in 1983. He managed to break a window, climb out and
swim to shore - where a tree blew over and killed him.

Mike Stewart, 31, of Dallas was filming a movie in 1983 on the dangers of
low-level bridges when the truck he was standing on passed under a
low-level bridge - killing him.

Walter Hallas, a 26-year-old store clerk in Leeds, England, was so
afraid of dentists that in 1979 he asked a fellow worker to try to cure
his toothache by punching him in the jaw. The punch caused Hallas to fall
down, hitting his head, and he died of a fractured skull.

George Schwartz, owner of a factory in Providence, R.I., narrowly
escaped death when a 1983 blast flattened his factory except for one
wall. After treatment for minor injuries, he returned to the scene to
search for files. The remaining wall then collapsed on him, killing him.

Depressed since he could not find a job, 42-year-old Romolo Ribolla
sat in his kitchen near Pisa, Italy, with a gun in his hand threatening
to kill himself in 1981. His wife pleaded for him not to do it, and after
about an hour he burst into tears and threw the gun to the floor. It
went off and killed his wife.

In 1983, a Mrs. Carson of Lake Kushaqua, N.Y., was laid out in her
coffin, presumed dead of heart disease. As mourners watched, she
suddenly sat up. Her daughter dropped dead of fright.

A man hit by a car in New York in 1977 got up uninjured, but lay back
down in front of the car when a bystander told him to pretend he was
hurt so he could collect insurance money. The car rolled forward and
crushed him to death.

Subject: What comes down must have gone up?

A Programmer and an Engineer are sitting next to each other on a long
flight
from LA to NY. The Programmer leans over to the Engineer and asks if he
would
like to play a fun game. The Engineer just wants to take a nap, so he
politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.

The Programmer persists and explains that the game is real easy and a lot
of
fun. He explains,&quot;I ask you a question, and if you don&apos;t know the answer,
you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don&apos;t know the answer,
I&apos;ll pay you $5.&quot;

Again, the Engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep.

The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says,&quot;OK, if you don&apos;t know the
answer you pay me $5, and if I don&apos;t know the answer, I&apos;ll pay you $50!&quot;

This catches the Engineer&apos;s attention, and he sees no end to this torment
unless he plays, so he agrees to the game. The Programmer asks the first
question,&quot;What&apos;s the distance from the earth to the moon?&quot;

The Engineer doesn&apos;t say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a
$5
bill, and hands it to the Programmer.

Now, it&apos;s the Engineer&apos;s turn. He asks the Programmer,&quot;What goes up a hill
with three legs and comes down with four?&quot;

The Programmer looks at him puzzled. He takes out his laptop computer and
searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem
and
searches the Net and the Library of Congress.

Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his coworkers--all to no avail.

After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. The Engineer
politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep.

The Programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks,
&quot;Well, so what&apos;s the answer?&quot;

Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Programmer
$5, and turns away to get back to sleep.

Subject: How I Got Into Heaven

&gt;&gt;How I Got Into Heaven...
&gt;&gt;
 

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it
&gt;&gt;had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one,
&gt;&gt;&quot;Heaven&apos;s getting pretty close to full today, and I&apos;ve been asked to
admit
&gt;&gt;only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what&apos;s your
&gt;&gt;story?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So the first man replies:&quot;Well, for a while I&apos;ve suspected my wife has
&gt;&gt;been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her
&gt;&gt;red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell
something
&gt;&gt;was wrong, but all my searching around didn&apos;t reveal where this other guy
&gt;&gt;could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure
&gt;&gt;enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above
ground!
&gt;&gt;By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but
&gt;&gt;wouldn&apos;t you know it, he wouldn&apos;t fall off. So finally I went back into
my
&gt;&gt;apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of
&gt;&gt;course, he couldn&apos;t stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but
even
&gt;&gt;after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn&apos;t
&gt;&gt;stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw
&gt;&gt;it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all
the
&gt;&gt;stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on
the
&gt;&gt;balcony.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,&quot;said Peter, and let the man
in.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being
full,
&gt;&gt;and again asks for his story.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;It&apos;s been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my
&gt;&gt;apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my
balcony.
&gt;&gt;Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over
&gt;&gt;the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the
&gt;&gt;floor below me. I knew I couldn&apos;t hang on for very long, when suddenly
this
&gt;&gt;man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he
&gt;&gt;started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he
&gt;&gt;ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my
&gt;&gt;hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the
&gt;&gt;bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going
&gt;&gt;to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me
&gt;&gt;instantly, and now I&apos;m here.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible
&gt;&gt;death.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process
&gt;&gt;was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his
story.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Picture this,&quot;says the third man,&quot;I&apos;m hiding naked inside a
&gt;&gt;refrigerator...&quot;

Subject: Cockroach Story

Subject: cockroach storyqqqSubject: cockroach story

Once upon a time...there was a man called Phil. Every night, Phil
went to the store, bought six cans of beer and went home to drink
them in front of his TV.

One night, after his 6th can, the doorbell rang. Phil staggers out
and opens the door. Outside on the porch is a 6&apos; tall cockroach.
Phil is stunned, but is frankly astonished when the cockroach elbows
its way into the hall, grabs Phil by the neck and throws him halfway
up the stairs. When Phil comes around, the cockroach is gone and he
puts the pain down to too much beer.

The next night, Phil has just finished his 4th can of beer when the
doorbell rings again. He staggers (slightly less) to the door and
there outside is the 6&apos; cockroach again. It punches him in the head,
kicks him in the ankle and again, when Phil regains consciousness,
it&apos;s gone.

The third night, after only two cans of beer, the doorbell rings.
Phil opens the door again (almost sober), and the cockroach is there
again. It hits him with a baseball bat, bites him on the arm and
kicks both his kneecaps. Again it vanishes.

Worried by now, Phil vows not to drink again and is therefore
surprised when the next night, utterly sober, he has the living
daylights beaten out of him by this 6&apos; cockroach on the doorstep.

Phil goes to the doctor and he explains what has been happening and
the doctor listens.&quot;Doctor,&quot;he cries,&quot;What&apos;s the matter with me?&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot;the doctor reassures him.&quot;There&apos;s just a nasty bug
going around.&quot;


Subject: The Castaway Engineer

A rather inhibited engineer finally splurged on a luxury cruise to the
Caribbean. It was the&quot;craziest&quot;thing he had ever done in his life.

Just as he was beginning to enjoy himself, a hurricane roared upon the
huge ship, capsizing it like a child&apos;s toy. Somehow the engineer,
desperately hanging on to a life preserver, managed to wash ashore on a
secluded island.

Outside of beautiful scenery, a spring-fed pool, bananas and coconuts,
there was little else. He lost all hope and for hours on end, sat under
same palm tree. One day, after several months had passed, a gorgeous
woman in a small rowboat appeared.

&quot;I&apos;m from the other side of the island,&quot;she said.&quot;Were you on the
cruise ship, too?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I was,&quot;he answered.&quot;But where did you get that rowboat?&quot;

&quot;Well, I whittled the oars from gum tree branches, wove the reinforced
gunnel from palm branches, and made the keel and stern from a Eucalyptus
tree.&quot;

&quot;But, what did you use for tools?&quot;asked the man.

&quot;There was a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed on the south
side of the island. I discovered that if I fired it to a certain
temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. Anyhow,
that&apos;s how I got the tools. But, enough of that,&quot;she said.&quot;Where have
you been living all this time? I don&apos;t see any shelter.&quot;

&quot;To be honest, I&apos;ve just been sleeping on the beach,&quot;he said.

&quot;Would you like to come to my place?&quot;the woman asked. The engineer
nodded dumbly.

She expertly rowed them around to her side of the island, and tied up the
boat with a handsome strand of hand-woven hemp topped with a neat back
splice. They walked up a winding stone walk she had laid and around a
palm tree. There stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

&quot;It&apos;s not much, but I call it home.&quot;Inside, she said,&quot;Sit down please.
Would you like to have a drink?&quot;

&quot;No, thanks,&quot;said the man.&quot;One more coconut juice and I&apos;ll throw up!&quot;

&quot;It won&apos;t be coconut juice,&quot;the woman replied.&quot;I have a crude still
out back, so we can have authentic Pina Coladas.&quot;

Trying to hide his amazement, the man accepted the drink, and they sat
down on her couch to talk. After they had exchanged stories, the woman
asked,&quot;Tell me, have you always had a beard?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot;the man replied,&quot;I was clean shaven all of my life until I ended
up on this island.&quot;

&quot;Well if you&apos;d like to shave, there&apos;s a razor upstairs in the bathroom
cabinet.&quot;

The man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom
and shaved with an intricate bone-and-shell device honed razor sharp.
Next he showered -- not even attempting to fathom a guess as to how she
managed to get warm water into the bathroom -- and went back downstairs.
He couldn&apos;t help but admire the masterfully carved banister as he walked.

&quot;You look great,&quot;said the woman.&quot;I think I&apos;ll go up and slip into
something more comfortable.&quot;

As she did, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time,
the woman, smelling faintly of gardenias, returned wearing a revealing
gown fashioned out of pounded palm fronds.

&quot;Tell me,&quot;she asked,&quot;we&apos;ve both been out here for a very long time with
no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely...is there
anything that you really, really miss? Something that all men and woman
need? Something that would be really nice to have right now!&quot;

&quot;Yes there is!&quot;the man replied, shucking off his shyness.&quot;There is
something I&apos;ve wanted to do for so long. But on this island all alone, it
was just...well, it was impossible.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&apos;s not impossible, any more,&quot;the woman said.

The man, practically panting in excitement, said breathlessly:&quot;You mean
you actually figured out some way we can check our e-mail here?&quot;

Subject: The Flood

Mr. Smith was a good man who had a house close to the river. Some heavy
rains came, and the river started rising. Mr. Smith wasn&apos;t concerned,
even when the street in front of his house was about two feet under water.

The local fire department took a big truck up the street, rescuing anyone
stranded in their homes. Mr. Smith wasn&apos;t leaving, though.&quot;I&apos;m a good
church-going man, and I don&apos;t believe that God will let me be harmed.&quot;
The fire department kept on going.

The flood waters rose, forcing Mr. Smith up to the second story of his
house. The sheriff came by in a boat, offering to help Mr. Smith onto dry
land.&quot;No, thanks&quot;, he said.&quot;I&apos;m a good church-going man, and I don&apos;t
believe that God will let me be harmed.&quot;The sheriff couldn&apos;t remove him,
and so kept on going.

The rain kept falling, and the river rose even more. Mr. Smith is
standing on the roof of his house, holding on to the chimney so he won&apos;t
be swept away. The water is almost up to his neck when a state police
helicopter flies to him.&quot;Mr. Smith, grab the rope and let us rescue
you! We don&apos;t want you to drown!&quot;&quot;I&apos;m a good church-going man, and I
don&apos;t believe that God will let me be harmed. Go rescue somebody who
really needs it.&quot;The helicopter flew away into the darkness.

The waters rose even more. Finally Mr. Smith lost his grip on the chimney
and drowned in the churning waters.

When he got to Heaven, Mr. Smith demanded an audience with God. When he
was shown into the throne room, he was very insistent:

&quot;God, I just died in a flood down on Earth. I didn&apos;t believe that You
would let me be harmed. I thought You were going to rescue me!&quot;

&quot;Mr. Smith, I tried three times!&quot;


Subject: Top 10 Drug Using Cartoon Suspects

&gt;&gt;&gt;Top Ten Drug Using Cartoon Suspects:
&gt;&gt;&gt;When you think of all the crap we watched on TV as kids, you start to
&gt;&gt;&gt;realize we are such a twisted generation because of the twisted
&gt;&gt;&gt;animators behind our favorite cartoons. Just a small reminder of what
&gt;&gt;&gt;we were subjected to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;10. Gargamel (From the Smurfs)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Most likely LSD. Spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in
&gt;&gt;&gt;sissy white outfits and mentally abusing his cat. What does he plan to
&gt;&gt;&gt;do with the blue dwarfs when he catches them anyway?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;9. Olive Oyl
&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines. Who is that skinny?!
&gt;&gt;&gt;She might even be anorexic, she is always giving her burger to her
&gt;&gt;&gt;friend. One side question, what the hell are Popeye and Brutus
&gt;&gt;&gt;thinking?
&gt;&gt;&gt;What is it - her personality? NOT!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;8. Snagglepuss
&gt;&gt;&gt;Can&apos;t explain it. Maybe it&apos;s the name, or the look, but he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;suspicious.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;7. He-Man
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is an easy one. I mean c&apos;mon. Roid monkey #1.&quot;BY THE POWER OF
&gt;&gt;&gt;ANABOL!!!!!!&quot;Makes me want to root for Skeletor. Alone in his castle,
&gt;&gt;&gt;hitting the weights. And on top of that he even injects the $#@ ! in
his
&gt;&gt;&gt;pet tiger. Can we say&quot;Animal Abuse&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;6.&amp;5. Yogi and Boo Boo
&gt;&gt;&gt;We all know what is really in those picnic baskets. They go back to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the cave and trip. Another side ? - Are they gay? I mean, take a
look at
&gt;&gt;&gt;BooBoo. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.....
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;4. Droopy
&gt;&gt;&gt;The number one downer abuser in toon land. Can&apos;t someone slip him an
&gt;&gt;&gt;upper every year or two. The only time I ever saw him happy is when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;sees the picture of the babe. Sort of makes you wonder.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Dopey Dwarf
&gt;&gt;&gt;He openly admits it. The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;under investigation. Allegations are that Doc is writing some extra
&gt;&gt;&gt;scripts for Sneezy and all the guys partaking are afloat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Daffy Duck
&gt;&gt;&gt;If he isn&apos;t using crack, Marion Barry is clean. He is so wired he
&gt;&gt;&gt;bounces around on his head without pain. Blows his beak off all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;time. Some symptoms might be from&quot;daffiness&quot;but Haldol wouldn&apos;t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;for him.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Shaggy from Scooby Doo
&gt;&gt;&gt;By far the #1 suspect. His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee, the boy
&gt;&gt;&gt;converses with dogs. But all of this is nothing until you go to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Munchie Factor. Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per
&gt;&gt;&gt;episode does pot no if, ands, or, buts about it. And look at the way
&gt;&gt;&gt;him and his friends painted that van! Pretty rad design dude.


Subject: engineers in hell

An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his
dossier and says,&quot;Ah, you&apos;re an engineer -- you&apos;re in the wrong place.&quot;
So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty
soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell,
and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they&apos;ve
got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer
is a pretty popular guy. One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and
says with a sneer,&quot;So, how&apos;s it going down there in hell?&quot;Satan
replies,&quot;Hey, things are going great. We&apos;ve got air conditioning and
flush toilets and escalators, and there&apos;s no telling what this engineer
is going to come up with next.&quot;God replies,&quot;What??? You&apos;ve got an
engineer? That&apos;s a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there;
send him up here.&quot;
Satan says,&quot;No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I&apos;m
keeping him.&quot;God says,&quot;Send him back up here or I&apos;ll sue.&quot;Satan
laughs uproariously and answers,&quot;Yeah, right. And just where are YOU
going to get a lawyer?&quot;

 

Subject: The Seven Deadly Sins of Gilligan&apos;s Island

The Seven Deadly Sins of Gilligan&apos;s Island theory is quite simple. Each
of the
seven characters on the island represents each of the seven deadly sins.
Now,
this theory seems to fit upon initial inspection, but there are technical
difficulties
when you get down to THE MAN himself, Gilligan.

Run with me on this one...
Most obvious is the Professor, who fits PRIDE to a T. Any man who can
make a
ham radio out of some wire and two coconuts has to be pretty cocky. (His
character
was later revised and given a series of his own, called&quot;MacGuyver&quot;.)

For the sin of ENVY we need look no further than Maryann, who may have
worn those
skimpy little tops, but could never achieve Ginger&apos;s glamour. (As an
interesting and
completely irrelevant side note, a nationwide survey of college students a
few years
ago revealed that the professor and Maryann were voted the most likely
couple to
have &apos;done it&apos; on the island.)

And who could doubt for a moment that Ginger is LUST incarnate? Sure, the
kids were
supposed to think she was ACTING, but we all know what being deprived
episode after
episode was doing to her. You know and I know that glazed look wasn&apos;t
boredom, my
friends.

What kind of person takes a trunk full of money on a three-hour cruise?
Mr. Howell gets my
vote for GREED. We are now left with three characters and three Deadly
Sins.

We have Gilligan, the Skipper and Mrs. Howell to whom we must match
GLUTTONY, SLOTH
and ANGER. As you can see, there is a Gilligan problem here. Certainly
we can further eliminate
Mrs. Howell from this equation by connecting her with SLOTH. She did jack
 $#@ ! during her many
years on the island and everybody knows it.

This leaves ANGER and GLUTTONY, either of which the Skipper had no
shortage. He was,
after all, a big guy with the tendency to hit Gilligan with his hat at
least once an episode. After
much consideration, I have decided that he can easily do double-duty,
covering the two
remaining Deadly Sins.

So here we have the Seven Deadly Sins trapped in an endlessly recurring
Hell of hope
followed by denial and despair, forced to live with each other in our TVs
until the last
re-run ends.

And who is their captor? What keeps them trapped there? Gilligan.

Gilligan is SATAN. Think about it.

 

Subject: Performance Reviews - British Officers

The British Military requires annual officer performance
reviews. These are actual excerpts taken from people&apos;s
reviews....

- His men would follow him anywhere, but only out of curiosity.

- This Officer is really not so much of a has-been, but more of a
definitely-won&apos;t-be.

- When she opens her mouth, it seems that this is only to change
whichever
foot was previously in there.

- He has carried out each and every one of his duties to his entire
satisfaction.

- He would be out of his depth in a car park puddle.

- Technically sound, but socially impossible.

- This Officer reminds me very much of a gyroscope - always spinning
around at a frantic pace, but not really going anywhere.

- This young lady has delusions of adequacy.

- When he joined my ship, this Officer was something of a granny; since
then he has aged considerably.

- This Medical Officer has used my ship to carry his genitals from port
to
port, and my officers to carry him from bar to bar.

- Since my last report he has reached rock bottom, and has started to
dig.

- She sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve
them.

- He has the wisdom of youth, and the energy of old age.

- This Officer should go far - and the sooner he starts, the better.

- In my opinion, this pilot should not be authorized to fly below 250
feet.

- This man is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.

45 year-old Amy Brasher was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, after
a mechanic reported to police that 18 packages of marijuana were
packed in the compartment of the car which she had brought to
mechanic for an oil change. According to police, Brasher later
said that she didn&apos;t realize that mechanic would have to raise the
hood to change the oil.

Portsmouth, R.I. Police charged Gregory Rosa, 25, with a string of
vending machine robberies in January when he (1) fled from police
inexplicably when they spotted him loitering around a vending
machine and (2) later tried to post his $400 bail in coins.

Karen Lee Joachimmi, 20, was arrested in Lake City, Florida for
robbery of a Howard Johnson&apos;s motel. She was armed with only an
electric chain saw, which was not plugged in.

The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a
Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 7:50am flashed a gun and

man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren&apos;t available for
breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.

David Posman, 33, was arrested recently in Providence, R.I, after
allegedly knocking out an armored car driver and stealing the
closest four bags of money. It turned out they contained $800 in
PENNIES, weighed 30 pounds each, and slowed him to a stagger
during his getaway so that police officers easily jumped him from
behind.

Subject: DARWIN AWARD WINNER FOR 1997 ANNOUNCED

You all know about the Darwin Awards - It&apos;s an annual honor given to
the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing
themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way The 1995 winner was
the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top
of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. In 1996 the
winner was an air force sergeant who attached a jet engine (JATO) unit
to his car and crashed into a cliff several hundred feet above the
road.

And now, the 1997 winner:
Larry Waters of Los Angeles-one of the few Darwin winners to survive
his award-winning accomplishment.
Larry&apos;s boyhood dream was to fly. When he graduated from high school,
he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot. Unfortunately,
poor eyesight disqualified him. When he was finally discharged, he had
to satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard. One day,
Larry, had a bright idea. He decided to fly. He went to the local
Army-Navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and several
tanks of helium. The weather balloons, when fully inflated, would
measure more than four feet across. Back home, Larry securely strapped
the balloons to his sturdy lawn chair. He anchored the chair to the
bumper of his jeep and inflated the balloons with the helium. He
climbed on for a test while it was still only a few feet above the
ground. Satisfied it would work, Larry packed several sandwiches and a
six- pack of Miller Lite, loaded his pellet gun-figuring he could pop
a few balloons when it was time to descend-and went back to the
floating lawn chair. He tied himself in along with his pellet gun and
provisions. Larry&apos;s plan was to lazily float up to a height of about 30
feet above his back yard after severing the anchor and in a few hours
come back down.

Things didn&apos;t quite work out that way.
When he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep, he didn&apos;t
float lazily up to 30 or so feet. Instead he streaked into the LA sky
as if shot from a cannon. He didn&apos;t level of at 30 feet, nor did he
level off at 100 feet. After climbing and climbing, he leveled off at
11,000 feet. At that height he couldn&apos;t risk shooting any of the
balloons, lest he unbalance the load and really find himself in
trouble. So he stayed there, drifting, cold and frightened, for more
than 14 hours. Then he really got in trouble. He found himself
drifting into the primary approach corridor of Los Angeles
International Airport. A United pilot first spotted Larry. He radioed
the tower and described passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun.
Radar confirmed the existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above
the airport. LAX emergency procedures swung into full alert and a
helicopter was dispatched to investigate. LAX is right on the ocean.
Night was falling and the offshore breeze began to flow. It carried
Larry out to sea with the helicopter in hot pursuit. Several miles
out, the helicopter caught up with Larry. Once the crew determined that
Larry was not dangerous, they attempted to close in for a rescue but
the draft from the blades would push Larry away whenever they
neared. Finally, the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred
feet above Larry and lowered a rescue line. Larry snagged the line and
was hauled back to shore. The difficult maneuver was flawlessly
executed by the helicopter crew. As soon as Larry was hauled to earth,
he was arrested by waiting members of the LAPD for violating LAX
airspace.

As he was led away in handcuffs, a reporter dispatched to cover the
daring rescue asked why he had done it. Larry stopped, turned and
replied nonchalantly,&quot;A man can&apos;t just sit around.&quot;

Let&apos;s hear it for Larry Waters, the 1997 Darwin Award Winner.

The next day, the duck walks in to the feed store and asks,&quot;Got any

Next day, the duck walks in, and asks,&quot;Got any duck feed?&quot;The
clerk says,&quot;I&apos;ve told you twice, we don&apos;t have duck feed, we&apos;ve
never had duck feed and we never will have duck feed. If you ask me

Subject: A Good Old-Fashioned Catholic Joke

A ten year old public school boy was finding fifth grade math to be
the challenge of his life. Science? A piece of cake. Geography?
No
big deal. Spelling? Ha! Give me a break . . .but MATH? It was
devastating! To not only him, but his mom and dad, too! And not that
they weren&apos;t doing everything and anything to help their son . .
Private tutors; peer assistance; CD-Roms; Textbooks; even HYPNOSIS!
Nothing worked. Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they
decided to enroll their son in a private school. Not just ANY
private
school, but a Catholic school. Nuns. Weekly mass. The whole
shootin&apos; match . . . .

Well, the first day of school finally arrived, and dressed in his
salt-and-pepper cords and white wool dress shirt and blue cardigan
sweater, the youngster ventured out into the great unknown. His
mother and father were convinced they were doing the right thing . . .

They were both there waiting for their son when he returned home.
And
when he walked in with a stern, focused and very determined
expression
on his face, they hoped they had made the right choice. He walked
right past them AND the table set with a tall glass of cold milk and
warm chocolate chip cookies, and went straight to his room - and
quietly closed the door.

For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books
strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He only emerged
long
enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, he went straight
back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his
studies until bedtime. This pattern continued ceaselessly until it
was time for the first quarter report card . . .

After school, the boy walked into the home with his report card -
unopened - in his hand. Without a word, he dropped the envelope on
the family dinner table and went straight to his room. His parents
were petrified.

What lay inside the envelope? Success? Failure? DOOM?!?

Patiently, cautiously the mother opened the letter, and to her
amazement, she saw a bright red&quot;A&quot;under the subject, MATH.
Overjoyed, she and her husband RUSHED into their son&quot;s room, thrilled
at the remarkable progress of their young son!

&quot;Was it the nuns that did it?&quot;, the father asked. The boy only
nodded,

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?&quot;, asked the
mother.

Again, the boy shrugged,&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;The textbooks? The teacher? The curriculum?&quot;, asked the father.

&quot;Nope,&quot;said the son.&quot;It was all very clear to me from the VERY
FIRST DAY of school, that these folks in Catholic school meant
business!&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot;, asked his mom.

&quot;When I walked into the lobby, and I saw that guy they&apos;d nailed to
the
plus sign, I KNEW they meant business!&quot;

And the Lord said unto Noah:&quot;Where is the Ark which I have commanded

And Noah said unto the Lord:&quot;Verily, I have had three carpenters off

gopher
wood hath been on order nigh upon twelve months. What can I do, O Lord?&quot;

And God said unto Noah:&quot;I want that Ark finished even after seven days

And Noah said:&quot;It will be so.&quot;

And it was not so.

And Noah said unto the Lord:&quot;Mine subcontractor hath gone, alas,
bankrupt. The pitch which thou commandedst me to put on the outside and
the inside of the Ark hath not arrived. The canvas, although on hand, is
not the right color. The pipefitter hath gone on strike. Shem, my son,
who helpeth me on the Ark side of the business, hath formed a rock group
with his brothers Ham and Japheth. Lord, I am undone.&quot;

And the Lord grew angry and said:&quot;And what about the animals, the male
and the female of every sort that I ordered to come unto thee to keep their
seed alive upon the face of the Earth?&quot;

And Noah said:&quot;They have been delivered unto the wrong address but
should arriveth on Friday.&quot;

And the Lord said:&quot;How about the unicorn and the fowls of the air by
sevens?&quot;

And Noah wrung his hands and wept saying:&quot;Lord, unicorns are a
discontinued line, thou canst not get them for love nor money. And fowls
of the air are sold only in half-dozens. The peacocks even then, are on
back order for weeks to come. Lord, Lord, thou knowest how it is.&quot;

The President quickly has a world map brought over and he carefully
points out the affected area of the globe, recounting briefly the
long-standing geopolitical instability of the area.

The genie&apos;s eyes widen and he says&quot;Oh, yea. Now I remember. The
Mideast! Whew. That&apos;s a tough one. You know, they&apos;ve been fighting
over there quite literally for millennia. I hate to admit it, but I
think that&apos;s more than I can handle. I&apos;m sorry. Can you wish for
something else?&quot;

Clinton, obviously crestfallen at such a missed opportunity, can think of
only one other wish:&quot;Could you make the American people like my wife?&quot;

The genie pauses, grimaces, then says,&quot;Let me see that map again.&quot;


Subject: Perfect....

There was a perfect man who met a perfect woman. After a
perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was,
of course, perfect. One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve this perfect couple
was driving along a winding road when they noticed someone at roadside
in distress.
Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood
Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any
children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and
his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along delivering
the toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the
perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of the
passengers survived the accident.
Who was the survivor?? (scroll down for the answer)

Subject: Haircuts - The difference between men and women

Men and women certainly do think differently as illustrated by the
following dialog:
Haircuts - The difference between men and women
Haircuttee - Woman1
Haircut Noticer - Woman2

Woman2: Oh! You got a haircut! That&apos;s so cute!
Woman1: Do you think so? I wasn&apos;t sure when she was gave me the
mirror.
I mean, you don&apos;t think it&apos;s too fluffy looking?
Woman2: Oh God no! No, it&apos;s perfect. I&apos;d love to get my hair cut like
that, but I think my face is too wide. I&apos;m pretty much stuck
with this stuff I think.

Woman1: Are you serious? I think your face is adorable. And you could
easily get one of those layer cuts - that would look so cute I
think. I was actually going to do that except that I was afraid it
would accent my long neck.
Woman2: Oh - that&apos;s funny! I would love to have your neck! Anything
to take
attention away from this two-by-four I have for a shoulder line.

Woman1: Are you kidding? I know girls that would love to have your
shoulders. Everything drapes so well on you. I mean, look at
my arms - see how short they are? If I had your shoulders I could get
clothes to fit me so much easier.
 
 

Haircuttee - Man1
Haircut Noticer - Man2

Man2: Haircut?
Man1: Yeah.


Subject: Clones

A man and his clone were standing at the south rim of the Grand Canyon
enjoying the view when the clone suddenly began to spew forth an unending
stream of vulgarities and obscenities. The man pleaded with him to stop
but the clone redoubled the depravity of his utterances (how do you like
that purple prose!!)

In desperation, the man nudged the clone and he fell over the edge.

A passing park ranger witnessed the event and arrested the man.

The charge?

Subject: Flatulation

An old lady came into her doctor&apos;s office and confessed to an
embarrassing problem:&quot;I fart all the time, Doctor Johnson, but they&apos;re
soundless, and they have no odor. In fact, since I&apos;ve been here, I&apos;ve
farted no less than twenty times. What can I do?&quot;

&quot;Here&apos;s a prescription, Mrs. Barker. Take these pills three times a day
for
seven days and come back and see me in a week.&quot;

The next week, an upset Mrs. Barker marched into Dr. Johnson&apos;s office:
&quot;Doctor, I don&apos;t know what was in those pills, but the problem is worse!
I&apos;m farting just as much, and they&apos;re still soundless, but now they smell
terrible! What do you have to say for yourself?&quot;

&quot;Calm down, Mrs. Barker,&quot;said the doctor soothingly.
&quot;Now that we&apos;ve fixed your sinuses, we&apos;ll work on your hearing.&quot;

 

 

Subject: America Off-Line

Somehow, this doesn&apos;t seem as funny now as I first thought it did...

America Offline

Every day you hear more and more people talking about it. You hear
about it at work, in restaurants, even on the bus. More and more
Americans are discovering how much more free time they have, how much
easier it is to manage their finances and personal&amp;business
relationships. They have discovered the joys of being ...

* * * O F F - L I N E * * *
/\
//\\ Our free software includes utilities to
// \\ seek out and destroy all remnants of
// \\ communications software on your computer
// \\ (also works over a network). It even
// ,-&apos;&apos;-.\\ removes that pesky little winsock.dll
// /&apos;``&apos;. \\\ from your hard drive once and for all!
//.-&apos;:&apos; | |\\ Say good-bye to the World Wide Web and
/// /` / / \\ hello to the friends and family you forgot
jgs //| | ,:-&apos; \\ you had! Our software, once run, remains
// \ &apos;.__,-/ \\ memory-resident, and like a background
// `-...-&apos; \\ virus checker, protects your computer from
//___AMERICA__OFFLINE___\\ re-installation of telecommunications
&apos;
 
 

Here&apos;s how the program works:

1. First you run the good-bye letter generation program that
automatically logs you into all your favorite on-line services and
posts good-bye notes to the news groups and message areas of your
choice. It encourages people to call or even write you if they want to
talk to you, and lets them know that you&apos;re going to be okay, but that
you&apos;re just going offline. (It even logs you into your favorite chat
areas and makes witty parting comments, and leaves requests with
systems administrators to cancel your account.)

2. Our program recognizes every version of every known
communications software package for Mac OS, DOS, Windows, Windows 95,
Windows NT, OS/2 and Unix. It will remove all of these programs and
overwrite your hard drive with null strings so they can&apos;t be
undeleted. And just so you don&apos;t try to sneak in through a back door
-- like an automated check payment window in a program like Quicken
-- our software also removes the serial communications abilities of
all financial and related software.

3. Hardware reconfiguration. Our software alters your system
configuration so that no device that even remotely resembles a modem
or other commun- cations interface will ever work on your computer
again. It installs a&quot;listening program&quot;as a permanent TST so that
even if your computer somehow encounters a modem tone, it will
immediately reboot, thereby keeping you effectively offline, even in
a network environment.

4. Hardware destruction. The next step is to destroy your modems.
This is best done with a hammer. We recommend a hammer because we know
you will start to feel, in that destructive release, the first real
joy of your new life offline. With each crushing blow, we encourage
you to think of the countless hours you&apos;ve wasted, the completely
irrelevant information you have gathered, and the many people who
completely mis-represented themselves to you when you were online.

5. Finally, our software brings you a brief lesson on meditation to
help you begin to relax without being online. It also includes a list
of things that you can do offline, like feeding your cat that you
forgot you had, watering the plants, doing the dishes, seeing your
friends in person, writing notes on pieces of paper, calling your
parents on their birthdays instead of sending e-mail. The list
includes more than 1,000 offline living tips.

We&apos;re sure you&apos;ll agree that this software is the best
of its kind for getting offline quickly...
...and staying that way!

To get your free software, please send a hand-written note to...

(Note from Gare: I nearly fell out of my cube while reading this. People

laughing.)


Cereal
-- by James Lileks

I had a favorite cereal; ate it every morning. One morn I took a look at
the nutritional information and discovered that it was, in essence,
oat-flecked divots of lard. I spent a monkish year choking down Grape
Nuts, which resemble a bowl of rugged BBs, but with less taste. Now I
just eat what&apos;s cheap. This week it&apos;s Frosted Cheerios.

The word&quot;Frosted&quot;on the box guarantees that the sugar is clearly
visible, not hidden, just as the word&quot;Fruit&quot;assures you that several
pieces of fruit-hued putty with Real Fruit Flavor will tumble from the
box, and the word&quot;Fiber&quot;means that the package will have the digestive
effect of consuming a Chore Boy scouring pad.

Of course, I could scorn high cereal prices and buy the store brands with
the cheap graphics. The boxes say things like&quot;if you like Fruit &apos;n&apos;
Fiber, you&apos;ll love Pits &apos;n&apos; Chaff!&quot;&quot;If you like Lucky Charms, you&apos;ll love
Frosted Pixie Gizzards!&quot;If you like&quot;Alpha Bits, you&apos;ll be temporarily
confused by Toasty Random Shapes!&quot;

The cartoon characters on these boxes look like losers who couldn&apos;t get
work with a real cereal. I&apos;m sure the cereals taste fine. But I cannot
bring myself to start the day with Oaty Clown Balls, not when the mascot
leers like John Wayne Gacy on the last few hours of an amphetamine jag.

Actually, I don&apos;t have to commit to a cereal for an entire week just
because I have a coupon. There are single-serve containers: The
Kel-Bowl-Pac. In the 60s, this was a brilliant advance in cereal
technology -- a small single-serving box that doubles as a bowl. It was
like something&quot;Q&quot;division would whip up for James Bond. They came in
groups of four -- Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispees, Sugar Pops, and Special
K, a cereal that has had the flavor scientifically extracted. The weakest
child got the Special K; it was nature&apos;s way.

It takes skill to use a Kel-Bowl-Pac, particularly if you are camping.
You take a knife and cut along the dotted line, puncturing the inner
membrane and plunging the knife into your leg. You now have a small box
of cereal stuck to your thigh. Next step: scream uncontrollably, causing
an adult to quiet your misery by giving you someone else&apos;s Frosted Flakes.
Thus does the weakest child develop a sense of guile. It is nature&apos;s way.

The different between Frosted Flakes and Frosted Cheerios? The Flakes have
a mascot: Tony the Tiger, Mr. Swank, the relaxed old pro, the Arnold
Palmer of the mascot circuit. Sugar Puffs had Sugar Bear -- that Rat-Pack
refugee with the sleepy eyes and the Dean Martin manner, the
spokescreature most likely to be brought up on a morals charge. (His
co-defendant would no doubt be Toucan Sam, the Peter Lawford of cereal
spokesmen.) I always got the feeling that Tony the Tiger would beat Sugar
Bear to a moaning pulp if he got the chance; guys like Sugar Bear must
have bugged Tony. Sugar Bear would have protested the Vietnam War; Tony
would have supported it.

Where Frosted Cheerios stands on the matter of post-colonial Communist
insurrections, I don&apos;t know. I just eat it because it&apos;s cheap. Next week
it goes off sale, though, and I&apos;ll have to find something else. Lucky
Charms, perhaps. Nice and apolitical.

Please don&apos;t tell me the leprechaun was caught running guns to the IRA.

Subject: Dave Letterman&apos;s Lines of the Week Monday, April 7 - Friday, April 11

&quot;I&apos;ll be 50 years old tomorrow and that means, among other things,
that now Bob Dole can start telling jokes about me.&quot;

&quot;I want to tell you though, I&apos;m having the absolute best birthday
ever. Last night -- this was so sweet, it means a great deal to me --
the other cult members got together and they all took me out to see
&apos;Star Wars.&apos;&quot;

&quot;Listen to this, I&apos;m going to have to somehow find a way to convince
the I.R.S. that the $10,000 that I spent on lapdances was a business
expense.&quot;

&quot;They&apos;ve changed that 1040 tax form. Now there&apos;s a box you can check
if you want an Indonesian businessman to give President Clinton
$10,000.&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t realize this, but a lot of your supermodels now are very,
very shy. And they don&apos;t like a lot of the attention of Fashion Week,
you know what I&apos;m saying? For example, earlier today, I saw Kate Moss
at the Fashion Cafe hiding behind a breadstick.&quot;

&quot;Mets pitcher Pete Harnisch is having some trouble. Very mysterious.
Pete Harnisch now suffers from anxiety, having a high level of
anxiety; very, very edgy; and has insomnia, cannot sleep. Medical
experts and doctors are baffled. And I&apos;m thinking, &apos;I wonder if it
has anything to do with that giant Mets logo on his chest.&apos;&quot;

&quot;President Clinton, down there in Washington, D.C., yesterday met
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu said that
President Clinton was frank with him. And I&apos;m thinking, &apos;Oh great,
now the President is using phony names with men as well.&apos;&quot;

&quot;You folks tired of hearing about the Heaven&apos;s Gate cult?...Yeah,
apparently the Heaven&apos;s Gate cult decided it was time to leave
because they were tired of hearing about &apos;Ellen&apos; being gay.&quot;


&quot;Rio D&apos;Angelo was interviewed on &apos;Primetime Live,&apos; and so I tuned it
in, I wanted to see what this was. So I dialed it up and, man, I see
this really scary, very strange, very peculiar looking man with a
very odd look in his eyes and kind of pointy ears -- and then Sam
Donaldson brings out the cult guy and that&apos;s even stranger.&quot;

&quot;You can tell that it&apos;s Daylight Savings Time, can&apos;t you? Man, you
can sure tell here in New York City. This morning, my cab driver set
his meter ahead $10.&quot;

&quot;A thousand days left to New Year&apos;s 2000, which means just about now,
I guess Dick Clark should be going into makeup.&quot;


Subject: Parrots for Sale

Customer in a pet store:

Customer: I want to buy a parrot. What do you have?

Shop Keeper: We have three parrots for sale. The first one is $500.

Customer: That&apos;s pretty expensive. Why is it so much?

Shop Keeper: This bird is $500 because it can run your computer.

Customer: That&apos;s pretty amazing. What about this other bird?

Shop Keeper: That bird is $1000.

Customer: Wow, $1000 is a lot for a bird. What can it do?

Shop Keeper: This bird knows everything the first bird does, plus it
can run Unix operating system.

Customer: That&apos;s amazing. I&apos;ve never seen a bird that can do that.
What about the third bird?

Shop Keeper: This bird is $2000.

Customer: $2000. That&apos;s outrageous! Why so much? What can it do?

Shop Keeper: Well, to tell you the truth, I&apos;ve never seen it do a
damn thing, but the other two parrots call it boss.

 


Subject: Hacker Barbie

(LA, California) Mattel announces their new line of Barbie products, the
&quot;Hacker Barbie.&quot;These new dolls will be released next month. The aim of
these
dolls is to negate the stereotype that women are numerophobic,
computer-illiterate, and academically challenged.

This new line of Barbie dolls comes equipped with Barbie&apos;s very own
X-terminal
and UNIX documentation as well as ORA&apos;s&quot;In a Nutshell&quot;series. The
Barbie
clothing includes a dirty button-up shirt and a pair of well-worn jeans.
Accessories include a Casio all-purpose watch, and glasses with lenses
thick
enough to set ants on fire. (Pocket protectors and HP calculators
optional.)

The new Barbie has the incredible ability to stare at the screen without
blinking her eyes and to go without eating or drinking for 16 hours
straight.
Her vocabulary mainly consists of technical terms such as&quot;What&apos;s your
Internet
address?&quot;,&quot;I like TCP/IP!&quot;,&quot;Bummer! Your kernel must have gotten
trashed,&quot;
&quot;Can&apos;t you grep that file?&quot;, and&quot;DEC&apos;s Alpha AXP is awesome!&quot;

&quot;We are very excited about this product,&quot;said Ken Olsen, Marketing
Executive,
&quot;and we hope that the Hacker Barbie will offset the damage incurred by
the
mathophobic Barbie.&quot;(A year ago, Mattel released Barbie dolls that say,
&quot;Math
is hard,&quot;with a condescending companion Ken.) The Hacker Barbie&apos;s Ken
is an
incompetent management consultant who frequently asks Barbie for help.

The leading feminists are equally excited about this new line of Barbie
dolls.
Naomi Falodji says,&quot;I believe that these new dolls will finally
terminate the
notion that womyn are inherently inferior when it comes to mathematics
and the
sciences. However, I feel that Ken&apos;s hierarchical superiority would
simply
reinforce the patriarchy and oppress the masses.&quot;Mattel made no
comment.

Parents, however, are worried that they will fall behind the children
technologically when the Hacker Barbie comes out.&quot;My daughter Jenny
plays
with
the prototype Hacker Barbie for two days,&quot;says Mrs. Mary Carlson of
rural
Oxford, Mississippi,&quot;and now she pays my credit card bill online. Got
no idea
how she does it, but she surely does it. I just don&apos;t wanna be looked
upon as
some dumb mama.&quot;Mattel will be offering free training courses for those
who
purchase the Hacker Barbie.

The future Hacker Barbie will include several variations to deal with
the
complex aspects of Barbie.&quot;Hacker Barbie Goes to Jail&quot;will teach
computer
ethics to youngsters, while&quot;BARBIE RITES L1KE BIFF!!!&quot;will serve as an
introduction to expository writing.

(Love the above disclaimer. Sigh. Political Correctness assails us from
all sides. I, personally, have more important things in life to worry
about than getting riled up about a humor posting. My condolences to Scott
for having to deal with this stuff.)

Some Boeing employees recently&quot;liberated&quot;a life raft from one of the 747s
on the company&apos;s production line. Later, they took it for a float on the
Stilliguamish river. Imagine their surprise when a Coast Guard helicopter
&quot;rescued&quot;them after homing in on the emergency locator beacon that
activated when the raft was inflated. Not surprisingly, they no longer
work

Subject: Oreos!

As told by a 2nd Lieutenant from an Air Force Base in Texas:

Every second lieutenant acquires embarrassing memories when he wears
gold bars; it seems to come with the job.The first time the Air Force
sent me on temporary duty by myself, I experienced probably the most
embarrassing moment in my life, which I tell here in opes that other
butter bars out there won&apos;t make the same mistake. I was traveling from
Wright-Patterson AFB OH to Vandenberg AFB CA one spring, and the
flight scheduled me for a two-hour layover in the St. Louis MO airport.
I decided to hit the snack bar and bought a cup of coffee, a package of
Oreos and a newspaper. After giving the cashier the nine bucks or so
these items cost, I scanned the crowded sitting area for a place to
relax. The lounge was crowded, but there
appeared to be a spot across from a fellow in a military uniform of
some sort.&quot;Great!&quot;I thought,&quot;another soldier. Maybe he can tell me
about life in the forces.,, With my coffee on the right side of the
table, my newspaper on the left and my oreos in the center, I sat down
before I took my first close look at the man opposite me. He was a
Marine corps brigadier general -a mean-looking man with no hair, an
honest-to-God scar on his forehead and about six rows of ribbons,
including the Silver Star with a cluster. To me, the general had
horns, fangs, a pitchfork and a long, pointed tail as well. I was
already committed to using the table, but not wanting to bother the
general, I meekly squeaked out,&quot;Good morning, sir,&quot;before sitting
down. I had begun the paper&apos;s crossword puzzle and was making good
progress when I heard a peculiar rustling sound, much like the
crinkling of cellophane. I looked up out of the corner of my eye to
discover the general had reached across the center of the table, opened
the package of Oreos, taken out one and was eating it. Now, not having
attended the Air Force Academy, I was not familiar with how to deal with
the finer points of military
etiquette, such as what to do when a senior member of another service
calmly rips off one of your cookies. Several responses came to mind,
but none of these seemed entirely appropriate.
I realized that the honor of the Air Force was, in a small way, at
stake here. I certainly couldn&apos;t let the general think I was a
complete weenie. Besides, at airport prices, one oreo is a significant
fraction
of take home pay for a second lieutenant. The only response I could
make was to reach across the center of the table, open the opposite end
of the package (trying not to notice that the other end had
mysteriously come open somehow), extract an Oreo and eat it very, very
thoroughly.&quot;There,&quot;I thought,&quot;I&apos;ve subtly shown the general that
these are my Oreos, and he should go buy his own.&quot;Marines are known
for many qualities, but subtlety is not among them. The general calmly
reached out for another Oreo and ate it. (By the way, the general was
licking the middles out first before eating the cookies.) Not having
said anything the first time, of course, I couldn&apos;t bring it up now.
The only thing to do was to take
another cookie for myself. We wound up alternating through the entire
package. For an instant our eyes met, and there was palpable tension
in the air, but neither of us said a word. After I had finished the
last Oreo, they announced something over the public address system.
The general got up, put his papers back into his briefcase, picked up
the now empty wrapper, threw it away, brushed the
few crumbs neatly off the table and left. I sat there marveling at his
gall and feeling very foolish. A few minutes later, they announced my
flight. I felt a great deal more foolish when I finished my coffee,
threw the cup away and lifted my newspaper to reveal ... my Oreos!
Today, two of us are running around the Armed Forces telling the same
story, but only one of us has the punch line. And general, if you
are reading this, get in touch with me and I will be glad to send you a
case of Oreos.


Subject: Priorities

A man receives a free ticket to the Super Bowl from his
company. Unfortunately, when he arrives at the stadium
he realizes the seat is in the last row in the corner of the
stadium -- he is closer to the Goodyear Blimp than the field.
About halfway through the first quarter he notices an empty
seat 10 rows off the field right on the 50 yard line. He
decides to take a chance and makes his way through the
stadium and around the security guards to the empty seat.
As he sits down, he asks the gentleman sitting next to him,
&quot;Excuse me, is anyone sitting here?&quot;The man replies,&quot;No.&quot;
Now, very excited to be in such a great seat for the game,
he again inquires of the man next to him,&quot;This is incredible!
Who in their right mind would have a seat like this at the
Super Bowl and not use it?&quot;The man replies,&quot;Well, actually,
the seat belongs to me, I was supposed to come with my
wife, but she passed away. This is the first Super Bowl
we haven&apos;t been together at since we got married in 1942.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&apos;s terribly sad. But still, couldn&apos;t you find someone
to take the seat? A relative or close friend?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot;the man replied,&quot;they&apos;re all at the funeral.&quot;


Subject: Coroner

As he cross-examined the coroner, the defense attorney asked,&quot;Before you
signed the death certificate, had you taken the
man&apos;s pulse?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot;the coroner replied.

&quot;Oh? Did you check for breathing?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;So when you signed the death certificate,&quot;the attorney asked with a
smirk,&quot;you had not taken any steps to make sure the
man was dead, had you?&quot;

&quot;Let me put it this way,&quot;the badgered coroner replied.&quot;The man&apos;s brain
was sitting in a jar on my desk. But,&quot;he added,
&quot;I guess he could still be out there practicing law somewhere.&quot;

bent coathanger to both disks).

Subject: Murphy&apos;s Laws of Computing


1. When computing, whatever happens, behave as though you meant it to
happen.

2. When you get to the point where you really understand your computer,
it&apos;s
probably obsolete.

3. The first place to look for information is in the section of the manual
where you least expect to find it.

 When the going gets tough, upgrade. For every action, there is an equal and opposite malfunction. To err is human... to blame your computer for your mistake is even more 


human.

 He who laughs last probably made a backup. If at first you don&apos;t succeed, blame the computer. A complex system that does not work is invariably found to have 


evolved from
a simpler system that worked just fine.

 The number one cause of computer problems is computer solutions. A computer program will always do what you tell it to do, but rarely 


what
you want it to do.

The News Standard has received this bulletin fresh from our

Subject: A dog&apos;s life...

Every day after lunch, the doctor took a walk through the park. Every
day, sitting on the same park bench, sat a man eating dog food. One day,
the doctor stopped to talk with him...

Doctor: Excuse me sir, I&apos;m a doctor. Are you aware that dog food
isn&apos;t good for you? If you eat it long enough, it could kill you.

Man: I&apos;ve been eating dog food for more than twenty years. It
tastes great, and it&apos;s cheap. Mind your own business!

The next day, the doctor walked took his usual stroll. However, a
stranger was sitting on the bench where the doctor usually saw the man
eating the dog food.

Doctor: Excuse me, sir, but where&apos;s the man who usually sits here
and eats dog food?

Stranger: He&apos;s dead.

Doctor: I knew it! I tried to warn him that eating dog food would
kill him.

Stranger: Oh, it wasn&apos;t the dog food that killed him.

Doctor: What happened?

Stranger: Well, he ate his usual can of dog food, then got up and
left. A little while later, he got hit by a truck while he was sitting in
the street, licking himself!

Subject: You have to follow the script!

So the 2.30pm flight from San Jose to Seattle doesn&apos;t take off until 5pm.
But that&apos;s a different story. The point is it&apos;s now 8pm: I&apos;m tired, I&apos;m
irritable, I&apos;m hungry, I&apos;m lazy. So I decide to avail myself of that
characteristically American service industry: The fast-food restaurant.

For reasons of privacy, I&apos;ve changed the name of the establishment in
question and its star sandwich for the purpose of this narrative. Let&apos;s
call it&quot;Burger Kong&quot;and&quot;The Whimper&quot;.

I arrive at the counter and order a Whimper with cheese combo.

There is an odd pause. A bad sign. Upon further examination, I realize
why: There is no&quot;Whimper with cheese combo&quot;on the menu. There&apos;s a
&quot;Whimper combo&quot;and a&quot;Bacon Whimper with cheese combo&quot;, but no&quot;Whimper
with cheese combo.&quot;

Burger Kong Droid: You mean a Bacon Whimper with cheese combo?

Me: No, just a regular Whimper with cheese combo.

BKD: You mean a Whimper combo?

Me: No, a Whimper with cheese combo.

The BKD is now very confused. So I decide to change my order to get the
ordeal over with.

Me: Nevermind. I&apos;d like a Whimper combo. ... Number 2 on the menu.

The BKD&apos;s demeanor suddenly changes: I&apos;m back on script! Thus relieved,
the BKD then asks the next question on the script, the question that
demonstrates why this story is being retold:

BKD: Would you like cheese on your Whimper?

Subject: It&apos;s a bird! It&apos;s a plane!

This guy goes up to a bar located at the top of the Empire State Building
in New York. It looks like a nice place and he takes a seat at the bar
next to another guy.

&quot;This is a nice place, I&apos;ve never been here&quot;, the first guy says.

&quot;Oh really?&quot;, the other replies,&quot;Well, it&apos;s a very special bar&quot;.

&quot;Why is that?&quot;, the first guy asks.

&quot;Well, you see that painting on the far wall? That&apos;s an original Van Gogh,
and this stool I&apos;m sitting on was on the Titanic.&quot;

&quot;Gee, that&apos;s amazing!&quot;, the first guy says.

&quot;Not only that, but you see that window over there, fourth from the right?
Well, the wind does strange things outside that window. If you jump out
you&apos;ll fall about 50 feet before the wind catches you and
you&apos;re pushed back up.&quot;

&quot;No way! That&apos;s impossible&quot;, the first guy replies.

&quot;Not at all, take a look&quot;, the other man replies and walks over to the
window, followed closely by the first man. He opens the window, climbs
over the sill and falls out. He drops 10...20...30...40...50 feet, comes
to a stop, and whoosh! He comes right back up and sails back through the
window.

&quot;See, it&apos;s fun. You should try it&quot;, he says.

&quot;Try it, I don&apos;t even believe I saw it!&quot;, the first man shouts.

&quot;It&apos;s easy. Watch, I&apos;ll do it again&quot;. And with that, he falls out the
window again. He drops 10...20...30...40...50 feet, comes to a stop, and
whoosh! He comes right back up and sails back through the window.

&quot;Give it a try, it&apos;s a blast&quot;, he says.

&quot;Well, what the heck, I&apos;ll give it a try&quot;, the first man says and jumps
out the window. He falls
10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90..100 feet and splat! He
ends up as road pizza on the sidewalk.

After watching the first man fall to his death, the other guy casually
closes the window and heads back to the bar and orders another drink.

The bartender arrives with the drink and says,&quot;You know Superman, you&apos;re
a real jerk when you&apos;re drunk&quot;.


Subject: Yet another Genie joke!

A man walking along the beach found a bottle. When he rubbed it, lo and
behold, a genie appeared.

&quot;I will grant you three wishes,&quot;announced the genie.&quot;But there is one
condition. I am a Lawyer&apos;s
Genie. That means that for every wish you make, every lawyer in the world
gets the wish as
well--only double.&quot;

The man thought about this for a while.&quot;For my first wish, I would like
ten million dollars,&quot;he announced.

Instantly the genie gave him a Swiss bank account number and assured the
man
that $10,000,000 had been deposited.&quot;But every lawyer in the world has
just
recieved $20,000,000,&quot;the genie said.

&quot;I&apos;ve always wanted a Ferrari,&quot;the man said.&quot;That&apos;s my second wish.&quot;

Instantly a Ferrari appeared.&quot;But every lawyer in the world has just
