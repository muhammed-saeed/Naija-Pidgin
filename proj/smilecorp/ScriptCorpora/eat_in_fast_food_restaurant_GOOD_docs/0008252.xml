 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS MARKET ANALYSIS COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS DESIGN&amp;DEVELOPMENT PLANS OPERATIONS&amp;MANAGEMENT PLANS FINANCIAL COMPONENTS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The market demand has never been greater for food that is healthy,
 economically priced, and great tasting. This is the last market with wide
 open potential for growth. Traditionally, pasta has been consumed in fine
 restaurants, usually in a more formal or sit-down atmosphere at high
 prices. As pasta has moved to the center stage as a product that both
 tastes good and is good for you, Pasta Now! has positioned itself to
 provide the services in demand by the American consumer: a variety of
 healthy pastas, moderately priced and with very good taste. The basic
 focus is to provide the consumer with a healthy, quality meal which is
 economically priced. This is a concept that will never grow old.

Pasta Now! is a franchise system with ongoing support from the national
 franchisor. National assistance includes site selection, restaurant
 design, comprehensive training, and support of ongoing operations through
 marketing assistance, quality control programs, research and development.

Pasta Now! of Las Vegas will require a total financial commitment of
 $100,000. The franchise fee for the Las Vegas store will be $10,000, with
 an additional $12,500 to purchase the rights for all of Nevada. The
 remaining money will be used in opening the first Nevada store in Las
 Vegas. The Miller&apos;s equity contribution will be $15,000 in cash.
 Additionally, the Millers have $60,000 of equity in their residence.

Pasta Now! of Las Vegas will have the right to sell stores throughout
 Nevada. As these additional franchises are sold, Pasta Now! will retain
 $7,500 of each franchise fee paid. Monthly royalties from each of these
 Nevada stores will be 3% of gross.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

History

Pasta Now! of Las Vegas is being structured to operate franchises of the
 national chain Pasta Now! Additionally, we will sell a limited number of
 franchises of the national chain. Pasta Now! is headquartered in the
 Cleveland, OH area. Pasta Now! of Las Vegas has the exclusive right to
 operate and sell franchises in Nevada.

The national Pasta Now! chain was established in 1987 with the opening of
 the original Pasta Now! The company has been franchising since 1991.
 Recent growth has been in the Cleveland metro area, where there are
 currently eight stores in operation. Pasta Now! has recently signed a
 master franchise agreement to open ten additional stores in the state of
 Michigan in the next five years.

Ownership Structure

Ownership of the business is in the form of a Nevada corporation with 51%
 of the stock owned by Roland Miller and the remaining 49% owned by Sheila
 Miller. This Nevada corporation will in turn own Pasta Now! of Las Vegas.

Sheila Miller has prior business experience in the ownership of a mobile
 Ice Cream/Catering business. Mrs. Miller has also acquired human resource
 experience while employed as a Human Resources Assistant for St.
 Mary&apos;s Hospital.

Roland Miller has gained management and budget experience through his work
 as a Captain with the Las Vegas Fire Department.

Both Mr.&amp;Mrs. Miller have been educated in the Total Quality
 Management concept used by many of today&apos;s successful major
 corporations.

Pasta Now! is a fast food pasta chain that focuses on the drawing power of
 an Italian restaurant that meets the needs of people on the go who still
 want a healthy product at reasonable prices.

For many years, the only place you could get a variety of quality pasta
 was at sit-down Italian restaurants that were expensive and did not meet
 the needs of the customer in a hurry.

Products/Services

The Pasta Now! menu is centered around a variety of pasta dishes with a
 variety of sauces. The majority of sauces are cooked on site. For
 diversity, Pasta Now! also offers individual pizzas, a line of Italian
 sandwiches and a selection of salads. Pasta Now! menu items are available
 for eat-in or take-out. Pasta Now! also features a complete party menu.
 Catering for any size occasion is available.

The service will be exceptional. The#l goal of each employee will be
 customer satisfaction. Pasta Now! believes in the old fashioned motto,&quot;the customer is always right.&quot;In today&apos;s society,
 where customer service is often lacking (or nonexistent), we will
 structure our business to provide the best service possible in a friendly,
 helpful atmosphere.

Geographical Area

Pasta Now! will draw customers primarily from Las Vegas, with some
 penetration in to neighboring counties.

Pasta Now! will draw on the Las Vegas community&apos;s growing
 reputation as a regional shopping hub. Pasta Now! franchises are
 structured to operate in areas with populations between 25,000 and 30,000
 people.

There are no physical limitations to the market area since the Las Vegas
 location is well served by several state highways. There are many
 competing, well-established fast food outlets in the area; however, none
 of them are currently providing a similar product.

Major Customers

Pasta Now! relies on customer volume with no identifiable major customers.
 However, the customers can be categorized as:

 baby boomers and their children state employees adults age 50 and above tourists 

Facilities/Equipment

Pasta Now! is structured to operate in strip mall-type locations. The
 corporate headquarters provides detailed site selection assistance,
 including lease negotiations.

Pasta Now! is designed to function in a 1500 to 2000 square-foot store. A
 drive-up window can be utilized if a suitable site for such is located.

Prospective sites which have been preliminarily identified include; the
 Bryson&apos;s shopping center in south Las Vegas, the Forest center in
 Northern Las Vegas or the Daly shopping center on Highway 12.

The equipment necessary for the operation of Pasta Now! will be purchased
 from any of the several restaurant supply companies located in the area.

Organization

Pasta Now&apos;s staff will be divided into two functional areas,
 Operations and Administration. Each division will he headed by one of the
 principals.

MARKET ANALYSIS

Geography/Demographics

The national trend toward eating out has increased over the last 5 years.
 In 1993, the amount of money spent on eating out was equal to what was
 spent for consumption inside the home. This is the first time that
 consumers spent as much for&quot;eat out&quot;food as they did for&quot;at home&quot;food. According to American Demographics magazine,
 by the year 1996, spending on restaurants and take-out food will overtake
 the nation&apos;s grocery bill. The market demand has never been greater
 for food that is healthy, economically priced, and great tasting. The
 recent health-oriented menu options added to national chains like Taco Hut
 and even Smith&apos;s, point to the nation&apos;s desire for healthy
 food. In an analysis of casual dining, Restaurant Business Magazine noted
 that baby boomers, and others, are coming face-to-face with the
 realization that youth is ephemeral. With that realization has come more
 emphasis on healthy dining alternatives like pasta.

Customers

The customers for restaurants in the geographical area served by Pasta
 Now! can be categorized as follows:

 Baby boomers and their children State employees Adults age 50 and above Tourists 

There are several identifiable characteristics of the market area that
 determine the segmentation as listed. Since this area is rapidly growing,
 as opposed to mature, there are new home buyers who tend to have families
 and dine out often. According to American Demographics Magazine, baby
 boomers and their families eat out an average four times per week.

Since Las Vegas is such a busy area, there are a large number of tourists
 and state employees who are looking for a place to take lunch. During a
 recent, non-scientific, interview session, state employees from the
 Department of Transportation and the Department of Motor Vehicles were
 asked at random how many times per week they dine out for lunch. The
 average number of times the respondents dined out for lunch was 2.7 days
 per week.

Adults over 50 dine out an average of 2.4 times per week. Recent trends
 indicate that adults age 50+ are dining out less often, but they are more
 attracted to restaurants that offer food to be eaten at home. Pasta Now!
 can satisfy their needs.

Assumptions

The strategic goals and plans for Pasta Now! are based on the following
 assumptions:

The national and local trends toward consumption of healthy food will
 continue. All indications from national publications consulted agree that
 healthy food which is reasonably priced will continue its popularity well
 into the next century.

The trend toward dining out will remain steady. Indications are that
 dining out will actually increase over the next five to seven years.

Supply&amp;Demand

The restaurant industry in the U.S. has been characterized by rapid
 change. During the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s, dining out was a new
 experience for a country feeling the effects of post-war affluence. Also,
 the various wars have increased the awareness of many Americans with foods
 from different cultures. This has spawned a trend toward restaurants
 featuring food from Europe and Asia.

An American original, the diner, spread across the country and soon
 evolved into chain restaurants operated by local and regional
 corporations. During this period, a new restaurant concept grew up from
 the corner hamburger stand. The fast food restaurant was started from such
 humble beginnings and quickly multiplied.

Over the next two decades fast food matured and changed at the same time
 to meet the changing tastes of the public.

While fast food chains experienced significant growth, restaurants evolved
 also. During the late 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s,&quot;natural&quot;food restaurants became popular, only to give way to nouvelle cuisine in
 the 80&apos;s. The trend in the 90&apos;s is to healthy food low in
 fat, cholesterol and sugar.

The national restaurant industry includes approximately 125,000
 restaurants plus 235,000 fast food restaurants, according to the National
 Restaurant Owners Association (NROA). NROA estimates that combined
 restaurant sales reached 4.5 billion dollars last year.

The local market reflects the national trends. As pasta has moved to the
 center stage as a product that both tastes good and is good for you, Pasta
 Now! has positioned itself to provide the services in demand by the
 American consumer: a variety of healthy pastas, moderate price, and very
 good taste.

Growth Factors

The number of restaurants will grow at an annual rate of 7.3% for the next
 five years according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of
 Agriculture.

The growth can be attributed to many factors, such as a continued trend
 toward two income families, thus eating out more for lunches and having
 little time to prepare a meal after work. The biggest potential for growth
 involves food prepared for consumption, or take-out food. As the name
 Pasta Now! implies, we are positioned to take advantage of either market
 segment.

The local area will experience a growth rate above the national average
 due to the rapid growth of the population throughout Nevada.

Product Lifecycle

The restaurant industry is in a rapidly growing phase. Although this
 growth trend means opportunities for increased sales volume and higher
 profit margins, overhead must be closely monitored. The importance of
 quality control, purchasing, low overhead, advertising and marketing
 cannot be overstated.

At all of the Pasta Now! franchise locations, customer loyalty has been
 developed through its excellent service and popular menu. Attention must
 be paid to trends, however, and changes should be made early in both the
 menu and the decor before customers become bored and move on to a newer
 experience.

Price Structure

Pasta Now! is structured to present good food and reasonable prices. As
 such, Pasta Now! operates with food costs at 34% of gross. This figure is
 somewhat higher than industry standards for the same type of menu;
 however, Pasta Now! strives to maintain affordable prices. Pasta Now! will
 keep menu prices at reasonable levels to attract the largest share
 possible from its demographic base.

Marketing Process

Pasta Now! will market the food and service of its restaurant using a
 custom designed campaign by the Jules Advertising agency in Cleveland.

Advertising campaigns will utilize newspaper, radio, and direct mail
 coupon marketing. Pasta Now! also markets its catering services through
 fax advertising to local businesses.

The ad agency has developed several creative direct mail promotions for
 use throughout the Pasta Now! system.

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

Pasta Now! will have no direct competition in the Las Vegas market. City
 records show that there are a total of 89 businesses listed in the broad
 category of restaurants. Of these, 12 feature some form of pasta as a menu
 item. Additionally 4 Italian restaurants are listed, each with several
 pasta items. None of the local restaurants specializes in quality pasta at
 affordable prices in a fast food setting.

Disadvantages

Name recognition

As a fast food outlet, Pasta Now! does not have the name recognition of
 other national chains.

New food concept

Italian food in general, and more specifically pasta, are new concepts in
 fast food.

Rental costs

Prime rental locations are extremely costly.

Advantages

Healthy food

The current fast food market does not provide for fast healthy food. Pasta
 Now! fills that void by allowing customers to obtain fast food which is
 healthy for them and their children.

Price

Pasta Now! offers Italian food at lower prices than typical sit-down
 Italian restaurants.

Service

Pasta Now! will operate with the motto&quot;the customer is always
 right.&quot;In today&apos;s busy world, the customer service aspect
 of the restaurant business is often overlooked.

Untapped market

Pasta Now! will offer an alternative not currently available in the Las
 Vegas area.

DESIGN&amp;DEVELOPMENT PLANS

Goals

Goal 1

Opening of first Pasta Now! in Las Vegas by October 1 of 1995.

Goal 2

Achieve $250,000 - $300,000 in gross sales in the first year of operation.

Goal 3

Sell 5 additional franchises within the first 7 years of operation.

Risk Analysis

The following risks are inherent in the pursuit of the stated goals:

 The lack of name recognition in our area will impede sales potential. Attracting potential franchise owners will be difficult. Opening of our first store will be dependent on receiving financial
 assistance through loans. 

Evaluation Methods

Pasta Now! will evaluate the achievement of its stated goals by measuring
 financial factors.

Pasta Now! will monitor monthly sales volume as compared to monthly
 operating costs. Monthly increases will be expected in the gross sales
 category.

Sales of additional franchises will be measured by the actual opening of
 new stores in Nevada.
 Contacts with potential franchisees will be measured in terms of the
 number of inquiries obtained on a monthly basis.

Strategic Actions

Strategy 1

The goal is to open the first Pasta Now! in Las Vegas by October 1, 1995.
 The area is growing rapidly and presents many opportunities to take
 advantage of the shopping market.

Strategy 1 calls for finding financing to the level necessary to satisfy
 our needs. The estimated level necessary to accomplish this goal is
 $65,000 to $ 100,000.

Additionally, a location will need to be secured. Location assistance is
 provided by the corporate headquarters. Location considerations include
 traffic patterns and counts, immediate area demographics, and location of
 a suitable strip mall facility.

Strategy 2

The goal is to achieve $250,000 - $300,000 in gross sales in the first
 year of operation. This will be accomplished through a marketing plan
 which is constructed by the corporate office. The franchisor requires that
 4% of the monthly gross be spent on advertising. 2% of this goes directly
 to a local marketing campaign. The remaining 2% goes to the corporate
 headquarters to be used to develop radio and print material for our local
 franchise stores. The plan includes advertising, direct mail marketing and
 promotional activities. In addition, corporate headquarters structures
 food preparation and management styles to maximize profit while keeping
 the overhead to a minimum.

Strategy 3

The goal is to sell 5 additional franchises within a five-year period.
 This will be accomplished through an extensive training program provided
 to Mr.&amp;Mrs. Miller by the president of the corporation. In
 addition to the sales assistance provided by the corporate headquarters, a
 franchise consultant has been retained.
