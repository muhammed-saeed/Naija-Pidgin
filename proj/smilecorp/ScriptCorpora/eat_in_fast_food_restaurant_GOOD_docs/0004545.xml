More Thrifty Finds
 I love going to yard sales because most people are really trying to simplify, and so they offer pretty good deals. My favorite things to look for are usually kitchen items because I cringe when I see the prices for dishes and pots and pans in department stores. I do enjoy looking through any books available as well, for a chance to pick up a favorite or classic, although we utilize our public library a lot, and I do have a kindle for some digital books. I usually glance to see if there are any kids clothing my children are in need of. Of course my kids, at least the two younger, head right for the toys, and I must admit, I cave too often. With the season changing quickly to cool here, I have to settle for other thrifty options besides yard sales, for instance our (sort of local) Salvation Army store is pretty well stocked. Here are some of my recent thrifty purchases that I am excited about.

 I liked this vibrant colored leaf dish, and only paid around a dollar for it. It&apos;s the perfect size to hold a set of keys, or rings by the sink...

 For six dollars I picked up this handy bread box, which I intend to give a makeover. At the moment it holds vitamins and prescriptions instead of bread, go figure.

 My sister started me on a soup bowl collection with a giant chocolate brown handled bowl (which my husband thinks is a great coffee mug), and now I am on the lookout for cute soup bowls/mugs. I picked these up at a thrift store in W.Va that my family likes to visit when we&apos;re there, and I think they look a bit vintage.

 At the same thrift store I was fortunate to find this book by Mary Hunt, who by the way is an excellent resource for money saving tips. She has several very readable, helpful and down to earth books.
Even though I use our public library often, it is nice to own some really good books for quick reference. An advantage to getting things like this for very little money is that when you&apos;re done using them, it&apos;s much easier to let go and pass them on without regrets!

Happy bargain hunting!

The red leaf would have been coming home with me too.
For some reason this year I am attracted to acorns, and fall leaves. (decorative objects)

I have those same exact soup mugs! I have a set of four that were given by a fast food restaurant about 30 years ago filled with clam chowder. I remember buying them even though I hate clam chowder just because I loved the bowls! We use them all the time...they don&apos;t have so much as a chip on them after all these years. Enjoy them!!!

Great finds! I enjoy going to thrift stores but don&apos;t get the chance very often anymore.

OMG, we had those exact soup bowls back in the 70s! Thanks for the smile.

How I Grocery Shop
 About 16 months ago, I started using coupons when I grocery shop. I have literally saved thousands of dollars. I don&apos;t &quot;extreme&quot; coupon shop, as I rarely buy more than 3 or 4 of an item at a time, but just by combining sales with coupons I have been able to fill my pantry with the best deals just by buying multiples of items at their cheapest. I have a small chest freezer for perishables, and I spend more than most coupon extremists you might see, because I still buy favorite items and lots of produce and lean meats. Moderation is my key word for couponing (and lots of things). Two hours or so a week and two Sunday papers gives me the savings I enjoy.
