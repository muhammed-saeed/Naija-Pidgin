 Eleanor Zitek and Pat Savage Pat and I made our first visit to the Szechwan Chinese Restaurant one Tuesday evening in September. As you might expect, the decor is Chinese. It’s bright and cheerful, made elegant with white tablecloths. As is required by law in all Chinese restaurants, we shared everything we ordered. We started our dinner with appetizers of Candy Crispy Shrimp and Lettuce Wrap Chicken. Both appetizers were delicious. The Candy Crispy Shrimp was just what the name suggests: shrimp fried crispy in a delicious sweet sauce. The Lettuce Wrap Chicken contains minced chicken stir-fried in plum sauce. The chicken, topped with pine nuts, was served on a large lettuce leaf, and is eaten with the fingers after making a taco-like wrap of the meat in the lettuce. The chicken is bland but tasty, slightly sweet, and served hot, and the mix of hot chicken and ice-cold lettuce is interesting on the tongue.
Neither Pat nor I like super spicy food, so we ignored the foods marked “Hot and Spicy,? which eliminated much of the menu from consideration. I ordered Happy Family, which contains shrimp, beef, chicken, and vegetables in a special House sauce. Pat chose Rainbow Beef, which is beef tenderloin stir-fried with shoestring-cut vegetables. The beef in both dishes was a bit tough, and neither dish was even a little bit spicy. In fact, they were a bit too bland for us, and we decided that on our next visit we would bravely order from the “Hot and Spicy? selections.
To accompany our food, Pat and I ordered a bottle of Currency Creek Estate Ostrich Hill Shiraz that we hadn’ t tasted before. It was a very good wine, even warm. The wines are stored on top of a 3/4 wall that separates the dining room from a service area, and our bottle came from up there. The wine went well with the appetizers, but totally overpowered the entrees.
Last week we visited again. For this second visit, we decided to have Tsingtao beer, figuring correctly that Chinese beer would go well with Chinese food. Again we started with Candy Crispy Shrimp, it’s just too good to skip. To that we added the hot and spicy Seafood Rolls, which came with a heavenly (and quite spicy) chili sauce. Delicious! For our main course, Pat ordered the Willow Beef and I had the Empress Chicken. The menu says that they “adjust spiciness according to your tastes,? so we asked for “medium hot.? As on our first visit, the beef was tough, but the dish was well-flavored and the sauce was good. The Empress Chicken was tender, the breading was crisp, and the sauce was sweet and spicy at the same time. “Medium hot? turned out to be a little too hot for Pat, just about right for me. Of course, he found a little teeny spice bomb in the Willow Beef that brought tears to his eyes. He’ll be choosing “mild? from now on. 
After two visits that included seven different dishes, we have decided that the service is excellent, the sauces are very good, and the Empress Chicken is wonderful, but the beef could use a little more tenderizing and for our tastes the wine should be chilled. We’ll eat there again, but we’ll probably not order anything with beef and we’ll drink beer instead of wine.  Ellen Roper We went to Szechwan on a Tuesday for lunch. We were promptly greeted and shown to our table. The restaurant has such a calming atmosphere, it is a nice escape from the work day. 
Lunch is such a deal here it is hard to know what to order. First off, always, is an order of the Szechwan dumplings. They are served to perfection in a wonderful garlicky, spicy sauce. 
We chose to order from the Super Luncheon Combo, which includes your choice of soup (Hot&amp;Sour or Egg Drop), a vegetarian spring roll, Crab Rangoon, rice and a fortune cookie. I selected the Kung Bao Shrimp ($7.95) and Mike had the Empress Chicken ($6.25). First, I must say, the Crab Rangoon was excellent. The shrimp was so fresh and prepared perfectly; you could just taste the freshness. It had a slightly spicy sauce that included onions, peppers and mushrooms. The Empress chicken was also a spicy dish, with a hint of sweetness. The chicken is lightly battered and fried. Mike really enjoyed that dish. This is the first time he has tried anything other than the Mountain Snow Shrimp, which is truly a taste experience not to be missed.
One thing about Szechwan’s is that when a dish is brought out you know it is going to be wonderful. The ingredients combine to make a very special presentation. There are no little bottles of soy sauce or other condiments on the tables, not even salt and pepper. And as many times as I have been to Szechwan’s, I have never had to ask for any of those items. The service is excellent, attention is paid to every detail, whether you need more drinks or plates need removing. 
We will definitely return, it is always a treat to stop in for lunch or dinner.  Patricia Sides I became addicted to Jimmy Jeng’s award-winning Szechwan cuisine during my first visit there, shortly after it opened seven years ago. In a city so fortunate to have as many fine and diverse restaurants as it does, the Szechwan Restaurant is my absolute favorite. Regardless of how busy it is, from the moment you walk through the door, you’re treated amiably by all the staff, especially owner Jimmy Jeng and his wife Tina. 
On a recent visit, I decided to order my favorite entree, Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, although my companion and I enjoy sampling from the extensive menu. The dish consists of plump, tender shrimp sautéed with eggs, peas, mushrooms, and ground pork in a savory lobster sauce. My companion ordered the Rainbow Beef, succulent chunks of beef stir-fried with vegetables in a non-spicy but flavorsome sauce. 
Before the entrees were delivered, my companion and I lingered over another favorite, the Szechwan Dumplings, which are packed with flavored ground pork and vegetables and steeped in a sauce that is too scrumptious to describe. Another favorite is the Dan-Dan Mein, noodles combined with a spicy peanut butter paste and vegetables – simple but mouth-watering fare. For vegetarians, the menu lists a pleasing assortment of meatless dishes, such as Ma-Pow Tofu, freshly-prepared with chili paste and black bean sauce. All dishes are served at the perfect eating temperatures, and despite the crowds that this restaurant often attracts, the waiting time for food is minimal.
Creating a memorable dining experience for customers is a top priority here, and the staff’s consistently superb service reflects this aim. This is one of the few Chinese restaurants in Evansville that doesn’t offer a buffet (which is one reason we eat here), probably because Jimmy Jeng and his staff wouldn’t be able to devote as much personal attention to each table of diners. Even when the room is humming with activity, the ambience is always warm, relaxing, and elegant. Lou Ann Green We arrived at Jimmy Jeng’s Szechwan Chinese Restaurant for lunch on a recent Thursday. 
It was refreshing to be shown to a table and handed a menu, and not have to navigate the ever-present buffet lines prevalent at so many Oriental establishments.
We started off our meal with a couple of standard appetizers, an order of Crabby Cheese Rangoon ($4.95) and an order of Vegetarian Spring Rolls (two for $2.50). 
The Crab Rangoon was fresh, with crispy fried outer wrappers, and a creamy, cheesy filling which melted on the tongue. 
The Spring Rolls were also crisp on the outside, with crunchy bits of mixed vegetables in the center. They were served with a slightly plum-flavored Sweet&amp;Sour Sauce, which was a bit on the thin side, but very light, avoiding the overly sweet, cloying taste found at many Chinese restaurants.
We took advantage of the Daily Luncheon Specials, which include a variety of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp dishes served with either Hot Sour or Egg Drop Soup, Fried Rice and a Fortune Cookie. Dan chose the Shrimp with Garlic Sauce ($6.25) and Lou Ann opted for the Sweet&amp;Sour Chicken ($5.25).
Although the slight reddish color of the Egg Drop Soup was a bit disconcerting at first, we discovered it to have an excellent flavor. Mild, not overly salty, and served up hot, it was an excellent start to the meal. 
Dan’s Shrimp with Garlic Sauce included an extremely generous portion of good-sized shrimp, combined with broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts in a rich, brown garlic sauce. The portion of fried rice that came with the meal was flavorful, with bits of egg, veggies and meat mixed in with the rice. 
Lou Ann’s Sweet&amp;Sour Chicken included a generous portion of deep-fried white meat chicken pieces along with slices of pineapple and green pepper, all accompanied with a light, slighty sweet/slighty sour sauce which was the perfect addition to the dish. The portion of fried rice that was included with the meal made this a satisfying mid-ay repast. 
The service was attentive without being overly obtrusive, and we had sufficient time to enjoy our meal while still finishing in plenty of time to return to work.
Jimmy Jeng’s is a wonderful find, and we will be going back, if only to try more of the dishes offered.  Gary and Susan Thomas Susan and I had dinner on Sunday with our good friends Tom and Linda. 
We like Jimmy Jeng’s for many reasons. The staff is efficient and attentive. The menu offers many of the traditional dishes. Susan chose the beef dinner, which included a main course as well as the usual sides. There are ample selections to test your sense of adventure.
I chose the Seafood Double Fried Noodle. I had no idea what it was going be like but I loved every bite. The food is good, the price is reasonable, there is always plenty to take home and Jimmy will make you smile.  Stacy Heuer Unfortunately the food did not live up to the very pleasant decor. We tried the Szechwan Beef (served with steamed rice, soup, vegetarian spring roll, and crab Rangoon) and the Szechwan String Bean (served with fried rice, and soup) on a recent lunch visit.
The flavors in both entrees were very good, but that was overpowered by the greasiness of the dishes, especially the string beans. The plum sauce served with the spring roll was one of the best in town; unfortunately the spring Roll itself was bland and extremely greasy. To make matters worse, when the waiter boxed up our leftovers he put everything in one carton, losing the distinct flavors of the two dishes.
With several other Chinese restaurants to choose from, I will not be returning.  Ronald and Earlene Miller Neither Earlene nor I are really big fans of Chinese cuisine. Most of our experience with Chinese food has been of the buffet variety. We usually find several items that we like and the price is reasonable at the area buffets.
We made our initial visit to (Jimmy Jeng’s) for our evening meal recently. We were immediately greeted and seated by the owner. We were impressed with his friendliness and the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant.
Earlene settled for the Super Dinner with chicken. It consisted of soup, egg roll, crab rangoon, and white meat chicken with cashews. There were also miniature ears of corn and other veggies. A lot of food for $9.95! The hot and sour soup was very good with just about the right balance of flavors. As a matter of fact, Earlene pronounced every one of the items in her dinner to be excellent. She even had some left to take home.
I chose Pan Fried Salmon Steak ($14.95). It was accompanied by steamed rice and a small salad mix, which was on the plate with the fish. The salmon was in a very tasty sauce that was somewhat sweet but had a bit of a bite to it. The sauce had the effect of clearing my sinuses! The owner told me that I could request my preferred degree of spiciness next time.
We were impressed with the quality of the food, and the service was impeccable. Also, they don’t use MSG in their food. 
Szechwan is definitely worth a visit if you enjoy Chinese cuisine. This might just be the place that will convert us from buffet to menu. Who knows, we may even learn to use chopsticks!  Butch and Donna Gish We started with a favorite of ours — crab rangoon ($6.95 for six). It was piping hot. but the cheese filling was quite runny — not our favorite texture for crab rangoon.
We shared chicken fried rice ($4.95) and Happy Family ($13.95). Happy Family is a combination of shrimp, chicken and beef with vegetables in a brown sauce. We both thought both dishes were good, but not great. The chicken fried rice was not very hot (temperature wise).
The service was fast and efficient — maybe a little too fast because I felt like they were rushing us out even though the place was not that busy for a Friday evening.
We probably won’t go back because there are several other places we like better when we are hungry for
Chinese food (Janbo’s, China Bistro, Two Brothers). 

Today was a busy day, with no time to eat until late afternoon, so Pat and I decided to have brunner (BReakfast, lUNch, and dinNER) at El Charro Mexican Restaurant. This was our first visit to El Charro.
From our home in Newburgh, it’s 13.3 miles — plus two trips around the block because we had a little trouble finding the place.

The restaurant is located at the north end of a strip mall on North Sonntag Avenue; it’s anchored on the south end by a CVS Pharmacy and a Wesselman’s Supermarket. However, the street sign for El Charro is a long block away on Mt. Vernon Avenue.

The decor is typical for a Mexican restaurant. There’s a serape advertising Corona on the wall, and a sculpted metal mariachi band hangs out in an alcove. Booths along the walls have been dressed in green and white striped vinyl, and there are several tables in the center of the room.

Our server brought chips and salsa immediately, and we ordered guacamole dip to ensure that we had some fruit with our meal. The chips were fresh, thin and crisp, but had no particular flavor, and the salsa was mild. The guacamole was fresh and contained large chunks of tomato and bits of green pepper. Pat and I both liked it a lot, so we didn’t waste any.

For our main course, Pat ordered the Dinner Grande, which includes a chile relleno (a breaded chili pepper stuffed with finely ground beef), a chalupa (a muffin wrapper-shaped crisp corn tortilla filled with beans, lettuce, tomato and guacamole), a beef taco, beef tamale and beef enchilada, accompanied by rice and beans.

His favorite of the five was the chile relleno, which he said was the best he’s ever had, with just the right amount of spiciness, and the finely ground beef was less greasy than regular ground beef.

Pat ranked the chalupa (his first-ever chalupa) as his second favorite, followed in order of preference by the taco (he loved the flaky, crispy flour tortilla that replaced the usual corn tortilla), the enchilada and the tamale. He said the rice and beans were the perfect complement to the meal.

Another of the menu offerings is simply called Combination: Choose up to three of your favorite items among six choices (taco, enchilada, burrito, chile relleno, tamale, chimichanga) filled with your choice of ground beef, shredded chicken or cheese.

I ordered a Combination of cheese enchilada, beef taco and beef tamale. The Combination comes with rice and beans on the side.

My favorite of the three was the cheese enchilada. It was perfectly cooked, and the cheese innards tasted exactly right with the spiced-just-right red sauce that covered the enchilada and tamale.

The taco was tasty, and I agree with Pat about the flour tortilla shell on the taco — it was unusual, and didn’t overpower the fillings the way corn tortillas do. My tamale, like Pat’s, was tough — both the meat and the masa (cornmeal) coating were overcooked, and the ends of the tamale were hard and dry. I also agree with Pat about the rice: It was properly cooked and properly seasoned to counteract the spiciness of the meal.

Believe it or not, even after such a meal, we had dessert. Pat is addicted to both cheesecake and strawberries, and it’s amazing how often he can get the latter on top of the former.

The cheesecake slice was small, warm on the outside edges and ice cold in the middle (perhaps frozen, then nuked before serving?), but it tasted just fine. I had a couple of small bites, after which Pat suggested I should eat my own dessert. I wasn’t hungry after my meal, but in the interest of comprehensive reporting, I ordered sopapilla, which at El Charro is a deep-fried flour tortilla topped with lots of honey butter, a few drops of chocolate sauce and a few drops of strawberry sauce. It was thin, crunchy, very sweet and too much for me to eat; I managed a few bites, but had to give up quickly.

Pat and I don’t know if El Charro really is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. We’re new here — we have to try them all before we can decide. But we’ll definitely go back there. There’s a whole lot of food on the menu that we still have to sample and we suspect it will be as tasty as our first meal.

 Gary and Susan Thomas Once we found El Charro, on the West Side, we were pleasantly surprised with the restaurant. The host and waiters were very friendly, even cracking a few jokes that put everyone in a good mood. The menu was extensive and everything looked appetizing.
We started with an appetizer of Nachos Fiesta, which we all four shared. It was brought out quickly and attacked by our hungry group. Susan ordered the Fajitas Charro. It was an enormous, piping-hot skillet with a combination of chicken, beef and pork with red and green peppers and onions in a spicy seasoning. It was delicious and enough to take home for at least two more meals.
Gary’s Seafood Fiesta was a combination of white fish, shrimp, steamed vegetables and rice. The dish was an ample portion and moderately spicy. The food and personable attention of the staff made this a place we would seek out again.  John and Lisa Robinson We liked the brightly decorated restaurant and the friendly staff. The tortilla chips and salsa were fresh and tasty.
John ordered the Nachos Fajitas, a hearty combination of grilled beef, onion, green pepper and tomatoes served over tortilla chips.
Lisa had the Flautas Mexicanas, which were fried corn tortillas filled with grilled chicken and vegetables. Our food was very flavorful and the servings were large — a great value for the price. The only issue was that the menu did not clearly indicate that the Nachos Fajitas were prepared with tomatoes.
It was a pleasant surprise that the menu choices were different from what we have seen at other Mexican restaurants in the area. We enjoyed our visit and will go back.  Evelyn Cave I went to El Charro about 1:15 p.m., expecting most of the lunch crowd to be gone. However, the restaurant was still quite full and more people were seated even after I finished my lunch. Because of some comments I heard, it seemed like there were a lot of return customers.
I was seated and was served chips and salsa right away. The chips were warm and quite thin and crispy. Very good. The salsa was not that great, though; it was a bit too thin and seemed like it was made with canned tomatoes with very little flavor.
I ordered the chimichanga with shredded beef. It was excellent, with onions and tomatoes and a very good flavor. The rice was a bit dry, but I added the salsa and it was then very tasty.
The service was excellent.
The lunch menu has many items to choose from and all are $5.95. The serving size was as large as I would expect for dinner. All in all, it was a good experience and I would go back again.  Makaila and Wayne Blackburn My husband and I arrived at El Charro at 5:55 p.m. for dinner. We were greeted immediately and were seated in a booth; chips and salsa were being delivered even before we could get settled. A server came and took our drink order and I also ordered some cheese dip. All items were brought to us immediately. We asked for a few minutes to look at the menu.
My husband ordered a steak and french fries. I ordered a Combination with taco, cheese enchilada and beef enchilada with beans and rice. I wanted to taste a variety of food on this visit. Our order was at our table, hot and steaming, very quickly. Our drinks and chips were refilled quickly when they started to get low. The steak and fries were hot and steaming. The cheese was melted on the enchiladas and the beans, and was melting on the taco. The taco shell was homemade. It was a great meal.
While we were there the restaurant started to fill up with families. The atmosphere was festive and looked like a Mexican village. It was authentic. The servers would bring the dishes out all laid out on their arms. They could carry six hot plates on their outstretched arms. It was something to see.
For dessert, I ordered the flan. My husband ordered the sopapilla. Both were presented quickly and in a very nice manner. The food looked excellent and it tasted wonderful.
The service in the restaurant was exceptional. The food was all served as ordered in a quick manner. The taste of all the items sampled on this visit was excellent. Everything, from the lettuce to the chips to the main course and the dessert, was fresh and presented in an appetizing manner. It was an excellent visit. I would definitely return for a repeat performance.  David and Penne Gambrall I am not usually a big fan of Mexican food. So, when David and I traveled to the West Side recently, I wasn’t overly excited. My mind was quickly changed! Upon entering El Charro we were immediately greeted and seated.
The menu is vast with many of the traditional Mexican favorites available. As we studied the menu we were served a basket of warm chips and salsa that was very enjoyable. David said he thought it was the best salsa to be found in a local Mexican restaurant.
I chose the chimichanga with ground beef. The portion was huge. My entree was accompanied by rice, beans and guacamole. There was a light queso on my chimichanga. David ordered the taco, enchilada and burrito combo with ground beef. Rice and beans were served with his entree as well.
Our meals were served promptly and were very tasty. Our server was extremely attentive and the overall service was exemplary. Our impression of El Charro was very favorable. Cozy atmosphere, great service, delicious food and interesting decor to boot. We will definitely make El Charro a mainstay on our dining list.  Linda and Tom Mioduszewski We visited El Charro on a Sunday evening. The interior is painted in festive colors. All the wait staff were pleasant and friendly. Portion sizes were generous. The chicken entree and the combination beef, shrimp and chicken entree were both above average. El Charro is a cheerful place to share a meal with friends.  Ron and Earlene Miller Earlene and I were joined by Bill&amp;Darla Sims on our visit to El Charro. While we waited for our friends to arrive we enjoyed the chips and salsa. The chips arrived warm and the accompanying salsa, while thin, did contain chunks of tomato and was not too hot.
Bill and I both chose the Fiesta Burrito with ground beef. Refried beans and rice came with our meals. Earlene and Darla both chose the Combination with identical items; soft shell taco, chile relleno, and a burrito, all with ground beef filling; it also includes refried beans and rice.
We all felt the ground beef filling was not seasoned as much as that offered in some other area Mexican restaurants. Neither Earlene nor Darla cared much for the Chile Relleno, saying that it didn’t have much flavor. The refried beans were pretty typical; I would have preferred a little more seasoning in my rice.
Our server was very attentive and kept our chips replenished and our drinks filled. If you like your Mexican food on the mild side, served in a very friendly atmosphere along with excellent service, then you should give El Charro a try.

 Ray Anderson The same wonderful Italian salad and great pizza that the original Roca Bar serves is now available in Newburgh! When it&apos;s pizza time, my wife and I always opt for the Roca Bar! What I like about the Newburgh place is that it offers a better selection of lager beers, including one of my all time favorites - Carlsburg from Denmark, and what goes better with pizza than a good cold beer! A word of advice for first time customers: the salad portions are large - an individual salad will easily serve two and the salad for two will easily serve four persons. If you go to any of the Roca Bars and don&apos;t have the Italian salad and pizza you&apos;ve wasted your time!  Penne Pirkle Gambrall We LOVE the Roca Bar! For years we have considered the Kentucky Ave. Roca Bar a dining mainstay. As Newburgians we were thrilled when a Newburgh Roca Bar opened. The Italian Salad and pepperoni pizza are our most favored menu items. The Italian Salad is a taste delight. Consisting of lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, eggs, pepperoni, green and black olives, ham and a zesty italian dressing this is a salad that can&apos;t be beat. BEWARE...the small Italian Salad is more than enough for two people. The loaf of homemade herb bread which is served with all entrees is a special treat along with the salad. What can be said about a pepperoni pizza besides delicious. We always order one size larger than we can eat so we have leftovers for lunch. We have also tried the gyros and spaghetti with meat sauce. Both of these entrees were very tasty and ample in portion size. The gyro was accompanied by chips and pickle. The spaghetti was served with a small house salad. In spite of the normal full house we have never had to wait for seating as their dining area is quite large. Service is also top notch. Abundant wait staff insures that your beverage glass is always full and all of your dining needs are met. The Roca Bar offers a great product at a very reasonable price. As we have done in the past so shall we continue to patronize the Newburgh Roca Bar!  Donna Mason Archie and Clyde&apos;s Roca Bar in Newburgh offers signature and traditional pizzas with pizzazz and much more to attract all ages, i.e. large game room, plentiful poker tables, lively bar room, family dining area, extensive appetizers, specialty sandwiches, soups, entrees, desserts, drinks. On a busy Tuesday evening my husband, Ed and I started with the Roca Bar Italian salad, that is a meal itself, with iceberg lettuce, cheese, ham, chopped pepperoni, eggs, tomatoes, black olives served with a tangy Italian dressing and chewy, spicy Italian bread. For the main course we dined on a fabulous Round the World pizza with a thin, crispy crust piled high with fresh ingredients: beef, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, tomatoes. Our service was friendly, prompt and accommodating for our made to order dinner, even though they were catering to many poker players, soccer teams, sports fans, families and couples. We have been a fan of the original Roca Bar on Kentucky Avenue for years, but Archie and Clyde&apos;s is now our Roca Bar of choice.  Ron and Earlene Miller Earlene and I had recently visited the Roca Bar and were quite frankly underwhelmed by the Round the World pizza, but enjoyed the fried dill pickle appetizer. We decided to try the Roca Bar again, but we went the sandwich route this time. This time we were very pleased with all our choices. Our friend Lois Winternheimer joined us on this visit.
Earlene and I started with an order of onion rings and Lois chose fried mushrooms. The onion rings were very good with a honey mustard dipping sauce that was on the sweet side. The batter was just right; not overly greasy or soggy. The mushrooms were also prepared similarly and made for a good start to the meal. Earlene chose grilled bologna and I had the Ruben panini. The grilled bologna was a thick slice and she chose pepperjack cheese to top it. Pickle and onion
was also included. It made for a tasty combination. The Ruben panini consisted of the usual corn beef, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. The sandwich had a good flavor and was a different interpretation of the typical Ruben. Lois had the Rocaboli. She declared it to be as tasty and satisfying as any stromboli she has had in the Evansville area.
All of our sandwiches were very large and probably could make a meal for two unless you are extremely hungry. The prices are also very reasonable. We think the Roca Bar is worth the short drive to the east.  John and Lisa Robinson Normally, we wouldn&apos;t drive very far to go to a sports bar, but Newburgh&apos;s Roca Bar proved a little extra driving paid dividends in quality food. The atmosphere was fun, with a room set aside for poker players. Get there early if you want in on that game! There are plenty of televisions, including trivia for those not as tempted by the big game. We started with the beer-battered onion rings and were very impressed with their quality. Lisa thought they may be the best onion rings she&apos;s had in this area. Lisa had the Italian Beef sandwich and was very pleased with the freshness of the beef as well as the spices used. The onions and green peppers on her sandwich were used sparingly, but to good effect. John had the Roca Boli which is a traditional stromboli and very well prepared. John opted to add pepperoni to his sandwich and enjoyed the added depth. Both of us ordered the half sized sandwich and can&apos;t imagine needing the full sized. Service was prompt and friendly and we&apos;re already making plans to go back on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and to see how we stack up on the trivia boards. All in all, a very fine local effort at a crowded market.  Eleanor Zitek and Pat Savage Monday night, Pat and I had supper at Archie&amp;Clyde&apos;s Roca Bar in Newburgh. It was our first visit. The decor is mostly sports-oriented, and the TV nearest our booth was showing &quot;Monday Night Football.&quot;
We were seated immediately, and our server, Chris, arrived promptly to take our order. We each ordered a mug of beer. Pat had Blue Moon and I had Sam Adams Octoberfest, both of which were on tap. They were cold and fresh-tasting.
Since Roca Bar&apos;s menu says the pizza is &quot;famous,&quot; that&apos;s what we ordered. We were hungry, so we ordered the 16-inch size. My half was covered with pepperoni, sausage, black olives and lots of cheese. Pat&apos;s half was topped with crumbled beef, sausage, black olives and onions.
The very hot pizza arrived quickly, still in its pan, which has little nubs on the bottom to keep the crust from getting soggy. The pizza was beautiful to look at and perfectly cooked. The crust was thin and crisp, just the way we like it.
The toppings tasted fresh and flavorful, although I thought the sausage was a little bland. We gave it our best shot, but we couldn&apos;t finish the whole pie — we had enough left for lunch.
Our server was attentive throughout the meal, checking frequently to be sure we had everything we needed. The restaurant appeared to be clean, although the carpet is worn and could stand replacing. 

 Lloyd&amp;Donna Gish, Evansville 
We went to Janbo’s on a Sunday at noon. It was quite busy but we were seated right away.
We had never been to Janbo’s because we are usually disappointed when we try a different Chinese restaurant (out favorite is Two Brothers.)
But we were pleased with Janbo’s buffet. My favorite was the cashew chicken with tender chicken and lots of cashews in a thick brown sauce. The beef broccoli was quite good, too - the beef was very tender and the broccoli was crisp - not overcooked. Lloyd enjoyed the wide variety of hot and spicy dishes. We both enjoyed the crab rangoon - perfectly fried with a slight hint of crab.
There were two varieties of friend rice: ham fried rice and chicken fried rice. Both had lots of meat.
Very reasonably priced at just under $7 including a drink.
We will definitely go back.

 Rita Hughes, Evansville 
I simply could not get enough of the Crab Rangoon at Janbo‚s. The wrapper was a tasty, crispy complement to the crabbily rich filling. Yumm-o. The egg roll was good too; I love the paper-thin wrappers and veggie filling. The Phoenix&amp;Dragon Delight I had was a happy combo of chicken and shrimp served in a brown sauce, rather than a white sauce. I guess the delight part of this dish is the addition of peanuts to the mix. Diners allergic to nuts/peanuts should be forewarned before ordering this dish. And what&apos;s this? No water chestnuts? Humph. Steamed broccoli florets framed the dish. It was okay. All in all Janbo&apos;s was a pleasant experience, but not enough to tempt me back.
  
 Ronald&amp;Earlene Miller, Evansville 
Earlene and I were joined by our friend Lois Winternheimer for the evening buffet at Janbo. This was my first visit ever. At first I thought I wouldn&apos;t care for Janbo because they didn&apos;t have salad fixings. Once I got past the hot and sour soup, I soon changed my mind. The temperature needed to be a little warmer, but the soup itself was good although a bit on the salty side. We all felt that the buffet was very good, even though it doesn&apos;t have as big a variety as soon of the other area Chinese buffets. Every item we sampled was fresh and flavorful. The beef and pork items were very
tender and tasty.
Some of the items worthy of mention are the fried scallops, fried crab meat, beef and broccoli, and black pepper salmon.
The restaurant is very clean and the decor bright and cheerful. There is one lone large fish in the aquarium near the front of the restaurant to provide some distraction while you dine. It is worth checking outif you are on the West side.
  
 Dan and Sandi Price, Herod, IL 
We haven&apos;t contributed before, but would like to put in a good word for Janbo. We have lunch there regularly and have been consistently pleased with the food, service, and value. The buffet has excellent variety and is kept fresh and attractive. Two favorite dishes are the honey chicken and the fresh green beans. We haven&apos;t tried any of the regular menu items.
The service is attentive without being overbearing. All around outstanding food at a reasonable price.
  
 Marsha Segebarth, Hanson, Ky. 
I teach at USI and a friend and I have eaten there several times. The selection on the lunch buffet has always been extensive, the food hot and they have some of the best crab rangoons I have tasted. My favorite Chinese dish is the green beans with sesame seeds. They always have them and, again, are quite good. The service is hard to assess since it is a buffet, but the waiters are fairly good about refilling drinks in a timely manner. As I said, I have eaten there several times and look forward to going again. I think it is a very reasonably priced and good quality
lunch.

The buzz
The Hornet’s Nest is one of the oldest restaurants in the area. First built in the mid-1800s as a tavern/hotel/dance hall, The Hornet’s Nest was a “watering hole? for folks in the area — and (no surprise here...) it also was home to an annual hive of hornets.
After a fire in the mid-1920s destroyed the original building, the current site was constructed and has been a popular restaurant since that time. Owners Linda and Jon Fink, who’ve owned The Hornet’s Nest for seven years, have honed a menu that’s been customer-friendly for decades.
“If I had to choose our most popular dish, I’d have to say prime rib,? Linda Fink said. “The fried chicken is great, and the hand-cut filets are wonderful, and the orange roughy is really good. But I think most people would say we’re pretty famous for our prime rib.?
Fried chicken lovers — and there are many of them in this area — have long considered The Hornet’s Nest’s to be among the best. “We have our chicken delivered fresh every day. We’re still old-school in that way. It’s a long-time favorite and we don’t see any reason to change a thing.?
While beef, chicken and fish are specialties, Fink said there’s plenty on the menu for vegetarians — from specialty salads to steamed veggies to fettucine Alfredo.
Joe Wagner has been the head cook for 18 years, which Fink said is “just perfect, because nobody likes change. We spoil our regulars — and always want to get in new ‘regulars’ to spoil. People who haven’t been out here, who haven’t taken a nice drive to experience our country atmosphere, are in for a treat.?
Eating out
By Matt Rowe n Dining Club member — web.courierpress.com/diningclub
The Hornet’s Nest is one of Evansville’s classic taverns, perhaps a true representation of our regional cuisine. It’s been on the corner of Boonville-New Harmony and Petersburg roads, in an area also known as Earle, Ind., since the mid-1800s. 
Today the Hornet’s Nest is a neighborhood place where McCutchanville residents stop for a beer after work, golfers drop by after a day on the course, and entire Little League teams eat fried chicken after a game. 
You are as likely to run into your attorney as you are to run into the guy who cuts your lawn.
We like to go to the Hornet’s Nest in the evening, when sandwiches are available, but we also can order classic tavern fare and more, including steaks, chicken, seafood and pastas. We usually reserve a table in the bar. 
There also is an adjacent family room, several times larger than the bar area. 
On a Thursday evening visit, our party had a cocktail at the bar until we were seated in a booth for our 8 p.m. reservation. 
I ordered some things for us to share while we looked at our menus. 
We sampled a basket of chicken livers ($7.75) and some onion rings ($5.75). Someone suggested I could not write a Hornet’s Nest review without eating chicken livers. I took this as a good excuse to have them as an appetizer and still eat a steak. They came to the table hot from the fryer, crispy and not too greasy. I requested hot sauce for mine.
Onion rings at the Hornet’s Nest are a house specialty. They are made from big onions with a tempuralike batter. These also came to us nice and hot and perfectly golden brown. Be sure to try them if you go. 
After we placed our dinner orders, we were served salads. We had Caesar salads all around. I have always liked the Caesar at the Hornet’s Nest. 
The dressing is creamy and ample, tossed with lettuce and topped with big, crunchy croutons and grated parmesan cheese.
My next course was one of my favorite suppers: a filet and french fries. Steaks come with a house or Caesar salad and one side item. You may order the 10-ounce King Filet ($21.95) or the 6-ounce Queen Filet ($18.95).
I chose the smaller cut, having just eaten almost a whole basket of chicken livers. I prefer my steak “a la Earle,? that is, with sauted onions, mushrooms and red and green peppers. 
The steaks here are not heavily seasoned or marinated. They are always cooked to the specified temperature; my medium-rare was properly pink. The skin-on fries are perfect, and, like the onion rings, hot and crispy.
Another in our party was very pleased with his New York strip ($19.95). My friends know I cannot resist the peanut butter pie ($3.75), and were surprised when I declined a piece, being too full. 
Of course, there is more than tavern food available. 
The menu has Pastas, such as fettuccini alfredo, seafood, including baked orange roughy and grilled salmon, and chicken dishes such as chicken piccata, marsala and Rockefeller, and several soups, including a soup of the day. 
There also are nightly dinner specials, often some combination of other menu items, such as surf and turf. And a Sunday brunch buffet ($10.95 for adults, $5.95 for children up to age 10) is served Sundays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
At lunch, the menu is limited to sandwiches, salads and daily lunch specials. 
Don’t go to the Hornet’s Nest looking for a fancy night out. There is a jukebox and a big TV in the bar, where smoking is still allowed.
Service is attentive and friendly, although servers are sometimes very busy during peak business hours. 
After our dinner last week, we left fully satisfied.

 Larry&amp;Cindy Farmer Cindy, myself and another couple had Friday night reservations at 6:30pm.  As usual, Mike ,the dining room manager ,seated us promptly.  Unfortunately, we were seated by the bar door where noise and comotion was a bit of a distraction. But this part of the ambiance of a tavern. I had the Fried Catfish special  with German Fries and side salad for $14.95.  The service and food were very good...as usual,  ( Before we knew each other,  Cindy&apos;s family and my family considered a dinner at the Hornet&apos;s Nest to be a real treat and came often.)
After changing ownership several times over the years, the present owner&apos;s seem to have found a  successful menu and service combination.( In the old days, it took for ever to get your food. ) Cindy calls the Hornet&apos;s Nest&apos;s petite filet mignon her favorite . We both feel a warm fuzzy about a night at the Hornet&apos;s Nest. It  is well worth the drive !  David and Penne Gambrall, Newburgh David and I recently sauntered over to the Hornet&apos;s Nest on a recent Monday evening. We never expected to be greeted to such a large crowd of fellow diners on a Monday evening....it was packed! Due to this the service was a little slower than usual but our dinner was well worth the wait. We started off with an order of Mushroom Caps. Four large mushrooms filled with crab meat were served in a casserole dish and covered with stringy melted cheese. The filling was quite zesty. David ordered the Chicken Marsala. This 
entree was served on a bed of fettuccine and was quite large in portion. There was a generous serving of mushrooms mixed into the sauce. Overall it was quite delightful. This entree was served with a side salad of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and your traditional salad ingredients. I am not usually a fried chicken fan. I noticed a fellow diner with an order of chicken and decided I needed to broaden my horizons. It was delicious. I ordered the 1/2 white which included 2 breast and 2 wings. The chicken was fresh our of the cooker and was extremely hot which made for extra crispiness. I selected mashed potatoes as my side. Delicious meal, good value, a little out of the way for two Newburgians but well worth the trip!  Lloyd (&quot;Butch&quot;) and Donna Gish, Evansville I have to admit I was skeptical about going to the Hornet&apos;s Nest. I just don&apos;t like the atmosphere of a tavern&apos;s family room - noisy, old, dark, cigarette smoke wafting from the bar.
All true of the Hornet&apos;s nest, but the food was wonderful!
Butch enjoyed his breaded tenderloin sandwich and frenchfries. I enjoyed the fried chicken - the best I&apos;ve hadsince mom&apos;s.  Ronald&amp;Earlene Miller, Evansville Earlene and I were joined recently by our friend Lois Winternheimer for an early evening meal.Earlene and I both had the half pound Earle burger.
Earlene chose German fries and I had French fries.Lois had the chicken tender dinner. Earlene and I found our burgers to be tasty and theaccompanying potatoes were also quite good. Lois said the chicken tenders were the best she has tasted yet. The accompanying gravy and the greenbeans, which contained bits of ham, were also outstanding.
Our server was attentive and additional staff came around to see that our drinks were kept filled. It is easy to see why the Hornet&apos;s Nest is such a popular place to dine.  Bob and Janice Lincoln, Boonville, Ind. This was our first visit to the Hornet&apos;s Nest. Bob and I were joined by our son, Todd and his girlfriend Melissa.
The Hornet&apos;s Nest was build in the mid 1800&apos;s and served as a tavern, hotel and dance hall. Following a fire in 1926 the present building was constructed.
We all decided to try the Sunday buffet, which is served from 11-2 p.m. (10.95)
The buffet includes an all you can eat salad bar, fried chicken, farm raised catfish, ham, various vegetables, and prime rib. Breakfast and made to order omelets are also available on the buffet. Between the four of us we sampled most of the items offered. Todd especially enjoyed the breakfast offerings; french toast sticks, sausage, biscuits, and milk gravy. Besides the prime rib, ham, fish and fried chicken, fried chicken livers and gizzards were also available. The salad was just average, however the rest of the food was tasty (the biscuits were great, with a buttery taste) and we throughly enjoyed our meal. Bob had the prime rib which he said was excellent. Desserts of various cobblers are also included in the buffet. The service was above average, the waitress kept our glasses full and promptly removed empty plates.  Overall it was a fun dining experience although some of the entree items were not as hot as we would have liked.  Tom&amp;Linda Mioduszewski, Henderson, Ky. We visited the Hornet’s Nest near the end of the Sunday Brunch Buffet, but chose to order from the menu. The salad ingredients were fresh and included tomatoes that were home grown and delicious. Tom had the Chicken Rockefeller. We would rate the food somewhere between average and good. If we lived nearby we might drop in on occasion as the prices were reasonable, but we probably won’t go out of our way to visit.  John and Lisa Robinson, Evansville Our visit to the Hornet&apos;s Nest reminded us of a lot of other small-town staples. The no-frills atmosphere matched the small-town feel of the wait staff and decor. While seemingly geared for an older customer base, the menu would appeal to most. While traditional steak and potato meals fill the menu, we chose sandwiches. Lisa had the French Dip which was a rather large sandwich heaped with well prepared roast beef. John ordered the half-pound burger and was not disappointed with the quality of the meat or the freshness of the dress items. Both of us ordered fries and were quite pleased to discover they had a &quot;home-made&quot; quality to them. We decided to cap our meal with a piece of coconut cream pie and would recommend the trip to anyone if only for that and coffee. Our pie was very fresh with a wonderfully light crust. The Hornet&apos;s Nest is a bit out of the way, but well worth the trip.  Ellen Roper We went there on a Friday for lunch. The place was already crowded at 11:30am. We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. It seemed she knew everyone in the place, asking about their health and their kids starting school. It is a very friendly place with lots of character(s).
We tried a couple of the lunch specials for $5.25 each. I had the fried cod, with macaroni and cheese, baked beans and cole slaw. Mike had the fried German bologna sandwich with fries. I ordered my dinner without the baked beans and they made up for that by giving me an extra helping of the macaroni and cheese. It had a nice white sauce and flecks of parsley in it, very tasty. The cole slaw was the sweet and sour variety, not really anything special, but it was fresh. The fried cod was a little overdone. The crust on it was pretty tough. But it was still good considering the amount of people going through the restaurant at that time. Mike said his sandwich was very good and the pepper cheese was a nice touch. The French fries were very hot, having just been prepared. 
It was a pleasant afternoon and the service was good. We have always been pleased with our visits to the tavern. I am sure we will return.  Susan and Gary Thomas, Henderson, Ky. We dined at the Hornet&apos;s Nest on a Sunday afternoon about 1:30. By the time we arrived the buffet had been pretty much emptied so we opted to eat from the menu. Susan chose the sherried chicken on a bed of rice with a Caesar salad. They both had a good flavor but nothing out of the ordinary. Gary had a bowl of chili and a fish sandwich. The chili was very thick and spicy with lots of beans and was very good. The fish sandwich was two small chunks of white fish. Good flavor but on the small side. We wouldn&apos;t mind trying the
buffet if we were in the area, but a little far for us to make a special trip.  Scott Wheeler, Evansville I dined at The Hornet’s Nest recently on a Wednesday evening, accompanied by my fiancée Brooke. Having been some time since my last visit, I had forgotten how busy they are during the week. Still, service was excellent throughout the evening. For dinner, I ordered the fried chicken, which is a personal weakness of mine. The fried chicken was typical tavern quality, which means it was good. The chicken along with the baked potato was flavorful and piping hot. Brooke ordered the fried fish dinner, and both of us believe that the fish was as good as can be found in the area. I believe the variety of the menu is also very impressive, including steaks and Italian dishes. I look forward to returning to sample other items, as I don’t ever remember leaving the Hornet’s Nest disappointed. 

No, it’s not that F’s ...
F’s Steak&amp;Seafood House will be adding more specialties to the menu within the next few weeks, and no one who knows owner Franco Mannino will be surprised that most of the additions are pastas.
Mannino opened F’s in the Apple Center in Newburgh in May and already is tweaking the menu “because it is the right thing to do once you get to know your customers.?
He’s owned several restaurants in Evansville and Newburgh, beginning with Franco’s on Main Street shortly after he arrived here from Sicily (and a couple of years in Philadelphia).
“When we started Downtown, people didn’t know Italian (cuisine) real well,? Mannino said. “I had fettuccine Alfredo on the menu, and no one knew what it was, so it didn’t sell well. I’d tell (customers) it’s a creamy parmesan sauce, and they’d just look at me and order spaghetti. Then Olive Garden opened and their advertising helped people understand us. Now Evansville knows Italian.?
Mannino said it was just time for him to open a new restaurant with a new specialty, but he laughs when people think the restaurant was named after the old F’s restaurant in Downtown Evansville, which closed in 1993 after more than 40 years as a culinary landmark.
“Hey, my name is Franco. ‘F’ is my initial. I already have a Franco’s, so this one is F’s.
“Besides, that F’s closed a long time ago. Most of my customers don’t even remember that F’s. And those who do — I want them to like my ‘F’s’ as much as the other one.?

Readers comments posted on Canton Inn Dining review
 

 Stacy Heuer, Dining Club Member 
I am not a fan of buffets, but the Canton Inn managed to overcome some of my usual complaints about buffets in general. Unlike most places, the food was hot and kept replenished despite a very large lunch crowd. The choices on the buffet provided a wide range of options (not everything was chicken!) and each dish had distinct flavors. Beef with cabbage and pork with cauliflower are a few of the more unusual dishes. The quality of the food was good and the dessert options, including soft ice cream, were a nice touch. The waitress kept our drinks refilled and quickly removed the dirty plates. I still prefer a sit down meal to a buffet, but this is certainly a step above most other buffets in town.

gibcohik you may be on to something. There is a nail salon next to Janbo also:)

 Susanne Ashby of Evansville 
My husband and I found the lunch buffet at the Canton Inn most enjoyable both in food and service. Although there is a lunch and dinner buffet, you also have the option of ordering from an extensive menu.There are two soups and several appetizers to compliment a wide range of many entrees. The entrees include dishes of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, vegetables, fish, and desserts. What we like most about this buffet is the freshness, variety, and delicious sauces. The salty chicken is not to be missed. We will return again often.
  
 David&amp;Penne Gambrall of Newburgh 
This was our first visit to the Canton Inn. Having passed by it&apos;s North Park location we were totally unaware that the Canton Inn was primarily a buffet. The service was prompt and efficient. Beverage glasses were kept full and used dishes were promptly removed from the table. The buffet offerings were fresh and well prepared. The variety of dishes were diverse and should appease most appetites. The offerings were traditional chinese cuisine..nothing out of the ordinary. The egg rolls were outstanding. They were reminiscent of the egg rolls at the House of Chong. Always delicious! The sweet and sour sauce was light and had a very unique flavor. The dessert area consisted of soft serve ice cream, cookies and canned cling peaches. This area left a lot to be desired. Our meal was fine but we probably won&apos;t return as there are many other Chinese restaurants with similar fare much closer to home.

Judging from the long line of customers waiting for a table, and more coming
in the door as we left, it appears as if the Canton Inn is a popular spot,
with a lot of repeat customers. Given the experience we had, it is difficult
to believe why anyone would want to return.
We arrived to a nearly empty restaurant, with only one other table in use.
There were half a dozen empty tables, cluttered with dirty dishes, used
napkins, empty glasses, and the like. Instead of greeting us, the hostess
merely waved her hand, and gestured towards the tables, as if inviting us to
take a seat, which we did. After a wait of approximately ten minutes, the
hostess came over to ask if our waitress had taken our drink order. She
hadn&apos;t, so the hostess took our order and served our beverages.
The Canton Inn is yet another in a long and growing list of buffet-style
restaurants offering Oriental fare. The buffet featured the standard
offerings found on most Oriental buffets - egg rolls, crab rangoon, and any
number of chicken, beef, and pork entrees, accompanied by various vegetables
and sauces. Dan selected an egg roll, a couple of crab rangoon, Sweet&amp;Sour
Chicken, General Tso&apos;s Chicken, and a few deep fried shrimp. The egg roll
was okay, but had a rubbery and chewy consistency. The crab rangoon was
crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, with a smooth flavor that
was not overpowering. The Sweet&amp;Sour Chicken wasn&apos;t anything special, but
was rather bland. The General Tso&apos;s Chicken, which is usually a hot and
spicy dish at most Oriental restauarants, tended to the sweet side, with no
spice at all. The fried shrimp were tasteless and rubbery.
Lou Ann sampled an egg roll and the crab rangoon, along with some of the
Sweet&amp;Sour Chicken, the Chicken&amp;Broccoli, and the Mongolian Pork. The
Sweet&amp;Sour Chicken seemed overly sweet, while the Chicken&amp;Broccoli was
tasty, although the broccoli was cold. The best dish was the Mongolian Pork,
which had pork, mushrooms, carrots, and other vegetables in a rich brown
sauce. The Fried Rice was average tasting, but had a bland appearance. The
Egg Drop Soup, a usual favorite, was passed on due to the unappetizing
appearance of congealed eggs floating in a dishwatery looking broth.
It would be nice to say that the service was lackluster, but that would be
an exaggeration. It was nearly non-existent. Our waitress did not approach
the table until at least 20 minutes into our meal, and then only to ask if
we wanted beverage refills (&quot;More water, more soda?&quot;). We received better
service from the two busboys who spent most of their time keeping the buffet
stocked.
With the availability of a multitude of Oriental buffet restaurants in our
immediate, it&apos;s not worth driving across town for a return visit.

Below average food, non-existent wait service, and the lack of Diet Coke means we won&apos;t return. And to top it all off, we didn&apos;t even get a fortune cookie!

It was a 4 on a 1-5 food scale. I didn’t like the strawberry cake, though. Everything was warm, and the salty chicken had just the right amount of salt. The sweet tea, no lemon, tasted like it already had lemon—they just pulled it out. The potato circles were not as cheesy as usual, but they were still excellent. The chow mein was hard, but what do you expect? It’s not chow mein if it’s not hard. The waitress we got was really cool. So basically, my experience at Canton Inn was great!

The visit to the Canton was pleasant, but nothing special. We arrived on a Sunday evening. There was a buffet set up, but we were told we could order from the menu. We decided to try the buffet since it was well stocked with a variety of foods. Everything was tasty and the price was quite reasonable. The décor was simple. If we are in the North Park area we might return.

The buffet ($6.42 for adults, including drink) was fairly well stocked, but a few items had gone empty. What is usually one of Canton Inn’s standout items, the General Tso’s Chicken, was just average on this visit. It seemed a little mild, with not as much spiciness as in the past.
The same could be said for the Lemon Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both lacked that certain kick that usually sets them apart from other entrees.
However, not to be disappointed, the Cashew Chicken was excellent. The chicken was juicy and succulent, with just the right blend of peas, water chestnuts, celery, and other vegetables. It tasted freshly made and was delicious.
The best item of the day was the terrific Crab Rangoon. As usual, Canton Inn came through. They were fresh tasting, with the perfect combination of crispy outside and delicious, creamy inside. Canton Inn’s Crab Rangoon is the some of the most delicious around. I would rate Canton Inn a 4 out of 5.

We visited the Canton Inn on a Sunday Afternoon. There was a small crowd and we were seated quickly. The Main fare is a buffet which we chose, however you can order from the menu. There were ample choices of chicken with fewer beef or pork dishes. The Fried rice was very good. While the Hot and Sour soup appeared to have been on the buffet a little too long it had an excellent flavor and consistency. The Canton Inn follows in the path that most Chinese buffets and did not offer anything in particular that would make it stand out from the others.

Chinese Offerings are tasty, best in town


We visited the Canton Inn at 12:30 p.m. on a Monday, and we were greeted quickly and had our choice of seats. It was not crowded.
Our waitress brought our drinks swiftly. Both sweet and unsweetened tea were available. We waited about five minutes before we were asked if we were having the buffet. I asked for a menu and requested the Lobster Fried Rice along with Cantonese fried shrimp.
Our waitress said they had not had lobster for about a month. She checked to see if that had changed, but it had not. I was disappointed, but I decided to order the shrimp and have the buffet.
I tried two egg rolls. The first was not warm, and both the second and first were hard and tough. I would have used the hot mustard sauce, but it was hidden under a tray full of plum sauce and was not easily accessible. The Crab Rangoon, however, was excellent.
For my meal, I sampled the Sweet and Sour Chicken, which I thought was better than average. The Lemon Chicken was not as tasty as usual, and the General Tso Chicken was bland and flavorless.
Later I tried the Pork lo Mein and the fried rice. The pork was good but the rice was tasteless. I also sampled the Mongolian Pork, which was average. The green beans — two helpings! — were crisp and delicious.
The Cantonese fried shrimp came during my second visit to the buffet, and was of perfect consistency — it was not too greasy and was delectable. I used the plum sauce for dipping. I’m always too full to try any of the desserts.
I waited, a bit impatiently, for my tea to be refilled. Our waitress mistook the 10-year-old with us for older and had to fix the total to account for the discounted price ($5.89 instead of $6.42). To my displeasure, I could not get a to-go cup for my tea unless I paid $1.
The waitress said that for the last six months, they were planning to split the cost of the buffet with the drink so that there would be no cost for to-go beverages.
We were not offered chopsticks or fortune cookies, but the waitress, who seemed to be waiting on a big portion of the restaurant patrons, was fairly attentive and in good humor.
The overall appearance of the food was attractive, the cleanliness was fine, and the value of the meal was very good.
My meal, for the ordered shrimp and buffet was $11.32.
I will definitely return to Canton Inn because I think it’s the best Chinese food in Evansville.
Editor’s note: The Canton Inn can trace its origins back to the beginning of Chinese food in Evansville.
Shum “Sam? Seto, first worked at F’s Steakhouse and then later with his sister, the late Lai Wah “Lily? Chong, at the House of Chong.
Seto’s grandson, Yim Seto, also worked at the House of Chong before opening the Canton Inn in North Park 23 years ago. The restaurant continues to be a family affair with daughter, Mary, and aunts and uncles all working in the restaurant.
The focus is on Cantonese cuisine, but Mary says her favorites are the spicy curries and Hunan dishes.
