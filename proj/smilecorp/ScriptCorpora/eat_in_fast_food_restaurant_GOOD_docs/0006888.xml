 A Red Hot Favourite? 

 Advantages: Huge Variety Of Food, Great Layout and Decoration
 Disadvantages: Poor Service At Lunchtime


...When Red Hot Buffet opened in Leeds, I was extremely excited. As someone who loves food and never fails to be spoilt for choice when sat at a restaurant staring at the menu, a place where you can go and not only eat as much as you like, but also taste almost every type of food there is, was always going to be good news for me (although perhaps not for my waistline!).

 Where is it? 

Red Hot is a small chain of restaurants situated up and down the country, with restaurants in Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Northampton and Nottingham. The fact that there isn?t one in every nook and cranny of every town, for example like Nando?s or Pizza Express, makes it all the more special, in my opinion, although it does mean that those of you who don?t live near one are missing out!

 The Cockpit - Leeds 

 Advantages: great drink deals, variety of nights, music gigs
 Disadvantages: small, toilets


...of the Stoneage, My Chemical Romance, Hot Chip, Bloc Party and Fall out Boy. The club still seeks out to find new and exciting bands who are starting there music career who could go on to be as big as the bands previously mentioned. Music gigs can be any night of the week on any 3 stages the Cockpit has to offer from bands from Leeds or on a national and even internal scale, with bands ranging from indie, rock, heavy metal, electro, skater/punk there is something for every type of music lover. Music gigs usually start around 8pm and are always finished before 10.30pm so that the club can open as a nightclub. 




The Cockpit has 3 rooms within the venue which means it gives the club more variety and more to experience. The first room is called ?The Pit? which is the biggest room holding 500 people; this is where most music gigs will take place...

Review of Leeds Cockpit 
 
 Lovely Leeds Hotel 

 Advantages: Great location, beautiful rooms
 Disadvantages: Entrance is not very obvious from main road


...I stayed at the Park Plaza hotel in Leeds in August 2009 when I visited a friend in Leeds. 

Booking 
I booked online through the Park Plaza website. I found the website easy to use and thought that it was well laid out, making it easy for me to choose the room I required. I decided on the entertainment package offer which was 89 for bed, breakfast, a bottle of wine and free movies. I thought this offered pretty good value for money considering I was staying in the middle of the town centre. 

Location 
I thought the location of this hotel was excellent, right in the centre of the city. Parking was sadly a little bit away from the hotel at the Q Park in Criterion Place, which is discounted for Park Plaza guests. You are given a discount code upon check in. I found the car park to be secure and it was only about a 5 minute walk...
