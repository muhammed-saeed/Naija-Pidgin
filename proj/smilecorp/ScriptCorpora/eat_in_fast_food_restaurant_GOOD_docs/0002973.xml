McDonalds Interview Questions
 The interview was easy and fast. I wore casual business attire. I was asked if I had any experience with children. This was my first job, at age 16, but I told the interviewer about my 19 nieces and nephews. I was asked if I had reliable transportation and if I had any issues with wearing the rubber Hamburglar suit. 
 Salary and Benefits 
 Salary - McDonalds, Ronalds Ranger is $7/Hourly. 
 Working Conditions The atmosphere is happy, clean, and safe. McDonald&apos;s is probably the world&apos;s most famous fast food restaurant, so I had been there several times before working there, and I knew what to expect. My coworkers&apos; attitudes toward the employer ranged from apathy to disgust. Most of my peers were also teenagers who found it difficult to respect an adult who chose to make a career in fast food. 
 Physical Requirements The heaviest thing we lifted was a birthday cake, but there was a considerable amount of crawling on your hands and knees inside the play tubes, while armed with spray sanitizer and cleaning rags. I once had to clean up vomit and diarrhea from the same child in the tubes. That was the last day I was employed as a Ronald Ranger. 
 Other McDonalds Job Information This job was fine for a teenager&apos;s first employment. This is not a job anyone would set as a life goal.
