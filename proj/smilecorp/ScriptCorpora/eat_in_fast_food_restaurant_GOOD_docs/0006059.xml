 Distributor,&quot; the contents of these applications are incorporated herein
 by reference for all purposes.

 BACKGROUND 

 [0003] Retail transactions typically include several
 component-transactions, such as: (i) receiving one or more orders for
 goods and/or services, each particular order referred to as an order
 component, (ii) receiving payment for those goods and/or services, (iii)
 delivering the ordered goods and/or services or otherwise fulfilling the
 order, or a combination thereof. The location at which one or more of
 these component-transactions occurs is known as the point of sale
 (&quot;POS&quot;). In many retail environments the point of sale also serves as a
 point of order entry, the point of payment and/or the point of order
 fulfillment. For example, retail stores often integrate order entry
 points, i.e. POS terminals, such as integrated order input/cash
 registers, with a restaurant POS system (&quot;RPOS&quot; system), e.g. a system,
 typically including a network and server, which interconnects the POS
 terminals with displays or terminals in the production area to convey and
 track orders, etc. under the management of appropriate software. Orders
 are typically entered into the POS system via the POS terminal, such as a
 cash register, inside the retail store. In other implementations, order
 entry, order payment and order fulfillment may occur at multiple
 different points/locations, as will be described below.

 [0004] Exemplary retail stores include restaurants, such as a quick service
 restaurant or a fast food restaurant, where a customer may, for example,
 verbally convey orders to a cashier located at a counter inside the
 restaurant. Upon receiving the order, the cashier enters the order into
 the RPOS system via the POS terminal. The POS terminal, which may be an
 integrated order input/cash register that calculates the total price,
 transmits the order to the kitchen staff. The POS terminal (often
 referred to as a &quot;point-of-sale register&quot;, or &quot;POS register&quot;) often
 includes a POS terminal user interface having custom hardware and/or
 software and, in a many implementations, includes virtual or physical
 buttons or keys representing each of the various items offered for sale.
 This simplified order entry interface streamlines and accelerates the
 order entry process as well as minimizes errors therein. In this manner,
 the cashier/counter person, upon hearing a customer order a specific
 item, need only push the button or key corresponding to that item,
 thereby entering the specific item ordered in to the RPOS system and
 recording the corresponding price for totaling purposes. The customer
 then typically pays for the food and in response; the cashier/counter
 person delivers the food to the customer.

 [0005] Rather than place an order with a counter clerk at a POS terminal
 from within a restaurant, a customer may place their order from a remote
 POS location. For example, a remote POS location may be a drive-through
 order placement system; a computer based ordering kiosk or a telephone
 coupled or otherwise in communication, with an order taker/cashier at a
 POS terminal within the restaurant via a dedicated connection. A
 drive-through POS location may include a speaker post and feature signage
 showing the restaurant menu, i.e. menu board. The cashier/order taker
 within the restaurant, upon hearing the order, may then enter the
 customer&apos;s order into the RPOS system via their POS terminal. For
 example, a customer may drive their car to a location proximate to the
 speaker post and menu board. The menu board lists the available items for
 order and their prices. An audio system connected to the speaker post
 allows two-way communication between the customer and the order
 taker/cashier located inside the building. Further, the audio system also
 may allow other staff in the restaurant to monitor the communication
 between the customer and the order taker/cashier. In response to the
 customer&apos;s verbal menu selections, the cashier enters the order into the
 POS terminal. The cashier verifies the customer&apos;s order and typically
 tells the customer the total amount owed. This arrangement provides the
 customer with the convenience of placing and picking up orders without
 leaving their car, and allows the restaurant to serve customers using two
 avenues: inside and drive-through. After placing their order and
 receiving their total, the customer drives to a window in the building
 where he may speak with the attendant face to face, pay the amount owed
 and subsequently receive the ordered food or merchandise.

 [0006] While conventional drive-through order placement systems offer the
 advantages of customer convenience and increased product delivery
 channels, there are several disadvantages to such systems. For example,
 the lack of adequately trained cashier/counter agents often leads to
 errors in taking orders. Such errors lead to customer irritation and
 annoyance and may further lead to, or compound with, other errors
 resulting in unacceptable delays in servicing customers and, potentially,
 lost customers, lost goodwill and lost revenue. Unfortunately, the labor
 pool for such establishments is shrinking at the same time that demand is
 increasing. Identifying, training, retaining and scheduling courteous and
 capable personnel is becoming one of the most critical concerns in the
 management of restaurants. This is particularly true in quick
 service/fast food restaurants. Such establishments emphasize the delivery
 of food in a consistent, timely and relatively inexpensive manner, while
 delivering consistently high quality products. Effective and capable
 employees are a prerequisite for achieving each of these goals.

 [0007] It would be desirable to provide a system and method for addressing
 the limitations described above while streamlining the order processing
 system. Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide an order entry
 interface that can quickly, easily and efficiently interact and cooperate
 with a remote POS location or device. The order entry interface could,
 among other things, enhance the customer&apos;s satisfaction while allowing
 the retail location, e.g., the fast food restaurant, to maximize employee
 efficiency

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

 I . System Layout and Network

 [0016] The remote order processing system 100 described herein includes
 hardware and software embodiments configured and provided to facilitate
 order taking and remote order taking for a restaurant or other sales and
 service supplier. The following section(s) describes: (i) the hardware
 associated with the remote order processing system 100, (ii) embodiments
 of potential communications layouts for such as system, (iii) system
 updating and alternate communications schema and (iv) alternate system
 architecture and layouts for use during normal operations and failure
 conditions.

 [0017] FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a remote order processing
 system 100 according to one embodiment. The remote order processing
 system 100 facilitates order intake using remote order taking agents 102
 which are located remotely from the point of sale, as will be described.
 The order processing system 100 is designed to accommodate a customer who
 places an order at a remote point of sale (&quot;POS&quot;) location 104 associated
 with, for example, a wholesale or retail store or a service location such
 as a restaurant and/or a market. The order may include one or more order
 components, i.e. one or more items, goods or services that the user
 wishes to purchase, collectively or separately, during the present
 interaction/transaction. POS locations 104 may be, for example, inside
 the store (not shown), such as a counter, a kiosk or outside the store,
 such as along a drive-through lane which allows a customer to place, pay
 and receive fulfillment of an order without leaving their automobile. The
 POS location 104 may be a speaker post, a table top device and/or a
 standard telephone where a customer at least places an order, the order
 consisting of one or more order components, e.g. for one or more goods or
 services provided by the store or restaurant. Depending upon the
 implementation, the POS location 104 may further include the point of
 payment, order fulfillment or some combination thereof. As described, the
 POS location 104 may feature a POS terminal (not shown) at which a
 counter clerk enters the order, in the case of a POS location 104 inside
 the store, or an order communication system in communication with someone
 who enters the order, as will be described below, in the case of a remote
 POS location 104, such as a drive-through.

 [0018] In one embodiment, an order taking session is initiated between a
 customer, located at a remote POS location 104, and a remote order taking
 agent 102, located in a call center or elsewhere such as in their home,
 via the detection of the customer waiting to place an order at the remote
 POS location 104. As will be described, the remote order taking agent 102
 may service multiple different retail establishments and locations, e.g.
 multiple different restaurants. A signal indicative of the customer
 detection is communicated via a connectionless protocol to an order
 distributor 106 which, in turn, identifies and selects a remote order
 taking agent 102 to handle the order. The actual communication session
 may then be subsequently initiated, in response to the agent 102 being
 selected by the order distributor 106, either by the selected remote
 order taking agent 102 with the remote POS location 104 or by the remote
 POS location 104 with the selected remote order taking agent 102. The
 selected remote order taking agent 102 may be, in turn, prompted with a
 particular normalized menu representative of one of a plurality of
 possible commodity listings, menus and/or menu items offered by the
 remote POS location 104 prior to taking the order of the customer as will
 be described. As used herein, commodities, commodity information and/or
 commodity listings describe any and all products, menu items, services
 and business rules related thereto that may be offered by a retailer or
 retail location that utilizes the disclosed remote order processing
 system 100. A commodity listing, such as a menu of products and/or
 services offered by a retail establishment, may be characterized by both
 the content/offerings of the establishment, i.e. the specific
 products/services, applicable options, modifications, promotions or other
 business rules, or groupings/packages thereof, offered for sale, as well
 as the presentation of that content to both to the customer and
 employees, i.e. the order and arrangement of the offerings including
 their visual placement, visual representations, symbology, etc. The menus
 of two or more restaurants may offer the same products/services but
 present them in different ways, such as by naming or numbering the
 products/services using different schemes. A baseline commodity listing
 refers to a commodity listing, or portion thereof, which two or more
 establishments have in common or which generally remains constant over a
 given period of time, such as day to day or month to month, and may be a
 subset of the overall commodity listing of one or more restaurants. A
 normalized commodity listing refers to a commodity listing having a
 normalized presentation which may or may not be the same as the original
 presentation of the underlying commodity listing.

 [0019] In an alternate embodiment, an order distributor 106 (a.k.a. Task
 Distribution Engine), in response to being notified of a customer waiting
 to place an order at a particular remote POS location 104, selects a
 remote order taking agent 102 to handle the order and sends at least a
 notification thereto, the selection being based on, in one embodiment, a
 criteria other than just the availability of the agent 102 to take the
 order. The additional selection criteria may include, for example,
 agent/customer compatibility, store/menu familiarity, demand, current
 store/queue status, etc.

 [0020] In yet another alternative embodiment, a remote order processing
 system 100 provides the capability of electronically communicating a
 customer articulated/vocalized order, received from a customer at the
 remote POS location 104, to the remote order taking agent 102 located
 remote from the remote POS location 104 wherein the system 100 is further
 capable of automatically or manually processing the received
 vocalizations to enhance their intelligibility. The vocalizations can be
 degraded for a number of reasons, for example, poor articulation by the
 customer, faulty or improperly maintained equipment and/or signal
 interference along the communications line or circuit.

 [0021] In yet another alternative embodiment, the remote order system 100
 is adapted for taking orders from a plurality of remote stores, each
 characterized by a particular commodity list, such as a particular menu
 offering and/or arrangement of products and/or services or
 packages/groupings thereof, particular promotions, or combination
 thereof. The remote order system 100 in this exemplary embodiment may
 include a plurality of remote order taking agents 102, each associated
 with a remote order taking terminal 108, wherein each remote order taking
 terminal 108 is capable of taking an order from each of the plurality of
 remote stores and further capable of dynamically prompting the remote
 order taking agent 102 with an interface comprising the menu, promotion,
 programmable or customizable messaging system or dialog configured to
 enhance service quality, or a combination thereof associated with the
 store from which the order is being taken. The remote order taking
 terminal 108 will typically include a PENTIUM® or OPTERON® class
 processor provided by INTEL® or ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES®
 (AMD®), respectively, a hard drive and random access memory
 configured to store and execute the order processing software. In one
 embodiment, the PENTIUM® processor may be a P4 processors configured
 to operated 2 GHz or more. The remote order taking terminal 108 can also
 include a seventeen inch (17&apos;&apos;) liquid crystal display (LCD) such as a
 model E177FP distributed by DELL®. The exemplary LCD display can, in
 turn, cooperate with the processor and a graphics card to provide
 1152×864 resolution. The remote order taking terminal 108 can be
 configured to dynamically present a unified or standardized
 prompt/interface (illustrated in FIG. 5 and described in detail in
 Section II-C) to the remote order taking agent 102 representative of the
 commodity listing, promotion or a combination thereof associated with the
 retail location from which the order is being taken, the presentation
 being similar for each menu, promotion or combination thereof for each
 store.

 [0022] In yet another alternative embodiment, the remote order processing
 system 100 for taking orders from a plurality of remote stores includes a
 plurality of remote order taking agents 102, each associated with a
 remote order taking terminal 108 capable of being coupled with an audio
 and/or visual interface located at each of the plurality of remote POS
 location 104, the audio and/or visual interface being capable of
 automatically prompting a customer, in response to the customer&apos;s arrival
 at the remote POS location 104, with a greeting, the status of the
 connection between the customer and the remote order taking agent 102,
 available promotions for the associated store, or a combination thereof.

 [0023] As will be described, the remote order processing system 100 detects
 the presence of a customer at the remote POS location 104, such as a
 drive-through POS location 104, and via a connectionless medium, (i)
 initiates an order taking session, (ii) selects the remotely located or
 remote order taking agent 102 to take the customer&apos;s order, (iii)
 establishes communications, whether over the connectionless medium or
 otherwise, between the selected remote order taking agent 102 and the
 store 146 and between the selected remote order taking agent 102 and the
 customer, and (iv) processes the order as it is received by the agent 102
 from the customer to communicate the order to the store 146 for
 fulfillment. Mechanisms are further provided to enhance the customer&apos;s
 experience, such as via optimized agent selection and/or intuitive order
 confirmation, detect and handle system failures, such as via back-up
 order in-take systems, and overall improve workflow efficiency both
 within the retail location and among multiple retail locations. In an
 alternative embodiment, the remote order processing system 100 is
 implemented so as to more easily integrate with a restaurant&apos;s existing
 technology infrastructure.

 [0024] In the present embodiment, the remote order processing system 100
 includes a remote order system interface 110, also referred to herein as
 the system interface 110, order processing device, remote order center
 (&quot;ROC&quot;) interface or &quot;ROClink&quot; interface, and one or more speaker posts
 112, 114 coupled with the system interface 110. Herein, the phrases
 &quot;communicatively coupled,&quot; &quot;in communication with,&quot; and &quot;coupled with&quot;
 are defined to mean directly connected to or indirectly connected through
 one or more intermediate components. Such intermediate components may
 include both hardware and software based components. The system interface
 110 manages order intake and processing. The speaker posts 112, 114,
 described in more detail below, are used to communicate with customers
 and, in the present embodiment, are located proximate to the respective
 remote/drive-through POS locations 104. The system interface 110 may
 further be coupled with one or more wired or wireless headsets 116, 118
 as an alternative mode for receiving an order by an employee, agent
 within the store 146. The system interface 110 is further coupled with
 the store&apos;s RPOS system 120, or a workstation component thereof, located
 within the store for processing or otherwise entering the order into the
 store&apos;s RPOS system 120 to facilitate the fulfillment of the order. The
 RPOS system 120 may include a POS server (not shown), one or more POS
 terminals or workstations (not shown), such as cash registers and/or
 order input devices, drive-thru expos, grill slip printers and one or
 more kitchen video systems (KVSs) (not shown) configured for use by the
 crews or teams charged with the order preparation and/or fulfillment. The
 RPOS system 120 may be implemented as a centralized architecture, e.g.
 using dumb-terminals coupled with a central computer, or a distributed
 architecture, e.g. intelligent terminals coupled together as peer
 devices. Alternatively, the RPOS system 120 can be implemented as a
 client server architecture, i.e. a hybrid of the centralized and
 distributed architectures, where the POS terminals and KVDs are
 intelligent devices which execute client software that interacts via the
 network with the POS server to implement the order processing/fulfillment
 applications.

 [0025] The system interface 110 is further coupled with the order
 distributor 106, which may be remote from the store. The order
 distributor 106 can be coupled with a group of remote order taking agents
 102, each located at an associated remote agent terminal 108. In one
 embodiment, the order distributor 106 selects one remote order taking
 agent 102/terminal 108 from the group for the purpose of taking the
 customer&apos;s order. The selected agent 102 then takes the customer&apos;s order
 using an audio connection established between the associated remote agent
 terminal 108 and speaker post 112, 114, via the system interface 110, as
 will be described in more detail below. The order distributor 106 may
 further be coupled with a store database 122, also referred to as a
 &quot;ROCLink store database&quot;, which contains and organizes store information
 for the plurality of stores utilizing the remote order processing system
 100.

 [0026] The speaker posts 112, 114 are in communication with and provide a
 simple interface between the system 100 and the customer, such as a
 customer present at one of the remote POS locations 104, for at least the
 purpose of taking the customer&apos;s order. For example, one or more speaker
 posts 112, 114 may be located at the store and may each be a separate
 free-standing device physically separate from the store and located along
 the store&apos;s drive-through lanes. Alternatively, one or more speaker posts
 112, 114 may be located inside the store. In one embodiment, the speaker
 posts 112, 114 may be stand alone devices including audio speakers 112a
 and microphones 112b and a suitable controller to facilitate, e.g.
 receive and communicate/relay, audible communications between the
 customer and the remote order taking agent 102 at the remote agent
 terminal 108, either directly, i.e. peer-to-peer, via the system
 interface 110, or indirectly via the order distributor 106. It will be
 appreciated that the logical and physical connections between these
 devices may differ. For example, the speaker posts 112, 114 may be
 network addressable devices in logical communication with the system
 interface 110 while physically connected to an entirely different portion
 of the system 100. Alternatively, as described above, the speaker posts
 112, 114 may directly provide audio input to the system interface 110.
 The system interface 100, in turn, manages and controls the audio
 connection between the customer and the system 100. Regardless of the
 implementation, the microphone 112b and the speaker 112a may be combined,
 e.g. the same device may serve as both the microphone and speaker in a
 half-duplex implementation or, alternatively, simply mounted within the
 same housing.

 [0027] In one embodiment, the speaker posts 112, 114 may include a
 telephone, intercom or similar device, over which the customer
 communicates audibly. The speaker posts 112, 114 may also include a
 display that provides the customer with prompts, messages, indicators
 and/or cues which enhance the customer&apos;s interactive experience and
 satisfy the customer&apos;s need for feedback, such as a visual indication of
 the order components as they are entered and, possibly, a running total
 of the price of their order and/or other information, e.g.
 advertisements, etc. Other visual indications which may be provided to
 the customer include an indication that the presence of the customer has
 been detected and that an agent is forthcoming to take their order, an
 indication that an appropriate agent is in the process of being selected
 based on, for example, the customer&apos;s dialect, an indication that the
 customer is presently connected with an agent, such as to prevent &quot;dead
 air,&quot; an indication that the customer should speak their next order
 component that they wish to order or otherwise indicate that they are
 finished ordering, an indication that there is a problem and that the
 customer should go to the service window or otherwise that assistance is
 forthcoming, or combinations thereof. Moreover, the customer may, via the
 speaker posts 112, 114, initiate the call, select or identify the
 language in which the call or display will be conducted and/or presented,
 or communicate via a voice or command recognition system embedded or in
 communication with the speaker posts 112, 114. The display may be located
 on the speaker posts 112, 114 or may be separate but proximate thereto.

 [0028] The speaker posts 112, 114 may further include signage such as a
 menu board or other display of the commodities, items and/or order
 components available for purchase, such as the restaurant menu. In one
 embodiment, a store may provide multiple speaker posts 112, 114. For
 example, with two or more drive-through lanes, each lane may have a
 speaker post 112, 114. In an alternate embodiment, the speaker posts 112,
 114 may be remote terminals for receiving an order from a customer via
 unattended customer input, taking the customer&apos;s order, for example, via
 a keypad, touch screen and/or voice recognition.

 [0029] In addition, the remote POS location 104, such as the speaker post
 112, 114, includes a presence detector 112c, 114c coupled with the
 speaker post 112, 114, which detects the presence of a customer at the
 associated remote POS location 104. Upon detection of a customer&apos;s
 presence, the presence detector 112c, 114c generates an alert signal 124,
 126 indicating the presence of the customer, i.e. a customer arrival
 alert. The presence detector 112c, 114c may further cause the display of
 a message such as, for example, a store specific promotional message, or
 other indicator to the customer to acknowledge that the customer&apos;s
 presence has been detected, e.g. &quot;your order taker will be right with
 you&quot; or &quot;please wait&quot; or other suitable message or indicator to enhance
 the customer&apos;s interactive experience, as was described above.

 [0030] In one embodiment, the signal 124, 126 is communicated to the system
 interface 110, as discussed below, to ultimately cause selection of an
 order taking agent 102 and the establishment of at least a data
 connection, e.g. a P2P connection, between the system interface 110 and
 the remote agent terminal 108. The data connection allows the remote
 agent terminal 108 to communicate with the RPOS system 120 within the
 store, via the system interface 110, what items the customer has ordered
 while, or after, the order had been placed. Further, the data connection
 can be further utilized to establish an audio connection, e.g. using
 Voice Over Internet Protocol (&quot;VoIP&quot;), between the speaker post 112, 114
 and the remote agent terminal 108. Alternatively, the audio connection
 may be established via an alternative connection or medium, such via the
 public switched telephone network, a private branch exchange, a separate
 VoIP session or other medium of communications, or combinations thereof.
 In one embodiment for use at a drive-through restaurant, the presence
 detector 112c, 114c may be of a type that detects the presence of the
 customer&apos;s automobile, such as via an inductive, magnetic, pressure,
 optical or human based mechanism. It will be appreciated that the manner
 of detecting the presence of the customer is implementation dependent and
 may include manual detection means such as the pressing of a call-button
 or detection of a vocal annunciation by the customer, e.g. a voice
 activated presence detector 112c, 114c.

 [0031] The system interface 110, in at least one aspect, acts as an
 intermediary that responds to the alert signal 124, 126 that indicates
 detection of a customer at, for example, the speaker post 112, 114. The
 system interface 110, in turn, facilitates establishment of a connection
 between the remote order taking agent 102, at their associated remote
 agent terminal 108, and the customer at the speaker post 112, 114 or
 within the store 146. The system interface 110 may be implemented in
 hardware, software or a combination thereof, and may include general
 purpose hardware, such as a personal computer or other computing device.
 In one embodiment, the system interface 110 may be implemented in
 software, so that it may be easily upgraded, modified and/or maintained.
 The system interface 110 may be a component of a POS terminal (not
 shown), located at the store, such as a standalone server or part of the
 POS server (not shown) of the RPOS system 120, located outside the store,
 or may be combined with one or more of the speaker posts 112, 114. In one
 embodiment, the system interface 110 may serve a plurality of stores. For
 example, the system interface 110 may be coupled with a set of
 restaurants located within a single city, such as a set of restaurants
 which may share a drive-thru POS location 104. In one embodiment, as
 described above, the system interface 110 receives the customer presence
 signal 124, 126 generated by the customer presence detector 112c, 114c
 based on the arrival and detection of a customer at one of the remote POS
 locations 104, such as the speaker posts 112, 114, e.g. based on an
 indication that a customer has pulled up to one of the speaker posts 112,
 114, in their car. This alert signal 124, 126 may indicate not only that
 a customer is present but at which remote POS location 104 the customer
 is located in embodiments having multiple speaker posts 112, 114.

 A . System Communications

 [0032] The system interface 110, upon receiving the alert signal 124, 126
 generated by the presence detector 112c, 114c transmits a customer
 arrival alert 128, also referred to herein as an order request, to the
 order distributor 106. The customer arrival alert 128 may be a signal
 and/or one or more messages, as will be described. In an alternative
 embodiment, the customer presence detector 112c may transmit the customer
 arrival alert 128 directly to the order distributor 106. In one
 embodiment, the customer arrival alert 128 is a data message, transmitted
 via a connectionless protocol, which indicates that a customer has
 arrived at the POS location 104 and is waiting to place an order. A
 connectionless protocol is one in which a sender transmits a message by
 addressing the message to the recipient and placing it on a network to be
 delivered based on that address, but not otherwise establishing a
 connection with that recipient prior to transmitting. The exchange of
 communications in this way, for a given purpose, is typically referred to
 as a &quot;session,&quot; a &quot;virtual connection&quot; or &quot;virtual call.&quot; Once the
 purpose has ended, the session is ended. For example, a session may be
 established for taking a particular order and once the order is complete,
 the session is ended. The customer arrival alert 128 may further include
 identification information identifying the store, the store location, the
 particular remote POS location 104 and/or the customer, as discussed
 below. The customer arrival alert 128 may implicitly specify
 identification information such as where the alert 128 is conveyed over a
 dedicated identifiable connection used only by a particular store or
 remote POS location, etc. Alternatively, the customer arrival alert 128
 may be one or more messages which explicitly specify/contain the
 identification information, or this information may be specified via a
 combination of implicit and explicit specifications.

 [0033] In an alternate embodiment, the customer arrival alert 128 may
 specify store information, also referred to herein as destination
 information, which may be used to assist the order distributor 106 in
 selecting an appropriate remote order taking agent 102 or set thereof,
 assist the selected remote order taking agent 102 in taking the order, or
 a combination thereof. Store information may include information about
 the particular store, information about the remote POS location 104
 originating the customer arrival alert 128, information about the other
 POS locations 104 at the particular store and/or information for the
 customer, such as the store&apos;s operating hours, the store&apos;s menu, as will
 be described in more detail below, the current backlog of orders, the
 current queue depth at the particular remote POS location or all/other
 POS locations, the present inventory level of particular products, the
 status of the machines used by the store to produce particular products,
 any current promotions offered by the store, the language spoken by the
 customer, or combinations thereof. As will be described, store
 information, or a subset thereof, may be selectively communicated only
 when the information has changed subsequent to a prior communication of
 that store information.

 [0034] It will be appreciated that the media over which the interactions or
 communications such as, for example, the alert signals 124, 126, the
 customer arrival alert 128, the signals or communications 130, 132, 134
 between the order distributor 106, the remote agent terminal 108 and the
 system interface 110, and all other connections described herein, may
 include wired or wireless connections, including wired networks, wireless
 networks, or combinations thereof. Further, wherein the
 connections/interactions are implemented over one or more networks, these
 networks may include publicly accessible networks, such as the Internet,
 a private network, such as an intranet or virtual private network (VPN),
 or combinations thereof, and may utilize a variety of networking
 protocols now available or later developed including, but not limited to,
 TCP/IP based networking protocols.

 [0035] As will be described, the system interface 110 is selectively
 coupled with a selected remote agent terminal 108, to facilitate a data
 connection between a remote agent terminal 108 and the system interface
 110, in response to receiving a session request 132 from the selected
 remote agent terminal 108, the session request 132 having been generated
 in response to the customer arrival alert 128 being received by the order
 distributor 106 and the communication thereof to the selected remote
 agent terminal 108. This data connection is referred to as a session and
 is maintained for the duration of the order taking process as described
 herein and may be closed or ended when the order taking process is
 complete. The session is established for the transfer of indicators of
 one or more of the order components from the remote agent terminal 108 to
 the system interface 110 as the remote order taking agent 102 receives
 the order components from the customer, such as from the customer over an
 audio connection, and enters those order components into the remote agent
 terminal 108, described in more detail below. The system interface 110
 may be further coupled with the RPOS system 120, as described below, to
 communicate order data, i.e. the received order component indicators, to
 the RPOS system 120 to ensure that the order is fulfilled at the store by
 transmitting or displaying the order information as discussed below. The
 system interface 110 may also facilitate an audio connection between the
 customer at the POS location 104, e.g. the speaker post 112, 114, and the
 remote order taking agent 102 at the remote agent terminal 108, allowing
 the customer and the remote order taking agent 102 to audibly
 communicate. It will be appreciated that during a P2P configuration, the
 audio communication need not flow through the order distributor 106. In
 one embodiment, this audio connection may be implemented within the
 existing session for the data connection, such as by using Session
 Initiation Protocol (&quot;SIP&quot;)/VoIP or other protocol for implementing an
 audio connection over a connectionless network. Quality of Service (QoS)
 protocols may be further implemented to ensure adequate and intelligible
 voice communications. Alternatively, the audio connection may be
 implemented outside of the system interface 110 via a separate medium of
 communication, including the PSTN.

 [0036] As described above, in response to the customer arrival alert 128,
 the order distributor 106, alone or in concert with the system interface
 110, selects a remote order taking agent 102 at a remote agent terminal
 108, from a set of remote order taking agents 102, which will then
 initiate communications with the customer via the system interface 110.
 However, in some installations of the disclosed system 100, it may be
 necessary to integrate the disclosed system 100 with an existing
 technology infrastructure, such as an existing communications network.
 Alternatively, the store 146 may have particular concerns regarding the
 security of the communications between the customer and the remote order
 taking agent 102. These concerns may be addressed by having the system
 interface 110 instead initiate the communications with the selected
 remote order taking agent 102.

 [0037] In yet another alternate embodiment, the system interface 110,
 rather than the remote order taking agent 102, initiates communications
 between the customer and the remote order taking agent 102 in response to
 the customer arrival alert 128. This permits the system interface 110 to
 exert more control over the manner in which such communications are
 implemented, i.e. security protocols, desired communication path, etc.
 Further, where the store 146 has a communications network with a firewall
 device which may block unsolicited communications, i.e. would block
 remote order taking agent 102 initiated communications, the initiation of
 communications from within the store, i.e. behind the firewall, would
 create an authorized or solicited relationship with the remote agent
 terminal 108 that allows for unimpeded communications through the
 firewall.

 [0038] In this alternative embodiment, the system interface 110 receives
 the session request 142 from the order distributor 106 to set up a
 session with the remote agent terminal 108 that has been identified by
 the order distributor 106 in response to the customer arrival alert 128
 which the system interface 110 previously transmitted. The session
 request 142 may include information related to the selected remote agent
 terminal 108 that can be utilized to facilitate the establishment of at
 least a data connection between the system interface 110 and the remote
 agent terminal 108. In one embodiment, the session request 142 may
 identify a set of remote agent terminals 108 for the system interface 110
 to choose from, the set being selected as described herein. Further, via
 the same mechanism, an audio connection may also be established between
 the customer located at the speaker post 112, 114 and the agent at the
 remote agent terminal 108 via, for example, a VoIP connection.
 Alternatively, the audio connection may be established via an alternative
 mechanism, such via the public switched telephone network, a private
 branch exchange or other medium of communications, or combinations
 thereof.

 [0039] It will be appreciated that the functions of the order distributor
 106 may be integrated with the system interface 110 allowing the system
 interface 110 to select an appropriate remote order taking agent 102 in
 response to receiving a customer arrival alert 128, without first having
 to communicate with the order distributor 106. In this embodiment, there
 may be no order distributor 106 or, alternatively, the order distributor
 106 may manage and monitor the remote order taking agents 102 and supply
 such information to the system interface 110 asynchronous to the order
 taking process to update the system interface 110 to the status of the
 various remote order taking agents 102, thereby allowing the system
 interface 110 to select an appropriate remote order taking agent 102.

 [0040] In this system interface 110 initiated embodiment, the system
 interface 110 may then provide store information to the remote agent
 terminal 108 rather than this information coming from the order
 distributor 106, as described below. Alternatively, the order distributor
 106 may also be in communication with the selected remote agent terminal
 108 to, for example, provide store information or to alert the selected
 remote order taking agent 102 or remote agent terminal 108 to expect a
 session to be initiated by the system interface 110. Once initiated, the
 order process and flow of communications is similar to the
 agent-initiated embodiment. Further, the system interface 110 and/or
 order distributor 106 may provide store information to, or otherwise
 alert, one or more alternate remote order taking agents 102 to be ready
 in case of a failure of communication with the first selected remote
 order taking agent 102.

 [0041] In yet another alternate embodiment, the remote order processing
 system may include a plurality of order distributors 106. Each of the
 plurality of order distributors 106 may, in turn, be located in different
 stores or retail locations within a city, different regions and/or
 sections of the country, to provide redundancy or to serve different
 stores and restaurants or subsets thereof. The order distributor 106 may
 include a switch, router, computer programmed to distribute orders, or
 any suitable device to distribute orders or combinations thereof. The
 order distributor 106 selects a particular remote order taking agent 102
 and remote agent terminal 108 to handle an order, making its selection
 from a plurality of remote order taking agents 102 and associated remote
 agent terminals 108. This selection may be based on a number of factors
 as discussed below. The order distributor 106 may further select one or
 more alternate remote order taking agents 102 so as to anticipate any
 problems which may prevent use of the first selected remote order taking
 agent 102. As was described above, in one embodiment, the order
 distributor 106 receives identification data, at least identifying the
 store 146 or restaurant where the customer is located, from the system
 interface 110 via the customer arrival alert 128. This identification
 data is then transferred to the selected remote agent terminal 108, for
 example, to inform the remote order taking agent 102 of the location of
 the customer and/or to cause the terminal 108 to automatically display a
 store-specific interface menu, or normalized version thereof. The
 identification data may include a phone number for a call back, an IP
 address, or a directory address that identifies the store or POS location
 104 and can be utilized to establish a connection between the customer
 and the remote agent terminal 108. In embodiments where the customer
 arrival alert further includes store information, this store information
 may be similarly passed to the remote agent terminal 108.

 [0042] Store information may include data that is likely to change often,
 i.e., dynamic data, and data which is less likely to change, i.e. static
 data, or a combination thereof and different store information, or
 subsets thereof, may be sent in different customer arrival alerts. The
 order distributor 106 may be coupled with the store database 122 which
 contains and organizes store information such as, for example, commodity
 listings, etc., regarding one or more stores 146 in order to manage and
 avoid re-transmission inefficiencies and maximize and/or conserve
 bandwidth requirement. In this configuration, upon receiving a request
 from the order distributor 106 that identifies a particular store 146,
 the store database 122 can retrieve and transfer the appropriate
 commodity listing, menu or store information to the order distributor 106
 or directly to the selected remote agent terminal 108 via the store data
 lookup connection 144. Thus, it is unnecessary for the store 146 to
 provide the same information to the order distributor 106 at the
 beginning of every communication session. The store database 122 may be a
 personal computer or a computer storage device such as a hard drive. The
 store database 122 may be a separate device from the order distributor
 106 or may be part of the same device.

 [0043] As described above, the customer arrival alert signal 128 may
 include store information which has changed and for which it therefore
 may be necessary to update the store database 122. Store information may
 include the current conditions of the store, such as the availability of
 products, the number of customers waiting, the wait time for a customer
 at the store, promotion information, such as available coupons, rebates,
 or sales, or customer language information. For example, individual
 restaurants may have different menus and the order taker will need to use
 the correct menu based on the particular restaurant they are servicing.
 An example of a promotion would be if the retail location is trying to
 sell a thousand (1000) hamburgers in a single day. That information may
 need to be sent to the remote agent terminal 108 as discussed below, so
 the remote order taking agent 102 can notify the customer of the
 promotion. In the example of a drive-through restaurant, additional store
 information may include drive-through queue information (the
 determination of which is described in more detail below), such as the
 customer back-log, traffic information, weather information,
 drive-through data, and kitchen queue and/or capacity information for one
 or more kitchens in the store. For example, if there are ten (10) cars in
 the drive-through queue, that information would suggest that the order
 takers need to be extra prompt in receiving and entering the order.
 Additionally, the kitchen queue and/or capacity information may inform
 the remote agent terminal 108 that one or more of the kitchens at the
 store is behind on orders, is having equipment or staffing difficulties,
 has exhausted the inventory of a particular product and/or product
 fulfillment is delayed, e.g. the kitchen will not have French fries ready
 for five minutes, so customers should be notified of the delay in
 receiving their order if they are planning to order, or have already
 ordered, French fries. In this case, the remote order taking agent 102
 may be trained, or otherwise automatically prompted, to direct the
 customer to an alternative product choice so as to assist in alleviating
 the burden on the store or kitchen.

 [0044] As described above, dynamic data is data that is likely to change
 for each order while static data is the data that is less likely to
 change. For example, queue information such as at the drive-through or
 the kitchen queue may be dynamic data because it is likely to change at
 any given moment. Static data may include the commodity listing, menu or
 promotion information, such as available coupons, rebates, or sales,
 which is less likely to change over a given period of time, such as over
 the course of a day. In one embodiment, the local or store specific
 commodity information or store information that is transmitted with the
 customer arrival alert 128 from the system interface 110 to the order
 distributor 106 can, in most occurrences, include only dynamic data while
 the store database 122 maintains the static data such as a baseline
 commodity listing and store specific commodity listings for each of the
 plurality of stores, thus eliminating the need to transmit the static
 data for every customer, order or transaction. Further, should the static
 data change, only the updated static data needs to be transmitted with a
 subsequent customer arrival alert 128 to update the store database 122.
 The relationship between the remote agent terminals 108 and the store
 database 122 is similar to the relationship between the store database
 122 and the system interface 110, i.e. where store information is
 provided to the remote agent terminals 108, such information may be
 stored in the remote agent terminals 108 such that this information need
 only be retransmitted from the order distributor 106/store database 122
 if the information has changed.

 [0045] It will be appreciated that standard principles of data caching,
 including protocols to minimize missing in the data cache, e.g. minimum
 data block sizing, maintain data coherency and prevent stale data, may be
 implemented, including an invalidation protocol, data expiration controls
 and/or pre-emptive caching of data, e.g. transmitting static data in
 advance of any order rather than concurrent therewith. Further, P2P
 distribution protocols may be utilized allowing one remote agent terminal
 108 to obtain such data from another remote agent terminal 108 rather
 than from the order distributor 106/store database 122, such as to
 provide redundant or otherwise reliable data distribution. In determining
 when an update is necessary, a table or other database identifies what
 data has been previously sent and/or received by each of the devices,
 services, terminals and workstations comprising the system 100, so that
 the update status of each device can be evaluated and synchronized
 according to any desirable manual or automatic schedule. Alternatively,
 the system interface 110 and order distributor 106/store database 122 or
 order distributor 106/store database 122 and the various remote agent
 terminals 108 may implement a protocol whereby the data recipient
 validates its data with the source, such as by sending a conditional
 request including a checksum, hash value, tag or fingerprint unique to
 the data which the recipient already has stored which can be verified by
 the data source to determine if the recipient is presently storing stale
 data.

 B . System Updating

 [0046] In one embodiment, customer arrival alerts 128 for a particular
 retail location or restaurant are transmitted to the order distributor
 106 from the system interface 110 including store information that is
 dynamic but which could include static information has changed subsequent
 to a prior transmission, such as commodity information. The dynamic data
 can then be transmitted to the remote agent terminal 108 as required. In
 this embodiment, the static data, such as the baseline commodity listing
 or retail menu, does not need to be transmitted with each new alert 128
 because the store database 122 maintains a record of all of the static
 data associated with each retail location, chain of retail locations,
 etc. The order distributor 106 can retrieve the static data from the
 store database 122 and transmit it to the remote agent terminal 108 if
 necessary, e.g. if the remote agent terminal 108 needs to have its copy
 of the static data updated. However, as noted, the static data may need
 to be transmitted to the order distributor 106 and to the store database
 122 if it has changed, or otherwise been updated or modified. For
 example, if a store runs out of a particular item, then that may result
 in a change to the menu. The updated static information is transmitted
 from the system interface 110 to the order distributor 106 to the store
 database 122 to update its records. Alternatively, if a retail location
 decides to discontinue a promotion, such as fifty cent cheeseburgers,
 then the static information that included this promotion would need to be
 updated to indicate the promotion has been discontinued. Additionally,
 for the first transaction for a particular store, all of the static data
 will likely need to be transmitted to the store database 122 to establish
 a baseline record of the static data for that store within the store
 database 122. Alternatively, the static data could be stored in the store
 database 122 and/or distributed to the remote agent terminals 108 in
 advance of the first order via an alternative means, such as by a
 separate dedicated transmission.

 [0047] Once the order distributor 106 receives a customer arrival alert
 signal 128/order request from the system interface 110, the order
 distributor 106 selects a remote order taking agent 102 with an
 associated remote agent terminal 108 to handle the order. In one
 embodiment, the remote order taking agent 102 is a human being. In an
 alternative embodiment, the remote order taking agent 102 may be
 implemented in software, hardware or a combination thereof, such as an
 artificial intelligence based interactive voice response system. The
 remote agent terminal 108 may be a personal computer or computing device
 with a network connection as discussed below, with the appropriate
 hardware such as a headset with a microphone and earpiece for a remote
 order taking agent 102 to interact with, e.g. speak and listen to, a
 customer. A software program may present the appropriate information to
 the remote order taking agent 102, such as an on a display coupled with
 the remote agent terminal 108, to allow the remote order taking agent 102
 to properly interact with the customer and receive, validate and enter
 the order into the remote agent terminal 108. This information may
 include the list, the menu, the promotions and/or specific POS terminal
 interface screen stored on the remote agent terminal 108 or provided by
 the order distributor 106 or system interface 110.

 [0048] In one embodiment, software is provided which replicates the user
 interface, i.e., the type, position and arrangement of graphical icons
 representative of commodities and menu items, etc., of a register located
 within the actual retail location on the display of the remote agent
 terminal 108. For example, a customer inside a fast-food restaurant tells
 an employee at a restaurant what he/she would like to order and the
 employee enters the information into a register having dedicated keys for
 the item, as was described above. Likewise, the remote order taking agent
 102 is presented with a similar interface having similarly dedicated
 inputs, such as a set of virtual buttons which mimic the register
 interface. Alternatively, as will be described in more detail below, the
 software may unify or normalize the variations in the presentation of
 commodity listings or menus among the retail locations or stores 146 so
 as to present a consistent user interface to the agent 102 that reflects
 the menu variances in an intuitive manner. For example, a chain of
 related stores 146 may offer a baseline or general menu or commodity
 listing. This general menu or commodity listing may be displayed on the
 agent terminal 108 in a standard arrangement or configuration. By
 presenting a standard arrangement or configuration of the baseline
 commodity listing or menu, the agent 102 can become familiar with the
 arrangement which, in turn, will ease and speed up the order entry
 procedure by negating the need to hunt for commodities requested by the
 customer. In the event that dynamic data, including variations to the
 baseline commodity listing or menu items, is communicated to the agent
 102 or agent terminal 108, the variations can be displayed within or as a
 part of/integrated with the standard arrangement. In this way, new or
 changed information can be provided to the agent 102 without causing
 confusion or delay in the order entry process. The remote order taking
 agent 102 receives a customer&apos;s order through a data or audio connection
 and enters that order into the remote agent terminal 108 and the order
 data is then transmitted back to the store through the data connection as
 described herein.

 [0049] The remote order taking agent 102 and remote agent terminal 108 may
 be located at a variety of locations. Remote order taking agents 102 may
 be located on-site at the store or POS location 104, or may be located
 remotely therefrom such as at a remote-order center/call center or
 located in their home as discussed below. The disclosed embodiments
 permit the remote order taking agent 102 to be located away from the
 remote POS location 104 with a data or audio connection established
 between the customer at the remote POS location 104 and the remote agent
 terminal 108, as was described above. Further, as remote order taking
 agents 102 may not be directly or permanently connected with a store 146
 or POS location 104, each may handle order requests for a wide variety of
 stores 146 and/or POS locations 104. For example, individual remote order
 taking agents 102 may receive orders from a chain of fast food
 restaurants located across the country. The remote agent terminal 108 may
 take orders from different restaurant locations or even receive orders
 from different restaurant chains/brands. Alternatively, it may be
 advantageous to select order taking agents 102 that are familiar with a
 particular restaurant or that meet the criteria as discussed below. Order
 taking agents 102 may be located within the same geographic regions, e.g.
 city, county, state and/or country, as the store, or in a different
 geographic region. In one embodiment, order taking agents 102 are located
 in one or more different time zones so as to be able to provide available
 order taking agents 102, working during the normal business hours of
 their location, to take orders at any time of day from any particular
 store. This permits, for example, twenty-four (24) hour order taking
 capability without having to pay order taking agents 102 overtime or
 special pay or otherwise requiring them to work beyond their normal
 business/working hours.

 [0050] In one embodiment, there may be a remote order center (&quot;ROC&quot;), also
 referred to as a remote call center (not shown) that houses a number of
 remote order taking agents 102. The remote order center may include an
 order distributor 106 which receives customer arrival alerts 128/order
 requests that may specify a specific remote order taking agent 102 or the
 remote order center or order distributor 106 may choose an appropriate
 remote order taking agent 102. The remote order center may include its
 own order distributor 106, or the order distributor 106 may be located
 outside of the remote order center. The remote order center may house a
 number of remote agent terminals 108 wherein the order distributor 106
 selects a remote agent terminal 108 based on the characteristics of the
 remote order taking agents 102 working at the remote order center, or
 some other parameters. In an alternate embodiment, the remote agent
 terminal 108 and the remote order taking agent 102 may be located at home
 and suitably in communication with an order distributor 106, such as via
 a digital subscriber line (&quot;DSL&quot;), cable modem, dial-up or wireless
 connection. More information related to locating remote order taking
 agents 102 remotely from call centers may be found in related U.S. patent
 application Ser. No. 11/528,819 (12764-00008), captioned above.

 [0051] In one embodiment, the order distributor 106 selects a remote order
 taking agent 102 that is appropriate to handle the particular order. This
 selection may be based on the identification information and/or store
 information provided with the arrival alert 128 and/or retrieved from the
 store database 122 and further based on profile information, known or
 provided to the order distributor 106, regarding the various available
 remote order taking agents 102. For example, selection of a remote order
 taking agent 102 may be based on agent availability, store or menu
 familiarity, historical experience with the particular store, production
 demand, expertise, regional, cultural or linguistic compatibility or
 capability, order taking speed, order taking accuracy, agent seniority,
 rating (schedule adherence, etc.) or combinations thereof. Some selection
 criteria may be absolute requirements, such as language compatibility,
 while other criteria are merely preferential, such as cultural
 compatibility. In selecting a remote order taking agent 102, preferential
 criteria may be suppressed or otherwise de-prioritized when production
 demand is high and agent availability is low. For example, for a
 restaurant in Chicago, an order taker may be chosen who has a Midwestern
 or Chicago accent. A customer in the Midwest may ask about which &quot;pops&quot;
 are available, however, in the South, the customers&apos; may instead use the
 term &quot;sodas.&quot; These regional/cultural differences may be considered when
 selecting a remote order taking agent 102 and the associated remote agent
 terminal 108. Likewise, if a store is located in the South, an order
 taker with a Southern accent may be preferred. The order distributor 106
 may have access to a directory, for example maintained in the order
 distributor 106, of any potential remote order taking agents 102, which
 includes data on the availability of the remote order taking agents 102
 and information regarding their capabilities or training such as
 language, dialect, and familiarity with individual stores. This directory
 may be updated in real time to reflect remote order taking agent 102
 availability or capabilities. For example, the remote agent terminals 108
 may feature attendance tracking software which determines whether the
 remote order taking agent 102 is physically available and prepared to
 take orders via their respective remote agent terminal 108 by, for
 example, requiring the agent 102 to log in and out. The order distributor
 106 may first select an remote order taking agent 102 based on the
 availability information and secondarily on other factors as described.
 For example, if an remote order taking agent 102 needs to take a lunch
 break, then the agent 102 may notify the order distributor 106 that
 he/she is currently unavailable and the order distributor 106 will not
 select that remote order taking agent 102 until the order distributor 106
 receives a notification, i.e. the directory is updated, that the remote
 order taking agent 102 is back and that remote agent terminal 108 is
 again available. More information related to order taking agent 102
 selection may be found in related U.S. patent application Ser. No.
 11/512,899 (12764-00005), captioned above.

 [0052] As described above, individual remote order taking agents 102 may
 already have commodity listings related to each retail location or store
 146 stored in their remote agent terminal 108, either pre-loaded or as a
 result of handling a prior order from that same store, which may
 influence the selection of that remote order taking agent 102. This
 information may be reflected in the directory described above. If the
 remote order taking agent 102 has already handled a prior order for a
 particular restaurant or retail location, then he/she may be selected to
 receive subsequent orders from that same restaurant because new store
 information does not need to be transmitted to the associated remote
 agent terminal 108, saving time in readying the remote order taking agent
 102 to take the order. As discussed above, the store database 122 or the
 order distributor 106 may be storing static data for a particular store,
 which may be transmitted to the remote agent terminal 108 the first time
 that remote agent terminal 108 is selected to handle an order for that
 particular store. Subsequently, a remote agent terminal 108 with the
 appropriate static data will not need to receive the same data again,
 unless, as described, that data has changed. Therefore, the order
 distributor 106 does not need to retrieve the static data for the store
 from the store database 122 and does not need to transmit that data to
 the remote agent terminal 108. Accordingly, the order distributor 106 is
 likely to choose a remote agent terminal 108 that already has the static
 data for the particular store. As discussed above, the remote agent
 terminal 108 may still receive the dynamic data or any updates or changes
 to the static data just as the order distributor 106 receives that data.
 The selection of a remote order taking agent 102 that already has the
 static data for a particular store results in less data being transferred
 to the remote agent terminal 108, which may result in a quicker and more
 efficient response. Further, a remote order taking agent 102 that has
 taken previous orders from the store is likely familiar with the store
 and its offered commodities, menu items or products and, having received
 multiple orders from the same store, is likely to be more efficient at
 receiving and entering the order. Where the static data has changed, the
 order distributor 106 may ignore or de-prioritize the historical
 experience of the order taking agent 102 with respect to that particular
 store 146 as a selection criterion since the transmission of the static
 data will negate the advantage in selecting that particular remote order
 taking agent 102. Alternatively, historical experience may still be
 relied on even if the static data needs to be transmitted as that agent
 102&apos;s prior experience/familiarity with the particular store and/or menu
 may be advantageous despite that there may be delay in providing the
 static data.

 [0053] Once a remote order taking agent 102 and associated remote agent
 terminal 108 is selected, the order distributor 106 transmits an order
 initiation signal 130 to the selected remote agent terminal 108 that may
 include the customer arrival alert signal 128 and additional store
 information, such as the store information, static data, or dynamic data
 as discussed above. For example, if a restaurant is offering
 cheeseburgers for one dollar ($1), then that information will be
 transmitted to the selected remote agent terminal 108 along with the
 order initiation signal 130 as static data if this is the first time the
 remote agent terminal 108 has received an order from that restaurant.
 Subsequently, when the same remote agent terminal 108 receives a
 subsequent order initiation signal 130 indicating an order from that
 store 146, the cheeseburgers-for-$1 information will not be transmitted
 to the remote agent terminal 108 because the remote agent terminal 108
 already has that information. The remote agent terminal 108 may maintain
 a record of the static data for all future orders from that store 146. If
 the store 146 were to run out of hamburgers or cancel the sale, then the
 static data will need to be updated. Consequently, the next order
 initiation signal 130 received will include an update to the static
 information either canceling the promotion or updating the menu to show
 that hamburgers are unavailable. As discussed above, the order initiation
 signal 130, in the agent initiated embodiment, will cause the remote
 agent terminal 108 to initiate the connection with the system interface
 110 and/or remote POS location 104. Alternatively, in the store interface
 initiated embodiment, the order initiation signal 130 may alert the
 remote agent terminal 108 of the expected session initiation by the
 system interface 110 or, alternatively, the order initiation signal 130
 may come from the system interface 110 as part of the session initiation.

 [0054] In an alternate embodiment, the static data is updated in the store
 database 122 and not with the remote agent terminal 108, where the remote
 agent terminal 108 receives all of the static and dynamic data with each
 order initiation signal 130. Such a scenario may be necessary if, for
 example, the order distributor 106 oversees a very large number of stores
 and remote order taking agents 102. The system may function more
 efficiently by choosing remote order taking agents 102 based only on
 availability. In this embodiment, the dynamic data and the static data is
 transmitted to the remote agent terminal 108 for each order from each
 store 146. Accordingly, the remote agent terminal 108 would not need to
 record the static data for individual stores because that data is
 transmitted for each order.

 [0055] The order initiation signal 130 from the order distributor 106 to
 the selected remote agent terminal 108 may also include contact
 information for the store, which the remote order taking agent 102 and/or
 remote agent terminal 108 may use to establish a connection with the
 store and specifically, a connection with the customer. The selected
 remote agent terminal 108 may then send a session request 132 to the
 system interface 110, or alternatively, specifically to the speaker post
 112.

 C . Alternative System Embodiments

 [0056] FIG. 2 illustrates an alternate embodiment of the order processing
 system 100 in which the system interface 110 is configured to send a
 session request 142 to the order distributor 106 or to the selected
 remote agent terminal 108, rather than the selected remote agent terminal
 108 sending a session request 132. The session request 142, 132 is an
 attempt to establish a session between the customer at the speaker post
 112, 114 or store 146 and the selected remote agent terminal 108. During
 this session, there may be multiple connections established between the
 customer or remote POS location 104 and the selected remote agent
 terminal 108 for different purposes, such as a data connection for the
 transmission of an order and an audio connection allowing the customer to
 speak with the remote order taking agent 102. For example, an order data
 connection 134 may be established by the selected remote agent terminal
 108 to transmit the order to the store or RPOS system 120 through the
 system interface 110. The audio connection may be substantially
 simultaneously established through a standard phone line or a VoIP
 connection. The customer talks into the speaker post 112, 114 through the
 audio connection with the selected remote order taking agent 102 for
 communicating the commodities or order components the customer would like
 to order to the remote order taking agent 102 who enters them into the
 remote agent terminal 108. Where the audio connection is a VoIP
 connection, it may share the same session as the order data session 134.
 In other words, the audio data may be transmitted along with the order
 data.

 [0057] For example, the customer at a drive-through POS location 104 is
 connected through some form of an audio connection via the speaker post
 112, 114 with a selected remote order taking agent 102. The customer is
 prompted by the remote order taking agent 102 for their order and the
 customer then tells or otherwise provides the remote order taking agent
 102 what items/order components he/she would like to order, this being
 communicated to the remote order taking agent 102. As the remote order
 taking agent 102 hears the customer articulate each desired commodity,
 the remote order taking agent 102 inputs the ordered commodity or
 component into their remote agent terminal 108, such as via a virtually
 generated store-specific-POS-terminal-interface or normalized interface,
 as discussed above. The entry of an order component into the remote agent
 terminal 108, as it is entered by the remote order taking agent 102,
 causes the generation of order data identifying the ordered order
 component and the transmission of that order data to the store or system
 interface 110.

 [0058] Alternatively, two or more order components or commodities may be
 grouped together for transmission, such as where the order components are
 received and entered into the remote agent terminal 108 within a
 specified period of time, e.g. within 200 milliseconds of each other. It
 will be appreciated that the grouping of order components for
 transmission back to the store or system interface 110 is implementation
 dependent and that the decision to hold the transmission of one or more
 order components so that they can be grouped depends on balancing
 communication efficiency with the maintenance of at least the illusion of
 real time feed back to the customer and/or not inhibiting the order
 fulfillment process of the store, as described herein. In one embodiment,
 as the order data is received from the remote agent terminal 108, the
 order data may be provided to a display proximate to the speaker post
 112, 114 such that the customer may see a display of the items or
 components that the remote order taking agent 102 has already entered,
 the display being updated as the order components are entered. This
 operation is performed substantially in real-time, to give the customer
 the sense of an interactive experience, allow the customer to acknowledge
 the accuracy of the order, allow the customer to detect any errors as
 soon as possible and/or simply to prompt the customer to reflect on his
 decisions. The customer may then inform the remote order taking agent 102
 if there are any errors or if the customer would like to change any of
 the order components or items in the order. Alternatively, if there is no
 display screen for the customer, the remote order taking agent 102 may
 audibly repeat the order via the speaker post 112, 114 so the customer
 can acknowledge that it is correct. When the remote order taking agent
 102 finishes entering the order components and the customer has no more
 items to order, the remote order taking agent 102 may inform the customer
 of the total price, offer any discounts, upsells, cross-sells or
 otherwise announce any promotions or informational messages, and further
 may inform the customer where to go to pay and/or pick up the ordered
 items. The connection/session is then ended and the remote order taking
 agent 102 becomes available to take an order from another customer from
 the same or another store.

 [0059] The store&apos;s RPOS system 120, also is coupled with the system
 interface 110, as described above, and operative to receive customer or
 order information including receiving the order data, substantially as it
 is entered by the remote order taking agent 102 and transmitted to the
 system interface 110, for the purposes of fulfilling the order and
 otherwise integrating the order into the store&apos;s workflow, e.g. inventory
 management, etc. The RPOS system 120 may be located within the store at
 the POS location. In one embodiment, the store&apos;s RPOS system 120 is
 coupled with the communication network within a store and may include
 connections with the system interface 110. As discussed, the RPOS system
 120 may include the POS terminals, e.g. cash registers within a store and
 other order fulfillment stations, such as KVS&apos;s, as well as the POS
 server 90.

 [0060] In one embodiment, the RPOS system 120 may receive an order from the
 remote agent terminal 108 through an order connection 136 and the system
 interface 110, rather than an employee at the store entering the order
 into a POS terminal. The RPOS system 120 can transmit the order to at
 least one POS terminal 148, which an on-site employee then uses for
 fulfillment of the order and for collecting payment. In one embodiment,
 the store 146 may have POS terminals 148 as part of the RPOS system 120,
 some of which receive orders from a remote agent terminal 108, and
 others, which receive orders from on-site employees.

 [0061] For example, the POS terminal 148 in the RPOS system 120 may display
 the order components and the price for the items. An employee at the
 store 146 or the store register then makes/manufactures/prepares the
 order components or instructs them to be made, or otherwise gathers them
 into a complete order to be given to the customer. The employee then
 requests the payment from the customer based on the amount shown by the
 POS terminal 148. The POS terminal 148 may then further be used to
 receive payment, such as by credit card or cash. Once payment is received
 the order is fulfilled, and the POS terminal 148 can receive the next
 order.

 [0062] As described, in response to a customer arrival signal 124, 126
 indicating the presence of a customer waiting to place an order, the
 system interface 110 sends a customer arrival alert 128 to the order
 distributor 106 which then selects an appropriate remote agent terminal
 108 to initiate a session with the system interface 110 for the purposes
 of transmitting order data back to the system interface 110 and
 substantially simultaneously establishing an audio connection for the
 purpose of receiving the order from, or otherwise communicating with, the
 customer. While the mode of the audio connection may vary, the failure to
 establish such a connection is important to determine as soon as possible
 so as to enact fail over mechanisms as quickly as possible to handle the
 customer&apos;s order. In particular, in one embodiment, should a failure to
 establish the session, the audio connection, or both, occur, the system
 100 automatically detects the failure and enacts a fail over mechanism to
 handle the order. In this way, the customer&apos;s order, and the fulfillment
 thereof, is prioritized. Further, incomplete connections are avoided
 because an audio connection between the customer and the remote order
 taking agent 102 would not be established when the remote order taking
 agent 102 has no way to transmit the order back to the system interface
 110, as such a situation wastes the order taking agent&apos;s 102 time and
 promotes customer frustration. In failure situations, the system 100 may
 select an alternate remote agent 102 to handle the order or defer to the
 personnel at the store to take the order. In particular, where the system
 100 is able to determine that the problem is with the specific agent 102,
 another agent 102 would then be selected. However, where the problem is
 preventing connections with any remote order taking agents 102, then the
 system 100 directs the order to be handled at the store.

 [0063] The wired or wireless headsets 116, 118 are operative to establish
 an audio connection with a customer at the speaker posts 112, 114. In one
 embodiment, each headset is associated with a speaker post 112, 114 and
 permits the wearer to listen in and/or participate in any communications
 occurring with the speaker post 112, 114, such as an order being handled
 by a remote order taking agent 102. The headsets 116, 118 may connect
 with the system interface 110 through failover connections 138 and 140,
 respectively, described in more detail below. The system interface 110 is
 coupled with the speaker posts 112 and 114. The headsets 116, 118 have a
 microphone and speaker for communicating with the customer. The speaker
 may be an earpiece or headphones. In an alternate embodiment, the
 headsets 116, 118 may be wired within the store to establish a wired
 connection with the speaker post or with the system interface 110.

 [0064] If the connections 130, 132 or 134 between the remote order taking
 agent 102 or the order distributor 106 and the system interface 110 were
 to fail for any reason, then the system 100 must have a backup or
 fail-safe plan for receiving customer&apos;s orders, as was described. If
 either the audio or data connection fails, then the order may be received
 by employees within the store 146 via the headsets 116, 118. If the audio
 connection fails, then the customer and the remote order taking agent 102
 would be unable to communicate. If the data connection fails, then the
 remote order taking agent 102 would be unable to transmit the order data
 to the store 146. In either circumstance, the order taking responsibility
 reverts back to the store 146 and employees, with headsets 116, 118, who
 can then communicate with the system interface 110 through the failover
 connections 138, 140 which take over the communication, either
 automatically or via manual intervention. The headsets 116, 118 allow an
 employee to establish audio contact with the customer to receive the
 customer&apos;s order. The employee may then enter the order into the RPOS
 system 120, in one embodiment, picking up where the remote order taking
 agent 102 left off based on the order data transmitted thus far, as
 displayed on the POS terminal 148, before the failure or reenter the
 complete order. Similarly, if an alternate remote order taking agent 102
 is selected to take over the order, they may also be provided with the
 present status of the order so as to be able to pick up where the
 previous remote order taking agent 102 left off.

 [0065] For example, when the fail safe mode is activated, the order
 components that have already been transmitted by the remote order taking
 agent 102 are already entered into the RPOS system 120. For example, a
 customer at a drive-through says &quot;I would like to order two cheeseburgers
 and large fries.&quot; The selected order taker enters two (2) cheeseburgers
 and that data is transmitted to the store or interface, however, the data
 connection or audio connection then fails. The fail safe mode is
 activated with part of the order already entered, e.g., two cheeseburgers
 have already been recorded and received by the restaurant. An employee
 with a wireless headset 116 then establishes an audio connection with the
 customer in the drive-through, determines, from the POS terminal 148,
 what has been ordered thus far, and says &quot;I have 2 cheeseburgers for you,
 would you like anything else?&quot; The customer can then finish the order
 with the employee entering the remainder of the order into the POS
 terminal 148. In this way, the customer may never be aware that a failure
 occurred, maintaining customer satisfaction and confidence.

 [0066] In one embodiment, the remote order processing system 100 is part
 of/owned and operated by an overall order processing system of a
 restaurant or chain of restaurants. In an alternative embodiment, the
 remote order processing system 100 is provided as a service to one or
 more restaurants and/or restaurant chains. This service may be provided
 on a subscription or fixed fee basis, such as a monthly or yearly fee,
 basis, on a per-order/transaction basis, on a time basis, such as per
 minute or per second charge measured over the total time of the
 transaction or multiple transactions over a defined period, or
 combinations thereof. The time basis may be established to reflect the
 duration of the call or transaction such that longer, and presumably more
 complicated a transactions, are charged at a higher rate than shorter,
 simpler transactions. In one example, a restaurant or restaurant chain
 may contract with such a service to handle all orders or a fixed number
 of orders over a set period, such as one (1) year, such as to supplement
 an existing order taking mechanism. Alternatively, a restaurant or
 restaurant chain may contract with the service to handle overflow orders,
 such as those order which exceed the restaurant&apos;s or chain&apos;s own order
 taking capacity, e.g. lunch or dinner rush or during staffing shortages,
 weekends, holidays, etc. In an alternative embodiment, the fees charged
 may be fixed, or variable, such as based on, time of day, day of week,
 volume of orders or based on the value of the orders handled, e.g. based
 on gross or net margin, thereby incentivising the service to sell more
 products and/or more profitable products to customers. In one embodiment
 where a fee is charged per second, or some other period, of the
 transaction time, the rate may diminish or go up as the transaction takes
 longer to encourage fast and efficient order taking, i.e. the first few
 seconds are more expensive then the later seconds of the transaction,
 etc. It will be appreciated that the above methods of compensation may be
 combined to create a pricing system which meets the mutual needs of the
 service provider and the customers. To implement the particular fee
 structure, software may be included in the system interface 110 and/or
 order distributor 106, or elsewhere within the system 100, such as in a
 separate device, which monitors and/or records the appropriate parameters
 for billing purposes. The acquired data may then be provided to the
 service provider, such as to a billing server which handles the
 billing/accounting functions. Mechanisms may further be provided to allow
 service subscribers to monitor account/billing activity for audit or
 other purposes.

 II . System Operation and Interface

 [0067] The remote order processing system 100 described above in Section I
 includes embodiments directed to taking, processing and fulfilling orders
 both from within the retail location or store 146 and remotely from a
 centralized call center or work at home location. The following
 section(s) describes exemplary tools and mechanisms such as, for example,
 the graphical user interface that may be utilized throughout the order
 taking process. Moreover, the following section(s) provides one or more
 exemplary scenarios in which these potential tools and mechanisms may be
 utilized to facilitate the order-taking and fulfillment process.

 [0068] A. Interface Setup

 [0069] FIG. 3 illustrates the operational steps or procedures that may be
 undertaken by the agent 102 prior to initiating an order taking session
 or shift with the store 146 or the order distributor 106. At block 300,
 the agent 102 can power-up or otherwise activate the remote order taking
 terminal 108. The power-up sequence could simply be engaging a power
 switch to provide electrical current to the components of a computer
 system. Alternatively, the power-up sequence could involve awakening the
 computer system from a Stand-by or Hibernating state. In these states
 some or all of the components of the computer system have been disabled
 or powered down in order to save power or otherwise reduce system
 activity.

 [0070] At block 302, the agent 102 authenticates or confirms their identity
 and/or permission to utilize remote order taking terminal 108 and the
 tools contained thereon. For example, the agent 102 can, when prompted by
 the operating system, the order taking software executing, for example,
 on the terminal 108, or another program operating in conjunction with the
 operating system, provide authentication information. The authentication
 information may, for example, be a username and a password, biometric
 information such as a finger print and/or other coded information
 provided by, for example, a magnetic or radio frequency identification
 (RFID) card. The authentication can be further utilized as a part of an
 activity log to determine who and when individuals or agents 102 are
 signed-on and utilizing the remote order processing system 100.

 [0071] At block 304, the operating system can confirm the validity of the
 authentication information and unlock the functionality of the remote
 order taking terminal 108. Alternatively, the operating system and the
 remote order taking terminal 108 may be active, and the authentication
 information may be communicated via, for example, the internet to the
 order distributor 106 and/or the order interface system 110. If the
 authentication information is confirmed and accepted by the order
 distributor 106 and/or the order interface system 110, the agent 102 may
 be allowed to interact with the remote order processing system 100 and
 components. If, however, the authentication information is invalid or
 cannot be confirmed, an error message may be generated and provided to
 the agent 102. The error message may request verification of the
 authentication information or may indicate that the system is
 unavailable. Repeated errors may lock the remote order taking terminal
 108 and may be used to inform a supervisor or the order distributor 106
 that a security violation may be in progress.

 [0072] At block 306, assuming that authentication is confirmed and
 accepted, the agent 102 may access the terminal 108 and the remote order
 processing system 100. The confirmed authentication allows the agent 102
 to engage in idle state activities. The idle state occurs when the agent
 102 is not actively taking orders via the order system interface 110 and
 POS location 104, or when remote order center (&quot;ROC&quot;) or remote order
 system (&quot;ROS&quot;) interface or &quot;ROS Workbench&quot; is active but the agent 102
 has not started their shift or indicated they are available for order
 taking. Alternatively, the agent 102 may undergo additional training or
 instruction while the terminal 108 is maintained in the idle state.

 [0073] At block 308, the agent 102 can indicate their availability to
 receive orders to the order system interface 110 and the order
 distributor 106. Conversely, if the agent 102 is actively taking orders,
 the order distributor 106 can be instructed to halt further calls to the
 agent 102 after the termination of the current, active call or order.
 Thus, if the agent 102 is due for a break, the order distributor 106 can
 be instructed to switch the terminal 108 to the idle state once the
 current order is completed thereby preemptively blocking further calls.

 [0074] At block 310, the order distributor 106 and/or the store database
 122 can provide updated static data to the terminal 108, as generally
 described in Section I-B. The static data may include commodity listings
 such as: (i) new menus; (ii) new menu icons and images; (iii) updated
 pricing guides; (iv) updated promotion information; (v) new or offered
 services, or (vi) or any other business rule or software related updates
 or information. It will be understood that static information update may
 be accomplished virtually any time after the agent 102 is authenticated
 and in communication with the order distributor 106 and/or the store
 database 122 via the remote order taking terminal 108. Thus, in this
 embodiment, the store database 122 can include a baseline commodity
 listing that is representative of all of the commodities, menu items,
 products and services that are typically offered by the store 146 or
 retail location. In addition, if the store 146 or retail location
 includes or provides specialized or unique commodities or items, the
 store database 122 can includes this information as well.

 [0075] At block 312, the remote order system interface 110 can route the
 customer order request or arrival alert 128 to the order distributor 106.
 The order distributor 106 can, in turn, generate the initiate order
 command 130 and connect the remote order taking terminal 108 to the
 customer via the speaker post 112. In this way, the agent 102 can begin
 communicating directly with the customer to conduct an order taking
 session, as was described above. To facilitate this order taking process,
 the agent 102 is presented with a unified or otherwise normalized
 graphical user interface (GUI) 400 (see FIG. 4) configured to streamline
 the order taking process. As discussed above, the unified or normalized
 display typically provides the agent 102 with all of the information or
 baseline commodity listings related to the store 146 or related group of
 stores 146. In addition, the specialized or variable commodities offered
 by the store 146 from which the arrival alert 128 originated can be
 integrated into the normalized display. The normalized display will
 typically be configured in a standard layout or arrangement to promote
 agent familiarity, e.g., to be user friendly, and will include the
 variations or variable commodities as a part of the standard layout. The
 integration may include removing the focus of one or more graphical icons
 displayed by the normalized display, graying-out the icon (see FIGS. 4A
 and 4B), including new commodities on a specialized tab, or combinations
 thereof, as will be discussed in more detail below.

 [0076] At block 314, the RPOS system 120 located within the store 146, or
 communicatively connected with multiple related stores, can query the
 store database 122 to determine if the store information is up-to-date.
 For example, the store information can be periodically uploaded from the
 RPOS system 120 to the store database 122 for regular distribution as
 part of the static data communication.

 [0077] However, at block 316, if changes have been made at the RPOS system
 120 that are not reflected within the information resident on the store
 database 120, the order distributor 106, system interface 110 or other
 appropriately configured device can distribute or communicate these
 changes to the remote order taking terminal 108 as part of the dynamic
 data communication. In other words, updated or synchronized data can be
 provided to the agent 102 prior to the initiation of order taking or
 processing session with a customer.

 [0078] At a block 318, or at any other desirable time within the order
 taking process, the agent 102 may access a help or chat system. For
 example, during the idle state at block 306 or after an order has been
 complete for a customer, the agent 102 can access a chat or instant
 messaging feature to contact an ROS supervisor (not shown). A chat window
 can be generated that provides a textual interface between the agent 102
 and their ROS supervisor. The chat window can be configured to operate in
 the background of the order processing system 100 to allow the agent 102
 to continue to service and communicate with customers until the ROS
 supervisor responds to their query. In this way, help can be requested
 and provided without diminishing the efficiency or ability of the agent
 102 to continue servicing customers. In one example, requests made to the
 ROS supervisor can be routed directly to the supervisor&apos;s email address,
 instant messaging address and/or to their wireless device, if they are
 currently unavailable and the supervisor&apos;s availability status can be
 conveyed or returned to the agent 102.

 [0079] The help system or interface can further be utilized to convey
 sudden or urgent product or store changes during an ongoing order
 processing session, by providing information to the agent 102 via a
 pop-up screen or interface or other type of display designed to catch the
 attention of the agent 102. These product or store changes could include
 sudden product promotions, product outages, equipment failures such as an
 indication that the grill or fryer is unavailable, or any other
 information that could impact the customer&apos;s order. To prevent
 unnecessarily confusing or distracting the agent 102 during an order
 taking session, these sudden updates can be prioritized and delivered to
 the agent 102 during the session, after completion of the session or as a
 part of the scheduled dynamic data update prior to the initiation of the
 next session. Failure to complete these urgent updates, depending on the
 priority assigned thereto, could result in customer calls being re-queued
 or re-distributed by the order distributor 110 to an agent 102 in
 possession of the urgent information, or reverted back the store 146 to
 be handled.

 [0080] At a block 320, the updated and connected remote order taking
 terminal 108 can prompt the agent 102 to begin the order taking process.

 [0081] B. Order Taking

 [0082] FIG. 4 illustrates one embodiment of the unified or normalized GUI
 400 configured to display a baseline commodity listing such as, for
 example, menu items, promotional information such as cross selling
 opportunities and special menu items, nutritional information, etc. The
 commodities or information displayed via the GUI 400 can be organized and
 arranged to reflect retail items provided by any one of a plurality of
 stores 146. This organized and arranged information assists the agent 102
 in providing detailed and accurate service to the customer during an
 order taking session. It will be understood that the aesthetic design of
 the GUI 400 is implementation dependent and all arrangements and
 presentations of graphics or text based interface elements which achieves
 the disclosed functionality are contemplated.

 [0083] The exemplary GUI 400 is configured for use during an order
 processing session. The GUI 400 includes: (i) a numeric keypad 402; (ii)
 a current order window 404; (iii) an action or pending item window 406;
 (iv) a data window 408; (v) an options bar 410; (vi) a menu section 412;
 and (vii) a secondary menu section 414. The sections of the graphical
 user interface can be displayed on the cathode ray tube (CRT) or LCD
 monitor connected to the order taking terminal 108 at a size and
 resolution such as, for example, 1152×864, determined to easily
 display the required order information and options. Moreover, the GUI 400
 and the included sections can be configured to mirror the POS terminal
 interface used within the store 146. Alternate system configurations
 could employ a touch screen coupled to the LCD monitor thereby allowing
 the agent 102 to physically interact with the GUI 400 in a manner similar
 to an order taker physically located within the store 146. In yet another
 alternate configuration, the GUI 400 may cooperate with and/or be
 controlled by shortcuts and keystrokes provided via a keyboard (not
 shown) attached to the remote agent terminal 108. For example, the order
 taking agent 102 may select the control (CTRL) key to view additional
 information such as pricing, nutritional facts, etc., associated with
 identified products. It will be understood that other keystrokes and
 keystroke combinations may be predefined or customized to facilitate
 access to the functionality represented by the GUI 400.

 [0084] The GUI 400, as discussed herein, is displayed on a two-dimensional
 monitor which is, in turn, connected to the order taking terminal 108.
 Directions such as top, bottom, left and right, as used herein, are
 intended to refer to upper, lower, left and right portions of the GUI 400
 as it is displayed to the agent 102. While these size, location and
 arrangement of items and section comprising the GUI 400 are consistent
 throughout these descriptions, these elements are presented as merely one
 example of a user interface that could be constructed to perform these
 order taking functions. It will be understood that different
 configurations and arrangements of the GUI 400 could be devised while
 maintaining and reflecting the teaching and disclosure presented herein.
 Further, it will be appreciated that the aesthetic aspects of the GUI
 400, such as the pictures utilized, fonts or the colors, etc. are
 implementation dependent, such as the use of a corporate color scheme or
 the use of trademarked product names as icon representations of those
 products.

 [0085] The numeric keypad 402 is vertically arranged along the left hand
 side of the GUI 400. The numeric keypad 402 includes buttons or icons
 representing the numeral zero to nine, generally indicated by the numeral
 buttons 416. These buttons allow the agent 102 to select or identify the
 number of items, meals, promotional codes, prices, etc. during the course
 of the order taking process. The numeric keypad 402 further includes: a
 split button 418 and a break meal button 420. The split button 418 allows
 the agent 102 to separate multiple quantified products such as, for
 example, three (3) cheeseburgers, into one or more rows to allow the them
 to be grilled, e.g., to allow the properties and attributes of the
 cheeseburgers, or adjusted independently. The break meal button 420
 separates the individual items of the meal, e.g., the hamburger, fries
 and drink, into individual components with separate pricing. In other
 words, the discounted meal which typically includes a pre-selected
 sandwich, fries and size of drink can be broken down into individual
 items if the customer decides they no longer want the meal or would like
 to make specific modification thereto.

 [0086] The current order window 404, the pending item window 406 and the
 data window 408 occupy the top third of the GUI 400. The current order
 window 404 is the leftmost window, the pending item window 404 is the
 center or central window and the data window 408 is the right most
 window. During an order taking session, when the agent 102 is viewing the
 LCD monitor connected to the remote order taking terminal 108, the
 current order window 404, the pending item window 406 and the data window
 408 are arranged at eye-level for easy viewing. This elevated or
 eye-level position arranges the important, and ever-changing, call and
 order-specific information presented within the windows 404 to 408 in a
 prominent location for use by the agent 102.

 [0087] The current order window 404 is configured to provide a list of the
 ordered items, the meals, the drinks and the accessories such as
 promotional toys, newspapers or other items, requested by the customer
 and entered by the agent 102. These items can be arranged in an outline
 format wherein a meal heading or identifier occupies a first level and
 the individual component identifiers that comprise the meal are grouped
 under the meal identifier at a second level. Moreover, these items can be
 color coded, utilize different fonts, accents, highlights, indicators, or
 combinations thereof, to indicate their status, whether or not additional
 information is required, e.g., the size of an item, whether special
 handling is required or any other designated characteristic of the order
 or item. The current order window further includes a running subtotal
 with tax information, surcharges, processing fees, etc. It will be
 understood that the tax information could be provided to the remote order
 terminal 108 via either the static or dynamic data communications in
 order to reflect the current local taxes imposed at each of the store 146
 locations for which the agent 102 is in communication with during a
 shift.

 [0088] The pending item window 406 is configured to display detailed
 information related to an item currently being ordered or discussed
 between the customer and the agent 102. For example, if the customer, via
 the post 112 and the remote order system interface 110, requests a
 chicken sandwich, the item is listed in the current order windows 404 and
 the outstanding or unanswered questions related to that item are
 displayed in the pending items window. For this example, the chicken
 sandwich could come in a grilled or fried style, and the agent 102 is
 prompted via an information request displayed in the pending item window
 406 or a pop-up window to query the customer. Thus, the GUI 400 is
 configured or programmed to ensure that all of the information needed to
 complete a customer&apos;s order is gather before the completion of the order
 taking session. Moreover, products within an order may be grouped,
 reordered or displayed based on the type and status of the individual
 products, their association with a meal, the item size or any other
 quantifiable criteria. Alternatively, the pending item window 406 can be
 utilized to implement or display business rules such as drink logic.
 Thus, if a customer orders a meal, a message can be displayed in the
 pending item window 406 instructing the agent 102 to enquire about, for
 example, the type and size of the drink, the size of the fries, etc.

 [0089] Moreover, if the customer requests special handling or grilling of
 an ordered item, the agent 102 can highlight and select the item in the
 current order window 404 and the option bar 410 will reconfigure for that
 item. In particular, if a double cheeseburger is selected for special
 handling, a product build portion 422 of the option bar 410 displays the
 elements for that item. For example, a double cheeseburger could include:
 a sesame seed bun, first and second meat patties, ketchup, mustard,
 onions, and pickle. These components can be listed in any order, but will
 often be listed based on the frequency at which they are modified. In
 other words, the more often customer request &quot;no pickles&quot; the more
 convenient its location will be within the list.

 [0090] The option bar 410 can further include a grill options portion 424.
 The grill options portion 424 can include a list, or an abbreviated list,
 of the frequently used or requested grilling options. The list could
 include things items or options like extra or no ketchup, extra onions,
 plain buns and cooking options for meat patties. Alternatively, the agent
 102 could select an &quot;other&quot; button 426 arranged within the grill options
 portion 424. Selection of the &quot;other&quot; button 426 by the agent 102 could
 cause a complete listing of all the available grill options to be
 displayed. If an incorrect option is selected or if the customer changes
 their order, the agent 102 can select a clear button 428 to remove the
 options associated with the highlighted item displayed in the current
 order window 404.

 [0091] The pending item window 406 can be further configured to
 automatically implement promotions or display scripted business rules
 established by the store 146, the corporation or any other authorized
 entity. For example, if a two-for-three dollars business rule or
 promotion is established for bacon burgers and customer orders two bacon
 burgers, the pending item window 406 can remind the agent 102 to inform
 the customer of the special. Alternatively, the business rule or
 promotion can be automatically applied when two bacon burgers have been
 ordered and are listed in the current order window 402. Thus, even if a
 customer is unaware of a promotion, the business rule may be configured
 to provide them the benefit, and prompt the agent 102 to inform them of
 the received benefit. It will be understood that if the quantity of bacon
 burgers is decreased, the business rule and discount may not apply and
 the customer will be required to pay full price for the items. Other
 business rules could remind or prompt the agent 102 to up-sell based on:
 products in current order; time at the restaurant; quantity of items
 ordered; duration of the call; the particular meal being served, e.g.,
 breakfast, lunch or both; length of the queue. Promotions may further be
 provided as business rules to automatically prompt the agent 102 and
 reduce the time necessary to search for applicable promotions when a
 customer requests information, redemption, etc.

 [0092] The data window 408 is configured to provide detail order handling
 information to the agent 102. The data window 408 lists information
 related to the store 146. The store information could include the store
 number, location, local time and/or time zone, current weather and
 temperature and an indication of payment acceptance. The local time/time
 zone information can be utilized to determine what products are available
 at a given store 146 location, for example breakfast may be available for
 a store in the Pacific Time Zone (GMT offset: -8:00) and unavailable at
 another store in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT offset: -5:00). The data
 window 408 can further include an order timer window 430 that activates
 when the call is initiated between the customer and the agent 102, and
 ends when the final order is submitted to the store 146. The order timer
 window 430 allows the agent 102 readily manage their performance and
 gauge whether additional up-selling or customer interaction is called for
 or if the call is running too long and should be wrapped up.
 Alternatively, as discussed above, the determination to up-sell may be
 established as a business rule and communicated to the agent 102 via the
 action item windows 406. The timer information can also be stored on the
 order distributor 106, the store database 122 and/or the terminal 108 and
 used for evaluation purposes.

 [0093] The data window 408 further includes: a promo button 432; a store
 order button 434; a go-live after button 436; a dial prior cashier button
 438; and an additional function button 440. These additional buttons and
 options provide nested access to other functionality and subsystems that
 are integrated into the order processing system 100. For example, if
 customer needs to cancel an order, the agent 102 can pick the additional
 function button 440 and select the cancel order command to remove the
 order form the processing queue. If a customer accidentally gets caught
 up in the ordering queue in the drive-through, instead of exiting the
 restaurant, etc., the agent 102 can pick the additional function button
 440 and select the skip car command to identify to the store 146 that the
 car/customer is not associated with a pending order. If a customer
 queried through the speaker post 112 is determined to have already placed
 an order through an alternate means, the agent 102 can select the store
 order button 434 to indicate that the customer&apos;s order is already pending
 thereby skipping to the next customer in the queue and/or terminating the
 current session. In another scenario, if an error occurs during an order,
 the agent 102 can pick the additional function button 440 and select the
 re-queue call command to direct the customer to another agent for
 completion and satisfaction of their order. In addition, a message can be
 played to the customer apologizing for the delay and/or error and
 assuring them that another agent will assist them momentarily.

 [0094] The promo button 432 allows the agent 102 to reduce the price of a
 product to zero to accommodate a customer order which is accompanied by a
 coupon for a free product. The promotion can be applied on all or parts
 of a product quantity (e.g., two (2) of the three (3) ordered
 cheeseburgers could be offered as a promotion while the third is charged
 to full price). The dial prior cashier button 438 allows the agent 102,
 during the call, to identify that they need to contact the restaurant 146
 directly to provide further clarification that is not provided for in the
 system. The information about the phone number to call is stored on the
 local agent workstation 108 and is dynamic based on the store 146 for
 which the agent 102 is taking the order.

 [0095] The menu section 412 and the secondary menu section 414 occupy the
 bottom two-thirds of the GUI 400. Both of the menu sections 412, 414
 include numerous tabs 442 that display a plurality of icons 444
 representative of menu items associated with each tab 442. In the example
 illustrated by GUI 400, the tab 442a represents the lunch menu and
 includes icons 444. During an order taking session, when the agent 102 is
 viewing the LCD monitor connected to the remote order taking terminal
 108, the menu sections 412, 414 are may be consistently positioned at the
 bottom portion of the screen for consistency and ease of use. This
 consistent position assures that the menu information and items necessary
 for every store 146 and every ordering session is in a familiar and
 easily accessible position for use by the agent 102.

 [0096] The tab 442a, in the present example, represents the lunch menu.
 Moreover, the tab 442a may be configured to default to an appropriate
 meal based on, for example, dynamic store data, the time of day or
 business rules. For example, if an order is received from a location
 where it is morning, the tab 442 corresponding to &quot;Breakfast&quot; may be
 defaulted as the active tab 442. In another example, the order may be
 received from a location where the time is in the afternoon; the lunch
 menu tab 442b may be set as the default and active tab during this order.
 The lunch menu includes various the icons 444 that represent menu items
 such as, for example, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, meals, French fries,
 etc. These icons 444 are arranged, positioned and otherwise located in a
 consistent manner within each of the tabs 442 regardless of the
 restaurant 146 the agent 102 is servicing during a given ordering
 session. As a result, whenever the agent 102 responds to the initiate
 order command 130 communicated by the order distributor 106, the GUI 400
 presents menu sections 412, 414 that are arranged in a familiar and
 highly usable manner. For example, because all of the icons 444, e.g.,
 the large meal icon 444a and the cheeseburger icon 444b, are always
 positioned at the same location on the lunch menu tab 442a, the agent 102
 can quickly locate and select these items when a customer places an
 order. In order to indicate variation or changed in the commodities
 offered by a given retail location or store 146, the icons 444 may
 further be modified to provide availability or other information, as
 shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B.

 [0097] FIG. 4A depicts a breakfast menu icon 444a that is &quot;grayed-out&quot; to
 indicate that the item is not available for purchase because, for
 example, a temporary outage or shortage identified in the store&apos;s 146
 dynamic data. The icon 444a further includes a clock graphic 446 that
 denotes that the item is unavailable because of the current time of day
 at the store 146. The icon 444a further includes a meal identifier 448
 that indicates that the item may be purchased as part of a predefined
 meal at presumably a discounted price, or including a bonus, prize or
 other promotion. In one embodiment, the meal identifier(s) 448 may be
 arranged in ascending order, this order may be maintain even if the
 corresponding product, e.g., a cheeseburger meal or chicken sandwich
 meal, varies from store 146 to store 146&apos;. Alternatively, the placement
 of the meal products e.g., a cheeseburger meal or chicken sandwich meal,
 may be maintained and the meal identifier(s) 448 may be reorganized (in
 numerical or non-numeric order).

 [0098] Similarly, FIG. 4B depicts another grayed-out breakfast menu icon
 444b that would appear on one of the tabs 442 in order to maintain layout
 and visual consistency of the tabs but is not available for purchase by
 the customer. The icon 444b further includes a cross graphic 450 that
 denotes that the item is unavailable for purchase at the particular store
 146 for which the agent 102 is currently processing orders. The icons
 444a and 444b may further be configured to include price, size and other
 modifier information which may, for example, be viewed or activated via
 predefined keystroke commands. In this way, icons 444 that are typically
 part of the baseline commodity listing stored on the store database 122
 and communicated to the agent terminal 108 are always displayed or
 provided in standard layout or arrangement; however the availability of
 these commodities or the icons 444 representative of these commodities
 can be modified as discussed above.

 [0099] Alternatively, if the icons 444a and 444b represent special or
 non-standard items, they may be automatically and dynamically displayed
 on a predefined tab 442. For example, the &quot;other&quot; tab may be designated
 to include all non-standard menu items or products associated with a
 given store 146 or chain of stores 146. In this way, the GUI 400 can be
 customized to display virtually any item or product.

 [0100] The tabs 442, which divide the menu sections 412, 414, can organize
 the menu sections based on a variety of criteria such as, for example,
 the time if day the menu item is typically consumed, e.g., breakfast or
 other; the type of menu item, e.g., food, drink, dessert, etc.; the
 nature of the item, e.g., condiments to be used in conjunction with a
 menu item, promotion toys or giveaways, newspapers, bottled water, etc.
 For example, the tab 442b may includes all of the salad and healthy
 choice options for the menu sections 412, 414. Thus, if a customer orders
 a salad, the agent 102 simply selects the tab 442b and all of the salad
 menu item options will be displayed in a single uniform location.
 Conversely, if a previously ordered salad item is selected in the current
 order window 404, the tab 442b can be activated and the option bar 410
 can display all of the salad components and the most requested grill or
 modifying options. Similarly, if the tab 442b or a salad item are
 selected, the tab 442 corresponding to the condiments selection within
 the secondary menu section 414 may be activated and brought to the
 foreground to allow for a salad dressing selection.

 [0101] C. GUI and Menu Normalization

 [0102] FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a normalization system or
 operation that may be utilized in conjunction with the Interface Setup
 and Order Taking procedures discussed in Sections II-A&amp;B. It will be
 understood that these normalization and configuration steps can be
 implemented independent of the system start-up procedure or can be
 implemented in conjunction with the normal operations of the order
 processing system 100 to reflect changes or updates to the menu
 selections provided by the store 146.

 [0103] In this exemplary embodiment, it will be assumed that the start-up
 steps discussed at the blocks 300 to 304 (See FIG. 3) have been
 implemented and the ROS terminal 108 is authenticated and on-line.

 [0104] At block 500, a system user (not shown), manager, programmer, etc.
 at the store 146 can compile and organize a particular commodity listing,
 a product list, product group or grouping, or a store menu. The commodity
 listing or store menu may include standard menu items such as, for
 example, hamburgers, French fries, chicken sandwiches, drinks, meals,
 etc. and non-standard menu items. Non-standard menu items or commodities
 could include any number of food or non-food merchandise sold or provided
 by the store 146. For example, the store 146 could decide to provide
 newspapers to morning commuters. Alternatively, the store 146 could
 provide regional menu items such as southern cuisine, southwestern
 cuisine, New England clam chowder, etc.

 [0105] The commodity listing or store menu can further include
 identification information related to both the standard menu items and
 the non-standard menu items. For example, if the store 146 decides to
 provide a tex-mex item, a customized illustration, icon or graphical
 representation of the item could be created. Alternatively, for a
 seasonal or non-permanent menu item, text-based icon or identifier could
 be established and provided.

 [0106] Pricing information and business rules can be defined and
 established by the system user to reflect the business environment in
 which each store 146 operates. For example, prices can be adjusted to
 reflect, among other things, the popularity of particular menu items,
 storages or surpluses of the menu item ingredients, or specials and
 promotions. Business rules can be defined in conjunction with pricing
 information to, for example, provide a discounted price if two or more of
 a particular menu item is ordered. Alternatively, a business rule could,
 for example, identify a product special on a given day of the week or
 related to a holiday, discounts to be given to senior citizens or AARP
 members, advise that police officers or other public servants are to be
 provided with free coffee or soda, and/or advise one the use or
 availability of coupons that may be in circulation. Other examples of
 business rules may include, as discussed above, promotions or specials
 such as, for example, special combo meals, two-for-one purchases,
 buy-one, get-one free offers, etc.

 [0107] All of this information, i.e., the store menu, the business rules
 and pricing information can be formatted by the system user at the store
 146 for upload and storage within the store database 122. For example,
 the remote order interface system 110 and/or the RPOS system 120 can
 include an information interface (not shown) configured to organize menu
 information for uploading or communication. The menu information could be
 provided in a variety of formats such as a text file, comma separated
 values (CSV) file, a hypertext markup language file (HTML) and/or an
 extensible markup language file (XML). If an XML file containing the menu
 information is to be provided to the store database 122, a document type
 definition file (DTD) or an XML schema should be defined to describe the
 data within the file. For example, the DTD file could identify a field as&lt;SANDWICH&gt;. . .&lt;/SANDWICH&gt;, and the information stored or
 associated with the field could be HAMBURGER. Additional information
 could be defined if the menu item is time of day-specific, e.g., it is a
 lunch or breakfast item, or is a seasonal or promotional item, etc. Thus,
 any program utilizing the DTD and/or the defined XML Schema would know
 that the information identified as a hamburger should be grouped or
 displayed as a sandwich. Further field and/or tags can be defined to
 describe and organize every item on the store menu and the grilling
 option or options by which they can be modified.

 [0108] At block 502, the compiled and formatted store menu or retail
 location-specific commodity listing can be uploaded or communicated via
 the remote order interface system 110 to the store database 122. This
 formatted commodity listing or store menu is, in turn, stored and
 associated with the store 146 or group of stores from which it
 originated. This store-specific commodity information can be periodically
 updated by the store 146, corporate headquarters, regional distributors,
 etc. to reflect current menu or baseline commodity selections, pricing
 structures or promotions. Moreover, the information can be monitored and
 compared to the information stored locally on the each remote order
 taking terminal 108. Changes, updates or modification to the commodity
 listing or menu information can be pushed down from the store database
 122 to terminal 108 during the static data communication described at
 block 310 (See FIG. 3).

 [0109] At block 504, the remote order processing system 100 is configured
 to process and accept orders from a customer via the drive-up speaker
 post 112, 114 or an internal RPOS terminal 120. As described at block
 312, the arrival of the customer at the speaker post 112, 114 alerts the
 remote order system interface 110 and the order distributor 106. The
 order distributor 106, in turn, identifies an available remote order
 taking terminal 108 and agent 102. Agent availability can be determined
 based on idle status, training, physical location relative to the store
 146, geographic indicia such as accent or regional dialect, and any of
 the other factors previously discussed.

 [0110] At block 506, as previously described at block 314, the retail
 location-specific or remote commodity information such as, the store
 information and/or the store menu (generally referred to as &quot;the local
 information&quot;), stored on the remote order system interface 110 and/or the
 RPOS system 120 can be compared to the baseline commodity listing stored
 on the store database 122 (generally referred to as &quot;the server
 information&quot;) and accessible through the order distributor 106. The
 differences between the remote commodity listing portion of the local
 information and baseline or store-specific commodity listing portion of
 the server information represent changes that can occur in the time frame
 between the regularly scheduled static data communication and the current
 order taking session. It will be understood that changes or alteration of
 other store or server information may be synchronized and communicated in
 the manner described herein. Alternatively, the RPOS system 120 can track
 the changes made to the local information since the last upload or update
 of the store database. In other words, changes can be identified between
 time-stamped versions of the local information without a direct
 comparison to the server information.

 [0111] At block 508, the tracked changes or differences between the
 versions of local information and/or the local information and the server
 information can be identified and categorized to determine if an updated
 is required. Exemplary local information could include store information
 such as a malfunctioning fryer which will impact the availability of
 fried food items such as French fries or chicken strips, or store menu
 information such as the addition of a new food item. Thus, these changes
 in local information could be the result of planning by a store manager
 or regional director, etc., or could be the result of some uncontrollable
 or outside event, i.e., a power outage or delivery mistake. If an order
 taking session has been initiated between a customer and the agent 102,
 the necessary updates can be provided at the outset of the session to
 ensure that the agent has the most reliable information and can thereby
 serve the customer better. Alternatively, if an order taking session has
 been initiated and the updates are deemed to large or time consuming to
 communicate to the agent 102, the order distributor 106 can redirect the
 session to another agent with more current information. In yet another
 alternative, if an order taking session has not been initiated, the
 changed or modified local information can be uploaded via the remote
 order system interface 110 and the order distributor 106 for storage in
 the store database 122. It will be understood that these updating and
 synchronization strategies are intended to be illustrative only of the
 capabilities of the system 100, and are not intended to be limiting in
 any manner.

 [0112] At block 510, assuming that an order taking session has been
 initiated, the identified changes or updates within the local information
 can be organized and/or formatted into a desirable form for communication
 to the remote order taking terminal 108. For example, changes in the
 business rules, menu items and options, etc. can be identified, organized
 into an appropriate format such as, for example, XML, HTML, .TXT file
 formats, for communication as dynamic data to the remote order taking
 terminal 108.

 [0113] At block 512, the changes can, simultaneously or in a batch format,
 be communicated to the store database 122 via the order distributor 106.
 It will be understood, that the size and complexity of these update filed
 can be varied and adapted to be compensated for increases and decreases
 in the communications bandwidth between the interface 110 and terminal
 108.

 [0114] At block 514, the identified, changed local information, including
 the retail location-specific or remote commodity information, can be
 provided or communicated to the remote order taking terminal 108 and the
 agent 102 as a dynamic data communication. As previously discussed, this
 information exchange/update can occur before and/or as communication is
 initiated between the agent 102 and the customer who initiated the order
 at the store 146. The updated or changed local commodity information can
 be integrated and/or assimilated into the GUI 400 to display the latest
 menu information related to the store 146. For example, the provided
 changed menu information could include a new menu item such as, for
 example, a new wrap sandwich. If the wrap sandwich is part of the
 standard menu configuration displayed in the menu section 412, this item
 could be highlighted, the pricing updated, the graphical icon changed, or
 any other characteristic could be altered. However, if the new menu item
 is a non-standard item, e.g., it is not normally offered by associated
 restaurants and therefore would not be part of the standard menu, the
 menu item information, icon, etc. could be placed in special tab 442. For
 example, the &quot;Other&quot; tab 442b may be designated within the GUI 400.

 [0115] With this arrangement, the GUI 400 can be configured to display a
 baseline commodity listing or standardized menu that includes all of the
 items typically or normally offered and provided by the store 146 or a
 large group of stores 146. The information within the GUI 400, as
 previously discussed, will typically be arranged in a consistent manner
 to allow the agent 102 to become familiar with the items, options and
 selections associated with the menu. The agent&apos;s familiarization with the
 organization and layout of the commodity listing or menu will provide for
 a speedy order taking process by reducing agent&apos;s need to search and hunt
 for ordered items and or features. When the changed or updated commodity
 information related to a specific retail location is received by the
 terminal 108, the overall look and feel of the GUI 400 will be maintained
 while the information is integrated and the display is normalized. For
 example, if the store 146 is on the west coast (i.e., in the Pacific Time
 Zone, GMT offset: -8:00) and the agent 102 is in the Midwest (i.e., the
 Central Time Zone, GMT offset: -6:00) the time differences may give rise
 to a situation where it is lunch time in the agent&apos;s time zone but
 breakfast time in the store&apos;s time zone. In this instance, the lunch tab
 442a would still be listed to ensure menu continuity, but the lunch tab
 442a could be made inaccessible, i.e., grayed out, or all of the items
 within the tab could be individually grayed out and a clock graphic 446
 could be appended thereto. In this way, the look and feel of the GUI 400
 is maintained while the menu selections are normalized or configured
 based on the needs and requirements of the individual store 146.

 [0116] Regardless of the changes or information provided to the terminal
 108, the GUI 400 maintains a constant, or essentially constant,
 configuration that is consistent and familiar to the agent. The update
 information received from the store database 122 or as part of a dynamic
 data update from the store 146 can be integrated into the GUI 400,
 thereby allowing the store menu information presented to the agent 102 to
 be normalized and customized for each store 146 while simultaneously
 preventing confusion that could arise if the display were to be
 constantly changed or reconfigured by each dynamic data update.

 [0117] D. Database Update and Synchronization

 [0118] FIG. 6 illustrates an embodiment of an updating process that may be
 implemented and utilized in conjunction with the Interface Setup
 procedure discussed in Sections II-A. It will be understood that these
 updating steps can be implemented independent of the system start-up
 procedure or can be implemented in conjunction with the normal operations
 of the order processing system 100 to reflect changes or updates to the
 menu selections provided by the store 146.

 [0119] At block 600, a system user (not shown), manager, programmer, etc.
 at the store 146 can compile and organize a particular commodity listing,
 a product list, product group or grouping, or a store menu. Non-standard
 menu items or commodities could include any number of food or non-food
 merchandise sold or provided by the store 146. The created commodity
 listing may, in turn, be assigned version information such as, for
 example, a time stamp or other identifier. The created commodity listing
 may be compared to the commodity listing stored on the order distributor
 106 and/or store database 122.

 [0120] At block 602, if the information or version of the commodity listing
 provided at the system interface 110 or store 146 is different than the
 information or commodity listing stored on the order distributor 106
 and/or store database 122, the store product database or commodity
 listing can be uploaded to the store database 122.

 [0121] At block 604, the individual menu items, product codes, business
 rules, contained within the uploaded commodity listing can be compared to
 the commodity listing stored or otherwise utilized on the order
 distributor 106 and/or store database 122. The comparison may include,
 for example, checks between the product codes and/or descriptions
 assigned to each item within the commodity listing. Alternatively, the
 comparison may include: pricing, promotions, quantity information and any
 other information that may be customized or altered at the store location
 146. If the two commodity listings contain the same information, i.e.,
 are the same version, an information upload may not be necessary and the
 operation may be discontinued or completed as indicated at block 610.

 [0122] At block 606, the compared products or items within the uploaded
 commodity listing that match existing products within stored database can
 be mapped, synchronized or otherwise reconciled with the information
 contained on the order distributor 106 and/or store database 122. If the
 compared products or items within the uploaded commodity listing do not
 match products within stored database, the new items may be flagged or
 indicated for additional attention. These flagged items or products may
 be manually reconciled or inputted, or they may be subjected to one or
 more recognition routines configured to identify, associate and/or
 categorize products based on known parameters and values.

 [0123] At block 608, the flagged values are integrated within the database
 122. Thus, the provided or new products, promotions or business rules are
 generated and entered within the database 122. These new products, etc.
 may, in turn, be available to other stores or location for utilization in
 commodity listings associated with other store locations 146.

 [0124] At block 610, the location and placement of button or icon
 information with the GUI 400 can be identified and associated with the
 new products and/or promotions. Upon completion of customization of the
 GUI 400, the update operation may be discontinued or completed. At this
 point, the information within the store database 122 and/or the order
 distributor 106 is synchronized and reconciled. The updated information
 may, in turn, be communicated to the order taking agent 102/terminal 108
 via the static and/or dynamic data.

 [0125] To clarify the use in the pending claims and to hereby provide
 notice to the public, the phrases &quot;at least one of&lt;A&gt;,&lt;B&gt;,
 . . . and&lt;N&gt;&quot; or &quot;at least one of&lt;A&gt;,&lt;B&gt;, . . .&lt;N&gt;, or combinations thereof&quot; are defined by the Applicant in the
 broadest sense, superseding any other implied definitions herebefore or
 hereinafter unless expressly asserted by the Applicant to the contrary,
 to mean one or more elements selected from the group comprising A, B, . .
 . and N, that is to say, any combination of one or more of the elements
 A, B, . . . or N including any one element alone or in combination with
 one or more of the other elements which may also include, in combination,
 additional elements not listed.

 [0126] Moreover, it should be understood that various changes and
 modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein
 will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and
 modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of
 the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It
 is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by
 the appended claims.
