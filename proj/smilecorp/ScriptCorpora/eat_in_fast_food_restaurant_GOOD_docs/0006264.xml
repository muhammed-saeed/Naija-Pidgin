Will kids love the new Happy Meal?
 
The McDonald&apos;s meal will feature both apple slices and fries, and customers would have to specifically ask for more fries in place of the apples.
 By doubleace Jul 26, 2011 2:55PM 
 This post comes from Lynn Mucken at MSN Money. 




Pummeled by healthy-food advocates -- but loved by little kids everywhere -- the iconic Happy Meal is undergoing another transformation.



Will it change the eating habits of America&apos;s ever-more-obese children ? Probably not.



Fast-food giant McDonald’s has announced it will offer a Happy Meal that could contain 20% fewer calories. According to a Chicago Tribune story, the switchover will begin in September and be completed at all 14,000 restaurants by April. Post continues after video. 
 
The lower-calorie Happy Meal -- still with a choice of hamburger, cheeseburger or Chicken McNuggets -- will offer both fries and fresh apples, but with the option of dropping one and upsizing the other.



The 2.4 ounces of potatoes in the current fries-only version will be replaced instead by 1.1 ounces of fries, plus the apples. According to McDonald&apos;s nutritional chart , the smaller fries portion would eliminate about 110 calories. It will replace the 3.1 ounces of Apple Dippers with caramel sauce (100 calories) that is in the apple-only version with 1.2 ounces of fresh apple slices ( about 20 calories ) in the new Happy Meal.



McDonald&apos;s said the apples could be replaced by pineapple, mandarin oranges, raisins or even carrots, depending on the time of year or region.



The reduction in fries in the Happy Meal is a good idea. A recently released 20-year Harvard University study showed that fries were the No. 1 cause of weight gain among participating adults. Wrote The New York Times :

The foods that contributed to the greatest weight gain were not surprising. French fries led the list: Increased consumption of this food alone was linked to an average weight gain of 3.4 pounds in each four-year period. Other important contributors were potato chips (1.7 pounds), sugar-sweetened drinks (1 pound), red meats and processed meats (0.95 and 0.93 pound, respectively), other forms of potatoes (0.57 pound), sweets and desserts (0.41 pound), refined grains (0.39 pound), other fried foods (0.32 pound), 100-percent fruit juice (0.31 pound) and butter (0.3 pound).


Good intentions aside, the Happy Meal is all about choice.




The Happy Meal remodeling began in 2004, and included making 1% milk and low-fat chocolate milk available as substitutes for soda, going to white meat instead of dark on the McNuggets and adding the apples as a choice. In addition, McDonald&apos;s stopped mentioning hamburgers and fries in its Happy Meal advertising in 2006, and promoted the apple option heavily. Still, the apple-only option was only 11% of Happy Meal sales.




According to a story on NPR&apos;s health blog, the effort to promote less consumption of fries is another step forward. &quot;We know very clearly from consumer research that consumers react better to positives rather than negatives,&quot; said Eileen Kennedy of the Freidman School of Nutrition and Policy at Tufts University.




&quot;We really need the industry to stand shoulder to shoulder on this one,&quot; she said.




McDonald&apos;s said it even did testing that eliminated fries altogether in the Happy Meal, subbing in the apples, but no one was buying.




&quot;People come to McDonald&apos;s and, first of all, they want the choice and the control to be theirs, but their expectation of a Happy Meal does include a fry,&quot; Jan Fields, president of McDonald&apos;s USA, told the Chicago Tribune. &quot;When we did it without fries, there was a huge disappointment factor.&quot;



That&apos;s no surprise: Kids want their fries, said Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a restaurant industry consulting company.




&quot;I think you&apos;re going to get a good reaction from kids who like apples,&quot; he told the Tribune. &quot;But ultimately I think we&apos;re going to see a good bit of apples wasted from kids who just refuse to eat them.&quot;



And that means we&apos;re still going to see kids order the &quot;Tummy-yummy cheeseburger with a choice of soft drink and small World Famous Fries&quot; version of the Happy Meal. That&apos;s a quick 640 calories.

 Graham Byrne Nov 3, 2011 9:48PM Good God people, I just got my first ripoff happy meal tonight. I ended up splitting my own fries with my kids. It&apos;s junk food night, if I wanted to have them eat healthy food, I wouldn&apos;t have gone to McDonalds in the first place. I&apos;m not letting the bastards away with this, that Haloween candy that I hid is now coming out front and center.

I mentioned the toy and the clown for 2 reasons: 1) They use these things to market to children and it works. But, it is ultimately the parents responsibility to choose whether or not to yield to the child and purchase the food. 2) I said that my children chose McDonald&apos;s because of the TOY not the food. Basically they couldn&apos;t care less about the food. It is a nanny state when the powers that be feel that they need to legislate what I choose to eat. It&apos;s NONE of their BUSINESS!!!! This isn&apos;t a communist country last I looked. We have and always have been capitalists and that&apos;s fine with me. I&apos;m an intelligent person and I can decide, without government intervention, what goes in my mouth. Now that my kids are older they still only eat fast food on paydays, every other Friday. My oldest and his wife are very good cooks and cook as a family with their 2 kids. My youngest and his wife are both chefs and wouldn&apos;t be caught dead in a fast food joint. So, what did I teach them? MODERATION!! Oh, and they all belong to health clubs, the YMCA and use it almost daily, as a family. No one is obese or overweight, no one sits in front of the TV hours on end. That is actually the problem, inactivity. The more we got away from a nation that had physically demanding jobs and moved to an information, tech society the fatter the nation has become. Yes, I did mention common sense, and I still mean it. Use your common sense whether your purchasing your meals from fast food places or the Supermarket a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. Consume to many and don&apos;t exercise and you get fat, period. It&apos;s not the fast food restaurants fault, it&apos;s up the individual to take control. Like you said to someone else on here; &quot;Open forum...I can have my own opinion&quot; Same here.

Rachel - You essentially get two very small side orders with the meal.

You can either have:

2 apple portions, or 1 apple, 1 fries, or 2 fry portions.

The McD apples are not special. You can easily make them at home.

We frequently get a fast food main dish with no sides, then eat with our own homemade salad. (I prefer apples/orange slices on top of my salad).

Saves money, just as quick and is healthier. (We frequently store salad in tupperware type container in fridge so it&apos;s always ready to go - no tomatoes or dressings as they make it get soggy).

We recently switched from just lettuces to spinach lettuce blend. Tastes great, but there are many more nutrients in spinach.

And we know the fries are a treat - not the healthiest, but eating is one of life&apos;s true pleasures. I&apos;d rather have to work off the calories than give up all the tasty stuff. (weight watchers has a good system of trading calories for exercise).

 The article states that with specific request, you can trade in the small portion of apples to get a traditional size of fries. Will I be able to trade in the small portion of fries for a traditional portion of apples? My children don&apos;t eat fries.... does that mean they will have to eat fewer fruits too?

Also, my one daughter ONLY eats apples. It&apos;s one of the reasons we actually cave for McD&apos;s a lot when we do go out to eat...because we know we get apples instead of oranges... and as far as the orange and pineapple option...two of my four kids react to citrus fruits (which is actually quite common).

Some city Gov&apos;ts are banning toys in Happy Meals. Others are blocking permits for new McDonalds. Federal regulations are controlling how their menu&apos;s are displayed. Special taxes are being threatened. Ingredients are banned by Gov&apos;t (ie. trans fat).

Gov&apos;t is regulating and threatening to regulate our restaurants. As if they don&apos;t have enough control already.

So clearly Gov&apos;t is playing a role in forcing Fast Food Companies to go against the wishes of their customers.

Let&apos;s face it, some people are babies that need a nanny state. Those people should not be allowed to vote. If you can&apos;t feed yourself, even though you are able bodied, you have no business in selecting our leaders.

If you have a personal problem, it&apos;s just that: your personal problem. It&apos;s not my responsibility. If you are afraid of freedom of choice - taking choices away doesn&apos;t solve the problem. It just props up people who are too weak to stand, instead of letting them learn from the consequences of their actions.

Out of all the comments here, mine is the only one that mentions the truth about food. It is not only about McDonalds...it is the food you buy at the grocery store. Hello everyone wake up and smell the genetically modified foods you are ingesting on a daily basis. The chemicals, the preservatives, the hormones. It leads to disorders, heart conditions, cancer! You all complain about the governments involvement...well DUH!!! Big Brother has to know and control all that is around him! It does nothing to complain when you don&apos;t back it up with action. We are a Nation of Idiots. The United States of Illegal Aliens who can&apos;t speak the language, and take jobs away from real Americans! The problem is so much more than McDonalds.

I hope you get the irony that your own self induced medical problems did in fact add to the problem of healthcare or the lack thereof in this country. I hope all these people complaining about seat-belt laws and the Nanny State and McD&apos;s putting apples in the Happy Meal, realize that if they took personal responsibility to it&apos;s logical and most extreme conclusion, you should have been forced to self medicate, the woman with the autistic child should be forced to deal with the problem without state help, (and with an autistic child she can&apos;t claim to have not benefited from gov&apos;t support) and Texas should just secede... I&apos;m all for that.

 Number 1 cause of death in America is currently heart disease. Major contributing factors? High cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity...to name a few.  America has lost all sense of moderation and self control. This little McDonald&apos;s move is a step in the right direction.

 Previous replies Write a reply... joonbugh Jul 27, 2011 2:52PM There&apos;s nothing in the article about any specifically governmental influence. Yes, unnamed nutritional experts were &quot;putting pressure&quot; on McDonald&apos;s, but really it seems like it&apos;s just a decision made by the company as something of a marketing strategy. Yes, you have a right to eat wherever you want, and it seems that McDonald&apos;s is catering somewhat to the parents who don&apos;t want their kids to eat at their restaurants because of a lack of healthier choices. Mrs. Obama&apos;s praise of the measure doesn&apos;t constitute government interference. Our government is *far* from perfect, but I&apos;m sorry, it bothers me when people complain about interference when no evidence of interference is cited.

 Previous replies Write a reply... IReadTheArticle Jul 27, 2011 2:52PM First of all to all those who keep saying the government forced McDonald&apos;s to do this and Michele Obama forced McDonald&apos;s to do that, get a damn clue and learn to comprehend what you read, something that would happen with better nutrition. The article states that McD&apos;s was responding to advocacy groups, organizations with names like Mom&apos;s for Healthy Eating or some such. No gov&apos;t entity or First Lady can actually force a private enterprise to do anything. Our system just doesn&apos;t work like that.

For all of you idiots complaining about seatbelt laws and helmet laws, do a little research and find out how many children&apos;s lives were saved, since we all like to get up in bloody arms over our spoiled, over-weight, under achieving little darlings. Also, understand how long it took those laws to be enacted, how much advocacy and lobbying and letter writing and mother&apos;s of dead children appearing before congress it took to get seat-belt laws passed, just like no smoking in public places, etc.

McD&apos;s is simply trying to be responsible in the face of epidemic obesity in America - since they helped add to the problem it&apos;s the least they can do. It&apos;s a gesture. A symbol. Maybe an apple in a Happy Meal might help to push those apples in school vending machines that go bad because kids stock up on their way to school at the local 7/11 or Circle K. (Who really needs a Super Big Gulp at 8am).

Anyway, get a grip you libertarian paranoids. Maybe if all those red states weren&apos;t coincidentally the fattest states, you&apos;d realize that on occasion, since we can&apos;t seem to discipline ourselves, the gov&apos;t and advocacy groups need to step in and call BS.

600 friggin&apos; calories from 1 friggin&apos; meal!

And like one poster said, I&apos;m of an age where McD&apos;s was a treat, not a mainstay. You got to gorge yourself on Happy Meals and double fries because you brought straight A&apos;s home.

I feel for our kids because they don&apos;t know a world where when you got home from school you hurried up to do your homework so you could go outside and play with your friends, run around and get dirty and scrape your knees and come home in time for a dinner someone cooked.

I ate potato chips, big macs, loved cookies, and ate the icing my aunt would put on home cooked cup cakes. But I was never obese. As most of you agree, it&apos;s because when we were kids, we had mothers, aunts, fathers, someone telling us to turn off the tv and go outside and play.

Of course that was before serial killers and pedophiles dominated the news scaring us all half to death.

Despite the fact that govt. is interfering too much in our lives, it is also a proven fact that fast food makes you fat and unhealthy. My parents didn&apos;t know any better and I grew up eating whatever I wanted, which was burgers, fries, and Cokes. About 5 years ago at age 42, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - very advanced (no healthcare, couldn&apos;t and still can&apos;t afford it). This all came from obesity (I used to weigh 320 lbs.) which came from those same poor eating habits. I was addicted to cheap, nutritionless food.

Now I have lost one eye&apos;s sight to retinopathy, have severe kidney dysfunction, and a host of other related medical issues, all derived from a life of eating that cheap fast food. While I&apos;m not dead yet, I have completely changed my life and focused on proper nutrition for me and my family. No more red meat, lots of veggies and Mediterranean diet, and particularly, NO MORE FAST FOOD!

Unless you want what happened to me to happen to you, your kids, or anyone, then don&apos;t buy those Happy Meals! They are culinary poison! McDonalds is not out to make you healthy - they are there solely to make money, and work hand in hand with big pharma to keep you fat, sick and spending money just to stay alive long enough to purchase another fat and cholesterol bomb. They do not care about anything but your cash, so don&apos;t buy into their advertising.

Now I weigh 230 lbs and continue to lose weight. I do moderate exercise, nothing extreme, take my meds and my vitamins religiously, and am looking forward to the day I am off the meds completely. I am in control of my life and my health, and haven&apos;t had a burger in years. I did it - you and your kids can do it too. A little denial and sacrifice in your life is a good thing.

JUST SAY NO!

To the Gov&apos;t apologists who need that nanny state so they can remain babies:

100 years ago there was NO GOV&apos;T INTRUSION into diet, and people were thin.

(Our Gov&apos;t actually has created an obesity problem for the &quot;poor&quot; here. Yes, for the first time in human history, the &quot;poor&quot; face obesity as their number one problem.)

We have never had more Gov&apos;t intrusion into our lives than now, but look at the results. We tried the Big Nanny State Gov&apos;t Experiment - it failed. Time to go back to the only model that has proven successful: personal responsibility and consequences for your own actions.

 Previous replies Write a reply... goodtvisrare Jul 27, 2011 2:37PM A happy meal is a treat when you/re out and about with the kids. The kids enjoy the meal and more so, enjoy the toy that goes with it. I get tired of everybody blaming McDonalds and everyone else for their obese kids. The PARENTS need to monitor what their children eat. They need to be especially careful if their kids are overweight. It&apos;s not politically correct to say-but check out the whole family at the fast food restaurant, the fair, whatever--usually mom. dad. the kids--the whole family is overweight and they&apos;re two- **** it with food in both hands-- then they wonder why no one is losing weight.

Glockguy Jul 27, 2011 2:34PM This is absolutely ridiculous the government needs to get out of everyone&apos;s life stop treating everybody like the two-year-olds seatbelt laws, helmet laws and now food laws. It&apos;s my choice what my children eat and what I eat not the governments if I want to eat at McDonald&apos;s seven days a week that&apos;s my choice I don&apos;t go to McDonald&apos;s to eat apples or carrots I go there to eat hamburgers and french fries and milkshakes. The healthcare argument doesn&apos;t work as long as you continue to have smoking alcohol both cause far more health related issues the McDonald&apos;s causes.

 Previous replies Write a reply... tlb100270 Jul 27, 2011 2:32PM I agree with the lack of physical activity too. If someone is going to dictate what foods we eat when we go out, why not ban video games,,,and tv all together. I too spent my childhood outside playing games with the neighborhood kids.. I was pretty active. I just don&apos;t see that anymore. Technology is helping to make society lazy and parents are giving into their children in order to keep up with the kids down the street... lets make everything electric so kids no longer have to peddle a bike or work at getting a skate board to move...just push a button and no need for physical activity required. That being said, all this falls on the parents. It&apos;s too common these days for parents to wait for someone in the government or school system to do what they, as parents, should be doing. Schools have a limited budget.. parents are the first ones to want taxes to increase to give to schools so their kids have a healthier meal...well, here&apos;s an idea.. pack a lunch for them.  Stop putting your burdens on the rest of us who do take care of our own. I don&apos;t want to help raise YOUR child. I don&apos;t want to pay more to raise YOUR child. Donate your own money to the schools to have better lunches.. hmm.. there&apos;s an idea too.

McDonald&apos;s and fast food in general should be a treat....that means once in a while....not everyday or even every few days. I take my kids to McDonald&apos;s once in a while because it&apos;s fun and they like a treat sometimes. I get their Happy Meals with milk and apples - I don&apos;t give them a choice to get fries or soda. They love it.

 

Take responsibility people...make your kids go out and play, stop feeding them garbage food all the time, set an example for them by EATING HEALTHY YOURSELF and stop blaming everyone else for your problems!!
