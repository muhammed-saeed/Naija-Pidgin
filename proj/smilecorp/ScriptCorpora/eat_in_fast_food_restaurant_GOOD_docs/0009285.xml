 Image Facts Incorrect 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mcdonalds_World_locations_map.PNG Specifically Estonia, indicated on that map got its first McDonalds in the very early 90s. I was living there at the time. Initially a McD was build on Viiru in Tallinn, and there was at least one in Mustamäe, Sprs Pst, by 95 or even earlier. Either update, prove or remove. —Preceding unsigned comment added by PoorLeno ( talk • contribs ) 23:07, 21 September 2007 (UTC) 

 A fact with no home 

It is a fact that no two countries with Macdonald&apos;s in them have declared war against each other (since the building of the establisment) I am not sure where this belongs, but it is a good place to start here.

 The Wiggle Fish 11:11, 6 September 2007 (UTC)
 Where&apos;s your evidence for that alleged fact? Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 13:24, 6 September 2007 (UTC) This is an idea developed by Thomas Friedman, the &quot;Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention.&quot; But it was proved wrong by the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, which had McDonald&apos;s at the time. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 140.233.137.241 ( talk ) 01:31, 5 November 2007 (UTC) Last I checked, NATO was not a country. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 130.68.47.79 ( talk ) 18:48, 17 December 2007 (UTC) 
 In Australia, Canola Oil used in French Fries 

Apparently the McDonald&apos;s website in Australia states that Canola Oil is used in the french fries, this is due largely to a step McDonalds has taken in posting all their nutritional information on their website. You can find evidence of the Canola Oil used here. http://www.mcdonalds.com.au/PDFs/IngredientListing.pdf 

This hasen&apos;t been listed anywhere and all thats stated is the use of Beef Tallow and the beef flavouring/animal flavouring that is apparently currently used, this is what made me look up what its like here and made me make these findings. Hope this helps..

 2001 Australian Court Case 

What about the 2001 court case in Australia? The company was sued for not honouring prizes that thousands of Australian&apos;s claimed to win legitimately. See the following link. http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s257577.htm 

 Arguments in defense of McDonald&apos;s 

I&apos;ld like to add the following paragraph under the above heading (which is already in use). It is a comment on how Mc Donalds have bowed to public pressure regarding the origins and wellfair of the food they serve:

In a bid to tap into growing consumer interest in the provenance of food, the fast-food chain recently switched its supply of both Coffee Beans and Milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: “British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing and ethics of the food and drink they buy&quot;. McDonalds Coffee is now brewed from beans taken from stocks that have been certified by the conservation group the Rainforest Alliance. Similarly Milk supplies used for its hot drinks and milkshakes have been switched to organic sources which could account for 5% of the UK&apos;s organic Milk output [ 1 ] . -- Robfisher21 11:49, 05 July 07 (UTC)
 Why is it considered the restaurant&apos;s responsibility to provide healthy food? People have the choice not to eat it if they don&apos;t want it. Continued purchase of a product justifies its existence, wouldn&apos;t you have to say? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 64.122.63.142 ( talk ) 20:04, 5 March 2008 (UTC) Sheep don&apos;t like to take initiative. They want someone else to take care of things. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 21:00, 5 March 2008 (UTC) 
 Innovation 

Love it or hate it, McDonald&apos;s has ushered in many innovations in the fast food industry -- above and beyond inventing the fast food industry. Many or most of the corporation&apos;s innovations are missing. Also missing is a fair accounting of its charitable works. These omissions leave the balance of the article highly negative -- in fact it reads like a thinly disguised bash job. OK, we get it, many of you don&apos;t like McDonald&apos;s. I&apos;m not a huge fan either, but this article demeans Wikipedia by allowing our biases to come thru. Let&apos;s highlight the success of the business, the franchise system, the economic democracy it represented for many years, its many innovations, and its charitable works, and let those facts balance a fair description of the legitimate criticisms of the company. -- Itsgeneb 13:57, 11 May 2007 (UTC) . Additional information that should be known. Most McDonalds in the USA do not provide paper towels in the restrooms, (environmentally concious, sort of) and most also have the restroom doors open inward. Due to the fact so many people use thess and a portion of them may have human waste on their hands, it creates an extremely unsanity environment (I have witnessed this fact, many times in many places, someone defecates and does not wash their hands, simply exists the room, sound and smell verifies what just happened). Even if the employees wash hands as required after using them, they have to touch the door handle and get human urine or human feces on them ,which subsequently transfers to your food. . Of note, at all restaurants I eat at, I look at the restrooms first, and if the doors open inward and no paper towels are provided to help preserve sanitary conditions (by using a towel in lieu of a glove to open the door), then I go elswhere. I doubt there are any McDonalds with a special employee only restroom. . Many others fall in the same category. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Manwithaplan v3 ( talk • contribs ) 00:56, August 20, 2007 (UTC). 

 &quot;McDs&quot; 

In the UK, it is known by Maccy Ds. It may be known as McDs in the North of England and Wales but for London and the south, it is definitely called Maccy Ds.

Correct, I&apos;ve never heard McD&apos;s and I live in the North! Bilky asko 16:17, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

Hah funnily enough I went to edit that into Maccy D&apos;s myself and found I couldn&apos;t edit it. I&apos;ve never heard of McDs or McD&apos;s myself, and I&apos;m from Nottingham (half way between north and south!). MaccyD&apos;s is all we&apos;ve ever called it here.

I&apos;ve heard it called Miccy D&apos;s. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.51.224.167 ( talk ) 23:05, 2 November 2007 (UTC)

 &quot;Maccas&quot; 

 Ansett   ( talk   · contribs ) keeps re-inserting the slang term &quot;Maccas&quot; into the head of the article. I can find no evidence whatsoever that this is an official name of the company , and hence, do not believe it belongs in the article at all, much less in the head. Any comments? Erik Swanson 07:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

Giving Ansett   ( talk   · contribs ) the benefit of the doubt, I assume &quot;Maccas&quot; is a local name for the restaurant. However, it is clearly not the legal and offical name of the company as Erik Swanson   ( talk   · contribs ) notes above. It should not be in the article. ND Conservative 06:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

To validate ((user|Ansett))&apos;s contribution, Maccas is actually a colloquial term used for McDonald&apos;s. I know it is used fairly frequently atleast in Australia. 12.106.111.10 22:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

As I presumed, however it is not equivalent to the legal entity known as the McDonald&apos;s Corporation. Ansett   ( talk   · contribs ) &apos;s information could be included in a &quot;McDonald&apos;s around the World&quot; section that would include the dozen of local names for McDonald&apos;s restaurants. ND Conservative 20:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Maccas&quot; is mainly used down here in Australia. Being a Maccas employee, I have seen the company actually use the term. I can try to find evidence that they do use the word, but I may have trouble finding it. - Vicer 07:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
 Just to add on, I managed to find some evidence that the company uses the term &quot;Maccas&quot;. http://makeupyourownmind.com.au/ - Watch the intro and the girl will say &quot; maccas &quot;. Also, go to the &quot;Front Counter&quot; Section of the e and click on &quot;Working at Maccas &quot;. I will try to locate more evidence. - Vicer 07:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC) I&apos;m convinced it&apos;s a common term for the company, but that page still has &quot;© 2006 McDonald&apos;s Australia&quot; (emphasis added) at the bottom. It would definitely belong in a section about worldwide differences in the resturants, or a laundry list of slang terms for McDoanalds. However, because it&apos;s not the legal name of the corporation , I don&apos;t believe it belongs in the head of the article. Erik Swanson 03:06, 9 December 2006 (UTC) I&apos;ve just sent a message to the company here in Australia asking if it is the legal name of the corporation . If need be I am prepared to send one to the US McDonald&apos;s. I should get a response within the week, and when I do, I&apos;ll post the outcome. BTW, I didn&apos;t say it should be in the head of the article. Maybe a redirection would be fine. - Vicer 10:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC) 
Thanks for looking into this Vicer. I suspect they will acknowledge that, while McDonald&apos;s is probably a registered corporation in every country in which they have a franchise, possibly under names such as McDonald&apos;s Australia, we will be able to conclude that McDonald&apos;s Corporation is the legal mother entity of all franchises and regional legal names. And secondly, there should be a section reflecting the regional nuances of McDonalds, both domestic and international, such as menu items, common names, unique business practices (I&apos;d be particularly interested to hear how McDonald&apos;s operate in Muslim countries, or in China). ND Conservative 16:48, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
 No problem mate. I just got the response from McDonald&apos;s Australia a few minutes ago. 
cshewel: To include regional slang names is silly. For example, in Winnipeg where I live, people often refer to McDonald&apos;s as McDick&apos;s or Pricker&apos;s. Should these be included in the head? I think not.
 There&apos;s our answer - Vicer 07:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC) Companies register nicknames as a matter of course, for legal reasons, without any intent that they are to become an official name. &quot;Maccas&quot; is not a worldwide name for the company, just a slang term for it in a single country. Pro hib it O ni o ns (T) 09:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC) 
I Don&apos;t think it really matters that much, right? Its just a name. Its is the registered trademark of McDonalds Austrailia. I went to their web site from their austrailian Branches and I found that they call them selves Maccas a lot. And as it said above McDonalds Austrailia made it their trademark for legal reasons and it really is just a slang word for McDonalds. User:EnsignLovel 
 Precisely. A similar instance was when McD&apos;s trademarked the name &quot;Mickey D&apos;s&quot; in the U.S. in the 1980s, after it had become a common slang term, and used it in a few commercials. It didn&apos;t change the name of the restaurant at all, and the name &quot;Mickey D&apos;s&quot; would not be used in formal writing to describe the company. The reasons why such names are trademarked should be obvious. Besides offering a cute/hip/friendly alternative term for use in advertising, this also protects the company from negative use of a widely understood nickname; no one can then market, say, &quot;Mickey D&apos;s brand desiccated horse manure&quot; or start &quot;Maccas Fat Farm&quot; - and it means the likes of stand-up comics would not be able to libel the company with impunity by use of the other term. The article did previously contain a list of slang terms for McDonald&apos;s (such as the above and &quot;McDo&quot; in French, the less complimentary &quot;McDoof&quot; in German, etc.), but this became a target for vandalism and was essentially unverifiable (&quot;McFuck&quot; in Polish? Very funny.). Pro hib it O ni o ns (T) 15:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC) 
Ask your self this , it takes roughly 30 minuts to make a heathly and tasty meal at home, if it takes only that much time, why would you need to go to McDonalds. it should be blindingly obvious that you don&apos;t need McDonalds. EnsignLovel 
 Because I would rather take 15 seconds out of my day to drive through and get 3 burgers off the dollar menu. Moralizing idiot. 
 How Many Are There? 

How many McDonalds are there? I heard there are more Subways in the US, but neither page has the numbers to compare (Subway page does list total # of Subways worldwide).

There are over 31 000 McDonalds world wide. And there are around 2 000 in Canada alone. Out of 170 countries there are 119 countries that have McDonalds living there. So that basicaly makes it imposible not visit one at least once in your life.(McDonalds also has pages listing # of Mcdonalds worldwide). In New York City there are more McDonalds than there are hospitals in Newfoundland. I know, CRAZY. Theres also many McDonalds in hospitals all over the world. The one place McDonalds sends you to if you eat to much of it (if you&apos;ve seen super size me) is where you can continue to eat their food! User:EnsignLovel 
 you&apos;re right ensignlovel, mcdonalds actively comes to your house, makes you eat their food, physically injures you, and sends you to the hospital. where it continues to make you eat their food. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 140.247.239.196 ( talk ) 01:27, 25 April 2007 (UTC). 
I disagree with the comment that it is impossible not to visit one at least once in your life. By not going into one, you simply avoid the issue. No-one forces you in

 the shrub picture 

okay, i deleted the picture of the shrub in the criticisms section has violating WP:NPOV ... although i&apos;ve got to say &quot;kudos&quot; to whoever came up with it. i laughed my ass off. really. -- frymaster 04:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
 I didn&apos;t realize that was a joke. I thought it was serious and I thought it was stupid that anyone would think that makes up for the crap McD&apos;s does. So it was supposed to be tounge-in-cheek? I guess I can see that. Ungovernable Force Poll: Which religious text should I read? 05:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC) I put it back, with a neutral caption. I might have posted the joke way back when, for some specific reason that I&apos;ve forgotten. It might just have been the middle of the night.

 Subliminal Ad on Food Network 

 http://youtube.com/watch?v=N3q5bh75m9k http://youtube.com/watch?v=LMzbwa6PvEE http://youtube.com/watch?v=amnZX-jjBD8 There should be something in this article about this terrible move by mcdonalds. REscano 08:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I disagree. If you read into it further, the clip was only 1 frame long, which is 1/30th of a second. If it was subliminal, it would have been for a couple of frames so you could have actually grasped what you had seen. Since it was at the end of a Food Network episode, experts in the advertisment field for TV networks say it was a glitch of an ad starting to early and then being cut off, which can and has happened before in the television industry. Its just that this person captured it and claimed it was subliminal.

 &quot;Can and has happened before&quot; is understating it. I see it every day on cable TV. A &quot;national&quot; ad for some product will start, and a &quot;local&quot; ad will jump in and take its place. Many myths have started by misinterpretations like that. Wahkeenah 11:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC) 

No Anon, it was subliminal. Even though its hard to grasp it, your brain does register it. I say we add it Toasty! | Available at your local store 19:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

 So-called subliminal ads have never been demonstrated to have any influence. That kind of thing amounts to nothing more than urban legend. Wahkeenah 19:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC) 

 user talk 

I Think making a page where people can post their thoughts and questions would be a good Idea so help me out here. EnsignLovel 
 haha you mean like a discussion page? Like this one? 
I think thats a good idea Silver2007 

another section needs to be included about the new call center drive up window operator that takes the order

Somebody needs to put a picture of the Springdale, Arkansas McDonalds with the airplane on top.

Maybe someone should mention the recent small clips that may have been made in response to Supersize Me? There are heaps out there, for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpDJpg2eW4o . This is a link to a clip of YouTube where a teenager eats a burger that is 8 times the size of a quarter pounder? Does this hold health concerns, maybe this is an issue that should be considered?

 OPNAD Fund, Inc.

 Veggie Burger 

I was reading a nutrition book, and it said McDonald&apos;s had a veggie burger. Is this really true? I don&apos;t see an article.

 Thank you for volunteering to write it. Actually, they do have one. Take a Big Mac, throw away the meat patties, and voila! Wahkeenah 23:16, 12 March 2007 (UTC) 

Actually, it&apos;s called the McVeggie. I went on Google, and I found images of the McVeggie, but it says it&apos;s in Canada. It&apos;s not there anymore according to McDonalds&apos; Canada Menu .

 introductory para should not be in the past tense. mcdonalds still exists. 
 With the successful expansion of McDonald&apos;s into many international markets, the company became a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence also made it a frequent subject of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics and consumer responsibility. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 140.247.239.196 ( talk ) 01:22, 25 April 2007 (UTC). 
 Thomas Friedman&apos;s theory 

I wonder if the so-called Israel-Lebanon war of 2006 really belongs in this list. The war wasn&apos;t actually between Israel and Lebanon (both of which have McDonald&apos;s franchises), but between Israel and Hezbullah.

 Elimination of taboos 

&quot;McDonald&apos;s led to the easing or elimination of various taboos, such as eating while walking in Japan.&quot;

Well, I&apos;ve lived in Japan for six years now and I have to say that eating while walking is still very much a taboo in the sense that:

1. It is almost never seen
2. Parents teach their children not to do it
3. You are stared at if you do it

 McCafe items now in Michigan McDonald&apos;s restaurants

 Photo Details Incorrect 

The photo labled as &apos;A McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Times Square.&apos; is incorrect. It&apos;s actually the 42nd Street store in NYC. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 60.228.16.6 ( talk ) 13:03, 8 May 2007 (UTC). 
It&apos;s about 100 yards off 7th Avenue, so only the most limited definition of Times Square would fail to include that McDonald&apos;s. Nearly any New Yorker would describe that as Times Square. However, it wouldn&apos;t hurt to mention its precise location.-- Itsgeneb 13:45, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

 So fix it already. Wahkeenah 13:52, 11 May 2007 (UTC) 

 Nutritional Information? 

I think that McDonald&apos;s has had nutritional information on its packaging for the last year or so, and also a &quot;Daily Intake&quot; Guide, whatever that is. I&apos;m not sure whether this is important enough to change, but I know that in Australia, at least, almost all items have nutritional info printed on the underside of the clam. Jamessugrono 09:11, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

 I think Australia had it before most places. It&apos;s been on UK packaging since earlier this year, but we have always had nutritional information available in the store in some form or another for as long as I can remember. Beeurd 12:52, 5 June 2007 (UTC) 

 Drive Thru Info 

The drive through was first introduced in Arizona near an army base, as soldiers were often disciplined for leaving their trucks off site to enter the McDonalds. To combat this, the idea came of putting a window in the side of the building so that the soldier&apos;s could pay for and collect their food without having to leave their trucks.

 Unnecessary Wiffle-waffle??? 

&quot;McDonald&apos;s also flattens the social strata during dining — there is no problem of losing face for certain customers (who might be embarrassed when someone else ordered a more expensive item in a restaurant); the food at McDonald&apos;s is all similarly priced.&quot;

Is this comment useful or is it an unnecessary space filler? There are plenty of other restaurants that have menus with &apos;similarly&apos; priced food that don&apos;t contain such a sentence in their wikipedia description. 72.130.181.181 05:16, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

 It&apos;s unsourced, and is likely someone&apos;s editorial comment. It should be deleted. Baseball Bugs 12:40, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

 I want to change chicken to chickenburger 

{{ Editprotected }}

I want to change chicken to chickenburger where it states that McDonald´s sell hamburgers, chicken, I wish to change the chicken to chickenburgers.
 We don&apos;t appear to have an article at chickenburger , nor am I sure I&apos;ve ever heard them called that. If you would be so kind, could you provide a reliable source to verify that this is the appropriate term, before we make any changes? Thanks in advance. – Luna Santin ( talk ) 21:17, 8 July 2007 (UTC) 

I think you are actually rigth. At McDonald´s it is called McChicken and not Chickenburger.

Thank you. D´Artgnan 21:47, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

 Criticism re cancer 

 Rotten has reverted the following
 
- On 10 July 2007 the American Association for Cancer Research associated the western-style Meat-Sweet diet (e.g. Big Mac and Coke) with increased rates of Breast Cancer . [ 2 ] 
 
on the grounds that the (recent) ref article doesn&apos;t mention MacDonalds. This is literally true but I believe irrelevant. MacDonalds is the iconic representative of the diet referred to in the ref. It will inevitably be the target of lawsuits if the ref study is borne out. Discussion? LeadSongDog 16:54, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
 Maybe you could wait until there actually is a lawsuit. Baseball Bugs 17:48, 10 July 2007 (UTC) There&apos;s enough criticism of McDonald&apos;s on here. Plus it&apos;s a potentially liabelous allegation that McDonald&apos;s causes cancer. -- Rotten 18:32, 10 July 2007 (UTC) Perhaps there&apos;s a need for a more general Western Diet article.

Since asking about the immortal french fries I have found the cause and it seems I was right in it tieing in with the cancer bit. This is the original video that I watched. http://youtube.com/watch?v=G6qGKNwdeCQ 

It is caused by a chemical called acrylamide which is created from a reaction between an amino acid called, asparagine, reacts with naturally occuring sugars. It only happens under high heat and because of Mcdonalds and other fast food joints making smaller french fries and increasing the heat of the oil more acrymalide is formed than would be with fries made at home or in a small burger joint. They also use potatoes that are higher in sugar allowing even more acrymalide to be produced. It isn&apos;t just Mcfries or even fries period that this reaction occurs. There are a large variety of food and drinks that are prepared at high heat in which this reaction occurs.

According to the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminates (think they names long enough) there is a possible health risk from acrylamide and while it is known to cause cancer in animals the level of threat to human life is not known. I&apos;m not sure whether any of this should be put here since it isn&apos;t just mcdonalds food that is at risk but here are my sources. And if your ever on altering time thank OldGuy for the sources. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/chem-chim/acrylamide/acrylamide_and_food-acrylamide_et_aliment_e.html http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/acrylamide/frenchfries-EN-final.pdf Olstar —Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.14.203.32 ( talk ) 15:39, 20 September 2007 (UTC) 
 
Immortal fries?

I watched that video where mcdonalds food items were put into jars to see how long it took them to rot. In the video 10 weeks go by and there was no sign of mold or any other form of decay. Does anyone know if it was a hoax or if the fries realy do not rot and just what part of the recipe has this effect.

 Removed text re Pakistan McDonald&apos;s 

The following was in the section on global impact -- I removed it as it doesn&apos;t seem to have any encyclopedic relvance to this section, but am preserving it here just in case someone wants to source it and reuse it elsewhere:
 The effect of McDonald&apos;s in Asia is that the busiest McDonald&apos;s in Southeast Asia is in Karachi, Pakistan . It has over 50 counters and has a large area for children to play also it has halal meat for its Muslim customers. Its mounthly income is around $40,000, which is a great boost for the company.

 A bit about Kroc 
 Ray kroc was a 52 year-old Multimixer milkshake machine salesman when he first met Maurice and Richard McDonald. The McDonald&apos;s restaurant in San Bernardino, California was he best customers. When Ray Kroc received an order of eight milkshake machines (enough to make 40 milkshakes at once) he had to see the operation for himself.
 He found out why so many customers came from miles around, because of these tree factors: 
1. Fast, friendly service 2. Consistant quality for it&apos;s burgers, shakes and fries 3. Low prices
 The McDonalds brothers could have made the business into what it is today. However, they both hated to fly, so they may have opened another in California, but not a world-wide franchise like today. In 1955, Kroc offered to form a partnership, so he could create identical McDonalds throughout the country. In 1961, Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for 2.7 million dollars (around 200 million today). Kroc stuck to the original recipes, so everyone would be eating the same thing. Today there are 30 000 outlets in 118 countries, turning it into a multi-billion dollar corporation. 
Just a random fact about McDoanlds: It is the largest toy distributer in the world.

User Sicherlich keeps deleting the gallery and making some vague statement about a &quot;commons&quot;. He needs to explain what he&apos;s getting at, and why he keeps deleting it here. I have no idea what he&apos;s talking about. Baseball Bugs 19:17, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

 International expansion 

I&apos;ve scanned the article and the talk page and couldn&apos;t really find anything listing McDonald&apos;s arrival in different countries around the world; it was in pursuit of this information that I came to the article in the first place.

There is a perfectly understandable version of this list on the French version of the page (though without a visible citation) and I was wondering if this information should be added to the article, or perhaps on a separate article linked to from &apos;See also&apos; and &apos;expansion of McDonald&apos;s into many international markets&apos; or &apos;McDonald&apos;s restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world&apos;.

 Behind the Arches 

Wired have pointed at an edit caught by the Wikipedia scanner ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=6077389 ) that replces the link to Fast Food Nation with &apos;McDonalds: Behind the Arches.&apos; This edit has since been reverted, but if &apos;Behind the Arches&apos; is a reasonable reference, perhaps it should be added to the list as well? Ubermammal 07:53, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
 I&apos;ve read &apos;Behind the Arches&apos;, and referenced it for a psychology paper I wrote a couple of years ago. From memory, it was written independently (not for McDonald&apos;s), but I think, at least at the time, was the only publication approved by McDonalds (though I&apos;m not sure on this). It is well researched and presents an unbiased view on the history and development of McDonald&apos;s. It is very much a reasonable reference. Tinkstar1985 11:00, 13 January 2008 (UTC) 
 PlayPlace/Playland 
 Some McDonald&apos;s in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds , called &quot;McDonald&apos;s PlayPlace&quot;
 (if indoors) or &quot;Playland&quot; (outdoors). The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was
 introduced in 1987 in the USA, with many more being constructed soon after. Some PlayPlace playgrounds have been renovated into &quot;R Gym&quot; areas. 
I have seen an indoor version of a Playland, so I&apos;m going to mark it. Bilky asko 10:59, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

 Delivery 

Should it be mentioned that some McDonald&apos;s offer delivery services in the part of the article that discusses drive-thru and walk-thru? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 69.116.74.32 ( talk ) 00:11, 1 September 2007 (UTC) 

 More then half of this article is other peoples who don&apos;t like the company 

Just because someone wrote a book, doesn&apos;t make their opinions important or valid. Most of this article is about authors of movies and books and their views about the company. Can we get rid of all that crap. It would be a kin to an article about apples and more then half the article about movies and books who&apos;s authors don&apos;t like apples. What is happening to Wikipedia. It has become a forum for people to bitch about stuff. Even if you are site a book to bitch about something, your still bitching about it. I don&apos;t like baseball, should I go to the Yankees article and fill it half way full of books who complain about baseball and the Yankees?

I came here to see how many locations McDonalds has in the US and overseas.. I see in the article they have over 30k stores but not how many are over seas. I also wanted to know how much they spend in charity each year and how Mcdonalds stacks up against other restaurants in the US.. Things that would be interesting, a list of menu items, Items which are no longer on the menu, what the most popular items are. There is so little in this article about the company, it is sad. I suggest making a bitch page, Call it critics of McDonalds and move all the critical views about the company and fast food and put it there. Mantion 08:10, 3 September 2007 (UTC)
 Just another sad case of wikibashing. This article gives little credit to Mcdonald&apos;s strides in economics, invention, and charity. whatever damage they have supposedly done has been more than compensated for by their contributions.

 McDonald&apos;s actually founded in Monrovia, CA(NOT San Bernardino!)... 

NO matter how many times many people have tried to prove that the McDonald brothers(Dick and Mac[aka Richard and Maurice]) actually started what would become McDonald&apos;s in Monrovia, it ALWAYS gets deleted as &quot;not true&quot;, always bowing down to McDonald&apos;s corporate HQ in Oak Brook, where THEIR version of its history is the &quot;law of the land&quot;...

This is the official story:in 1940, the McDonald brothers started their business(cfalled the &quot;Airdrome&quot;, a round-shaped building) on Huntington Drive in Monrovia, CA(at the old Monrovia Airport), where they sold hamburgers for 10 cents and all-you-can-drink orange juice for five cents...their version of &quot;franchising&quot; was whenever there was a McDonald relative in a nearby town, there was a McDonald&apos;s(their mother lived in nearby Azusa, hence a McDonald&apos;s was on Foothill Boulevard, next door to the now-closed Foothill Drive-In theater, plus the one in Downey where a cousin lived);in 1948, the brothers moved the whole building to the southwest corner of 14th and &quot;E&quot; Streets in San Bernardino(now the headquarters of the regional Juan Pollo restaurant chain).In 1955 Ray Kroc came to town and inquired about the brothers&apos; success...and the rest is &quot;corporate history&quot;...

Now like I&apos;ve said before, every time someone tried to provide proof about this version of history, it was promptly deleted, and I wish it would be taken as the REAL story of the early years of the McDonald&apos;s that we Monrovians knew and loved... Baldwin91006 17:10, 25 September 2007 (UTC)
 What proof? Can you site a reliable, published secondary source for that information? Because that is the only &quot;proof&quot; acceptable on Wikipedia. Natalie 17:44, 25 September 2007 (UTC) 
Hey, Natalie, did you read the whole thing?...Michaela just said that everytime she tried to edit this page, it was promptly deleted BEFORE she could provide(cite) the proof necessary to remain...good grief!...give her a break... Baldwin91006 02:48, 27 September 2007 (UTC)
 I did some searching on the internet to try to the find the correct information on Mcdonald’s founding. I couldn’t find a definitive history and the information that I did find was sometimes contradictory. The history section of McDonald’s website mentions Dick and Mac McDonald Mcdonald’s in San Bernardino, California , but lacks detail about the history their business. From the information that I found on the internet, I constructed a timeline: 
 1937 - Dick and Mac McDonald opened the Airdrome, a hot dog stand located in either Monrovia, California or Arcadia, California . 1940- Dick and Mac McDonald closed the Airdrome, and then opened McDonald’s a barbecue drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California. Some websites stated that they moved the building that had been used for the Airdrome to use for McDonald’s. 1948- Dick and Mac McDonald closed McDonald’s for several months and reopened it as a fast-food restaurant. This is the version that was franchised across the county. 1955- Ray Kroc opened his first franchise, though there were several franchises before his. 
 Getting back to Baldwin91006’s issue that McDonalds was founded in Monrovia, the question is whether the Airdrome is actually part of the Mcdonald’s history. I would say no, but I’m open to other people’s opinions. Another issue is whether the Airdrome was in Monrovia or Arcadia. The History of McDonald&apos;s article says Arcadia and Dick and Mac McDonald article says Monrovia. On other websites I found each mentioned about the same amount. BlueAzure 02:37, 2 October 2007 (UTC) The restaurant that caught multimixer salesman Ray Kroc&apos;s attention was in San Bernardino. It may be an interesting and noteworthy fact that the Mac brothers own original restaurant was in Monrovia, and could be added to the article as a part of the Mac brothers history, but that&apos;s a separate deal from the franchise. The franchising began when the brothers were in San Bernardino. Technically, the first franchised restaurant was in Des Plaines, IL. In any case, to try to claim that the corporation began in Monrovia is not correct. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 02:48, 2 October 2007 (UTC) 
Oh, you are SO WRONG!...my research(though limited, thanks to family concerns) says that McDonald&apos;s WAS founded in Monrovia(not neighboring Arcadia), plus:
 The Airdrome was moved(piece by piece) to San Bernardino in 1948 where the &quot;unofficial&quot; McDonald&apos;s museum is now located(at the southwest corner of 14th and E Streets)...unfortunately, if you choose to go there, the &quot;curator&quot; still maintains the official &quot;story&quot; that McDonalds DID start in San Bernardino, despite repeated requests to change the story, even though the Monrovia Historical Society says otherwise. 
Besides, when Dick and Mac moved the Airdrome to San Bernardino, it wasn&apos;t to start a BBQ restaurant, it was to improve on the changing tastes of the teenage population of the Inland Empire(not just SAn Bernardino, but the neighboring cities as well);only then did they change to what would be considered a &quot;fast-food&quot; store, and in 1948, the change was deemed successful...but it was in 1955, when Ray Kroc, forced the brothers to hand over the stoer and turn it into a overnight sensation(especially by &quot;franchising&quot; the Des Plaines(IL) store)...up until their deaths, McDonald&apos;s tried to ensure the brothers&apos; way of historic events was not believed by the public... Baldwin91006 17:22, 2 October 2007 (UTC)
 It sounds like you&apos;ve got some sort of personal axe to grind against McDonald&apos;s. Don&apos;t confuse the McDonald&apos;s own store with the corporation. The corporation did not begin in Monrovia, no matter how you slice it. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 20:22, 2 October 2007 (UTC) As the article is currently written Dick and Mac McDonald ’s McDonald’s and the corporation created by Ray Kroc are not treated as separate entities. The infobox and the category section both list the founding of the company as 1940, which is when Dick and Mac McDonald opened the original version of McDonald’s not when Ray Kroc created his corporation. BlueAzure 00:07, 3 October 2007 (UTC) And according to your own timeline, their 1940 store was in San Bernardino. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 00:20, 3 October 2007 (UTC) I guess your not disagreeing that Dick and Mac McDonald are part of the McDonald’s history anymore. If so, then the issue is whether the Airdrome is part of the McDonald’s history. I don’t think it is, but if it is then the company was founded in either Monrovia or Arcadia. BlueAzure 01:29, 3 October 2007 (UTC) The company was founded whenever and wherever it says it was founded. Arguments to the contrary, solely on your part or mine, constitute &quot;original research&quot;. Now, if you can find an authoritative published source that explicitly contradicts McDonald&apos;s spin on things, then you&apos;ve got something. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 02:01, 3 October 2007 (UTC) Could you tell me what “McDonald&apos;s spin on things” is? As I mentioned in my original post the history section of McDonald’s website doesn’t provide details of the companies founding, and I couldn’t find anything else from the company with that information. BlueAzure 02:41, 3 October 2007 (UTC) As I recall, their website dates the corporation&apos;s founding to 1955 or 1956, when the franchis operation began. So the 1940 in this article must itself be &quot;original research&quot;. It&apos;s fair to state it as background, as a precursor, but the corporation was not &quot;founded&quot; in 1940. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 03:32, 3 October 2007 (UTC) Could provide a link to the page with that information, then I can go ahead and update the article. BlueAzure 02:43, 5 October 2007 (UTC) 
 Legal cases 

Why is there a paragraph/summary of the legal cases that reflect poorly on the company but the other case where mcdonald&apos;s is shown in a more favorable light just a link? SecretaryNotSure 07:46, 29 September 2007 (UTC)

Is it really appropriate for an encyclopedia article about a company to spend a few paragraphs on what the company does, where it&apos;s located... and then page after page of every nitnoid complaint someone has had? Like, is it really necessary for the understanding of the McDonald&apos;s Corp that we learn that there were 5 workers that were either too young or working too late in the evening at a mcdonald&apos;s restaurant in Australia? ... as if that is something that gives us insight into mcdonald&apos;s corp? Doesn&apos;t that sort of thing sound like it was added by someone who has something against the company? SecretaryNotSure 08:01, 29 September 2007 (UTC)

There&apos;s a lot of legal cases described throughout the article. I was thinking of sweeping all the various lawsuits and descriptions up and putting them in the legal section. It&apos;s just that in every section, someone is suing the company for something. In addition to that, there&apos;s a wiki article on &quot;legal cases&quot; all by itself. SecretaryNotSure 13:00, 5 October 2007 (UTC)
 Listing every case McDonald&apos;s has against it amounts to POV-pushing. The reason McD&apos;s gets sued more often than White Castle, for example, is that they&apos;re a much bigger fish. That doesn&apos;t mean White Castle is any better for you nutritionally. Baseball Bugs What&apos;s up, Doc? 13:12, 5 October 2007 (UTC) I had the same problem while editing the Burger King article, I created a section called Controversies, disputes and legal issues and put only the cases that are most pertinent to the chain. I made sure to include both the accusers&apos; and BK&apos;s side of the story. I kept it short and sweet, about eight to ten paragraphs in length, about four to five for the major sub-sections in the section. A simple summary statement like Labor issues and disputes have arisen in various parts of the world, primarily over wages, and then stating a more recent and high profile case as an example. Just a thought - Jeremy ( Jerem43 22:10, 5 October 2007 (UTC)) Sounds like a good approach. This is supposed to be an encylopedia, i.e. a summary... not the Law Review .

 Global Impact (American Imperialism?) 

Quote: &quot;Because McDonald&apos;s is closely identified with American culture and lifestyle, its international business expansion has been termed [by who?] part of Americanization and American cultural imperialism.&quot; This seems very out of line, does not site any sources, and does not seem like a neutral perspective to me. Yes, McDonalds is a prime example of American capitalism--both the positive and the negative-- but to call it &quot;American cultural imperialism&quot; seems to be going too far. Anyone else agree? ( 75.50.101.192 ( talk ) 07:41, 26 November 2007 (UTC))
