The country&apos;s first-ever airplane restaurant will be opened in Dhaka inside the shell of the F-28 aircraft that crashed near Sylhet airport earlier this year.

The restaurant is the brainchild of Captain Mostafa Aolad, a Bangladeshi expatriate pilot in London, who owns two such restaurants in the UK.

&quot;I always dreamed of doing something for my country. And this is a small initiative to fulfill my dream. I believe this restaurant will attract tourists,&quot;said Captain Mostafa.

Captain Mostafa is hopeful about launching the restaurant by the next three months. It will have the capacity of serving 100 people at a time.

&quot;There are many people in the country who have never got a chance to get into an airplane. They will be able to enjoy the real in-flight hospitality while visiting the restaurant,&quot;said Captain Mostafa.

Mostafa joins hands with local food shop Western Grill to establish the restaurant at an estimated cost of Tk 1 crore. They have already purchased the shell of the aircraft from Biman Bangladesh Airlines at Tk 11 lakh through tender.

They have brought the plane to Dhaka and set it up near Ashulia.&quot;We have bought 3 bighas of land and work is going on to turn it into a virtual airport,&quot;said Mostafa.

They are also looking for an alternative and convenient place for the city dwellers to establish the unique kind of restaurant.

 The atmosphere around the restaurant will be similar to that of an airport. One has to reach the restaurant through a runway.

This runway will take the guests into a terminal building with a 3,000 square feet reception area where the guests would enjoy music and can take light food. 

And then the guests will enter the restaurant where waiters dressed up as cabin crew serve them with European, Chinese and Indian food.

&quot;We have refurbished the aircraft. Even its cockpit will be a realistic one,&quot;Mostafa said.

Besides taking food, the guests will be able to visit every corner of the aircraft along with trained guides. There will be a children&apos;s corner too.

An aircraft restaurant is not quite unheard of in the developed parts of the world. But in this region, it is definitely a unique place for dining out. Western Grill, the city&apos;s popular fast food joint has achieved this unique feat.

 

Converting an abandoned F-28 aircraft into a restaurant, has made Western Grill a more popular dineout. The F-28 aircraft was collected from a debris, a few months back. Ever since acquiring the aircraft, the management had been toying with the idea of turning it into a small, cosy restaurant.
The restaurant finally opened on June 9, 2006. The front half of the aircraft is now the restaurant, named, Western Grill Aircraft Restaurant, F-28. The aircraft is stationed on a ground floor reception area. As one goes up the stairs, the aircraft restaurant is right there.
Neatly uniformed cabin crew welcome the guests. The boarding card, which is in fact the buffet price, has to be collected from the reception area, after paying for the meal.
The restaurant serves only buffet meals. It is a 25 item buffet for lunch and a 30 item buffet for dinner every day. The menu is basically Thai, Chinese and Sichuan. But a number of items can be replaced as per the guest&apos;s choose. This provision is usually for parties.
Since it is an aircraft, the sitting arrangement has not been changed. As one steps into the restaurant, one can choose from any of the four seaters, on both sides of the aisle. At the far end of the restaurant is the VIP Cabin. Very true to its name, it has some, special features. This cabin is well-equipped with internet connections, a telephone and a TV.
The aircraft can accommodate around 60 passenger-cum-guests. With a prior notice, one can also book it for small parties. The food is ordered over a walkie talkie making it feel much more like an aeroplane ride! The children&apos;s park Wonderland is the landing station of this F-28 aircraft restaurant. Wonderland at Gulshan-2 is very much popular with the kids here. Along with its present star attractions, this restaurant is one more.
It is open from 12 noon till midnight. During this long 12 hour flight schedule, it is open for all those who loves to combine a meal with a little bit of fun! The meal could be described as something usual, but the venue and the setting makes the place the most unusual dineout of the city right now!
