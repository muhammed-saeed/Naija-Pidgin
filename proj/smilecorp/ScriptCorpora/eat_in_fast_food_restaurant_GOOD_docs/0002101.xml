How to Manage your Blood Sugar Level at fast food restaurants.
 An occasional visit to a fast-food restaurant is pretty much the lifestyle of many people in ourdays. When you eat a meal, your blood sugar generally rises. For a diabetic, not being careful can send your levels to the roof. Always keep in mind the&quot;big picture&quot;when you order at fast food restaurants. Order foods that will keep you on track with your diabetes diet, and foods that will maintain your blood sugar level in range.

 Tips to keep Blood Sugar Levels in range at Fast Foods Restaurants 

 Tip #1: - Know your numbers. . 
Many restaurants make their menus available online. Do your homework before you go. Some of them will make the nutritional content of each item available on their website. As a diabetic, you should always go for the&quot;low-calorie foods&quot;to keep your calories and blood sugar level for the day in balance.
If you can not find your favorite fast food or restaurant on the web, try this awesome food search tool at www.Live-Well-Now.com/content_food_search.htm 

 Tip #2: - Go for the&quot;baked or grilled&quot;option.. 
If a chicken breast sandwich is on the menu, usually they will also offer a breaded and grilled option. Stay away from the fried chicken, chips, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zukinis, or fried anything. Diabetics are at a higher risk for heart disease and high cholesterol levels when eating foods cooked in saturated fat.

 Tip #3: - A Salad may NOT be the best option.. 
Beware of the high-calorie salad. It&apos;s great that fast food restaurants are finally offering healthier foods like salads. But, be cautious of the ingredients. A salad loaded with cheese, croutons, bacon bits, creamy dressing - you get the idea - can be just as fattening as a McDonald quarter pounder with cheese. Check the nutrition facts before you order or do your homework before you go out to eat.(see tip #1).

 Tip #4: - Ask for&quot;WATER&quot;instead of sodas or fruit juices.. 
Save yourself a few hundred calories by ordering water with your meals instead of Sodas and fruit juices. they are loaded with sugar and calories that can send your blood sugar level way up. Water is calorie-free and sugar-free.

Why Water? - Soft Drinks&amp;Blood Sugar

Sugar Content in Non-Diet Soft Drinks
 Did you know that 1 can (12 ounce) of non-diet soft drink contains 40 gram or more(10 teaspoons) of sugar?
Yep. And that ads up to around 140 to 180 calories!

 Sugar Content in Popular Non-Diet Soft Drinks 
soft drink size: 1 can (12 fl. oz )or (360 ml)
sugar measurement: gram (gr)

1 can Minute Maid Orange Soda, 48gr
1 can Mountain Dew, 46gr
1 can Pepsi, 41gr
1 can Dr Pepper, 40gr
1 can Coca-Cola Classic, 39gr
1 can 7Up, 39gr
1 can Sprite, 38gr

 Drinking lots of water can flush toxins from the body and lower blood sugar levels. 
Water forms about 70 % of our body weight. Every organ in our body needs water to function.

 Water will: 
regulate your body temperature,
remove toxins and wastes from your body,
lubricate your joints,
keep your kidneys healthy.
protect your tissue, organs and your spinal cord from shock and damage.

 In conclusion: 
Water is very important for the smooth functioning of our bodies systems. It is correctly said that &apos; water is life &apos;. We can live without food for about a month, but it would not be possible to live more than a week without water.

Warning Signs of High Blood Sugar Level

The early signs of high blood sugar level
 Having a high blood sugar level is a symptom of diabetes, and it should be taken very seriously by anyone experiencing certain bodily effects. The early signs that your blood sugar is to high are:

Headache
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Excessive urination
Excessive thirst and hunger
Sudden weight loss
Delay in healing of wounds
Dry and itchy skin
Repeated infections

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and you are concerned, you should consult your Doctor. 
Self Testing of your Blood Sugar Level

The Best Test for Day-to-Day Diabetes Control
 
 Why should I check my blood sugar? 
Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose, or SMBG , with a meter helps you see how food, physical activity, and medicine affect your blood sugar/glucose levels. The readings you get can help you manage your diabetes day by day or even hour by hour. Keep a record of your test results and review it at each visit with your health care provider
.
 How do I test my own blood sugar? 
To do SMBG, you use a tiny drop of blood and a meter to measure your blood glucose level. Be sure you know how to do the test the correct way. Also, ask your doctor whether your meter gives the results as plasma or whole blood glucose. Most new meters provide the results as plasma glucose.

 How often should I check my blood sugar? 
Self-tests are usually done before meals, after meals, and/or at bedtime. People who take insulin usually need to test more often than those who do not take insulin. Ask your health care team when and how often you need to check your blood sugar.

 The guidelines for blood sugar can vary a little from person to person, but below are the average results to give you a general idea of what it should be.

When you wake up(before breakfast) - 80 to 120mg/dl 
Before meals - 80 to 120mg/dl 
2 hours after meals - 160mg/dl or less
At bedtime - 100 to 140mg/dl
