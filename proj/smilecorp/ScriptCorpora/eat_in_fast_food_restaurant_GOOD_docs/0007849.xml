Try to visualize the physical movements  of the person, and write a description of the performance for the sports  and entertainment section of your local newspaper. Use concrete details  and imaginative comparisons to help your readers appreciate what you  saw. Is  there a special object or family tradition that is important to everyone  in your family? For example, do you have an heirloom that has been handed  down through generations, a quilt your grandmother made, or a special  way of celebrating birthdays? For a younger relative - perhaps even  for someone who hasn&apos;t been born yet - describe this family treasure  or tradition in as much detail as you can. For  an audience of your classmates, write a description of a particular  time and place that you know well, such as your room on a rainy afternoon,  the video arcade after school, or the waiting area at your doctor&apos;s  office on a busy day. Use as many specific sensory details a you can.  Try to capture the moment - and share how you felt about it. For  a class anthology, describe a bird, an insect, or animal that you have  strong feelings about. Choose one that scares amuses, or puzzles you.  Be sure you know enough about the animal to describe it fully. Use sensory  details that will make your classmates feel the same. Imagine  you&apos;ve been asked to explain to a group of students from a foreign country  how to prepare a hot dog for lunch. They have never eaten a hot dog  before and do not know anything about them. Tell them each step you  take in preparing a hot dog. You  have been chosen to represent your school at an international convention  for students. This convention will take place during your family&apos;s scheduled  summer vacation, and it is being held in Paris, France. You will be  traveling alone. Write a composition as if you were explaining this  situation to a friend. Write about the good and bad aspects of attending  this convention. Explain each of your points completely. Many  young people your age read very little. They get their news and information  from television and the movies. They would rather read a magazine than  a novel. No one is quite sure why this is true, but many people are  concerned about the situation. Your teacher has asked you and your classmates  to write essays which explain your thoughts about the causes of this  situation. Your essays will be shared with other students in your school.  Your teacher hopes that these essays will help the school develop a  program to increase the popularity of reading for pleasure. Are  there any problems in your school? Do you get too little time to eat  lunch? Between classes is it hard to find a water fountain that works?  In a letter, make your school principal aware of the problem and suggest  a solution. Be sure to explain what the causes of the problem are, who  is affected by it, and how something could be done to solve it. Your  school is having a health awareness day. For the occasion, write a short  composition about a health problem you think is avoidable. Begin with  a brief explanation of the problem - how it comes about, who is affected  by it, and how. Then tell how you think people could prevent this problem.  In conclusion, either urge your readers to follow your advice or warn  them what may happen if they don&apos;t. Does  somebody do something that really drives you crazy? Do you have a friend  who always insists on being in charge? Is there someone in your class  who always takes credit for other people&apos;s work? Choose something that  bothers you. Now take a moment to figure out a way to solve this problem.  Then write a composition in which you describe the problem and explain  your proposed solution to it. Address your composition to others who  are also troubled by this behavior. Think  about some of the problems in your community that affect you and your  friends. Choose a problem that concerns you. Then prepare a brief written  report in which you state the problem, and offer a solution to it. In  your report, make clear to your neighbors why they should do something  about the problem. Do  you have a special relationship with someone? Take a moment now to consider  why this person matters to you and what he or she adds to your life.  Then write an essay in which you define the role of this individual  in your life. You might begin with words like &quot;An aunt is someone who...&quot;  Plan to share this essay with the person about whom you are writing. Most  hobbies and sports have special words to describe the equipment and  the plays unique to that activity. For example, chess players talk of  rooks and pawns, and baseball players speak of knuckle balls and sliders.  Imagine you are helping to write a manual for beginners in a hobby or  sport you know well. Write an explanation of an important term that  all beginners need to understand. Choose  a custom or holiday that you enjoy or that has special meaning to you.  For instance, do you love celebrating Independence Day? Hanukah? In  a letter to a pen pal, explain the practice or event you have chosen.  As you write, remember that this pen pal lives in another country and  knows nothing of your customs or holidays. A  magazine for children is conducting a survey on children&apos;s taste in  movies. The editors want you to compare and contrast a movie that is  in the theaters now with your favorite film of all time, and then draw  a conclusion about what makes a movie great.

After  he takes your lunch money every day, a bigger kid warns he&apos;ll hurt you  if you tell anyone. Since you don&apos;t believe in fighting to solve problems,  what other actions might you take?

Invention  and technology have always been an important part of changing the way  one lives.
