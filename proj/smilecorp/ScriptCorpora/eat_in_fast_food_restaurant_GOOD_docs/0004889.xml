 May 26, 2012 Really likes it Falafel Taco? by Hatti ( 37 reviews ) YES! Unbelievable. I was there yesterday and had the Falafel Taco - YUM. It had an heirloom tomato and cucumber&quot;salsa&quot;with avocado cream. It was so fresh and delicious. I&apos;m crazy about this place. The people are so passionate about their food. Happy One Year birthday! I&apos;m anxious to try the porter. Congrats. +2 more review from Hatti April 14, 2012 Yes Every time I go to Smoke, I have a new favorite. The rib taco is outstanding. I love the mac and cheese. The black beans are a must, and the service is great. You can tell these folks know what they are doing. Thanks! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful June 26, 2012 Best birthday ever. Your food, kindness, and passion are the reason we love this place. Thank you for today. Priceless. July 1, 2012 Likes it You cant go wrong! by Pittsburgher ( 38 reviews ) I ordered the mac and cheese, a pork taco, and a rib taco. The mac and cheese was not the way I usually like it, but still great! I ate the rib taco first and it blew me away. I regreted not just ordering 2 of these, then I ate the pork taco, and it was even better. The habenaro/ apricot sauce compliments the smoked pork perfectly. My freind ordered the brisket taco and said that it is also a winner! May 23, 2012 Likes it BBQ or... by George ( 7 reviews ) Heard some good things about Smoke and agree! Smoke is BBQ/Mexican, smoked meats on homemade tortillas. Chose the Pork taco with apricot habanero sauce and caramelized onions which had some interesting combination of flavors and some heat. Bisket was made fiery with chili peppers and a mustards sauce, not for the the faint of heat. The Mac&amp;Cheese was delicious, had a sharp cheese taste. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 5, 2012 Likes it Good Food by Rahket9 ( 18 reviews ) I read all of the great reviews so I had to stop by and try it today. The food was very good but a little pricey. Especially for the size of the tacos. The macaroni and cheese was delicious. Service was good. Take out took only about 12 minutes. I waited outside though because the music was very loud coming from the kitchen. I would definitely come back and try some other items on the menu. May 7, 2012 Likes it Food is good. Atmosphere? What atmosphere? by Naor Wallach ( 23 reviews ) Went there with a group of friends on a recent Thursday night. Have been told that service is slow, that the place is small, but that it&apos;s all made up to you in the food. I can tell you that everything that I was told was correct! One thing that confused us a bit was the address. The place is on the East side of Homestead - there is another building on the west side, but that does NOT house a restaurant (different story, but it took a police office to untangle that one!). Once we all found the place, parking was amply on the street and since it was past 5 PM we did not have to pay at the meters. The storefront is small with a single door entrance and sign at the bottom of the window spelling&quot;Smoke&quot;. Once inside, it&apos;s a functional space with a total of three or four tables and a bar where you can sit and wait for your takeout food.

Once inside, it&apos;s a functional space with a total of three or four tables and a bar where you can sit and wait for your takeout food. With six of us there, we combined two of the ables right by the staircase that leads upstairs - but is blocked off. Unfortunately the air conditioning was not working when we were there so the actual atmosphere got kind of hot and heavy over the course of the meal. The owner stopped by to apologize and told us that she is threatening to stop apying rent until it&apos;s fixed. It was a slight distraction though, not a real problem. Then again, the outside temp was NOT in the 90&apos;s either... The menu is small with two&quot;snacks&quot;seven or eight different kinds of soft shell tacos, and seven sides, with a few odds and ends and drinks on it as well. This place is a BYOB as no alcohol is served on the premises. There is a $2.50 charge for the glasses if you bring your on - which we did. It also only takes cash. As a group, we ended up ordering one of the snacks, and then each of us got one or two of the tacos, and we got each of the side dishes - with one exception (the chili-mac is a combination of their chili and their macaroni and cheese). This was more than enough food for the six males involved and we ended up with doggie bags. The snack that we ordered was corn chips with queso and this was the only disappointing part of the meal. The corn chips were a kind of Tostito and the Queso was very liquidy and relatively flavorless. The tacos were great! with the table have the gamut from the ribs, pulled pork, chicken, veggie, brisket, and philly-style, I was able to see them all. They are small, but the meats that filled them were very flavorful. in addition, each had added fillings that were flavorful and unique and very, very tasty! The six sides came in soup bowls and varied from pinto and black beans to a chili, to a cole slaw, and their signature macaroni and cheese. We all shared in these and therefore got a chance to try them all. All were tasty, although I must admit that I found the macaroni and cheese to not be as good as the reviews indicated. Again, it was somewhat runny and not very flavorful - but maybe my expectations were too high? Service is known to be slow here, but that appears to be a function of the kitchen more than any service staff fault. There was a server that took good care of us and the owner kept stopping by to see if we were doing OK. Since we were engaged in story telling and having a good time, it was not onerous. However, it did take almost two hours for us to get from collecting at the restaurant until we were paid and done. Overall, a good experience and really good food. We will definitely be going back. May 7, 2012 Likes it Excellent by AM ( 24 reviews ) Finally tried Smoke for lunch on Sunday and thought maybe I would be let down after all the great things I had heard, but it definitely did not disappoint! Everything was great from the freshly made fruit infused water, made fresh and different daily, this one was strawberry with a hint of lime and was the perfect flavor, not too sweet. The Frito Pie appetizer was a well balanced combo of chili, beans, cheese and avocado cream sauce. I got the veggie taco with avocado cream sauce on top, which I recommend, because it helps balance the heat. The little potatoes inside gave it a nice texture, although, I will warn that this taco had a little more heat than I expected, but it was really good. My husband got one Pork, which was a little less spicy than the veggie, and the rib, which was excellent. The meat was super tender, the sauce a great sweet/vinegary mix and I loved that it had pickles on it. We will definitely make the trip back to Homestead for Smoke. April 12, 2012 Likes it Easily one of my favorite new restaurants in Pittsburgh. by Nicole ( 13 reviews ) After reading others&apos; reviews I was worried about the service and wait, but my husband and I arrived at 5:00 PM on a Friday and we were immediately seated. Our food was served within 15 minutes! The prices are totally justified as well. Portions are very hearty, and everything here is made in-house including the smoked meats and tortillas. Both of the sides we ordered, the mac&amp;cheese with bacon and the jalepeno apple slaw, were amazing. The fresh strawberry infused water was the perfect compliment to our meal. I may never eat a regular Philly cheesesteak again after eating one in taco form. A must try! 3 out of 3 found this review helpful June 11, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Great food, bad/slow service by Not Mayor Luke ( 14 reviews ) It&apos;s indisputable that the food at Smoke is great. The meat tacos are stupendous (chorizo, chicken, pulled pork, rib), and my wife always gets the veggie tacos. The sides are also very, very good. But, at this point, my wife and I have a game going to see what&apos;ll go wrong with our order every time we go to Smoke; so far, every time we&apos;ve eaten there, some kind of mistake has been made. We&apos;ve had call-in orders where the number of tacos was botched (of course, we got less tacos than we paid for); we&apos;ve had the wrong kind of tacos packed; they&apos;ve been extremely late in fulfilling our orders (they usually say 20 minutes, one time in particular stands out when we had a napping baby with us, showed up at Smoke after 20 minutes, food wasn&apos;t ready, baby (of course) woke up and started crying, and it took another 40 minutes before the food came out); and they&apos;ve given me incorrect change a couple times. We&apos;re the fools though who keep coming back, because, again, the tacos are soooo good. Hopefully they learn their lesson before we learn ours. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful June 9, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Steve Scholnick ( 12 reviews ) The food is great; the service is great. The rib tacos are very tasty. We also tried the brisket tacos also great. June 18, 2012 Really likes it great aftertaste by mangia ( 3 reviews ) Brisket Taco -
found this place by accident while parking to go to a nearby beer bar. After checking it out, did not order, went to meet my gang at the beer place, and a few hours later, returning to my car, went in again, and ordered a taco to go. At home, chewed it slowly, it was really good. The after taste was awesome, that I didn&apos;t eat anything else for some time. btw, love the furniture inside the restaurant: it looks like a mixed bag of garage sale finds. May 12, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by maya ( 8 reviews ) Awesome, tasty food. Breakfast burrito was amazing. Veggie burrito definitely needs cheese or avocado added. May 13, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Benjamin Schupp ( 6 reviews ) Try the Mac and cheese! I had mine with bacon added and it was delicious. Just be prepared to wait for it. There isn&apos;t much seating here and you may have to wait for a table. We were sat at the &apos;bar&apos; facing the kitchen/register area and thus, whenever anyone working there came out, they had a direct line of sight to our progress and situation. However, it took an awful lot of time to get their attention for a drink refill. The wait staff was very friendly just not as attentive as you&apos;d expect with so few people seated. Bottom line, I&apos;d eat here again. June 16, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by BGentile ( 6 reviews ) I loved this place. Small with awesome staff, and the food was delicious. I started with the frito pie. Came with chili and an amazing sauce. Great for sharing. I then got a rib taco that had a really tastey porter saice. This was my favorite. I also got a chick taco with homemade apple bacon. I ended up ordering take out of their mac and cheese and coleslaw for my wife. It&apos;s BYOB wich is also nice. Gets crowded around 5 pm but worth it. I will be a regular!! June 2, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Jackie Marie ( 6 reviews ) Awesome tacos. Neat environment inside. Only a few tables which is disappointing since its byob. Fairly spicy so if ur in to that ull love it. The rib tacos r great. June 21, 2012 Likes it Surprised, pleasantly by CS ( 3 reviews ) Pork,Veggie,Chicken Taco -
Food: 5 out of 5 for sure. Great flavors, they didn&apos;t overwhelm with the ingredients, leaving you able to taste each ingredient. Staff: Very Friendly and helpful Price: Seemed a bit pricey for tacos, and they charged for everything...water, refills. Atmosphere: Atmosphere was really &apos;hip&apos; and casual, cool things to look at, and most importantly it was clean, but not enough seating, and the music was too loud. Pros: Great flavors. Cons: I felt &apos;nickel and dimed&apos; Overall: I would definitely go back, and would recommend it to others, but for me personally I&apos;d probably go for takeout only and drink a beer on my deck and enjoy! March 7, 2012 Likes it Fresh and delicious by Food Lover ( 18 reviews ) I have been craving good Mexican food since I tried Casa Rasta last week. I was in the Homestead area around lunch time and was not thrilled with any of my choices in the Waterfront complex and decided to run into Panera for a sandwich when I remembered reading some urban spoon reviews on Smoke and thought I remembered that it was in the area. I quickly looked it up and was there in five minutes. There were a number of people waiting in line and most people seemed to be ordering take out. After placing my order I took a seat at one of the three tables. This is not a fast food restaurant and the wait was a little longer than I anticipated for a taco and side of Mac and Chese. As soon as I opened the foil and saw my rib meat taco I knew it was worth waiting for. It was the best taco I have ever had. Mac and cheese was also great. Just wish the place was closer to my home. Highly recommended! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful June 29, 2012 Likes it A new favorite spot! by discerning_girl ( 1 review ) Wagyu Taco -
I&apos;m always looking for new and different food around the &apos;Burgh, and I do believe I&apos;ve found my new favorite spot! I ordered the Wagyu taco and mac&apos;n&apos;cheese. Order was done quick, reasonably priced, and most of all it was DELICIOUS! You can tell their food is made with care. Fresh ingredients, fabulous flavors...my goodness the brisket in my taco was sooo tender and delicous I wish I&apos;d gotten one for later too! Even the tortilla... it was incredible. The sauce was super tasy with a nice lil kick. The mac&apos;n&apos;cheese had a generous dask of pepper on top, which I appreciated. The cheeses...well...wow. Super tasty, covered the pasta well with a lovely consistency and flavor, plus the little I had leftover heated up very well ;) I will certainly be back... hopefully once a week if not more!lol June 16, 2012 Likes it HIPSTERS IN HOMESTEAD by rose wallace goldaline ( 5 reviews ) this place is exactly what homestead needed. food is beyond excellent. service couldnt be better and they dont overcharge!!! this might be the beginning of a new homestead. thank you owners for taking a gamble.

June 28, 2012 Likes it by Flame Fox ( 2 reviews ) Mac and Cheese -
I went to Smoke, and I immediately liked the decor. Simple, yet abundant with small items, knick knacks, signs, prickly plants. What was directly evident was the delicious smell of meat wafting through the air. My mouth was watering. As my drink, I ordered the raspberry lemonade, which came with pleasant mint leaves torn into it. I had two. What I had for lunch was the mac n cheese. I added beef to the recipe and waited patiently. And voila! A steaming bowl of mac and cheese, with good, fragrant cheese and soft noodles. The beef really added a little zest. The portions were filling, but not too much. I finished the entire bowl without feeling empty, or stuffed. Perfect! ~Flame
