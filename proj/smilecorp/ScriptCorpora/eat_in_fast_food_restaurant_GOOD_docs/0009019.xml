Description

No risk tryout for free! Photo Safe Pro by My Eyes Only™ is an iOS app that will protect your private photos from prying eyes. You Need this App If...


If...
-You have pictures you want to keep safe, secured with encryption and password protected
-You are a private person and don’t want your family photos viewed by strangers if they steal your iOS device
-You want to use your new iPhones to take close ups of all your credit cards and IDs
-You are a spy and want to take photos of secret documents
-You have compromising photos of your lover you don’t want published on the internet if you leave your phone at a fast food restaurant
-You have compromising photos of yourself you don’t want published on the internet if you leave your phone at a fast food restaurant
-You have photos that you don’t want your better half to see
-You have photos you don’t want your parents to see

!!! Encryption so Strong, it Needed U.S. Government Approval for Export !!!
All photos are stored using 256 bit encryption. Do your homework on this feature, most cheap photo keeper apps DON’T encrypt the photos. How safe is that? Answer, not safe at all. Are you serious about security, them encryption is necessary.

This is a Try-Before-You-Buy App so give it a try!
Try-Before-You-Buy means there are a limited number of photos you can add to this app before you need to upgrade. It allows 2 categories with 10 photos in each category. So give it a try and if you like it, use the In-App-Purchase to unlock unlimited photos and categories. If you don’t like it, then delete it. No big deal! We think this app, with its superior encryption and password protection, provides protection of your photos from real world threats.
