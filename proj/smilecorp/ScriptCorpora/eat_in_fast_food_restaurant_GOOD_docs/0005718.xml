Are you as big of a fan of Ziploc bags as we are? Here are the most creative and best uses for Ziploc bags and containers we’ve found. Read over all of the ideas and then let us know your favorite tip for Ziploc in the comments to win a Ziploc Variety Box full of Ziploc bags and containers!

1. Put all your spare keys in little Ziploc bags and label them so you don’t lose your head when you lose your keys!

2. Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords!

3. Store your travel toiletries in Ziploc quart-sized bags. I like to place each toiletry item in a smaller sandwich bag and then put all of those into the larger to avoid any messy spills from the airplane ride.

4. You can also place your jewlery in a ziploc. In fact, when I’m traveling, I put all my jewelery in a ziploc, important papers in another (like tickets), charging cords in another and so on and so forth. And you can re-use them every time you go on a trip!

5. Bring home your dirty clothes from travel or the gym in a large Ziploc.

6. Divide each weeks’worth of pills and vitamins among seven labeled Ziplocs.

7. Winter is coming! Do you have leaky boots? Put on warm socks, slip your feet into Ziploc’s storage bags and then slide on your boots.

8. Store your pasta in a Ziploc instead of a bowl (there’s something satisfying about this for sure).

9.  Divide spices for dinner tonight using several Ziplocs.

10. Store small toy pieces such as puzzles or legoes.

11. When it’s raining, bring along a larger Ziploc to store your wet umbrella in so you can still stash it in your purse.

12. Store maps, and all your important car information in a Ziploc in your glove box.

13. Marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready.

14. Store coffee beans in a quart size bag and label them by flavor.

15. When there’s a boo-boo, break out a Ziploc sandwich bag and fill it with ice.

16. Put the extra screws and manuals together from your furniture projects in one Ziploc.

17. Store small amounts of paint in Ziploc storage containers to do quick touch-ups.
18. Use large Ziplocs as impromptu diaper changing mats.

19. Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting–instant homemade pipe frosting tool!

20. Knead dough in a Ziploc bag so your fingers don’t get all sticky (though isn’t that half the fun?)

21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw.

22. Create a handy first aid kit with Ziploc storage containers filled with bandages, instant cold packs, etc.

23. To create a great mat to kneel or sit on in the garden, stuff a large Ziploc Big Bag with two inches of newspaper; then seal.

24. Cut up fresh fruit and place it in a Ziploc sandwich bag for a quick work snack.

25. Store greeting cards in Ziploc freezer bags by season and holiday for easy access.

26. Put your headphones in a Ziploc to avoid tangles at the gym.

27. Bring a Ziploc along for your camera when you go to the lake to keep it dry for photo-taking.

 liz 
My favorite tip is using them to store cards.
 Kimberly Russell 
I like the comment about spare keys because you label them and then you know what the key goes to
 Kim Gordon 
Although I have heard it is no longer recommended, the zip lock bag omelets are so easy to make!
 Tyla Strout 
I use Ziploc Bags to store all our arts and crafts supplies since most items like glitter, beads, etc. come in bags that are not recloseable. And I also use them to store my leftover yarn from knitting projects and then add that to the craft supplies. Anytime we have some extra time at home, we take out the Ziplocs and make new creations!
 Gumbo Steve 
Only way to keep gadgetopolis organized is to keep manuals, cords, spare parts stored in their own quart size Ziplock bag. Discovered this one holiday season and have used it ever since.
 Rita 
Store a roll of toilet paper in a Ziploc bag and put in my“float”bag. I also put most everything else (extra clothes, phone, money, ID, etc.) that I take on the canoe into Ziploc bags.
 Shawna Gurgul 
My favorite way to use ziplocs is to pipe frosting…fill the ziploc with frosting and snip a tiny corner off…then you can pipe decorative frosting or writing onto cookies or cakes, then throw away the mess!
 Sharon 
I empty my“Sunchips”into a large Ziploc bag so I don’t have to deal with the noise. I can wash it out and use it over and over.
 Lori 
Love packing my clothes for trips in the really large ziplocs. I just squoosh all the air out and ta da!- tons of room in my bag for other things.
 Jessie C. 
I like to use it to store crayons.
 Robert Nied 
I use them to store paint when I am working on my model railroad!
 sarah saucedo 
Store and send Box Tops for Education in them!!!
 Jackie 
I keep a handful of doggy treats in them in my purse. You never know when your dog or someone else’s will deserve a yummy treat!
 Katie 
I love using Ziploc bags for frosting (and fillings for eclairs and cream puffs!). I also use it for when I make deviled eggs–it’s so easy to put the yolk mixture back in the egg and I don’t have to worry about clean up, I just toss it in the garbage.
 Filam 
My favorite Ziploc tip is the first aid kit. Always useful on the road or camping!
 Crystal 
I use Ziploc snack size bags and fill them with three re-usable plastic ice cubes each. I store them in the freezer and grab them whenever I need one for a headache! When I’m done I just put them back for the next time.
 Jen S 
I can’t live with Ziploc bags–they’re the best. Besides using them to store meals in the freezer when I do bulk cooking, I put my Nook in one when at the lake or the beach to protect it from the water and sand. Perfect!
 Cheong Kim 
As a make-up bag. I hate digging around and this way I can see everything at once!
 Sherry 
I used them when I made baby food. I’d portion the meals out and just toss them in the freezer. Worked great!
 http://storiesareallwehave.tumblr.com Cat K. 
Best Ziploc tip ever: Omelets. Put your eggs, cheese, meat, veggies and spices into a quart-size freezer bag and squish to mix. Drop the sealed bag into a pot of boiling water and let cook for 13 minutes. When it’s done, pop your omelet out of the bag and onto your place. Voila! Quick, tasty, and mess-free breakfast.
 http://lifeisjustabowlofchicken.blogspot.com Ellen 
I keep extra buttons in a Ziploc bag in my sewing basket.
 Theresa 
I use‘em for everything, but #16 is a life saver—keeping extra parts and manuals together from any kind of home install project including furniture, overhead fans, air conditioners, etc. So handy.
 Marybeth 
I like to steam fresh corn on the cob by microwaving it in a gallon sized Ziploc bag with a little bit of water. Perfect every time!
 Katkerz 
I like to put sanitized baby bottle nipples in ziplocs, then into the diaper bag. I bought a pacifier/nipple holder, but still just use my ziplocs instead! Also love to marinate meat in refrigerator in larger ziploc bags.
 http://www.kjkcsoap.com Crystal Bruns 
I like to buy in bulk. I buy 20 pound bags of flour and use the Ziploc BIG BAGS
 http://Facebook Judy 
Shake and bake! Put flour, spices, etc in a ziplock, then drop your meat in and shake..this is great for me, since I tend to get flour everywhere without the bag..
 Sara Shinker 
Good for poopy diapers…keeping the scent in!
 Sue V. 
Love #7. With 4 kids, there is always one who gets snow in their boots and then neglects to tell me before they need to wear them again. Albeit not the perfect solution, but much better than wet feet at school.
 Chrissy 
I use Ziploc bags inside a small purse to carry my items when I go to an amusement park. I put my cell phone in one, my money/license in another and so on. This way, I can take my personal items with me on the water rides! They stay safe and dry.
 Amanda L. 
I store homemade cookie dough logs in Ziploc bags in the fridge, and then slice off dough and bake it for cookies fresh from the oven.
 Pamela M. 
I love Ziploc bags! I use them to hold everything. As far as my best tip, always have them on hand and when you bring lettuce home from the farmers market, place it in a Ziploc bag with a paper towel and invert the bag in the fridge. Lettuce will keep for weeks! Great giveaway, thanks for the opportunity.
 Ashley 
I want some of these… http://www.ziploc.com/Products/Pages/ContainersSmartSnapSeal.aspx?SizeName=Divided%20Rectangle 
I have seen them all over the internet for making kids super cute lunches!
 Deb U 
Children’s medications come in liquid form, and almost always tend to leak somehow. Once I open a medication bottle, I put it in a ziploc bag so my bathroom is clear from the leaks. When we’re ready to travel, I just grab the ziploc bags, and we’re ready to go.
 Jane 
My son was quite a puzzle fiend. I always put all the pieces in a ziploc bag and cut the picture off the front of the box and put inside the bag as well. I could toss dozens of puzzles into a bin and they’d all be organized and I didn’t have to worry about the boxes being demolished.
 kristen self 
my favorite way to use ziploc bags is to use the sandwich bags to sort my coupons…i write the category on the bag and then stick my coupons in…
 Beth 
I use the sandwich size bags to portion out my dog’s food for vacation. When the bag is empty, it’s used for a poop bag!
 Sharon Lambirth 
My favorite tip:

When I make chocolate chip cookie dough, I make an extra batch and freeze dough balls in ZipLoc freezer bags. Then when my teens are in the mood for cookies, they just have to take a dozen dough balls out, and bake them for 10 minutes! They always warn me when the dough balls are getting low!
 Rhonda 
I use the larger size Ziploc bags to store yarn for various projects. Just place the needed yarn in a bag and label it with the pattern name!
 Holly McCaddin 
#21 is a unique idea I would never have thought of on my own. I have never heard of making an omelet in one either. We can be so creative when we want to be.
 Yvonne 
I keep ziplock bags in my car!! You never know when you will need one. Not just for the kitchen .
 debbie 
i like to store little lego sets together w/ the manuals
 Cm chooey 
Slice a hot house or Japanese cucumber, add in half cup of sweet rice vinegar, put in a ziploc for an hour, tah dah, pickles!!!
 Terri 
I like the idea of putting the owners manual and the extra parts into a bag together. I also like the idea of the puzzle pieces.
 Chad 
My favorite use has to be 19. Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool!

Although now I can’t wait to use number 21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw. Considering how many things I ship with Ebay, this will come in handy!
 http://beetlewomen59@sbcglobal.net Judy Harrison 
When we travel I first wrap my hubby’s insuling in a paper towel then store it in Zip lock bag since I have to keep it cool at all times. I also use Zip lock bags to store the ties from bread, hoggie buns, etc. for future use, marinate and coat meats, store loose nails and screws, fill with water and freeze when we are expecting a Tropical storm or Hurricane.
 Tisha 
I like to keep a couple of large ziplocs in my diaperbag. If my 14-month old daughter has any accidents or leaks, I use them to store soiled clothes.
 Tammy 
I use a large Ziploc bag for first I’d supplies for my son’s football team, as I am the team nurse. Makes it real easy to just grab when I have to run out on the field for an injury.
 http://vickyandjen.com jen@vickyandjen.com 
I use Ziplocs to store manuals for appliances, electronics, etc. They always come with so many different papers of all different sizes. Label the bag and put them in your“manual”storage box. So much easier to find when you need them!
 Alice 
for garden produce–wonderful to see what is in the bag, date of harvest, and easy to reuse
 Bonnie 
I use the large gallon size Ziploc to store my son’s art work–either by project, camp, specific activity. I can write the date on the bag and see the contents easily and I know they are safe!
 Tammy E 
My fave use for Ziploc bags is to sort my coupons in.
 Michelle Barrand 
I turn a Ziploc bag (quart freezer or gallon freezer) inside out, put my hand in, and grab meat. Pull the bag around the meat to make right side out, squeeze all of the air out, zip shut, and freeze with no messy hands!
 Lisa M 
We used them for a birthday party art project. It seals so well, you put glitter, food coloring, water, and some oil. The kids love the way it all mixes together, like a lava lamp. Nice alternative to a loot bag.
 Kim 
My favorite Ziploc tip is # 2.

Ziploc bags are great for organizing all your electronic gizmos together.

I also like using Ziploc containers to sort&amp;hold foam stickers for art projects.
 Judith A 
I love all of these ideas and found a few new uses
 http://www.joyful-words.com Pamela 
I am a yarn and paper crafter, and use the jumbo Ziploc bags to collect usable paper scraps, store yarn, and tote knit/crochet projects (including patterns and notions). They’re just the right size, clear so I can see contents at a glance, and have carrying handles to boot!
 Calvin 
I use it to put cookies and cracker to take from the kitchen to the dining room and use the for my bus schedules so they get don’t get wet from rain and sweat. Thanks!!
 http://blogdayle.com Dayle Patronik 
My husband calls me the Ziploc Queen lol—from the time my son was little, I’ve used them for toys, baby items, snacks, etc in the diaper bag. I buy bulk and separate 50 lbs of rice into 8 gallon size bags for easy storage—freeze cleaned and cut corn on the cob, salsa, sauces, you name it! I also use the gallon size bags to store toiletries in when traveling or camping so bottles don’t leak.
 meeyeehere 
If you put big ziplock bags on your feet you look dumb,thats my tip.I put some on my feet one day and carried my shoes to work to keep them from getting muddy.People laughed at me,it was just like school.

 http://dayforfun.com Ches 
We love soup, so I make a lot and freeze them in ziplocks in the shape of a bowl so that I can pop them out of the freezer and into a bowl and I have homemade soup in minutes and exactly the right amount.
 http://www.monroefiles.blogspot.com Gabby O. 
I use the Ziplock bags to keep our phone chargers neat, clean and from getting into a huge tangled mess. Plus it is easy to travel with if I need to run out the door in a hurry and my phone battery is low, I can grab the bag and toss it in my purse and go!
 Charlotte 
I use pint freezer bags for freezer jam instead of containers.
 http://comcast.net Susan Robinson 
I used my Ziploc Bags when I visited my daughter! I put the items that“could”leak in my luggage. It is a great idea to keep the items from leaking on everything.
 Sonya 
I actually use many of these! I also use them to store game pieces in at school! They are great for center items where I can give each child their own“set”of items they need! I also use them to put books and CDs/tapes that go with the books together so the kids can pull out whatever they need.
 Teresa 
I use it to take my lunch and my breakfast cereal.
 Rebecca 
I use them to store buttons, and other craft supplies.
 abcegc 
When I travel, I use one bag for lingerie, one for socks, and one for toiletries.
 Maria 
I love using Ziploc bags for storing small toys.
 http://insanedaze.blogspot.com/ jennifer

 sara 
use a ziploc bag to hold all the small pieces while you are building something
 Renee Taylor 
Love to use for small craft pieces…beads, string, sequince…
 Bambi M 
When freezing food in ziplocs, don’t put them straight in the freezer or you end up with bag-shaped food. put the bags in an 8×8 tray so they’ll keep their shape and you get nice, stackable frozen things! Hubby calls them food blocks :)
 meg from KC 
i use ziploc bags to travel to make sure messes stay contained. no more spilled beauty products!
 Christine 
I make ready to pack portions with them to make lunches easy!
 Jeff C 
Use a ziploc bag to put in your swim bag to store all of your kids’wet clothes!
 Ashley 
I like to put graham crackers inside of a ziploc then seal, and use a rolling pin to crush them into crumbs. Mess free!
 Loreli 
I use Ziplocs to keep my crafting projects separate. All the components and the work in progress fit in one bag and stop everything getting muddled together!
 Kelly 
I love Ziploc bags for pre-portioning food. Since I cook only for myself, usually it would be cheaper to eat out. But with Ziploc bags, I can cook a meal and divide it up for several meals to come!
 Jennie 
we use ziplocs for keeping my older son’s tiny toy pieces contained and away from the baby!
 jane 
tip 21
 Colleen 
We use ziploc bags to store jigsaw puzzle pieces, so they don’t get lost!
 Claudia M. 
My favorite use for Ziploc bags is for the restaurant crayons my wonderful 4 year old daughter gets when we dine out as a family. It is a great thing to stash those crayons in my purse for the restaurants or places tat either do not supply them or run out and we happen to be out with more children. Love it!
 Alicia Webster 
My best tip is a variation on #7. When my kids were ages 4, 3, and 2, winter arrived hard and fast. The kids had their regular tennis shoes, but nothing to wear in the snow. So I put their shoes on, and then a large Ziploc bag over each foot, and then a rubber band (not too tight to cut off their circulation!) around each ankle. They played in the snow and had a great time, and when I removed the Ziplocs, their shoes were completely dry.
 http://www.abczoohome.com Amanda Fletcher 
I put a small amount of baby wipes in a quart-size Ziploc for my purse. Keeps them from drying out MUCH better than the travel-size dispensers.
 Laura 
I buy the extra extra large Ziploc bags (the ones that are supposed to hold sports equipment, etc.) to hold open bags of potting soil and charcoal. We keep these in a deck box on the patio and everything stays clean and dry.

We use gallon-size Ziploc bags to store product manuals/spare parts/warranties for household appliances (AC, mixer, etc.) The see-through bags make it easy to see what’s inside (place the manual facing out so you’ll remember what’s in the bag) and keep everything together and organized.
 Mandy 
I divide up my dogs’food by servings in ziploc bags when they are going to visit their aunt instead of traveling with us.
 Beth 
Like abcegc, when I travel, I sort everything into Ziplocks to keep my carry on bag organized. I put all electronics in one, all medications in another, all liquids in another, etc.
 http://www.thehappyclipper.blogspot.com T @ The Happy Clipper 
I use Ziploc bags to marinate meat.
 http://www.facebook.com/christy Christy 
I like to keep holiday items in zip lock bags. I keep cards in one, hooks for ornaments in one, garland in big ones, etc. I also use them in the bathroom to keep my hair accessories straight.
 Joanne 
I marinate my meats in Ziploc’s. No mess, nos fuss and very convienent.
 Deb 
I use Zip Lock bags to keep things organized and easy to find in my backpack while hiking.
 http://angiemarion.blogspot.com Angie 
I love the sealable containers that DON’T LEAK! they’re great to take food for potlucks or cookouts!
 http://www.mistywagner.blogspot.com Misty 
I use ziplocs for pretty much everything! My favorite tip though, would have to be freezer cooking…these bags save me, time and time again, by keeping bulk prepared food safe!
 Bonnie 
Use ziplock bags to freeze leftover sauces and soups. laying the bag flat to freeze allows for extra space in the freezer.
 Rachel 
I use Ziplock bag when I go to the beach or the lake. I put my camera, phone,&amp;chapstick in there to keep them all dry!!
 RBlack 
I use them for storing different over the counter medications. I have one labeled cold/allergy, another for bandages, another for stomach/heartburn, etc. This way when we only have one or two tablets left, I can keep everything together.
 Cricket 
I love to put individual servings of dog and cat food in Ziploc bags when we go out of town. Helps my mom or whoever is petsitting so much, because then no one has to measure out food–just dump it in the bowl and it’s ready!
 Cara Fisher 
I use gallon and quart bags for the wild berries I pick. They work great for smashing berries in order to process them when making jam.
 Lindsey 
I use ziploc bags for everything: from freezing individual size portions of soup to making up special treat bags for the kids on a long car ride. Just last week I used the large size ziploc to freeze apples from our apple tree.
 Marc Shendelman 
I use it as a pastry bag, for cakes or deviled eggs, just fill and cut the tip!
 Sarah M. 
I use ziplocs to carry wipes in my diaper bag for my kid. Does the trick!
 Darlene 
My favorite is blowing the bag up with a straw for bubble wrap. Ingenious!
 arbel 
As a dental student who is constantly in lab/library, my bag is filled with ziplocs which are used for storing food, artificial teeth, glossy photos, vitamins and….
 jeannie 
I use the ziplock gallon bags to make my marinade and flour coatings for my chicken and stews, I put all flavors I want in the bag (or flour and spices) then I ad my meat zip it and shake it and everything is perfectly coated or marinated w/o getting my hands dirty.
 Lindsey 
I use the ziploc containers to help organize my kitchen cabinets, flour, sugar, rice, beans, pasta etc. That way it all stays fresh and is easy to see an access!
 Leslie 
I use a ziploc for my nieces and nephews lil toys…easy to grab and very transportable!!
 Nikki 
My favorite tip is tip #2–Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords!

I use them to organize my sewing projects. All necessary materials for a project on my to-sew list go into their own Ziploc bag.

My favorite tip is #2. I’ve got a huge collection of audio cables, computer cables, video cables, power supplies–you name it. I recently spent a weekend sorting the mess out. Ziplock bags were a lifesaver.
 Stephanie 
I love separating my make-up into ziploc bags for different uses; i have going out, extreme going out daytime, special occasion, and casual baggies! keeps alllll my makeup organized!!
 Lynn 
My favorite use of Ziploc bags are for boating. I place our cell phones and wallets in a Ziploc to keep them safe from the water.
 Danielle Z 
I return cds to the library in them–so the discs don’t fall out in the book return.
 Patrick Richards 
My 3-year-old daughter likes to destroy board game boxes. We put the small pieces and instructions for each game in its own Ziploc bag and keep it with the board.
 Jacqualine Shorter 
I love ziploc bags to fill with deviled egg mix and fill the eggs perfect everytime!!
 Saundra 
I make 100 calorie snacks in each bag. So it keeps me from over eating by taking a bag when I need something badly!
 cheryl 
I use one to store ID and emergency cc&amp;money when I run. Keeps everything from getting sweaty!

I keep my wallet in a Ziplock bag on canoe trips.

When I am lucky enough to travel I use them for everything-toothbrushes, soap, food, vitamins. I even put a bunch of big ones in my suitcase-just in case!

I freeze my freshly made pesto in small zip locks.
 Rose 
We host a large Labor Day picnic for our family. I bought the extra large storage bags and store all of my picnic supplies in them. Everything stays clean and it is all right there when I need it.
 Alice 
I use Ziplock bags to keep receipts organized for expense reports when traveling on business.
 Charlene Roberson 
When I buy hamburger in large quantities, I cook all of it. Then I store 1 cup (about half pound) servings individually in sandwich bags, then put them all in a large ziploc to store in the freezer. Just pull out cooked meat for casseroles, salads, etc. I do the same thing with chicken breasts, either cooked or raw. Store them individually in a sandwich bag, then fill up a larger ziploc. That way I can take out only as many as I need at one time.
 Sarah 
I love using ziplocs for marinating meats…and I use one for bananas in the freezer when the starting turning. That way they are ready for banana bread and don’t get freezer burn.

I use the snack size to send cream cheese in my daughters lunch when see wants a bagel for lunch.
I use Ziploc bags for watermelon because they do not leek and my daughter wants watermelon everyday
 http://www.WildAppleDesign.com Jenn Paulson 
My favorite tip is DEFINITELY #13, the meat marinating idea.
I use a Ziploc bag often when marinating chicken with zesty Italian salad dressing.
Not only does squeezing the excess air out of the Ziploc bag allow the marinade to soak into the chicken better, clean-up is a snap!
The bonus of not having to worry about raw chicken juices, salmonella and cross-contamination on my countertops and utensils leaves me with peace of mind also.
Thanks Ziploc for making my zesty Italian chicken easy AND safe!
 derrick 
Use a ziplock to keep baby wipes moist when going out with infant.
 jennifer 
i like to put all my winter extras like hats, gloves and scarves in a big bag for easy storage and location
 Jocelyn 
I also use Ziplock bags when traveling but placing my jewelry and cosmetics in snack size&amp;sandwich size bags.
 Brittany 
I love to use Ziplocs to separate out my trinkets from traveling!
 Laine 
My kids take their snacks to school in Ziploc storage containers. They are sturdy and reusable, but I don’t have to worry too much if one doesn’t make it back home!!
 Robin 
I use the small ziploc bags to store heirloom seeds to use next planting season. Fantastic way to keep track and keep neat!
 Melissa O. 
I like to use Ziplocs when going to Amusement Parks that have water rides. I put my camera, phone and keys in one and them keep my money, credit card and ID in another. They slide perfectly into my purse. So even if my purse gets wet, my stuff inside doesn’t!
 http://djsdustyattic judyyy 
When I buy a bag of onions, I chop them all up, fill a snack size Zip Lock with one cup of chopped onions and then put all of the snack size bags into a bigger ZIp Lock bag and then I just get one out when I need a cup of onions. I also do this with celery. Saves a lot of time in the kitchen.
 Maggie Gudas 
I store my brown sugar in the Ziploc storage containers…My brown sugar stays soft and is ready to use when needed…All those I’ve told agree and do the same now!
 Erin 
Ziploc bags are the perfect way to store medicines! We categorize all of our first aid and medical supplies by bag, then pull them out quickly so we have all that we need at once.
 Allison C 
We love marinating veggies in ziploc bags. Our favorite are brussel sprouts—throw‘em in the bag, add some olive oil, salt and pepper and shake around to evenly coat each and every sprout—delicious!
 http://shovelingsandagainstthetide.blogspot.com/ Christine 
I cut fill a Ziploc with Deviled Egg filling, cut off one corner, and squeeze the bag to neatly fill Deviled Eggs. So easy!
 Lisa 
I use a Ziploc bag to make meatloaf. Instead of dirtying a bowl and getting the meat all over my hands, I mix all of the ingredients right in the bag, seal it, squish them all together to mix everything, open it up and press it (from the outside of the bag) right into the loaf pan! No mess!! Love it!!
 Shasta C 
I keep a damp washcloth in a Ziploc bag in my son’s diaper bag. It’s handy for unexpected messes.
 http://http.//alice.com Anne Brown 
I like to use the gallon Ziloc bags for coating chicken that I am going to fry. Put flour and seasoning in bag and shake. Drop in chicken whether you coat it or not with egg bath. Will adhere to chicken and come out a nice brown color when fried.
 ALIYA 
I put coupons into mine also but I use them for a variety of things….I shave down votive candles and put the shavings into ziploc bags. My daughter uses them to seperate the different types of Silly Bands that she owns. I use ziploc bags to hold my“dental pick and mirror”so it doesn’t touch any of the bathroom surfaces when not in use. I use ziplocs a lot in the car to store toilet seat covers, napkins, wipes, bandaids, etc. Ziploc bags have many uses for my household. I most often use them to seperate meat to go into the freezer.
 kourtney 
Best thing to put supplies in when you ship to soldiers overseas! Last deployment the ziploc bagged saved the whole box when something busted! :)

Favorite tip:
Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw.
 Julie 
Carrying small amounts of toiletries for travel!
 Lauren 
I have to buy a new box of each size of Ziplocs every time I travel because I do everything travel-related you list here. They’re great for separating, storing and transporting toiletries, jewelry, small electronics, hair accessories, carry-on odds and ends, and so much more. I also bring a stash for storing dirty clothes away from the clean ones in my suitcase, put each pair of shoes in a different gallon bag, and they’re great for isolating anything about to make a mess in a pinch!
 Joan Brinner 
I have entrusted a Ziploc bag to store a piece of my wedding cake in the freezer to enjoy with my husband on our first anniversary. I have teamed it with plastic wrap and another container, but am relying on the Ziploc reputation to protect it from the elements. Will it keep our cake fresh? Ask me 12 months from now!
 http://mymarkstore.com/slillie Stephenie 
I keep extra screws and nails in different baggies whenever I find them around the house or spares that come from furniture.
 Jennifer Wall 
I use the ziploc storage containers to freeze the fish my husband caught up at the lake. It is nice to have fresh fish in the winter months. I use the ziploc bags for storing items in when going out on the boat or just about anywhere. I love using them.
 Carolyn 
I like the cool idea #21 of making into a bubble wrap of sorts for packing packages by inflating with a straw…. genius!
 http://www.kerrileesmith.com Kerri 
I use the gallon bags to store flour. If I don’t have a plastic flour container, it’s much neater and (more fresh) to store the flour in a large ziplock. Right now my white whole wheat and cake flour are saved by Ziplock!
 Tiffany 
I buy fruits and snack items in bulk quantity. Once home I divide them up into single servings in Ziploc bags so that the members of my household always have healthy and serving size snack servings available at all times.
 Christie 
When I go away for a couple of days. Instead of taking small bottles of shampoo and conditioner I put the shampoo and conditioner in ziploc bags. Write which is which on each with a sharpie. When I’m done I can throw them away and that’s two last things I have to worry about taking home with me. I have done this for a week long vacation and it works every time.
 Diana 
I use the snack size for my cell and anothe for my wallet when I’m out in the garden-keeps it handy and visible, but not covered in dirt!
 Missy 
I have starting using the snack size ziploc bags for my new healthy way of living. They are the perfect size
for the portions my family and I need for healthy snacks and lunches.
 http://AOL jody tarrant 
I like to use ziplocks for so many things ,YET one that saves us money is to purchase larger sizes of our favorite snacks and use the bags for dividing up the goodies . This not only saves money it keeps portions under control! Thanks:)
 Becca 
I like to take a few large ziploc bags with us when we travel. They are great on a plane in your carry-on for all those little must haves for the kids. Also great to put a few in your suitcase for dirty, yucky kid shoes. Kids always seem to find the best muddy puddles and old gum to step in. This way you can still pack everything and not have to worry about the shoes making a mess on everything else!
 http://magenranae.blogspot.com Magen 
I definitely use them while traveling. There’s nothing worse than a bottle of shampoo spilling all over the inside of your luggage!
 Linda 
I freeze soup in them. They lay flat in my freezer and I can stick them in cracks and crevices in my freezer. Then put them in a bowl to defrost and you have yummy soup!
 http://thechildrensnook.net Angela P 
I love tip #17 Store small amounts of paint in Ziploc storage containers to do quick touch-ups. I am always having to haul up large cans or tubs of paint just for small fixes…great idea!
I also keep stamps in a ziploc bag because I have so many different types and they are easy to lose or misplace.
 Kara 
Instead of using the more expensive bags for storing and freezing breastmilk, I use quart-sized freezer Ziplocs (BPA free) to store 1 days worth of milk for my 4 month old son. I lay them flat in the freezer and can stack them up to save space. All I have to do is pull out one per day to defrost in the fridge.
 Sandra Rouse 
As a photographer, I use ziplocs to keep my memory cards safe and all in one place.

For outdoor concerts and sporting events, if the weather is overcast or rain is predicted, I will carry an empty ziploc in my pocket to protect my cellphone and all other pocket electronics when it rains. It also has saved my gameday ticket from getting soggy. Thank you Ziploc!
 Jessica 
We store baby wipes in them, we put meals that we’ve prepared ahead of time into them directly into the freezer, our son uses them as a pencil“case”for school, we put spare cords and cables into them, we put game pieces into them, and we use them to contain herbs we’ve clipped off from the garden.
 julee 
i used mine as planters for my seed-growing kit and plants. i poke a few holes in the bottom and put some soil and throw in a few seeds&amp;water&amp;voila! A high humidity starter plant kit for a fraction of the cost of what’s sold at big box stores.
 Jennifer 
My favorite use is to sort the hundreds of electrical, computer, and gaming cords we have. The bags are easy to label and makes finding the cord we need so much easier.
 susan 
I use them to package my own 100 calorie portions of snacks instead of buying the pre-packaged ($$) ones. I also put my iPod Touch in one when I’m out by the pool. I can still use it right through the bag, but it’s protected from splashes.
 Wendy 
I keep a Ziplock bag filled with spares of my favorite beauty products. This way when I make frequent trips I just throw it in my suitcase, happy that I have everything I need.
 Kathy 
# 21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw is my favorite!
 http://nancyritz.spaces.live.com Nancy Haas 
I have three favorite uses:

1) I put all of the instructions, manuals, warranties, and purchase receipts to each household item in a Ziploc bag so that they stay together and I can easily see and find the one I’m looking for. This is especially useful when I need to keep the information in the garage to be handy near yard equipment and power tools. Ziploc keeps them dry and clean. I can then put the page I want on top and refer to it while still in the bag. No more greasy manuals! Also great in the laundry room so there’s no accidental getting wet.

2) I sort photos in Ziplocs so I can see what they are and make the job of dividing up photos for family members much easier.

3) I make my own ice for use in the coolers when camping and traveling. Saves money when I don’t have to buy bags of ice. Ziploc bags keep the melting ice inside, which I can later use for drinking or cooking. When I return home, if there is still water in the bag, it goes back into the freezer for the next time.

I LOVE MY ZIPLOCS–both bags and containers.
 patricia zambrano 
I use Ziploc bags for vegetables, I am vegetarian and buy a lot of vegetables, and I used to throw a lot food away, now I wash everything cut up, and put it in the Ziploc not only they last longer and save money they are ready to use or eat! at a times moment. I know I have save at least $400.00 a year and no waste of food which I know is a big problem in this country.
 Rebecca 
I divide big bags of nuts and trail mix into snack size bags for my kids to be able to grab and go for a quick snack.
 Jack 
I like to use a ziploc as my wallet when I’m hiking. Keeps everything nice and dry. On second thought, I put just about everything in ziplocs while hiking, for that reason.
 Karri 
I live in NYC and have grade school kids. Taking multiple kids to school, I need to be hands free. So, I wear a backpack which has water, food, my handbook items, etc. I also keep a camera/camcorder on me at all times. So that the camera doesn’t get wet from a leaking bottle of water or condensation, I keep it in a ziplock gallon-size bag.
 Donna Geuder 
Zipliock bags, so many uses. My favorite is when I buy fresh fruit, like strawberries or blueberries, I clean the fruit and then place in quart bags and freeze. Take a bag ouit of the freezer when you want the fruit. I usually eat the whole bag of strawberries myself. Blueberries, take out what you want and put the rest back in the freezer for later.
 Joan 
I love to use them for marinating meat for grilling. I put small items I don’t want to lose in them as well.
 Brenda 
I use Zip Lock bags to keep my bondage rope organized by length.
 Greta 
I always take a few extra on vacation–-–great for shells pickedup at the beach!
 http://tj.dietderich.com TJ 
I make bento boxes for lunch, which requires small portions of lots of different foods. Ziploc bags are great for storing big batches of rice, grilled chicken, and veggies until it’s time to throw it all together every morning.
 http://Alice.com Michael McGeehan 
I have used Ziploc bags to separate coins for lunch money for my children. Also for storing cooked pasta until I need it.
 Helen 
I use Ziploc bags every day. So many uses. My favorite way to use them right now is to store my shampoo and conditioner bottles in my travel bag because I’m getting ready for a road trip.
 Michael Charter 
I use ziploc bags for all kinds of things.

In our Cub Scout Pack I was responsible for awards, patches&amp;pins. I would always sort out by recipient and put into snack size ziploc bags.

We also use them when camping for anything that might be damaged by moisture.

Whenever I need to get a prescription refilled but still have a couple pills left in the bottle, I put them in a ziploc snack-size bag and that keeps them safe till I get my new bottle!
 Melanie Sartain 
I use Ziploc bags to help me with my diet. Portion control is one of my biggest struggles, so I use Ziploc bags to divide up food items into proper portions that are easy to grab and go. This way, I always know I am eating the correct portions.
 Chris B 
I like to store extra bread or buns in Ziploc bags. The trick is to use a straw to remove all of the air inside without squishing the contents! Works like a charm!
 Allison 
I keep Ziplocs everywhere! Home, car, work, suitcase. I also keep a Sharpie with them so I can use them for everything at any time! Fantastic! I couldn’t live without my Ziplocs…
I also use Ziploc containers in my classroom to contain all of the small little pieces of games and such.
 Stephanie 
I put my cell phone in a little Ziploc when going to be the beach to keep sand out of it.
 Michelle 
While my husband and I are dieting I use Ziplocks to keep healthy snacks on hand and manage portion sizes. When I get home from the grocery store, foods are immediatly broken down into portions and stored in Ziplocks with the calorie and fat contents written on bag. It makes packing lunches a snap and when we are grabbing a snack it helps us make good choices about portion sizes and helps us see how many calories we are consuming.
 Sandra 
When traveling, I put anything that might leak in a ziploc bag.
 MarieS. 
I store my spice contaiers in zip lock bags when I leave my winter home for the summer. They are always still fresh when I return for the next winter.

I keep my coupons organized in my purse with the snack size bags!
 Carol Lee 
Even though my daughter got me all the beautiful Rubbermaid sets for Christmas and my birthday, I still use ziploc bags to put my leftovers in. This makes cleaning the fridge such a breeze. (Am I lazy, or what?) If I don’t recognize what’s in the bag, out it goes. Cleaning the fridge is a zip (pun intended). I also send everything for her lunch in ziploc bags, then she can just toss them out when she’s done. I hate messiness and losing pieces and parts to my sets. Ziploc bags helps me with this.
 Mara 
I use ziploc bags to divvy up all my Christmas goodies for everyone–some cookies in one, brownies in another…until I have made lots of little bags for each person, and then bring a huge ziploc bag full of all of them to work! Ziploc makes it easy.
 Johanna D 
I use my Ziploc bags to monogram cupcakes and cakes by cutting a small hole in one corner.
 Margo 
13. Marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready.

Is my favorite. It works with steak and vegetables too!
 louie 
ziploc bags are great for storing meat and marinating them. I marinate my meat and store it in the freezer. Defrost and cook!
 http://www.pennybugmom.com Kindra@PennyBug Mom 
I like the freezer kind since we like to buy a lot of fruit when it is on sale and then freeze it for smoothies!
 Andrea 
I work outside so I put important papers (schedule, emergency contact numbers, ect.) in ziplock bags. That way if I get caught in the rain those important items will stay dry.
 http://alice.com Barbara Betts 
I love the bags for when I travel. I placed my perfume and other liquids in them so they will not leak. The items are visible when I go to my luggage to use the products.
 melissa 
I use ziploc bags for my son’s jigsaw puzzles he is 4. I cut the picture off the puzzle box and assign it a number I then put that number on the back of each puzzle piece and put everything in a ziploc bag. This keeps all the pieces together, takes up less space then all the boxes and also provides my son with another way to figure things out.
 Kimberly Dull 
I use a Ziploc when I go to the amusement park to keep my things from getting wet on the water rides.
 Martin Mix 
Ziplock bags are great not only for lunches for me and the kids, but when we travel, we put all the shampoo, soap, toothpaste, medication, etc. in ziplock bags. No worries about wet clothes from the pool getting the medication wet or toothpaste leaking out onto the dinner clothes. If we use up the shampoo, we put all the spare change from the trip into a bag for the trip home so we don’t have to pick it out of the suitcase.
 Rebecca Scott 
I LOVE the tip about kneading dough in a ziploc!
 Laurel White 
I put all my garden produce in them to store in refrigerator. It lasts so much longer.
 Ronnie Porath 
I actually use Ziplock bags to make omelets. Get everyone lined up, put eggs in everyone’s ziplock, let them add their vegtables, zip them, and place them in boiling water until they are done. Everybody’s personalized omelet for breakfast and me not standing over a hot stove!!
 Kent 
Ziploc bags are great for keeping track of project leftovers.
 Anne Coldiron 
I travel a lot and always keep extra ziplocs in my suitcase: small ones for medicines, medium for snacks and cosmetics, large ones for laundry and to protect shoes/clothes.
 Pamela 
When we go backpacking, we use them to store our food/snacks and help keep the food smell from the bears! They also work great for keeping our keys and cell phone dry when kayaking.
 Tony DeCicco 
My favorite way to use them is to take them with me to the water parks and put the stuff in there that is not supposed to get wet (phone, money, band-aids for the kids!)
 Ken M. 
I love to marinate steaks or chicken in ziplocs. Once the meat and marinade are in, submerge the bag in a container full of water. This drives all of the air bubbles to the top, so you can squeeze them out before sealing it. Then all of the meat is in contact with the marinade!
 Deb 
We use the containers in the garage. Holds all those extra nuts and bolts, odds and ends.
 Renee 
I love using Ziploc bags for travel. There is nothing worse than finding shampoo all over everything! I use the bags for toiletry items and take extra to separate the dirty clothes on the return trip.
 Robin Arcement 
I like to make a big batch of breakfast burritos on Sunday and then bag them up in Ziploc bags and freeze. The during the week the kids and I each take a bagged burrito to school and work.
 Bil 
We always use then for our travels. Seperate the toiletries so they stay fresh and even when they get mashed up in the car they are still quite usable. Also keeps all of those odds and ends that you have to have for your trip very handy without having to dig through a purse or glove box.
 Mamawof6kids 
I use gallon size Ziploc Bags on our extended vacations. I put all our ligenie in, zip 3/4 closed, squeeze all the excess air out and finish closing. Once all the air is out it saves lots of room in the suitcase. We also wash our clothes before we return from vacation and what is left that needs washes we put in Ziploc Bags and just throw in the suitcase and it doesn’t come in contact with the clean ones. Saves time when we get home cause all we have to do is put the clean clothes away.
 http://www.savingwithbrandi.blogspot.com Brandi 
I use them for everything! We use them to carry snacks, lunches, cleaning out cat boxes, marinating meat and for packing to fly! We LOVE them.
 AsiaFan 
I use mine to store stinky diapers instead of spending an arm and a leg on a Diaper Genie, which sometimes doesn’t even lock out odors as well as Ziplocs do!
 Anthony 
I have a small TV in my kitchen over my sink. I put the remote control into a snack size zip lock so I can change the channel or volume without worrying about dropping it in the sink or getting it wet with my hands while cooking or cleaning dishes.
 Sandra 
Ziploc is still the best for keeping sandwiches fresh.
 Judi 
I use Ziploc gallon zipper bags for hostess packs for my Tupperware business. I put several catalogs, the outside order form and everything else they need for a successful party inside of a Ziploc. Then when their party is over they return anything that’s left to me so I can reuse it for another hostess. I also use them to store needlework projects. Each project gets its own bag.
 http://Alice Adam 
To contain the stink:

1) Babies stinky dirty diaper.

2) When walking the dog and cleaning up the poop, acts like a glove if you tunr it inside out on your hand…no mess or stink.

3) Personal hygiene for patients who have a colostomy bag. A Ziploc bag can save someone from a surprise embarrassing moment.
 Ada Miller 
1. I use ziploc bags to store dog food and treats when traveling.
2. I also store catnip for my kitty’s toys in a ziploc bag.
3. I use the snack sized bags for dollar bills when sorting the loose bills from the offering for deposit.
4. I store the paper plates for camping in a ziploc bag.
5. I put the small lanterns in the ziploc bag so the oil wouldn’t leak out the bottom and get all over the car for camping.
6. I keep a clean tooth brush in a ziploc bag in my purse.
 http://jennygslifeadventures.blogspot.com/ JennyG 
My favorite is using them to marinate meats! I just dump in my spices and oils and meat and it’s good to sit in the fridge. Then when it’s done marinating I toss the bag! I love anything that doesn’t involve washing more dishes!
 Shelley 
My 9 year old is at the age where she prepares her own school lunch. To make this easier for her (and myself) we divide up the chips and snacks into Ziplock baggies on Sundays and then she can just grab and go during the week. It helps her to be independent and it helps me as now she is taking over a task that was time consuming in the morning.
 http://Alice SusanR 
Since I work on lots of quilts at once, I store precut quilt pieces in Ziplock bags. They are easy to see and I write the size and quilt they belong with.
 Nancy 
I use Ziploc for marinades and for breading things. Since I’ve just moved and have no storage bowls, I’ve been using the baggies to keep our leftovers.

I put my toiletries in a baggie in order to keep things dry in my suitcase.
 Tina W 
I use Ziplocs to hold all the veggie snacks I put together on Sunday–I go to the farmer’s market, buy the veggies, come home and chop them up, and then put them in baggies for the week. Voila! Instant snacks.
 Phil Sevetson 
I use Ziploc bags to hold my earbuds and various wires that I use for cellphones and MP3 player and PC headphones. It keeps them from getting tangled with each other and I can pull out precisely the one I want!
 Ronnie Porath 
One more thing that I use them for. Put pancake batter in them, cut a small hole in one corner, and I can make heart shaped pancakes, spell out Happy Birthday in pancakes, etc. No need to buy all kinds of cookie cutters to make my little ones specialized pancakes!!!
 elina 
I think I’ve used all of the above at least a couple times, but I like to put my dog’s food and doggy treats in zip lock bags to take with me when we go on hikes.

I like the tip in #19–but I also use this idea for condiments when picnicing so the sandwiches don’t get mushy.

19. Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool!

I fill up Ziploc bags with Ice and use them in coolers when I go to the store to buy meats and frozen or cold items…that way if you have other places to go before going home you will keep your food cold and safe…
 Duke 
As membership director of an active organization, I collect applications and payments at events around the area and hold them until I can deliver them to our treasurer, who processes them. Since I smoke and he’s highly allergic, I store the cash and documents in a double Ziploc, peeling off the outer bag and handing over the inner.
 Samantha W 
I love bringing Ziplocs with me for my kids wet/dirty clothes, it’s a lifesaver when there is a diaper mess as well.
 Heather Leuci 
I keep two large Ziploc bags in the diaper bag. One for dirty diapers if we aren’t near a trash can and one for dirty clothes.

Check above 27 hints for grammar and punctuation.

Ziploc: Store those small leftovers of baking flavored chips and leftover dried fruit in Ziploc snack bags and keep those in gallon bags. Great for making“garbage cookies.”
 Megan Dobbins 
I use ziplocks for everything, storing dried herbs from my garden, freezing things from my garden, freezing single portions of family size packages of meats bought at the grocery store. Freezing leftover soups, stews, and anything else I coo. I use them to portion out laundry soap into single loads from a large box. I mput mail in them to put in the mailbox on a rainy day, etc etc.

My favorite thing to do with sandwhich size ziplock is to fill 3/4 full with either cooled soup or home made gravy, label and lie flat in the freezer to freeze. Once frozen it takes up very little space, for you can stack or stand them up straight and each is enough for two people!

I keep ziploc bags in my“fanny pack”that I use when we visit Amusent Parks, the Zoo or other outings. That way if we get caught in the rain, or want to ride a water ride, I put our phones, money and keys into the bags and keep them from getting wet!

We always use them for the“millions”of Barbie clothes and accessories that we have. The shoes go into one, the jewelry goes into one, etc. My girls know that to clean up, it is easy just to put them back into their correct Zip Lock bag!!

I love to use Ziplocks for a variety of reasons, from storing dried/fresh herbs, to using them for my dogs treats, to using them for cake decorating. They’re truly multifunctional items!

I use ziploc bags for partially used seasoning packets.

I put the 1 gallon freezer bag over my head when coloring my hair to develop my blonde haircolor more evenly! Try it, it works!
 Melissa 
I love to use Ziploc bags to store all the little pieces to my daughter’s toys. Barbies come with a lot of accessories these days!
 Jane 
When I’m out of the house and have other people checking on my dog, I like to leave a ziplock baggie of her food on the counter. That way I know she’s getting the correct amount of food and it’s easier for my friend to feed her :)

I use Ziploc bags to store my food in for camping–potato salad, coleslaw, BBQ Beef, etc. all go into gallon size Ziploc bags and into the cooler for lighter packing, and less dishes.

When traveling I any items that may leak inside Ziploc bags. You can never have to many ziploc products!!!!
 Isaac Eiland-Hall 
One of my favorite ways to save time while still cooking fresh and simple is to pre-cook meats and partially cook (i.e. blanch) veggies and portion out into Ziploc bags. I’ll put a pound of ground beef or a couple of diced, cooked chicken breasts in bags in the freezer–and that makes it a breeze, whether I’m cooking a dish from scratch or from a box like Hamburger Helper.

Another great thing to do is to take cooked and drained pasta, add a little butter so it doesn’t stick, then portion into Ziploc bags. For an insanely quick spaghetti dinner, I’ll take out a few meatballs and microwave in a bowl to thaw; then top with an aforementioned bag of spaghetti, some sauce, and shredded cheese–then microwave until warm.
 Andrea 
I use ziplocs to organize my drawer full of cables for various electronic devices. MP3 cables in one bag, cell phone cables in another.
 Jennifer D 
16. Put the extra screws and manuals together from your furniture projects in one Ziploc.
 Donna Kellagher 
When I am using my recipe book to perpare a dish, I turn to the page in the cookbook and put the book into a gallon size Zip-Lock.
I can easily read the recipe and I don’t get splatters and messy finger marks on the pages of my expensive book!
 Janet 
i keep all the pieces of my daughter’s toys and crafts organized with ziplocs!
 Betty Renner 
The snack bags make excellent goodie bags at Halloween time! I fill with individually wrapped‘penny candy’, put a piece of paper in with my name/address so the moms/dads will know where the candy came from!! Quick&amp;easy to hand out to all those trick or treaters!!
 Christina 
I use most of the tips listed, plus a ton more! We like to go away on day or weekend trips a lot, so I have 3 ziplocs in the bathroom cabinet that are ready to just grab and go whenever we need–one for first aid items, one with shampoos, soap, brushes, etc., and the last one I have our travel toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash. It saves the trouble of having to go to the store when someone forgets their toothbrush, deodorant, etc (as a family of 5 and one on the way, this used to happen all the time!)

I use ziploc bags to marinate my meat in the morning so it’s ready to throw in the oven when we get home from work.

I also use ziploc to store our flour, rice, and pancake mix in the pantry.

Oh, and one more: I buy the ready to cook biscuit rolls from the dairy section, cut them each in four pieces, fry them, then use a ziploc bag to coat them in powdered sugar–quick and easy zeppoles!
 Rachel 
I like to crush cookies or nuts inside of a ziploc…less mess and I can get the kids involved.
 Blair Greenwood 
I use ziplocks whenever I go traveling at higher altitudes, so my makeup or body wash doesn’t explode everywhere !
 http://www.alice.com Jessica 
I like having wet wipes in my purse and I like to buy large boxes of wet wipes, as I don’t like to pay more money for travel sizes of wet wipes. I then put about 8-10 wet wipes in a ziplock and put it in my purse and another ziplock in my car. You’d be surprised how often I use a wet wipe, even though my baby is 6!
 debbie 
I must do 90% of the the 27 ideas above and more with ziplock. It is hard to say which one is best, but I do use them to carry my vitamins when I am traveling. lighter and less bulk, plus it keeps them fresh and you can label the outside of the bag.

here’s another tip for using ziplock: when I travel to a country that uses a different curency, especially uses lots of coins, like the euro. I use the ziplock as my international wallet. The paper currency is often larger than a normal wallet and they use many more coins than we do in the US. ie. $2.00 Euro coin.
 Raynore J. 
I never relalized what a quality difference there is between Ziploc and store brand. I use Ziploc for everything now, especially things in my husband’s“grip”that need to stay organized.
 another sue 
Like lots of folks, I buy large quantities of ground beef and then divide it into smaller portions in Ziploc freezer bags. I“smush”them flat. They stack in the freezer better and thaw much faster.
 renee 
I keep extras in my diaper bag for storing dirty clothes, etc so nothing else gets messy. We also put pacis in small ones to keep them clean!
 http://acoustichigh.blog.me Stacey 
I travel by air alot. Not only for liquids, Ziploc comes in handy for CLOTHING ITMES as well. It saves space and double-protects from liquid stains!
 Caitlin 
I like to give the kids each a ziploc bag when we are on trips to collect their favorite things. Since I have boys, you never know what will end up on those bags. My youngest collects broken crab legs when we are in teh beach. Keeping them in the ziploc bag allows him to enjoy them for week when we return home without me having to endure the smell of dead sealife.

What CAN’T you do with Zip Lock bags? They are great for storing craft supplies. How about making your own single portion snacks…much cheaper that buy prepackaged! Wrap cleaned and sliced celery and carrots, in a paper towel, and place into the appropriate size Zip Lock bag. Place game pieces into Zip Lock Freezer bags. (Be sure to save the instructions.) Recycle the cardboard boxes that games come in. Place all of the bags of games into one plastic bin. This saves lots of room and make it easy to find and grab the game you want.
 Jen 
Sadly, I’ve drenched my phone more than once. I’ll fill a Ziploc with rice, and nestle my phone in it to dry. If I need to, I can carry the Ziploc around with me so the phone is accessible as soon as it’s working again!
 Carolyn Miller 
I use ziplock bags to store the warranty, owner manuel&amp;receipt for all of my major purchases so they each will have their own bag..makes its easier to find and store in a box
 Tiffany 
I use the ziploc double zip bags for carry around baby wipes in my purse–it is small and easy to throw into any bag and I never have to worry about them drying out in the bag.
 VIVIAN RIVERS 
There are so many ways to use zip lock baggies.
You can fill a baggie with water and put a penny in it and hang it outside your door to keep the flys and insects out of your house.
I also like the one were you can put a small amount of paint in one for touch up’s later.
 http://alice.com JEANNE CLARK 
I love ziploc bags. I use the sandwich bags for everything from, school lunches to putting small containers in for travel. They work well and do not fall apart easily like some generic ones. It is a very cost effective way to store and transport things. When done we either reuse or recycle them.
 Karen Luedy 
put ice in a ziploc bag when the kids get hurt and need an ice pack
 Rosie Ladeau 
I keep modeling clay in Ziploc bags to keep it from drying out so I can reuse it. Works like a charm!
 Mary A 
I like to use Ziploc bags for marinating meat. Once the meat is ready I can toss the bag with the marinade and don’t have to worry about cross-contamination. Thanks for the giveaway.
 Mary 
I like to use Ziploc freezer bags to freeze soup and sauces. Fill a freezer bag halfway with fresh made soup/sauce, seal and then lie flat. By freezing flat, it saves room in your freezer!
 Alison Sweeney 
I use Ziplock bags in a number of ways: Storage for buying bulk meats; The best way to marinade that meat is in a Ziplock Bag; Keeping the fruits and veggies that I will serve with the marinaded meat fresh; and finally, Keeping the leftovers fresh for lunch the next day! Ziplock, the only way to go!
 http://YAHOO WM BASNETT 
•Ideal for freezing fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, baked goods, cooked food, leftovers, and cheese.
•Microwaveable When defrosting&amp;reheating, open zipper one inch to vent. Caution: when using in microwave, place the bag on a microwave-safe dish. Handle with care. The bag and its contents may be hot. Do not overheat the contents as bag may melt.

MY WIFE PAM love’S the bags for when I travel. SHE placed her perfume and other liquids in them so they will not leak. The items are visible when I go to my luggage to use the products. and for security at the airports. I use them for everything
 Sandra 
I put nuts in a ziploc for my purse so I have a high protein snack if I am too busy to eat a meal.
 Paula 
I keep my small bottles of hand sanitizer in a snack size ziploc. That way, I don’t have to worry about it leaking in my purse (or backpack, diaper bag, etc).
 Joan Batten 
I use Ziplock bags to mix my deviled egg stuffing in the bag and then cut a corner to pipe into the egg white. I occassionally use a tip from my frosting set to make it a bit fancier. Place the tip into a corner of the Ziplock bag and snip off the corner so only a small opening allows the tip through. Then fill the bag with the egg filing and pipe into the prepared egg whites. Really easy to do and clean up is a breeze.
 Dana Wyrick 
I use the large freezer bags to protect my Amazon kindle so that I can read in the bathtub. I also use it for the ipad for the same reason. I even use the sandwich bags to protect my cell phone at the beach. I can talk on my phone without even taking it out of the bag.
 Pat 
I use the quart size to take a damp washcloth or two in the car on errand day–not only handy for cleanup, but also handy for cooling off on those over-the-top hot days; I dice onions, green peppers, etc. quick-freeze on a cookie sheet and divvy up recipe portions into freezer ziplocs for grab-n-cook convenience–plus they lay flat in the freezer and conserve space. If I’m going to be out and about at medicine time, I put those medications in a snack-size ziploc for my purse–easy to find and takes up very little room. I use them for corralling small loose items, packaging electronics w/cables for travel. I keep a small bag of kibble by my work computer (I work from home) for kitty when she comes for her snack. She thinks she’s getting a treat and I don’t have to leave my task at hand. I don’t like the packaging some snacks come in–it’s impossible to reseal–into a ziploc it goes!

I use them for EVERYTHING!
 JennyW 
When do I not use Ziploc storage bags? With three kids we store everything in bags. Tiny Lego pieces would be everywhere if not for in the Slide Loc Bags. We use them for school projects and to separate the spelling words and math flash cards. We use storage bags for craft projects for our Scout Pack/Troops. My husband takes them with him when he goes hunting/fishing to prepare his meats on the spot and not bring home the mess!
 kyla trammell 
When I travel, I put all my liquids in my suitcase in ziploc bags, just in case, the altitude may want to play tricks with my shampoo or conditioner.
 Jen Kunkel 
I use ziploc bags for freezing food, keeping fruits , vegetables and herbs fresh and as a pastry bag for making stuffed shells or icing a cake! I also use them for organizing and storing personal items and keeping things dry such as my camera or phone. They also come in handy for my canning supplies for this time of year!
 Kerry 
Love to use the large bags to marinate meat–keeps everything clean and all I need to do is through them away once done–no dishes to clean
 Sharel 
I store by boy’s toothbrushes in Ziploc bags to keep them clean between brushing :)
 Ashley Sarvis 
I used to use the gallon size Ziploc bags for storing and organizing frozen breastmilk. They worked perfectly. I could fit 10 of the small lansinoh breastmilk storage bags in one gallon size Ziploc. Then I numbered and dated the Ziploc for easier storage and use.
 Laura Kersey 
I use large ziploc bags for storing wet paint rolls. If I still have some painting left to do I just take the wet paint roll off and put it in the ziploc gallon storage bag and throw it in the freezer for use at a later date. When I’m ready to paint again I just take it out, let it thaw and start painting again! It saves you money and time.
 Brandi 
I put some corn starch, a little water, and a couple drops of food coloring in Ziploc bags. My kids can squish it around to mix the contents and then practice writing their letters and numbers on the bag with their fingers. They can“erase”and start over as many times as they need to.
 Sandra 
Ziploc bags are great for keeping jewelry sets together–necklace, earrings, bracelet, ring, etc.

I use Ziploc Bags to store everything from A to Z………from Alka Seltzers when traveling to Zippers in my sewing box!!!!!

I have used ziploc cbags to store my electronic items so that all of the cords stay with the correct item for at least 5 years now! It works out Great!
 lynn cook 
we live in Rhode Island so my husband loves to fish, and goes alot. he takes the big ziploc bags with him and after they slice up the fish on the boat they store them in the bags in the cooler until they get home
 Susan 
I use Ziplock to hold dog training treats. It keeps my pockets clean and allows me to carry an assortment of treats at the same time. I can pop them in the freezer between classes.
 Lisa F 
I freeze in season fruit, veggies from the garden, and fresh applesauce in appropriate size containers. I always know where our food came from and what is in it. All locally grown too. Use the big containers for the vegetables and the little ones to send fruit in school lunches. I wash the containers and store them away for the next season.
 Bridget 
I love Ziploc Bags of all sizes, but when we visit large amusement parks (aka Disney and Universal) I pack my diaper bag/backpack in Ziplocs. Every thing in the diaper bag is grouped into appropriate ziploc bags, so that when security pulls everything out it is easy to see what we have with us AND the diaper bag is not a mess and I can still find things when it is repacked!
 Sarah 
I use several sizes for backpacking. They’re perfect for pre-mixing food dehydrated at home (if you use freezer bags and an insulated pocket, you can just add hot water and avoid doing dishes!), keeping spare clothes clean, holding poison ivy-contaminated gear, keeping the first aid kit together, and all sorts of other things. You can even use one to set up a gravity-filtration system for your water.
 Jess Schaefer 
We use ziplocks for keeping baby snacks clean and separate from other family food
for holding baby wipes (no bulky wipes container and you don’t forget when it’s empty, since you can see!)
and for gift cards (especially good after big events like graduations or births!!) so that nothing gets lost and the whole bag can be tucked in another bag or purse when needed.
 Heather 
I buy hamburger meat in the large family-sized packages to save money, then divide it into the portion sizes I will need to prepare a meal. Each portion goes into its own ziploc, then all of the small ziplocs go into a gallon-sized ziploc in the freezer. I can pull out a single bag to thaw, or multiple bags if I’m making a large batch.
 http://none Ramona Grimsley 
In case of an“accident”I keep a clean pair of panties in a Ziploc bag in my purse:)
 Jill Klein 
I always keep a gallon Ziploc bag in my purse that is filled with gallon and quart Ziplocs! It’s amazing how often I can come through in a pinch and save the day with a Ziploc! I also keep a gallon bag tucked into the seat-back pockets where my kids sit in the car for when they feel sick. Thankfully we haven’t needed to actually put the Ziplocs to the test in this way, but it always makes the kids feel better to have a bag“just in case.”
 L. Stevens 
I like to use them for flour or bread crumbs when breading cutlets. It’s so easy to just put the meat in with the crumbs, shake it around, and they are all perfectly breaded and my hands and counters stay clean!
 Marlana 
I use Ziploc to hold a wet wash cloth for trips with the grandboys. It not only keeps them clean but refreshes Granny in the heat.
 Theresa 
I like to use the snack size bags for bandages, neosporine, and Q-tips and put them in my kids backpacks when they go on field trips for that extra security when I’m not with them. I soak a couple of cotton balls in Peroxide and place them in a separate bag so they don’t get the bandages wet and then put them all in one bag so its easier for the kids to find. If someone scrapes a knee or anything then they have everything they need to take care of it. The Teachers and other students know that they can always go to my kids for a bandage.
 Heather 
When we take our dogs camping with us, we put their food in meal-sized portions in ziploc containers nestled into an empty container. That way, we just unnestle them, fill the empty one with water, take the lid off the other, and we’re good to go!
 Sandra 
A ziploc snack bag keeps pens in my purse handy and keeps them from leaking all over.
 Anita Hanks 
You can use Ziploc snack bags to collect seeds from your garden. I like to get seeds from my melons and veggies to grow again the next year. Just label each one with a stick-on label saying what it is and what year. It’s great for flowers, too. Next year, free food and flowers!
 Cathy 
So many uses I can’t pick a favorite. I use them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Decorate cakes and cookies, craft projects and lots more. Anything that needs to stay clean and dry goes into a ziploc. Could not imagine a day going by without my ziplocs
 nicole harding 
I pound my chicken in them. Great stress reliever and no mess prep for dinner! :-)
 Carrie Welsh 
I use them to frost cakes. I cut a small piece of one of the corners and insert a frosting tip through the hole. I then fill the bag with frosting and seal the bag. The frosting can be squeezed through the tip to create whatever design I choose.
 Kelley 
We always take a ziploc gallon bag with us on vacation and keep our toothbrushes and paste in them so they don’t get mixed up with the other tolietries.
 Aimee 
I transfer frozen foods that come in non-resealable packaging to Ziploc freezer bags.
 Kathryn 
I fill a Ziploc with sour cream and then snip off a corner. Makes taco night easier and I don’t end up with refried beans in the sour cream container!
 K Evans 
I use gallon size Ziploc to keep my son’s small toys in. It is great for his army man collections, and his small plastic animals. They store well in the toy box so that everything is right where he needs it the next time he wants to play. It makes it easier for him to clean up his toys as well. Thanks Ziploc
 Adrienne 
I just used several gallon-sized Ziploc bags when moving house. I gathered the massive amount of pens lying around the house into one, used a couple more to pack up toiletries, and used a few in the kitchen, to enclose liquid good like oils and salsa before packing them. Our movers had told us not to pack any liquids, but we snuck these through without any leakage problems by using the bags–and saved the cost of restocking in our new house.
 Christy G. 
We use Ziplock bags for EVERYTHING!!!! My son is in preschool&amp;I pack an extra set of clothes for him inside a Ziplock bag with his name written on the front in black marker. I buy chicken in bulk and divide it up into Ziplock freezer bags. The kids have so many blocks and they all get stored into Ziplock bags. We just had an overnight getaway and their set swimsuits came back in Ziplock bags! I like having wet paper towels on hand while traveling. My daughter sucks her thumb and I don’t like to use any sort of hand cleaners on her (chemicals), so I generously wet some paper towels and stick them inside a Ziplock bag when traveling (keeps them nice&amp;moist!) so I can easily clean up messy hands&amp;mouths while on the road. I also like to pack my jewelry into a Ziplock bag while traveling. Keeps it all together and I don’t lose any of it! I guess there isn’t much I don’t use Ziplock bags for! :) I love them and they are a staple&amp;must have in this household!
 Grace 
I am known as the Ziploc girl and people always laugh about the number of Ziploc products I keep on hand in just about every size and shape.

I used the giant XL and XXL Ziploc bags when I was moving. I would roll up the contents of my closet and dresser into the XXL bags, and throw miscellaneous items into the XL bags. They are sturdy and durable, and instead of hefting a big awkward box, I could just grab the handles and go!

I am also a runner and I use a Ziploc to keep my cell phone from getting sweaty in my pocket.
 Tracey 
When I’m cooking and need to grease a pan, I use a Ziplock bag like a glove. I put my hand inside a Ziplock bag while I rub the butter or shortening in a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. When I’m done I can just throw the bag away, with no greasy mess!
 shannon 
My boyfriend always teases me, but I use the snack size ziplocs to put my iPod, earphones and charger in when I am traveling. It makes it easy to access and keeps my cords manageable.
 Juni 
I love the gallon zips for lingerie when travelling..just squeeze out all the air and you have a nice, space-saving package!

The jumbo size made great“lesson bags”for kids craft lessons for VBS, weekly/monthly Bible study, etc. One bag for each lesson holds all the necessary items for that days’craft.

Don’t know what I did before ZipLoc’s! True time and money savers!
 Michael Blessing 
Like #2 on your list, I use Ziplocs to store cords, instructions, CD, etc for electronics gear.
 Ron aD 
When traveling, I pack a washcloth in a Ziplock bag. Hotels in Europe often don’t provide washcloths, so I’ve always got one handy, and I can throw it wet into the Ziplock and into my luggage. I take it out when I get to my next destination to air out the cloth.
 Jeni Golomb 
I use the containers to bring food to friends’houses (like when I make meals for friends who have new babies). That way I don’t have to worry about getting my dishes back and wondering who has them.
 Tami 
If you need a plastic glove and you are all out of them…Ziplock Bags make a great substitue!
 Mary Williams 
I love to use Ziploc storage bags for just about anything. My all-time regular use is for when I am coating meats (fried chicken, pork chops, chicken livers, etc.) and vegetables (fried green tomatoes, cauliflower, mushrooms, okra) before frying. I just fill my bag with my favorite coating, seal and shake. It keeps your hands clean.
 Cynthia 
I use Ziplocs when traveling to store my cosmetics, tooth brush, etc.
 S. Ingram 
When my kids had just made the switch to big kid underpants, I always carried an extra set of clothes in a gallon ziplock in case of accidents. Clean clothes out, wet stuff in, and into the wash when we got home.

I love using Ziploc bags when I travel. I use the large-sized ones to keep bottles of shampoo, conditioner, etc…from leaking in my luggage.
 Lesley Bryant 
I use them when we go fishing.
 Kathy Ward 
My husband uses Ziploc bags to put his cell phone, licenses, and other valuables in to keep them from getting wet while he’s fishing.
 Pam 
I use large Ziploc bags for all my leftovers they are convenient, secure and space saving. I also use them to sort my craft supplies: Yarns, embroidery threads, beads etc. Space saving and sea through so contents a visible.
 Sandra 
I buy family size fresh meat trays for the discount, then separate them into meal portions in ziploc small freezer bags and put them all into a large freezer bag, then label them with the sell by date on the original package.
 Linda 
I think all the tips are great! I like several of them, the icing, extra parts/screws/manuals (I use this one), marinate meat (use this one too). I would have to say my favorite is marinating meat in the refrigerator. This is easy and very mess free and you can just toss the Ziploc when done and I am all about less to wash!
 Diane Hulsey 
I have 7 Grand Children, and always take them candy&amp;treats when I go to visit. Instead of buying them single packs of candy, I save money by buying larger bags&amp;use Ziplock bags to divide them up 7 ways. This way the kids get a variety,&amp;I save money. If we’re out somewhere I have the kids put the empty candy wrappers back into the Ziplock bags so the wrappers aren’t littering up the park or where ever we happen to be. The kids give the bags with the wrappers in it back to me, I empty them when I get home and have the bags to reuse for my next visit with them.
 Charles Clark 
I do a lot of Gold Prospecting, so use the quart size bags to hold my gold till i get home. I also use the gallon size bags to hold the small tools of my prospecting. Also the double lock on the bags insures that the bags holds my Gold without loosing any of the Gold!

we use ziploc bags for everything ~ but i especially like them for marinating meat = no spills! :-)
 Rachael 
1. Put a ziplock bag in a quart container. fold over top of container, add olive oil&amp;the rest of my marinade ingredients, zip it up, give it a shake&amp;add meat for a perfectly contained marinated meal.

2. Put ice in a ziplock before you put it in the cooler. Keeps things from getting soggy.

3. Put ice in a ziplock&amp;put it on a feverish forehead, a sprain, a bug bite or anywhere else you need to reduce swelling. Always put a towel between the bag of ice&amp;skin.
 Patricia 
My all-time favorite use for a ziploc is taking the little 8 oz. container of mushrooms purchased at the supermarket, carefully removing the plastic wrap so as not to disturb the contents, place two sheets (either folded at the perforation or stacked on on top of the other) of a thick, good-quality paper towel on top of the mushrooms, grab the corners around the bottom of the contain and flip over. Remove the container carefully so as to minimize disturbance of the mushrooms. Gather all four corners of the paper towels and put the resulting bundle into a gallon ziploc. A little gentle shaking to distribute the mushrooms along the bottom of the bag, making sure the mushrooms are still covered by the paper towel, roll up to expel the air and zip.

The paper towel absorbs excess moisture from the mushrooms. I’ve had my mushrooms keep at least two weeks prepping them this way. At the price of mushrooms, that savings adds up quickly.
 Christy 
Where to even begin? I marinate meat in them. I store crayons in them for car trips (they don’t fall apart like boxes do!) I frost cakes with them. I store shampoo in them when travelling. I buy bacon in bulk and then divide it up in smaller Ziploc bags to freeze it in smaller portions. And on and on!
 http://jerrysweetsucks.blogspot.com pam sweet 
My best tip and one I use all the time is to fill a ziploc gallon bag with frosting and snip one of the corners off. Instant piping bag!
 Kathleen 
I take my dog with me when I go to the shore on weekends. I put her food in a gallon Ziploc bag. Keeps it fresh and less bulky than a big Tupperware container.
 judy 
this one brings tears to my eyes…and maybe back then they weren’t called ziplock but, in the book“the things they carried”by tim o’brien, the lieutenant carried his“love letters”from his girlfriend in a plastic bag in the bottom of his pack he carried everywhere. it kept them from getting wet and rotting in the jungle heat and humidity of vietnam. this way, the plastic bag, held hope and love.
 Shirley 
I love this tip, I do it all the time: Store your travel toiletries in Ziploc quart-sized bags. I like to place each toiletry item in a smaller sandwich bag and then put all of those into the larger to avoid any messy spills from the airplane ride.

#25 Sorting greeting cards by Holidays. This is an awesome ideal. I am always buying and mailing cards to my family and I have them everywhere. Looks like me and ziploc have a date this weekend.

It all went very smooth Thanks ZIPLOC !! Linda Vaughn
 Lisa 
When traveling/vacationing with my toddler I like to put all of her outfits together (i.e. bottoms, top, undies, socks, etc) in one large gallon sized ziploc when packing. It keeps her entire outfit together. Neat and tidy in the suitcase and cnvenient for her to reach in a pull out her own choice of outfit for the day. In Disney….made mornings a snap!! Awake, dressed and out of the hotel for first crack at the rides!!!!!!
 http://dadmomkids@earthlink.net Nannette Chambers 
When traveling on vacation I put enough laundry soap into one gallon-size container for however many loads I will need to wash while staying in hotels; I put the dryer sheets in another ziploc. I LOVE Ziplocs:)
 Ali 
We use Ziploc bags, evolve, for just about everything. Leftovers, lunches, etc. Some of our more unique ways include storing small toy parts in them and taping them to the bottom of the toy so they don’t get lost. Extra buttons or little items around the house. When we travel, we put food items in them as they pack well in a suitcase! They work great in our garage for nails, screws, and odds and ends as well.
 Sandra 
I have a portable office in ziploc bags to keep everything I might need handy when on the road for work.
 kathy 
I store my bread in the freezer and keep just enough for the day in a Ziploc bag It taste great and so soft but I don’t have to worry about stale bread by the end of the week. Bread just toughens if you store it in the fridge
 Denise 
Put your food in a ziploc bag when putting it in a cooler. The food will not get wet and soggy if the ice melts. Ziploc bags are a must for camping!!!!

I make homemade‘frosty paws’for my dogs and store them in small ziplock containers in the freezer. SOOOOO much cheaper!
 A. Lawrence 
My husband and I always take a variety of Ziploc bags with us when we go backpacking. They are indispensable for packing in food/necessities and packing out trash and dirties. They’re also great for keeping the food smell to a minimum, discouraging bears from raiding our supplies. Ziploc is a Leave No Trace essential!!!
 Patricia Murphy 
Crayon boxes always break down and crayons are everywhere! I put crayons in ziploc bags to keep them neat and mess free.
 Birgitte 
I put plates of uneaten toddler food in a ziploc bag in the fridge so my son can eat it for his next meal. I also buy berries when they are on sale and freeze them in ziploc bags.

My fave tip from above is # 21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw.

I love using ziplock bags for an emergency first aid kit especially while I’m on the go or out bike riding so I can see what I have have and what I need to replace!
 Jana Nyhagen 
My newest use for a Ziploc baggie is to keep my son’s new cast clean while he’s eating! He broke his wrist on Labor Day, just a week after his 4th birthday. This is our best effort to keep the cast clean for the 4 weeks he’ll have it on, and so far, so good!

For everything–diapers (both clean and soiled), snacks, broken accessories waiting to be fixed, sand from a vacation trip, etc. Too many to list…

Ziplocs are perfect for organizing and storing my monthly receipts. Now they don’t mysteriously slip out from the file folders and end up missing just when I need to retrieve them.
 Julie Meadows 
I use Ziplocs for everything from toys to cake decorating. I store my cords in them. I put leaky items in them. I put craft items in them. I don’t have a favorite tip–I do them all. My question is“What can’t you do with Ziplocs??”
 amy 
Ever since I arrived in NYC with coffee grounds all over my clothes I used the 2 LB ziplock bags for travel. I iron my clothes, place them in the bag, ziplock it and then once I arrive my clothes are clean, AND I do not have to re-iron them. I can reuse the bags which is a bonus

I live in Florida..Hurricane country and have to be prepared for trouble every summer. Also lightning capital and always the threat of a sudden fire or falling tree, so I put my valuable papers, will, passport, birth certificate, some extra cash etc. in Ziplocs and tuck them in the freezer….They will stay dry in case of a disaster and the freezer is also, for the most part fireproof.
 Debbie 
I like tip # 19 the best….

I use ZipLoc bags for everything…. I am an avid gardener, so I use them constantly for seed collecting. I also use them for keeping paintbrushes from drying out, and I even use them in the kitchen!
 Beth 
We take ziploc bags to the beach to store the shells we collect and a ziploc container for some sand. Then when we get home, we make“sand globes”to give as gifts with the sand and shells. :)
 Tricia M. 
Ziplocs are used for everything around here–from storing food items at home, to snacks on the road, to little toy accessories–they always come in handy.
 John Aquino 
I love to take my fresh mango puree and mix in a blender with 1 cup cream + 1 cup sugar and fill a Ziploc bag- then rolling every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours of freezing to remove any water crystals. Once frozen, makes the BEST mango sorbet ever!!
 Jeff 
We have some individual serving size bowls we use to feed my 86 year old Mom. Some of the lids have been lost. If se cannot eat it all, we simply put the food still in the bowl in sandwich size Ziploc bags. It’s heat and serve the next time she wants it. It’s ready in an instant.
This has greatly reduced food costs in our home.
 Mike Vasiloff 
I use Ziplock freezer bags all the time to make ice packs. Its quick and easy…
3 cups of water
1 cup rubbing alcohol
1 Ziplock freezer bag.
The nice thing about this is you can make various sizes, to treat different injuries. If you want to get fancy, you can even add a bit of food coloring. The bags hold up great, and are much more fitting than a typical hard plastic gel pack. Whats even nicer is the cost…about $.50 invested versus $10-12 for one off the shelf.
 kathy 
I store the day’s planned bread use in a Ziploc so I can keep my bread in the freezer, otherwise, if I store it in the cupboard or fridge, it just gets tough. It really stays bakery fresh and I don’t wind up wasting bread in the long run
 http://n/a Yvette Latiolais 
I have a veg garden outside.. I chop up what I don’t use that day&amp;freeze them..That way they are fresh to cook for the winter time….Some good Cajun Gumbo…
 Jennifer Cleary 
As an avid seamtress, I have many projects to accomplish. Each one is put into a Ziploc bag of the appropriate size and then labeled and stacked in order of importance. I keeps all the notions, patterns and other supplies all together!
 amy 
My fave thing to do with them is reuse them. They are totally washable.
 Jeff 
Mom keeps a supply of straws in Ziploc bags in the car. She can have her nutrition drinks we she wants.
 http://bzzagent.com Malcolm 
I love the jumbo Ziploc bags–you can store clothes, blankets, gardening supplies and more. There’s nothing you can’t store in a Ziploc–so long as it doesn’t need to breathe! :-)
 Jen 
Ziplocs are great for storing veggies. Use them after you clean your fruits and veggies then stick them in the frig.
 Ollie 
Ziplocks bags are great for so many reasons! I keep ink pens in them at my desk. Easy to find whenever I need a pen! If one happens to leak, the mess is contained.
 barbara 
Put a Ziplock bag over your hand and use it to grease cake pans before baking or grill pan before grilling.Keeps butter and oil off of your hands.
 peg 
Have and OMELETTE PARTY!…
Have each guest write their name on a quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker.
Crack 2 eggs (large or extra-large) into the bag (not more than 2) and add about ¼ cup of milk (if desired ), then shake to combine them.
Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheese, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, hash browns, salsa, etc. Each guest adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake. Squeeze the air out of the bag and zip it up.
Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for 13 minutes to 15 minutes. You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot.
Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily.
 Dee 
When I go camping, I fill gallon-sized ziploc bags with ice from my freezer to put in my cooler. I not only save money by not having to buy bagged ice at the convenience store, but since I know the quality of the water is good, I have drinking water as it melts.
 Pattie 
I store all my dried beans&amp;rice together in 1 large jar by putting each variety in its own Ziploc bag, then throwing the bags in the jar. I can see what I have on hand without having to search thru several containers in my pantry.&amp;
 Cynthia S 
I use ziploc bags for dog biscuits. We buy a huge box that I break down into 5 or 6 gallon size bags to store them in (keep pests and other unwanted elements out) and I reuse the same bags over and over and they are labeled biscuits. Very economical all the way around.
 Venus M. 
I use them for everything from storage to marinading meat overnight. I also like to fill them with water and freeze them for our ice chest.
 http://www.etsy.com/shop/Cleverlilminx Wendy W 
My favorite tip for ziplock is the fact that both the bags and containers are perfect for freezer storage. I can go to the warehouse club to stock up on meats or cook a double batch of something like stew or chili, break things out into single servings and freeze in ziplock bags or containers!
 christine lewis 
when I’m out and about with my little ones I always make sure I have my handy dandy ziploc bag filled with crayons and mini colorimg books. One for each munchkin. It keeps them occupied while I’m out running errands. It’s really a life saver for me. I also love the ziploc storage containers that have three compartments in it. I use these to pack my husbands lunch for work.
 Sarah Unverferth 
I am a very organized person and Ziploc helps me be even more. I use them for everything…and I mean everything. The most recent handy Ziploc idea that i have done is individually bagging my breakfast bagels so i can just grab on out of the bagel bag already in a bag to take to work and pop in the toaster! i love this idea and it makes for easy getting in the morning when I am running late–always! I love Ziploc!
 Sharon 
My favorite tip is #13:“Marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready.”Thanks!
 http://MissMouthy.com Danielle 
My favorite use for ziplock bags is to store all the wires for my electronics. They can all start to look the same after a while! This keeps them contained!
 Jeanne Coffey 
I LOVE ziploc bags! I use them for so many things. I have many sets of wine charms for each season/holiday. I removed them from their boxes and stored them in tiny snack bags next to my wine glasses! Great storage and space saver. I also use a ziploc bag in my purse to carry receipts and coupons!
 Gwen Connolly 
I LOVE Ziplocks for everything! Leftovers are perfect to throw them in the night before and the my lunch is packed for the next day!
 Tasha Gurske 
I use Ziplock bags for everything! My favorite use for them is for screws. Whenever I take anything apart, I put the screws in Ziplock bags, label with a marker and duct tape to the item. I’ve never lost a screw this way!
 Cathy Mendelsohn 
This is a great tip: Create a handy first aid kit with Ziploc storage containers filled with bandages, instant cold packs, etc.
 http://www.ImagenieScienceAndMagic.com Lois 
Here’s a tip that will keep your lunch cold on a trip. Fold up old newspaper, put it into a zip lock bag. Add enough water to soak the newspaper. Zip the bag. Freeze. This frozen newspaper ice is called Pykrete. It was invented in WWII as a material to build unsinkable boats. It keeps food cold longer than blue ice. And if you have it in your freezer, it will help protect your food during a power outage.
 Nick 
Ziplocks are a great, handy tool for bringing lunch to work without making a mess!
 Aimee Siegler 
Wash, rinse and hang to dry, unless you used if for raw chicken! This allows you to have the convenience of Ziploc with a greener touch. This works best with the older style rather than the sliders, which seem to last through one or two washinging.
 http://ALICE Barbara Smith 
mY FAVORITE TIP IS TO USE ZIPLOCK BAGS FOR LEFTOVER FOOD TO SEND HOME WITH MY CHILDREN.tHAT WAY THERE IS NO WASTE AND i DO NOT HAVE TO HUNT FOR THOSE [ALWAYS]TOPS FOR THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS THAT ARE SOOOOOO EXPENSIVE
 http://danny6114.posterous.com/ danny6114 
I like using ZipLoc bags for marinating meats, for best results remove the air from the bag.
 Melanie Keogh 
I use ziplock bags to make supply packets in advance for art projects with groups of children. It saves a lot of time as opposed to distributing each supply needed for a project. The kids have everything they need so they can get started right away leaving less time for chaos :)
 Danielle 
I believe 13 is my favorite, there are a lot of them I like, but ever since I was little that’s how me and my mom used to marinate our meats ^^ so I believe that is my favorite
 http://www.pheobie.blogspot.com pheobie 
Great for looking at insects the 3year old collects without having to actually handle them! YIKES!
 http://anniehinton.tumblr.com annie 
I like to use Ziploc bags to frost cupcakes with. Fill up the bag and snip off the corner. Instant pastry bag!
 Cyn 
I use the zip loc bags for when I visit away from home overnight, or end up spending the night unexpectly somewhere, I use them to put my false teeth in, you add a little water, and you can add the cleaning tablet if you have it with you,
and put my teeth in, leaving air in the bag to protect the teeth, I know that is a little yukky thought, but it works, and I have nice clean teeth in the morning. LOL
I use the zip loc bags for everything mentioned in the comments and ones I read on the site, I freak out if I run out of zip loc bags. I store the weeks receipts in them with the pay check so I know where every time went, great for budgeting.labele week, and can find a receipt quickly , if need be, then you store the month of reciepts in a larger zip loc bag, label it w/ month, and file.
 Jess 
I like to use ziploc bags to store and freeze homemade tomato sauce. It is a great way to portion it out so that you have just enough for a quick meal.
 karin 
I use ziplock bags to trash old food, so it doesn’t stink and there are never maggots, and animals won’t smell and get into the trash outside.
 Jena 
I keep my circular knitting needles in ziplock bags, labeled by size. Makes them easy to find and tangle-free!
 Summer 
I give them to my teenage son to use for his model car parts, that way little pieces aren’t every where.

I keep spare batteries ziplocked in the refrigerator.
 http://www.sabreean.com Constance Reader 
I buy my meat fresh at the farmers market, and Ziploc bags are what enable me to do this. I can split the meat into individual portions, label the bag, zip it up and toss it in the freezer. When I need some, I can just reach into the freezer and easily find it. It also lets me by seasonal foods at the market, then freeze them safely for use when they are out of season.
 Melanie 
I put cake with frosting in a ziplock bag in my husbands lunch for 3 days in a row before he commented on how hard it was to eat cake out of a bag with a fork. One of his coworkers asked him why the cake was in a bag and he told him it was probably because I didn’t want to wash any dishes and he was right! Hahaha!
 Denise J. 
I use them to marinate meat. Just throw the meat on the grill and toss the Ziplog in the trash.
We always used them to store the game pieces from all the kids games. When we’ve blessed another family with the game they are always in awe that we have all the pieces.
 http://Alice beany53 
I use Zip Lock bags for everything from A-Z. I store all my left over food in tem. I don’t even use containers anymore. I freeze any leftovers, especially soup. When partially frozen, I get all the air out of the bag so that they can lay flat and take up less room in the freezer. I can’t think of a favorite tip, because I love them all!
 http://alice.com Rick A 
They make the best (and less messy as you can toss them when you are done) piping bags. I use them for icing, mashed potatoes to stuff the pototo skin for twice baked potatos. Ziploc products are one of the best items on the market!
 Leah 
I like to use ziplock bags to dispense icing onto cupcakes and cookies instead of a fancy pastry bag! I just snip a small hole in the bottom corner and squeeze it out.
 HARRY TISCH 
I like using ZipLoc bags for storing everything.
 tara 
I use ziplock bags to pre-portion dog food when we need to bring our dog (Bella) to the kennel. Then you can label with name and date to ensure she gets the right amount and has enough for her whole stay. We also put her chewable vitamins in the food portions to make sure she gets those too!
 http:www.doityarns.com Carol 
I put my latest travel crochet project in a Ziploc Bag complete with hook, pattern and stitch markers. Fits nicely in my tote and stays neat, clean and organized. It’s ready to pull out when I’m ready to stitch.
 Tami 
Use baffles to store leftover yarn so they don’t unravel and make a mess. Keys me see at a glance what yarn I have!
 Hector Martinez 
My wife uses large bags to organize all her kiddos schoolwork they don’t get wet or get dirty. Works great.
 http://nvanfleet@gmail.com Nancy 
I have a rod hung up on the wall in my craft room. It has little close pins that I hang ziploc bags from. I put things in that I use for my card making. Works great!
 Ellen Gold 
When I purchase items like flour&amp;bread crumbs, I replace the original packaging with a ziplock baggie and cut the label from the box or bag. It takes less space than the box, doesn’t leak like the bag, and stays fresher than the original packaging.
 Debbie 
When icing down beverages in a cooler, put the ice inside large Ziploc bags to keep drinks nice and cold without the mess of melting ice throughout the day. Makes it much easier to empty out the cooler too!
 Tara 
I use Ziploc bags to put Christmas ornaments in to keep them from getting scratched, broke, or stuck together during storage. My homemade ornaments from my kids are the most prized possessions and Ziploc bags keep them looking perfect even 10 years later! :-)
 Stephen 
I double bagged (just in case!) my iPhone in Ziploc quart sized bags while visiting a water park and it kept my iPhone dry and operational. Much less expensive than any“keep dry bag”you get at a camping store!
 Maria K 
Ziploc bags are very useful for travel. I like to place hair care and oral products in separate ziploc bags. It helps keep everything organized and prevents any potential leaks. The best part is that all items are visible and easily accessible.
 Phyllis Reinard 
I love Ziplock bags for everything in the house. I use the large ones to soak my stove grills in over night and in the morning just rinse and place back on the stove. Just put your burner grills in the bag, Pour household amonia over them, seal and let set until morning.
 Rochelle 
Learned the hard way last time I was on an airplane to bring a large ziploc to protect my under-the-seat handbag from a lemonade spilled by the child in the seat in front of me.
 Kay 
Ever make a batch of beans (like garbanzos for salads) and have half the batch go bad? I make fresh beans in the crock pot, then divide them into small Ziploc bags to store in the freezer. I take out one at the time and store in fridge for a few days. If any are left I simply return them to the freezer, take out when I need them and toss them in a bowl of water to thaw. It takes about ten minutes and I’ve never had beans go bad this way! Works for other easily perishable foods as well.
 http://melliemelo.blogspot.com/ Melanie G 
I use Ziploc bags every day! I store small toys in them to keep them organized, take along snacks for my kids, freeze left overs…it’s an endless list.
 Ashlee 
What a great article! My favorite use for ziploc bags is to store all those screws and bolts in. I also love using it for frosting.
 Van 
I use Ziploc Quart (freezer) to store ground beef in 1lb sizes. The flat storage makes defrosting very fast and easy plus, theyre just the right size for frying hamburgers.
 z. 
I use ziploc bags to divide bulk items, especially meat. I’ll buy a bulk package of meat and divide it into meal-sized portions, and then stack those in the freezer. Then when I want a chicken breast or a pound of ground beef, it’s right there waiting in a handy single portion.
 Rachel 
I’m a crafter. I use the Ziploc bags for storing similiar themed stickers, pens, buttons, everything. I like that I can punch a hole near the top and hang them up for easy finding later. I use the ziploc brand storage containers for my paints, clays, and more. If the container gets messy, I just clean it and reuse for another project. This is great for not yet finished projects when I need to clean up.
 Robbi 
My favorite tip for Ziploc bags is to bring a box of quart size bags to tailgate parties. You can store leftovers in them and they are great for stacking in the cooler to save room. You don’t have to worry about leaking either. With football season coming up, you can bet that I will stock up on these!

We use ziplocs, with the air squeezed out, to store our dehydrated veggies and fruits in the freezer. They don’t take up much room that way. :-)
 stacey 
I like ziplocs for storing anything I buy in bulk. I can separate into individual servings and pull out just what I need. With a busy schedule and kids going in different directions all the time it makes planning meals easy or they can each grab a portion if there is one or many. Allows me to save money by buying in bulk.

Ziplock saved my iphone!
My wife, son and I went on a excursion to the Okefenokee Swamp. We rented a canoe and I brought a ziplock bag to store my iphone, wallet, and keys -just in case. I sat in the back and soon my wanted to try his hand at paddling, so we decided to switch places in the middle of the swamp. Almost as soon as we stood up it became clear that standing was a bad idea. We both lost our balance with our first steps and flipped the canoe. We managed to all get back safely in the canoe, soaking wet and then we remembered- where’s the ziplock?! We looked around and there it was floating close to the shore. We paddled over, grabbed and opened the bag. All was dry! We were all sort of laughing about the whole thing when a kayaking pro, who had witnessed the whole incident and decked out in his full gear from some outdoors store, floated by and said,“you really shouldn’t stand in a canoe.”ha!
 http://doulos-theou.blogspot.com/ Jeff S. 
I use Ziploc bags all the time. From packing my lunch for work to storing the myriad of cables for all my electronic devices. The possibilities are endless.
 Tami 
My best tip–is When packing for a trip or for the diaper bag…use ziplocks to separate and sort items for easy retrieval and use. Like packing a few diapers, wipes and change of pants in 1 large zip lock, so no matter who changes the baby, it’s a grab and go idea. No lugging a full diaper bag in the change room.
 http://youllbehappy.com Ezra 
Put items that you are shipping in Ziploc bags even before you wrap them in bubble wrap. Or, if you’re not using bubble wrap but instead are using packing paper or sealed air packets, this advice is doubly important.
 http://Alice.com Veronica B. Phillips 
Ziploc is great both in the kitchen and out of the kitchen. In the kitchen, I will season my meats and put them in a Ziploc. I then pour my marinade into the bag, and turn to cover all of the meat. Great for storing left overs also. Outside of the kitchen, different sizes can be used to stored my husbands nails, nuts, and bolts, and screws. Then all of one size is organized together.
 http://www.savingssoiree.com Lynn @ Savings Soiree 
I use ziplock bags to use a pre-portioned snacks for the kiddos! I use them for food storage, but also to keep art supplies organized! There is no end for the number of uses for ziplock!! Love them!
 Linda Kay McFarland 
#2 is my favorite. i save all the accessories, cords, and instruction manuals with the date and place of purchase from each electronic device in a gallon zip lock bag, label and then everything is together.

Ziploc bags are my best friend. My favorite of the above is:

“5. Bring home your dirty clothes from travel or the gym in a large Ziploc.”

It’s what i do every single time i travel. Ziploc bags work especially well when i squeeze the air out. They enable me to have so much more room in my luggage!
 Lauren Loeffel 
Ziplock backs are life savers when it comes to my kids’stuff! I use them for crayons, my daughter’s Littlest Pet Shop characters, Barbie clothes, and play food!
 http://homeschoolknitmom.blogspot.com Shama Dawson 
I LOVE my Ziplocs!!! I’m an obsessive knitter. I use ziplocs to put yarn into while I’m knitting it to keep it clean and keep it from rolling around. You can either zip it almost all the way with just enough room to let your yarn slide out or you can cut a hole and feed the yarn through that way.
 Amy 
Ziplocs are great for picking up dog poop on a walk with my 2 year old. We can keep strolling and no smelly consequences after picking it up. :)
 Ryann 
I love the Ziploc Jumbo (2gal) sized bags when prepping for a BBQ. They seal tight and keep the air out when storing the rubbed or marinated meat in the fridge overnight. Last time I had a BBQ the brisket and racks of ribs fit perfectly in their respective bags. Jumbo bags are definitely a must have for the prep and the gallon sized bags are great for storing leftovers.

My favorite is tip #24 Cut up fresh fruit and place it in a Ziploc sandwich bag for a quick work snack. It is something I have been doing for awhile now and it really helps me get through the day.
 Amy 
…on a walk with my 2 year old daughter and our dog. Sorry! :)
 Pam 
We are a family of 4 and travel around the country a fair amount. Frequently, when we ship our luggage it gets caught in some awful weather while being transferred from plane to plane and often we pick up our luggage damp or even soaked by moisture, but everything inside is nice and dry because we use the really large ziploc bags to pack our clothes into first! This insures all our belonging are clean and safe when we reach our destination. Thanks Ziplocs for making life easier!
 http://alice.com stumpo84 
I use ziploc bags for everything from freezing meats to sorting nuts and bolts, but my favorite and funnest time is when we use the snack size bags filled with icing and decorate cupcakes!!!! The bags are just the right size to fit in the neighbor kids hands, so they can decorate their own Halloween treats.
 wanda brown 
when I have dinner guests and want to give them some food to take home with them, I use ziplock bags for all or any of the left overs I send with them. also for the left overs in the refrigerator.
 Janet Kaye 
I use ziploc bags for everything, although I admit the list of 25 has given me a couple new ideas! They are great. Amongst my many applications, I use several of them to organize the contents of my purse. This makes it much easier to find things&amp;to transfer them when I change purses.
 Karen Z 
To put your wallet and cell phones in when you go to an amuzement park. When you go on water rides those items won’t end up soaked like you do!
 Amy 
Storing craft supplies is a great use!
 Carrie 
I use Ziplock bags to mix my flour blends. I pour all the different ingredients into a labeled ziplock bag and seal it with some air in the top. Then I give it a good shake in all directions. The result is perfectly mixed flours/mixes and all I have to do is let out the air, reseal, and store.
 Amy 
I use them as icing bags.
 HOLLY NOGACZ 
I use Zips in the diaper bag. I make my own diaper cream. Snack size is perfect for travel.Even when it is empty I just turn it inside out and have one more use:)

I also love to use them as goody bags for Halloween.We don’t give candy here but little homemade crayons, glow sticks and erasers. The kids love them!

 Karolyn 
I love ziplocs! Besides using them in the kitchen, I use them for my son’s game pieces to keep them all together in the box. I use them for small pieces of hardward I find around the house so that if hubby needs to repair something he can usually find the piece that is missing.
 Jesse Englert 
I put my cell phone in a ziploc bag during bike rides to keep sweat and rain off it while it’s in my jersey pocket.
 Dorothy McCormick 
When I bring groceries home from the store, everything that comes in a box, goes into a Ziplock bag, before it goes into my pantry. You never know if one of the boxes of cereal or cake mix may have moth larva in it. Ziplock bags have kept them from getting into the other things, and saved me loads of money and food.
 http://Alice wanda brown 
when I have guest for dinner and I wish to send home food with them , I use ziplock bags, and for left overs in my refrigerator. very handy those ziplock bags for my lunches….
 Kari H. 
For organizing my DIAPER BAG.
I use (and re-use) different sizes and types of ziploc bags for holding dirty cloth diapers&amp;clothes, keeping mommy’s stuff (chapstick, breast pads, etc) together, and for housing my resuable wipes and bottom spray. I am loyal to the Ziploc brand because SC Johnson (who makes Ziploc) does not use BPA in any of their plastic products.
 Erin Truesdale 
My girls, 9&amp;11, LOVE using ziploc bags to organize all the tiny pieces for their favorite toys. We buy all sizes, from snack to gallon and clean up time is a cinch! Everything has a special place and the girls can see exactly what’s in each bag.
 Suzanne 
The ONLY way to make a cheesecake crust is in a ziploc bag…put the graham crackers in and smash‘em to perfection, no mess whatsoever! (I wonder what they did before ziploc was invented…)
 Dennis 
I put my wallet and cell phone in ziploc sandwich bags when I go boating and/or jet skiing to protect them if I accidentally get wet.
 Janet 
I keep small game pieces in them so they will not get lost or“accientally”dumped all over the floor when the game is being opened.
 Susan Manocha 
MY FAVORITE USE…. I have stored baby blankets and clothes…and important documents….
protects them from moisture and you can see through the bag and know if you need that item or not…

most unusual use–sticking disgusting meat garbage after cleaning a chicken into a ziploc. Seal it and it doesn’t stink up the garbage. Same idea for dirty diapers.

I could list a 100 ways that I have personally used ziplocs….

Toothbrushes for travel
important papers in your purse during travel so they dont get wet from water bottles or whatever
holding wet cloths or baby wipes
freezing water for lunch boxes
holding coins to bring to bank for coin sorter
picking up poop (hold inside out, pick up, reverse outside in, zip and no smell
same for diapers
same for food garbage that might stink your can (can also freeze such garbage till garbage day)
putting cell phone in ziploc for beach to protect from sand and also with air in it, it will float if you are standing or wading in the water and dont want to miss a call. (Put a towel in baggie to wipe your fingers so you can answer it)
extra keys in baggie tacked in secret location or buried for locked out family member
leftovers…. any leftovers…let them cool off first
holds legos for the car
holds medicine for the car
holds a change of clothes
etc etc etc

I keep a 3-ring binder of all the manuals to all my large and small appliances plus receipts and warranty information. I punch 3 holes down the side of a gallon size ziploc and put several in the binder to hold the paperwork for each item.
 Jenni 
I use ziploc bags as gloves to spread Crisco (shortening) on pans for cooking without making a mess. You can also turn them inside out and use as a glove to pick up your dogs mess, flip it back the right way and seal it so there is no smell.
 Beth 
I like the tip about using the Ziploc bag for piping icing and use that idea frequently.
 Jean 
I always have a supply of ziploc bags on hand, all sizes. I especially like to separate a large pot of chili into serving size portions in quart size ziploc bags and place in the freezer. My freezer is full of ziploc bags with various foods–shrimp, steak, chili, taco meat, etc., etc., etc.

We also use them when we travel. We took a road trip this summer and had to take along a box of ziploc baggies for leftovers from restaurants, snacks in the car, keeping a wash cloth wet for wash-ups, etc. We love them.
 Lizzie 
I use Ziploc bags when I pick blackberries. I fill up the bag and then when I am ready to eat the blackberries I rinse them by pouring water in the bag and then swish it around. I unzip part of the bag and let the water and debris out.
 Marilyn 
I always use ziploc bags for kids snacks in my purse. Also, I keep a wet washcloth in one for long car trips. If I keep that in my little cooler it makes a great wipe for hot days…..

I always take ziploc bags when I travel. You never know when you’ll need them. I keep all my maps in one bag so I always have them at hand.
 Judy 
Ziplocks are a great way to make cracker crumbs. Just put the crackers or stale bread into the bag and bang it with a rolling pin or can!
 colleen 
For young kids…Put a small amount of paint in the ziplock bag. With no extra air seal it up, then use it for small children to make“drawings”or practice writing letters/numbers. Easy to smooth out and start over, and mess free!
 Kendra Lewis 
I try to keep a few snack size bags in my purse for when my niece wants to get a treat from a gumball machine; this prevents sticky, messy hands or candy/gum covered with pocket lint. I also carry my artificial sweetener in a snack size bag so I don’t have a mess in my purse.

I use the large rectangular ziploc storage containers to store various flavors of homemade icecream in the freezer. They stack nicely and the 2 quarts of ice cream fits into this container with a little room to spare. Not that the ice cream is there for long. It disappears quickly!
 Jan 
Put frozen whatever in it for a small spot ice pack.
 Justine 
I use Ziplocs to store leftover food, so if it goes bad then I just throw it in the trash, no cleaning necessary! Honestly I could barely live without ziplocs!
 Ruth 
As a Kindergarten-First Grade teacher, Ziploc bags practically hold my classroom together! Puzzles live in quart-sized bags, dice and game pieces fit quite nicely into the snack sizes, Very Important Papers that will undoubtedly get mangled in students’backpacks are spared from an untimely death by gallon-size bags, my snack (cookies!) are kept safe in a sandwich-size bag…and that’s just to name a few uses!! Hmm…this might be a good counting lesson for next week: how many Ziploc bags are in our classroom?? :-)
 Rachelle 
I love Ziplocks because they help me organize my menus for the week…I’ll cut up a lb of fish from the market into individually-sized pieces and season, then I’ll put them in the bags (different ones for different seasonings of course) and freeze. When I get home from work I don’t need to worry about dinner–I just take one of these out to defrost and dinner can be ready in 30 minutes!
 Courtney Butler 
With a 20 month-old toddler, I use Ziploc containers and bags CONSTANTLY. Portioning snacks, organizing coupons (each“department”in it’s own bag plus one empty for coupons to be presented to the cashier), storing craft supplies…you name it, we’ve stored it in ziploc!
My favorite use for Ziploc containers is to portion out leftovers and freeze them. My husband works far away from home for two weeks at a time, and having home-cooked meals makes the time away a little more bearable. Since Ziploc is BPA free, I don’t have to worry about him microwaving in them. Also, being that they’re so affordable, if he doesn’t get around to washing them, he can just toss them!
 Sue 
I use Ziploc Bags for all sorts of things…too many to mention. My latest use was for collecting and grouping screws and nuts that have gone renegade after many in home projects.

Brine a bird
Have you heard?
It puts the moisture in

Bag the beans
It keeps them green
And makes your meal more fun

Freeze some sauce
And mark it well
It stacks with little space

Life gives lemons?
Keep the juice
And freeze for other use

Sow some seeds
And keep them safe
Your garden grows in bounty

But most of all
I have it all
Cause Ziplock keeps it neat

I am a hobby jewelery maker and Zip Lock bags are invaluable for storing and organizing loose gemstones, findings, wire, tools, beads, and finished jewelery pieces. I think that I utilize every size that Zip Lock makes! I also store a lot of my own jewelry in them because it helps to keep the silver pieces from tarnishing because air can’t get to them! Storing them in this manner also keeps them clean and free of dust.
 HOLLY NOGACZ 
I forgot to say I use them to save money. Not they way you may think. I put my credit cards in a Zip and then freeze them in a bowl of water. No more thoughtless purchases. I have to wait for the cards to thaw out of the ice block before I can use them:) Gives me time to think if I REALLY want the item:)
 MAP 
Ziplocs = versatile&amp;universal solution to so many many things….I LOVE’em!! My favorite use is for travel. As others have mentioned, to keep clothing&amp;gear safe and DRY.
 Meredith 
If I’m out with my son and he gets messy, I like storing dirty clothes in a ziploc bag until I have the chance to bring them home and wash them.
 Dana Evans 
I buy ripe bananas in bulk when they are marked down for quick sale @ the store, bring them home, peel them and store them in the freezer in the gallon size Ziplock freezer bags. I use them to make fruit smoothies and banana bread. With my Ziplock freezer bags, I always have plenty of bananas on hand!
 Julie D. 
Even though there is just my husband and myself I still buy family size packages of meat because they are less expensive and use the ziploc bags to divide the meat into smaller portions.
 Anne 
Ziploc containers rock! Especialy good when freezing items to eliminate freezer burns. I always put my meat in a ziploc in additon to store packaging and have no problem with burning! Containers are good for freezing leftovers which I have found are a good size to bring to my Mom who is older and does not cook so much anymore.
 Rachel A. 
We love to use Ziploc bags for frosting birthday cakes!
 Miriam J. 
I’m a big fan of Ziplock containers. I keep a variety of them on hand so that when one of my friends or relatives is under the weather, I can easily tote over soups, dinner, desserts, snacks for kiddos, or whatever else they need, and then they don’t have to worry about returning my dishes!
 Velda 
I carry a gallon size Ziploc bag in the carry bag on my bicycle. If it happens to start raining while I am riding and I have to stop for any reason and leave my bike outdoors, the Ziploc bag keeps my gel seat dry.
 Cheryl 
Love Ziplocs!!!!!!!!! Have tried other brands but have always been disappointed and come running back…….I literally use them for everything, from lunches to organizing things in every room in the house. The latest way I have utilized them is to put a mini sticky roller lint brush in one so I can put it in my purse:-)
 Patti Sherburne 
I love Ziplocs, I use them for many, many things. They are so handy! I use them for food storage, bottle top storage, extra nuts and bolts for the house, What I really like doing is cutting out the top lid of puzzles (for the picture) and putting the puzzle pieces into the ziploc. my kids don’t destroy the box that way, and all the puzzle pieces are together then. I also give some to my 11 year old, who is obsessed with Lego&amp;Bionicle sets. He keeps the extra pieces to each set in a separate ziploc bag, with the book to that particular set. I keep extra needles and yarn with me in the snack size baggie, for just in case clothes repair, and also a set with a sunglass/eyeglass repair kit when traveling. We have so many uses for them, I have to keep at least 2 boxes of each size on hand! I’m addicted! Thank you Ziploc, for keeping my house organized!
 Rebecca Baker 
#13 marinating the meat. Ziploc bags make this SO much easier (and as a working mom, I am all about easy!)
 Bonita 
I use ziplock bags to provide easy to see storage of items in my purse; pens, makeup, first-aid items, keys, and of course those snacks for the kids. To make the bags easier to sort you can put some fingernail polish on the outside top corners to make them color coded for easier accessibility.
 shawn’l 
LOVE , LOVE, LOVE ZIPLOC bags and storage containers. What can’t you put in them is more the question. SO many uses. I have already done everything on the list above except the umbrella idea. Would have been nice when I lived in WA state. I live in Sunny Southern Utah now so not much need any more.
 marsha seefried 
I used these ideas for years as a teacher and now as a grandma I’m passing it on. Ziplocks are great for controlling the“mess”. Individual games, puzzles that have lost their boxes, crayons, markers, pencils ect. with no boxes all fit into desks to help organization skills.
My favorite idea for at home and school is to put a book and a tape or CD in a ziplock bag . I put these in a plastic bin next to my player with headphones so the children (grandchildren) can easily access everything they need to hear a favorite story. It is so popular that when I give this kind of gift I start out with the book, cd or tape in ziplocks. No more tears, endless looking, broken or lost items.
 http://www.lyndseypase.com Lyndsey Pase 
We label ziplock bags“Bag Bag,”to put out opened freezer products in to prevent freezer burn, and reuse them over and over again. I also store bath products in them when traveling so they don’t leak onto any clothes.
 http://www.alice.com Cindy 
I use ziploc’s for almost everything!! Put sunscreen in the 1/2 gallon ziploc–to keep pool towels clean and free of sticky, oily, sunscreen.
 Lavone 
Once I open my bag of ground coffee, I pour the whole thing into a Ziploc container to keep it fresh. I was finding that leaving the coffee in the bag it came in was not keeping it fresh. Also, it’s way more convenient to scoop coffee from a Ziploc container than a deep coffee bag or tin. Thanks Ziploc!
 Bunny 
I use lots of Ziplocs of all sorts when camping to keep things organized and dry but my best tip of all is to put a spare outfit of clothes in a giant Ziploc and leave it in the car. This way, no matter how dirty, wet, smokey, or stinky I get from camping, I’ve got something clean and dry for the drive home!
 Wendy Johnson 
We traveled by cruise ship through the Panama Canal and worried about our camera with regard to condensation going from an air conditioned cabin to outside temperatures of 100 degrees and above with very high humidity. The night before, we stored our camera in a Ziplock, expelling as much air as possible. In the morning we set the Ziplock with the camera out on our balcony to warm up. There was no condensation on the camera and the pictures turned out wonderful!
 http://alice.com Susie Herges 
I put little“love notes”and“Have a fabulous day or Good luck on your big test, etc…”notes in a ziploc bag with my children’s lunches. It gives them an instant puck-me-up and a smile in their heart. It also gives them a bag to put any left-overs in from lunch if they want to save them for later or bring them home. Ziploc bags are made with love and great for sharing love. Thanks Ziploc!
 Deb Spaulding 
In order not to waste garden zucchinis that get too large, I cut them into large pieces (including the rind)
grate up 1 1/2 cup portions and put them into ziplock bags. I store them flat in the freezer (space saving!) and later pull out what I need for making zucchini bread all through the year!
 Melanie 
I live on ziplock bags, and have many uses, but thought these are a couple I can’t do without and didn’t see mentioned, so might help someone else out.

I keep a few in the car and if a child gets sick and we can’t pull over, we hand them one of those, zip it shut and throw it away the very next chance we can. Keeps the smell in, and has never leaked.

The other thing is a couple of small ones in a diaper bag for dirty clothes, or for a dirty diaper when I’m in a place I can’t get to a trash can for a few.
 Rob 
I use Ziploc bags mostly to store non-food items: like spare parts and manuals (16); proof of insurance and registration for the car (12); and, of course, a quart bag for carry-on toiletries when flying (3).
 Amanda 
We recently moved to a new state and I used ziplock bags for everything! Nuts and bolts from furniture, small toys like pet shops and legos that would get lost in boxes, anything that could leak from its original container was placed in a ziplock as well to protect other items in the box. Everything made it safe and organized! It was so easy to grab each bag of hardware to put together the beds and other small furniture and find all of the TV remotes! :)
 Linda Jeffrey 
I took a plane trip for the first time in twenty years this past summer, and I was astounded at how many uses they have while away from home. Not only did my toiletries go in a Ziploc for the plane, I used another to keep my electronic gadgets together and ready for airport inspection. Once at my destination, I used a Ziploc to keep a snack handy in my purse, and when it came time to visit the laundomat, I had powdered detergent ready to go–in a Ziploc, of course.
 Heather 
We use Ziplocs for lots of different things, like most households, it seems. But we save the used ones that aren’t too icky and save them for use in the van. We have a 4 and 6 year old so we are always looking for something to dispose the remains of a messy snack. This way, there is no mess and no smell, either. We live in Florida and if we can’t get to a trash receptical quickly, things can get smelly. Reusing our favorite storage item not only keeps us clean–it helps us reduce the amount of trash we make because we try to reuse our items as much as possible.

Small Ziplock bags are great for making deviled eggs. Just put the yolks, mayo, seasonings in the bag, close and mash together until well combined. Cut off a small portion of one corner and pipe the mixture into the egg whites.
 Cassandra 
When I buy bread from the bakery, we eat part of it on the first night. But to keep it fresh for the rest of the week, i store the bread in a large ziploc bag.
 Suzann W 
Using ziploc bags are a daily thing for us. We use them for lunches, to freeze food, to organize crafts&amp;my daughters crayons and pencils, for makeup…We love all the ziploc products!!!
 Jennifer Sylvester 
I could not function without Ziploc. We divide out bulk snacks for the kids for grab and go lunches. Place toiletries in big bags to prevent spillage when traveling. Keep a couple in backpacks in case of wet clothes. We even use the JUMBO bags for extra linen storage.
 Laura Zinke 
Oh Ziploc, let us tell you how we Love thee….
You keep all my Beads from falling on the floor, lil tiny toys haha dont get lost anymore, the puzzle pieces stay together so nice and barbie can find her cloths so much easier than before.
Rubber bands are so ease to find with your help. Mix peanut butter and jelly together in a zippy bag so their is no soggy bread at lunch, fill a zippy with some nuts and raisins and head out the door ..
I also love to drop my recipe card in a zippy as I bake to help keep them clean…..
Their is no end to what a Ziploc can do.
 Linda 
I have used Ziplocs for just about ALL of these tips mentioned so it’s hard to choose a favorite. Here’s a use for them that I don’t think has been mentioned yet: You can SEW THEM TOGETHER and make busy books and emergency kits! Just take a pot holder to use as a cover and sew a dozen or so ziplocs (across the bottom edge of the ziplocs) to the center of the pot holder. For a busy book, fill each bag with different items: crayons, a small pad of paper and a pencil, tiny toys, a hand full of legos, a few sheets of stickers, some colorful paper clips for linking together, some small treats or crackers to eat, mini books, etc. The possibilities are endless! For emergency kits, think outside the box: emergencies aren’t always medical! You can fill the ziplocs with items like this: safety pins, feminine supplies, tylenol, band-aids, pen and notepad, a garbage bag folded really small (use as a rain poncho, etc.), a small sewing kit, some string, breath mints, sample packets of lotion or handsanitizer, a couple of babywipes, ETC! Fold the potholder around the filled ziplocs and secure with a button or some ribbon. I LOVE ZIPLOCS!
 C. Loh 
In addition to food preparation and food storage, I found it easy and convenient to use Ziploc Bags for temporary storage for loose pieces of important papers like receipts, business cards, notes,…etc. for drawers, purses, or laptop computer carrying cases/bags,…etc.. Ziploc Bags keep these loose papers together and away from liquid, so no worry on losing them or getting liquid-damaged, and they don’t clutter the temporary space you have to keep them in. By the time you’re ready to sort or organize them, they are all there, safe and sound.

When freezing breads, after placing in the appropriate ziploc bag use a straw to remove as much air as possible.
 Briar 
As a camp doctor, my whole field kit is stored in ziploc bags.
 http://none Linne 
I use them all over the house too .I buy 10 pound bags of chicken leg quarters&amp;sometimes pork chops or chuck steaks ,bacon,ham,sausage . I put one portion each in the quart size .I wash them after dinner with my dishes&amp;reuse til they get grungy or punctured . I put several portions in a gallon Bag,then in a grocery bag I mark with a sharpie , just bring in a bag or 2 from my deep freeze .Almosat forgot ,my pumpkin pie recipe makes 2.After they freeze hard I put them in gallon bags .One for Halloween&amp;one for Thanksgiving .
I use the gallon size too . Sometimes in the freezer .But also for craft supplies like fabric .I use the tiny ones for jewelry making supplies.
My favorite on from the 27 hints was for the umbrella&amp;I will soon drop one in my tote bag for that purpose .
I have used the 2 gallons size for special Big Magazines I wanted to keep .
Yeah gotta love ziplocs .
 http://Alice.com Jennifer Mock 
I use two ziplock bags for my phone when we go rafting. Phone goes in one which goes inside another bag with my license, keys and a couple of band-aids. If I have to get a band-aid my phone is still dry. The best part is that everything is in the same place!

My favorite Ziploc trick is one you mentioned, putting computer cables in Ziplocs. No tangling, and easy to find different types of cables. Cat 5 cables don’t get mixed up with USB cables any longer!
 http://alice.com Trisha Sutthoff 
My favorite is #21:
21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw.

I use Ziploc bags for EVERYTHING! I thought I knew all of the different ways to use a Ziploc Bag. Guess I was wrong. Just goes to show you how you can learn something everyday.
 Jacqueline 
I use them for everything! From spare baby outfit container (makes it easy to find in a crowded diaper bag) to hold crayons, light bright pegs, portable pet water bowl when we take walks on a hot day, to make shift ice packs for minor injuries.
 Lisa 
I take romaine lettuce hearts, tear up and rinse in salad spinner then place in the gallon size Ziploc bag with a folded paper towel. Lettuce stays fresh and is instantly ready for lulnch or dinner salads. Saves time and makes for a healthy choice.
 Vicki 
I use zip locks for everything. I store my flour in large bags to keep those pesky little bugs out–put the package and all in the bag. Love to use when traveling to store shampoo and make-up to prevent spills (I learned the hard way!). There are so many things I use these bags for—too many to mention.
 Kendra 
Love the square containers for my leftovers and veggies!
 Patricia 
I use Ziplocs for EVERYTHING! My favorite is to keep my veggies fresh I wrap them in a damp paper towel and put them in a Ziploc bag.
 Lisa H. 
Like everyone else, I use Ziploc bags for any and everything, but some of my favorites are:
* Use the 2 1/2 gallon bags to save special newspapers. I have several from the Millennium and they are still in excellent shape!
* Use a gallon bag to bread meats or vegetables. Dump in the flour and spices, drop in the meat or veggies, seal and shake! No more flour all over the counter!
* Use a quart size bag to hold some baby wipes (or whatever kind of wipes) and keep them in your purse. Much less room than one of those“on-the-go”packs of wipes and more economical.
* Use a quart size bag to collect sea shells and shark’s teeth while strolling on the beach!
 shane 
great for cell phones or portable game devices, protects the screen and helps in wet situations.
 Emily Wall 
I use large ziploc bags to keep all the yarn for each crochet project I am working on together. That way I can just grab a bag and know I have everything I need. And the yarn is protected from dust and spills.

When I make deviled eggs, I put all the filling ingredients in a Ziplock bag and knead it to mix…then snip off
a corner and pipe the filling into the eggs…Super easy and much less to clean up.
 Kristina 
Flip ziploc bags over onto pint glasses to keep bugs away at cookouts. I use this for iced coffee that I leave overnight for the next day!
 K Thomas 
When we travel&amp;camp with the kids I use the ZIPLOC for each days outfit (from underwear, sock to clothes) that when when it is time to bathe or change I just grab the ziploc for that child and and everything is there. So handy for the spouse with multiple children. It also compacts everything in the suitcase. In my linen closet are gallon&amp;2 gallon bags labeled with days of the week….just pull them out to pack for each trip…may be a little OCD but much easierat the hetic times…couldn’t live without them!!!
 Susanne Troop 
I use them to marinate meat and vegetables for kabobs…a no mess clean-up!
 Kevin 
When going to an amusement park with water rides, doing particularly sweaty exercise, or engaging in any other activity where your pockets may be soaked through, seal your wallet in a Ziploc!
 Amy 
We use Ziploc bags in our household for *everything.* We’ve always used them for food storage, but now that we have a little boy, I find myself using them for storage and organization of his toys. They really help because you can label what goes into the bags so the little puzzle pieces or car parts don’t get lost. :)
 Denise LeBegue 
We have a cabin in the woods and love to make ice packs with our Ziploc freezer bags. We can make different sizes and different shapes to fit perfectly in our cooler and around our items that really need to stay cold. The best part is that we can drink the ice cold water after we cook up our cold foods. What did we do before Ziploc?!
 Jan Pulliam 
When knitting with doubled yarn, I put each ball or skein in a different ziploc to prevent the yarns from twisting.
 Paula 
I carry a small ziploc bag around in my purse. Every time I spend money, I put the receipt in the ziploc. At the end of the week (or, when it’s full), the ziploc goes into my file (or box) of that year’s expenses. This way, if I ever need to check a receipt or dispute a charge, I have everything I need–and it’s already organized by date! I love this way of keeping track of my spending.
 Monique Hanson 
#4. Whenever I take jewelry on a trip it gets tangled so I decide not to take as much. Putting them in ziplocs is a great idea!!
 Mike Miller 
I use ziplock bags when scuba diving. One over each foot makes pulling on a wet wetsuit a snap!
 Lorraine 
When our dog needs to go to the dogsitter, we use a large Ziploc bag to hold his dog food and treats.

I store my radio, with the earphones and batteries, in a Ziploc Bag inside my Gym Bag, so it will not come in contact with my wet bathing suit&amp;towel
 Lesa 
I use ziploc bags to store practically everything in the nursing home where I work. They keep sterile things sterile so passing inspection is never a problem.
 http://Alice.com Gayle 
I always have a wash cloth in one and when needed can usually find water to wet it. I used to take a wet one but sometimes it would sour and smell funky. This way if I don’t use it I can just leave it for when I do and not have to worry about it smelling.
 Michelle 
#13. I love marinating in the ziploc bag. It’s clean and simple. We usually buy meat in bulk. I love to divide it into portions and store them in the freezer ziploc bags. Each night I pull out a bag of chicken, pork or beef for the next evening’s dinner. Great simple way to see what’s in the bag. Then I make a marinade and pour it into the bag. Best part: the cleaning. I just take out the meat and throw the bag away.
 Monica Zipay 
I use Ziploc bags all the time, but one of my favorite uses is that I put in a sleeve of crackers in a Ziploc, seal it shut, and crush them with a rolling pin. I then use the crushed crackers in my mixed meats, for breading, etc. instead of bread crumbs. The Ziploc is sturdy and durable and keeps the cracker crumbs inside the bag and not all over the counter!!
 Stefani 
I just moved to a new area 8 hours from home. Ziplocks are an essential tool needed for the moving process! I used snack sized bags to keep nails and fasteners together with their frames or art they held on the wall. I used quart-sized and gallon bags holding fluffy fragile items and blown up with air to keep these items from being crushed in their boxes. I even used Ziplock containers to have a few days of food for my dog accessible to allow time to get the giant bag of dog food unpacked.

I’ve used the containers for dog food for a long time actually, when we sent the dog to the“babysitter”or his“grandparents’house”:)
 Margaret MacDonald 
Whenever we have family gatherings and have cake, i like to show a little trick i do for people wanting to take cake but don’t want to place it between two plates so that the frosting does not smear…I place the plate with the cake pieces in a gallon size ziplock bag and slight close all but a small corner portion and have the person quickly blow into the bag to blow it up. It keeps the cake frosting from smearing all over the underside of the ziplock bag. WE do that for food plates too…works awesome.
 pamela 
WOW! where do i start??????? i always have a drawer full of ziplocs of all sizes………aside from the usual usage of lunch snacks, cut up fruit, sandwiches, left overs, keeping my just bought grapes fresh, my already washed strawberries fresh-all my fruit really-and generally all food stuff my ziplocs are so wonderful for everything around the house……i collect little things i find around town, washers, nuts, little metal pieces, etc…..a ziploc stores them all, the loose screws and nails, foreign coins, sweets for my purse, broken jewelry parts, when traveling all my toiletries, my jewelry, our passports……the craft bits from my daughter, the glitter (oh the glitter!), pencil sharpeners, markers, color pencils, chalk, erasers…….. magnets, we just moved so all those filled up drawers in the kitchen‘junk drawers’as i tenderly call them, had to be packed….me and my ziplocs did a GREAT job!, now i have a lot of ziplocs filled with fun stuff nicely placed in the kitchen drawers…..confetti, gift tags, ribbon, matches, i put them on my hands when i (not very often as i am a vegetarian) unwillingly but lovingly make meatballs for my unvegetarian boys (poor ziplocs)…..my list goes on and on but it is lunchtime and i must go make lunch, no doubt ziplocs will be involved…….they are so versatile and i love them!!!!!!
 Jackie 
I store all my important papers and receipts, like tax stuff, in a Ziploc bag or two each year. Keeps them together, compact, and protected. Better than the old shoebox technique of yore.
 Jennifer 
I use mine to store my keepsake items such as baby teeth, first haircut, etc. I don’t have to worry about them getting damaged and I can write the date on the front of the bag.

#13. Marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready–perfect because then you don’t get raw chicken on your tupperware or pans
 Toni A 
I buy burger and chicken in bulk and then separate into Ziploc freezer bags for easy portioning. Saves time and money.
 Mary 
I divide berries, that I won’t eat in time, into the snack bags then freeze to add to smoothies later

If you don’t want to lug around an entire wipes container or spend the money on a portable pack, just tuck some into a ziplock bag and go. Much cheaper to replace the wipes in the baggie than to keep buying the little packs of wipes!
 nicdeven 
Ziplocs are perfect for crushing crackers or pretzels for different recipes! I can put them in the bag and take out all the air and smash away without worrying the bag will rip! LOVE IT!
 Kim 
I use them to keep coupons together in my purse when shopping. Love them for travel, and of course snacks.
 Rachel 
putting crackers in a ziploc to crush them–avoids the mess of cracker crumbs and keeps my food processor free for another job!

Crush crackers in a Ziploc bag for no mess on the counter

I use the snack size ziploc bags to sort the colors of my child’s hairbows. That way I save lots of time coordinating her outfits with the right color hairbow.
 Lynda Laumeyer 
Ziplock sandwich and snack bags are great for keeping items easy to find in my purse. I put gum, coupons, toothpicks, hand wipes, etc. in their own separate Ziplock.
 Pam Fleming 
These uses are all great! I like to carry a wet washcloth in one to put in my purse when I have my grandkids. I just can’t seem to remember to buy wipes!
 Multiple Sclerosis Patient 
Due to my medical condition, I sometimes have to use a simple catheter. When out and about, I take one with me in a Ziploc bag.
Also, if you leave the catheter somewhat wet after cleaning it and you seal it in a Ziploc, that little bit of water and about 30 seconds in a microwave can effectively sterilize it.
 Dee 
Use Ziploc bags for clothing items when packing, then leave an inch or so open when you seal it and press the air out by kneeling on it or otherwise flattening it more to get out extra air. When you seal it and let go, it’ll be vacuum wrapped and take up less space. This is especially useful for sweaters and other bulky items!

My husband bags everything when he goes to Burning Man! It keeps everything free of playa dust until he’s ready to use it, and he can fit more things into his clothing bin. Also, when he gets back home, if there’s anything he didn’t use, it’s still fresh and clean in the bag and doesn’t have to be de-playafied!
 Courtney 
My favorite Ziploc tip is to put keys, cash, and phones in a Ziploc bag if you are in the pool, boat or anywhere near water! There is nothing worse than water damage!

I like to put the filling for deviled eggs inside a ziploc bag. Cut off one of the corners and then squeeze the filling into the egg whites. Easy and they look pretty too.
 Linda Henkel 
I am a card maker and need simple storage solutions for my embellishments and ribbon. I use sandwich size Ziploc bags to store my ribbon. I put one roll of ribbon in each bag and cut a small hole in the bottom corner. I thread the ribbon through the hole and ,using a clothespin, hang the Ziploc bag on a hanger. When I need ribbon, I pull out the amount from the Ziploc bag, cut it and voila, I finish my card!

I store my embellishments in sandwich size Ziploc bags and again hang them on a hanger where they are easy to see and find as I make cards.

Ziploc bags are the best!!
 http://www.JacksonvilleBeaches.MacaroniKid.com Karen 
I use Ziplocs in nearly every way listed above. What I did not see is an idea to use the small containers with lids to keep special bugs you little son brings in for the day. I have a little“bug house”with holes in the blue lid already waiting in the drawer for the next new bug-pet that comes in! (I do have to say that of all the ideas the one that is probably my favorite and gets used most is to marinate and/bread meat before grilling or baking. So tidy and no dishes to clean. Much safer from a food contamination standpoint than a bowl.
 afton marie 
I love the tip about organizing electronics wires and cords in labeled ziploc bags. My boyfriend is a total geek and has tons of extra wires and cords and connector dohickeys laying around, but we can never find the kind we need when we need it. If I could just ge him to tell me what half of them are even for, we could organize them enough to be able to find things! Amazing!
 Sally 
I use gallon ziploc bags to separate baby clothing into outfits in the suitcase when we travel. When it is time to dress the baby each day, just grab a bag and we’re all set!
 Katrina 
Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool! is my favorite and my most used!!!
 Melody Spence 
I put the freezer packs that come with medicine in them because the tend to get holes in the pack. Ziploc bags keep them from leaking and extend the life of the packs thus allows me to recycle them.
 Regina 
I think Ziploc products are the greatest thing since sliced bread!! Don’t know what I would do at my house without them. Helps not only with the obvious, food storage, but also with organization of toys, documents, etc. We also are never without Ziploc bags or storage containers when we go canoeing or camping.
 Pamela Long 
Ziplock bags have many uses from food to toy pieces. Use them in the refrigerator, freezer, lunchboxes to organizing in drawers. Very versatile.
 Melanie 
We pack in ziploc bags all the time, but love the small round containers for lunches. My kids’friends are so impressed that the only trash they have after lunch is a napkin. Everything else comes home to wash&amp;re-use.
 Jackie 
I use every Ziplock twice. We live in the country on a septic system. Needless to say, we use the disposal very sparingly. After I use a Ziplock bag for storage, I use it to freeze my non-compostable garbage. Once a week, it all goes out for the trash pickup. Such a deal!

 Rhoda Besecker 
Great for freezing nearly anything. I put one in a bowl, fill it with spaghetti sauce or whatever I want to store in the freezer, and after it is sealed and frozen, can store it for months without dedicating another container to the job.
 Donna Collins 
*Before going on a picnic I like to wet down a dishrag, add a bit of dish soap, and seal it in a Ziplock bag. It comes in handy for all kinds of situations.

*I like to store dog treats in Ziplock bags. It keeps them fresh, and they are easy to take when we go on car rides!

*If you like to travel with your own tea bags, Ziplock baggies are a perfect travel“container.”

*Ziplock bags are great for packing kids clothes going off to camp. Put an entire day’s clothes in one bag and label the day of the week. At the end of the day, the dirty clothes go back in that same Ziplock bag. Hopefully, this means the kids will NOT wear the same outfit the entire camp!
 Liz 
We use bags and containers for everything. My daughter had 3 different ones in her lunch today to reduce waste and save money!
 rob 
I use ziploc to store my wet scrubbing pads at work to clean my tea cup at the sink
 Ramesh Khalili 
21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw. I mean who doesn’t live bubble wrap?!
 Joy 
I love to use Ziplock bags for packing kids clothes. One outfit in wach bag, squish the air out, and you are set to go. No more hunting for tiny socks.
 Felicia 
I use ziplock bags for everything, but my favorite is to put crackers in and then let the kids crush them up when I need them for pie crust.. etc. I use them to let the kids make homemade ice cream also, it is quick and lots of fun for them!
 Daisey Gibson 
I use Ziploc bags for everything as well. Especially traveling. I separate everything with small bags and combine them all into 1 big bag. Great for wet clothes that need to be packed back home.
 Michele 
I use Ziplocs for everything. I use them to put the kids lunch money in…easy to label. I use them for everything from marinading meats to putting baby wipes in when we are on the go. They are so much more compact to carry.

Going to a theme park? Bring along a Ziploc bag to keep your park tickets from getting wet while on a water ride.
 http://www.onceinalifetimeweddingsandevents.com Melanie 
I use a large ziplock to store items that are in my Emergency Kit for weddings. I am a Professional Bridal Consultant, and almost always need something out of my kit. The ziplocks help keep the items organized and easy to access quickly.
 Elizabeth 
I use Ziploc for leftover storage, cheese blocks, kids toys, kids puzzle pieces especially! Snacks…have even used gallon ziplocs for dirty diaper disposal on the go! Keeps the smell out of the car! Use them as CD cases also in a pinch.
 matt 
We use Ziplocs every day–I pack lunches in the bags, and the small reusable containers are great for taking leftovers–and if they don’t come home, it’s not a big deal, because they are very reasonably priced!
 DB 
I use Ziploc bags for everything…my husband puts his wallet in a Ziploc bag to keep it dry when he goes fishing.
 Tammy 
I make apple crisp in 8 X 8 foil pans, bake it, cool it and slide each one into gallon size freezer ziplock bag. I label them, freeze them flat, then stack them up–then when ever we want apple crisp all winter I just have to take one out of the freezer and bag and pop it in the oven ~ Tammy
 Daisey Gibson 
1 tip I learned from my cousin is putting a few dollops of sour cream in a small bag, cut a small hole in the corner and just squeeze it out!
 Michele Barcelou 
I use the bags as a quick frosting piping that I don’t have to worry that the bag will explode from the pressure of piping the frosting onto cupcakes, cookies and cakes. They work great as ice pack as you don’t have to worry about dripping water from them. They are great for organizing small items also like safety pins, elastics etc. etc.
 Marcia 
I always take a ziploc baggie when we travel and keep my soap in it; I’m allergic to most soaps so this is a must for me. Clothing stays dry, soap is contained!! We do the same thing w/our toothbrushes
 Karen Tierney 
I put cookies in it and use a rolling pin to make crumbs for my lemon squares and/or cheesecakes/no mess on your counters and then just throw away!!!!!
 http://Smartideas Dolly 
I use a zip lock bag when I need to crush crackers for breaded steak or chicken. Pour what you need into a bowl and the rest seal up until you need them again. They are still fresh from being sealed in the bag.
 Lisa Arezzi 
My son cut out 100 happy faces from magazines for the“100 days of school”project. We put them in a gallon Ziploc bag so we can see the faces and it was fun to shake the bag and see the faces move.
 MM Golden 
I like to use them to store church offerings. We have a kids offering that goes for community services, for the poor, so any change I get through the week goes into a zip loc bag and then is ready for all the kids to come by at church.
 http://bluewillowbookkeeping.com Nancy Collins 
I get heartburn occasionally and without notice so I keep a few antacid tablets in a Ziploc snack size bag in each vehicle I drive–just in case.
 Michele P 
They’re the best for travelling, especially for airport security. I like to pack my numerous chargers in a gallon bag. I keep them there all the time at home so I’m not constantly hunting and then I just pick up the bag and go.
 Christel 
Goodness, what don’t I use ziploc baggies and containers for?! Taking crayons and coloring books on car trips; storing fresh veggies; marinating meats; taking wet washclothes for picnics; disposible camera left in the boat; the list is ENDLESS! But what I love most is that I can wash and reuse most baggies. What better way to save the environment and money!!
 Cynthia Palmatier 
I use large size ziplocs for my scrapbooking! I sort the pictures, backing pages, and stickers and any other things I plan to use for a specific page into the ziploc bag, seal it and place it into a tote bag. I will label each separate bag with the date and event with a removable label so I can reuse the ziploc when I finish a page. I will fill several of these and then just take the bags to my crafter corner meeting so I don’t have to take everyting I own just to work on my pages. I have been doing this for years!
 Lori 
In Diaper Bags. I use a larger one to keep new diapers clean&amp;separate, one for an extra change of clothing, one for snacks, smaller ones for wipes, one for eating utensils, one for diapering creams. This keeps the standard clutter of the diaper bag to a minimum. When you get home, replace what was used and you’re ready to go again.
 julie 
I use Ziplocs when frosting a cake, it is perfect for writing“Happy Birthday”. Just push frosting into a corner, cut a small hole in the corner, and write away!
 Helen Gray 
I slip small ones into my purse to take healthy snacks (nuts, fruits) in to the movies. Saves a little $$$$$$$, too.
 Lisa 
I use Ziplock for just about everything, but som eof my favorites are…
*I bring a variety of sizes to bring camping are perfect for all uses like snacks, leftovers staying dry in the ice filled cooler, bread from drying out in the dry mountain air, rope and small supply storage, and wet bathingsuits.
*I use the large ziplocs in my pantry. As soon as I bring home a new bag of flour, rice, pasta, pancake mix, and sugar the bag slips right over, zips closed and keeps little pantry pests from entering.
*In our tool cabinet we use ziploc containers to store screws, nails, nuts and bolts.
*The ziploc containers not only come in handy for storing leftovers in the fridge, but are also great for mixing up paint for small projects.
*Our freezer is filled with all sizes of ziploc bags storing meats for dinner and fruits for smoothies.
*When making fresh homemade ice cream I store the yummy treat in a ziploc container.
*When going on vacation ziploc are great for bringing along toiletries as well as keeping little keepsakes you want from your trip. We had a box of ziploc in our backback while in hawaii and we were able to collect sand and shells from several different beaches that we sent home and made a hawaii sand jars to remember our beautiful trip.
 Bill Rogers 
We use these to clean sneaker laces..We but bleach, detergent and water and our white sneaker strings in. Shake shake shake and let soak for a few minutes…Remove and rinse then hang dry. Don’t throw out the solution it can be used over again.. Saves water and prevents them from tying up things in the dryer…

can also be done with socks!!!
 Eva 
I love Ziploc snack bags I use them to make my own portion controlled snacks. I buy the regular size bags of the snacks I enjoy then put them in Zuploc snack bags.
 Karla 
I like to organize school supplies in Ziplocs.
 Jan 
I like to put a Ziploc on my head after I color my hair. I am then free to move about the house without worrying about the dye dripping on my carpet.
 erica mueller 
When roasting potatoes or other vegetables, put the chunks into a ziploc bag, add dry seasonings, seal and toss. Then add oil and massage the bag to oil the vegetables on all sides. This does a far more even job than the typical recipe directions to spread the chunks on a sheet pan, drizzle with oil, and mix with your hands.
 Dana Kime 
I use Ziplocs for lots of things, one of my favorites is keeping a bag full of chopped green and red peppers, mushrooms, onions, ham and asparagus in the freezer for egg omelets in the morning, just scoop out 1/2 cup per omelet. These feggies can also be used ontop of a pizza, in a salad or anywhere else you choose to use them!
 http://whichsandoval@yahoo.com Mary 
I use Ziploc to crush cereal or dry bread into crumbs, add seasoning, drop in egg washed chicken strips, zip it, give it a good shake, and chicken fingers are ready to bake or fry.
 Wendy 
I use the snack bags to hold things such as paper clips and rubber bands. All size bags are great for holding little toys like LEGO creations and the mini figures.
 Tracy C 
On Sunday mornings our young son takes something“quiet”with which to play in a Ziploc sandwich bag with him to church. He has chosen, for example: a small variety of legos; crayons and small coloring or notebook; stickers w/sticker book or notepad; a few action figures or army men; and the list goes on. He has been creative in filling his Zipocs!

Ziplocs are lifesavers in so many ways. I have used them in most of the ways described in the article. Thanks for the opportunity to win a variety!
 Karen Shinn 
We use Ziploc snack bags to store the different currencies we use for traveling Internationally. Keeps the wallet organized!
 Essie 
One of my favorite uses is separating larger bags of snacks (chips, teddy grahams, jujube bears, etc) into snack-size Ziploc bags. Controls portions sizes at snack time, and keeps snacks fresh and handy. Bonuses are that I used this method to teach my son to count (messy but effective), introduced him to what a“single serving”really looks like. And, kind of icky but really worked–during potty training, I let him choose his“reward”snack, which he always packed to the bathroom with him so he’d have it after he“went”. Having THAT particular snack in a Ziploc made the snacks impervious to random hygienic indiscretions, and helped momma’s peace of mind a lot!
 Hema Saravanan 
I love to use Ziploc bags for storing the half cut onion, tomatoes. I also use to store my small jewels, grouped and organized in the Ziploc which is easy to maintain. I cannot imagine a day without using Ziploc
 Mike Berger 
I use them all the time for packing. I have been moving my life around lately and the bags are perfect for things that are too small to exist on their own in the bag or box but don’t have their own container.
 Jean 
My sister likes to tease me—she says I’m the Ziploc queen. The largest bags were used to help my niece pack for college and to store out of season items like blankets and flannel sheets. I always buy bread on sale and put a loaf in a gallon sized bag and freeze it. Imprtant papers are kept in Ziploc bags for my hurricane kit each year. I also store all my travel supplies (3 oz or less) in my carry on bag when flying and use them in my checked bags for undies, toiletries, etc., so when they are opened by TSA, I don’t have to worry about everything spilling and being handled. I carry some empties in the car for emergencies and carry wet wipes as well. The smallest bags work for traveling office supplies and pens. I also use one to save coins for my youngest niece to put in her counting bank.

There are many more ways I use them—I couldn’t live without them!
 Kathy Schoenherr 
What don’t I use ziploc bags for is a better question. My most recent new use is to put my audio CDs in a ziploc bag in my car so the they stay clean and dry.
 http://lizetteoconnor.com Liz 
Oh gosh, for everything! Put my cell phone in one when on the boat and bring extras for everyone else, cause they all want to copy what I am doing to protect their phones, too! I also use them to separate the BOXTOPS for the kids to take them to school, individually! When I travel, to put Q-tips and for anything greasy like shine or gel for my hair, the bigger ones for the shampoo and conditioner in case they explode in the suitcase, my clothes are protected! So many uses!
 Andi 
I use them to freeze pancakes!
 Miranda Curzon 
We use large ziplocks to pack clothing on backpacking trips–if you squeeze the air out of the bags before sealing them, they compress your clothing and take up less space in your pack. It also keeps them dry!

I also like to make homemade chicken stock and freeze the extras in the screw-top containers–very convenient and easy to organize in our freezer.
 Peter 
I have a lot of toys from my childhood, but they’re in big bins, all mixed together. I use Ziploc bags to help me organize them by placing each complete set of a toy in one bag, then label it with a marker. So now Optimus Prime, complete with hands, trailer, car (that goes in the trailer), and other random parts, can stay together. Works great for Lego sets too.
 Elizabeth 
I use ziploc bags and containers to freeze food for later. I divide it into single-serve portions before freezing, so it’s easy to get out just what I need.
 Melanie 
I love to use Ziploc bags when I travel to store various items–medicine, shampoo, etc. I also use them when we travel on the plane to hold my daughter’s“clean”toys and“dirty”ones–ones that have dropped on the ground.
 Erica Best 
i buy chicken and other meats by the case to save money and it use freezer ziploc to store the meat it works great.
 http://www.hearmemom.wordpress.com Amy King 
Instead of taking the whole diaper bag to the store and on short outings, I use freezer size ziplocs to store a few diapers and wipes for my 19mo old son. I always say Ziplocs and auto advancing phone number fields on web forms MAKE MY DAY!!!
 http://www.geocities.com/vaughanelectric Kimberley Vaughan 
We own a business and I buy small parts in bulk then divide them up in ziplock bags for resale.
 NG 
I think I’ve used them for all 27 things you have listed, plus some! I like to seal banana peels in the snack size before throwing them away. That way my trash can doesn’t stink before it’s full,&amp;it keeps those little“banana”bugs away!
 g 
i use them as piping bag for whip cream, just fill and snip off a corner!
 http://alice.com Miranda 
I work at a hospital, and deal with poop a lot!!! I use a Ziploc container to keep an extra set of scrubs in my locker at work, if I get pooped on, I change into my clean scrubs and put my dirty ones tightly sealed in my Ziploc container!!
 TNB 
I store all my yarn in Ziploc bags so that the wool moths don’t get inside!
 Bonnie Sue 
I use them to start my garden seed in the winter for spring plant out. I use a clear plastic tub. Drill a few holes into the bottom of tub for drainage. Drill holes all over the top to supply snow/rain moisture thorough out the winter months. Take a Ziploc bag poke a few holes in the bottom of the bag for drainage. put soil 3/4 wy full then place seeds on top and place into tum with the top edge rolled down and open. Place the lid on and carry out doors. Place where it will receive rain/snow and wait for spring. Reuse the tub each year. Under the bed storage tubs work well. As soon as sprouts are 2″plant out. In srping move to a more shaded location to prevent plants from too much heat or remove the lid.

I ziplock
 Cloi Rowley 
I use Ziploc bags to help keep my scrapbooking supplies organized. I have large bags for each theme (ex. Christmas). Inside, I have smaller bags which contain stickers, die cuts, and other embellishments.
 Jo Graeber 
*I use a small Ziploc to keep lipstick, fold-up brush, small comb, nail clippers, polish and other
small items that now won’t get lost in my purse.

*I keep all my pill bottles in a larger bag beside my chair so they are handy and I have them all
when time to take them.

*I keep small candies in a small Ziploc beside my chair for watching tv or typing. I also keep one in
my purse for long waits.

*I keep a medium Ziploc filled with paper clips, mini-stapler, small box of staples, and small pair
of scissors (with cover so as not to poke through) which is handy for cutting coupons, or ideas and
stories from newspapers and magazines. Its a must have to keep beside my chair and one on
my desk.

*I don’t sew very much, so all I need is a medium Ziploc bag to hold my various spools of
thread and a container of needles, needle threader and small pair of scissors with cover. I’m ready to mend!

*I love traveling with my mini computer, and find Ziploc bags fantastic for protecting my
earphones, my mini-mouse, and a couple of flash drives. What a perfect fit for purse or computer case.

*I keep a spare house key and a car key (I have locked myself out more than once!) buried a few
inches deep outside my house in case of emergencies. Protected in a small Ziplock bag, I don’t worry about rains or dirt damaging my keys or having to stick wet, dirty keys into the locks.

*Carry a medium (depending on the size of your dog) Ziploc bag with you on walks in case of
potty problems. Just insert your hand on the outside of the bag, push your covered hand through the opening like a glove to pick up the poop, then pull your hand back through the slot (holding onto the poop), and zip! It’s a perfect pooper scooper and your hands stay sanitary.

*I really injured my finger one day, pulling the nail off and down deep. I could not stand having
a bandage get near it! So, after putting an antibiotic gel on it, I slipped a Ziploc bag over my hand and zipped it up a bit to protect my hand. It made people aware not to touch my hand, and kept me from accidentally forgetting to use it and hurting it further. It still got air, yet nothing touched it.

*When my daughter had a rash of nosebleeds, the doctor suggested saline drops and Afrin nose
spray. I sent both bottles to the school nurse (required at school), along with the note from the doctor with instructions enclosed for her times of use, with her name written across the Ziploc bag.

*I keep my car registration, tag receipt, and insurance proof in a Ziploc bag in my glove compartment. No digging for me! I just whip out the bag and the officer has everything he needs! (Thank goodness I’ve only had to use it once!)

*When we eat at fast food places, and wind up with more salt or ketchup packs than we used, (they don’t like for you to put them back, as it is deemed to be unsanitary even though they are in unused condition), we put our leftovers in a Ziploc bag for use later at home. Or if we get our food to go, and they put the condiments in the bag and we use our home bottles, we keep the condiments in our Ziploc for times when we run low at home.

*We don’t always know when we might eat out, so I keep Ziploc bags in my purse at all times. We have a grateful dog at home that looks forward to our leftovers that I dump into my Ziploc. She always smells us when we get home to see if we brought her anything.

*I use the larger Ziploc bags for picking up. As i go around the living room or dining room (or
wherever), I am constantly finding little things that the kids leave behind. Pencils here, a lanyard there, school papers over there, a pencil sharpener under there, a belt thrown down on the couch, you get it. All such things are thrown into a large Ziploc and either taken to the child’s room—or put into the closet until the found item has been discovered missing by the child. Then we talk!

*Why buy expensive boxes for scrapbooking stickers and such? I use large Ziploc bags for separating the various projects. All my dog items (even punches and dies if bought for that particular purpose), colored pencils, papers, etc. go into the Ziploc bag. I have one for each of five recipes books I am working on for the kids (my recipes will disappear when I die if I don’t write them down for them). I have paperdolls dies, cut outs, recipe cards and anything I want to use for each book. They lay flat and take up little space.

*When I have groups of things like doll furniture, small dolls with clothing that belongs to that doll,
packages of stickers, or any other things I need to group together and keep up with without losing, I put each group into separate Ziploc bags after I take their pictures. That way, after I list the items on various lists and auctions I use, they won’t get misplaced or lost by the time they are sold. I can also use a marker to write on the bag which list I used and the price for easy finding.
 TNB 
Also, I use a quart size bag to mix pancake batter (right in the bag) and then cut off the tip, so that I can“draw”with batter in the pan.
 http://none T White 
My favorite tip:
When I begin packing for a trip I put a package of ziploc bags in the suitcase. Then I know I will always have a bag when needed. Sometimes for a wet swimsuit, sand or seashells from the beach, small souvenirs, to hold ice, snacks for the car, beach, etc.
 Creepy 
I use ziplock bags as gloves when handling chicken to freeze. Just turn the bags inside out, slip your hand inside and grab the chicken, then turn the bag right-side-in around the chicken and seal before putting in the freezer. It really cuts down on the amount of things you have to wash after handling raw chicken and works like a dream.
 Kaylene Frost 
Ziplocks are handy for emergency kits for the car or home. Just place your first aid kit, food, and accessories in them for easy and waterproof storage.
 R Ray 
I like the Manual storage idea, but my best use is to store all of my better drill bits to keep them clean and RUST Free. All of those are good ideas.
 Patty 
I use Ziploc bags for storing my cut fabric pieces by color, size, and order for each quilt project I am working on. After the quilt is complete, I also use Ziploc bags to store the left over scraps for future quilt projects. Nothing is ever wasted. The Ziploc bags keep the fabric free from bugs and color safe.
 Amy Due 
I have used #3&amp;I like # 10 will have to try it on my daughters puzzels.
 Esther Quinn 
Mash a few overripe bananas in a small ziploc bag, flatten the bag and toss in the freezer for your next homemade banana bread. Two large bananas are usually enough for one loaf.
 Ella Cole 
I take a ziplock bag with me to amusements parks, and if I go on a wet ride, I make sure to put my camera in it to keep it dry.
 terry primeaux 
we use ziploc for just about everything but my favorite way to use ziploc storage bags is for baby wips. a hand full of baby wipes for my little one fits nice and compact in my purse.
 Tom Watson 
I grind my own Flaxseed and store in Ziploc bag.
 Joan Carol 
I use a small sandwich ziploc when writting on cakes by making a small snip off the lower corner. It is perfect for writing with icing
 http://Alice.Com Madonna Johns 
I love all the Ziploc containers and bags and have used them for many years for literally everything, from freezing to cooking, storage and travel, and lunch boxes. I love to cook large quantities and divide into containers to be used later. Don’t have to pay all that cash for already made meals when hurrying to go to work or whatever.

My favorites of all are the steaming bags….I have a problem in finding them here in Rochester, WA. All the stores carried them at first; and now I can hardly find them.

Does no one know how wonderful steamed vegies are? The amount of time it takes to steam products instead of cooking them the old-fashioned way is amazing! I know you can buy vegies already prepared in steaming bags; but you can also put fresh vegies in them and freeze….ready to cook…even put your seasonings in there…If you like baby red potatoes, for instance, they come out beautiful and you season them first so no hassle to fix.

I took a fresh head of cabbage and cut into wedges. I put seasoning in and put in the microwave. SOooo Good! This is the time of year for all those good garden foods!!! Get them ready for winter and be so pleased that you can cook so easily….
 Angela Powers 
You can use 2 Ziploc bags as an icecream maker!

Half fill a gallon sized ziploc bag with icecubes and 1 tablespoon of rock salt

In a quart sized ziploc bag put:
1/2 cup of half and half or whipping cream
1 Tablespoon of sugar
1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Zip the bag closed and place into the gallon ziploc bag. Shake the bags until the quart bag is full of icecream (10 mins or so)

Great activity for kids, with a delicious treat afterwards!
 Lena 
I have lots of young adluts in the family. I keep a Ziploc bag full of contraception where they can have easy access without feeling embarssed.
 http://alice.com Sherry Hodgson 
I use them for a variety of reasons including as an ice pack and for sending in our schools Box tops for redemption.
 http://www.timeshareforums.com Frank Siragusa 
I love using them to bring back to life dried out Cigars that look like they have had it. You need to use 2 different sizes for this trick,one has to fit inside the other with room. First pop a few holes in the smaller bag then take part of a wet sponge and place it inside the holy bag. Take the holy bag and place that inside the larger bag. Then take Dried out Cigars and place those inside the bag, Close the Zip lock and do not touch it for 4 days. Check it on the 4th day if they are slightly soft it worked and you can smoke them as if they were just rolled.
 Dawn Wynkoop 
I like to use mine for crushing nuts for recipes. I just place them in the Ziploc Bag and roll over them a few times to get the consistency I want and then just open the bag and pour into my recipe. Less mess and so convenient to keep the remainder of the nuts in when I don’t use them all!
 Jessica Mortvedt 
My favorite thing is to store my daughters crayons in a ziploc bag. When I go out to eat, I always have the crayons ready to go and hey won’t make a mess in my purse.
 Brenda 
My daughter was helping me paint a newly-remodeled bathroom in our house, as one final touch in getting the house ready to sell. She wanted to listen to a book on her Kindle while we were painting but didn’t want to get paint on it. Her solution? A Ziploc bag, of course. All of our stuff had already been moved to the new house, but my daughter knew I’d keep the essentials around until the very end. Yep. There were the assorted sizes of Ziploc bags. The bathroom looks great, by the way.
 Chelsea 
I use the bags and the containers for marinating my meat. I can throw a messy marinade in the bag and it won’t leak and can toss it when I’m done so I don’t have to clean up the mess.
 Allison 
I love keeping Ziploc baggies in my diaper bag to keep dirty diapers in, if no trash can is nearby.
 Lynda Gokey 
When canning isn’t possible, I get my veggies&amp;spaghetti sauce ready and zip them in a Ziploc freezer bag. I can label&amp;date them and they last all winter!
 http://mysticmom63@yahoo.com Tammy Cushman 
I like to embroider and I work on multiple projects. I use the 2 gallon size ziplock bags to hold each project and then I can just pick which bag I want to work on.
I use ziplocks for everything everyday. My daughter calls me the ziplock queen! BUT when she did and exchange trip to France, she was very glad I sent a handful of empty bags with her to hold her little things. It helped with customs.
 Tami 
When we go to the beach, I put everything we need in Ziploc bags~ they keep everything dry and sand free~
 Joyce 
I get the giant-sized bags, which I use for clothing storage. Also great for moving!
 Tina 
My favorite is the Ziploc omelet in the microwave. Yummy!
 Katie 
I love using ziplock bags to protect my electronics. If it seems like it may rain, I stick my mp3 player in a small sandwich bag and push the controls through the barrier in order to keep from getting water in it. I also store my netbook in a large ziplock bag so that if water gets into my backpack it will not get onto my netbook! This is a great way to protect paperbacks and maps too.
 Rene Ryan 
I use ziploc everyday for my daughters lunches. I also like to use when we travel to put our toothbrushes in that way everything doesn’t get messy. I like to put those small items that come with all the dollies in them as well, that way you know where they are and are not searching the house when your daughter is begging you to find those little pink‘Polly Pocket’shoes!
 Carol Whitlock 
I liked and use suggestion #15. I have also used a larger Ziploc bag to ice a sprained ankel while on vacation.
 Mary Ellen Zent 
When my medical supplies arrive each month, I take them out of the boxes and put each item in Ziploc bags. The bags are more compact than the boxes, and I can see exactly what I have.
 Erika H. 
I use ziploc bags to store my scrapbook supplies. I can see exactly what I have that way.
 michelle 
I use Ziploc bags in the following ways:

1–Put deviled egg mixture inside, snip off a corner and fill with no mess.
2–When making Chicken Cordon Bleu, I place my chicken in a Ziploc freezer bag before pounding the meat to make it an even thickness.
3–When I go camping, I put all each the ingredients into Ziploc bags and then all of them into larger bags for each meal. Any heating directions get written on the outside of the large bag.
4–On roadtrips, I keep a few Ziploc bags in the glove compartment so that if one of the kids gets carsick, it is contained, and the smell can get zipped up til we can find a place to dispose of it properly.

Thanks for the great invention! I use them daily!

I freeze food-processed roasted hatch chiles in ice cube trays. When frozen, I dump them into a Ziploc and use in soups and sauces throughout the year. This works well with pesto, carmelized onions, leftover coffee (for shakes), and leftover wine (for cooking).

When my kids were small I always packed them in Ziplocs. This was great to keep the matching socks, bows, and outfits together. This also worked well when my girls went to sleep-away camp. They still pack this way for mission trips and school trips–just grab a bag on the way to the shower and they are set for the day!

I just sent one daughter to Argentina for school for 8 months. When she asked what (besides the basics) to bring the response was overwhelmingly–Ziploc bags. she took every size, including the 2 gallon for her laptop to give it extra protection in the rain.

I use ziplock bags to freeze left over rice. Hit up the rice in ziplock bag in a microwave for 2 minutes whenever I need, it tastes like freshly cooked rice!
 Harriet Clark 
Snack-sized Ziplock bags are perfect for helping the dieter with portion control of snacks. It makes it easier to be mindful of just how much is a“serving”so you don’t over do it.

When I am packing to travel I put anything that may leak in my luggage in a gallon Ziploc bag. I also take a couple of extras for wet swimsuits from a last minute dip in the pool before heading home!
 Eddie Rewis 
I use Ziploc bags to store and seperate my fishing tackle. Extra hooks stored for long periods want get wet and rust in a Ziploc bag. Seperate weights and sinkers by size and mark the bag with a sharpe so you can quickly get the right weight. I store my fishing license and boat registration papers in a Ziploc to keep them dry.

I keep the fork or spoon that I use for my kitty cat’s wet cat food inside a ziploc baggie and store it in the fridge. It keeps it from getting all over my fridge AND it’s less dishes to do!
 Jennifer 
I store my animals’vaccination records in a gallon size ziplock bag. No chance of spilling anything on them!

When I go on a roadtrip, I put enough dogfood to last until we arrive at our destination so I don’t have to drag a big bag into the hotel rooms with me.

As a gardener, #23 appeals to me, my knees are always a work of art otherwise. And as potters, we sometimes need to make a“quick trip”into the house and don’t always want to stop to remove our shoes. Since we have hardwood floors through out the house, a quick way to save them is to slip Ziplocks right over our clay encrusted shoes. The grit stays where is belongs and our house stays free of clay dust! Thanks, Ziplocks!
 Mary Keller 
One of the many ways I use Ziploc is:

My husband and myself own a Harley Motorcycle and Love to go riding. I use the larger Ziploc bag to store our smaller gear in -EX: Gloves, scarves, Hair Clip, Sun Glasses. This way its all together and in one place and when we are ready to ride, I grab one thing–the Ziploc bag. I also take it with us so if we stop along the way, I put them back in the bag for easy storage and a dual purpose if it rains they will stay dry!!
 Sarah B 
I prepare my meals in advace and freeze them in ziplox bags. I also makesalsa and freeze it in the small storage containers and just pull one container out whenever we need it this way we can freeze and eat without messing with other containers.
 Mary Clinton 
I use ziploc bags to take some quick snacks for my son when we are running out of the house. I often times put cherrios in them. I also use them to create my own 100 calorie packs since it is usually cheaper to buy a bigger package and split it up.

I also use them to preserve collectors magazines and newspapers. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup this year and I have been putting all the yearbooks and magazones in Ziploc bags before I put them in a bin.
 Susan K 
Measure dry ingredients such as flour, baking powder and spices, for your favorite recipe (muffins, cake, bread) and place them in ZipLoc bags. When you want to bake, empty the ZipLoc into a mixing bowl and add the eggs, oil, water, etc.
I love to take these along when we vacation at our timeshare—I can make lots of goodies without having to take or buy all the miscellaneous ingredients!
 Kris 
I put a wet washcloth in a Ziploc bag and put it in my diaper bag to use when my kids need a face washing! It’s less waste than using baby wipes, and you just put the dirty washcloth back in the Ziploc when you’re done, then replace it with a clean one when you get home!
 Amy Hassenpflug 
I love to use Ziploc bags when making deviled eggs. I put all of the“devil”ingredients in the bag, smush it around to mix well, then cut off one corner. Through the tip this creates, I can squirt out delicious, attractive deviled eggs with NO MESS! Suck the last remaining goodness from the bag, then toss. No clean-up required!
 http://Alice.com G.L. 
I learned from my sister to place a week’s (or month’s if you prefer) different expenditures in separate Ziploc bags, such as grocery money, eating out, Starbucks. Once that bag is empty, that particular expense is used up! This is a great motivator to plan ahead and be more aware of wasting money on things that we take for granted. If there’s cash left at the end of the week, it goes into a“savings Ziploc”. And boy, is it gratifying to see that one grow!
 Michelle 
I put baby wipes in a ziplock bag for easy cleanups on road trips and camping trips
 Dawn Mills 
I used Ziplock bags when I was moving. I stored washers, screws, nuts and bolts for furnture that was disassembled and needed to be reassembled. I was able to separate the hardware and label it so that there was no confusion when time to reassemble the furnature.
 martha jones 
Use Ziploc bags to crush flakes for toppings for casseroles. Place flakes in bag, seal, and then pound with a glass or similar object.
 Annessa 
I put everything in ziplock bags!!! My family and friends say I’m addicted. Use them when we travel, use them in my business (I own a gourmet food business,) use them daily at home. Perfect for putting anything that needs to stay together, together! Also use many of them in my scrapbook room! Ribbons by color, die cuts by type.. the list is endless. There is NOTHING that you can’t use a Ziplock item for!! LOVE them so!
 Karen 
My son uses different size baggies and the containers to sort his leggo pieces. It’s a great way to keep from losing the tiny pieces and makes it so much easier to find the pieces he wants when creating a new leggo masterpiece.
 DeeDee 
I use ziploc bags to store children’s cardboard puzzles. The cardboard boxes take up a lot of room and often‘break down’after minimal use. But if you cut the puzzle‘picture’off the front of the box and place the picture and pieces together in a ziploc bag, you can store many puzzles in a small place.
 http://alice pam 
just got done taking my son to college everything in bags so it does not get mixed up with the other boys
 Pat 
I use ziplock bags for everything, but my favorite use is to store my medication in when I travel. It is so efficient. Also, your medication is easy to find if you should need it urgently.
 Tisa 
I love using ziploc bags for so many things…my current favorite is to use them to crush up peanuts to put on top of Pad Thai.
 stacy townsend 
I use them to freeze meat that I buy in bulk….divide it up. Marinades and lunches for my son also.
 Jessica Somerville 
Extra large ziploc allows you to store kids clothes by size and items so that they are easy to pull out for the next child.
 Randi 
I use a gallon size Ziploc slider bag as a diaper clutch. It holds 4 diapers and a pack of wipes easily, then fits into my purse with no problem. I can grab the bag when I need to make a quick diaper change in a store and wipe the outside off easily to get rid of all those changing table germs. I also tend to carry the girls’sippy cups in my purse/diaper bag and more than once they have leaked. It’s great to know those diapers will stay dry till I need them!
 Shirley 
I like to store my leftovers in ziplock bags that way I am not constantly looking for something to store the leftovers in.

Use A large Ziplock to keep smaller ziplocks dry.
 http://happyhandsstore.com Margaret 
My favorite Ziploc tip from your list is:

2. Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords.

And my own favorite use for Ziploc bags is for my knitting projects: large bags to store my knitting-in-progress, smaller bags to hold individual balls of yarn. Keeps my work clean&amp;dust free, and discourages inquisitive kitties!
 Heather 
I used them all the time in art school. I Ziplocked my pallet of paints. That way a custom mixed color can still be used the next day!
 Michele Scott 
I love using ziploc freezer bags in the fall and winter to freezer small portions of big batches of soup and stews. It saves so much room in the freezer and I just grab, thaw, and viola, lunch/diiner is served.
 http://Mags626@aol.com Maggie 
Snack size ziploc bags are the perfect size for storing an I.D., cash, and a key for a run. Slip it in in your sports bra for a run and your items stay dry. Always be prepared!
 Erin Trotter 
I use Ziploc bags as pastry bags. They are awesome!! Works wonders when making deviled eggs look pretty or decorating cakes. I have so many uses for Ziploc bags. The especially come in hand when storing the kids crayons or small toys. Thank You Ziploc!!!!!!!
 Julia 
I use large ziplocs when I pack for long trips abroad. I fold all of my clothing neatly (or roll t-shirts, etc) and put everything in ziplocs by clothing“type”or outfit and then squish all of the air out so I can fit more in my suitcase! It’s also great because you can dig around in your bag to find what you need without wrinkling clothes and messing things up–no repacking! Empty bags are then great to segregate the dirty clothes!
 Jennifer Zacharias 
I like the idea of using Ziploc bags for bubble wrap. I sell all of my textbooks online, but I think this would be a better filler than newspaper. :D
 Cathy Nichols

Tomatoes taste great when picked fresh from the garden, so why not enjoy that flavor all year round! Take a freshly picked tomato, and core it, then cut in 1/4 and place in blender. After a 30 second blend, place in quart size Ziploc baggie and flash freeze. Success! Simple and Sweet! The best tasting tomatoes in the dead of winter:)
 Jennifer Zacharias 
Oh, and you can use them to make HOMEMADE ICECREAM! :D

I definitely depend on Ziploc bags whenever I pack a lunch for school or work.. so much easier that carting plastic containers back and forth..
 DiDi 
We use the gallon size ziploc bags when we pack for a road trip. One day worth of clothing (including socks and undies) goes in a bag and then in the suitcase. The kids can grab a new bag each morning and get dressed. Keeps suitcases organized with no need to search for socks or undies or whatever!
They put their dirty clothes from the day before into the used baggie, which helps keep socks from getting lost along the way.
 Shawn 
I use Ziploc bags to store away my game used memorabilia. It great for the items that have not been washed and can have a bad odor to them. Great protection from the household elements and for my nose. LOL
 Loretta Moye 
I save by purchasing large bags of chips, and ahead of time I divide the bag into Ziploc Bags. So they are ready for lunches, snacks for the kids ect.

I like to make my own soup broth, fill ziplock quart bags with it, lay it flat on a cookie tray and freeze it. Voila! Perfect portions for a pot of soup, and since they’re flat, they stack nicely without taking up a lot of room!
 http://www.parymoppinsperfectlypractical.blogspot.com Julie 
I love love love Zip Loc bags to freeze food flat. It’s so easy and less bulky to store food that way.
 Myrna 
I use Ziploc bags of all sizes. As a therapist, I put puzzles in the gallon size, larger puzzles in the 2 gallon size, glue bottles in quart or sandwich sizes, paints, dot markers, crayons, markers, tape, stapler, baby wipes, craft supplies such as glitter, pom poms, construction paper, scissors, beads, yarn, etc., and everything else I use, in whatever size is needed for each item. Then they all go in my bag on wheels that I take to the preschool, home, daycare, or clinic that I treat at. Because the bags are see-through, I can quickly find what it is I am looking for. And if a glue or paint bottle opens, it doesn’t make a mess on all my other stuff! What a GREAT help Ziploc bags are!
 carmen 
i love ziploc bags! i use them for anything and everything!! i use them to store food and vegetables etc.. they are great!

15. When there’s a boo-boo, break out a Ziploc sandwich bag and fill it with ice.
 Stacy 
I like to use ziploc bags for numerous things including, seperating my daughters barrettes and ribbons by color into seperate bags. This helps to match her to outfits more easily each day. I use them for portion control on my snacks, while I’m doing Weight Watchers and when I want to cook up and freeze meals. Not to mention when I received my list for back to school supplies, the school requested not just any storage bags, but Ziploc specifically. How cool is that!
 Naomi Wynne-Whetstine 
I use my Ziploc fo rmany things. I really like the number one idea about putting all of you spare keys in them.
 trish wuerfele 
I store my chilrens puzzle and games pieces in them so they don’t get lost being in the box. I also her the play dough in ziplock baggies so it’s doesn’t dry out
 Angela 
I decorate all my cakes using ziplocs. It’s a great way to make different size lines and pretty dots without having to change the tip of a pastry bag.
 addie maiden 
I use the snack size bags to put board game pieces in then put them in the game box!
 http://commandercodycostume.com Suzi 
I keep one Ziploc container of dog food and one Ziploc container of clean water in my van. That way, if we’re out of the house for a long period of time, I know my dog won’t go hungry or thirsty!

I also love to batch cook! I ladle whatever I’ve batch cooked: sauce; beans; broth; into Ziploc freezer bags, squeeze out all the air, label them and freeze them flat on a cookie sheet. Once they’re frozen, I stack them up neatly in the freezer. It’s like having little bags of gold in the freezer =)

There are so many ways to love a Ziploc!
 Melinda Kelly 
I buy the large packages of buy1 get1 free meats at the grocery store and divide them into smaller packages in Ziploc freezer bags so I’ll have meal sized portions.

I use the ziploc containers to freeze soup in. I make a big batch of soup or chili and freeze it in the small containers. My husband will grab one out of the freezer for his lunch.
 daniel 
I put snacks in ziplocs to take along to work or on trips.
 Adrian Massey 
Instead of searching for bowls and lids, I use Ziploc bags. I always use freezer bags because they are so strong. Ziplocs are also great for travel too!

I love idea #21–I am always searching around for old newspaper to use as packing material, but air-filled ziplocs will look much cleaner and clutter-free and save the searching!
 DEIDRE 
I LOVE THE TIP ABOUT STORING LEFT OVER PASTA.
I use zip locks in so many ways besides the obvious.
Zip locks: I store my paint roller in them if I know I will be painting later in the day or the next few days..it’s ready to get started right up!
I also store paint brushes for the same reasons.
I recently got one of the trendy big pocketbooks, I tried cosmetic bags to organize. Zip locks are so much easier I can see what I need readily.
I have always stored kleenex in a zip lock, they don’t break down, especially the treated with lotion ones.
I carry them with the grandchildren, storage for diapers, clean and dirty. Face cloths moistened to avoid the use of commerical cloths…when water will suffice.
I cut corn off the cob and freeze in zip locks for great corn in winter.
 Veronica L. 
Ziploc is great! I love to store food in the bags, of course. But my favorite function is to keep toiletries in them while traveling!
 Cindy 
Although it never rains in LSU’s Death Valley!…I always bring a quart size Ziploc in my pocket to stash my cell phone and wallet for protection from the unexpected shower! It has saved my phone and more. Ziplocs are lifesavers!
 Elisa 
Whenever I have a cold but have to be out of the house, I make sure to take at least two ziplocs: one with fresh tissues and one (or more) empty. If I am not near a trashcan, I can put used tissues in an empty ziploc. The ziploc contains the mess and germs of the used tissues.
 Craig 
We take several Ziploc bags of different sizes to our veggie garden each afternoon. One bag for beans, one for cherry tomatoes, one for strawberries, one for blueberries, one for blackberries, one for lettuce, one for basil, one for sage…etc. If we’re not using the veggies that night, everything is presorted for storage.
 Mary Kay 
I love to organize—Ziploc makes it easy!
 Kathleen 
My husband thinks I am addicted to Ziploc bags because I use them for everything. My newest use is to take my youngest son’s can’t-sleep-without stuffed animal (Ellie the Elephant) back and forth with him to preschool. Ellie has her very own labeled Ziploc. This way, if the Ziploc is empty, we know we need to get Ellie.
 Joy L C 
I love Ziploc everything! I use them for everything too. I like to kind of press all the air out of the bag before I seal it…even for sandwiches. (Just don’t squish your sandwich!)
 Heather 
I use ziploc bags to make little first aid kits for my diaper bag. I alo use them to store crayons, markers and playdough.
 Tena 
We use ziplocks for keeping our freezers organized (a must when you have 3 of them!). The best ever thing was when I went to Ecuador many years ago; we used gallon sized ziplocks for all of our clothes to keep them dry in the rainforest. It cut down on packing space and it was wonderful! Just put your folded clothes in bags, push the air out, and you’re all set!
 http://Alice Katy 
I store my kids change of clothes in the diaper bag in a large ziploc. That way when they get messy I can put the messy clothes in a bag without getting the diaper bag dirty.
 Jennifer 
I put some water in ziploc sandwich bags and freeze flat, to make“ice packs”to put around my daughter’s sandwiches for school so she doesn’t complain about melted cheese anymore! Best part–she can use them even when brown bagging, and I don’t worry about her throwing away the ice pack!
 Carol Sikler 
I use the gallon-sized bags for packing. Whoosh the air out of them and your clothes take up less space. That also guarantees that I will have one available for the swimsuit that doesn’t get dry.
 http://inkingitup.blogspot.com Julie S. 
I love storing electronic gizmos in ziploc bags—keeps out moisture and sand—and keeps the cords together…but I use them throughout my house, in my car, and when travelling…I am always excited by new products that make storing easier and don’t take up much space when not in use. Ziploc’s almost always fit the bill!
 Raymond Klein 
Put your camera in a Ziploc before going to the beach. It keeps out sand, water and spray that could damage it. You can also take pictures through the bag.
 Jamie 
I store a change of clothes for each of my kids in a large ziploc and leave them in the car. I always have a complete set when I need it. I also add a diaper if needed for that child.

Here are just a few ways we use our Ziploc bags:

We carry our luggage on board when we fly, for this a quart sized bag is essential. We carry extras in the event one should become lost.

Carrying wet suits home from the pool.

Freezing batches of sauces and other leftovers.

Repackaging foods that came with fragile packaging like bags of salads, English muffins, etc.

Storing bulk herbs and spices.

Use as a mini trash bag when out and about, saving messes from our purses or pockets.

Whatever did we do before“zippy”bags?
 Deborah 
I love the Ziploc snack bags. They are the perfect size for our 6 year old daughter who tends to eat in small portions. They hold just enough so she doesn’t feel overwhelmed by having to much food to eat. (The bags always come home empty from school!)
 Jaime 
I send a gallon size bag to preschool in case he has an accident in his clothes and they can put the soiled clothes in the bag!
 Jennifer Y. 
When I have to grease a pan, I put a sandwich-sized bag over my hand before dipping my hand in the butter. That way your hand stays clean!
 Lou-Ann 
When we go canoeing we like to take our Canon T1i digital camera to take photos of the wildlife and scenery. We always put it in a gallon Ziplock just in case it begins to rain, get splashed or if we capsize (Heaven forbid) This not only keeps the camera dry but it floats and can be quickly retrieved.
 Julie 
To store receipts so they don’t get lost or damaged.
 Mary H 
I use the ziploc bags constantly.
The snack bags are perfect for small adds to my daughters lunches and snacks.

the small pieces to games so they don’t get lost

We use the quart size to hold the puzzle pieces in the puzzle boxes.

The gallons hold the separated meats when I buy in bulk

These are just a few uses, I use them daily and for so many things can’t even think of them all.
 Ann J 
I use the freezer size Ziplocs for storing sweet corn in the refrigerator after I have peeled it and it stays fresh for at least a week.

I also use the sandwich size for holding my car registration and proof of insurance, so if I would ever need it, I just grab the bag from the glovebox.
 Jennifer 
Here are some of the things we do with our Ziploc bags:

Organize craft supplies: beads, clasps, etc., can each go in its own small bag and all the small bags can go into a larger bag or container.

Freeze extra broth or sauce for later use.

Store pasta.

Store dehydrated fruits and vegetables.

Organize screws, nuts, washers, etc. in the garage.

There are so many uses, I’m sure I have left some out.

I use Ziploc bags to store my film canisters when traveling by plane. I can take the Ziplocs out of my bag for hand inspection by airport screeners without having to put it through the X-ray machine.
 Karen 
To do my part in keeping parks and areas where I walk my dogs clean, I always carry the small to regular size ziplocs in my car in case ,y dogs have to go poo. I grab the bottom of the bag, pick up the pooh and zip it shut–my hands are protected and no odor!
 Kathy 
There are sooo many uses for ziplock bags.
My favorite is–Making slushes- take a package of Koolaid. Make it with only 1/2 sugar. Put in gallon size Freezer Ziplock till it looks frozen but not frozen solid (about 1-2 hours). Take out and depending on how frozen either shake really hard or break by wiggling bag. (kids love that part) Devide in cups or cones. Enjoy!!

My billfold was so full of reward cards that I could barely find my money. Now I carry them in a sandwich size Ziploc bag in my purse, easy to find them…and my money!

 Melanie Edman-Osmer 
When moving, it is amazing how many things can be taken apart to fit better in a moving van! When I was moving, I stored all of the nuts and bolts (or even power cords and cables) from each item in their own Ziploc bag, labeled the bag and then, using packing tape, taped the Ziploc back to the item. Works great, too, when keeping items in storage!
 Gina 
I use the ziploc bags to store matches/lighter and tea lights candles and put them in emergency places throught my home and in vehicles.

I also use them as small emergency kits throught the house and in vehicles. (bandaids, Qtips, alcohol pads, allergy pills, pain medicine and whatever will fit)

We also use them in the car to store napkins/tissue/paper towels neatly in the glove box. You can fold them up into and they fit without taking up a lot of room.
 Tommy John 
I like to fill a Ziplock with water and freeze it. I use this to cool my lunch bag for when I go to work.
 Jenny 
I love using the ziploc freezer bags as decorator bags for icing. I just snip off the tip and insert the decorator tip then the icing and zip it shut. Works great to keep it neater, and is especially great when kids are helping. However, I’m pretty messy too, so I’m grateful for the zip. :-)

Can never have enough!

#21–great idea…I send a number of boxes to the family and friends around the world and never thought of using a Ziploc as a bubble wrap by inflating it with a straw. I am definitely going to need to do this around the holidays…thanks Ziploc.

 Tonya 
Store miscellaneous parts or leftover parts (e.g., a screw for an appliance or a little wrench that came with a some assembly required item) in the bag with a small piece of paper indicating what the part is for.
 Rosa C. 
I use the gallon sized Ziploc bags when I pack for a trip. Just fold your clothes, place them in a Ziploc, squeeze out the extra air (I usually roll the bag from the bottom), and seal it. Voila! You now have a vacuum sealed bag, thus creating more space in your luggage as well as keeping your clothes dry. I also put dirty clothes in Ziplocs, squeeze out the air, and seal the bags. Thus, the dirty clothes don’t contaminate the clean ones.
 Nicole Pulliam 
My favorite thing to do with ziplocs is to use them to prevent the loss of puzzle pieces and game pieces. Oh if only I had thought of that years ago. I’ve thrown away nice puzzles and games because they were missing enough pieces to render them useless.

Now when we get a new item, it is immediately labeled and bagged. We put the game instructions into bag of pieces etc and then we store the bag itself in the game box with the playing boards.

Saves time, saves aggravation and definitely saves money.
 Sara 
I use Ziplock to store puzzle pieces, too. I also use them for storing pasta and keeping bread dough in the freezer. I also use them for freezing soups and other hotdishes. I love using them!
 Jennifer Burden 
I use Ziplocs for all kinds of storage, including craft supplies, that I want to keep from leaking and making messes. Used ziplocs that are no longer“sterile”for storing food are re-used to store fingerpaints, markers, chalk, etc. and even kept as back-up mess holders in the car, diaper bag, and backpacks.

Any time I open a bag of frozen veggies, I slip a bit into a Ziplock that I keep in the freezer. When I need it, I have a great bag of mixed veggies for winter soups and stews.
 http://www.allthingsalicia.typepad.com Alicia 
I like to cook some things in large batches and freeze them. Ziplocs bags work great because the items you’re freezing can redistribute into a flat like shape, making it easy to stack several more items in a freezer. My tip, when trying to put something liquid like spagetti sauce or chili in a Ziploc to freeze, use a tall cup to make it easier to get the food into the bag. I stick my bag inside a cup, then fold opening of the bag over the edge of the cup, pour in my sauce, and pull it out. The result is a nice clean bag with a no hassle filling ready to seal and put in my freezer.
 Elizabeth 
I use Ziplocs to marinate meat. Sometimes I will even prep the marinade, put in the raw meat, and then throw it in the freezer. That way, on a day that I don’t feel like cooking, I pull out the bag in the morning and it’s ready to be cooked by the afternoon. Thawing, and marinating all at the same time.
 ann 
I use ziplock for dirty messes instead of rubber gloves, saves cleaning the gloves and helps with sanitation and infection for real dirty jobs
 Angela 
I like using Ziploc bags to marinate meats in the freezer.Also for storing meals made ahead in the freezer. Also for slicing individual pieces of cake to take to work to share.

Living in Oregon, I have definitely adopted the umbrella-in-a-Ziploc trick! My umbrella is small enough to fit in my purse and the Ziploc protects everything in there from getting wet :-)
 bethani 
we use ziplocs to keep toys and games organized in the car on road trips.

When I go kayaking I put my camera in a quart size Ziploc bag, then blow it up to full capacity. This allows it to float. That way if I roll my boat, my camera stays dry and retrievable.
 Fibia 
I use Ziploc bags for my daughter’s hair accessories. That way, they are not all over her room.

We always put our daily pills in Ziplock snack size bags when we travel; our 3oz or under items for flying are in the Ziplock gallon size bags; use Ziplock bags of various sizes in our pantry to prevent those pesky“pantry flies”. The grandkids use the sandwick size Ziploc bags for their Silly Banz! Couldn’t live without them–terrific.
 Joel D. 
I’m a book collector, and whenever I hunt for“treasures”in thrift shops or used book stores, I bring along several bags to preserve my finds. I love the ease of labeling so I can place pertinent info on the bag and not have to open the book unless absolutely necessary.
 Jim 
I like #15–When there’s a boo-boo, break out a Ziploc sandwich bag and fill it with ice.
 Becky 
I am a member of a produce co-op and after I pick up my produce I like to spend time preping the vegetables for easy use during the week. I then store them in ziploc bags to keep them fresh for the rest of the week.
 romy 
I use ziplock bags all of the time. Lately I’ve been using the gallon size bag it to store my phone, sunglasses&amp;camera when going to the beach so sand doesn’t get into it.
I also use it to store a change of clothes for the kids. Once they’re done playing I replace the clean clothes with wet swimming suits so they don’t get the bag wet.

Ziploc omelets for a crowd:

# Have guests write their name on a quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker. shopping list
# Crack 2 eggs (large or extra-large) into the bag (not more than 2) shake to combine them. shopping list
# Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheeses, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, hash browns, salsa, etc. shopping list
# Each guest adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake. Make sure to get the air out of the bag and zip it up. shopping list
# Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for exactly 13 minutes. You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot. For more, make another pot of boiling water. shopping list
# Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily. Be prepared for everyone to be amazed.
 Kimberlee 
We use Ziploc containers when we make a large batch of spaghetti. After dinner, we divide the rest into individual portions and freeze them. It’s great for quick meals. You can just microwave them warm and enjoy later!
 http://www.booksforme.xanga.com Caroline 
I cannot imagine life without Ziploc. Really. Of the ideas above, I love to use them to marinate meat. I put the meat in the bag with the marinade, and then freeze it. When it’s time to defrost, the meat is already marinading as it defrosts.

Something I do which I did not see here, is use them to store scarves. It keeps them clean, neat, and protected. I also use them to protect my vintage linens. Large bags are perfect for paper plates, napkins, and disposable flatware kits that I take on the road when I travel. I’ll also use them to make my own handy wipes, by putting a stack of paper towels in a bag with enough water to moisten them through. LOVE that on the road. I even did this once with bleach spray, to sanitize porta-potties when we went to a music festival. What a lifesaver that was, too!

Ziploc bags are the best!
 Beege 
When we travel we pack certain items in Ziploc bags and place them in our suitcase or in the car. Road trips require Family Bathroom Bag (toiletries for all), medicine bag, snack bag, entertainment bag (toys, games, books), map bag and an overnight emergency bag (change of underwear and some clothes). If we fly we pack lotions, soap, shampoo and toothpaste in a Ziploc so if the suitcase gets squished these items are not all over our clothing. Underwear, socks, camisoles and such will get bagged also.
 Ryan 
I also use Ziploc bags for travel. I put my toothbrush and other toiletries in them. But don’t forget to take extras for the trip home! That way you toothbrush will always stay germ free.
 Elizabeth 
Ziploc bags help me keep my seed collection organized. The paper packets in which the seeds come, and any extra seeds i save from the plants all go into the bags along with a paper with information about the seeds. That way I can keep track of my seeds and they dont get mixed.
 http://www.eatingkorean.com Cecilia 
My favorite is #19. Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool!

I do that all the time for cakes and cupcakes. Sometimes I put the little shaped tips in, too, to make it even more fun. Which reminds, me I think I have some cupcakes to bake today! :)
 http://www.daybydaysavings.blogspot.com Kim 
I like to marinate my meat in ziploc bags.
 Lorna 
I put one boneless skinless chicken breast in a Ziploc sandwich bag, squeeze out all the air, and then put all the bagged chicken in a Ziploc freezer bag, and freeze. The chicken doesn’t get freezer burn, and it’s easy to count out the quantity needed for dinner.
 Lisa Richardson 
I use ziplock baggies to store seeds at the end of the growing season. I can see the seeds inside the baggy, as well as write on the outside so I know the type and date. Plus, they don’t spill, and they are easy to store.
 Lisa 
I have many, many uses for my Ziploc bags. But probably the best use is at work–an elementary school. During the day, children lose all kinds of things, from barrettes to buttons. Put‘em in a Ziploc bag, put the student name on it, and at the end of the day pass them out to put in backpacks to take home. This also works well with soiled clothing at school (spilled milk, bathroom accident).
 Kerri 
I count out medications for my family and take just enough when going away for a weekend. No chance to lose the whole prescription when traveling.
 Laura Knisely 
I like to portion out meat after I get back from the grocery store. That way I just have to thaw out one bag instead of the whole thing-and I save money that way!!
 Brooke 
I like to put Legos by color in the ziplocs so that the kids can find them better.
 Charlotte 
We use ziploc bags to keep playing cards neat in board games. We can play the games immediately instead of beginning the game by organizing the loose cards. Plus the kids like knowing that when the put the cards away in the ziploc bag that the game will be ready to play the next time.
 http://naddezsgoodycorner.blogspot.com Quanda 
I buy family sized meat (i.e. hamburger, chicken, pork chops) divide the meat by servings and use separate Ziploc bags to freeze the (proportional) meat.
 Sandy Newport 
My favorite use for ziplocks when traveling is for snacks and dog food.
I buy the large size cookies, crackers, etc. and put a few in bags and put the bags back in the container or a larger bag. No more stale food and it even works with chips if you use a hard ziplock container with a lid. So much easier than passing an open bag in a car full of kids ;) We keep the empty bags for garbage if we stop at a fast food restaurant and don’t go inside. Keeps any left over food contained and not on the floor of the van.
For the dogs I put one serving in a ziplock, put their dish and enough bags for the trip in a larger bag. No mess, and if the dogs need meds I can put it in the bag and not miss a dose.
 Casey Tanksley 
I like to freeze okra in quart ziploc bags to have for the winter. I also like to freeze blueberries in quart ziploc bags to make blueberry cobbler. I also use the large ziploc bags for cell phones and wallets when out on the lake for water proofing.
 Julie Foreman 
I bring gallon size empty bags with me to the beach for wet stuff when we are all done.
 Elizabeth 
I’m always using ziploc bags. When any necklaces breaks I put the beads in a ziplock and store the beads for future craft projects.

I also use them to store food in the freezer, including fruit and marinated meat. And of course I use them to store leftovers.

When traveling, they are not only good to store liquids but you can use them to store any important documents or your journal, to keep them waterproof.
 Michele 
As a teacher, I use them daily. I put sets of math manipulatives in the gallon size. I put sets of spelling words, etc in the sandwich size. The snack size are great for storing all the little stuff- erasers, paper clips, game pieces. I’m looking for a place to buy the larger size bags, ie. 3 gallon and bigger.
 nancy fields 
I put a couple of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies into each ziplock bag and put them in the freezer. That way I can take out“just enough”for a treat, and not too much to ruin my diet!
 Lauren S. 
I make large batches of soup, chili, or pasta sauce and store whatever I don’t eat that night in quart-size Ziplocs. I take a large coffee mug and put the Ziploc inside, flipping the top of the bag over the lip of the mug. I then fill the mug up with sauce/soup then zip up the bag. This is especially great for soups since a mug is a perfect single serving. The ziplocs can then be stacked on top of each other in the fridge or freezer–its very space-efficient! A single bag thaws easily on the counter or in the fridge, and is easy to bring to work for lunch.
 http://alice.com Trish 
I use ziploc bags when I clean out the litter box. that way the“mess”is sealed in ziploc bag, then in the trash bag. Double bagging keeps the place fresh.
 Angie 
I put my leftover chicken stock in a large ziplock, lay it flat on a cookie sheet and place it in the freezer. It’s flat and thin and doesn’t take up much room.
 Jessica 
We use Ziploc bags for lots of things. My son makes frozen yogurt by putting plain yogurt, honey, and fresh fruit in a Ziploc and smooshing it around in the bag. Then pop it in the freezer. Yummy!
 Cheryl 
After enjoying success this year with my first garden, I decided to freeze my onions, carrots, green peppers and chives. I sliced or diced each vegetable, then measured out 1/2 cup‘servings’to put into snack size ziploc baggies. I used a straw to remove the extra air in each baggie, then put all the 1/2 cup serving baggies into gallon-sized Ziploc Vacuum bags. When I need these vegetables for a recipe, I simply remove a 1/2 cup baggie or two, then re-seal the vacuum bag, vacuum pump the air out, and toss the remainder back in my freezer.
 Irona Deranger 
Know how hard it is to clean the dust off of artificial flowers and plants? Perfect solution is here! Put them in a large Zip-Lock bag with about 1/4-1/2 cup of salt, depending on the size of the item, and shake, shake, shake it up. SO easy and comes out like new again!
 Stephanie 
Put a wet wash cloth in a ziplock in your diaper bag. It’s better than baby wipes and more green!
 joelle 
I buy healthy snacks in bulk such as pretzels and crackers and portion them out into single serving sizes using ziplock bags.. great to grab on the way to work or out running errands
 Kelly D. 
I use ziploc bags to make ready to go snack bags. When I buy a bag of chips, pretzels, carrots, grapes, etc. I put them into single servings and store them that way so that when I do want to eat them I don’t go crazy and an entire package of food! Saves me calories, time at the gym, and money.
 Diane 
I like to use them to bread catfish. Rather than dredging them through the breading, I just toss them in a Ziploc with the breading in it, close and shake. It works really good.
 Shelby Burkett 
Alice,

I like to put my small quilt pieces, label them and put them in a ziplock bag.

Shelby Burkett
 http://alice.com Renee Petrungaro 
I have always used ziplock, from the sandwich bags to the containers that I could put in the freezer. But when they came out with the x-large ziplock bags they won my heart over again ! Those bags are perfect for going to beach, putting toys in, storing all my extra blankets, and keep my quilting material free from dust.
 JC Chen 
I use ziplock bags to keep my jeweries, they are good help to organize my personal stuffs.
 Randi 
They’re good for packing items in a suitcase. Security at the airport can see what’s in the bag without having to pull everything out.
 Byron Carasco 
I like putting my iPhone in a Ziploc bag before going camping. It keeps it nice and safe from scratches and water damage, and you can still use the touchscreen (not that you’ll have service)!
 Joy Cannon 
I like to cook up a big batch of dried beans and freeze whatever I don’t need immediately in quart-sized Ziplocs. They’re flat and take up little precious freezer space, and I have components for quick, easy meals on hand.
 Victoria Walden 
I work with kids at school and in a child development center. Looking for something easy to do with them for a cooking project. I found out that we could mix eggs in bowl and put them in a Ziploc back, not the one with the zipper, the orginal one. You can add separate ingredients for each child in each bag. You can put the bags in the microwave and make an easy omelet with them.
 Paras Wadehra 
I like using Ziploc bags to store spices. I also use them for leftovers and for putting toiletries in for trips.
 lolaphong 
This may be too practical–when my ankle bothers me I load a ziplock sandwich bag with ice and
rest this on my ankle or any other joint that bothers me.
 Laura 
I mostly use them for all the fresh fruits I get on sale. I cut them up into bite size pieces and freeze them for later. We can use them as ice cubes, in smoothies, or for snacking.

They also work great in the 72hour kit. Similar to the traveling tips–keeping it all dry and separated if anything gets wet, the first aid kit, toiletries, etc…

What would we do without Ziplock?
 Candi Curtis 
When we go camping we love to eat food! Our favorite so far was when we cut up chicken into chunks and stored in a ziplock bag, then we put flour into a separate one gallon sized ziplock bag. At the campsite we transferred the chicken to the four bag and shook. Then fried in a pan with oil. Let the chicken drain on a paper towel, transfer to another ziplock bag and add your favorite Chinese sause from a bottle, Kung Pao, General Tsao’s, Orange or Seet and Sour. Shake the Chicken with the sause and you now have Chinese chicken! Mmmm. Make some white rice on the side and you’ll have a meal! YUM
 http://purpleambrosia@yahoo.com Jennie 
When the kids were young and traveled often, I would put each days clothes in a bag.
They had their shirt, pants/shorts, socks, underwear, hair accessories etc. all matched and together in one bag..
When they got up–they picked a bag–they could see everything and put it on.
Easy for me, easy for them and we knew if we had everything we needed to pack. When the day was over, the dirty clothes went back in the bag. It was so easy to pack for a trip across country.
 Bill Greene 
I use them camping. Break the eggs before you go, make the scrambled egg mix or omelette before you go and put it in the freezer bag, pack it in the cooler and it’s good to go. Light, portable, and no longer fragile. Also good for pancake batter.
 Virginia 
I like to use them to keep a mini first aid kit in the car. Everything you need fits in a Ziploc bag. First aid cream, plastic bandages, even alcohol swabs fit in a small ziploc.
 Alicia Day 
I use them for my lunch every weekday, but I also like to use them to keep coupons for my trip to the grocery store.
 Lauren 
I’m amazed by all the uses I never thought about before. I have two favorites that weren’t mentioned yet–when camping, I pack each day’s worth of clothes in its own Ziploc. Everything stays clean and dry even if your duffel ends up spilling out. I knit–often outside of my home–so I keep a bunch of necessities (needles, tape measure, small scissor, etc.) in a small Ziploc, which I then throw into my knitting bag with my current project and I’m ready to go.
 Judy S 
When traveling we used the largest ziploc available for hand washing. Then it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a sink that holds water plus you can“agitate”your laundry any way you want-shake, squeeze, knead and the delicate items are still protected.
 SH Pang 
I love gardening. After each summer season, I clear my spring blossoms flower bed and keep the seeds for the next season. I love storing these FLOWER SEEDS in the transparent Ziploc. Label it with marker for easy reference.
 Esther 
They’re great as emergency“potty”for my 3 year old guy. Zip, pee, and loc. Better than against a tree….
 Wanda Kain 
I use Ziplock bags for just about everything that I store in the frig and use the freezer bags putting up vegetables from my garden in the summer. When traveling I use them to put breakable items or items that spill into them. They are great for just about anything you need to store.
 Alan Segal 
I keep manuals and receipts (and extra hardware) together in a Ziploc bag.

I move a lot, and I have learned to put silverware, a few dishes, and a pot/pan, medicine, toiletries, and clean clothes for a few days in Ziploc bags. This keeps them clean and easy to spot. That way when I get to my destination, I don’t have to rewash already clean items.
 Nathan 
I have some equipment that I haul around from time to time. The unites are made to be portable, but require some reassembly with a few nuts&amp;bolts&amp;such. I keep the hardware for each unit in a separate labeled Ziploc bag along with basic instructions (in case someone besides me is setting up the gear). Spare parts are in another bag.

I also use a freezer bag for telescope parts (eyepieces, etc) when traveling out to the field. Being able to see through the bag to see what I’m grabbing for is quite helpful. I’ll often put a bag over the alignment scope or the“business”end of the telescope to keep dust and condensation off, as the lens caps were lost some time ago.
 sheri 
We use Ziplocs at our preschool for lots of things, but my favorite is lining our paint cups with sandwich size bags. Then, we snap the paint cup lid on top, and the brush drops right in. At the end of the day, we take the brush out and zip up the bags so we can use the leftover paint on the next school day.

We use gallon size bags to store a change of clothes for each child–and if something gets soiled, we send it home in a ziploc.
 http://Alice L. Thomas 
This is an entry for the Ziploc giveaway. I liked suggestion #13. Thank you.

I use Ziploc gallon bags to hold pattern pieces. It is impossible to fold up an open clothing pattern and fit it back into the envelope, so I put them in a Ziploc bag along with the envelope. I also keep small pieces of cloth I have cut out for a craft or quilt project in bags to keep them together.
 Sharon 
Instead of wrapping leftover coffeecake or cookies that comes in a tray with that awful plastic wrap that I always have to fight with to get it straight, I pop the whole tray into a large storage bag, zip it up and it stays fresh untill next time. The bag can be reused then because it only has a few crumbs inside which can be removed.
 http://www.crumbsfromhistable.com christina 
I knit and crochet, and Ziplocs are great for keeping pattern, yarn, and notions together, clean, and dry. They can stay zipped when I’m not working, and when I’m ready for the project again I can take out the hook/needles and work in progress and mostly rezip the bag. The yarn can feed through the opening, but the rest of the ball stays clean and doesn’t roll on the floor or under the couch.
 Christine 
I make baby food for my daughter, freeze in little blobs and then store in Ziploc bags in the freezer. Easy to take out only what I need.
 Lu Han 
My favorite existing tip on that list is #13.

My personal use for zip loc is to bring single serving cereal portions with me to work, so I don’t eat the whole box. :)
 Kim Burdette 
I use the HUGE large storage bags to store my out of season clothing under my bed
 http://jenniferpruitt.scentsy.us Jennifer 
I purchase ground hamburger in the large quanity packaging to save money then package them in one pound packages in the Ziploc quart size freezer bags. I press out the air and a press them down flat so they stack flat and also when I defrost them they defrost faster then bigger balled up pounds.
 Rob Serini 
I love using the Ziploc bags as electronic gadget umbrellas. We live in NV were it hardly rains and traveled to Disney World. We put our digital camera and cell phones in individual Ziploc baggies because we never knew when the next thunderstorm would blow in with rain falling sideways! And we still got some great photos from inside the bag!
 Sherry 
We use the freezer bags to boil omelets and sandwich size to carry toiletries.
 Paul K 
I use My Freezer ZipLock Bags for just about every comment posted. The two biggest uses is to pour my coffee beans into a ZipLock and place that bag back inside of the coffee container for that extra flavor protection.

The second biggest use is that we are a non smoking house hold, but i leave an ash tray on my porch ledge for guests that have to smoke outside. after emptying the astray i place it inside of a Ziplock and dont have to smell the tar and nicotine when i walk up to my door.
 Angela 
We love ziploc bags for storing parts and pieces of the kid’s toys. My favorite by far are the containers with screw-on lids…no chance of a spill when they get nocked over!
 Cheryl Rojo 
I like the idea of using it as bubble wrap. Great hints and ideas!!
 http://Alice.com Grayce Goin 
When moving I use lots of zip locks–from the packing to keep anything that might leak from spreading to keeping pieces of things together–anything from nuts and bolts from furniture to cables for electronic equipment. I put the pieces in a zip lock back and then tape the bag to the item it attaches to. No more boxes of loose cables or mixed up bolts and screws.
 Karen Woodby 
I keep my underclothes together inside suitcases with Ziploc zipper bags. I use the bigger ones for my shoes when I travel. I never leave the house without storing things that could break or spill in a bag inside my suitcase. I learned the best trick from my mother, years ago, when we took long and day-trips: put a wet washcloth in a zip bag for quick clean ups and peanut butter crackers in another. It was always smooth traveling with her!
 Nell Eda 
I make pumpkin pie filling, place it in a one gallon Ziploc bag and freeze. When I am ready to bake a pie place the bag in the refrigerator to thaw, make pie crust and fill by opening one corner of the Ziploc bag and pouring filling in. Bake as usual.
 http://www.ourfrugalhappylife.blogspot.com Emily @ Our Frugal Happy Life 
I love using Ziploc freezer bags for my freezer cooking!
 Millie Guth 
Whenever I open a can of beans, soup, Franco American, fruit in juice…..anything that has liquid and I don’t eat all the contents I always encase the entire can in a Ziplock bag. No labeling required as I can see at a glance what my leftover is!!!
 Joyce 
Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool!
 Chanh Kha 
I use my ziploc bag to separate family pack chicken and beef so I would be able to unfreeze the right amount I need that night!
 http://www.fondandfurrymemories.com Elaine Cruz 
I use large ziploc bags to protect treasured memories in the memory books I create for my clients. They work great!
 Adrienne S. 
I like the tip of storing manuals + extra parts in their own ziplock…so smart…no more hunting around for the right screw when you need to replace one.
 Eunice Wong 
Ziplock bags is my big kitchen helper. I marinate meat, brine whole flyer, separate raw meat for freezing, organize my fridge etc. It’s space saver and very convenient.
 Lynn 
Throw a couple of empty bags in the cooler when heading out to the ball field. Almost always someone will get hit or bruised somehow&amp;need an ice pack. Rather than buy the expensive“instant”cold packs, just reach in the cooler, get some ice cubs&amp;put in the ziplock bag. Then apply to bruise! :^)
 http://hypnoticsolutionsohio.com Margaret Arthur 
My favorite tip is #27. I do this in order to protect my camera when it rains or when swimming or at the amusement park.

I also like this one…I do a variation of #19, by using a Ziploc Baggie to squeeze the yolk into the shells when I make deviled eggs.
 http://Alice.com Gloria Borst 
I take a lot of prescription medicines. When I travel, I put all the bottles in a large Ziplock bag. Then they can fill it into odd spots in my carry-on bag. They always say to have the original bottles, so this works out great.
 http://ALICE Laura 
I have probably used a ziploc for almost everything on the list and dozens more. I particularly like breaking down a large quantity of food into real portions. It helps me control what I am eating, especially of‘bad’foods like nuts where its so easy to keep dipping in. I use it in house painting both for lining a small jar so I can carry the paint around easily to storing the sponge brushes afterwards. And for traveling, there’s always a few extra. It helps to roundup the souvenir papers and keep things neat for the trip home.
 Amy 
When I’m traveling, I put all of my medications in a Ziploc–easier than bringing tons of medicine bottles with me!
 D VH 
Fresh fruit! so much healthier than what I normally eat.
 cjs 
I put all my chip clips in a quart size Ziploc bag so they don’t get‘lost’in my kitchen drawer.
 Tammilee 
I use Ziploc for camera cords and appliance pieces that are extras. I have a file drawer that has the manuals and any chargers, cords or pieces that go with the item in it. It makes it a lot easier to find everything.
 http://Alice.com Gloria Borst 
I take a lot of prescription medicines. When I travel, I put all the filled prescription bottles in a large Ziplock bag. Then I can fit it into odd spots in my carry-on bag. They always say to have the original bottles when you travel, so this works out great.
 Diana Baker 
My son plays baseball, for those really hot days at the ball park. I take a wet washcloth or a hand towel, put in a ziplock and stash in the cooler. After the game he can put around his neck to cool off.
 Janet 
I buy regular sized bags of snacks, cookies and crackers and immediately break them down into servings using Ziploc snack bags to make it easy to grab a baggie on the go and to keep the portion size under control.
 Judy 
I love to prep fresh veggies, label the bag (and amount), freeze and enjoy year round. Right now i am grating cucumbers for Jello salads to enjoy until next summer.
 http://brilliantdisguise.blogspot.com Julia 
Whenever I’m chopping onions or other veggies for dinner, I always chop extra and store in a Ziploc in the fridge. Makes the next night’s dinner prep that much faster.
 Megan 
I use ziplock bags for travel and marinating meats and veggies.
 Michelle 
I put fresh cookies in them right after they cool a little from the oven. Six in each ziplock and they go in my husbands lunch and stay nice and soft.
 SaraAlexys 
I actually already use ziploc bags most of the ways listed. I love them! I buy cases on them in bulk to take oatmeal and fruit to work daily as well as pack snacks. toiletries ,and jewelry for the many trips I take. I think my favorite tip is #7. I never thought of using ziploc bags to keep my feet dry, but it’s an awesome idea!!
 Jasmine 
Love the frosting piping tip…I always use a ziplock to pipe frosting on cupcakes!! yum! I want a cupcake now
 HT 
I like to use it to make my own chocolate candies. I fill a“zippie”half full with chocolate chips and let it sit in hot water for up to ten minutes. I then cut a very small hole in the corner to pipe the melted chocolate onto wax paper in various shapes–usually hearts. I stick them in the fridge to harden and when they are ready, they peel right off! I’ve used them as cake accents and gifts for my family. Or to simply kill some time with an edible craft.
 Jennifer 
I like to buy meat in bulk and make a large batch of marinade. I can fill a number of bags with meat and marinade and stack them in the freezer. All I have to do is pop the bag out of the freezer. When I come home in the evening, the meat is marinated and ready to go.
 Sarah 
I think I’ve done just about all of these. I really like using Ziplocs for organization: manuals + cords + extra bits = getting to throw out the rest of the packaging! (easy to add in a cut out UPC code or other pieces). With the label band on the freezer bags, that is easily taken care of too. Now that Lego boxes don’t really reclose, we do the same thing with Lego sets; the snack size work great for extra pieces when we leave something set up, or to keep specialty pieces together when putting a set away.
 Bobby K 
I love to travel&amp;my shampoos always leak so I put all my toiletries in zip lock bags. The small amounts allowed in carry-ons are not enough but I can put the zip lock bags in my check in bag and don’t have to worry about spills and leaks.
 Nicole M 
The man of the house won’t eat cookies after the first day unless they’re in a ziploc–he swears they get stale after just a few hours! So whether it be homemade chocolate chip or Oreos, they always end up in a baggie.
 Melissa 
Whenever I grill chicken, I make extra. I chop it up and put it in a Ziploc Freezer bag, label the bag, and put it in the freezer. Next time we’re having something like Chicken Quesadillas or Chicken Salad, it’s a quick meal prep. All I have to do is get out the amount of chicken I need and thaw. Plus there’s one less time of cleaning up the grill!
 heather norcross 
I think helping to keep on our diet. Perfect baggies for snacks.

I love this tip and plan to follow it: . Put all your spare keys in little Ziploc bags and label them so you don’t lose your head when you lose your keys!
 Tina Henry 
So many great ideas, it’s hard to choose just one favorite. I’d have to say, though, that making your own bubble wrap is pretty ingenious!
 Krystal Brown 
I liked using it as a diaper changing mat then you can put the stinky diaper in and toss it!
 Julie Richer 
My husband and I have oatmeal for breakfast, and make ours healthy by starting with plain oats and adding whatever we each prefer–cinnamon, almond slivers, flaxseed, dried fruit/ raisins, etc. When traveling I fill snack-sized Ziploc bags with an individual serving of oatmeal mix for each of us for each morning, then put the individual bags into a larger Ziploc marked with the correct name. If milk will not be available at our destination, dried milk can be added as well. This makes for a hearty, easy breakfast each morning of our trip without expense or bother. The little Ziplocs could also be taken to work for a quick breakfast or lunch.
 Laura 
I always use a Ziploc bag to marinate meat. It’s easy to make sure the marinade completely coats the meat if you just put it all in a bag and give it a good shake!
 susan 
I make seasoned bread crumbs in a large bowl fo rmy chicken culets receipe and divide it up to use several times in the future
 Angel 
I love to use the freezer bags for our yearly New Mexico green chili. They are great….and keep our chili fresh tasting till the next year. :)
 Karen Anderson 
I marinate meats in Ziplock bags before I BBQ and then use Ziplock bags for any leftovers. Love them!
 Jacquie 
I have used my Ziploc freezer bags to marinate a variety of meats for grilling/baking. I use Ziploc storage containers to put leftover food in; such as gravy and veggies. I also use Ziploc bags to store flour/corn meal after the packages are opened to keep the spill contained on the inside of the baggie.

I love using Ziploc bags to freeze in season produce to enjoy year round. I also freeze meats in them too…get it cheaper by buying larger portions then put it in Ziploc.
 Barbara Siminitis 
When friends and family come, i send goodies home with them in Ziplock bags, then I don’t have to worry about them returning my containers. Ziplock can hold spaghetti and sauce without leaking. I also use them to carry treats for our yellow lab
 Tami Proctor 
I always use Ziploc bags for marinating–especially big slabs of ribs overnight.
One of my favorite uses though is when I am painting, large or small, I keep a ziploc around to slip my brush in if I get called away. I just put the brush part in, and zip it up around the handle. This keeps the brush from drying out and anything from accidentally getting painted!
 April 
Not that this is the most original, but it’s so great to store fruit in the freezer…fruit all year long and it tastes better than canned.
 Barb Woods 
I’m a Grandma and like to make cookies and divide them up in Ziploc bags for each of the grandkids
 Joan Cavanaugh 
My favorite use is to fill with air when shipping overseas so nothing will break. Once package is opened friends can use the bags!!! They are very expensive in Brazil!!
 Helen 
We use them for everything! Among favorite uses: 1) separate bags for colored pencils, crayons and markers when traveling, to easily stash them in a handbag, 2) keeping handballs and tennis balls in school backpacks, 3) toothbrushes and toothpaste kits for the kids when we travel, 4) individual bags of assorted snacks, 5) all-in-one-bag of card games (deck of cards, dice, small pencil and small pad of paper)…love them!
 Nicole 
My favorite is 13. Love marinating meat in ziploc bags. Never leaks.
 http://www.cinemacupcakes.com Jennifer 
I use Ziploc bags to hold my scentsy bricks. My mom and I share the bricks, so we divide them up in ziploc bags. They keep the fragrance fresh.
 Marilyn 
I always use a Ziploc bag when I’m marinating meat…no mess!
 Charlotte 
I use the largest ziplock bags in my scrapbook room to keep scraps of paper and cardstock in colors seperated and I use the snack size bags to put embellishments in for a scrapbook page I am working on. I use the ziploc bowls to keep flowers and ribbon in.
 christine 
When traveling I always take a cooler along with my own drinks so the fast food bill is a little easier to pay. I always make my own ice and pack it in Ziploc bags. The ice stays frozen longer.
 Casey Casebeer 
I work in US embassies in Africa. I keep my boarding passes, taxi receipts, itinerary, and travel advance paperwork together in a gallon size Ziplock bag (the perfect size for a thick sheaf of standard A4 or 8 1/2 x 11″paper) until I’m ready to process a travel voucher. Then I keep copies of processed vouchers, with the date and destination written on the bag. My vouchers are easy to sort, don’t get crumpled, and pack easily when I’m on a long assignment overseas. And I haven’t lost a receipt since I started using Ziplock bags!
 http://alice.com Lynn 
I use the Ziploc storage containers to sort my pieces of glass and ceramics by color for mosaic projects
 Sarah 
I use Zip-Lock bags to keep snacks handy in my purse for my young daughter. I also keep a couple in her diaper bag for solided clothing or cloth diapers.
They also come in handy for keeping her hair bows in order.
 http://www.communityguy.com Jake McKee 
I use ziplocs to sort my collection of LEGO bricks!
 Amy 
I love to marinate meat in ziploc bags. They don’t leak and you can throw the mess away!
 JoAnn A. 
When traveling by airplane or somewhere there is a high elevation, I put my shampoo, conditioner and any other toiletry that might explode in ziplock bags so that if that does occur it won’t go all over my bag or anything else that is in the bag.
 Jen R. 
7. Winter is coming! Do you have leaky boots? Put on warm socks, slip your feet into Ziploc’s storage bags and then slide on your boots.–My feet always get wet! Love this idea!
 Taryn 
I love to use small ziplock bags for dispensing condiments like sour cream or yogurt. I don’t dirty any little containers, and I can just snip off the end and squeeze onto my lunch. Perfect!
 Erica 
We use tons of Ziplocs in our playroom! Puzzle pieces, flash cards, crayons, markers, other game pieces and so much more! I label the bags so the kids know exactly what goes where!
 Amanda 
I have used Ziploc bags of all sizes for a little bit of everything. I have even used them to pick up my doggies messes :)
 Harvey 
The Ziploc snack bags are ideal for storing dried herbs.
 Jess 
#13, we always marinate our meat in Ziplocks!
 Emma 
Marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready.
 Gina 
I used the 2 1/2 gallon ziplocs this summer to put my son’s clothes in for each day of summer camp. Each day gets its own ziploc.Clean clothes come out each day and the dirty ones go in the now empty bag. This kept his trunk organized and much less smelly by the end of the week.
 Gerry Everson 
Ziplock bags are the best and I mean only ziplock bags. I use them all the time and for almost all the reasons above. But I have finally got my husband to use them for the cords and extra pieces for the different phones, computers, printers, cameras, and anything that has parts. It works great with a label right on the outside he never has to look far for the things he needs.
 Casey Casebeer 
When traveling I always have two Extra Large Ziplock bags and a few smaller ones in my carry-on. They weigh nothing and are good for so many things. A bulky, warm sweatshirt will pack much smaller if you roll it in a big Ziplock, squeezing out air as you go, and then zip it closed. If one of your luggage bags blows out you can put stuff in one XL bag, press out the air and zip it, and then put this in the second bag, press out the air and zip it. (I have even checked things wrapped this way and labeled with an indelible marker.) Also, I carry a Ziplock with a basic kit of salt, pepper, spices, sugar or artificial sweetener, ketchup packets, peanut butter packets, dry milk or creamer, dry fruit, nuts, napkins and plastic spoons wherever I travel. If you fly off the beaten path, you never know when you are going to be desperate for a spoon! Shampoo is always double bagged in Ziplocks. Ditto perfume bottle. I collect African trade beads as I go from country to country, and they can be packed so easily when rolled up in a gallon size Ziplock! I use the new screw-top Ziplock food container for pony tail grips, hairpins, and scrunchies–the plastic grips don’t get broken, everything stays together, and the screw-top container never comes open on its own!
 Debby Ressa 
When traveling, I put my 7-day am/pm pill boxes inside a large ziplock bag. I have one for me and one for my husband so side by side they fit perfectly into a large ziplock bag. That way the tops won’t come open and the pills get all mixed up in the luggage (which has happened more than once before I tried this trick).
 OhioTina 
All of these are great ideas. I like Casey’s travel ideas–I have to say I do much the same. It seems like we always hit the beach or swimming pool within an hour of needing to pack up&amp;travel somewhere else, so a XL Ziploc is great for holding wet suits&amp;towels, not to mention the sunscreen or lotion that might be needed.
 Sarah 
Whenever I buy deli meats&amp;cheeses, I always use a ziplock bag to store them in. The plastic zip top bags from the grocery store always break at the zipper, and so I skip the frustration&amp;just transfer the products to a ziplock as soon as I get home! Fresh meats&amp;cheeses guaranteed!
 Jessica L 
Create toys for toddlers! Put glitter, tinsel, and a little food color and oil into a quart bag, double bag it with a gallon one, and you’ve got one fancy, homemade entertainment machine! :)
 Sandra Orozco 
I love to save money, so I buy meat in family packs. I divide the pack into single meal portions in ziploc freezer bags, cut off the top of the freezer bag below the ziploc, use my vacuum sealer to remove all the air and freeze until needed. Ziploc freezer bags are much cheaper than buying bags designed for my vacuum sealer.
 Linda 
Leftover cooled grease or oil after cooking. Then it goes in the trash. No mess. I use ziplocs daily around here for many things. They are a neccesity in my house.
 Dave Cipolla 
In case of a downpour and caught outside, one to keep your wallet and one for your cell phone
 Remy 
Ziploc® Brand Big Bags are great for storing large, opened bags of pet food.
 Susan Brewer 
I make meals for my Father (who I’d rather not see cook) which I label and put in the freezer so all he has to do is pull one out and microwave.
 Laura 
I store catnip toys in zip lock bags in the freezer. The bags keep the catnip fresh so I can make 20 or 30 toys at a time to keep on hand to sell.
 Alexis Anderson 
I love to use zipocks for icing!
 Patricia Nenish-Hayes 
I too love the quality&amp;strength of ZIplocs. What I love most about them is that for each of my 4 grandsons, when they are returning home from a visit, ALWAYS taking a“grandma snack”with them, I can mark the bags with a Sharpie and they dry quickly and never smear. Saves for lots of“but that bag was mine!!”when they get home. I name tag everything in the house and that includes all of my plastic storage containers as well as things I refrigeratefreeze.
 http://thecranorfamily.blogspot.com Brittany 
I use them all the time when I travel. I put the toiletries in them. I organize my daughters daily outfits in individual gallon bags. I use them for socks, dirty clothes, and more. I put toys for the car in them. They are great for everything. :)
 Bridget 
I stash a Ziploc bag with a wet washcloth in it inside my diaper bag when I’m out and about with my kids. It is perfect for washing up dirty hands and faces with a minimum of mess!
 Carol 
My kids keep a small ziploc in their soccer bags for keeping their phones dry on rainy game/practice days.
 cindy bruss 
I use Ziplock bags especially the freezer ones for my craft supplies. I can see at a glance beads, markers, glues, etc. that I need. Even my glue gun (cooled off) goes into a bag, along with the right sized glue sticks and small plate I put underneath the gun when plugged in. The gallon sized is perfect and strong. Many of the article’s suggestions I’ve used for years…A very handy product!!!!!!
 Teris 
I cannot begin to list all of the things I use ziplocs for–visit me any time and see all the different sizes I have that I use on a regular basis. Rain gear / winter car blankets are stored folded in 1 gallon bags in the closet so you rotate easier by season. I use the snack size&gt;all the way to 2 gallon for organizing in the pantry.

When pouring liquids–merely push the open bag into a tall glass or pitcher and it will hold up while you add the liquids–then grab the edges and Zip-it closed!

As an event planner by trade–the bags are great to organize items for transport to offsite location–easy to label and strong enough to handle the whole event.
 Theresa 
I pack empty sandwich size bags whenever we travel. They’re good for loose change, seashells, leftovers from cracker or cookie packages that have been opened, damp washcloths to wipe sticky hands/faces, etc.
 MARK 
5. Bring home your dirty clothes from travel or the gym in a large Ziploc.
 Shannon 
#13 There is no better way to marinate!
 Bruce 
I pack the stuff in my shaving kit in a Ziploc bag to make sure nothing leaks out.
 Jane 
Whenever I open a can of tomato paste, I never use it all, so I measure out tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper, widely spaced, and freeze. Once frozen, I fold up the waxed paper and store it in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Whenever I need a tablespoon or two of tomato paste, it’s right there, already measured and ready to go! Thanks Mom, for teaching me this!
 carol 
Carry some with you; they come in handy for everythign.
 Carol 
I use Ziploc bags to keep my leftovers fresh.
 Tom 
Some one once told me to put a few pennys and some water in a ziplock bag and hang it on your porch to keep flies away. I don’t know if it keeps any flies away but it sure creates some strange looks from visitors
 Jacki 
I divide potato chips and other snacks into single servings using the small Ziplock bags.
 Brenda Antonacci 
A 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper fits perfectly in a 1 gallon size Ziploc bag. My children put their spelling words in a bag and take it into the shower with them to study while they shower. The plastic bag“sticks”to the wet shower walls and keeps their paper dry.
I also put 8.5 x 11 garage sale signs into the 1 gallon Ziploc bags to prevent the ink from running if it should rain or have dew accumulate overnight after I have hung my signs for my sale.

Ziploc bags are great for keeping outfits for the kids together- each day, put a shirt, shorts, socks, underwear, hair bows, and other accessories that go with that outfit. This is especially great on trips! They also help keep teeny tinies together…..those little pieces that go to different toys, games, furniture, etc. And if you homeschool, they are great to keep subjects or projects together. For example: math pages with the manipulatives, or beads, glue, paper, etc needed for a craft project. And if you lapbook or scrapbook, you can keep each project together. We use them constantly!!
 http://www.marykay.com/bbruner Becky B 
I am a Mary Kay consultant, and I use the snack bags to send home samples when ladies have facials&amp;makeovers.
 Gloria 
#10 I use ziploc bags to place all the pieces from toys together so they can be found when the kids want to play with them
 Nicole 
We use them to frost cupcakes….dividing out the frosting and snipping the corners stops the kids from fighting on who gets what tube, saves money (those little tubes are expensive!) and does wonders for my sanity. Thanks!
 Laverne 
I put small parts in Ziploc bags to keep from losing them.
 Linda Papineau 
Since I like to keep bread fresh, I break loaves down to smaller units and freeze them in Zip Lock Bags.. works like a charm!!
 Erica 
I use them for everything. Meat marinades, organizing school supplies, snack carriers, temporary trash cans in the car, wet clothes at the beach, food at the beach, etc.
 http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ProphecyRNews/ Lorrona 
I use Ziplocs for absolutely everything! Have one right here with me that has a razor
in it to shave any stray hairs that pop up..lol.
 http://www.budgetblinds.com/bristol Vincent Paul Migliore 
I am in the customer window treatments business. I use zip locks in so many ways, it’s hard to count them! First, I prepare the customer’s paperwork and neatly present all the warranter, instructions and signing papers in a zip lock bag that THEY can re-use at home! That gives me instant eco-friendly credibility! Need less to say, I use small ones for screws and handles and brackets and large ones to combine the small ones into to provide a neatly organized installation. Parts storage of ALL types is used with one-gallon bags for me to visibly and easily see what I need at a glance, making it very efficient for me to service my customers’custom needs, quickly and easily. I wish I could buy zip lock bags PRE-PRINTED with my logo on them, too!
 Allison 
I also use mine like tip #2 says–for putting toiletries or wet shower items in when I travel by plane in case they open while in flight to keep shampoo and such off of my suitcase!
 Melissa 
I keep all of my chip clips in a ziploc so that when I need one to clamp to an open bag, they’re easily accessible.
 http://bzzagentqueenbee.blogspot.com/ Tamie 
This is a bit wacky but it WORKS!! I have boys in sports and before they’re allowed to get into my car, their smelly socks and uniform MUST be rolled up and put into the ziploc bag and then they have to take it straight to the washer. It cuts the smell out and I can drive safely without crashing from passing out from the stench!
 Allison 
Sorry, that would be tip #3. :P
 Mary Capps 
Using it to dispense deviled egg mix into the egg white halves or using it to dispense the dough for cheddar chive gougeres (choux is very sticky!) onto the baking sheet! Makes it go much more quickly and clean up is a snap!

I’ll be walking 60 miles in my 5th Breast Cancer 3 Day in a couple weeks…and Ziplocs are perfect for packing! I pack my clothes for each day in a Ziploc, which works perfect at the end of the day. When I’m headed to the shower, I grab the next day’s bag of clean clothes, and the sweaty clothes go in the bag!
 Justine 
I use Ziploc containers when preparing meals for other families (i.e. when there’s a birth, surgery, other family crisis). It helps keep the rolls/salad/etc. from being smashed when it goes in a bag in my car, and then I don’t have to worry about getting the containers back! Not to mention that they have easy storage for leftovers.
 Lisa 
Right at this moment, I have inside a ziploc bag dry rice and my daughter’s ipod that fell into the toilet. The bag is perfect. Get the air out and roll the bag with the rice around the ipod, then sit it in the window. Hoping the ipod dries out oand works!
 Mary Hollinhead 
My favorite way to use Ziploc baggies is for sorting and storing school supplies,like markers, crayons, paper clips, etc. LOVE THEM!
 Janet 
When traveling, I store all of my maps and tickets in a Ziploc in my purse. That way, if I get caught in the rain, nothing gets wet…and I don’t get lost.
 Karen Koelle 
One of the best uses we have used in Scouts with a ZIPLOC bag is to make omelets. Take a ZIPLOC bag, crack open an egg, allow kids to smoosh around after sealing the top. add ingredients like peppers, onlions, bacon, cheese, etc. place in a pot of boiling water and wait till they are cooked. serve on tortillia with ketchup, hot sauce or salsa
 D M 
Store the baking soda you use for recipes in a Ziploc bag, so it doesn’t absorb odors or moisture.
 Tracy Stone 
Legos! I can sort them in Ziplocs by color and then I can sort them by sets, and then my son can sort them by“special”pieces…
 Ingrid 
If you keep extra cash around the house, wrap it in foil and store it in a ziplock bag in the freezer.

Melt dark chocolate chips in one ziplock bag and milk chocolate chips in another. Melt them in the microwave, cut a small piece off the corner of each bag and drizzle them over oatmeal cookies in a diagonal design.
 Terrie 
I love ziploc gallon bags. I have a registered home daycare and I use the gallon bags to store the children’s extra clothes. I label each bag with the child’s name. This helps me to keep everyone’s clothes separate and sock and underwear together with clothes while keeping the children from mixing clothes up with the others.
 Meg 
My husband and I use all sizes of ziplocs to keep our electronics and valuables safe at the beach…ipod, camera, cell phones and our new fangled electro key fobs…so they aren’t ruined either by salty sea air or the rain that inevitably plagues us. :)
 Jen C. 
I use ziplock bags for everything! I love using them for packing toiletries though. I know that even if the bottle leaks my clothes won’t be harmed. The ziplock won’t leak!!
 JeanMarie Evans 
I work at an animal hospital. When I work the isolation unit, with contagious patients I shower at work. Then I change into clean clothes. My contaminated scrubs and shoes go right into a Ziploc. Once I’m home they go straight in the washer with bleach. The Ziploc bags keep my own pets at home from getting sick!
 http://elainescraftycorner.blogspot.com/ Farscapegirl 
I love the tip to cut the tip off the ziploc bag and use it to decorate a cake with frosting. I just helped over 5 friends celebrate their birthday and I’m always being recruited to bake the birthday cakes!!! This will come in handy in the near future, thank you!!
 Crystal 
I also use them for my deviled eggs. Mix up the ingredients and pipe them into the eggs. So much easier and less clean up!
 Vallery LaBarre 
When you are moving, get a heavy duty Ziploc bag for every piece of furniture that will have to be taken apart. These will organize the bolts. Label each bag, before the movers come, so you know which piece of furniture it goes to (the screws start to look alike). If you tape the bag to the piece of furniture it’s likely to fall off, so collect all the Ziploc bags in a single, labeled box that you guard carefully. Don’t forget the bookcases–the little tabs that support the shelves need a baggie too!
 Sharon 
I use Ziploc bags for keeping plastic picnic utensils in them. I also keep packets of salt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, and tartar sauce in separate bags. I used to keep a few in the glove compartment of the car when we would go on trips, which used to be quite often.

I keep my hand mixer in a Ziploc bag with the blades removed and in the same bag, takes up less room.

If I have leftover sauces and gravies, I cool them, then pour them in a Ziploc bag and close then‘flatten them’and put them in the freezer. Takes up less room.

I use Ziploc small containers for my extra screws, nuts, and bolts, curtain rod hooks, and more and keep them in my‘junk drawer’. I also use larger containers when I make a double batch meal and store half for later in the freezer.

I keep my homemade dried herbs in small Ziploc bags, then place it in a jar with a tight fitting lid. Keeps them fresh much longer.

Brown Sugar: After I open a bag and use some, I fold the original bag as tight as possible, put one of those office clips on it, then put it in a Ziploc bag and back in the original box. My brown sugar has stayed soft for 2 years (I don’t bake often).

I use the Ziploc vaccum bags to freeze all my summer produce and when I buy extra meat or bulk meat when on sale.

Ziploc bags come in handy for all the pens and pencils. Keep them in a Ziploc and they don’t get lost in the drawer. Ink doesn’t dry out as quick either.

I also keep my health, life insurance, etc. information book (where everything is located just in case) in a Ziploc bag in the freezer.

I use Ziploc bags to cover my collection of Ann Geddes babies for displaying.
 Cindy Adkins 
I use them as pastry bags…just cut off a corner!
 Martha 
I do oil painting. The brush cleaner, even the odorless, is not pleasant. When in a class or at home I use a Ziploc gallon size bag to line a coffee can to store my cleaner. I zip it up to keep down fumes. Also easy cleanup and disposal. Then reuse the can.
 sam m 
I love zippies and containers for taking food to neighbors- it even stays warm on the way over!
 Melanie D 
You actually already posted a lot of the ways I use ziplocs. I didn’t read all the comments, this may be a dupe. I use Ziplocs around the holidays. I premix all my dry ingredients for the cookies that I am going to make and write the type on the bags. Then all I have to add are the wet ingredients. This makes it so much easier when it comes time to actually make the cookies. I find it to be a great time saver.
 Malathi 
I store all the kids jewelry like earrings, bracelets in a ziploc bag and put it in my jewel box under everything else, so that it is safe and doesn’t get tangled with other jewelry and I can show it to them later and let them have it .
 Leilani Tosoc 
I play golf and I use the ziplock bag to store golf balls that I find on the golf course while playing!
 http://www.acupcakeformoose.com Rachel 
I put all my nails and screws in a ziploc as well as my matches in another. They also make great blueberry savers in the freezer. Fresh fruit all winter long! Ziplocs never cease to amaze me with their versatility and use.
 Vanessa 
I like to put my toiletries in them when I travel. There is nothing worse than arriving somewhere opening your bag and everything has either leaked or exploded. The Ziploc Baggies are great! and help me avoid big messes.
 Kathie S. 
I love to use them when flour coating meats or vegies-use&amp;toss!
 pussnboots 
I use Ziploc bags for all those crackers, chips, cookies, sugar, and flour that come in incredibly flimsy packaging so they don’t go stale before we can eat them.
 Laura 
I use Ziplocs to carry powdered laundry detergent when traveling. Much nicer than bringing the whole box!
 http://blog.alice.com/2010/09/09/27-smart-ideas-for-ziploc-bags-giveaway/ Paige 
I buy Chicken or pork when on sale put meal size protions in Ziplock Frezzer bags along with the seasoning or marinade and freeze. When I thaw meat is already marinating and ready to cook.
 allyson 
I keep an XL Ziploc bags in our coat closet and deposit all of my son’s keepsakes (birthday cards, school papers, etc.). I label each one with his name and the year, and store them–they are watertight and take up much less room than a plastic tub.
 Jill 
What don’t I use Ziploc bags for? Lately I have been using them to store homemade baby food. I also use the snack size to put daily vitamins in. I do two weeks worth at a time and then put them in a larger Ziploc bag. They are great for ice packs and marinading meat too. I should buy stock in Ziploc! :)
 Nancy 
I use Ziploc bags for all my toiletries when I travel putting shampoo or shower gel in separate bags incase they leak.
When I paint if I have to stop for awhile, I put the wet paint brush in a Ziploc to it won’t dry out until I am ready to finish painting.
I collect the Boxtops for school in a Ziploc until I have enough to send to school.
When I take my grandson for an outing, I put a wet washcloth in a Ziploc for those little sticky fingers.
 Johnett 
I love to use Ziplocs when I’m making deviled eggs. I pop all the egg yolks in the bag and mash them with my fingers, then add my spices and wet ingredients before mixing it all together. When everything is ready then I just clip a small corner off of the Ziploc and pipe the yummy filling in the eggs, which are already arranged on the serving platter. A little Hungarian paprika on top is all that’s needed to transform them into little edible masterpieces!
 Linda Daley 
I use ziploc bags for make up and toiletries in the bathroom.
 http://www.facebook.com/marquez817 Nicole Marquez 
I like to listen to music/radio on my phone while I do dishes only, I worry about getting my phone but need it excess able since it’s a touch screen. So I put it in a ziplock bag to keep it from getting wet.
 Gabrielle 
I always take open boxes of cereal and empty the bags into ziploc bags so that the cereal doesn’t get stale.
 Rachel 
I save my used Ziploc bags for stinky trash–chicken bones, shrimp tails, meat packaging, etc. Seal up the soon-to-be offending items in an old Ziploc bag and toss it in the kitchen bin. That way I don’t have to waste the used Ziploc bags, nor do I have to toss the big trash bags before they’re full–and my kitchen doesn’t stink! Win-win-win.
 J. Spencer 
I always use a Ziplock snack bag as a pastry bag. Makes it super easy and cleanup is a breeze.
 Karen 
I LOVE Ziplocks for keeping track of kids game and puzzle pieces. They will mold to the box size, keep little parts from disappearing, and make it easier for children to put things away.
 Kay 
We use Ziploc bags at the beach to store our phones and cameras to keep out moisture and sand. They have never failed us!!
 Jennifer 
I use the large Ziploc bags to store my“Books on CD”that are used in my classroom and my home. They fit almost every book and they are so easy to see when filed.
 Amy R. 
I’m a teacher, so I have lots of uses for Ziplocs at school and at home. In my classroom, I write each student’s name on a Ziploc, then tape the open bad to the board. Then I can drop in participation points, candy, or other incentives. At the end of the week, the student gets to take their bag.

I also tape an open bag to the side of each student’s desk as a pencil holder. No more“I don’t have a pencil.”

Gallon sized are good for holding a worksheet. Students can write on the bag with an overhead projector marker and wipe it off, then trade.
 Infinity 
I’ve never heard the bubble wrap one before! I like it! Saves me from having to keep a box of packing peanuts“just in case”.
 Alicia Cross 
I like to use them to frost or decorate cookies and cakes. No mess!!!
 Doug 
We have a 6-week old baby in cloth diapers, and NOTHING is more important than having a ziploc in the diaper bag for changes on the go!
 http://ziplockbags Sharon Sallee 
I use the snack size to put confetti in once I open the package. Such tiny pieces, keep well in the ziplock bags. Also put greeting cards in them to keep from one year to the next. Nice, neat and air tight.
 BethieK. 
Q-tips and cotton balls in a small Zip-Lock are always in my manicure kit. It keeps them clean and not fuzzy.
 Kathy Cunningham 
When the kids went to camp, I would put their clean outfits in separate bags, then they would put their dirty clothes back in the bag. NO MORE LOST SOCKS. And it would keep the dirty clothes separate from the clean ones.
 Alice 
I made homemade play-dough for my grandkids over 9 months ago, and it’s still just as good as the day I made it because it has been in Ziploc!
 Emily Ahrenberg 
I use ZipLock Bags for everything! Two additional uses not listed above: (1) I save bread ties in the snack size ZipLock. Then, use the bread ties around USB cords, etc…(2) I put extra pictures in the sandwich size ZipLock to give to friends but yet, keep them clean of fingerprints, etc.. in the mean time.
 Debra Cameron 
I liked the tip on keeping wires and extras together for all of my gizmos.
 Traci 
I always keep a ziploc bag in my purse in case I get stuck in the rain! I throw my phone in it to keep it (and anything else) dry! You can stll use te phone through the bag!
 Brenda Faulkner 
That would be tip #11–hadn’t thought of that one!
 Shannon 
Use small Ziploc bags to organize things in your purse. This works great for receipts, frequent buyer cards, small items such as nail clippers and files, medicines, candy&amp;gum, etc.
 YachtClubMom 
My favorite is #3. I also put my tolietries in Ziploc bags when I travel anywhere.
 Erin 
I always keep a ziploc or two in the diaper bag in case I need to store any extremely dirty baby items until we can get home and get them in the washer.
 Billie Ozerengin 
ZIPLOCK bags are fabulous for travel. I pack everything in separate bags which keeps everything safe and clean and keeps my suitcase from getting messy. I put socks, stockings and underwear in one, bottles of liquids and potential messy stuff in another, dry stuff like Q-tips, combs, etc. in yet another. I even keep extra bags in my suitcase and almost always find a use for them when I travel such as small souvenirs, used dirty clothing, etc…..the possibilities are endless. I have been doing this for over 20 years and I have never had an accidental spill or mess in my luggage. It’s great and I highly recommend this to everyone who travels.
 http://27SmartIdeasforZiplocBags! Sheri Cook 
I use ziploc bags to send beginning of the years forms and other notices home with students to parents. it insures that all forms reach home together and dry. Ziploc bags are great teacher friends. I also store teacing aids and books in them.
 http://www.wallyz.com Kurt Wallinger 
I like #2; started putting manuals, cables, etc. for various electronic gadgets in a Ziploc a while ago and making a label for it on label tape. It keeps them organized for sure.

My favorite is #7–even if your boots are in great shape some snow always gets in somehow–your feet will stay warm and dry with ziplocks on them!
 Morgan Robertson 
Sew a bunch of ziplock bags together along the bottom end, a bunch of big ones or small ones, and make a sort of portable ziplock file cabinet. We have one of these that we have a whole bunch of emergency supplies in. Band-aids in one, medicines in another, snacks, paper and pencils, hand sanitizers in another still, etc. We have ours sewn to a fabric cover with velcro to hold it shut as it is quite large. You can hold so many things!
 Melanie Parrott 
I just used a variation on #16–I have had to give up independent living due to health issues for a while, and when packing up what I would keep in storage for the“maybe someday on my own again”, I put all the disassembled screws, nuts, bolts, manuals, etc. in Ziploc bags to keep all the tiny parts together for future reconstruction.

Use Ziploc bags to keep bathroom wipes in your purse–the double seal keeps these from drying out better than the resealable purse packets.

I live in an apartment complex. When I scoop or take out the cat’s litter I always put it in a ziploc bag before putting it down the trash chute so that it doesn’t cause the whole trash chute to smell.

I like to put knitting projects in the larger ziploc bags!
 Kelley Jacques 
Every time we travel, I put my daughter’s outfits into ziploc bags. There’s no arguements about what to where or what matches, she just pulls out a bag and dresses for the day.

Also, (we live in Michigan) I put rock salt into gallon size bags into my trunk each winter. If we ever get stuck I can just pull it out and it melts us out of the drift. It also serves as ballist in the trunk for extra traction LOL

I use the extra large bags to transport my homemade rolls to my mom’s for thanksgiving. I make a ton of rolls and this has been by far the best way to transpot

ALWAYS to put cosmetics in for traveling- avoid that accident all over your clothes in the suitcase!
 Linda Allan 
gosh, i use them to store bandaids, hair ties and other small things in my purse
 LaCrisha 
My daughter is in Girl Scouts and i use Zip Lock bags to hold all her badges until I get a chance to sew them on her vest. Helps keep them all in one place.
 Sarah Kerzee 
I love to make soups in the winter and I always make extra and freeze them in Ziploc gallon freezer bags. They lay flat so I can put lots in the freezer and save space and have an easy meal any day of the week!!!!!
 Pat Kosterman 
I make double batches of chocolate chip cookies and put them in ziplock baggies in the freezer. When our children come home, they can grab a bag or two and take them with them when they leave.
 Shirley Marchowsky 
Wrap your valuables (money, jewelry, etc.) in aluminum foil and then in a ziploc bag and store in your freezer while away on vacation.

27th tip is a good one
 Nancy Harman 
When my husband travels, I put his pill boxes in ziplock baggies. If the lids accidently open, his pills are still contained in the baggie.
 Donna 
I have my dog’s park pack. Longer leash, ball, water, paper towels, etc. All I have to do is add paper towels and water, which I always remember now because it is all in the Ziploc bag.
 Claudia S Phoenix 
I use Ziploc Bags when sending my kids to camp. I put each outfit in a bag and mark which day it is for. They put their clothes back in the bag at the end of the day as dirty. Great&amp;easy way to keep track of their laundry. I, also, put all their toiletries, camera, Etc. in Ziploc Bags.
 Alecia 
It gets hot down here in the South, so we always like iced drinks. I put extra ice cubes in large Ziplock freezer bags, then when thirsty company is over I don’t run out of ice.
Ziplock bags also work great for nasty, slobbery dog toys after an evening at the dog park!

I like to use a bag to squeeze dough, frosting or other goopy kitchen foods when preparing. Clean up is easy!
 http://Alice.com Sue Muzzillo 
I have a small stitchery crafts business and I use them for everything! I keep a small project in my purse in one, and put everything together for larger projects in larger ones. I even put finished projects to sell in them so they stay visible and clean. And I use the little ziploc container for keeping ends of threads from making a mess.
 Beth Harrison 
Ever find a small item in the house that you don’t know what it belongs to? Mark a gallon-size plastic bag with a great BIG question mark and slip the mystery piece inside. Do this for all those little items you just can’t identify. Then a week or two later, when you can’t find that piece that goes to your camera, or the part that fell off your child’s toy, just grab your‘question mark baggie’, and rest assured that missing piece is there waiting to be reunited again with its rightful half! Mystery solved.

The possibilites are endless! Let’s face it,if it doesn’t breath you can put it in a Ziplock bag.

My Dad would put ziploc bags over his heavy black rubber soled work shoes in the winter, so he could slip on his snow boots with no friction.

I use Ziplocs to keep my yarn in so the moths don’t get it :)
 erica 
i use ziploc bags for our lunches, leftovers, and for our toiletries when we travel. i also love their containers. i also use those for lunches and leftovers.
 Christine 
I buy the large packages of meat and then split them into smaller portions with marinade so they marinate as they thaw. But who are we kidding, there are a million ways to use ziploc bags! :)
 Laurie 
I am a pre-k teacher and I use zip lock bags for everything from separating craft projects for the kiddos to storing their treats they buy at the concession stand. My favorite is the XL bags for storing the kids nap mats and pillows.
 Denise 
I use storage totes and when they are filled I will make a list of what is inside them, put the list inside a ziploc bag and then tape the bag to the outside of the tote so I know what is inside.
 http://www.alice.com Rita 
We sort my son’s clothes by days of the week, into individual jumbo size Ziploc bags, when he goes away to Boy Scout camp. This keeps him neat and organized while he is away from home.
 Karen 
Take two or three paper towels, soak in water and place in ziplock. Squeeze out the air, zip it shut and place in freezer. This is an excellent ice pack…with six kids, I seem to always need an ice pack and always keep a few in the freezer. Keep it zipped and place over needed iced area. The paper towels form nicely over the injury with no sharp or bumpy shards of ice.
 Meredith Pendleton 
My favorite is the leaky boots idea!
 Amber 
I use ziploc bags to keep various bits of knitting and crocheting in as well as yarn scraps, needles and tools of the trade!! I’d be lost without them.
 Charlotte 
Is there anything you can’t use a Ziploc Bag for? There are so many sizes and the uses are as varied as your imagination! It is hard to choose one favorite. I think the first aid and emergency use is great. Having your medical information in a small Ziploc, your medicine and instructions in another, your Doctor’s names and numbers etc. then put them all in a large Ziploc when traveling or for emergency evacuation would be a smart thing. They would be safe, dry, easily located and emergency personnel would surely appreciate it.
 Denise Mathes 
Love the tip about storing pasta. Tip 8. Saves a TON of room in the fridge, too!!! I LOVE ZIPLOC!!
 Cari Campbell 
For sure the best tip is #19. Cut the tip of a Ziploc bag off and fill the bag with frosting – instant homemade pipe frosting tool!

You can get really creative and cut a few really tiny holes, two side by side holes, or go crazy!
 Denise Mathes 
Tip 8 about storing pasta is awesome!!! Saves a TON of room in the fridge, too! I LOVE ZIPLOC!!!
 http://Alice.com Mike Bennet 
I use ziploc bags to defrost frozen steaks under running water in the sink in less than an hour.
 Kim 
I work at an Elementary schoo. We use the Ziplock gallon sized freezer bags for the kids to put books in. The baggie is their“Best Fit Book Bag”and whenever they have a free moment they can get one out and read. It is a great way to keep the books organized and from getting lost.
 Deane Raymond 
We have a“junk”drawer in the kitchen where everything gets tossed to. Every couple of months, we take the drawer out, seperate everything and put the itemized piles in ziploc bags to organize the drawer.
 Jan 
I use them Ziploc for lots of things, even keeping my daughters foot dry in the bath when she cut her foot.
 Josie Fuller 
I store my ribbon for crafting in snack size ziplocks, punch a hole in the corner of each one and hang them on a large binder ring. All my ribbon stays organized, tangle free and I can see every color and print I have.
 Andrzej 
I use the small bags to hold my next dose of medication and I use the gallon size bags to marinade fish, meat or chicken. I put water in the sink and fill the bag w/marinade and meat/fish then lower the bag in the water so the air is almost out of the bag. Makes for a nice compact package and seems to be more efficient in marinading the meat. As a medical use a few years back I burned my hand and used the bag as a first aid device. I turned a bag inside out and covered the bag with Bag Balm. I then put the bag over my hand and turned right side out and taped the bag to my wrist. Alternating six hours on and six hours off during the day helped my wound heal very quickly.
 Debbie in GA 
I let my 9yo collect bugs in them on walks. The bugs stay zipped up inside while she continues to collect. Later, when we’re home and they are forgotten, they are easy to toss in the trash with no fear of escapees!
 Rebecca Osburn 
I use ziplock bags all the time! My latest use is to keep all the supplies for our student art club together. The bags are clear so I can find things easily, the kids can clean things up easily and I can stash them on the shelves where plastic tubs don’t fit.
 Patricia Cossart 
I always put my used roller from painting in a Ziploc bag so it will be ready for use the next day.
 http://yahoo Joyce 
I too am an elementary teacher–we use Ziplock bags for many things. One of my favorites is assigning one ziplock storage for each student in which all their math manipulatives for instruction are kept. With their names on (or not) it’s easy to have counters, play money, dice, or whatever else is needed handy and ready to go!

tip #10 use for legos and barbies extras been doing that for years
 http://www.born-blonde.blogspot.com Shelia Bowman 
Not just for toiletries. When we travel or when my kids go to camp, I put an entire outfit—shirt, shorts, underwear and socks—in a gallon size bag and zip it shut. At camp, if its rainy (and therefore humid), everything is still dry. In the morning, they can grab an outfit bag and the bag with their toiletries and hit the shower without juggling everything. Plus, the upopened ones are still clean when they get back without that musky outdoors smell that permeates everything. It works wonderfully and we have done this for several years. As they’ve gotten older and the clothes take up more room, I can still use a straw to suck out the air before I zip it. It leaves plenty of space in their suitcase this way too.
 Stacey 
I use Ziploc (and Ziploc ONLY) to freeze my veggies and fruits from the summer and take them out in the winter. You can’t use any other brand of bag as they leak and give you a very messy freezer!
 Gayle Watkins 
I really like this idea–16. Put the extra screws and manuals together from your furniture projects in one Ziploc. I am forever searching for things like this.
 Alanha Cruz 
I use Ziploc for almost everything! My favorite is to use them to keep chips and crackers/cookies fresh once I open a bag or package. If a bag of chips is not finished, I just empty the left over chips on a ziploc and they last so much longer and do not get soft for leaving them on an open bag (even if I use clips).
 Ashley Kontos 
My favorite tip: For college football games, when it rains we put our phones in Ziploc bags. These water tight bags keep our phones safe when other’s get wet and end up as useless paperweights.
 Sommer 
I use Ziploc bags to keep my medications bottles organized, either at home or on the go. I also use Ziploc bags to carry my snacks with me to college. I use Ziploc bags to keep small items like lip balm and makeup, breath mints and/or gum separate from the rest of my very full tote bag. Thanks! :)
 Sommer Jones 
Oh, I forgot to leave my last name!
 Cat Delgado 
My favorite tip- Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords!
(Our family has been using this method for years!)
 Margot Gonzales 
My favorite tip: When I am sickly and still going to work I label and pack ziplocs for each day…with cough drops, to-go robitussin, and Tylenol AM cold/PM cold.
 http://www.theplacebeneath.blogspot.com Saralyn 
This isn’t the most delightful use, but it is recycling! Instead of tossing our previously used Ziplocs from lunches, leftovers, etc. we use them for doggie-doo bags. Turn it inside out, pick up the poo, turn it right side out again, and zip it shut. No stink and no flys.
 Karen 
I use bags and containers for lots of things.

One of my favorite’s is sorting different sizes of scrap fabrics after a sewing or craft project. It keeps things neat and tidy and still visible.
 Christal 
I use zip lock bags to make getting out of the house easier. I keep four or five packed at all times with a couple of diapers, a small pack of wipes, and a trial-sized diaper cream. If we’re going to be gone for a couple of hours, I just grab one. For a longer trip, I grab two. This saves me a LOT of stress when trying to get all three of my children out the door!
 D. Spaulding 
I put my skein of yarn in a gallon size Ziploc bag and cut a corner to pull out the yarn so my kitties aren’t tempted to“get involved”when I am crocheting.
 Scot B 
We have used sandwich size to gallon size to XL size Ziplocs to store my son’s enormous collection of lego sets.

As an IT tech person, I have a huge collection of cables, cords, connectors and adapters for computers and AV. I have most all these items sorted, labled and stored in Ziplocs, which makes it easy to find what I need when I need it.
 Dick Weavil 
2. Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords!

This is my favorite….. I’ve been doing it for years!

We use them to keep our camera dry when we go to the beach.

I like #3&amp;13#. I use Ziploc bags for almost everything above. Love them.
 Mary 
Each time I paint a room, I take the lid of my paint can, put it in a gallon Ziploc, and label with room and date. if I need more paint, I have the mixing directions on the top of the can. I can never keeptrack of those little color chips!
 Jodi G. 
I store my pasta and rice in Ziplocs to not only keep it fresh after opening, but to keep out little critters. So far so good—it works great!
 Sandy Jordan 
I use Ziploc bags to hold shampoo and other liquid items for vacation!
 Ann Doman 
When I buy a craft kit, I store it in a 2-gallon Ziploc so I don’t lose any parts.
 Claire 
I love Ziploc bags for storing my personal items when traveling!
 Nancy 
I use Ziplocs to keep extension cords coiled up and tangle-free. Just coil each cord up neatly and place in a Ziploc, push out the air, and store them away. Next time you need an extension cord it’s easy to grab and go.
 http://yahoo Robert Wojtkowiak 
Great on the boat, spare spark plugs and tools in the qt&amp;gal sizes. License,registration and permits not only kept dry but will float! Cheap insurance.
 Stacy 
I give my kids slider ziploc bags to sort their silly bands.
 Mary Wilkins 
I always keep a couple of Ziplock bags in my purse. One of the many ways they come in handy is when we have
dinner out and I want to take home leftovers, I don’t have to use the restaurant’s styrofoam containers, and I don’t have to wait for the server to bring one! Works like a charm and then when we get home it can go right in
the fridge without waiting to be resealed in another way!
Ziplock bags also make great“mini trash bags”for the small waste items that clutter up my handbag.
 http://weaverbeaver.blogspot.com Margey Wyrick 
We use Ziplocs to make care packages of toiletries or snack packsof non perishables that don’t have to be cooked.
Smaller sizes are also good for holding incomplete craft projects, and bake sale items.
 Justine George 
Just like using Ziplocs to pipe icing, I use Ziploc bags to apply paint-on type highlights to my hair. The pull-through caps can be a real pain and it’s hard to get natural looking highlights with the brushes. I’ve done friends’highlights this way too. Much more economical than the hair salon!
 Marie Hansen 
Tape 4 or 5 bags together along the edge opposite the“zipper”. Put photos or pictures from magazines in the bags and share your new picture book with your favorite baby! (Supervised of course)
 Gail Simmons 
I make homemade dog food for our dog who has skin allergies and I use Ziploc bags to package his individual meals. I also use Ziploc bags to put crushed bread crumbs in when I bread meat for frying.
 Amy Cocheo 
I love these bags for cake decorating. Fill with frosting, pushing it all to one corner, twist top. Then cut hole whatever size you want and decorate away. No mess, no fuss and it’s no problem or big expense.
 Yadira 
I love to use zip lock bags to store my unused items such as…cosmetics, toys, keys, ect.
 Francis 
I work at an office where lots of food is brought in the for the staff and frequently there are leftovers for people to take home. I like to keep Ziplocs in my desk so I’ll have something to carry my leftovers home in.
 Betsy Thomposn 
My husband and I run a produce stand in the summer. His mother makes peanut brittle and other delectable goodies for us which are, of course, packaged in Zip Locs, as are our home grown pecans–easy to see through and to affix a price sticker to as well. I also use them to store playing cards whose rubber bands have aged and withered so the Zip Loc is a handy helper in the game room!
 Lyn 
When traveling by air, I place my underwear in Ziploc bags. That way if my luggage is inspected, my undergarments are not handled individually by hand. The inspectors can see through the bag and move it aside without touching everything!
 http://www.frugalgoodies.com Jordan Smith 
I love using ziploc bags and containers to store what I harvest out of my garden. The biggest tip I have is to use the regular ziploc containers for dehydrated and refrigerated items and to use the freezer bags for the items you want to freeze and use in the winter! I just love ziploc products!
 Debbie Major 
The most important use I have is to put home-made brownies into snack size ziplock baggies to send to my nephew who is serving in the US Army in Afghanistan. My niece keeps all her silly bands in a gallon size ziplock bag. She has a LOT of them! I keep the dog cookies and cat treats in them so they stay fresh. When traveling I use them to pack anything that might leak. I keep cotton balls, etc. in them in my purse. I use them for a bunch of things–food included! : )
 Susan B 
I use Ziplocks when making gravy. Once the gravy is made in the pan, pour it iinto a Ziploc, wait for the fat to rise to the top, snip a little hole in the bottom corner and you noe have all the fat easily removed from the gravy.
 Karen K 
I work at a thrift store where I use Ziploc bags in many ways. They are great for placing many different loose items in them for sale. Puzzles, beads, hair clips, candles, jewelry, marbles, greeting cards and note cards, and many other things.

My favorite ziplock tip is storage when camping, as the dinner is eaten the cooler has more room
 ron b 
When walking your dog never leave home without 2 ziploc sandwich bags in your pocket. Everyone will appreciate your picking up after your pet in having a place to put it.

I love the little ziploc containers to hold all the small little items in our kitchen junk drawer, such as paper clips and rubber bands!

I use Ziploc bags to sort different types of medications in my medicine box: one for allergies, one for pain killers, one for bandages, one for ointments, etc.
 Esther Hermann 
Many of my cookbooks are stored in Ziploc bags, often open to a favorite recipe that I use frequently.
I can find the recipe quickly, and don’t even have to take the book out of the bag!
 Mary 
When I go on trips I use my ziplock bags to keep my q-tips, tooth brush, hair tyes, and whatever else I need seperate dry. Works great!
 tpaplanus 
I use Ziplocs for my bar soap when I travel. I put the soap in a small ziploc and take it to the shower with me. When I’m done showering, back into the bag goes the soap. The bag dries easily and doesn’t get soap all over my toiletries and it’s easier to carry, too.
 vicki 
I store photos in mine
 Shannon P. 
I keep ziplocks in my kitchen, car and bathrooms. When they are convenient to get to you can find all kind of uses for them!
 Mona Farmer 
I use Ziploc bags for camping. Flashlights, matches, batteries, anything that will fit into a Ziploc bag. This includes one breakfast worth of pancake mix, vegetables for each meal, hamburger patties, anything that needs to be kept in the cooler. The food stays dry as the ice melts and is easily identifiable for each meal. When it comes to breakfast, just place one egg, some cheese, diced tomatoes, and diced ham into a Ziploc bag, squish everything together and drop into a pot of boiling water. An easy omelet with no messy cleanup.
 Susan G Thompson 
I use the gallon-size Ziploc to flour meats in before frying. The flour‘dust’stays in the bag when I shake up the meats to coat them. When I’m finished frying the meats, I allow the oil to cool in the skillet then pour it in on top of the leftover flour–squeeze out the air, zip it shut&amp;the mess is in the bag. The snack-size bags are great for storing small craft items, such as buttons. The smallest storage container is perfect for holding‘surprise’snacks for the little people during Church services. I also use the sandwich-size bag to carry a wet washcloth in for quick clean ups.

I use my ziploc bags and storage boxes to store inventory for my shop as well as for craft supplies! Keeps everything nice and neat :)
 Jessica 
I like to put my shampoos and lotions and things like that in baggies when I travel so if they leak it doesn’t spread.
 Kerri 
I use Ziploc bags to pack a quick snack for my four year old. They are also great for camping to keep some of my toiletries dry as well as my camera and phone.
 Diane Bainter 
My favorite use is to marinate meat by placing your chicken breasts in with your marinade and stick it in the fridge until it’s ready. Takes up less room in the refrigerator that way!

I am a quilter and I use the ziplock bags to sort my fabric. As I cut fabric for my quilts I sort the left over fabric by size for future quilts. It is wonderful, I can always find the right size and makes finding the right color and size easy.
 Betty Rinderknecht 
I use Ziploc Sandwich bags to sort puzzle pieces. We put the edges in one bag, and when sorting the rest of the pieces, they are stored in separate sandwich bags by color. Makes setting up the puzzle much quicker so we can have fun faster!
 Kay Horm 
I use the gallon size to make cracker crumbs. It is strong enough to use a rolling pin to crush the crackers and then to store the left overs crumbs. NO MESS!
 http://alice.com Carolyn P. 
I love the bags&amp;containers. I cut fresh fruit&amp;store in the freezer all so all year we can make fruit smoothies. It’s wonderful. My son uses the containers for his school lunches, perferct size&amp;they last a longe time&amp;are great in the microwave.
 Sara 
The big ones are great for storing comforters etc during the summer. If the cats get into the box their fur doesn’t get through the ziploc and the blankets are still fresh when I need them in the fall.
 Lorena Keech 
I carry my make-up in a bag in my purse, so it is easy to find and my purse lining stays clean.
 Tiffany Schmidt 
I keep the smallest Ziplock containers in our junk drawer, and desk at home to keep us organized! Our junk drawer is actually an organization drawer!
 Cindy champion 
I use ziplock bags to divvy up portions so I don’t over eat snacks.
 Alyson Anderson 
My favorite idea listed is the one to put all wires/cords in different ziplocs. I put the cords/wires from electronic devices in a bag and label it as they all look the same and when one is needed it is easy to figure out what it belongs to!
 http://maryqin.com Mary 
I’ve got my face wash bar in one so it doesn’t get splattered too much in the shower or dry out and shrink every time my shower dries. I also don’t have to deal with trying to pick it off (you know when soap dries and gets stuck).
 Casi Tomarchio 
My best Ziploc tip is to buy them in every size…you will use them for everything…cooking, toys, cosmetics, medicine and even for travel. And buying the real thing does save you money because they don’t get holes along the zipper portion like the cheap baggies do.

Got to go…freezing my end of the season corn in Ziplocs.
 Robin 
I keep several gallon size bags in my suitcase. When I pack for a trip, I have an organized place for my undies, socks, pjs, scarfs, etc. I use the 2-gallon size for my t-shirts and workout clothes. Makes it easy to unpack right into the drawers in the hotel.
 Paula 
I fill Ziploc Sandwich bags half full of water and hang them outside the doors of the house. Flies think it is a bees nest so they stay away.
 Laura Knowlton 
I like to make SLIME type stuff with my kids using Ziploc bags. Right into the Ziploc, you dump together Elmer’s Glue and Borax that’s been dissolved in water, along with a little food coloring. Then ZIP! Then just start squishing it around in your hands, which feels totally cool. YOu’ll know when it’s ready to play with! Then when you’re done, back in the ZIPLOC for storage! Another fun one is equal parts cornstarch and water.
 V S 
Store supplies for a craft project in a ziploc for easy storage and transporting.
 Randy 
I have used AT LEAST HALF of these ideas already–learned some new ones, though! We use Ziplocks to pack (no leaking or exploding products all over your clothing and luggage) and for dog food and for Q-tips and for bandaids–homemade first aid kits, and, and, and; to store everything on the planet from nails and screws and pieces and parts to electronics and cords, SD cards, etc, to WHATEVER!; to keep money in for fundraisers–or as a piggybank…. Their uses are endless!
 Sandy P. 
I love all the storage and travel tips. I couldn’t travel without Ziplocs in all the sizes, for toiletries, jewelry, camera, maps, etc. As a collector, I use snack and sandwick Ziplocs to group and store my small items, such as recipe booklets, cookie cutters, on and on. How on Earth did we survive without Ziplocs?
 Steph 
I like the idea about pastry frosting with a ziploc!
 Heather 
We move a lot in the military so for each room in the house, we label a ziplock bag and then put that room’s picture hangers and curtain rod hardware in the bag to make it easier in the new house to put things back together quicker. We then put all of the individual room/bags in one big bag to keep it all together.
 http://Alice Gale Hulderman 
My favorite use of Ziplock, outside the kitchen, is for shipping packages to my son in Afganistan. I put all liquid or cream items, food, and clothing items in Ziplock. As it can take quite a while for the packages to get to him, that can mean lots of handling and a greater chance of leaking or loss of freshness. Ziplock Bags keep; any leaked liquid from getting all over all the other items, the snacks and coffee fresh, bar soap from permeating everything in the box, and clothing items from any mishap that would cause a leak to get into the box and ruining them. Love them and am never without them!
 yvonne schaffer 
I use ziplocs for a pet emergency kit. I have over 20 dogs that I have rescued and I keep ziplocs with a leash and an extra collar for each dog and a bit of dry dog food in the kennel areas so just in case we have an emergency and have to evacuate i have enough leashes for everyone and backup collars, just in case.
For the dogs in our house, I keep a ziploc by our exits with leash and extra collars, ready to go, just in case.

My husband goes canoeing and fishing every summer and packs his gear in xxl ziploc bags, then presses the air out as he seals the bags. Keeps all his gear and clothing separate in his pack and dry, dry, dry!
 Melanie Anderson 
Camping is the BEST use of Ziploc. Keeps things dry and organized.
 Suzy Mccawley 
I always carry them in the car, they are great for when you go out to eat and have left overs!
 http://alice.com yvonne boslund 
they are great for saving money. buy large bags of prezels or other snacks and divide in either sandwich or snack size bags. Keeps then fresh and is easier to not over eat.
 Nancy 
I’m a crocheter. I keep my pattern, yarn and all needed supplies for that project in gallon size ziplocs. Then when I leave the house, for doctors apt. or a road trip, I just grab the bag, and everything I need is in it. Plus I can easily see which project I’m grabbing.
 Kim Byrom 
One of my favorite uses of Ziplocls is the piping bag for cakes! But the best and favorite way to use them in our home is to store soups flat in the freezer! Saves room and Ziplock is so reliable–you’ll get NO LEAKS! :)

I use Ziplock bags to put items in to sell at consignment sales.

ZIPLOC OMELET (I don’t know where this came from, but it works and tastes great!)

This works great! Good for when all your family is together. The best part is that no one has to wait for their special omelet!

Have guests write their name on a quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker.

Crack 2 eggs (large or extra-large) into the bag (not more than 2) shake to combine them.

Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheeses, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, hash browns, salsa, etc.

Each guest adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake. Make sure to get the air out of the bag and zip it up.

Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for exactly 13 minutes.

You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot. For more, make another pot of boiling water.

Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily. Be prepared for everyone to be amazed.

Nice to serve with fresh fruit and coffee cake; everyone gets involved in the process and a great conversation piece.

Imagine having these ready the night before, and putting the bag in boiling water while you get ready.
And in 13 minutes, you’ve got a nice omelet for a quick breakfast!

I like the idea of putting newspaper in a large ziplock bag and using it to kneel on when doing yardwork.. Sounds like a great idea. Can’t wait to try it!

My favorite use for a Ziploc bag is one my sister taught me. To save room in the freezer, take your packages of ground beef to be frozen out of that big bulky container. Take a gallon Zipoc freezer bag and place the chunk of ground beef in the bag. Take a rolling pin and roll the meat flat (about 1/4 inch thickness) until it fills the complete bag. Press out any air and zip the bag. You can stack the flats of ground beef in the freezer into a much smaller space than if you left them in the store containers. Also, they thaw in about 20 minutes since they are so thin. Works FANTASTIC!

I use to put bottle nipples or pacifyers in a zip lock bag so they would stay sterile in my purse or diaper bag.

I like the ice pack tip but I have a MUCH better technique than the one you gave.

I pour some Palmolive Dish Washing Liquid into any size ziploc bag (not too much; only enough to make about a flat 3/4 inch rectangle inside the bag). Zip closed and place the bag upside down into a second bag just to be safe for any spillage that might occur over time and seal. Then freeze it flat. It is the best ice pack I have ever used. I sometimes stand the bag up in the freezer to get a rounded solid inside the bag so I can roll it on an injury and it lasts a bit longer as well.

These are some of the coldest ice packs I have ever experienced.

I always bring them on trips with me now. The frozen liquid becomes pliable relatively fast and can be molded to a body part nicely. All of my students are using them now and love them!!

I use gallon ziploc bags to hold ice cubes for coolers in the winter. Keeps water from getting all over the food and containers when the ice melts. Cushions containers and food in the cooler. Easier to empty and keep clean. Cheaper than buying bags of ice
 Ci 
I use a ziplock bag for a changepurse, can always see it and the change.
 Edith M. Parkman 
I keep pens and pencils in Ziploc bags in my purse. This makes them easy to findf and keeps me from rummaging around in the bottom of my purse for one. It also keeps my purse lining free of pencil or ball point pen marks.
 Cathy Marro 
Organize my drawers, put rubber bands, bobbie pins, its great because you can see whats in each bag
 Laurel 
I use them for so many things. Depending upon the size, I will put cereal in it to keep it fresh. I store flour and sugar and may other things in them.
 http://Lisasrainbow.com Lisa Hart 
I use ziplock bags for everything. My favorite use is for taking sandwiches out on the boat. We put them in baggies and put the ice in baggies and that puts two layers between the bread and it does not get soggie.
 Sher 
I use the products for everything from packing lunches to freezing food to craft storage (for easy to see, stack and store items) to sewing materials, to organizing little items in drawers or on shelves. Every room in my whole condo has zip locks to help store or organize something. Could not live without them!!
 Tammara Jeffcoat 
I love putting all those little things in the office and bathroom in a zippy! Paperclips, pens, tape rolls, hair scrunchies, first aid. Makes finding things easier and prevents headaches!
 Em 
I package all of the items for car activities in Ziplocs so they’re easy to grab and put away.
 Debbie 
I use a ziploc bag to store open packages of cheese in the fridge so that the cut ends don’t dry out.
 BARA 
Ziplocs have amillion uses in an RV: store sample size toiletries, make a small sewing kit, put paper clips&amp;a mini stapler in one, slip spillable liquids in one to avoid spills while traveling, store bottles of spices in ziplocs between trips in the RV, and many, many more.
 Anne Oppenheimer 
When I have leftover brown rice from a Chinese take-out meal, I put individual portions into snack-size Ziploc bags and freeze them. It makes meal preparation quick and easy.
 Cindy Dages 
A small Ziplock is great to keep flower seeds in. Holyhock seeds especially, bag by bloom color to give away or plant.
 http://yangyangli.info/ Yang Yang 
10. Store small toy pieces such as puzzles or legoes.
 Juy Ornella 
I use Ziploc bags to organize all the patches and badges everyone in my Girl Scout Troop earns. I sort them and write their name on the outside so I make sure each girl receive what she has earned!
 Sabrina 
My favorite tip is using Ziploc to organize and store electronic gizmos and their corresponding wires and manuals. Great idea!!! I really ought to do that! =P
 Tammy 
I use Ziploc bags to store polymer clay to keep it from drying out after opened and I also use it to knead the clay to soften, some colors will stain your hands this way my hands stay clean!
 Tonya O. 
I use Ziplocs in the kitchen a lot. One of my favorite uses is using a quart-size bag as a“glove”when chopping onions if I run out of disposables. I also cover a measuring cup with a bag when I need to measure out shortening for cakes and such. No mess to wash or wipe out, just pull the bag off and dump out the portion measured. As an added bonus the shortening residue left on the bag can be further used to grease a pan.
 Kristen 
I place nuts inside a ziploc bag before crushing. It’s a lot neater way when cooking!
 http://alice.com Sue Martin 
Use Ziploc to sort beads and burttons for crafting. Also to put clay/playdoh to keep it soft.
 http://alice.com bobbi sherry 
Ziplock baggies are great to put small doses of medication in when you dont want to take the full bottle on trips.
 Jeanette Pasquale 
I love the beach……….sandwich size ziploc’s keep my cell phone safe from the elements!
 dmc 
I use a Ziploc bag to keep my digital camera and my cell phone safe and dry in my pocket whenever I’m trekking around, like in the rainforest back home!
 Deb Benz-Buchholz 
I use ziplocs in jewelry making to sort my beads, and different size jewelry wires together. A small project can be put inside a smaller bag and this bag can be put in a larger bag containing any tools you.ll need. That gives you portability for trips and all can be tucked into a suitcase. I also sort my embroidery floss and smaller amts of yarn into ziplocs.
 Melissa 
I store warranties and the corresponding receipts in ziplock sandwich bags. This keeps the information together in case it is ever needed.
 Teresa 
So many great ideas. Since I just did my son’s laundry (he plays college basketball) and boy does it smell, I would choose the using large bags for dirty clothes idea!
 Mary McMahan 
My tip for using Zip Lock bags: I use the 2 galon size for storing large quilt blocks when making a quilt. I use the quart sizes to store greeting cards that I make and sell. I usually put from 6-10 cards in each and sell them as a group. Also, I belong to a quilting board, and we swap quilt blocks, etc. and the zipLock bags are very convenient to put the fabric in and then place in an envelope. Keeps everything together and clean.
 Patricia Gillespie 
Use w/whildren to make homemade ice cream. Put mix in a smaller bag. Put it in a larger bag w/ ice. then throw around til ice cream is hard.
 Valerie 
I like to use plastic bags for my wet umbrella. The Ziploc idea is better. It’s a stronger bag no holes and surprise leaks.
 http://idolatoz.blogspot.com justin 
I’m sure some people use it to frost cakes and pies. Just fill the bag with frosting and cut off a corner tip.
 Paula W 
What don’t I use Ziploc bags for? But, my favorite is #2, I also store cords and manuals from my electronics.
 http://bcmckell.blogspot.com Chelsea 
I store all my travel toiletries in Ziploc bags! I also like to have lots of them on hand for when I bring meals and treats to neighbors and friends in need.
 Tina Hafertepe 
I use ziploc bags to keep markers in. This way they do not dry up.
 C K 
I store broken jewelry in Ziploc bags so I can take them apart and make new jewelry from them! Ziploc bags help me keep all the pieces in the same place.
 Noelle 
I put kids construction paper discard pieces in it during craft time. Next craft time we have plenty of small pre cut pieces for my kids to use.
 Brenda 
I use number 16: Put the extra screws and manuals together from your furniture projects in one Ziploc. I also put warranties, cords, manuals, etc. that come with electronics together in a Ziploc. It’s a great way to keep organized.
 Shirley Reed 
I have many uses forZip Locks–one of my favorites is keeping one in the freezer to which I add the fatty trimmings from meat until it is full and then I put it out in the garbage can.
 Kelly W 
I use ziplock bags to keep all my daughters little hair ties together. They come in a package of 100+&amp;it’s so much easier&amp;I know they won’t spill out with Ziploc!
 Bev Edge 
When I have a little leftover vegetables from dinner, I put them in a Ziplock gallon bag and pop it in the freezer. Night by night the bag grows until I have enough for a pot of soup or a casserole like Shepherd’s Pie for another dinner. It definitely helps me cut down on waste!
 Patsy 
I use ziploc bags to put pie filling in for the freezer.
 Judith Black 
Ziplock bags are great for corralling yarn, if one is a knitter or crocheter. Put a ball or skein of yarn in the appropriate sized bag, and cut a small hole in one corner to slip the free end of the yarn through. Seal the bag and knit away. If it falls on the floor, the yarn will not get dirty. Storing the yarn in these bags also keeps the yarn from getting tangled with other skeins in storage. In addition, the individual bags can be grouped by color,tyoe, or project in a large Ziplock bag. This use and storage method works well for our Fiber Arts Bunch at the Oldsmar FL Senior Center.
 Rachael 
I just moved and I used ziploc bags for all of my liquids. I put all of my cleaning supplies in bags before boxing them up so that it would not be a mess when we unpacked. It worked great!
 Margaret 
I put the faceplate for my car stereo in a quart Ziploc bag so it doesn’t get scratched up in my purse (we had a car broken into, and the stereo stolen because we rarely removed the faceplate in the past.)
 Kell 
As a kindergarten teacher I use ziplock baggies often. I fill them with hair gel and have students practice writing letters, numbers, words, and draw shapes. I also use them to put individual student activites in, or send them home with one to fill up certain items from home to bring to school. I use them so much that they are on our classroom supply list at the beginning of the year!
 Ann 
I too like using Ziploc bags for storing shampoos, nail polish and remover; all those items you do not want to spill when you travel. My contributions to the suggestion pool are these two things. During a move, I use the smallest bags to hold the picture hanger and nail and tape it to the picture back so they don’t get separated. Secondly, I use the gallon size to put flour inside whenever I coat chicken or pork for frying–crackers crushed inside the bag for coating fish. There are so many ways to use a Ziploc bag!
 http://joyfulcreations2@blogspot.com Joyce 
I have my 4 daughter’s hair accessories sorted in them. One for bows, elastics, barrettes, etc. I also put my extra make-up in zZploc bags.
 Eileen 
We use ziploc bags for so many things! Manuals for appliances, sandwiches at work, veggies in the fridge, leftovers, toiletries when traveling, to name just a few.
 Roberta Collins 
My favorite idea is 3. Store your travel toiletries in Ziploc quart-sized bags. I like to place each toiletry item in a smaller sandwich bag and then put all of those into the larger to avoid any messy spills from the airplane ride. Next time I travel I will do this, and avoid the usual mess.
 Kim Storey 
I use Ziploc bags to keep fishing supplies separated, and then freeze the fish we catch. I also put meat inside a Ziploc bag, seal, and then pound to tenderize–no mess spattered all over the kitchen!!
 Chris 
Ziploc bags are a must in our house. We use them for storing/freezing leftovers, marinading meats, making individual servings, snacks, traveling, not to mention all the uses for crafts, scrapbooking and card making items. We couldn’t do without them.
 http://AT&amp;T Margie Readout 
I use a quart size freezer ziploc to keep my makup organized and leak proof when I travel. Works great!
 Claudia Webb 
I use Ziploc for so many things from putting my little doggies treats and dog food in while traveling. But one of my favorites is to use them as a shaker bag. I can put my seasonings in and my flour, then shake it up and then add the meat in the bag (and the gallon bags hold a bunch). I shake it and it doesn’t break, they are so easy to open and close. Then at the end just close it up and toss it away! I love the Ziploc brand of bags and I really love the ones that expand. Price is pretty good also. Keep up the great work!
 Michelle Court 
I use Ziploc bags for EVERYTHING! I always use the bags to put my toiletries into when to protect my things from unexpected messes…
 sara wake 
I store art supplies in hundreds of Ziploc bags. I’m a collage artist, also assemblage, so there are lots and lots of little metal pieces, lids, broken doll parts, used and discarded wood pieces, paints, brushes, on and on and on. I can’t imagine how I lived without these incredible bags for so long. Thanks
 http://wondertwinadventures.blogspot.com/ Thao 
I use the quart freezer bags to divide ground meat that I have bought in bulk. I save money by buying it bulk and divide it into 1 pound sections, flatten out the air and label and freeze. So when I make tacos, chili or anything requiring ground meat, I take that out to thaw.
 http://www.luv2bfrugal.net Julie 
We use Ziplocs for so many things. In fact, I have one of the Ziploc vacuum sealers, and I’m too cheap to buy more of the vacuum bags, so I put the vacuum bag inside a regular Ziploc freezer bag and suck the air out. Works like a charm!
 Stan 
If a painting job will take more than a day or take a break from painting, place used paint brushes in ziplock bags and seal them to from drying out. Another use is to pack cloths in large ziplock bags. It keeps your cloths wrinkle free and super organized. You’ll also find that it is easier to pack and unpack and you can fit more into your luggage.
 Bonnie 
I use a ziploc bag to keep my daughter’s markers, crayons, chalk, and colored pencils in.
 Constance Taggart 
Put your bolts and screws in a ziploc bag after you have taken furniture apart when moving. After all the pieces are apart and the screws and/or bolts are in the bag–seal it and tape securely to the furniture you are moving. Saves lost pieces.
 Maxine 
I like to crochet. I used Ziplock bags of several sizes with my needlework. I use the quart size to hold a skein of yarn as I crochet–the bag keeps the skein from unraveling as I work. I use the gallon size Ziplocks to hold partially completed projects, along with the yarn and any embellishments. I use the sandwich size Ziplocks to hold embellishments such as buttons or ribbons or small bits of yarn.
 karla 
I love Ziplocks for my coupons! 1 for the coupons to take to the store and another to put the coupons in after I find the item!
 Catherine 
My favorite suggestion is–Put all your wires, disks, manuals from your electronic gizmos into their own Ziploc. Label it so you don’t mis-match cords!

I use Ziplock bags to make take along art kits for my children. I put Crayons in a small bag, a glue stick and scissors in another small bag, stickers in a small one, and put them all in a big one with paper and a fun book. We grab them when we are walking out the door and they keep my kids occupied whilein the car, out to dinner, in Church, at sporting events or wherever we need them.
 Michael Richmond 
A large ziploc freezer bag is great for keeping pens, pencils, markers, glue and other crafty things.
 Tammy Greer 
I usually buy big packages of hamburger and chicken and then bring them home and divide them up into meal size quantities. I then put them in ziploc freezer bags and freeze them for future use. This is a great way to save money because I always buy the meats on sale.

 Celia 
I make an ice pack in a ziplock bag for my headaches, it never leaks!
Marinating food in a ziplock works great as you can squeeze all the air out of the bag so that all the food surface is in contact with the marinade.
 Claudia 
I always hated to put my wet swimming suit in my gym bag after going to the gym. A large ziplock bag is a great idea for putting your wet suit in so your gym bag does not have to get wet every time!!
 CJ 
Cut up fresh vegetables and place in Ziploc sandwich bags for a quick snack.
 Cassandra 
I put my creams in there sometimes so it can be cold on my face.
 http://ascendingbutterfly.blogpsot.com Tracy 
I love using them for crafting supplies and I also love using them when I make soup in batches on weekends. I can make a whole bunch of different soups and use the ziplocs for portion control, to have some for lunches and to just generally freeze whatever is not going to be consumed for that meal! And since they are see through and I label them, there is no confusion later! :-)
 Frank 
Instead of canning my homemade tomato sauce I now put 3 cups in a quart size Ziploc, press all the air out and lay it flat and freeze it. Once it’s frozen they can be neatly stacked in the freezer. To use, just set it upright in the sink and thaw, any water left in the sauce will rise to the top and can be poured out before putting it in the pan. Much easier than canning…
 Denise 
My favorite Ziploc tip is to grab a quart sized Ziploc for your pocket eReaders when you go to the beach or pool! I put mine in one and the Ziploc has kept it safe, dry and sand-free on both of my beach trips this Summer. Just one more reason I don’t travel without Ziploc. :)
 Carol Nine 
I like the idea of storing small toy or puzzle pieces in a Ziploc bag. My grandchildren just love toys with lots of parts and this helps to keep them from getting lost. When they get lost, someone usually finds them by accident by stepping on them. Ouch!
 http://gmail,com liljanny 
When i travel, i use a zip lock for each day for clothes that way i dont over pack and it is wasy at the air-
port if they pull anything out of my carryon. it takes the guess work out of what to ware and speeds up the bathroom time since i have wverything i need all together and then i drop my dirty clothes in the empty bag/
 mickey leonard 
To save money, we buy meat, canned and baking items in bulk and then break it into meal-size serving sizes to freeze. I label the Ziploc bag with the contents and date. Then pull it out of the freezer when I’m ready to defrost and cook.
 Jenny Simpson 
I love ziplock bags for freezing peaces, peppers and pretty much all my garden produce. I also use them to protect special scrapbooking projects.
 Kathryn 
Ziplocks are fabulous! I love the small ziplocks containers with lids (1/2 cup, 1 cup etc) to bring snacks to work. It helps me control portion sizes and keep track of calories based on accurate amounts I eat. I also like to drink loose-leaf but hate the smell of old tea in the garbage can a day or two later. So I just dump my loose tea into a small snack-sized bag before discarding. No more smell :-)
 http://Alice.com Jane Maietta 
I use ziploc bags while traveling a lot. I roll up underwareand put it in a medium size bag. I choose a complete outfit for the day ,put it in a large bag zip it almost all the way, then put it on a hard surface chair,sit on it to expell the air,and zip it shut while sitting. Sometimes I put just One large item in a bag and do the same.

It makes it easy at the airport for the baggage inspectors to see what is in the suitcase and my clothes stay neat. It is also easier to pick an outfit for the day.
 Diana Linder 
I counted pack a lunch without them. They keep everything fresh and I always keep a supp;y handy, even for storing left overs.
 Amber Liptak 
My 3 favorite ways:
Buying food items in bulk and then separating them down to normal portions for later use.
Putting my“wet”items while traveling in a large Ziploc so my clothes and other items don’t get coated in shampoo, facewash, toothpaste, etc.
Using snack size Ziploc to make myself right portion size snacks for while at work.
 Lisa Varner 
Zipping are great for so many things! One unique use is for when we camp or great for backpacking. I fill a gallon size with air (you may like to use a straw to blow air in an almost sealed bag). Then I put it inside a t-shirt or sweatshirt to make an instant comfy pillow! I have also used this trick in the car on long trips.
 Holly 
I like to marinade foods in them, not only is it a great way to do it, it also keeps your fridge free from possible cross contamination and keeps it clean!

Thawing frozen meat in ziploc bags is the best way to go! No messy juice in the fridg!
 Teresa 
My Granddaughter, Victoria Elena, 8 months old, has a cancer called Leukemia AML and is currently at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas. We have always used Ziplock bags for travel and storage, but everything has to be safe and sorted in her room and has to be ready if she has to be moved for her procedures or for when she is allowed to go home for a few days between her Chemo treatments. It is surprising how much stuff is accumulated by my daughter when you live in a hospital room for a month or longer and the Ziplock bags make her organized and ready to pack and move quickly. Thank you so much for that! You can read her story at victoriasvoyage.com and on facebook under victoriasvoyage. Also, Texas Children’s Hospital has a website and on the Carepages she has pictures and updates. Look for Victoria Hernandez.

I use them keep batteries, crayons, and other small things organized……no more junk drawer mess!

Ziploc bags are all over my household and used extensively. My personal favorite use is to marinade meat before grilling.
 Teresa 
Thank you Ziplock Bags…Here is a picture of Victoria and I together in the Children’s Garden next to the Ronald McDonald House on the 4th floor of Texas Children’s Hospital. The Doctors and Nurses and Staff are exceptional, very kind and teach all of their patients and their families how to use Ziplock bags to keep everything clean, sanitary, organized and ready to go in a moments notice.
 Sarah A 
I use ziploc bags to buy in bulk and then make single serving sizes. For example with my sons snacks and with meat.
 Kay 
We use them at work to keep patients belongings separate for infection control purposes.
 Terra-Leigh Baghurst 
Our 4 year old son has really enjoyed discovering all kinds of interesting bugs this summer. If he happens to find a dead specimen that he wants to keep, we’ve found ziplock bags super handy to keep them in so he can show his family and friends. His most favorite find this summer was a dead cicada.
 Elizabeth 
I use ziplock bags to cover my hands when I paint/stain. It keeps the paint/stain off my skin and nails.
 Joanne 
I use Ziploc as pencil and school supplies case. I will 2-hole punch a quart size bag (or 3-hole punch for a gallon size) and fill each with pencils, pens, highlighters, and erasers. One goes in each kid’s binders for school. They don’t have to worry about carrying these supplies to each class and they are ALWAYS prepared with Ziploc!
 Ashley J 
I use Ziploc bags in my purse to keep everything organized.
I carry a HUGE purse so i always loose stuff.
This is what i use a Ziploc bag for
1 for makeup
1 for hair ties
1 for my medicines
1 for change/cash (since i dont carry that much i always use debt i just keep change for the vending machines at work :-) )
1 for my mini hairspray and lotion
1 for personal products (tampons/pads)
And so on…
The snack size bags work good also.
 Stash B 
I use Ziplocs for all the basci kitchen storage, but most recently to sort legos for my Son, who is always constructing a work for art.
 Chris 
I use them for sorting pens and pencils, for holding jewelry pieces at a garage sale, holding buttons, and yes an old standby-to put meats in the freezer to make meal-sized packages when we buy in bulk
 http://alice.com Vivian Ayres 
The versitility of the bags are great. Ziplock’s siae variety lends itself to many uses.
 Paula Morgan 
love small sandwich size bags. use them to store/freeze my homemade dog food. just pop one out and it has enough to feed dog 2 times. thaws fast and NOT messy!
 Anne C 
Ziplocs are perfect for putting dirty diapers in, even when you have a trash can available. That way it doesn’t smell up the restaurant’s/church’s/friend’s bathroom.
 Alex 
I love the bags and the containers!!! I use them for everything that I need stored, or kept dry. I use them to place my hair oils in so they will not get all over my bathroom shelves.
 http://alice.com PAT HELMS 
no day goes by w/o my using ziplocs. I make dog treats and carry them with us when we travel, and always have kid treats in a ziploc in my purse in case we meet a child who needs cheering up. I also take lunch to work in ziploc containers
 Lisa 
We always pack bottles of sunscreen in large Ziplocs before going on vacation, and now that we have a little one, I put Ziplocs in the diaper bag to hold extra diapers, a change of clothes, wet/messy clothes (if that happens), and so on. Love them!
 LisaGrace Alsbury 
I use ziplocs for everything. But my favorite use is for all my craft supplies. I have a ziplocs for my essential sewing supplies, fabric scraps, hot glue gun, paper scraps, thread, yarn. Using the ziplocs helps me to quickly put everything into my craft box, and quickly pull out what I need, when I need it! : )
 http://Alice Rosemarie LeNoir 
My favorite Ziploc use is at this time of year when we’re thinking of Halloween and fall. I buy the special Trick-orTreat bags Ziploc makes and fill them with treats for the kids that come to my door. I then use a personalized sticker to put on the bag to let the parents know that the treats their children received are safe.
 Mandee Orendorf 
I like #2. We just keep a box with all of our extra cords in it and it’s a pain to look through trying to find that one cord! This would work great!

 Lynette Cruz 
Anything that you don’t want to get wet goes ina ziploc! Toiletries when traveling as well as clothes already worn go in ziplocs.I use them to put frozen containers of drink in that go in a bookbag or lunchbag also! There are a million marvelouse uses for these!
 Karen Robbins 
I put Ziploc bags of every size in our first aid kit and then we’re ready to make ice bags any time and anywhere.

My wife-to-be puts her electronic book reader in a Ziploc bag and reads while she soaks in the bathtub.

I use ziploc bags for everything from food storage, to keeping toothbrushes and toothpaste in while traveling.
 Karen 
I use ziploc bags to keep my daughter’s many hair ballies sorted….multi-colored with multi-colored, stripes with stripes, large ones with the large ones and so on. I then put the differnt bags into a divided sorter. I also use them to keep barrettes separate from the scrunchies. I also use lots of them when we travel in our toiletries bag just in case things like the toothpaste don’t get squished and leak all over the rest of our stuff in the bag. I have also used the snack bags in my jewelry tray to keep my sterling silver jewelry from tarnishing so quickly. I use ziploc bags so much, my husband calls me the ziploc queen. :-)
 barbara eakin 
when having a garage sale, I will put most items in ziploc bags, such as pieces of jewelry, toys with extra pieces, clean and folded sheets, towels, blankets, any sets of items together in a ziploc bag. This makes for more organized looking sale and I find they sell better looking since people can tell they are well being taken care of.
 Colleen Stadnick 
I used to use a separate cosmetics case when flying. However, since just about every airline charges for luggage now, I decided to pack all my cosmetics and beauty stuff into Ziploc bags. Lotions, and anything that leaks into one bag; make-up, beauty tools, etc. into another. They all arrived leak free on my last trip. YAY for Ziploc and thanks for the contest!
 Melinda Sherer 
I use them to sort everything! My drawers are sorted with them to organize batteries, the kids crayons and all sorts. They come in all sizes for blankets for the closet to sorting game pieces. Ziplock is great!
 http://Alice BEATRICE 
I fill a ziplock bag with ice to ice my back when I’m having a long day at the office. I also use them to carry disinfecting wipes in my purse, which I use at the gym, public bathrooms, wherever the need arises.
 Jacqueline Poppell 
My favorite use (besides food) is using them when I pack to put anything that may drip on clothes in them. This has saved my clothes on more than one occasion. Imagine getting to your destination and unpacking your suitcase to find your clothes covered in shampoo!
 Christina S 
Great to use the large ziploc bags for putting togethera travel pack for the kids, with crayons, and colorbook.
 http://alice.com Brenda 
The best use of Ziploc bags for us is while traveling. We ride motorcycles and often do not have a lot of room for packing. So we use the very large Ziploc bags for a complete change of clean, dry clothes and single use toiletries. At night when we are checking into a hotel, we only have to pull out a Ziploc bag of clothes and head to our room. In the morning the bag is reused for dirty clothes. This saves us space for packing clothes on the bike and we only have to carry one bag into our room. How easy is that?
 http://alice.com Brenda 
A good use for Ziploc bags at our house is for donating toys. When my son was young he spent many days and nights in the hospital. We were in the same unit each time. The toys they had were nice but after many times in the hospital my son was bored with them and the toy cupboard was always a jumble of mismatched toys. The next time we had to go in for a stay, we packaged small cars and trucks, puzzles and Lego pieces together in Ziploc bags and donated them to the unit where my son stayed. This kept all the pieces together and made it easy for kids to see what was available to play with when they went to the toy cupboard. The staff at the unit was very grateful.
 Jeanne Rivoira 
I love Ziploc bags. I use them frequently–mostly in the freezer. Living on Cape Cod, MA. we regularly go to the beach and the storage bags come in very handy when packing lunch for the beach.

When I make vegitable soup in the summer, I put some in Ziploc quart freezer bags. Then a cold winter day, I take on out and put it in the microwave and enjoy a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter’s day.

I use ZipLoc bags when I travel. I have a separate bag for my morning routine and evening routine. Teeth-related items go in another bag, and nail items are in another. In my larger cosmetic bag, it’s easy to just pull out the smaller bag I need at the time. Items are kept clean, and spills are limited to the contents of the bag.
 Krishnan Ramachandran 
I use Ziploc double zipper bag to store cooked food in the freezer.

My favorite tip was #10: storing game and puzzle pieces in a ziploc bag.
 Carol E. 
I like the large gallon and bigger sizes for travel. Why buy the expensive vacuum style or roll-up clothing storage bags…Place clothes inside and zip closed to 1/2 inch of edge. Squeeze out excess air and quickly seal last bit. Saves so much space when packing.
 Sandy 
I’ve done lots of things with ziploc bags. I always use a bag for my toiletries when I travel, but I think my favorite tip is no. 10. I got rid of all those flimsy boxes that puzzles come in and put the puzzle in a ziploc with the picture on top of the box.
 Carla Jones 
I have several uses for Ziploc bags including when I go to the bank. I store change that I have collected into the plastic bags. It’s very convenient and when I dispense the coins into the machine I usually keep the empty bag for another time.
 Regina N 
Before we go camping, I fill several gallon and quart size Ziploc bags with water and freeze them. I use them to keep food cold and fresh in the cooler. This saves me from buying ice on the way out of town, and gives me fresh water for cooking the next day!
 http://alice.com Chris 
I like to put my cell phone in a ziplock while I am at the beach or pool. Waterproof
 Kirsten 
Tip number 3—using Ziploc bags for toiletries to avoid leakage when traveling—is my favorite. If you have lots and lots of photos that haven’t been placed in albums or scrapbooks yet, Ziploc bags are great to keep them stored, protected and separated by date, event or whatever. I also use them for my cat’s Whiskas Cat Milk as the original packaging is no good to keep it in once it’s opened.
 James 
My wife uses Ziplock bags to store the soap around our sinks-the bags keep the soap from getting moldy and wasting away.
 Emily 
I use Ziploc bags&amp;containers for everything. I freeze meatballs in the Ziploc freezer bags, and also use the bags for leftovers. I use a sandwich size Ziploc bag for my toothbrush when traveling. I also like #3–I do this with my shampoo, conditioner, and lotion when traveling.

My all time favorite use for Ziploc bags and containers is similar to #24. I portion out snacks like trail mix, roasted almonds, or dried fruit in little Ziploc bags or small Ziploc containers to take with me on the road.
 Arica Saltzman 
I use ziploc’s for everything. We recently used them to put our wallets, cell phones, camera and keys in while on a water hike. Worked great!
 http://mflorio99@comcast.net Mary Ann Florio 
I put washable paint in a sealed quart sized Ziploc bag and let my daughter“draw”with her finger on the outside. We practice our letters and make simple shapes. It’s fun, mess free and doesn’t require cleaning up!
 Anja 
Our favorite tip is #24 but we use Ziploc bags for everything. One of our favorite side dishes includes using a Ziploc bag: we like to add olive oil and spices to a Ziploc bag and then add cut up sweet potatoes to coat them evenly without the mess. Bake on each side for 20 minutes, done.
 Lynn Litchfield 
I use them when I travel to keep items from leaking and to satisfy the TSA when I fly.
 Joanne Bentivegna 
I use Ziploc’s for everything. As for my favorite use for Ziploc bags and containers I already use them for #3, #4, #22, #24 and #25. I also use them for a lot of others. They are the best. Thank you.
 Pat Matczak 
I separate the kids toys into various ziploc bag sizes. Keep playdough separate from cars, legos; the kids can see what’s inside and they do not seem to mind putting the toys back.
 Darlene Schmeckpeper 
I liked #7&amp;# 11 tips what great ideas!
 Kim 
Besides using Ziploc bags for food storage and for lunches, I also use them for anything that could possibly leak when traveling, that is make-up, lotions, face cleaners, toothpaste and brushes. They work great for these kind of things.
 Karen D 
My best tip would have to be using a ziploc for our camera when going on water rides at the theme park! Great giveaway!
 Kim S. 
I buy ground beef that comes in 5 pounds&amp;split it up so that I have Ziploc bags filled with one pound of ground beef in each bag before putting the bags in the freezer. This way I don’t have to defrost an entire 5-pound all at once. I can just take a pound out of the freezer when I need it.
 joyce wilson 
Bring home your dirty clothes from travel or the gym in a large Ziploc.
 Christine 
I use them for various things, but I buy meat in bulk and freeze it in separate bags, in the morning I pull it out and add oil/spices etc. for marinade. When I get home, it is all defrosted and marinated in one bag and ready to cook!
 Darla 
I use Ziploc bags to put my cereals, sugar, flour, spices, pasta, breads, etc…to keep all of them fresher for longer, and Ziploc bags takes up less space then all of the expensive containers. You can also wash and reused them when they are empty.
You can also use the X-Large bags as garment bags when traveling or just hanging in your closets, keeps your suits, coats and dresses neat and clean.
I also use them for most of the other ideas that were mentioned above.
 http://wrightfez@yahoo.com Dolores Wright 
I love to freeze individual packages of meat balls for appetizers or spaghetti in small Ziplock bags.
I use medium-sized Ziplock bags for bubble pipes and bubbles for outdoor fun. I also use Ziplock to freeze strawberries and other fruit for year round pies and healthy nibbles.

When I take a break from painting, I place my brush in a zip lock bag. Then later I can start painting and the brush has not dried out.
 http://Alice Ann Griffith 
When I need to take a break from painting, I put my brush in a zip lock bag..Later as I start painting again, the brush is fine to work with and not dried out.
 Mitzi Crawford 
I buy meat (like turkey breast pieces, chichen breasts, cheaper pork pieces, beef pieces) in bulk or when there is a really good sale. Then at home divide it into indvididual portions and freeze in Ziplock freezer bags. Then they are easier to cook frozen in my NewWave Oven! I also some times buy hamburger meat that is discounted, get it home and cook it up, divide it into recipe size portions and freeze in Zip lock Freezer bags! Sometimes I go ahead and cook up onions with the hamburger and that makes afor a really fast meal idea! Soup starters or spaghetti sauce beginnings etc! I LOVE my Slider Smart Zip Ziplock bags!
 Malena 
When traveling with the dog, ziploc bags are great to portion out the food needed for each feeding time. We then use a larger bag to carry all of them. That way we don’t need to bring the huge food bag!
 Mitzi 
At the Y, I kept my undies in Ziplock bags marked with a marker one for clean and one for dirty. That way when I finished swimming and had showered I could tell which was which LOL.
 Jennifer B 
I used gallon sized Ziplock bags to hold activity sheets and directions for center work when I taught fourth graders. That way all the materials they needed were in one place and they could clean up the station before they left.
 Jennie 
If we’ve got some veggies that we’re not going to use up before they go bad, we throw them in a bag in the freezer to use later.
 Michelle 
I use Ziplocks for everything! One of my favorite uses is putting wet wipes for the kids in one to keep in the diaper bag. Great for diaper changes or sticky messes on the go without having to purchase separate travel packs.
 Shirley 
I use them to store various medications when traveling. You can see what’s the bag, and they take up less space than pill bottles.
 Jackie Lindsay 
Anytime you are cooking and need to coat your food, Ziplock bags are the way to go . It doesn’t matter whether it’s egg, milk, flour, cornflour, bread crumbs, soup mix, or spices, Ziploc bags never leak or break. When you’re done there’s no clean-up, just throw the bag in the trash and you’re done.
 http://www.stopwastingmoneybook.com Carol Coots 
If I was sick and still had to work I would place all of my medications and remedies in a ziploc bag, including homemade peppermint candy. Makes them easy to find and candy easy to share with other people sick.
 Amanda H 
I use them for dirty socks when I’m on vacation or camping so they don’t stink up the rest of my clothes! O.O
 Jessi 
I buy my snacks in bulk and divide out my portion sizes in advance into the snack-size Ziploc bags. That way when I’m hungry, I only eat a serving and not the whole bag!
 Rebecca Moore 
We use them at work for counting out cash drawers. Each cashier has his/her own bag, and we re-use them unlike the envelopes we used to go through in the past.
 Sherie 
I am a Tastefully Simple consultant and I divide my samples up into ziplock bags and label them.
 Terri 
I use a ziplock baggie filled with white rice (doesn’t matter what type, long grain or instant) to dry out a cell phone, if it was dropped in water. Take the back off the cell phone, take the battery out, put the phone, battery, and backing in the baggie, and fill with rice, zip it up and do not remove the phone items for at least 6 hours. It has worked everytime.
 Kelly 
I use ziplock for EVERYTHING in my kindergarten classroom. They are great for holding lost teeth (snack size), left over craft items (sandwich&amp;quart size), sending books home (gallon size), and sending wet clothing items home (2 gallon size).
 Debby Calloway 
I fill halfway with Kool-Aid or Crystal Lite and insert straw. Zip up tight to the straw, set upright in freezer and freeze till mushy. Voila, an easy frozen treat on a hot day!
 Claudia 
i use my ziplocks for about any and everything . from baking my dogtreats and freezing them in individual little ziplock bags to marinating my Meat .
thanks for the chance :)
 paula plapp 
I use ziplocs for just about everything, including many of the uses already mentioned. I also use ziploc baggies for my current knitting projects. I can keep the working ball of yarn in the bag and close the zip almost all the way. Then I just knit away and the ball stays put. When I’m ready to take a break the whole project fits back in the bag (use a bag to fit the size of the project), yarn, needles, pattern etc. This works really well when I am traveling by car or airplane.
 Joyce Rogers 
I found a baby squirrel and the first thing it said was to keep it warm. I din’t have a hot water bottle, hot pack or a heating pad so I half filled a ziplock bag with hot water and used it to keep the squirrel warm. Thank you ziplock!
 Karlyn Nance 
When I pick up my grandchildren from school, I take them healthy snacks in Ziplocs, for them to munch on the 30 minute drive home. Any left overs are easily brought inside to keep until they are hungry again.
 http://alice.com Pat Rowland 
I have 3 kids ages 23, 18,&amp;16 so Ziplocs have been a part of their lives from day 1 such as putting all the little diaper bag essentials divided out. Of those that went in the diaper bag the one that was (literally) a life-saver was to put pre-measured powdered infant formula into the snack-size ziplocs&amp;then put several of those into a quart-size ziploc. Then all you had to do was pour the powder into the bottle/add bottled water and no matter where I could always have it on hand. Even though my kids are out of that stage I’m an Infant/Toddler Daycare Teacher&amp;share this tip often with my Parents.
 http://alice.com Margo 
When movong, place all the wires, remotes and extra pieces for each appliance (TV, DVD player, blender) in an appropriately sized and labled Ziploc bag. When you get to your new home, you don’t have to search for missing pieces.
 Michael 
I use”Zippies”for all my projects to keep things organized. My important papers,emerg. medications,etc…My Hurricane kit !! But, personally,my favorite use is for my NFL souveniers…from autographs to pictures to signed jerseys (Thanks again Brett !) They are perfect for any imagination ! I love them,Thanks for such a cool product !
 http://www.alice.com Misty W 
I like to use Ziploc bags to store like items to keep my storage closet organized!
 Brenda Richards 
I still have the opaque ZIPLOC gift wrap bags that they made several years ago. We have re-used them many times…..every Christmas. They were the best (although discontinued) item Ziploc ever made. I really wish they’d bring them back!

I use regular Ziploc bags for EVERYTHING food-wise that comes in a normal bag…..I replace the manufacturer’s bag with a Ziploc bag for storage…..cereal bags found in the big boxes….frozen corn…..a couple of chicken breasts….single pounds of ground beef…..etc. It stores soooo much better that way.
 Kathy Mueller 
It might be easier to ask what I don’t use Ziplocs for but my favorite use would have to be storing my Christmas light sets in their own gallon-sized baggie. I can see what colors the bulbs are and when you squeeze all the air out they take up so much less room. YAY for Ziplocs and thanks for such great products!!
 Carrie Gentry 
I’m a pharmacist and I love how easy it is to use Ziploc bags when compounding topical preparations. Just squeeze the ingredients (creams, ointments, lotions) into the bag, seal, and mix thoroughly. When ingredients are completely incorporated, snip open one corner with scissors, squeeze the product into an ointment jar, and toss the used Ziploc bag into the trash. Voila! It’s quick, easy and Mess Free!
 Dawn Morris 
I keep my medications in a snack size bag in my purse. Easy to carry and I always know what I have!

Storing your silver (tablewear, jewelry, whatever else your have) in ziploc bags will prevent it from tarnishing! For earrings, this also keeps your pairs together.
 sharon e 
i use and reuse ziploc baggies, pack my lunch then bring them home turn them inside out and put on the top rack of the dishwasher to clean and sanitize them, then reuse them again and again.go green with ziploc!!!!
 Marianna 
I use Ziploc bags for so many things. Two things I do a lot is I put the opened can of cat food in one and zip it closed to store in the fridge. I also use them to make hot packs. I use them for my toiletries for travel, store ANYTHING that I want kept safe from moisture, bugs, etc. Ziploc rocks!
 Sarah R 
I cut a small slit in the bottom of a ziploc&amp;store my ribbons, when I am sewing and need ribbon, I can then pull it out of the bag w/o tangling my ribbons.
 Ludy Gibson 
I use Ziploc bags when we are camping. If we go out in the canoe, I put things that might otherwise get wet like my cell phone, car keys, wallets, camera, etc. in a Ziploc bag. I zip the bag almost all the way and then BLOW THE BAG UP and finish zipping. If the canoe turns over, not only will the items not get ruined, but the items will FLOAT so that we don’t wind up stranded in the middle of no where with no phones, money or car!
 Ludy Gibson 
On holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving, we often find that we have more leftovers than will fit in the fridge. I just take all the leftovers, gravy included, and put in Ziploc bags. Viola! There is more than enough room for everything to fit nicely and when all the leftovers are gone, no dishes to wash and clean up. Just throw the bag away!
 Kari Steele 
As a teacher, I like to use the Ziploc slider bags to store educational games that I make, whiteboard markers with erasers for individual students to easily pick up as needed, Crayola markers because the boxes don’t last, etc. I use the 2 gallon size bags to store listening centers. I also plan to use the XXL bags to store charts and bulletin board pieces.
 loriane straits 
i have used ziplocs in so many ways…food, toiletries when traveling, arts/crafts, love using them for my paint brushes so i dont have to keep cleaning them. i have used them in almost all of the suggested ways. always find something new to use them for by thinking outside the box.
 mary 
I like to use ziplocs to store lingerie and other delicates like stockings- it helps keep them organized and helps prevent snags.
 Rita 
When I fly I put everything I can in a Ziploc bag. Meds, jewlery, shampoo, body wash, etc. socks, underwear. shoes and all essential papers. At home it seems everything from food to all the little stuff we have is in a Ziploc. I have everyone in my family turned on to Ziploc!!
 Linda A 
I send ziploc bags to school to bring home all my kids projects so that the glittery mess stays in the bag&amp;not all over their backpacks&amp;my house.
 Ben 
I buy large bags shredded cheese on sale and then divide them up equally in ziplock bags to freeze for when I make pizza or any other dish needing cheese.
 Candy 
I use ziploc bags for so many things from storing small items to food that I buy in bulk. I have always like to storing things in ziploc it saves space and I can part one chicken breast in a quart bag and just take out how many I need without defrosting the whole package. I even bought ziploc quart bags in bulk so I never run out.

I sometimes use the freezer bags to pipe out frosting onto my cupcakes when I am in a bind and have run out of pastry bags!

I use small Ziplocs to hold my empty printer cartridges to be carrie3d in my bag to the stationary store for recycling purposes. This is the way that they can be transported in my purse with out leaking!
 Tamara 
wow, pick a favorite, thats hard. I’ve used almost all the suggestions before. I put my sons extra set of clothes in a ziplock bag for school. Probably my favorite would have to be: when we buy a new bag of dog food, we put it in a large ziplock bag to keep it fresh and keep out bugs.
 Dawn Puskas 
When I take my grandson out for the day, I pack Ziploc bags with wipes and utensils. They keep the wipes fresh, and I have a place to put his dirty spoons after he eats.
 Cathy 
When dieting, I use Ziploc bags for portion control. I can buy in bulk to save money and still get the benefit of self prepared 100 calorie snacks or a single serving of vegetables.
 Robyn 
Like many others, I use Ziploc to re-package bulk foods, keep cookies fresh (even resealable original packages just don’t do it), store a wide variety of organic and inorganic items, hold toiletries for air travel. My most recent new use was to store a day’s portion of food and treats for our dog for each day she spent at a kennel recently.
 Dayene Fritz 
I buy large packages of meat when it is on sale. Then when I get home I cook with some of it and then place the other in meal size portions in the Ziploc Freezer bags to defrost and use later. That way in my freezer I have meat ready to be cooked at a lower price than just going to the store and buying meat to cook a meal with. Nice and simple.
 terrymike 
I use them to store cooked, diced chicken meat that I prepare in the freezer so that all I have to do is thaw one and I can make dinner or have it ready to make fresh chicken salad. Yum!!
 Diane Sallans 
To send leftovers home with everyone after a big family dinner!!
 madge 
I store religious Holy Cards and small prayer books in a large ziploc and use a smaller ziploc to take some of the prayers with me when going away. Keeps everything together in an easy to find place.

i LIKE THIS IDEA that was above: To create a great mat to kneel or sit on in the garden, stuff a large Ziploc Big Bag with two inches of newspaper; then seal.
I often use ziplock bags to pack up personal items. It’s easy to use organize them when I housesit.
 Nancy K. Collyer 
I put reusable ice packs in ziplocks. After several uses these packs can leak leaving a blue stain. The ziplock prevents the mess and allows me to use the packs longer.
 Yen Nguyen 
3. Store your travel toiletries in Ziploc quart-sized bags. I like to place each toiletry item in a smaller sandwich bag and then put all of those into the larger to avoid any messy spills from the airplane ride.

That is my favorite ziplock tip of the ones listed above.
 April Smith 
We buy large bags of chips or cookies and break them up into reasonable sized servings in Ziplock snack bags. The kids are allowed one serving a day. Otherwise they wouldn’t stop eating until all the chips were gone. This is helpful for keeping me on my diet as well.
 Kristy 
We buy in bulk then break everything down into ziplocks! Saves us a ton!
 Diane Upchurch 
To bread your chicken strips or other meat before you fry them put your flour and spices in a ziploc bag add your chicken shake,then fry when your done throw away the bag-no mess-it easy!

We use ziplock bags in our restaurant to help keep portion control consistant, for fast and easy preparation.
 Nits 
Definately portion control.
 Lydia 
I used Ziploc bags for tons of stuff when I moved, especially for anything that could leak. I also wrapped my jewelry in tissue paper and then put the packets of wrapped jewelry into a Ziploc bag(s). The air in the bags provided extra cushioning. I transferred my rubber stamps to bags from plastic shoeboxes which kept them safe and organized and saved space in the packing boxes. ( The plastic shoeboxes were packed separately.) Those are jut a few of the ways I used Ziploc bags during my move.
 Shirley 
Keep yarn, sorted by project in Ziploc bags. This protects the yarn in case of flood or moth disaster, and keeps all of your projects together, so you’re not searching for that stray skein of yarn!

Halloween is coming ! Use Ziploc snack bags to make up small goodie bags to hand out to Trick or Treaters ==== put in some wrapped candy pieces, sticks of gum, a fun balloon, wax lips or teeth, etc.

I use ziploc bags on numerous occasions but my favorite is decorating a cake with icing. Just fill the small ziploc bag with cake icing, cut one small hole in the corner and start piping out. No messes and no clean up…..
 Sandra Wiley 
Great for having a spare change of clothes handy for the little ones“accidents”, dry clothes at the pool, change of clothes in the kindergarten backpack. Gallon size bag works for infants through elementary age kiddos! AND…you have a bag to put the dirty or wet clothes in. I’ve use this ideas for 7 staright years!
 Sandra Wiley 
Dirty diapers…no trash can in sight??? Have no fear, ziploc bags are here!!!
Roll up the dirty diaper and seal it with the tape from the diaper itself. Toss it in a quart sized ziploc, seal the bag and wahlah….no smell! It won’t stink up your bag or your car. Throw it away as soon as you find a trash can or when you arrive at your destination.
 Ruth 
I put travel size shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body spray in Ziploc bags to prevent spill in my make up tote bag. I have so many, many small stuffs everywhere so I put them all in it so won’t get it everywhere. Ziploc is a good brand and good qualify. Ziploc is the best!! :0) Good day!!!
 Shanna 
I use different sized bags to store toys and games with all the pieces together in one bag so nothing gets lost!

A perfectly dressed Caesar salad needs the dressing evenly dispersed over all the Romaine lettuce leaves. One trick I learned over the years is to put your lettuce in a gallon-sized Ziploc along with the amount of dressing you want to use. Then zip your bag almost closed. Blow in just a little bit of air to keep the bag inflated, close the rest of the way and SHAKE! Voila! A perfectly dressed Caesar salad.
 Jeanne 
I store all my excess pens and pencils in a ziplock.
 Ruth 
I use them for everything. I always carry one or two with me in my purse. You never know when you are going to need one. I prefer the freezer bags. They are“heavy duty.”
 Chamayne 
17. Store small amounts of paint in Ziploc storage containers to do quick touch-ups.
I took this a step further. I got some cheap sponge brushes and loaded them with paint and stuck the whole thing in a ziploc bag in the freezer. Paint stored in the garage changes over time and might not match after a year or two.
 Pam 
I use quart size Ziplock bags to hold my batteries for recycling vs. throwing them away. When the bag is half to almost full I take them to a store to recycle, then start over. :)
 Gina 
Wow! I have used all of these tips except for the bubble wrap and the kneeling pad–I must say that the bubble wrap one is so exciting that I’m going to do it this Tuesday with my niece–she’ll absolutely love this!

On the map front–we also hike and backpack a lot–so we store our trail maps flat in a large ziplock so that they stay safe when we’re hiking in the rain.
 DeeDee Cronic 
For icing cupcakes and filling deviled eggs. Pretty design&amp;practical.
 Rachel 
I’m part of a baseball league for children with special needs, The Miracle League of Michigan, and we use Ziploc gallon bags to distribute uniform hats and shirts to 300 players each season. I write the player’s name and uniform size in the white label area, and the bags batched together by team. Works PERFECTLY!!
 Brittany 
I use gallon bag filled with tempera paint for my students to practice tracing letters and shapes. They love it and when they are done, simply wipe the letter away with the side of the hand and start over.

I separate McDonald’s toy sets, so my kids can find the whole set at one time.
 joy 
I use them when I’m reading a book that I want to take along with me(traveling, to the lake, to work, whatever). It keeps the book safe from anything that might be leaky in my bag(soda,sunscreen,etc)and also keeps it from getting all banged up and scrunched edges. If you use it when you’re by a pool or on a beach, you can even read through the bag(keep the book sealed inside) to save it from splashes or sand….
 Leah R 
I use them to store everything–baby formula, cookies, noodles, leftovers…! They make a really well as icing bags too :)
 Leticia Juarez 
Ziplocks are my life savers for everything! Although they have several uses in my house I believe my favorite is using them for ground beef. Ground beef always comes in that big roll so I cut it up, place each cut section in the small sandwich bags then put all the bags in a large freezer bag. They are always preserved nicely like that and no frost bite. But whoa I can go on about how I use Ziplock! :)
 Jo Graeber 
When I take the kids to a movie, we buy the large popcorn, but you get refills with it! When seated, we get out the Ziploc bags and put popcorn in each of the bags and had out to the kids. It’s just to inconvenient when not all the kids can sit by me, so they each get their own bag of popcorn in a Ziploc bag. Any leftovers go home in my purse for later.

I could not find a denture brush older (like toothbrush holders) in any store, so I keep my denture brush in Ziploc bag. Stays sanitary, fits great, and is easily taken on the go.

For some reason my credit cards don’t always want to go thru the card machines at the register! I keep a Ziploc in my purse for just such occasions. Just slip the card into the bag, down in the corner, and then swipe the card again. Voila! It goes right through.

As soon as I get home from the store with brown sugar, I immediately put the sugar into a Ziploc bag—along with three marshmallows. You could use more or less, but three works for me just fine. This keeps the brown sugar from getting hard, leaving it soft and ready to use in your recipes.

I don’t even own any rubber gloves! So when I need to clean something, I just slip a Ziploc bag over each hand, or at least the right one, and clean away, using it as my glove.

I always keep Ziploc bags in my purse. Having teen girls,“I”always carry a tampon and pad (for their emergencies), plus small Ziploc for used ones until she gets to a trash can.

Anyone else out there remember the days BEFORE Ziploc bags? I do, which makes me appreciate them all the more for their versatility and convenience. I use storage and freezer Ziploc bags in all the sizes for a multitude of uses throughout the home. I do not use any prepackaged“mixes”so must store a lot of various flours, grain and pasta products–everything goes into a Ziploc bag to protect the item from those pesky bugs that love to devastate your pantry. I picked up some more good ideas for Ziploc’s today.

When grinding my coffee in the morning, any excess goes directly into a Ziploc bag or container. Keeps it nice and fresh for the next time.
 Kay 
I use them for just about anything that fits and to group like items together so that I can see what they are.
 Renee Smith 
I love all the tips!!! they all come in very handy I guess if I had to pick my favorite it would be to store dirty clothes after leaving the beach or working out. That way the stinky socks etc stay inside the bag and not all over my other stuff too ! Thanks Ziploc!!!!
 Tina Greco 
I always take a couple sandwich-sized Ziploc bags in my purse when my hubby and I go out to a restaurant. If we don’t eat all the bread or rolls they give us with dinner, I put them in my sandwich bags and take them home to enjoy later.
 shannon 
I use the large freezer“Zippy”bags as an instant sterile hot water bottle for aches and pains. First I take a T-towel and dampen it enough where it is not dripping. I insert it into the freezer bag, remove additional air, zip it closed, pop it into the microwave for approximately 3 to 4 minutes and place it into a pillow case. I can then put this onto my aching lower back or whatever hurts for a few minutes to obtain the relief I am in need of. It works. Doesn’t leak. Doesn’t burn and can be re-heated if need be. Once I done with it, I remove the towel, throw it in the wash and I can reuse the bag!
 shannon 
I use the freezer Ziploc bags for putting crushed ice into and placing it inside of a pillow case to make an instant ice pack for relieving the swelling of a bruised, swollen or painful area on the body. There is no drip and it can easily be refrozen for the next time.

I put ground meat in a quart size freezer. Mash it flat an freeze.. It holds a little over a pound and thaws quick due to being flat.

I make up small Ziplock bags of ice from large bags of purchased ice so that my kids can grab just what they want without scattering ice throughout my freezer.

My niece had forgotten her contact case when she stayed the night at her friend’s house, so she used Ziploc baggies to store her contacts in. She just wrote an L for left and R for right on the bags, put in some contact solution with her contacts, and zipped them shut!
 Linda Danielson 
I used ziploc bags for my daughter’s doll shoes and other small accessories. Keeps them together and out of the vacuum cleaner.
I also use the large ziploc bags for dance recital, store accessories for each costume in its own bag and write on the bag the name of the costume. Makes dressing at recital much quicker and easier.

When my son in the Navy is deployed overseas, I send him boxes with snacks and personal hygiene items, all packed in lots of ziploc bags. I don’t have to worry about the food staying fresh, and if something leaks, I know everything else in the box won’t be ruined. Plus he could use the bags over and over to store things in on the ship, and doesn’t have to use up any extra of his valuable personal space with storage containers!!

I help Santa mail letters from the North Pole and with the letters, we mail small trinkets and gifts. Ziploc bags are great for sorting these gifts for easy access to make sure siblings get different keepsakes!! :)
 Patricia 
I work with a locksmith and we use the snack size bags for large rekey jobs. We mark the bags with the key codes and then put those specific keys in those bags. They help keep everything inorder and pervents me from having to try hundreds of keys to find which ones goes to which lock.

snack bags for my son’s snacks at school.

Number 3 is my favorite tip. I do this every time I travel! It works great to keep messy things from spilling all over my bag.
 Cathie 
#3–I use Ziploc bags all the time for marinading all types of foods.
 JT Keri 
Fill with water and freeze. Make great“ice pillows”, perfect for consistently chilling punch in punch bowls…and no one stealing the ice before it’s done its job! ;-)
 Ar Foster 
As a disabled woman, I have a lot of trouble dropping things…I’m talking 10-20 times a day! I’m also a crafter, painter, and collage journalist, so I deal with lots and lots of tiny objects, beads, ribbon, feathers, ephemera, you name it. I always worry about losing small, cherished“invaluable”items when I lose my grip, so I turn to my trusty Ziploc bags in several sizes to prevent spills and lost treasures. Sure, I could go to a craft store and buy any number of plastic storage bags, but I simply don’t have the money to do that, especially when I can use Ziploc bags, which costs me a LOT LESS. I usually buy the gallon size in the largest quantity per package—stretching my dollars even further—but keep a few boxes in different sizes to place them in my office/craft room, kitchen, bedroom, and bath: just like my tissue boxes.
 Chrissy 
I sell books and other items on eBay. Whenever packing something to ship, I seal it in a Ziplock bag for extra protection from moisture and whatever else it might encounter en route. Items are kept safe and clean, and buyers are kept happy!
 http://Alice.com Judy M Dugan 
Number 7–I would warm the socks in the microwave first and then slip on the zip lock then the boots.
 Jeanne 
Ever struggle with filling half-eggs for deviled eggs? Struggle no more! I use a sandwich size Ziploc bag! Place the yolk mixture in the bag, cut a small opening in one of the bottem corners and pipe the egg filling into the egg halves! You’ll have no mess and no waste. Works just like the frosting tip!
 Jeanne 
I use a big Ziploc bag when packing for a trip. I put all my lingerie in the bag, zip the top until just about closed, then press all the air out! Sometimes I actually stand on the bag. Then just zip the very end and volia–you have a vaccumed packed bag with your delicates all in one place. Won’t be spilling out all over airport security should they choose to search your bag.
 Lana 
#7, can’t wait to try this year.
 Pat Thomas 
I’ve used several of these ideas for Ziplock bags, but my favorite remains the boy scout boil-in-bag omelette!
 Katie 
I like using ziplock for messy food jobs (especially where it calls for crushed items, like cookies or for coating items like breading chicken.) It makes the clean-up SO much easier!!
 Rebecca 
If I was stranded on an island, the one thing I would want is Zip Lock Bags–I use them in every size for EVERYTHING. I carry them in the car, and diaper bag too. They are great for the beach. One of my favorite uses prevents lettuce from wilting. After washing lettuce, I dry it, roll it in a paper towel, then put it in a zip lock. Remove all the air and the lettuce will keep and be fresh and crunchy! Saves me money, time and aggravation.
 Cindy 
I use the single serve size containers to give frozen food to my elderly parents. this way they don’t have to make those foods that are easier made in large amounts. Also they don’t have too cook as often.
 http://alice.com Regina Ferguson 
Ziploc bags ans containers can be used to put small toys in so you can keep up with them,and to store snacks in,and to put your cosmetics in so they dont get lost in your purse.
 Lori 
I love the gallon Ziploc bags. I always use them when I travel. They are especially convenient when traveling with small children. I put a whole outfit into one bag and label it with the day of the week this way it’s a no-brainer in a rush. Not to mention an easier way for kids to keep track of their own colored pencils and toys in the carry-on bags.
 Megan 
Use it to fill cupcake tins! Fill a gallon sized bag with cake batter and then snip the tip–then use it to fill up each cupcake without dripping any batter! Especially helpful when making mini cupcakes!
 Rebecca Hollfelder 
I use quart storage bags as pastry bags.
 Christina 
I like the idea to marinate meat in a Ziplock bag! Great idea. I also love the above poster’s idea to use as a heat pack for her back.
 Janelle Gilbert 
I use gallon size bags to keep Christmas lights safe. After wrapping strands around cardboard I put them into gallon Ziploc and then layer the bags in a box. I never have to fight with tangles lights, as light sets are kept separate from each other in storage.
 Rocio Carlson 
I use them to organize my scrapbook items. I label each bag by project (i.e. Baby’s first year) and whenever I come across an item I would want in that book I put it in the bag until i’m ready for that project.
 Aaron 
I always use Ziploc bags for air travel with toiletries and also as cheap space bags when traveling as you can seal them most of the way and then roll all the air out.
 Donna Gilbreath 
I’m a quilter. I use the large 2-gallon Ziploc bags to store my various quilting projects. Each project–including the pattern, fabric, embellishments–is stored in its own Ziploc project bag. When i’m ready to work (or resume work) on a particular project, I can just grab that Ziploc bag, and know I have everything i need.
 http://Alice.com Marty 
I like to use sandwich size bags to store seeds and pkgs. of seeds. I can write what type of seeds are in the bag and the date I saved them.
 Colette 
I’ll thaw meat in a Ziploc bag to keep the package from leaking in the refrigerator. But my favorite thing; used Ziploc bags can be used to seal the styrofoam meat trays in before they go into the garbage. I don’t have to toss a half full garbage can because of the smell anymore!
 Gayle 
I put my spinach, chard, and kale in Ziplock freezer bags. Then I freeze these greens to crush and make green smoothies!
 Patricia 
I never go on a trip without various sizes of zip lock bags in my suitcase–both the ones that I have packed stuff in and empty ones for back-up.
 Mary Jo 
Ziploc bags are great for storing all the bits and pieces for craft projects.
For in instance when I cut out the pieces for a quilt block, I store them in a Ziploc bag.
 Tammi 
I always keep an extra set of clothes in a larger Ziploc bag in my car for my Grandchildren. Then when we are out and about and accidents occur (especially food and drinks), I have a fresh, clean set of clothing in a compact bag…I then can use the bag to place the dirty clothes in so it contains any mess!
 Leelee 
The x-large ziploc bags work great for storing my sheets, blankets in our camper, get home from camping wash, dry repack in Ziploc, ready for our next trip…Fresh as just taking out the dryer! thanks ziploc
 http://ALICE.COM BECKY 
WHEN I HAVE SMALL AMOUNTS OF LEFTOVER VEGETABLES FROM DINNER I PUT THEM IN SMALL ZIPLOC BAGS. WHEN I HAVE 2 OR 3 I COMBINE TO MAKE MIXED VEGETABLES.
 tsantillo 
I eat salads every day, sometimes twice a day! To make prep time faster, I rinse my veggies when I get home from the grocery store, then store them in gallon size Ziploc bags with a paper towel to control moisture.
 Brenda 
My favorite tip that I read was the one where you use a ziploc for your wet umbrella. I have never heard this before, very helpful, and so simple. Cannot believe I didn’t think of it myself. I also use them for all of my son’s football small items in his bag. His ear-pads, mouth guard, black under eye stuff, tape….otherwise you are forever hunting for these things in his bag.
 Lesli 
I use Ziplocs for almost everything, but the large size is great for sending extra clothes to my son’s daycare and to keep in our vehicle just in case, and I like the storage containers for organizing his art supplies—especially after he’s torn the crayon box!
 http://theveedubs.blogspot.com Kristi 
I like to use Z-bags to pack up my son for a weekend at Grammi and Poppi’s. I use the bigger bags for bath items, and the smaller ones to organize things like toothpaste/brush, vitamins, medicine, etc. That way, my Mom doesn’t feel overwhelmed by all his“stuff”and can keep it contained!
 glen gilbert 
use as a pill container on over nite or weekend trips. put your paintbrush in the bag when you have to quit for the day. next day get it out and start painting again. no muss no fuss.
 http://Alice.com Linda Lyons 
I use Ziploc bags for my sugar and flour. Keeps them dry and also from making a mess. I also use Ziplock bags for traveling-great for shampoo and other items that may leak!
 http://nellabells.blogspot.com/ Janelle F 
I use Ziploc bags every morning to bring dry cereal to work! I don’t have time to eat at home, so I grab a Ziploc bag with cereal and a travel mug of skim milk and am able to sit back and enjoy my breakfast while catching up on email!
 Carey Hare 
We recently had a yardsale and used Ziplock bags to organize the items for sale and mark the prices on the bags. For instance, my kids were selling their duplicate silly banz–we put four in a bag, wrote the theme and the price. Easy!
 Joanne Byron 
Number 23 is GREAT! I also use Ziploc bags when I travel. Large Ziplocs are perfect to put your clothes in. Then you roll them up by the bottom and squeeze out the air, zip it closed and watch how much space you have! It also is great to pack some extra Ziploc bags in your suitcase in case you have wet clothing.
 mary adiutori 
When traveling I put each days pills in a snack size bag and label with a sharpie pen. No mixups that way!
 http://alice.com Gayle Harvey 
I’m know in my family as the ziploc queen I use them for everything. We recently moved and it was really helpful when we were taking the Entertainment Center shelves and glass doors off to put the screws/bolts etc. in a Ziploc bag and mark what item they went too. We had several different pieces of furniture we did this with. It sure was easier when we had to put them back together.
 kelli naegeli 
Use a snack sized Ziploc for salad dressings or salsa’s when packing a lunch.
 Sarah D 
When we go camping, my kids love collecting all sorts of‘finds’from around camp. I just give them ziploc bags to keep their collections in, and they love it! Since you can see through them to compare what each has found, they can look to their hearts desire…plus I don’t have to worry about things going into pockets and winding up in the laundry.
 Karen 
When we moved the office, every piece of cabling for each computer setup, and all parts were put in ziplock bags and marked with sharpies. At the other end it was a breeze to reassemble the computers and we were up and running in no time.
 Melissa 
I use ziploc bags for storing everything from receipts to little toys in my diaper bag to dry cereal for the kids when I need to pull out a quick snack.
 Beth Smith 
I keep all of my makeup items in my purse in a Ziploc bag. It saves hunting for my lipstick in the bottom of my bag, and I’m always ready for airport security if I have to fly on a moment’s notice for work.
 Heather 
I use them to sort each day of clothing for my daughter on vacation including socks and undies. This way we don’t make it to the end of the vacation with her crying that nothing matches or she is out of socks.
 Barbara 
I have a GREAT use. A Ziploc is a GREAT omelet maker. Take all of the ingredients that you’d like in your omelet, eggs first, and put them in a ziploc bag. Roll up the bag so that it looks like a plastic covered burrito. Put it in the microwave and voila. Instant Omelet—with NO oil, butter, or even PAM!!
 Kim 
Ziploc bags are perforct for greasing pans as well as storage. I use them when I am making Bread and have to grease lots of pans, and when you are done you can turn them inside out so there is no mess on the counter .
 http://none Cheryl 
I am letting you know my favorite tip for Ziploc in the comments to win a Ziploc Variety Box full of Ziploc bags and containers!
I use them (see #13) to marinate chicken, beef and pork…no mess with easy clean up.
 FIFSTER33 
I use them all the time, but my best tip….we raft a lot and love taking our music on the ipod! We have a lil music speaker, battery operated, so we just put our ipod and speaker in a lil ziploc and then put the lil one inside a Big one, just in case. water and electronics don’t mix, so we want to be extra careful. The music plays great through the baggies and we’re all happy and dry! :)
 http://Alice.com Rachel Wyrick 
Picking up poo, turn them inside out and then after you pick up, you can zip it!
 Abby Fleming 
I love marinating meat in a Ziploc bag! Just pour in all your sauces and spices along with your meat! I use this all the time. It’s fabulous!
 Cynthia Woods 
We used Ziplocs to keep our birth certificates in on vacation out of country recently. It was great. Also have used as ice packs.
 Sheri 
I use Ziploc bags to store birthday cards and other cards that my children receive throughout the year. When I go to scrapbook the holiday they receive the card for, I attach the whole bag to the layout so all of the cards are kept neatly in one place.
 Stella Hwang 
When I last moved and had to take apart all of my furniture, I used Ziploc bags to keep all the screws and little pieces together and taped the sealed Ziploc bag to the piece of furniture itself. No more searching for that missing screw!

Also, since I got a new puppy recently, I use a ZIploc bag to hold her extra-special stinky treats when we do training outside in very distracting environments. I can easily keep the bag in my pocket for easy access, but throw any leftover treats back in the fridge in the sealed Ziploc bag and it doesn’t stink up the fridge!
 Andrea 
We use Ziploc for EVERYTHING!!! I have a Ziploc in my son’s diaper bag for his dirty clothes (in case we are out and he stains his onsie) and one for his spoon and fork. When he was smaller, I had to leave him with my mom for a couple of days, and so I labeled each ziploc with the day, and I also packed his baby Vick’s Vaporrub with the instructions right on the bag! There was no need to waste paper, and I reuse the bags when we travel with him (Since they are already labeled)!

I also use them for wipes in the car and to store food in the freezer and fridge. My mom uses it for her iPhone when we go to the beach, and I store my phone and iPod as well in the ziplocs…keeps the sand out. And of course, We use them sunscreen, so it isn’t all over the beach bag! We love Ziplocs!!!
 Debra Heigl 
I use your ziploc sandwitch bags every day. Thay are good to put candy for my atisket grand son ,and a wet wash cloth ,to it is good to get the box tops for are local school. An if i need any ziplocs item you have Iwill buy them over other brands I love your small and big bags and contaners .
 Kathy Wilson 
I use all the sizes of Ziploc bags that there are. When winter is over, I store the drapes in big bags and get out the summer curtains. Also use the big bags to store rugs. When traveling I put shoes in ziploc bags, and anything I don’t want someone to touch that may open my bags and search them at the airport.
 Debby U 
I use Ziploc bags all the time for about everything but I think my favorite is when we go camping.(with Girl Scouts) we put a day’s clothes in a Gallon Size Ziploc bag for each day we are camping…If you ever been camping and have gotten rained on and everything in your tent has gotten wet, then you know how important dry clothes are….Ziploc bags rule!!
 Mandy 
What’s your favorite or best Ziploc tip?

I love buying meat in bulk (namely bacon) then separating it into portions and freezing it. That way, not only does my food last longer, but I have the perfect portion ready to go whenever I am ready to cook :-)
 http://DoubleDiamondAgent.com Jack Murphy 
I use it for just about anything that I have that either needs to stay clean or dry……
 J. Zimmermann 
I use the snack bags to cover open yogurt containers that the kids don’t finish in one sitting. I also use the larger gallon sized bags to store little game pieces or toys. I use the quart sized bags for snacks, or for holding crayons and markers in my purse or diaper bag when we go places. I also use the freezer bags for what they are made for…the freezer. We always make more pancakes or more muffins and then store them in a gallon sized ziploc freezer bag.
 http://conniescapers.blogspot.com Connie LaRayne Sheppard 
I love to do scrapbooking, and often have little scraps of usable paper left over. I use ziploc bags to sort them by basic color, and then store them neatly in a drawer. I also use ziploc bags for brads, and other decorative trim, lace, stamps, etc. You can see what’s in them, and they store neatly.
 Karen 
The bags are perfect for storing dried seeds from garden plants, for next years seed starting! Keep the seed fresh, and the bags are of course so easy to label.
 http://site4teachers.blogspot.com Crystal Heyland 
You can spray the inside of a ziploc container with non-stick spray so that dark foods that spaghetti and macaroni and cheese do not stain the container.
 Shelly Mousseau 
I like to use the gallon size bags to sort on-going knitting projects so that they don’t get all tangled together.
 Andrea Watts 
21. Make bubble wrap by inflating a Ziploc with a straw.
 Pam Colsten 
My friends and I donated 60 bags of homemade playdough to food pantries in our area for Easer. I measured the flour and salt in each bag and gave the zipped bags to everyone. They added water and food coloring, pushed out the air and zipped back up. Then they kneaded the dough until it was the correct consistency. NO MESSY HANDS!!! It would work great for other things like meatloaf also.
 Tracy 
Ziploc bags are amazingly wonderful at holding water and freezing water on warm or hot days.
 http://Alice.com Kathy Johnson 
I LOVE Ziploc bags for board game pieces. Monopoly is a perfect example.
 Connie Faulkner 
I like No 3 and 4 storing travel toiletries and jewelry
 http://Alice nicole H 
No 10: Toy organization also keeping things together when traveling.
 Robin 
We use them to organize toiletries when traveling, keeping small toy/game pieces together, for lunches and for storing“dry”leftovers (piece of meat, tomatoes, onions, etc)
 CapitolMom 
Of the ideas listed above, 19 is my favorite. Nothing is happier than buttercream frosting&amp;Ziplocs!

I also use Ziplocs to store old cell phones with their chargers (&amp;any other accessories). This came in handy when my husband’s phone died&amp;we were a month away from his upgrade. Pulled out the old phone, charged it&amp;ported his number–trauma averted!
 Jodi M 
I use Ziploc baggies for all sorts of things…packing all of my jewelry, toiletries and feminie products when goig on vacation. Packing almost anything to keep the items together but yet seperated–they ROCK! I also use the snack sized baggies as a collection bag for cash and checks when my kids do fundraisers and things…the bills and checks fit in the baggies perfectly!
 Heather 
I use ziplocs for just about everything! With two small children, there are tons of toys with small parts that need to be contained! We put puzzles, dolls, hotwheels pieces and more in ziploc bags and containers. I also use the big ziploc bags to store outgrown clothing and stuffed animals.
Snacks for the car, toys, markers and crayons with coloring books go in a ziploc for the car. And of course, the containers are a staple in the lunchbox!
 http://www.cookielee.biz/danetteoconnell Danette 
I also use ziploc bags for all of my childs’small toy pieces, puzzle pieces, crazons, hair ribbons, etc.
When I travel, I take my own ziploc bag of tea and another one of sugar so that I can have my morning tea in the hotel room!
 Judie Schmelzinger 
I put mr beauty items in a ziploc to prevent leaks when I travel (lotions, shampoo, makeup, nail polish,etc.)
 http://www.supercoupongirl.com Beeb Ashcroft 
My favorite Ziploc tip is to wash them out and re-use them! Thank you for the giveaway!
 Kristin 
My son has a serious heart defect that requires several different medications, special formula and feeding supplies, oxygen tubing, and more! It’s so nice to have all his medical supplies separated into Zip-loc bags and labeled, especially when it’s time to go to Gramma’s house! Everything is easy to identify and find.
