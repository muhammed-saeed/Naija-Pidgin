 of 1855    Anthony Chukumba - “I wouldn&apos;t say that there is a definite shift in how people are furnishing their homes and that&apos;s why Pier 1 is lagging. Pier 1 has made missteps in merchandising, in its store layout and advertising. It really could take a management shakeup to fix things now for Pier 1.”       Anthony Brown - “This new mega-concept of advertising through pixel ad space is very quickly becoming an artistic and commercial discussion platform destined to have its own place in World Wide Web history. Your advertisement will not only occupy a prime piece of cyberspace real estate for the next three years, but, it will also be replicated on t-shirts, postcards, mouse pads, coffee mugs lithographs and even a book.”       Baris Cetinok - “There are several different options, which we will essentially offer for free by using advertising support to cover costs. The ads will only appear in the Member Center of Office Live. Customers can also host advertising from different vendors on their Web sites. Microsoft will not step in between.”       Bernadette Murphy - “We&apos;ve been talking about a recovery in advertising. Well, R.R. Donnelley does the advertising for the Yellow Pages and it has a 3 percent yield, ... It&apos;s selling at a relatively low multiple and a 17 times earnings multiple for &apos;03 and I think it is a stock that individuals can look at.”       Ben Wilcox - “Bush raised money up to that level, then stopped and allowed the party to take over the funding of the campaign and the advertising. After that point, public financing in Florida has not really been doing what it was meant to do in the beginning.”       Barbara Ryan - “I don&apos;t think that DTC advertising is a bad thing I just think in some instances it went too far.”       Barbara Ryan - “Merck and Pfizer would probably lose money from a moratorium. They have portfolios that would benefit from DTC advertising.”       Barbara Ryan - “I don&apos;t think that DTC advertising is a bad thing I just think in some instances it went too far,”       Barbara Ryan - “Merck and Pfizer would probably lose money from a moratorium, ... They have portfolios that would benefit from DTC advertising.”       Bill Herrle - “The reality is retailers will not increase their inventories or order advertising until the governor does sign the bill.”       Bill Herrle - “Our retailers will not increase their inventory or advertising until this is signed. We need to get this on the governor&apos;s desk as soon as possible.”       Bill Gross - “This radically changes advertising. It makes it much more accountable.”       Bill Wyman - “Companies spend twenty, thirty, forty percent of revenues on advertising to brand their product and to get, essentially, acquire customers cheaply. You get a lot of exposure on something like this.”       Bill Whitman - “The discussion is on how to enhance the uniform to better reflect the essence of our advertising and marketing efforts and to create uniforms that are more contemporary and in line with the spirit of our &apos;forever young, forever fun&apos; campaign,”       Bill Dreher - “Target has the best advertising marketing campaign in retailing. They do an amazing job of elevating a discount store to a very cool destination shop and so they are always pushing the envelope.”       Bill Dreher - “I think it all comes down to Wal-Mart&apos;s aggressive advertising campaign. They are being much louder with their campaign, and I think they&apos;ve done a good job of stealing the &apos;early-bird&apos; holiday shoppers.”       Bill Threlkeld - “It&apos;s mostly the weather, but there may be other issues. It&apos;s been around a little longer, there is more advertising through word of mouth.”       Bill Squadron - “There&apos;s a major change going on in the whole advertising community. It has to do with the fact that, traditionally, people are not watching 30-second commercials.”       Bill Carroll - “Advertisers work on the premise that younger people haven&apos;t established a brand preference yet haven&apos;t decided on a car, haven&apos;t decided on a fast food restaurant, and that they are more likely to be influenced by advertising. Whereas older viewers have already chosen their brand of toothpaste.”       Bill Rogers - “I suspect it&apos;ll have more impact on the advertising arena than the news arena.”       Bill Roedy - “Frank has been a leading force in building our international businesses since joining the launch team in Europe 18 years ago when we set up our international operations. In Europe, he drove the creation of a pan-regional advertising market, enabling MTV Networks Europe to consistently exceed business plan.”       Bob Fuller - “It&apos;s the Holy Grail for advertising,”       Bob Davis - “Most of our revenue comes from advertising, and this was a great advertising quarter, ... We saw more and more companies come online. We have, right now, 21 of the Fortune 50 companies online with us today, and it&apos;s pretty solid.”       Boyd Peterson - “The larger trend is the combination of using the Internet as an advertising vehicle and then portable devices as a way of extending that presence.”       Botsalo Ntuane - “No newspaper can survive without advertising.”
