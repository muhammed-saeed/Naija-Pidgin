 Low Carb Shirataki Noodle Italian Style Spinach Pasta Recipe: New Twist On An Old Dish 

Comments (3) |
 
Tuesday, July 10, 2012 
 
 
Love pasta but not the carbs? Then Shirataki noodles might be your new best friend! I recently discovered this low-carb pasta equivalent! Don&apos;t 
let the tofu in the name scare you away from this delicious product. Shirataki 
noodles are traditional Japanese noodles made of tofu and yam 
flour. They look like noodles, feel like noodles, and have pretty much 
no flavor. But! There are only 20 calories in a half cup 
serving! While they obviously work great in Asian recipes, I love to use them to make Italian style pasta.
There are few things more comforting than an over-sized bowl of Italian love.


 
Shirataki
 noodles are available in most Asian supermarket in the refrigerated section. They can be prepared in stir fries, 
pastas, soups, salads or any of your favorite ways to eat pasta. Best 
part is they are very low in calories and really high in fiber! 
 Shirataki Noodle Nutritional Facts Serving Size: 4 oz Calories: 20 Fat: 0.5 Carbs: 3g Protein: 1g Fiber: 2g 
 This is where I part ways with traditional pasta. Ciao pasta! Konnichiwa Shirataki Noodles! 
 Ingredients 
 1 packet of shirataki noodles (spaghetti shaped) 1 large onion,finely chopped 2 cups (6 oz) raw spinach, chopped 4 Italian chicken sausages, diced  1 teaspoon olive oil 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped Parmesan cheese Salt and pepper 1/3 cup half and half 
  Preparation 
 Thoroughly rinse rice shirataki noodles until odorless, meaning until it has no tofu smell. (Follow instruction on package) In a medium sized skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add garlic and 3/4 onion, sautee until fragrant for about 3 minutes. Put in spinach and stir fry for another 3 minutes until it softens.  Mince the garlic, onion and spinach in a food processor. Add salt, 
pepper and 1/2 cup of half and half. Blend until the mixture is
 creamy and smooth. C ook sausage pieces and the rest of the onions over medium heat until sausage is no longer pink . Stir in noodles and spinach sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve hot . 
 Husband Says : &quot;I hate tofu. Alright, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but I definitely don&apos;t CHOOSE to eat it when I have the choice. But when it comes to Carmen Dishes, I pretty much eat whatever is put in front of me. In this case, she did warn me that the pasta was made of tofu. It was good. I enjoyed it. This is a very clever dish and pretty unique. I ate an entire plate and it wasn&apos;t too filling. Felt great. I could use more dishes like this as I don&apos;t want the ol&apos; tummy getting too round. That would be bad. So, for all of the skeptic fellows out there, this is pretty damn good. Can&apos;t complain.&quot; 



 
 4th Of July Special: Paint The Drink Red, White And Blue 

Comments (7) |
 
Wednesday, July 4, 2012 
 
 The Fourth of July brings countless celebrations from 
coast-to-coast across the US. During this festive time, we stop to think about America’s birthday, and give thanks for our
 freedom, and in my case, a green card! It is also a perfect dessert holiday, just think of all the fresh fruit 
possibilities! Add a little red, white and blue to your 4th of July menu with this drink and salad. They are simple enough to be a crowd-pleaser, and tasty enough to be on the menu. Let Freedom Ring! 
 
 Red White and Blue Piña Colada  You can make this 4th of July style cocktail with or without alcohol. You can do this with any drinks of any color. Bottoms up! 
 
 Ingredients 
 
 Sobe Piña Colada drink (white) / Bacardi piña colada (for alcoholic version ) 
 Fruit Punch Gatorade (Red) Blueberry G2 (blue) 
 Preparation 

 Fill cup with ice all the way to the top. Pour
 the liquid with the highest sugar content into the cup (In this case, the piña Colada), filling it 
approximately 1/3 full. For the second layer, pour the second 
drink with the lower sugar content SLOWLY through the ice to fill 
approximately the second third of the glass full. It&apos;ll mix a little but it separates out again almost entirely. Finally, pour the 
sugar-free or lowest sugar drink SLOWLY through the ice 
 Berry salad with Goat Cheese Use seasonal berries for this refreshing salad, 
matching tangy goat cheese with sweet berries, lettuce and walnuts 
 
 Berry Goat Cheese salad with chicken 
 Ingredients 
 Salad 
 1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced 1/4 of lettuce, thinnly sliced 1 cup mixed seasonal berries, such as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries (we are using Strawberries and Blueberries) 1/4 cup walnuts, roughly chopped  2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 
 Dressing 
 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice 1/4 cup Olive oil 1/2 teaspoons sugar Salt and pepper 
 
Preparation

 Toss lettuce, walnuts, onions, berries and goat cheese in a large serving bowl. For the dressing, whisk together all ingredients.Taste and adjust seasoning. Drizzle 
dressing over salad. Serve 
immediately with meal of your choice. 
 Husband Says: &quot;So I love the drink. Gulped it down in no time. Non-alcoholic version that is. Have to try the alchy version next. Now, total honesty time. I&apos;m not a huge fan of fruit mixed with salad, so this really wasn&apos;t for me. But! Not to say it wasn&apos;t good, just didn&apos;t suit my tastes. For those of you out there that like a little mix and matchin&apos;, this would be a fun dish. To those fruit purists, maybe not. Now that I&apos;ve officially said I didn&apos;t go for one of my beautiful, wonderful, sexy, smart, talented (not enough kissing up yet), and love of my life wife&apos;s dishes, I must go take my licks. Here&apos;s to hoping I&apos;m allowed at the dinner table tomorrow. Wish me luck!&quot;


 
 

 

 
 Spinach, Bacon And Feta Filo Pie Recipe: Carmen Takes On (And Changes!) Jamie Oliver&apos;s Dish 

Comments (4) |
 
Monday, June 25, 2012 
 
 
You know sometimes you see something on TV which looks 
delicious but you know that if you recreated it at home it would look 
nothing like the tastiness you see? Well when I saw the spinach
 and feta filo pie recipe on Jamie Oliver’s show, 30 Minute&apos;s Meals , I thought exactly that. Challenge accepted!

I tried it at home last week and I’ve fallen in love with 
this pie! It’s quick and really easy to prepare and looks and tastes 
excellent. Simply delicious!!! I’d highly recommend it as a summer&apos;s afternoon lunch or evening dinner when you&apos;re looking to get a veggie fix.

Jamie&apos;s
 recipe is absolutely fantastic, but since my husband and I are both meat lovers, I added some bacon pieces into the recipe. Mmmm bacon. I have also increased 
the amount of cheddar cheese, and added one more egg to make the filling a bit
 richer. Still, I feel like a bit of a cheat posting this because it is 95% not of my invention. It’s a Jamie Oliver recipe. So to the man, I must give more kudos and love, you can find Jaime Oliver&apos;s original spinach and feta filo pie recipe here . 
 
 
 Ingredients 
 100g pine nuts 6 free range or organic eggs 300g feta cheese 70g Cheddar cheese 1 tablespoon dried oregano 6 pieces bacon, diced 1 lemon 400g prewashed baby spinach 1 x 270g pack of filo pastry 1/2 nutmeg  a tablespoon of Olive Oil 

 Preparation (See unmodified original version HERE ) 

   Put the pinenuts into a dry ovenproof frying pan 
to toast for 2-3 minutes, tossing occasionally.   Crack 6 eggs into a
 mixing bowl and crumble in 300g of feta. Grate in 70g of Cheddar. Add a
 pinch of pepper, a couple of pinches of dried oregano, zest of 1 lemon 
and a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the nuts are lightly golden, add them 
to the egg mixture and mix well.  Put
 the empty frying pan back on the heat, add a little olive oil and pile in the spinach. Gently push and move it 
around and add more as it wilts down. Make sure it doesn’t catch on the 
bottom and when there’s room, start adding the rest, stirring 
frequently. Meanwhile, take the pastry out of the fridge. Lay a 
large sheet of greaseproof paper, on the 
worktop, rub a little olive oil all over it, then scrunch it up and lay 
it out flat again. Arrange 4 filo pastry sheets in a large rectangle, 
overlapping at the edges, so they almost cover the paper. Rub some olive
 oil over them. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt&amp;pepper. Repeat until you have 3 layers. Don’t worry about any 
cracked bits.  Once the 
spinach is cooked, take the pan off the heat. Add the 
wilted spinach to the egg mixture and grate in½a nutmeg. Mix well. 
Carefully move the greaseproof paper and filo into the empty frying pan 
(or baking tray) 
so the edges spill over. Push it down into the sides of the pan, then 
pour in the egg mixture and spread it out. Fold the filo sheets over the
 top. (optional : Put the pan 
back on a medium heat for a couple of minutes to get the bottom 
cooking) put the try into the oven on the top shelf to cook for 18 to 
20 
minutes. 
 Husband Says : &quot;I&apos;m Popeye the sailor man! I&apos;m Popeye the sailor man! If I can&apos;t get me spinnaache! I won&apos;t even finnash! Because I&apos;m Popeye the sailor maaaan! Ehgehgehgehgeh! Hot balls I felt stronger after eating this. Alright, maybe not stronger per say, but definitely more...awesome. Or is it more Australian? I hope its more awesome. Carmen nailed Jaime (his dish! His dish!) with this one, and her modifications really put it over the top for me. I don&apos;t want plain, I want BACON and CHEESE and anybody that enjoys a bit of those things will love her tweaks. Give it a go. Its good.&quot;


    
 
 Anderson&apos;s Honey Cinnamon Walnut Butter Recipe: Made With Love 

Comments (7) |
 
Tuesday, June 19, 2012 
 
 
 Since our wedding at the beautiful Anderson Barngrover family walnut ranch in California, I have been inspired to create a recipe using Walnuts. 
 As well as being very tasty, w alnuts are good for you. They help you to feel better and look better too! Recent research has show walnuts have more antioxidants than any other popular nut, as well as healthy fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals. Walnuts are also a delicious source of omega 3 essential fatty acids. A quarter cup of walnuts provides 90% of the recommended daily allowance of these protective fats. 
 With the 3 bags of walnuts that dad sent us from the ranch, I made honey-cinnamon walnut butter for the first Manhattan Community Swap myself and my friend organized (Please check us out!) I am very happy to tell you that my walnut butter did very well, and I have recieved some great feed back. I name this recipe the Anderson Walnut butter, dedicating it to my wonderful Anderson family. 
 Ingredients 

 2 cups shelled walnuts 1 tsp cinnamon 2 tablespoon of Olive oil 2 tablespoon of water 6 tablespoon of honey Pinch of salt 
 Preparations 

 Put walnuts in a food processor fitted with the regular cutting blade. Process the nuts on liquify-whip setting. After about 30 seconds it will begin to resemble graham cracker crumbs. Add seasonings to the mix and adjust to personal taste.  Continue processing for another 2 minutes ( or 1 minute for a crunchier texture,) Keep walnut butter covered in the refrigerator. 
 Husband Says : &quot;The best of both worlds with this on. We used nuts from the family ranch, and my wife got to show off her cooking skillz. She used me as her taste tester for this, and I preferred my nut butter more on the sweet and cinnamony side. So recommend that there is some constant tasting during preparation. This is good stuff. Great for toast or bagel spread. Especial bagel spread. You also don&apos;t feel so guilty having a bagel with loads of butter and jam because this stuff is actually pretty healthy.&quot; 



 
 Hear! Hear! Jubilicious Coronation Chicken Salad Recipe 

Comments (6) |
 
Saturday, June 2, 2012 
 
 
 This weekend is the Queen&apos;s Diamond Jubilee: A celebration of Queen Elizabeth of England &apos;s 60th year on the throne. I was born in British Colonial Hong Kong and had spent many happy years in Britain, the image of Queen Elizabeth II is as familiar to me as a family member.

I always have tremendous admiration and respect for The Queen. She is a beautiful example of courage and strength , and throughout her life she adapted to the times with dignity. Even now that she is not my Queen anymore, I still have a special place in my heart for this strong and reassuring figure .

This famous Coronation Chicken recipe was invented to celebrate a young Queen Elizabeth upon her elevation to the British throne 60 years ago. The original recipe called for mango, but as my husband is allergic to mango (Husband says, &quot;Drat!). I based my recipe on the one that I found in Allrecipe.com . I have replaced the mango with apricot chutney and Lemon juice. I also added some heavy cream into the mayonnaise to make the sauce more creamy.

I hope you will enjoy this recipe. Have a Jubilicious weekend!

Ingredients:

 1 tbsp Olive oil  1 b cooked chicken, diced chopped 1 small onion, finely 1 tbsp mild curry powder 1 tsp tomato paste 1 tbsp red wine 125ml chicken stock 1 tsp sugar Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 cups mayonnaise 2 tbsp heavy cream, lightly whipped Salt and pepper to taste  1/2 cups Apricot chutney   

Preparation:

 In a small frying pan, heat the oil to hot but burning. Add onion and cook on a low heat for 3 minutes. Stir in curry powder and cook for a further 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste. Remove from the heat and stir in the red wine, chicken stock. Season with salt and black pepper return to the heat and bring to boil. Stir in the sugar followed by the lemon juice and simmer on a gentle boil for 5 - 10 minutes. and leave to cool. Add the curry sauce mixture to the mayonnaise, stir in the apricot chutney and cream.  Place the cooked chicken into a large bowl, pour sauce to coat the chicken. Serve with salad, in sandwiches, or as a filling for a baked potato.  
 Husband Says : &quot;You know, I wasn&apos;t sure about this one. I mean, chicken to celebrate The Queen? And cold curry like sauce and chicken over lettuce...hrm, my American sensibilities were tingling and firing warning shots across my red, white and blue synapses. But, my wife being the wonderful cook that she is, I gave it a go and by jove! It was good! I say, hear hear! Good show ol&apos;wife! I have officially celebrated The Queen with a dedicated dish, and enjoyed it. It was a good day.&quot;



 
 California Wedding: A Real Barn Burner With Family, Friends And Food

Monday, May 28, 2012 
 
   As some of you may have noticed, I&apos;ve been away from this blog for a little while, and there is a reason. My hubby and I were on a very special holiday in California the last 10 days. We were there for our long awaited wedding party (We registered in NYC last year, but we didn&apos;t have a party for family and friends until now). This trip was about, family and friends, great memorable food, and celebrating our marriage and the joys of everyday life.

 This was my first trip to California, and I fell head over heel in love with it. The weather, the people, the scenery. And at the heart of it the family and the love for great fresh food .  

We had a family barbecue on Mother&apos;s day, and Mum Alaina and Grandpa Al both made some pretty amazing food from their family recipe book. Mum Alaina made fresh pasta salad, chunky potatoes egg salad. Healthy and tasty. Grandpa Al made his signature barbecue beans and barbeque chicken and ribs. They were so delicious that I threw my wedding diet out of the window!

While in Linden, I had a chance to taste some of California&apos;s best agricultural offerings of fresh fruits and vegetables. I have to say, I have never tasted anything as good as the cherries we picked from the trees.

We had our rehearsal dinner at Tarantino&apos;s restaurant at Fisherman Wharf in San Francisco, The food was delicious with views to match. All the seafood was fresh and juicy. I tried their Mahi Mahi and it was meaty and perfectly cooked! Everyone was happy with their meals. They even gave us a complementary wedding cheesecake.

As for our wedding, we had De Vinci&apos;s for catering and the food was really good. De Vinci&apos;s has been a local favorite for 30 years, and they are famous for their handmade ravioli. They provided a variety of food at our wedding and their chicken was amazing. My favorite was the Italian salad with ranch and Italian dressing with the beans. It tasted really awesome with the sauce from the raviolis mmmmm

I have been to many incredible places in my life but i can honestly say this has to be the most amazing trip of my entire life. It was filled with love.


 Rehearsal Dinner At Tarantino&apos;s 

 Tarantino&apos;s best: Scallops with rice, Mahi Mahi, crab cakes, seafood platter 

 Judy Anderson&apos;s Yogurt chicken with fresh Asparagus 

 Grandpa Al&apos;s barbecue beans and Chicken, Mum Alaina&apos;s salads

 Blend all ingredients well, Pre-cook 2 Ibs pork baby back ribs Boil in water for 40 mintues Pre-cook chicken pieces- bake in 350 F for 30 minutes Baste ribs and chicken with sauce. While grilling baste often with the sacue 
 Husband Says : &quot;What can I say really? Most amazing trip ever? Yes. Great food? Most definitely. I have to say, you people don&apos;t know how lucky you are to get a chance at this chicken and ribs recipe. It is a true family creation that&apos;s been perfected over decades by our family master BBQer, grandpa Al. You owe it to yourself to give these a try. This recipe have never been made outside of the family, so if you do try them, know that you&apos;re also taking part in our family food tradition, and probably for the first time.&quot;



 
 Baja Fried Fish Tacos Recipe: Get your Taco Party Started! 

Comments (10) |
 
Saturday, May 5, 2012 
 
 Since I moved to the States last year, I have fallen head over heels in love with Mexican food. Glowing up in Asia and Europe, Mexican food is something I&apos;ve read about, but not really eaten .  The &quot;real deal&quot; Mexican food is just so fresh and rich, varied and delightfully colorful! Cinco de Mayo is just the best excuse for me to go crazy on Mexican food and margaritas ! So please pardon me for doing yet another Mexican recipe! 

 This recipe of Tacos de pescado (Taco of fish) originated in Baja California in Mexico, that&apos;s where it got its name from. I used this Baja fish taco recipe from Allrecipe.com as a guideline, and created my own, I also served my with a homemade cabbage and cilantro slaw salad instead of with tomatoes and cabbage, and the result came out fabulous! I hope you&apos;d like this as much as I do!  

 Ingredients 

 For the fired fish pieces 

 1 1/2 pounds boned, skinned firm, white-fleshed fish such as cod or tilapia 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt   Olive oil 6 -8 corn tortillas 
 For the Cabbage and Cilantro Slaw salad 

 6 cups finely shredded purple cabbage 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro   3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons Olive oil   1 tablespoon of Jalapenos salt to taste 
 Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl, and add salt to taste

 For Tartar Sauce 

 2 chipotles chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1 scallion, finely chopped 11/2 tablespoon fresh lime juice Salt 
Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth.
 

Preparation

 In a bowl, flour, and salt until well blended. In a medium size pan, heat up 1 inch of oil over medium-high heat; bring oil to 360°.  Dip fish pieces into beer batter one by one. Slide fish into oil, a few pieces at a time, and cook for 3 - 4 minutes or until golden. When done, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add a tortilla and warm for 10 to 20 seconds on each side. To assemble each taco, spread a spoonful of tartar sauce on a warmed tortilla. and top with 3 or 4 pieces of fish, then a spoonful of cabbage and cilantro slaw salad. Serve with tartar sauce and Lime wedges on side.  
 Husband Says : &quot;More Mexican food please. I LOOOVE fish tacos. Love em. Like, we&apos;re going to name our second born &apos;F.T.&apos; for Fish Taco Anderson. They won&apos;t get teased in school at all. Who would pick on a kid named Fish Taco? Anyhoo, these were great, as was the tartar sauce. Really creamy with a little kick to it. Don&apos;t need to put much of it on a taco for it to really enhance it! There needs to be more &apos;Mexican&apos; holidays.&quot;

Thursday, May 3, 2012 
 
 What better way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo fiesta than cooking some homemade Guacamole , Mexican Rice and serve with some cold cervezas ? I came across this tasty enchilada recipe on Allrecipes.com awhile and I figured there isn&apos;t a better time to try it out. I have added some tomato sauce and made a few adjustments to it. The result was fantastic!  
 
 
 This Saturday marks the150th anniversary of Cinco de Mayo. The official name of this holiday in Mexico is called  El Dia de La Batalla de Puebla (The Day of the Battle of Puebla), it marks Mexico&apos;s victorious win against the French in the Mexican State of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Do you know that Cinco de Mayo isn&apos;t a major holiday in Mexico? I t&apos;s actually a Mexican -American holiday . It has turned into a major holiday that everyone in the US, Mexican or not, have enjoyed celebrating. It&apos;s also a day people use as a license to overeat Mexican food. 
 
 Cook Time: 45mins 

 Estimated Cost: $10 

 Serves: 2-3 

 Ingredients 

 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon butter  8 oz. tomato sauce 1 onion, chopped 1 teaspoon chili powder 2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast 2 green chile peppers, chopped 8 (8 inch) flour tortillas Hot Sauce 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese 
 
 Preparation 

 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F In a small bowl mix the soup, tomato sauce and sour cream. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and chili powder, and saute until tender. Stir in the chicken, chile peppers , green pepper, 1/2 cup of cheese, soup mixture. Cook and stir until heated through.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, and place in a baking dish. Cover with taco sauce on top, and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.  
 Husband Says : &quot; Dame. More Mexican food! I like this trend! Carmen was nervous about this one as once again she knows I love my Mexican food. Happy to say this was delish as usual. Spicy, but not TOO spicy. Saucy, but not TOO saucy. Will eat again!&quot; 
 
 
 Cantonese Steamed Fish Recipe: Whole Tilapia On The Table! 

Comments (12) |
 
Saturday, April 28, 2012 
 
 This Cantonese-style steamed fish recipe is a real treat. I know most Americans are not too keen on eating a fish while its eyes stare sadly at them. But in Hong Kong, it is a tradition to serve the fish whole, including the head, tail, skin and bone and all. A whole fish signifies good luck, it represents family togetherness and completeness.   

 I wouldn&apos;t cook a fillet in the style of this recipe, it just wouldn&apos;t be the same. Keeping the fish on the bone helps to keep it extra moist and tender (like how meat kept on the bone is juicier). A healthy, simple, quick and tasty way to cook any whole fresh white fish. The smoking peanut oil finale is absolutely necessary to bring out the full flavors of the fish! 

 Steaming is a healthy and delicious way to cook fresh fish. You can taste the delicate, sweet natural flavor of the fish and its very easy to prepare. 


 Ingredients 

 1 -1 1/2 lb fresh fish, with the head and tail on (scales removed and insides cleaned)        2 tablespoon ginger sliced 4 tablespoons of peanut oil 1/4 cup scallions, julienned.  4 tablespoons soy sauce mixed 1/2 teaspoon sugar  
 Preparations 

 Wash and pat dry the fish with paper towel inside and out Place 1/3 of the gingers in a plate then place fish on top, place the 1/3 in the fish cavity and finally the 1/3 on the top. Add enough water to the wok then bring to the boil in high heat. When the water is boiling Place the plate on a steam rack in the wok then steam covered for 8-10 minutes After the fish is cooked, pile on the julienned scallion on the fish .  Heat up the oil, until it is so hot it&apos;s steaming, Pour the hot oil onto the fish. (The hotter the better to release the scallions&apos; flavor into the sauce.) Pour the soy sauce sugar mixture on top. Serve hot with hot steamed jasmine rice .  
 Husband Says : &quot;This is one of my favorite dishes. I learned to love full-headed fish dishes in Asia, and once you get over the sad fishy eyes staring at you its really no big deal. This is such a simple recipe, but is very flavorful. Trust me on this, leave the head on.&quot;



 
 Not So &apos;Desperate Housewife&apos;: Eva Longoria&apos;s Kitchen Is A Delightful Surprise 

Comments (15) |
 
Monday, April 16, 2012 
 

 
 
 I am a big fan of the TV show Desperate Housewives, so it really was &quot;a dream come true&quot; for me moment when I got the chance to meet my favorite star from the TV show, Miss Eva Longoria. She is beautiful and down-to-earth, and has a great sense of humor, just like her character Gabby Solis. I have been following the Desperate Housewives since it started eight years ago. During this time, I have lived in 3 different continents, gotten married, and learned how to cook. So for me it almost feels like the end of an era when the show comes to an end next month.  

 To mark the end of Desperate Housewives, I have decided to check out  Miss Longoria &apos;s cookbook, Eva&apos;s Kitchen: Cooking with Love for Family and Friends . I have to say this is not just another celebrity cookbook, it offers a surprisingly well-rounded and tempting selection of recipes taken straight from her own life. It is a beautiful book filled with a great selection of Mexican dishes . It had some great recipes with great stories about where they came from and how they originated. 
 This was my very first time cooking Mexican food, so I was worried I might mess something up. Luckily Eva&apos;s instructions are clear and easy to follow, and I was totally blown away by how tasty and aromatic the finishing dishes were. All I can say is Que deliciousas! 

 

   

 Eva&apos;s Mexican Rice   ( Recipe via ABCnews ) 
   
 Carmen says : This classic Tex-Mex stew is rich and delicious and totally exceeded my expectations. Our house was filled with the delicious cumin aroma. I had never cooked rice without boiling it first. I am totally impressed with this traditional Mexican way of rice cooking, 
 Eva Longoria&apos;s Guacamole Recipe  ( Recipe via Marthasteward.com )   
 
 Carmen says : This recipe is irresistible, it&apos;s very easy to make and it&apos;s fresh and light (as light as avocado can be anyway!), so much better than the ones from the stores. The combination of chilli, coriander and lime juice is delicious. Prefect party snacks! 
 Husband Says : &quot;This is Chris (holds up egg.) This is Chris on good Mexican food (cracks egg into frying pan.) Good Mexican food is like a drug. I&apos;m totally addicted. When I first moved to Asia the thing I missed most food wise was Mexican. Fast forward a few years and discover my delight at Carmen&apos;s desire to want to try cooking Mexican food. Even though these recipes aren&apos;t originally Carmen&apos;s, they are really quite good. Nicely done Miss Eva Longoria! And nicely done Mrs Anderson! Maybe I can bribe her to cook up some enchiladas next.&quot; 
 
 Baked Mac and Cheese with Bacon Recipe: Rich Creamy and Classic!

Monday, April 9, 2012 
 
 I am a big fan of those blue box stovetop mac and cheese meals. When I was growing up my mother would buy them in cases just for me. She never made it herself because I was the only one in our family who loved cheese. I remember the first time I tried homemade BAKED Mac and Cheese at a friend&apos;s house. I decided that was the best thing ever it was. 

 I still love those ready made stovetop Mac and Cheese, but now when I made it at home, I bake it!

 In this recipe, I use a mixture of Monterrey Jack cheese, mozzarella and the sharp cheddar cheese to make the sauce. The Monterrey Jack really gives it a kick. I also added some smoked bacon to make it more colorful.

Mac and cheese is also an excellent way to use up left overs, you can added bacon, pork chops, mushroom, ham, chicken, anything you can think of.  
 Estimated Cost: $15

 Husband Says: &quot;When I read this recipe, I want to have it. Maybe tomorrow I&apos;ll get lucky (dirty minds people!) and get some Carmen baked mac and cheese. Please. Please. Please give me that Carmen mac and cheese. That sounds like a jingle. Maybe I should go into advertising. Yes! I&apos;ll start by marketing my wife&apos;s mac and cheese recipe and share it the world over. It will be the first step in our plan to conquer the world. Woo them with mac and cheese, then install the Anderson Dictatorship. We will be kind rulers, I promise.&quot;

 Pan Fried Un-Skinned Salmon Fillets: Low Stress Healthy Fish Dish 

Comments (8) |
 
Wednesday, March 28, 2012 
 
 
 It is hard to go wrong with salmon and it is a favorite fish dish for many. Salmon is one of those super foods that is delicious and good for you, meaty, juicy, high in Omega-3 and protein and yet low in calories and saturated fat. 
This lovely pink fish can be cooked in many different ways. My favorite way to cook salmon is to pan-fry it. Pan-Fried Salmon is simple and fast, with beautifully crusted skin that seals in the fish&apos;s flavor.
 This dish is healthy, tasty and is a perfect meal for those with busy lifestyles who still want to enjoy great food but don&apos;t want to spend hours of preparation and cooking! 
 Serves: 2 
 Cook Time: 10 minutes 
 Estimated Cost: $10 
 Ingredients: 

 2 Salmon filets with skin intact Dash of sea salt Olive oil 
 Preparations 

 Rub the salmon with olive oil to coat and sprinkle with crushed sea salt over the oiled skin. Cook salmon in a pan on high heat skin side down, for 3-4 minutes until skin is crisp. Do not turn the fish over until the skin is golden and crisp. When the skin is crispy turn over carefully with a spatula. Cook for another 3-4 minutes. Serve immediately with side dish of choice. 
 Husband Says : &quot;Can&apos;t go wrong with salmon really. There&apos;s a reason why its so popular. I hope they never go extinct. That would make husband sad. Husband no like being sad. Husband like salmon. If I were a bear, I would fish for salmon all day long. Wait, wife is looking at me. What was that? Oh. That is what they do all day long. Right then. OK, so maybe not a bear. I would be a dolphin, but then I might end up in a tuna net and eating myself in a tuna fish sandwich. Right. Back to the point. Salmon is good. The wife&apos;s salmon is perfectly cooked for dolphins, bears or humans. It doesn&apos;t matter your species, its good. Fin.&quot; 
 
 Hello Kitty Cake Pops: Cute Kittahs On Sticks

 Hello Kitty! If you haven&apos;t heard of Cake Pops yet I&apos;d be quite surprised. It has been one of the hottest things in the baking world since cupcakes suddenly became all the rage. Thanks to Ms Angie Dudley of the blog Bakerella , these cute little desserts on a stick are now everywhere. You can get them in most cake shops, and even at your nearest starbucks.
 
 I have been wanting to make Hello Kitty cake pops for awhile, ever since I saw them on Bakerella and after seeing the Hello Kitty Terminal Gate at Taipei airport when I visited with my hubby last year. Most cake pop recipes call for baking a cake from a mix and crushing it into crumbs,   so when I noticed I had half of my Lemon olive oil proud cake left over, I knew it was a great opportunity to try out this adorable recipe. 
 Ingredients: 
 Cake (any type) Frosting (as binding agent, you can also use nutella or cream cheese) White Chocolate Melt (as coat and glue)
 Lollipop Sticks. White chocolate drops (for the ears) Black icing tube (for eyes) Yellow and Red confectioners confetti (for nose and bow) 
 Preparation: 
   
1.Crumble the cake and mix in a 1-2 teaspoon of frosting.

2. Put the mixture in the fridge for at least 1 hour to make them harder.


3. Take small chunks of the dough and roll them into balls.

4. Dip lollipop sticks in chocolate melt and stick one into the end of each ball. (chocolate drops) on with melted chocolate. Wait for the chocolate on the stick to harden., you can speed this up by putting them in the fridge .


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.Once the melted chocolate &quot;glue&quot; for the ears and stick is hardened and everything is secured, dip the entire ball into the melted white chocolate until it is totally covered. Wait for it to harden.


 
 
5.To decorate, draw eyes with black icing from a tube. Use a yellow confetti as a nose.

 
6. Use 2 pieces of red confetti as bow. All done! Daw! So cute!
 
 
 Husband Says : &quot;What can I say? I came home from work to see multiple Hello Kitty heads on sticks, which begged the question, &apos;Is this what my wife gets up to during the day?&apos; 0_o. I approve. I dawed out loud. Dawww! Cute Kittahs! I smiled at work when she showed me the pictures. How could I not? Then, I got to bite the heads off. :) Chomp. Chomp. Good stuff. And it was good too. Lemon headed little kitty heads. If only nature could produce such tasty treats. Luckily, I don&apos;t need nature, as I have my awesome wife.&quot; 
 
 Food Swap Adventure! Brooklyn Food Swap By BKSwappers 

Comments (5) |
 
Tuesday, March 20, 2012 
 
 
 In February, I blogged about how much fun we had at Queens Swap . To say that i got really into it is an under-statement. I enjoyed the experience so much that me and my friend (and the husbands) traveled all the way to Brooklyn this weekend to attend another swap, this time it was oragnized by the BKSwappers .

 After turning up with too much food and not knowing what to expect, at the first swap in Queens, I was much more prepared this time around. I started baking my Japanese rice crackers the day before. I packed them up in pretty cookie gift bags I picked up from Michael&apos;s Crafts . By the way I love Michael&apos;s Crafts, they have a huge selections of food packaging goodies at pretty good prices. If there isn&apos;t a Michael&apos;s near you, then your local craft shop could have what you&apos;re looking for.

How Swaps work: Everyone displays their homemade or home-grown goodies with swapping cards, if you are interested in an item , you write down your name and item of yours you want to swap with the goodie.


All the goods at the BKSwappers event were amazing, and I brought home a bag full of great stuff: Irish soda bread, banana bread dough, smoked papika walnuts, vanilla kimbucha, some granola bars, a pot of Brazilian brigadeiro and a bar of homemade soap!
 
I really enjoyed both the Queens Swap and the BKSwappers event. The energy, the passion and the spirit of community has totally inspired me and my friend. After the swap on Sunday, we got talking with one of the host of BKSwappers,Jane. She was really friendly and very encouraging. She even gave us some of the swapping sheets, and suggested to us to start our own food swap!!!!

And that is exactly what we&apos;re going to do because we don&apos;t want to wait another two months! Me and my friend have decided to plan our own swap! I can&apos;t wait to spread the fun and joy to more local like-minded foodies!
 
 Tempura Shrimp Recipe: Simple, Easy, Fast And Authentic 

Comments (9) |
 
Saturday, March 17, 2012 
 
 
 Tempura is considered to be one of the most well-loved and most popular of all Japanese dishes. In Japan, tempura is traditionally deep fried vegetables or seafood. However, not only battered, fried shrimp qualifies as tempura ! Tempura does not use bread crumbs , only the lightly battered food is tempura.  

 You can make tempura with almost any ingredient, I love all of them, but my favorite is definitely Tempura Shrimp . Who doesn&apos;t love crunchy deep fried Shrimps? 
 



 It&apos;s actually pretty easy to make tempura at home. All ingredients can be found easily at your local supermarket. Have fun making them! Don&apos;t forget to dip them in soy sauce and accompany them with a glass of warm sake! 

 Serves: 2 -3  

 Estimated Cost: $20 

 Cook Time: 30 minutes  

 Ingredients: 

 12 Large shrimp (if frozen need to thaw, the bigger the shrimp the better!) Flour to dust Oil for deep frying For Tempura Batter 1 cup of all purpose flour 1 tablespoon of baking soda ¼teaspoon. salt 2 egg white 1 cup ice water 

 Preparation: 
 
 Remove heads and shells from shrimp without removing the tails. Lightly press the back of shrimp to straighten. Dry shrimp on paper towels.  Beat an egg white in a bowl. Add in ice water. Add sifted flour, mix lightly. Heat the oil in the pan, and lightly coat the shrimp in flour. Then, pick the shrimp up by the tail and dip it into the tempura batter. Deep-fry the shrimp in hot oil until crisp.  
 Husband Says : &quot;Noms were had. Traditional dish. Nothing fancy, but it doesn&apos;t need to be. This is something even us dudes could learn how to do from our wives. Pretty sure I can handle it. I flip a mean pancake and can open a can of soup with the best of them.&quot;


 
 
 Lemon Olive Oil Pound Cake: Better Without Butter? 

Comments (13) |
 
Sunday, March 11, 2012 
 
 . Although I&apos;m not a big dessert person, I do love citrus cake and l emons are perhaps my favorite baking fruit of all time. If you love lemon cake, I don&apos;t think you can find a more lemony lemon cake than this one. This cake has a wonderful mouthwatering flavor that comes from adding both lemon zest (skin) and juice to the batter. Lemon zest also adds color and a little extra kick of citrus.  

 By using olive oil instead of butter, the cake is light yet moist and without the crumbly heaviness you get with butter. Don&apos;t get me wrong, its not like butter is not good! I just prefer it this way. We&apos;ll see what my husband says...he&apos;s a bit of a cake purest (aka fanatic). 
 
 
Grab a hot cup of tea, coffee or milk and enjoy a slice of this rich lemon cake.

 Cook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes 
 Estimated Cost: Around $8 (for perishables, assumes you have the basics!) 
 Ingredients 

 For the pound cake  

 2½ cups all purpose flour 1½ cups sugar  3 large eggs   3 teaspoons baking powder  1 cup lemon juice 1 cup olive oil 3 teaspoons water  1 1/2 tablespoon of Lemon Zest 
 For the Icing 

 Homemade or ready made icing (brand of choice)  1 teaspoon of lemon zest 
   Preparation 

 Preheat oven to 350 F. Generously grease and flour a flute pan.  In a electric mixer, mix all the ingredients on low until blended. Then beat for 1 minutes on high speed.  Pour batter into pan. Bake until cake tester comes out clean ( 50-60 minutes).  Spread icing over the cake once the cake has cooled. Sprinkle Lemon zest on the top. 
 Husband Says : &quot;Carmen was scared for me to try this one. She knows I&apos;m crazy about cake and desserts. Like, I have an amazing sweet tooth. Its huge. It likes cake. The cake to me, is not a lie. This cake, this wonderful cake, is most definitely not a lie. I did not know it was made with no butter until I read this recipe. Bamboozled! It was moist with just the right amount of lemon flavor and not too crumbly. The icing was out of a can, but really, does icing ALWAYS have to be homemade? Its mixing sugar with water or juice. I mean c&apos;mon. Even I could mix water and sugar. Moral of the story: Lemon cake made with olive oil instead of butter is good, and passed the sweet tooth test.&quot;


 
 
 Japanese Rice Crackers (Senbei ): A Crunchy, Crispy And Easy Asian Snack 

Comments (8) |
 
Saturday, March 10, 2012 
 
 
Japanese rice crackers, or Senbei, are usually baked or grilled, traditionally over charcoal. They come in different sizes, shapes and flavors, mostly savory but sometimes sweet. they may also be flavored with salt, soy souce and seaweed.

Senbei are often eaten with green tea as a casual snack and offered to visiting house guests as refreshment. They are also a popular street food, there is even a street in Asakusa devoted to making and selling Senbei. 

 I have been wanting to make Senbei for awhile, and when my wonderful mother-in-law sent us a food processor as a gift, I knew I had to put it to good use and make this lovely treat. 

 Cook time: 30 minutes Serves: 2 dozens Estimates Cost: $10 Ingredients 
 3/4 cup sweet rice flour 1/3 cup cooked sushi rice 3/4 teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoons oil 4 tablespoons water 3 tablespoon furikake (Japanese rice seasoning, you can buy this in any Asian market) 
 Preparation 
 
 Preheat oven to 400F.  In a food processor, combine the rice flour, white rice, salt, and oil. Pulse-blend until finely ground.  Add in water to the ground mix. Transfer to a bowl, mix in the furikake, Press balls of the dough between cling-film into thin disks (The thinner the discs the crispier they will be).  Bake on greased baking sheets for 6 minutes then flip the crackers with a spatula and continue to cook until they are dry and beginning to brown, 5-6 more minutes. Remove from oven. Allow crackers to cool and crisp up before serving. 
 Husband Says : &quot;I took these over too the HuffPo news room and distributed to various malnourished and snack fiending editors. They all loved em. I know they weren&apos;t kissing my ass either because none of them report to me. Seriously, you can just sit back and chomp on these things all day. This was Carmen&apos;s second batch, and she nailed it. The first time around they weren&apos;t so crispy, but she rallied and produced these treats. A great between meal snack for anybody.&quot;
