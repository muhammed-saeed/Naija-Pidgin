Been going to Miguel&apos;s since Corona was a one taco town.  30 years plus or minus a few.

Since then, the kids have grown, Miguel&apos;s is now a chain, and Corona has grown so much it has much more than hamburgers, tacos and bars.  See? Life changes if you have the patience to wait.

But I always come back to Miguel&apos;s.  My personal favorite, the shredded beef with beans and cheese burrito.  Lots of moist savory meat. You can slop as many condiments and tons of their hot sauce as you like, when you eat inside.  You can also go through drive through, but they are a bit more conservative about how much hot sauce you can have.

I don&apos;t know why, but the humble food from Miguel&apos;s Jr seems to taste much better than their sit down restaurant, Miguel&apos;s, on the West side of town.  Go figure.

I love this place!
This place is perfect. I have been eating at this small family owner chain for 25 years!
The hot sauce and the food go hand and hand....
The saddest day in my life is when I moved out of California 5 years ago. To this day I still have family ship me a box of burritos and hot sauce to me in Atlanta several times a year.

The first place I go after getting off a plane when I visit home!

Pros: Best burritos and hot sauce in the world (suggest shredded beef and rice with a huge cup of hot sauce
Cons: Need to open a location up in the South so all these Hillbilly&apos;s learn what real Mexican food is (No Damn it! Catsup is not salsa!).

First off- the food gets 5 stars.  Now that I&apos;ve gotten that out of the way, the service gets 0 stars.  When I lived in Corona, Miguel&apos;s Jr was a place that would never disappoint.  No matter what location, the service was always good and the food was always awesome.  I was in Norco last weekend, so I stopped in for some grub.  What a bummer.  As soon as I walked in the door, there was trash on the floor next to the trash bin.  Someone probably just left it there, no biggie.
Walk up to the counter, and the cashier is talking with one of the cooks in Spanish.  He looks at me and says to her &quot;you gonna help the guero?&quot;.  Damn, glad I paid attention in Spanish class.  Didn&apos;t know how to take it, so I just walked out.  Still bummed about the whole situation.

Miguel&apos;s Jr never fails me.

I suppose I am a creature of habit because I always get their shredded beef burrito. Nicely seasoned shredded beef, wrapped in a flour tortilla and topped off with cheese and enchilada sauce.  You can get it original (with rice and beans) or garbage (all the fixings).

There is no mistake, this place is a fast food place and it&apos;s not your &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican food, but it doesn&apos;t have that feel.  Food is quality, portions are large and service is very good.

Decent salsa bar to dress up your food to your liking.  Couple different salsas, mixture of cilantro / onions, jalapenos to choose from.

Miguel&apos;s always hits the spot for me and I will continue to go here when I&apos;m in the area.

Very bland food, so very inoffensive.  Sometimes spice isn&apos;t everything, and I think that&apos;s Miguel&apos;s mantra.  Excellent quality ingredients too.

Dear Miguel Jr,

I kind of sorta love you. Why? Well it simple, I can get a delicious bean cheese and rice burrito for dirt cheap that tastes a heck of alot better than taco bell. You are quick and efficient. I love you because you are a So Cal native much like myself, you are not so &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican but you hit my little white girl stomachs spot for some Mexican to-go. I love your carne asada quesadilla&apos;s too. You are always clean and friendly when I drive through or come in. I like you...lets stay friends forever!

miguels jr always reminds me of high school! centennial high in corona was lucky enough to serve bean and cheese or bean and rice burritos during lunch while i was in high school. since then, i&apos;ve heard that is no longer the case.

i hate beans but their bean and cheese burrito, i actually like! their garbage burrito with carne asada is yums! i usually get that wet style (topped with enchilada sauce and cheese).

even if i&apos;m getting a to-go order, i like to go inside instead of drive-thru cuz i like to get my own sides/sauces. i love self serve salsa bars! they have everything from jalapenos and chopped onions, to hot sauces and cilantro.

the only reason for my 4 stars is i think they are a bit over priced.

Anyone who has spent any time in the IE should know all about Miguel&apos;s Jr.
The place with the LONG and SLOW drive thru at pretty much any time of day!
So worth it tho!
It&apos;s not the best Mexican food in the world or even authentic, but something about it is good!!
Love the Bean Rice&amp;Cheese burrito with EXTRA cheese!!
Shredded beef taco and nachos are good too.

Miguel&apos;s Jr.&apos;s are sprinkled through out the IE. Corona has the most. I always try to stop when driving thru the IE at lunch time!

I laugh when people get angry at the fact that they didn&apos;t eat &quot;authentic Mexican food&quot; at Miguel Jr&apos;s.  Are you really expecting to find authentic Mex at a drive through place?? Right. All in all this place is the best fast food Mexican I have ever had (heck, even better than most real &quot;Mexican&quot; places) Please do not compare it to Taco Bell or Del Taco (bleh) because there is no comparison. And I consider it better than Alberto&apos;s down the street.  Alberto&apos;s is always a hit or miss depending on which one you go to.  And the greasiness of the food there is just not appealing. I prefer to have my fat disguised, thank you very much.

I have had the garbage burrito which was delicious, but way too much for one person to consume alone. The chicken and steak tacos. (The steak is bomb! And cooked exceptionally well for a fast food place) And the enchiladas.  I will agree that the salsas are not spicy enough for my palate, but the green salsa&apos;s flavor is to die for.  I am a bean and rice fanatic, and the beans and rice from here are delicious. The tortillas are soft and not overpowering or heavy.  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, go to your friends moms house. If you are looking for bomb Mexican fast food, come to Miguel Jr&apos;s.  You won&apos;t be disappointed.

Its hard to give this place two stars with its great customer service and well maintained restaurant. Problem number 1: restaurant claims the food is home-style Mexican and its not even close to it. Problem number 2: lacks flavor. Problem number 3: the hot sauce is not hot by any sense.

I tried the garbage burrito and it lacked flavor on the rice, beans, meat and everything else it came with. My GF tried the taquitos with a guacamole that appears to come out of a pre-prepared bag.

I walked in here with high hopes because I wanted to try something different and at the end I should have stuck to the Chipotle across the street that I was originally looking for. All in all its not horrible if you like food without flavor or Mexican food without a real hot sauce. I can get better Mexican food from Taco Bell with spicier hot sauce.

The Corona natives seem to love this place... It&apos;s a Mexican joint that seems to take everyone back to their high school days when they needed easy food on the cheap.

I&apos;m all for that... And I agree, the prices are really reasonable here.  Among the spectrum of fast food, hole in the wall type Mexican places, I&apos;m not sure that Miguel&apos;s stacks up.

But then again, what do I know?  I&apos;m just some Asian dude that likes King Taco a lot.

Ok when I first moved to Norco everyone...I mean everyone was crazy for this place.  So I went there and had the garbage burro.  It was ok
It was just ok. Alberto&apos;s is way better. This place is soooo lucky it got 2 stars.

Every time I go to the IE, I have to make a trip to Miguel&apos;s. I love this place! I get the bean tacos. I know it sounds boring but it&apos;s soooo good! I have ordered the veggie wet burrito before which is also good but my first love are the tacos.

restaurant was clean, staff was friendly and our food came out pretty quick although it was busy on a saturday night.

this place is different from your typical Alerto&apos;s or Alberto&apos;s. They dont have the usual carne asada fries, and everyday items you find at fast food mexican joints. I&apos;d say that the menu here is kinda limited.

would definitely come back here next time i want mexican food and in Norco.

*Carne Asada Burrito

4 stars for typical restaurant&apos;s quality beef in carne asada burrito in fast food joint!

You don&apos;t have to sit at the restaurant to get the type of meat you get when you order carne asada. In this fast food joint you can just come pick up and go while enjoy restaurant quality stuff. Gotto love this joint when your friends don&apos;t want to go eat at restaurant but you gotto have that stuff!

What can I say about Miguel&apos;s Jr.  This place has been a staple of Corona and Norco fast food dining since the 1970s.  This is a completely biased review because I grew up on this food and I love it!

Possibly the world&apos;s best red sauce. It&apos;s not really authentic Mexican, but delicious none the less. Crowded during lunch time for a reason. I recommend the garbage burrito. Much more delicious than it sounds. Can&apos;t beat it for the price.

Wet bean and cheese burrito was okay. I got a quesadilla, well I ordered a quesadilla and got a tortilla folded in half with no cheese. I could actually see through the tortilla. Would not last or be as busy in LA or a Mexican market. Works for the IE though.

Hey.. Foodies can enjoy fast food too right?

For those of you who are not in the IE, you must make the trek to Miguel&apos;s Jr.  I grew up in Corona but now live in OC and I find myself driving 35 miles inland just to get a burrito.

For you Miguel&apos;s n00bs, you can get the classic bean, rice, and cheese but my standard order is the shredded beef, rice, and cheese burrito.  Abso-freakin-lutely awesome.

Don&apos;t skimp on the hot sauce either as the hot sauce is what makes the best burrito even better.  The hot sauce is so good that I will buy a pint just to take home.

Prices are cheap and food is great.  Another plus is that they have crushed ice for their sodas!

There Hot sauce is to die for! I love getting a Bean and Cheese burrito and a side of rice and I like to soak it with there hot sauce. There food is delicious! I find myself driving 40miles just to come here and get a burrito. I don&apos;t live in Norco/Corona but I use to hang out in this area ALOT so after I stop coming to this city, I would still make a fast food run to Norco just to get a bean and cheese burrito with HOT sauce. I love this place! This would be my favorite mexican fast food! I&apos;m drooling right now thinking about this place.

Not as good as it used to be; result of bad economy?

Bean and Cheese- is really good
Garb. Bur.- is ok
Nachos- good (got it with beef-their beef is good!)

BUT- this place is really clean, front and back of house (I used to work here) and that is something that deserves a star!

I have been eating at Miguel&apos;s since the 1980&apos;s. Nothing compares to Miguel&apos;s! I have traveled and been to 100&apos;s of mexican food places. It is family owned. I wish they had these in LA!!!!!
