 Japanese restaurants in Tokyo | Nakau 

Japanese company Nakau operates chain Japanese restaurants which are specializing in gyudon (bowl of rice topped with beef), oyako donburi (bowl of rice topped with chicken and eggs) and Japanese noodles.
These Japanese chain restaurants are not expensive and serve tasty food.
Japanese like to dine in Nakau, so I wanted to check this Japanese restaurant too.
There are a lot of Nakau restaurants around Japan, only in Tokyo there are 82.
I went to one of them.

Japanese restaurant in Tokyo | Nakau- interior and atmosphere

Interior of Nakau looks very pleasant.
It is modern and clean. Not too colourful but this is even better. Glass, aluminium, dark grey and green. I like this combination.

Kitchen area is separated from customer area, but customers sitting behind U shaped counter can see what is going on in the kitchen.

Except counter there are also 4 tables, for 4 people each from one side of customer area.
Nakau interior is well designed, has lots of light and space.
I went there in morning so restaurant was actually empty.

But I liked modern look and peaceful atmosphere of Nakau.

Japanese restaurant in Tokyo| Nakau- food and service

First thing we received in Nakau when we were waiting for our food was cup of green tea.

And it was for free. I like this a lot.
I wanted to try small portion of Hiyashi Tan Tan Udon . It is good alternative for those who are not so hungry.
In contrast, my friend wanted some solid breakfast, but because we came to restaurant too late, there was no chance for morning set anymore.
Morning set is a good bargain as it costs just 290 yen for portion of rice, raw egg, soup and side salad. Nice set and good price for sure. Morning set is served till 11 am.

But because it was too late, my hungry friend decided to order portion of Nami Gyudon and Tonjiru soup.
We were waiting. In front of us there were spices and soy sauce in small containers and in bigger container, free beni shoga- pink coloured pickled ginger.

Finally we got our food.
Hiyashi Tan Tan Udon was udon with minced beef meat and spicy chilli sauce and with chopped spring onions of the top.

It was delicious and spicy little dish, which I ate with extra portion of beni shoga.
Later I regretted I did not ordered normal portion of Tan Tan Udon.

Nami Gyudon contained thin pieces of pork meat fried with onion and placed on bed of cooked rice. My friend’s choice.

Tonjiru soup was white miso based soup with spring onions, mushrooms, white Japanese radish, carrots, soto imo and gobo. Rich vegetable soup, very healthy stuff.

I tried these two. Both dishes were tasty and full of flavour even if simple.
I do like such kind of food.

Japanese chain restaurant Nakau- comments

Nakau is my kind of fast food restaurant.
It is served fast, it is tasty and healthy food. Easy to order and easy to pay.
I like a lot Nakau clean environment and modern look.
It makes me feel confident that all food is prepared with care, because if staff care for cleanness, definitely must care for food quality as well.
Nakau is good alternative for McDonalds and surely healthier.
I do recommend this chain restaurant.
