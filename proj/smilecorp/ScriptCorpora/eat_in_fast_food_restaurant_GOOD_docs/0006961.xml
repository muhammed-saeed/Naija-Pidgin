Building Bridges
 
    
 

 
 
 
 In this lesson, students transition from arithmetical to algebraic thinking by exploring problems that are not limited to single-solution responses. Values organized into tables and graphs are used to move toward symbolic representations. Problem situations involving linear, quadratic, and exponential models are employed. This lesson is based upon the article&quot;Building Bridges to Algebraic Thinking&quot;by Roger Day, which appeared in the February 1997 edition of Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School . 
 
 
Learning Objectives
 

   Students will:
 represent, analyze, and generalize a variety of patterns with tables, graphs, words, and, when possible, symbolic rules use symbolic algebra to represent situations and to solve problems model and solve contextualized problems using various representations, such as graphs, tables, and equations

 Introductory Comments 
This lesson assists teachers in building a bridge between their current instructional goals and new goals that emphasize an earlier introduction to algebraic thinking. In the activities which follow, we illustrate an approach to algebraic thinking that is based on an extension of problem-solving tasks typically investigated by elementary and 
middle school students.
 
 Problem Tasks 
Pose the following question to students. They may work individually or in groups, depending on their needs.

 
 
Every Saturday you play basketball in the local 

community youth club. At the end of the season after a club tournament, the 

players in the club meet at a fast-food restaurant for a party. If hamburgers 

cost 59¢, what is the total cost for 15 players to have a hamburger 

each? 
 The Hamburger 
Problem
 
 
 
Note that the task is completed once the single solution 

has been determined. The situation does not necessarily motivate further exploration 
or mathematical thinking.
When a different question is posed, however, problems like the one above can be used as a bridge to further mathematical thinking.
 
Read the following problem to your students. Once again, students may work individually or in groups, according to their needs.
  
 
Every Saturday you play basketball in the local 
community youth club. At the end of the season after a club tournament, the 
players in the club meet at a fast-food restaurant for a party. If hamburgers 
cost 59¢, find a way to determine the total cost of hamburgers when various 
numbers of players in the club each have a hamburger. 
 A variation of the Hamburger Problem 
 
 
As you discuss this new problem with your students, ask them the following questions:
 How is this question similar to the original Hamburger Problem? How is this question different from the original Hamburger Problem? How did you solve the new problem differently?

The posing of a new question does not guarantee a change in students&apos; 

thinking. Students may adopt a thinking process that merely generates the 

hamburger costs for specific numbers of players, treating each number of 

players or hamburgers as a separate and unrelated situation. Under this 

scenario, despite the change in task, students&apos; thinking may not have 

progressed beyond 
what was expected for the original task. However, by posing the revised Hamburger Problem, teachers give students an opportunity to do more than simply generate specific solutions.
Under this second scenario, students may make a table of values, construct some 
portion of a graph, or invoke the use of variables. More important, they may 
identify, describe, and extend a pattern. In other words, they are engaged in what we understand as algebraic thinking.
Students may use algebraic symbols to respond to this new problem. For example, a student might respond with C  = $0.59 ×  p . In this equation, C  represents the total cost, and p  represents the number of players.
 
 Using a Problem Task as a Bridge to Algebraic Thinking 
To illustrate the use of a problem situation for middle school students that 

serves as a bridge to algebraic thinking, consider the problem described below.
 
  
 
Each class in your middle school is making valentine 

cards to sell at affordable prices to elementary school students in your 

district. The cards are boxed in groups of 12 before they are routed to the 

elementary schools. Find a way to determine how many cards have been made when 

various numbers of boxes have been routed to the elementary 

schools. 
 The Valentine-Cards Problem 
 
 
As students will undoubtedly use different strategies to solve this problem, listed below are different probes you, the teacher, can use to help guide students during the problem solving process.
 
For students finding it difficult to 

begin the problem, the teacher might pose this series of questions:

 Can you find how many cards were made if 25 boxes were routed to the 

elementary schools? If 40 boxes were routed? What did you do in each case? Write an explanation to describe what you 

did. 

 
For students who have already begun to list the number of cards made for 

specific numbers of boxes, the teacher might pose these questions:

 Can you organize your information into a table or graph? How would you describe your table or graph? 

 
For students who have already begun to organize a table or construct a 

graph, the teacher might use some of the following probes:

 What if the district routed more boxes than those shown in your table or 

graph? Can you see a pattern that goes beyond your table or graph? Write a 

description of your pattern. 

 
For students who have already begun to describe the pattern in words, 

the teacher might use some of the following probes:

 What is the key aspect of the pattern you have described? Can you express the pattern you see using b to stand for the number 

of boxes and C for the total number of cards made for the elementary 
schools? 

 
The ongoing interactions suggested by these questions enable the teacher to 

capitalize on students&apos; previous problem-solving experience and, by using a 

different focus, to extend their thinking beyond specific cases. Students are 

challenged not only to compute specific numerical values but generalize their 

thinking beyond specific values to values they have not handled, have not 

included in a table, or have not shown in a graph. In essence, the intention is 

to help students recognize and describe in their thinking process, in their 

table, or in their graph, numerical patterns that will lead to a more general 

description of the problem solution. The most viable demonstration of this 

outcome is a representation that expresses the solution process in a symbolic 

way using variables. When students are able to construct such a symbolic 

relationship, we believe that algebraic thinking has begun.
 
The approach outlined through this illustration needs to be used repeatedly 

with students if they are to recognize all the different representations and 

the connections among them, as well as realize that a representation involving 
variables is the more informative and concise description of a mathematical 

pattern. However, it is not enough for students merely to develop algebraic 

relationships; they need to see that these relationships empower them to solve 

a range of related problems and to move to a more advanced stage in algebraic 

thinking.


 Extending the Approach to Further Algebraic 
Thinking 
Once students have engaged in algebraic thinking and modeling through a 

series of problems like the valentine-cards problem, further explorations in 

algebraic thinking can be generated by using problems that are related to the 
original problem. The table below illustrates a set of related problems, 

stemming from the valentine-cards context, that enable students&apos; 

algebraic thinking to be 
extended to new algebraic representations; substitution, linear equations and 

inequalities, and equivalence of algebraic expressions. As did the original 

problem, the related problems shown in the table should stimulate various 

solution strategies.


 Related Problems, Algebraic Representations, and 
Potential Solution Strategies
(Stemming from the Valentine-Card Problem and the Algebraic Representation C  = 12 b ) 
 RELATED PROBLEMS ALGEBRAIC REPRESENTATIONS SOLUTION STRATEGIES (1) How many cards were made if 600 boxes were routed to elementary 

schools?   C = 
12(600) 
Compute; return to the original problem
 
Read value; use a graphic representation or a table of values
 
Solve; use formal algebraic thinking
 (2) By the end of the first week in February, 1440 cards had been 

sent to the elementary schools. How many boxes had been sent? 1440 = 12 b (3) If more than 9600 cards have been made by the district&apos;s 

middle schools, how many boxes will be routed to the elementary schools?  12 b  &gt; 9600 (4) In one shipment of b boxes of cards, 
water damage destroys two cards in each box. How many cards in the shipment are 

still usable? Solve this problem in two different ways. C  = 12 b -2 b , C  = 10 b , 
    
or

12 b  - 2 b  = 10 b 
 
 
For example, students might solve problem 2 by returning 

to the original valentine-cards problem to compute how many 12s are needed to 

reach 1440 using trial and error or division. However, the 

availability of the algebraic representation C  = 12 b , where C represents total number of cards made and b represents the 
number of boxes of cards, and the fact that 1440 is a specific value for the 

variable C , provide the momentum for enabling students to generate the 

algebraic equation 1440 = 12 b . Once this equation is represented, 

students can use a graph or a table or, eventually, more formal strategies to 

solve the problem.
Students may also use a graphing calculator, 

or similar technology tools, to generate a graph or table in solving problems 

like 
problem 2. With the availability of such 

technology as the graphing calculator, graphical solutions have taken on a new 

meaning as a key process in algebraic thinking at all levels. This new emphasis 

on graphical methods and technology notwithstanding, teachers may want to use 

this opportunity to guide students toward more formal solution strategies, such 

as the use of inverse operations, for solving such equations as 1440 = 12 b .

 Where Do You Go from Here? 
Thus far, this lesson has focused on an approach to algebraic thinking, involving 

linear models, that could easily begin as early as grade 5. This same approach 

can also be used in the later middle grades to develop algebraic thinking that 
incorporates nonlinear models arising from quadratic, exponential, or even 

rational models. The essence of the approach is to identify problems that 

embody such nonlinear models.
Two such problems, representing quadratic and exponential relationships, are 

presented in the Building Bridges activity sheet to illustrate the kind of starting points we 

envisage for exploring algebraic thinking in nonlinear contexts.

 Building Bridges Activity Sheet 

Once such 

modeling relationships as N  =  G(G -1)/2 and F  = 2 n have been developed, the relationships can be used to 

extend algebraic thinking to representations involving equations, inequalities, 

and equivalent expressions. As with linear relationships, tables and graphs 

generated with a graphing calculator or similar technology can be used to 

solve problems and investigate the properties of quadratic and exponential 
relationships.

 Solutions to the Activity Sheet 
 This is a quadratic relationship, N  =  G(G -1)/2, 

where G represents the number of girls registered and N is the 

number of 
games to be played.) The number of friends invited on the n th day is an 

exponential relationship, F  = 2 n , where n represents the day number and F is the number of friends. The total 

money raised after n days is also an exponential relationship, T  = (2 n + 1 - 2)(0.25), where n represents the day number 
and T is the total money raised.)
