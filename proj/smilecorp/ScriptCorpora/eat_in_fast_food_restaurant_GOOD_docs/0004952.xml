Surprising Health Finding About Fast Food Meals

by Ashley Staker on April 1, 2010 
 
What’s worse for you—eating at a sit-down restaurant or a fast food joint? The answer is not as obvious as you might think: Restaurant dining may actually do more damage to your waistline and wallet, at least by some measures.

At Purdue University in Indiana, James K. Binkley , PhD, a professor in the department of agricultural economics, compared calorie and gram intake from fast food, restaurant-prepared and home-cooked meals. Using data from the US Department of Agriculture Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, he found that:
 
Which is worse?
 
-Whether you grab a quick burger at a fast food joint or sit down to a meal in a restaurant, you are apt to get larger servings and more calories per serving than in home-cooked meals.

-Portions in fast food meals, while typically larger, tend to contain fewer calories per meal than restaurant-prepared meals. However, Dr. Binkley points out that if this is offset by feeling less full afterward, you might be prone to snack later on. He believes that restaurant diners are more likely to feel satisfied after meals and consequently eat less afterward.

These results were published in the Winter 2008 issue of the Review of Agricultural Economics.

 Mindful Eating 

According to Dr. Binkley, the real message here is to be extremely conscious of what and how much you eat whenever you go out, whether it’s at a fast-food drive-thru or an elegant restaurant. Both are likely to lead to eating bigger portion sizes and more calories than eating at home.

If you do dine out, follow these healthful strategies:

 Watch portion sizes. Super-sized menu options and typical restaurant servings both dwarf how much you are likely to eat at home. Keep in mind that a reasonable serving of chicken or steak is the size of a deck of cards, about three ounces. Order condiments on the side. You may not want to give up altogether on sour cream for your baked potato or hollandaise with your asparagus, but asking for it on the side puts you in charge of portion control. Make sensible choices. If you are going to a restaurant, no matter what kind, consider the cooking method, ingredients, sauces and condiments when ordering—grilled fish is better than smothered pork chops and a grilled chicken sandwich (hold the special sauce and cheese) usually has fewer calories than the giant burger. Chain restaurants, whether fast food or sit down, will usually provide information about calorie, fat and sodium content for all menu options. Ask for substitutes. For example, when I dine out, I often order two vegetables to accompany my protein rather than a vegetable and a starch. 

One way to please both your budget and your palette is to always bring some of it home for tomorrow’s lunch. You don’t have to finish everything you are served—even in a fine restaurant, where you might worry about hurting the chef’s feelings. Pack it up to enjoy again without regrets of overeating.
