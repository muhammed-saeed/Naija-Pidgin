 One Man’s Pursuit of Heat 

By Maxwell G. Moore The pursuit of heat is the fundamental calling of a man… especially this particular man. Perhaps I’m still a cave man at heart trying to reinvent fire, but warmth is king in my world. Considering that most of the universe around us is either mind-bogglingly frigid or nuclear meltdown hot, we’re [...]


 
 Marina–Our Latest Miss Take 


 
 Jury Duty: Working Man’s Nightmare 

I consider myself an upstanding citizen with a strong patriotic streak. I believe that in the United States our justice system is solid. It’s certainly not without flaws, but generally it works. Let’s face it…for all its warts, it’s a vast improvement over many other countries. Even so I still get a little flutter [...]

 The Naughty Nurse Fantasy–Can it really happen? 

Picture a typical middle-aged male who has been gravely injured in a bizarre pitchfork accident. He is recovering in a local hospital and trapped in a bed for several days. Our hero, let’s call him Phil, has managed to fight off the nurses who want to insert a Foley catheter into his penis. This is [...]


 
 Truly Manly Drink–Black Russian 

Introducing the Pure Liquor Mixed Drink Rule for Manly Drinkers…When you order a typical mixed drink, you’re leaving the strength of that drink entirely up to the bartender. Chances are there is a proper glass used in that establishment for the drink you’ve ordered, but the proportion of liquor to mixer (juice, soda, milk, [...]

 Dominant Traits of the 21st Century 

By Maxwell G. Moore Editor-in-Chief Man’s Take Magazine Before you get all pissed off about how this article unfairly portrays you and your generation–oh wait, I just remembered something… I don’t care if this article pisses you off. That’s what I’m here for! Let me try that again: before you get all pissed off [...]


 
 Kamikaze Shooter–Featured Manly Drink 

Like a divine wind they swept out of the sky in a thunderous rage of human-piloted destruction. Kamikaze is what the Japanese combat pilots called it when they packed their planes with fuel and/or explosives and intentionally flew them into enemy naval vessels during World War II, sacrificing their own lives to kill the allied [...]

 Speeding Tickets, Traffic Tickets, and Other Driving Adventures 

At least to some extent, certain tendencies are hard-wired into the brains of our male species. One such behavior is the“need for speed.”Of course this isn’t limited to only men, but generally more men seek out the rush of speed. I think it’s a testosterone thing. Perhaps it’s correlated to danger, or perhaps [...]

 Fantasy Threesome – Two Girls, One Man’s Dream – Menage Trois 

Two girls on one guy is the quintessential male fantasy. The “why” of this cannot readily be explained. It’s simply a fact of life that’s hard-wired into the brain of most human males. More girls, especially all at once, is better… in fantasy land at least. But, what about in reality?

 Real Men Get Tested for STDs 

Men may be pigs… Strike that. Men are seed-spreading swine who will fornicate with virtually any willing participant of the appealing sex, especially after a couple of brewskis. I don’t have a problem with that. If it wouldn’t make me a total hypocrite I probably wouldn’t condone rampant sex because it leads to the spread [...]

 Gym Time – Manly Gym Etiquette 

By Jake Walker It’s true the gym is a place of utter masculinity where the testosterone flows freely (occasionally through syringes, but that’s another story), and we all should try to allow people some freedom to express themselves physically through motion and exercise. However, there are some lines that need to be drawn when it [...]

 Eating a Healthy Breakfast 

According to Burger King®, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It’s not often your fitness coach quotes a fast food restaurant for nutrition information, but this is probably the one case where I actually agree with the King of Grease and Sodium, creepy as he may be. Our society has flipped nutrition [...]
