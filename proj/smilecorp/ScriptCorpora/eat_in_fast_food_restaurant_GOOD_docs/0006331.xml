Ways to Increase Your Cash Flow
 Gimpao Ni Ei Suuh — Ranked #1 in Sales&amp;Selling Careers FOLLOW Having a steady flow a cash will not be possible without positive attitude and principles. In this article, tips and the right attitude in holding money are discussed. 
One of the major root causes of debt is the unwillingness to change lifestyles even when circumstances in life have changed. What do I mean by this? When you and your spouse were newly-weds, your only concerns were the basics like food, rentals, electricity, and water. Right? You could still afford to dine out because you were a childless couple then. It was cheaper and more convenient than cooking. But when your first child was born, what happened? Your expenses increased. From P15,000 to P20,000 a month, your expenses substantially grew. This is because you have to spend for diapers, milk formula, baby food etc. not to mention possibly hiring a babysitter-housemaid. What are you going to do? How do you solve the problem? First, you have no other choice but to change your lifestyle.

Ways to Increase your cash flow:

 1. Change Your Lifestyle, Spend Less 

Based on personal experience, 40% or at least 30% of the budget for groceries go to milk and diaper alone. When your expenses increases yet your income is still the same, there are adjustments that need to bed one and you must be willing to change your lifestyle. 
 
For example, prior to the birth of the baby, you dine out four times a month. You must do it less frequently, decreasing it to once or twice a month. Why? Obviously, with the baby around, there are additional expenses.

Let&apos;s take another example. What if your husband lost his job and you incur expenses of P15,000 to P20,000 a month? You were used to going out weekly for lunch or dinner. If the spouse or the breadwinner lost his job, then you cannot afford to dine out anymore. Do you agree? Instead of dining out, you just eat at home. 

In other words, you must be willing to change your lifestyle. However, as I have observed, many people still remain their old lifestyles. In the process, they get into debt.

2. Always be open-minded for other opportunities

If changing your lifestyle isn&apos;t enough, it is time for you to look at opportunities for other sources of income. We have to keep an open mind so we can allow ourselves to attract opportunities for other sources of income. We also should insist ton following the opportunities no matter how trivial they may seem. Keeping an open mind seems being open to all possibilities. 

 3. Save as Much as You can 

The main goal and objective in making more money is not for us to spend more but to save. We can miss the whole point of working extra long hours and sacrificing time away from family. Although many people dream about winning the lottery, it is highly unlikely that you will ever win. It will not help make our dreams come true. But there is tried-and-true way to reach your goals. It takes discipline, time and hard work. It&apos;s a steady plant of saving and investing.

Saving means setting aside money on a regular basis, preferably from every paycheck. But to save, you must spend less than what you earn and do it for a long time. Reducing your spending, as opposed to earning more money, is the real key to gaining control of your finances. Unfortunately, many people spend everything they earn or even live beyond their means that is why they don&apos;t increase their cash flow. 

 4. Maintain Your Lifestyle 

One time, I was lining up at a very famous fast-food chain, Then beside my line, a person recognized me and then asked, &quot; Are you Mr.Jerome, the actor and businessman?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He then continued, &quot;You also eat at this type of resaturant.&quot; I know what he was trying to say. Because I can afford to eat at more expensive and sophisticated restaurants, why am I eating at a fast-food restaurant? Quietly in my mind I replied, &quot;The reason I&apos;m wealthy is because I&apos;m eating at this type of restaurant.&quot; One thing I&apos;m thankful is that my parent really taught and trained me well.

 5. Have a Long-term Perspective 

After savings, be willing to start small, always remember, &quot;It is not how much money you make but how much money you save.&quot; After savings, the next question asked by most people is where to park the money in order for it to grow. In using your resources, always think long-term. To meet long-term goals such as saving fo your children&apos;s education or for your own retirement, growth investments might be suitable choices.
