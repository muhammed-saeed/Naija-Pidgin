 For several years I have 
 been seeing the number sequence 1111. I always wondered if it was a 
 coincidence or something more. Finally, the amount of times that the 
 events occurred, made me believe that it was more than chance. So I 
 started searching the web and found I was not alone. There were 
 hundreds if not thousands of people experiencing the same thing. What is this 1111 phenomenon all about.? Some of the explanations went beyond what I was willing to 
 accept. I ultimately settled on and was willing to believe that it 
 could be a way for our Guardian Angels to let us know they were here for us.   I have included my 
 experiences below. We can consider seeing these 
 1111 events as a 1111 prompt from our Angel friends.  I also believe these experiences can help us grow 
 spiritually, because they make us stop and question what these prompts 
 could mean to us.  You can also go to my favorite 11:11 Message Board site and meet others that are experiencing the same 1111 prompts. This 11:11 message board has some great people I&apos;ve known some for 5 years now. My 
 thread at the site is Traveling with 1111

 MY 11:11 STORIES BELOW 
 
 New Post below for 1/31/2012 
 I can&apos;t believe how fast a year went. I 
almost didn&apos;t make it to my 62nd birthday. Many of you know that I almost died last year, 
so I thank God for each day. 
 Most of my time this year was 
spent trying to find an Internet opportunity that would allow me to retire early. I think I found it.

 My daughter and I stopped at McDonalds and we 
 used the drive thru. Our Drive thru shows your order 
 on a board by the window, so 
we heard the amount and saw 
 the $11.11 total price. I chuckled and turned to my daughter 
 and she was smiling as well. She knows about my 1111 interest.

 Hi everyone ,

I got a good laugh from this prompt today. Sometime in September
I had used my cellphone to take the picture and then emailed it to
myself. When I found it today I couldn&apos;t remember where I had been
when I took the picture. So I used Google search for the telephone
number you see and it gave me a link to a youtube video. It was a
pizza commerical from 1985 and it was from Toronto Canada. I guess
it must be pretty good pizza since it&apos;s still there. 
 
 

 What made this prompt interesting (You all know those are my favorites )
was the fact the driver had to go down this street because the other
main street was blocked by fire department activity. If it wasn&apos;t for that
activity I would have missed the prompt.

Hope you get a laugh from the video:

 When I got to Louisiana I was trying to decide if 
I was going to take a shuttle service or a cab.
So I was standing at the cab stand for about 10 minutes and that whole time I 
see white cabs coming and going.  

 I then walk to the shuttle area and no shuttle was there and the dispatcher said it 
would be another
15 minutes so I returned to the cab stand and the second cab in line was 
 

 Now that was cool   and I did wait a few minutes but no one came to 
get the first cab, so I did
finally go to the first cab in line. So for the 20 to 30 minutes I was there I 
did not see another blue cab or
a cab with that phone number. This would qualify for the timing prompt since I 
did not take a cab
right away and I decided not to wait for the shuttle and came back to the cab 
stand and was able
to experience my favorite prompt.

Thought I was done didn&apos;t you! 

 I ended up at the Horseshoe casino hotel and not 
till I got home 

 and started filling out my 
expense report did I see
at the bottom of the bill the zip code for the hotel ... 

 

 Okay that&apos;s it for now. Yes I usually see many 
more 1111 prompts but I keep the special ones for here.
Hope everyone had a great weekend.

   I&apos;m back 

 

 I had spent the night at the Hyatt Regency 
 right at the Pittsburgh airport.
You just take a covered walkway right to the hotel. So I obviously did not
know or need the address. I almost missed the prompt, except I did get
the urge to write down the information from the phone card shown above.
When I saw the 1111 I had to laugh.  .

 I almost got a cab to the Marriott that was 
 close by because I have a reward card
with them, but I kept getting the nudge to go to the hotel right at the 
 airport.
Glad I did.

 Hi everyone  
 
 Now the next 1111 prompt comes as I&apos;m leaving 
Philadelphia about 2 hours later then
I had planned on . Obviously this was not in the plans of our 
friends. Yes, this
is one of those exact timing prompts. As I entered the main highway leaving
Philadelphia   at that exact moment the cab in the photo comes 
along side of me and then pulls ahead
and pulls in front of me so he can exit the highway 2 minutes later.
Pretty obvious that any further delay in my trip or even if I had left earlier I 
would have
missed this prompt. Now we could always say it would have occurred no matter 
what time I left. 
 

 Love and peace
Nick

 I had a great prompt occur on my trip down to 
Maryland. The trip for me takes 
 about 4 hours by car.

I was entering a major highway and as I merged with traffic, I noticed the van 
next to me
had 1111 as the last 4 digits of the business phone. He was going a lot faster
then me and I only had about 5 to 10 seconds to notice the numbers.
I like the timing of merging right next to him.
If I had been 10 seconds slower I would have missed the prompt.

I thought last year was hectic with all the traveling but I think this year is
even more crazy.

I guess I&apos;ll start with a trip I took to NYC (I&apos;ve been to Canada, 
 Louisiana, Virginia,
Chicago, and Texas since the last time I was here)
The New York trip is an example of where the timing had to be exact for
me to see my 1111 prompt. 

 
I had finished working in the elevator motor room and had just returned to 
 the street level and said goodbye to
the elevator mechanic who had worked with me. He had offered me a ride to
the bus station but I knew he had a long trip home so I told him I would 
 just walk the
two blocks to the Subway. (Turned into 6 blocks because I went the wrong 
 direction )
So if I would have gone with him I would have missed the prompt.

After walking 2 blocks I realized my mistake and walked back to the 
 building, but instead of going straight
I made a turn to walk 1 block south and then west to the subway station. As 
 I walked up to the intersection
the light changed, allowing the cars to cross in front of me. The second car 
 that passed was a Car service
and they had their telephone number on the door. Yup, the last 4 numbers 
 were 1111.

It happened so fast I couldn&apos;t have taken a picture even if I wanted to. 
 Talk about timing.

Hope everyone that celebrated Thanksgiving had one great day. Hope everyone else had a great day as well.

Peace and Love
Nick

 Well after traveling to the mail box my wife started opening the mail on the drive back to our house. When we got back in our driveway she opened the last letter and it had a check and she chuckled and said look at the check number. 
This morning my 7 year old granddaughter was playing in our front yard and right after she came into the house we looked out the bay window in our living room we see a Black Bear in the exact spot she had been playing in. We live in the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania so not that strange an event. Great incentive for a quick prayer of thanksgiving.

  Hi everyone,
Well one week of vacation is gone. One more week to go.Went to the supermarket 
with my wife and we were almost finished and she remembered one more item. So I 
stayed with the shopping cart while she went back a few isles to get one more 
thing. While I&apos;m standing with the cart I decide to pick up the bag 
of Dried Apricots and turn it over to read the Nutrition Facts. (7 Apricots 120 
calories) then I looked down at the bottom area of the bag and...surprise I 
see...
