My favorite of the local fast food burgers, also really good chicken strips and shakes(especially when the chocolate hazelnut shake is in season though the summer berry shakes are excellent to.....)  and I like the fact they like to use local ingredients.

I end up here more often than I would like, especially considering it&apos;s in Portland and Portland has a TON of restaurants. The food is fine. Maybe a bit pricey for fast food, but it&apos;s pretty good fast food so that&apos;s alright. They&apos;ve got pretty good shakes too. Service wise, I&apos;ve always been pretty impressed. The one time a year that I go up and stay in Portland for a while is with FIRST Robotics, a robotics competition that has a regional event in Portland. As such, when I go to Portland, there is also a hoard of other people in the same situation as myself. Two of the three times I went into the Burgerville in that week, it was completely filled with high-schoolers (and mentors!). And even then, the people working the counter remained friendly. Both years in which we&apos;ve hit this Burgerville, they messed up my friend&apos;s order of fries... But he just goes up and mentions it and they give him another order of fries for free. It&apos;s hard to complain when you get free stuff.

However, the best thing about this location is fairly new. Their soda machines. MY GOD THEIR SODA MACHINES. Basically you can have any soda that you want, in any flavor that you want (assuming what you want is under the &apos;Coke&apos; label). There are over 100 flavors available. I&apos;ve heard tell that most of them don&apos;t actually taste that good (something to do with how the sodas are mixed up), but I didn&apos;t notice because I was drinking diabetes in liquid form (as in, all of the flavors I could fit in one cup). One of my friends proclaimed that he wanted to marry the soda machine, and I can&apos;t really blame him. Really the main reason I wrote this review was to talk about the AWESOME SODA MACHINE. I am easily amused.

Sometimes when visiting a new city, one does not always have the luxury of having the time to find that hole in the wall, out of the way restaurant that they saw on such and such travel show special. When that time comes, the answer is almost always to settle for something fast, and something cheap. In comes Burgerville!

Before my trip to the Northwest, I had never actually seen a Burgerville before, due to the fact that they are a regional chain. However, after walking in, it felt very much like any other fast food joint one would find themselves in. The tables were a little dirty, the smell of fries was in the air, and the teenagers working there seemed less than interested in what was going on around them.

Even so, the service turned out to be better than expected, and my food was presented to me promptly. Once I returned to my hotel room, I was happy to find that it was still hot, and quite tasty. Was it anything special? No. Would I return to a Burgerville again in the future? Most definitely yes. For the price, you are going to experience a better quality burger here than you would at say McDonalds, or Burger King.

This was a fast food joint that seemed pretty atypical in its ingredients since they boast &quot;local, certified beef&quot;, Tillamook cheese, Oregon nuts, local cherries and such in their food.  I didn&apos;t order any of their burgers, but my friends did and the meat they offered in the burgers was minimal.

I got their smoked salmon salad which I was disappointed in.  Rather than chunks of salmon, it was shredded salmon in the salad with a thick, sticky raspberry vinaigrette that resembled syrup more than dressing and didn&apos;t coat the salad very well.  I&apos;ve had better salads at Wendy&apos;s!  Their chocolate cherry smoothie wasn&apos;t that great either.

Fair notice to readers, I am not a burger or fast food lover.   A friend needed some help and this is where she was, so I went. I needed to eat so I ordered the Turkey Burger and the Rosemary shoestring fries.  The total price was just under $7 which was fine.

The Turkey Burger was very bland, the bun was lack luster, the condiments were a little on the heavy side.  The fries were a bit too greasy but the taste was okay.

The staff is really nice.

I WISH I could have eaten their burgers.. .but I&apos;m on lent... so...

My review is based on service and the food I did get to eat.

Hashbrowns were delicious. comes w/ 5... but HOWEVER I ordered 2 and only got 3 in each. -__- how depressing.

I also ordered their smoothie and it honestly tasted like milk shakes with fruit. :(

My friends ordered the breakfast sandwiches and they honestly said it was mediocre. Sad.

We got there in the AM and it was pretty busy so we had to wait at least 20 minutes for our food. They were very nice though.

God-awful.

My wife and I each had a cheeseburger, and I swear to you, the meat on the burger was just barely thicker than the cheese. It was, by far, the thinnest piece of meat I&apos;d ever seen in my life. The bun felt and tasted like it had been sitting out for two days. The only flavor was stale bread and &quot;secret sauce,&quot; and since I&apos;m not a big fan of thousand island dressing, the sauce does little for me.

The fries were passable, but I give the place two stars because it has two of the coolest soda machines I&apos;ve ever seen, with more choices of beverages and flavorings than you can shake a stick at.

So, go marvel at the soda fountain. Maybe even get yourself a Lime Coke. Then take your Coke someplace with a burger that has meat thicker than the cheese.

In n Out has NOTHING on Burgerville. Sometimes I feel like going to the crowded In n Out by LAX and yelling, &quot;don&apos;t you know there&apos;s a better way?!&quot; but then I would be just another crazy Oregonian.

The milkshakes... And the sauce! I may have bought two jars of sauce during my last trip to Portland. Don&apos;t tell anyone.

Stopped in from out of town for an event at the convention center.  This place is an easy walking distance from there.  Had the Turkey Burger and a bowl of tomato soup. I&apos;m rating 3 stars instead of 2 because of their mission statement/ingredient sourcing &quot;Fresh, Local, Sustainable&quot; is awesome, the price is right, and they were quick.  The place was pretty full.  Must be a fairly popular chain here in Oregon.  The 2 star comment because I swear I ordered a &quot;cup&quot; of soup yet I was rung up for a &quot;bowl&quot; of soup.  A &quot;bowl&quot; cost as much as the burger!  Although it came highly recommended by the cashier, I was not a fan of the tomato soup.

Burgerville USA sounds like a cheesy greasy fast food joint. One expects something so homespun that yesterday&apos;s grease is on today&apos;s burger. Instead, it is MARVELOUS! While In-N-Out is the quintessential California chain, Burgerville is Pacific Northwestern. They use local products like blueberries and hazelnuts.

For a local, organic fast food chain it&apos;s unpretentious. One could easily imagine Guy Fieri dropping by to taste the burgers&amp;sweet potato fries. It&apos;s that kind of place. Here in the Bay Area, being eco-friendly tends to the preachy... but Burgerville does it unobtrusively.

I ordered the Harvest Burger, thinking it had the latest of the summer harvest. Turns out it was the veggie burger--it was EXCELLENT! The sweet potato fries and the shakes are delicious.

Chez Gourmet however sells the Burgerville &quot;Oregon Harvest&quot; burgers online and Whole Foods. http://www.chezgourmet.b… 
Yes,these can be relished here in California!

Burgerville takes &quot;do you want fries with that?&quot; to a whole new level! Dig in!

I know, I know. Burgerville is awesome for being environmentally friendly and locally based. For goodness sakes, they have three different trash baskets to separate between food, paper, and other stuff. There is even a warning label on the straw stating not to put it in a hot beverage because it is made out of corn and it will melt. I get it. That is why the price is little bit on the higher end. But I get it. It&apos;s awesome. And the burgers are delicious.

But the reason why I am giving 4 stars is this. It may have been my own ignorance but I was still little bit disappointed by it.

As you Burgerville fans may know, this month is its 50th anniversary! Yay!~ Soooo, my family and I went to yesterday to celebrate its 50th birthday along with some very special deals that Burgerville was offering. Originial hamburger = $.89. OG Cheeseburger = $.99. Etc. All excited, I ordered the OG hamburger. I wasn&apos;t quite sure what to expect but I was expecting a hamburger.

Before I go on, let me just confirm that I&apos;m not delusional. A hamburger is made with two buns, lettuce, tomatoes, beef patty(ies), mayo, and maybe mustard and pickles. Right? Or am I crazy?

Anyways, when I got my order I had to hold my tongue from saying very mean and nasty things in front of my young nephews and nieces.

A slice of beef patty that was, I swear to All Mighty, almost thin as a Time Magazine with a drop of mustard that were sandwiched between two buns. Damn. Is that what they served 50 years ago? Maybe that&apos;s why obesity in US was so low.

So like I&apos;ve said, maybe I was expecting too much from this birthday party. Was I even invited?

Same quality food. The service was good. It could use more persistent cleaning, as I had to clean the table before sitting down (paper, bits of food, and what looked like a small puddle of water). In general I don&apos;t fault a dirty fast food restaurant, because they can be quite busy. However, today it was slow. The parking lot could be bigger; thankfully we found the last space!

Overall I like Burgerville. Though, wtf is up with waffle fries being a seasonal item?

This rating is a bit skewed cuz I just got back from this Burgerville and the lady in the driveway (window #1) was super rude. And I am used to rude (I lived in DC for several years). The strawberry milkshake had way too much syrup and not enough freshness in it too.

All that said, I love their fries, Tilamook burger, and how this place is local. I think I like the burgers at 5 Guys&amp;In&amp;Out better. And no one does a burger like Killer Burger or Good Stuff (in DC).

I just wish there was one closer to us in Puyallup. We visited this Burgerville a couple times while we were in town. Everything from the burgers, chicken and the fish sandwiches were to die for.

I had the pleasure of trying their &quot;made from halibut&quot; fish fillet sandwich. Not greasy, great taste and made from halibut, not from &quot;chum&quot; like other fast food fish sandwiches. The next night I had the Rosemary chicken sandwich, that was excellent as well. My boyfriend had a burger which was delicious when he gave me a bite and the Coho Salmon burger... in which he devoured and couldn&apos;t stop talking about it there after.

We will definitely be back next year when we attend the Portland Retro Games Expo... maybe sooner!

Decent fast food....kinda spendy, but for being a drive thru, it&apos;s not bad! I really don&apos;t know why so many people compare it to In&amp;Out (which Oregon does not have!)....the only thing they have in common is the fact that they sell burgers, I think?
Anyway, If and when I do have to choose fast food/drive thru- I choose Burgerville!

Ordered the Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger with regular fries.  The food was average.  The burger patty was thin and dry.  The bacon was nice and thick, and the vegetables were fresh.  The bun was your average supermarket sesame seed bun.  Fries were acceptable.  The place is clean and focuses on being local and environmentally friendly.  OK, but just not that exciting.  $9 for combo meal.

This is a review for a fast food joint, and as far as fast food joints go, this really is as good as it gets.

I grew up in the south, so I got a LOT of McDonald&apos;s, a lot of Burger King, etc.  The closest place that I grew up with that comes in comparison to Burgerville is a Steak n&apos; Shake, which is a sit-down diner.  Mostly the comparison comes in with the Milk-shakes, for those who are familiar with Steak n&apos; Shake.  Get the Fresh fruit milk-shakes, not the standard flavor in a can milk-shakes... but that&apos;s the same as it was for Steak n&apos; Shake.

As far as comparison to other Burgers in the area, far more flavorful than Dick&apos;s restaurant, burger for burger, and unspeakably better than Red Robin. (it comes without all the kids parties too.)

Is this a gourmet burger?  No, not unless you&apos;re a fast food gourmet. Its fresh, local ingredients (that taste fresh!) in a very tasty combination.

Some words of warning.  You want to buy a Tilimook Cheeseburger or above on the menu.  The cheep burgers aren&apos;t any better than McDonald&apos;s.  Ewy.  DON&quot;T get the regular style milk-shakes.  Its flavor in a can, and you&apos;d be missing out on the fresh fruit amazingness.  Also, if its the right time of year for Rosemary fries, GET THEM. or the Fried mushroom Wedges.  Yum.

Also, this location prints your calories for you.  I, for one, appreciate this.  However, it is fast food, so you&apos;re not going to be getting low-calorie meals.  Sure, its no Burger King, but you can easily get a full day&apos;s calories in one sitting.

Also, you can go through the drive through on your bike, a total bonus.  Makes you feel less guilty about those delicious calories you&apos;re consuming.

Totally shocked at my first Burgerville experience based on Yelp reviews.  Having heard great things, we eagerly ordered Tillamook burgers and shakes.  The burger patty was bland, totally lacking flavor (seeing the employee pull the patties out of a warming tray should have been my first indication this wasn&apos;t going to be a great experience).  Where was the Tillamook cheese?  We always prepare our burgers at home with a thick slice of Tillamook cheese, but this was a thin slice that doesn&apos;t do justice to a cheeseburger, again lacking flavor.  The slices of tomato were thin as well, and didn&apos;t have the flavorful burst of, say, tomatoes in a In-N-Out burger.  The shakes were fine, nothing special.  Are people so happy about the &apos;mission&apos; of local/sustainable that they overlook that this is just another warming tray fast food restaurant?

To sum it up?  If I bought a house in Burgerville, I&apos;d be upside down on my mortgage about now.

Drive down the MLK.

Drive up the MLK.

Drive down.

Drive up.

(repeat)

Occasionally we break the cycle by stopping for Tillamook Cheeseburgers and Sweet Potato Fries.

Nothing great, but...
A) They&apos;ve never messed up my order
B) I don&apos;t instantly feel like crap afterward
C) It&apos;s local
D) You know, it&apos;s just darn convenient sometimes

Since I can&apos;t quite get a Double Double Animal Style without heading seven hours south, we&apos;ll most likely keep driving through here when in need of a fast food fix (BV kills the King, the Arches, and the little Red head).

Oh, Burgerville, USA! You tease me by extending your deliciousness from Portland all the way to Centralia and no further. Would it kill you to come on up to Seattle? Would it?? You would kick the crap out of Dick&apos;s and the cheap knock-off of you called &quot;Kidd Valley&quot;.

Spicy black bean burgers, sweet potato fries, shakes. So good and seasonal and regional ingredients. The door is always open for ya, if you change your mind, B-Ville.

This Burgerville location is very similar to all of the others. Good food (for fast food), mostly locally sourced and sustainable ingredients, high quality meats, and tasty seasonal offerings make this local chain a total winner in my drive-thru book.

This particular location is a bit of an oasis in an otherwise dead zone for food. In the netherworld between the convention center, the rose garden, and the office parks between that district and lloyd, there&apos;s not much in the way of food. Denny&apos;s, Red Robin, Sbux, and Burgerville. So this has become an emergency stop when I am needing a quick meal pre- or post-event, or one of those other random times when you just need some grub, and fast.

The lines at this place can get horrendous when Blazer games or similar events are going on at the nearby centers. The staff does a good job of handling the crush of people, but I&apos;ve still had to wait quite some time for my food due simply to the sheer volume of people. At other times, the place is a ghost town. I can get in, get food, and get out in a flash.

The food at this Burgerville beats the hell out of the food at the Montavilla location. The burgers I get are not crushed and battered, the breakfast sandwiches are warm all the way through, and, well, hey... it&apos;s chain fast food. What more description do you need?

It does the job it&apos;s supposed to do, and it does it with much more style than the major fast food chains. For that, 4-stars.

Oh, and their morning coffee is not half bad (again, for fast food).

A big part of me wishes Burgerville would stop printing nutrition information on their receipts.

You mean one bagel w/bacon and egg, a hash brown and an orange juice is 1230+ calories?

Holy shit.

I&apos;d prefer to maintain a little ignorance to what I&apos;m eating when it&apos;s early, I&apos;m starving and pressed for time.

Note to self: Buy a big tub of oatmeal and wake up earlier.

Goo... erm, Bad Morning.

These are some good burgers.  Until Carl&apos;s Jr came along they were easily the best fast food burgers in town. Now it goes back and forth.  If Burgerville has one problem it&apos;s lax quality control.  But usually, it&apos;s pretty good.

Except the fries.  Last night I had about the best Burgerville fries I&apos;d ever had, and they were kinda limp.  But tasty.  And the milkshakes are pretty freaking good.  I dunno if they five dolla good, but they&apos;re pretty good.  And they don&apos;t cost $5.

Burgerville is the best place for seasonal flavored milk shakes...prices are spendy for &quot;fast food&quot; but we still enjoy going once in awhile.

Burgerville is the Four Seasons of fast food.

All Northwest ingredients, cooked to order, and tasty! Dine in for the diner vibe or drive through so you can listen to your own music (they usually have a juke box inside).

Burgerville offers a variety of seasonal favorites: sweet potato fries, Walla Walla onion rings, chocolate-hazelnut or blackberry milkshakes (damn, all of their milkshakes are SO GOOD), strawberry shortcake, just to name a few.

I always get the Tillamook Peppered Bacon cheeseburger basket. Comes with fries and a drink for under $8. If you don&apos;t want red meat, try the Halibut Fish and Chips or Chicken Strips and Fries. They also have salads, for you anti-flesh fans.

I always get a little sad as  I pass that &quot;Last Burgerville for 25,000 miles&quot; sign as I&apos;m driving back home to San Francisco on I-5.

Burgerville could give In-N-Out a run for their money with the seasonal  milkshakes (Pumpkin at Thanksgiving, Berry during the fall),  sweet potato fries, and Tillamook cheeseburgers.

French fries that support the Oregon economy! Hells yes.

What the hell.  When Burgerville is great, I&apos;ll put &apos;em against some of the best fast food joints...but when they are off...I can&apos;t say they justify the price.  Quite frankly, I&apos;ve had more lackluster Burgerville meals than great ones.  Come to think...the great ones were always the exception to the rule.

This location has some LOOOOOOOONG ass waits.  Like some middle of SoCal In-N-Out kinda waits.  Difference is...this ain&apos;t no In-N-Out.  It&apos;s a decent burger.  Decent fries.  Long ass wait.  The kinda wait that makes you think...&quot;I waited for THIS?&quot;

For real.

I hadn&apos;t been to a fast food burger place is about three years. Me and the fiance were given a Burgerville gift card for xmas to use while we were visiting Portland. We also really wanted to try the sweet potato fries. I had a turkey burger with sweet potato fries (good stuff) and my fiance have a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries (which she enjoyed). I think our favorite part of the meal was the hazelnut milkshake.
It is great that they use local ingredients. If you are a fast food junkie then this is the place for you.

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck....it&apos;s a duck, right?

Well this place may look like a fast food restaurant, but it&apos;s definitely not the typical McDonalds, Burger King, etc.  I&apos;ve seen this place many times on my trips to Portland, and I finally decided to check it out and I&apos;m so glad I did.

Yes, the food is a little on the expensive side, but with a motto like &quot;Fresh, Local, Sustainable,&quot; I don&apos;t mind playing the extra buck for a better quality meal.  I ordered the Rosemary chicken sandwich while my boyfriend ordered the turkey club.  I was surprised by the product!  It definitely wasn&apos;t fine dining, but our food could have easily passed for a sit-down lunch at a little diner or restaurant.  My rosemary chicken was tender, flavorful, and simply done - not overly dressed.  (You can hardly ever go wrong with rosemary + chicken)  The turkey club must have been devoured in seconds, so I&apos;m guessing it was very enjoyable too.  Plus, this place serves sweet potato fries and not to mention their specialty shake for the season is pumpkin!  The shake was so creamy and delightful - a liquid pumpkin pie.

I&apos;m glad I gave this place a chance.  Definitely goes to show...&quot;don&apos;t judge a book by its cover.&quot;

P.S.  Did I mention this place has its own Rewards card??  :-D

Oh Burgerville on MLK, you saved me today!

I had no time to stop for a meal, but I didn&apos;t want to ruin my energy and bog myself down with grease and grime at another fast food establishment.  There you were, like a lighthouse on the coast, your sign brought my ship... er... car safely to your drive through window.  Where I ordered a delicious fish sandwich for $3.  It kept me going through my day and I was even able to shop at the grocery store and buy the food I actually needed, not crap my starving stomach craved.

Thanks again, Burgerville!

This is the Burgerville that is nearest to the Convention Center and my top choice if I&apos;m not already on public transit looking for something else for Lunch. To feed my inner In N Out Burger cravings, Burgerville is as close as I can get in Portland. So although there will be no &quot;Animal Style&quot; here, this is consistently good food and with the right sustainability cred. I like it here and when I&apos;m visiting the Rose City, any Burgerville is a place that I like to come back to at least once.

The only reason why I give Burgerville two stars is for:

1)  Their seasonal chocolate hazelnut milkshake.
2)  Their fish sticks (not beer battered though if that&apos;s what you like)

When I order a full meal which means a burger, fries with a milkshake it adds up to a little over $7 per person.  I understand paying a little more for quality but lately the burgers I&apos;ve been ordering there have been buns that are flat, lean on the lettuce and tomatoes and fries that taste like they&apos;ve been soaked in oil for hours.

To be fair, branches may vary depending on the staff that&apos;s handling the food.  See for  yourself, I&apos;ve included a picture of a recent Burgerville disappointment.  That&apos;s a sweet baby boy toddler&apos;s head behind the burger.  If the burger were delicious it would have covered the toddler&apos;s head!!

Fresh ingredients and local business that provides excellent food for a reasonable price. I always get the berry milkshake and of course the Burgers are to die for along with seasonal sweet potato fries. Yummy...It is a little more than your typical fast food joint, but you will be pleased with the quality and they even bring the food to you. I always take out of towners to Burgerville

This is civilized fast food. It&apos;s as simple as that. It&apos;s not a gourmet steak: that&apos;s not why we&apos;re here, but for fast food, it&apos;s pretty damn good. Plus, Burgerville proves that you can do fast food in a more local, sustainable way -- it&apos;s not that the other chains can&apos;t do the same... it&apos;s that they choose not to.

Plus, at this location, I&apos;ve generally found polite and pleasant people waiting to take your order and answer questions, suggesting things that you might like without sounding like salesmen. Service is quick and the place is clean.

I just noticed that even the receipts are pretty cool, showing the nutritional stats for your order (although this would have been nice to see in more plain view prior to ordering). What impresses me the most is how they deal with waste: even their straws are corn-based and can be composted. In our meal last night, NOTHING went into the &quot;landfill&quot; can -- it was all compostable. Very impressed.

Yeah, it&apos;s a couple of bucks more expensive than McWhatever, but it&apos;s worth every penny. It&apos;s local, it&apos;s run the right way, and it&apos;s damned good. While you&apos;re there -- treat yourself to a milkshake with whatever fruit is in season. They&apos;re always, always good.

My burger was dry, like it had been under a heatlamp since the 4th of July. The seasonal shake wasn&apos;t great either - it was thick but didn&apos;t taste or melt like milk. Maybe I caught this restaurant at an off hour, but I doubt I&apos;d go out of my way to give it a second chance.

On the plus side, the server who brought out my order was friendly.

The food as usual was good.

But the traffic into and out of the parking lot was horrendous due to positioning.

Then the drive through person kind of screwed up our order as it was somewhat complex and gave us an extra burger basket.

Ate here several times when I was visiting Portland. Enjoyed the experience even though it was somewhat pricey for fast food. One of my combo meals (turkey burger, smoothie, and onion rings) was more than $10.

The chain prides itself on using local ingredients and being sustainable, and the burgers tasted cleaner and lighter although that could be &quot;my mind be playing tricks on me&quot;.  The receipts even prints out the customised nutritional information on my meal which revealed that my habit of forgoing mayo (any sauce for that matter) saved me 100 calories.

Interior was very clean and staff was friendly. I was somewhat befuddled in having to divide my trash into separate recyclable bins depending on the material. I see this at Whole Foods but don&apos;t expect it at a fast food restaurant.

Nice flavour ideas and noble intentions. I had a pickled pepper cheeseburger. The fixings were great - spicy mayonnaise (which I refuse to call aioli if it isn&apos;t actually made from garlic), fresh baby spinach and real cheese along with the pickled peppers. Unfortunately it was let down by the beef patty itself which was dry like it had been sitting around for a while. If you&apos;re going to do something special with a burger, at least get the beef part right.

But it&apos;s certainly better than many burger chains.
