Scarcity is the basically when the demand for
something surpasses the supply of something. In
other words, if everybody wants gold, but its
supply is limited and less than the demand, it is
scarce. Sand for instance is also something people
want and use in daily life, yet is supply is
greater than the demand, therefore sand is
abundant not scarce. In the following essay I am
going to speak about the scarcity with respect to
everyday life. I will present various educated
findings together with my personal opinion on the
given matter.

Body : Part 1 Scarcity forces us to
make choices. Choices entail an alternative
foregone or given up -- the opportunity cost.
Economists assume that human beings make choices
in a rational manner, that is, they weigh the
marginal costs and marginal benefits of that
alternative. Economics focuses on the analysis of
this decision-making process. It helps us
understand how people behave (make choices and
various decisions) in the context of scarcity
(Hueting, 117). Scarcity is the most fundamental
problem in economics

Scarcity exists because
human wants and needs exceed the quantity of goods
and services that can be produced using all
available resources. Economists are fond of saying
that &quot;there is no free lunch,&quot; which means that,
even if something is &quot;free&quot; to us, there is a cost
to society in terms of the alternative foregone.
For example, if a city uses land to build a
football stadium, the best alternative for that
land is given up. If additional funds are spent
for police patrols, less money is available to
hire more teachers (Hazlitt, 34). The reality is
that cannot have everything that we want. So,
faced with scarcity, individuals, government and
society in general must make choices.

Students
make choices every day. Is watching TV the best
use of your scarce time? Is working at a fast-food
restaurant better than the best alternative job or
some other use of your time like studying French
or playing chess? Therefore, when there is a need
for food (scarcity) you are always welcome to
either start growing your own food in the backyard
or trade your activity (work) for the food and
other things you find scarce (Hueting, 119).
Whenever a choice is made, something certainly
must be given up. The opportunity cost of a choice
is the best alternative given up. Choices involve
trading off the expected value of one opportunity
against the expected value of its best
alternative. The evaluation of choices and
opportunity costs is subjective; such evaluations
differ across individuals and societies.

It should
be noted that the concept of efficient
possibilities frontier is based on scarcity and
the opportunity cost. It states that with limited
resources like labor or capital (most common
factors used for this model), a country can do a
limited number of tasks. In other words, it can
dedicate all its labor and capital to producing
automobiles but then, it would be forced to buy
everything else from other countries (Seplaki,
86). If the country decides also to produce food,
it will direct at least some people and capital to
farming which in turn will result in the declined
output for cars. As priorities grow, more and more
choices start to be made and at some point of time
it becomes apparent that the cars that the country
started to produce in the first place may now
become scarce because not much effort is directed
to cars any longer, but the scarcity of other
resources declined.

Therefore, the only wise thing
a person or a country can do in times of scarcity
is a proper choice: whether to produce it on ones
own, or to trade it (Hazlitt, 36). Later we will
learn that sometimes the countries prefer to steal
it or take it away by means of war.
