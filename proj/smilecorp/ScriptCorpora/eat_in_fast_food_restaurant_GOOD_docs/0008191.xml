 Healthy Fast Food Menu 
 Mar 28, 2011 | By Eliza Martinez Photo Credit fast food image by sanyal from Fotolia.com 
Regularly eating fast food is not a healthy choice, but it is possible to create a meal that fits within your health goals. Much of what you find in a fast food restaurant is fried and high in sodium. Many fast food restaurants are adding healthy options to their menus, which are lower in calories, fat and sodum. Most fast food establishments post the nutrition information on their websites so you can make an informed decision.
 
Fat and Calorie Content

Most fast food is too high in fat to be considered part of a healthy meal plan. Too much fat in your diet increases your risk of heart disease. A 2,000-calorie diet plan should not exceed 78 g of fat per day. Even healthy-sounding items are often poor choices. For example, the Roast Chicken and Pesto Panini at Arby&apos;s has 855 calories and 38 g of fat, but the Light Roast Chicken Deluxe only has 260 calories and 10 g of fat. A Double Quarter Pounder with cheese at McDonald&apos;s has 730 calories and 40 g of fat, but a regular cheeseburger only has 310 calories and 12 g of fat. These numbers make it clear that you should carefully read the nutrition information before you choose an item.
 
Side Dishes

Most fast food meals come with a side of fries, which are typically high in fat, calories and salt. Some fast food restaurants now offer other sides that are higher in nutrients and lower in fat and calories. Wendy&apos;s allows you to choose a side salad, with 60 calories and 3 g of fat over the Biggie fries, with 470 calories and 23 g of fat. At Subway, choose a bag of baked potato chips rather than traditional chips to save fat and calories. At KFC, choose mashed potatoes with gravy, with 120 calories and 6 g of fat over the potato wedges with 280 calories and 13 g of fat. An unhealthy side dish can ruin an otherwise healthy meal.
 
Beverages

The best way to keep fat and calories to a minimum when eating fast food is to order water or unsweetened iced tea rather than having a soda or milkshake. Sugary drinks offer little nutrition, but are typically high in calories. A medium chocolate shake at Dairy Queen contains 770 calories, 20 g of fat and 113 g of sugar and a large Frosty at Wendy&apos;s has 540 calories, 14 g of fat and 70 g of sugar. The wrong drink choice will make the calorie and fat content of your fast food meal skyrocket to unhealthy amounts.
 
Recommendations

When eating fast food, evaluate the menu selections before choosing one so you make a decision that doesn&apos;t derail your health goals. HelpGuide.org recommends ordering single-patty burgers or grilled chicken sandwiches, having a baked potato or salad rather than fries and limiting cheese, mayonnaise, salad dressing and sauces.
