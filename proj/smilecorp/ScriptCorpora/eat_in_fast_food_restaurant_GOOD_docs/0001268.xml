Only wish I had thought to order additional ones to bring home with me. My soulmate introduced me to this place after a couple days at Atlantic Beach, oh my goodness, what a deal, what a meal. Can&apos;t wait to return and bring home the goodies to enjoy at later date.

Living in the Raleigh area now, but any excuse to go to Morehead always includes a stop in to pick up a meal to eat there, and burgers to bring back. Mr. Barts is right, heated up El&apos;s is better than any other fresh burger I know. When I was stationed in California, my mother wold bring a dozen frozen superburgers to us. Talk about good eatin in Cali. They lasted for 6 days.

You can bet when I come back home to see my sisters that my family and I have to stop to El&apos;s. I would rather eat there than the Sanitary or Captain Bills. My daughters (3) all were surprised the first time that we took them to El&apos;s. They all said What&apos;s this place?.... and we want to go to McDonald&apos;s. Not any more. my youngest daughter is 18 and she can not wait to take her new boyfriend to eat at El&apos;s. Yes we always take several burgers back with us. Warmup El&apos;s burgers are better than most any other burgers,
