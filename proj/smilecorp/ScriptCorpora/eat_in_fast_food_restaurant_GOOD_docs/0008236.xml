Filet o Fish
 
I walked up to the counter ready to place my order. This was right after seeing the two for three dollar poster on the window. I was super ready for this, and a meal for $3.25? Who wouldn&apos;t be ready? Apparently not I. Right after placing the order, it sounded wrong as it came out of my mouth.&quot;I&apos;d like to have that McFish deal you got on the window out there.&quot;Wait. McFish? No...&quot;The Filet o Fish deal? Sure.&quot;Ah yes, filet o fish. It&apos;s been so long that I don&apos;t even know the name or how to order it. Chalk it up to stupidity. After paying, I went off to enjoy the wonderful meal of fast food fish.
 
I had the proper expectations for this because Blondie and Brownie talked about all the fast food fried fish options out there. But what really got my attention about this filet o fish sale was Pat telling me that this deal would be the death of him. It&apos;s simply too cheap and good enough that it&apos;s addictive.

The filet o fish has a few things going for it. It&apos;s cheap. It has a squishy bun. The fish actually looks fried. There&apos;s tarter sauce and cheese. On the other hand, it&apos;s made by McDonald&apos;s, it has a slightly fishy after-taste, and two of these packs more than 700 calories. It&apos;s probably really good bang for your buck if we&apos;re just talking about calories per dollar here. The thing is that these suckers aren&apos;t full of carbs so they don&apos;t exactly leave you full. They kind of leave you feeling slightly disgusting and somewhat guilty that you just consumed 700 calories in 90 seconds.
 
The truth is that sometimes I just can&apos;t resist. Some people are degenerate gamblers. I&apos;m a degenerate fast food eater. Yea it&apos;s bad for me, but it hurts so good. Some folks have an unreal expectation of McDonald&apos;s. Some folks genuinely love it. Some folks utterly loathe the existence of these things. I know what to expect, and even though it&apos;s not my favorite food, I&apos;d eat it. Now if they ever have those chicken nugget sales again... it is on!

naw son, you gotta get the BK Big Fish, it&apos;s a far better sandwich and when they have their King Deals, on one of those days you can get 2 for $4. Filet-o-fish is weak.

In the Harlem 125th location of McDonald&apos;s, there is a manager&apos;s special... 2 filet&apos;o&apos;fish sandwiches, medium fries, and a medium drink for $5. That kicks the pants off the small fries/small drink you&apos;d get off the dollar menu. Just an FYI.

They also have a special double fish fillet sandwich once in a while, but&apos;s only for pro&apos;s!

Also overall, the size of Mickey D&apos;s fish fillet has shrunk a bit over the past few years and they now only use a half slice of cheese.

These things are awful but I love them...Help!

@NYC,

actually I think not all McDonald&apos;s are doing this, especially in NYC. And those in Manhattan that participate, the price is probably slightly higher.

@CheebaHawk,

WHAT?! DOUBLES?!

I find the filet o fish now has a bitter after taste. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the fish or the tarter sauce. I&apos;m leaning towards the tarter sauce...

I got this &quot;deal&quot; when it first came out and shared it with the hubs. It was meh. Did yours only have a half a piece of cheese on it???

@James,

Jack in the Box makes tacos?! we need one of those here. My friends always say they would make a killing here. And yes my brother, lots of pride indeed.

@wonders,

mmmm... bitter aftertaste... I know what you&apos;re talking about. It&apos;s ok though, the shit ain&apos;t gonna kill ya for another fifty years or so.

@Eric,

haha, yes it had a full piece of cheese on it. It just wasn&apos;t so visible :P

Throw in 4 chicken nuggets and you&apos;ve just described my dinner 3 out of the last 7 days.

I&apos;m surprised you made no mention of the annoying theme song that accompanies the filet o fish.

FILET-O-FISH IS DA BEST!!! I love that squishy bun. Never eaten two in one meal though. I mean, not yet.

@Patrick,

You&apos;re my hero. And that theme song is awesome, I love it. Most people have heard of it already though. They need a new one...

@Robyn,

Yes, yes... not yet is the right response. Do it Robyn!

I once walked into McDonald&apos;s and placed an order for 100 chicken nuggets. It was one of the greatest moments of my life.

Since then, though, I&apos;ve been less and less able to eat McDonald&apos;s food without feeling physically ill... especially their breakfast options. Fortunately, my body still seems to retain its addiction to Jack in the Box tacos and White Castle sliders, so I&apos;m shooting two for three in the fast food pantheon.

Junk with pride! However twisted that may be.

I&apos;m a degenerate fast food eater too. I know it&apos;s unhealthy and all, but it just tastes so good. What&apos;s the point of eating without enjoying anyway, right?

@Su-Lin,

Yes they are addictive aren&apos;t they? Fried fish sandwiches in general seem hard to find... there are lots of fried catfish sandwiches here in the states though. They usually go by the name of po&apos;boys...

@FlavorBoulevard,

You got me! The whole point seems to be enjoyment. I mean, it makes sense to prolong life and have as much enjoyment as possible too...

I&apos;m a total sucker for these sandwiches. But then again, there are no other fried fish sandwiches near me... ;)
