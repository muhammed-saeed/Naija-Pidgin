 McDonalds -----Same old Story 

 Advantages: Regular Perfomance review including pay increase, management opportunities
 Disadvantages: Rude Customers, Lazy Management, long hours, lack of recognition


...where as the non smokers such as myself were expected to just have a 45minute break.

Within 5 months I had worked my way to training squad and was helping with the ongoing training of other members, another 6 months later I completed a floor managers course in Manchester which was pretty gruelling as it was only in a fast food restaurant but never the less passed with a fab McDonalds Floor Managers Certificate.

Pay reviews were regular but it was not a great payrise we are talking pence here and as the minimum wage went up the wages for existing employees didnt so on occassion you would find new employees only just on slightly less money it was annoying.

McDonalds is high on training and cleanliness but this all depends on your manager on shift there are lazy ones that have no idea what goes on from time to time and there are...

 McDonalds 

 Advantages: Flexible Hours
 Disadvantages: Small Pay


...I worked in a McDonalds Restaurant in Newcastle for three years and contrary to what people might have experienced I personally loved it. 

I spent most of my time there on till or on the express till as I had the best speeds in the restaurant and I found the day went fast. I did the odd shift on dining area which I admit I did not enjoy. People go into places like McDonalds and have no respect for the restaurant, people have lettuce fights, leave their trays covered in mess and spill drinks everywhere and leave them which Im sure they would never do at home or in a higher class restaurant.

I remember the thing that annoyed me most was
mopping the floor, you have to do it in two sections and put a cone at the end of each part, so first you mop all on the left hand side then when thats dry you move the cones and do the right...

 McDonald&apos;s: I CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT NOW, BUT IT WASN&apos;T FUNNY THEN!!! 

 Advantages: Frequently available job vacancies; meal allowance; choice of part-time, weekend and full-time wor
 Disadvantages: Working environment can be terrible. Long hours can be exhausting.

WORKING AT MCDONALD&apos;S 
----------------------------------------- 

I worked at MacDonald&apos;s for about 7 months when I was at university. 

I was a full time student at university, but my schedule meant that I only had lectures 3 days a week, which left me with plenty of time to fit in a part-time job. 

I had just moved to a new house with other students, and as it happened there was a McDonalds restaurant just a couple of streets away. They were advertising job vacancies, so I decided to apply. 

= 
Before I go on though, I want to issue the disclaimer that this is an account of the experience of working in ONE specific franchise of the company, among the very many in existence in Britain, not to mention the rest of the world...
