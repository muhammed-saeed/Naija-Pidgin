 Randall Jeppesen reporting 
 
 
SALT LAKE CITY -- Cosmetologists are pleading with the Utah Legislature to not deregulate hair braiding. But supporters of the move say the current law discriminates against people who just want to earn a living.
Utah currently requires people who professionally braid hair to have a cosmetology license.
Rep. Holly Richardson, R-Pleasant Grove, has introduced a bill saying if it&apos;s natural hair braiding without chemicals or glues, it should not need a license. She says this is important to several ethnic communities in which hair braiding is traditional.
But Tamu Smith, owner of Interactions Salon in Provo, argued a license is important to keep customers safe.
&quot;It can be dangerous. It can lead to permanent hair loss if it is not done correctly,&quot; she said.
Others call it a turf battle, saying beauty schools want to protect the need for hairstylists to obtain a license to do business in Utah.
Lawmakers asked Richardson to narrow the scope of the bill before any vote will be taken.
