On May 19Th-I went to this location and purchased 3 meals. There was a mistake made on one of the orders and the waitress was very sweet and issued a refund for the error. That&apos;s not the problem. A few days later I was checking my bank account and saw that I had been double charged. It happens-computer glitch. I called the next day and spoke to the manager Shelby who appeared nice and helpful over the phone. He looked up the charge and requested that I bring a printout of my bank statement and accompanying receipts to take care of the issue.He also stated that if he was not in he would leave the information so that the manager on duty could take care of the refund. I thought it was unusual that a fast food restaurant would ask a customer to go through all this for a refund, but I complied with his request. I went in today and the manager on duty name is Emuh. Me and my husband asked to speak to him privately about this matter and he refused to do so, discussing the matter on the counter with my paperwork spread out in front of other customers talking very loudly. He then retrieved the printout left for him by Shelby. Then refused a refund, stating that I should wait until next week to see if the charge would drop off!! SAY WHAT?!! WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK?!! YOUR MANAGER ASKED ME TO COME UP HERE FOR A REFUND!! He says the bank statement was wrong! Can you believe this guy? I also had all the reciepts and had ID if he needed to see it. He states&quot;You want me to just give you $20.00?&quot;This&quot;manager&quot;was very rude and unprofessional. He even had the NERVE to tell me to go take it up with my bank. I have never in life had to go to my bank for a refund from a fast food resturant. I will definately file a report with my bank for fraud , I will also be filing a BBB complaint and to Grandys corporate office. The staff treated me well, but I have no idea how this man became a manager. Perhaps this one was just a bad location , I have not been to the other ones. But take dont a chance of getting ripped off and beware!!
