 Even If Fast Food Is Not As Additive As Tobacco 
 It Still Merits A Health Warning 
  But what if some obese people are actually victims of the type
of food sold in fast-food outlets? Absurd as it may sound, there 
is a growing body of evidence pointing in this direction.
  Fats and simple sugars can act on the brain in the same way
as nicotine and heroin. 
  Even if fast food is not addictive, the lawyers will point out
that it is so bad for people&apos;s health that fast-food outlets are in effect
selling a hazardous product without providing the health warnings you might
reasonably expect such goods to carry. A restauramt that poisons people
by selling food laced with salmonella is quickly brought to book. Is
it less blameworthy to sell food loaed with calories that give people chronic
disease.?
  Like it or not, it&apos;s [legal action against obesity] a struggle
that looks necessary if we are to halt the obesity epidemic. Admonitions
from nutritionalists, politicians, and health educators seems to have little
effect. A nd history suggests that without the sustained pressure
of a legal attack, the food industry is unlikely to mend its ways . New Scientist 
Excerpts from Burgers on the Brain: 
Can You Really Get Addicted to Fast Food? 
 The Evidence is Piling Up, and the
Lawyers are Rubbing Their Hands. New Scientist 2/2003 
 Barber&apos;s class-action lawsuit was the first volley in a long-awaited 
legal assault against the fast-food industry and its role in the obesity epidemic
that is swamping the US health-care system. Inspired by the success of Big
Tobacco, the lawyers behind it believe they can force fast-food chains to
meet their fair share of the enormous cost of caring for obesity. Pulling
the strings is John Banzhaf, of George Washington University Law School in
Washington DC, who masterminded the Big Tobacco crusade.

  New and potentially explosive findings on the biological effects 
of fast food suggest that eating yourself into obesity isn&apos;t simply down
to a lack of self-control. Some scientists are starting to believe that bingeing
on foods that are excessively high in fat and sugar can cause changes
to your brain and body that make it hard to say no. A few even believe
that the foods can trigger changes that are similar to full-blown addiction. 

 Banzhaf maintains that he can win regardless. He points out that 
he doesn&apos;t have to prove that the fast-food chains are entirely responsible 
for obesity. All he has to do is convince a jury that his clients&apos; health 
problems were not entirely their own fault -- that the fast-food companies 
share the blame. Perhaps, for example, they should have labelled the food 
to inform customers of its high calorific value.  Any hint that the
food is addictive, though, would make Banzhaf&apos;s job a great deal easier. And he knows it. Banzhaf already says he believes that fast food has &quot;addictive-like&quot; 
properties. &quot;We might even discover that it&apos;s possible to become addicted 
to the all-American meal of burgers and fries,&quot; he says.

 But how can something you need for survival be addictive? The answer
could be in the food itself. The difference between a fast-food meal and
a home-cooked one is the sheer quantity of calories and fat it delivers in
one go. The US Department of Agriculture&apos;s recommended daily intake for a
normal adult male is 2800 kilocalories (11,723 kilojoules) and a maximum
of 93 grams of fat. A meal at a fast-food outlet -- burger, fries, drink
and dessert -- can deliver almost all of that in a single sitting. Biologists
are now starting to realise that a binge of these proportions can trigger
physiological changes which mute the hormonal signals that normally tell
you to put down the fork. 

 The problem is, people who gain weight develop resistance to leptin&apos;s
power, explains Michael Schwartz, an endocrinologist
at the University of Washington in Seattle . &quot;Their brain loses
its ability to respond to these hormones as body fat increases ,&quot; he says.
The fatter they get, and the more leptin they make, the more insensitive
the hypothalamus becomes. Eventually the hypothalamus interprets the elevated
level as normal -- and forever after misreads the drops in leptin caused
by weight loss as a starvation warning. 

 But you don&apos;t need to become overweight to perturb your leptin system.
The latest research suggests that it only takes a few fatty meals. In a study published in December, physiologist Luciano Rossetti of the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in New York City fed rats a high-fat diet and found
that a fter just 72 hours the animals had already lost almost all of their
ability to respond to leptin (Diabetes, vol 50, p 2786). The good news,
says Rossetti, is that these changes are reversible. &quot; But the fatter a
person becomes the more resistant they will be to the effects of leptin and
the harder it is to reverse those effects.&quot; 

  Sarah Leibowitz, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller
University in New York City, has more evidence that eating fast
food is self-reinforcing. Her experiments show that exposure to fatty
foods may quickly reconfigure the body&apos;s hormonal system to want yet more
fat . She has shown that levels of galanin, a brain peptide that stimulates
eating and slows down energy expenditure, increase in rats when they eat
a high-fat diet. In fact, Leibowitz has found that it only takes
one high-fat meal to stimulate galanin expression in the hypothalamus. When the effects of galanin are blocked, the animals eat much less fat. &quot;The
peptide is itself responsive to the consumption of fat, which then creates
the basis for a vicious cycle,&quot; she says.

 What&apos;s more, early exposure to fatty food could reconfigure children&apos;s
bodies so that they always choose fatty foods. Leibowitz found that when
she fed young rats a high-fat diet, they invariably became obese later
in life. She is still investigating what&apos;s going on, but her theory is
that an elevated level of fats called triglycerides in the bloodstream turns
on genes for neuropeptides such as galanin that promote overeating. This
suggests that children fed kids&apos; meals at fast-food restaurants are more
likely to grow up to be burger-scoffing adults .

 Rossetti&apos;s most recent studies have also found a connection between 
triglycerides and food intake. Using a catheter implanted in the brain, 
Rossetti delivered lipids directly into the arcuate nucleus -- a region 
of the hypothalamus -- to either normally fed rats or overfed rats, and then
measured their food intake for three days. In the normally fed group the
excess fats curbed food intake by up to 60 per cent. But the overfed rats
just carried on scoffing . What&apos;s more, Rossetti discovered that this
effect is not dependent on the composition of the diet, whether high-fat or
high-sugar, but instead depends on the total amount of calories.

  Hormonal changes may remove some element of free will, but
on its own that hardly means that fast food is addictive. However, there
is another strand of research that suggests gorging on fat and sugar causes
brain changes normally associated with addictive drugs such as heroin.  Repeated use of addictive substances is thought to alter the circuitry in
as yet unknown ways.

  John Hoebel, a psychologist at Princeton 
University in New Jersey , is interested 
in whether it is possible to become dependent on the natural opioids released 
when you eat a large amount of sugar. Along with a team of physiologists from
the University of the Andes in Merida, Venezuela, Hoebel recently showed
that rats fed a diet containing 25 per cent sugar are thrown into a state
of anxiety when the sugar is removed. Their symptoms included chattering
teeth and the shakes -- similar, he says, to those seen in people withdrawing
from nicotine or morphine. What&apos;s more, when Hoebel gave the rats naloxone,
a drug that blocks opioid receptors, he saw a drop in dopamine levels in
the nucleus accumbens, plus an increase in acetylcholine release. This is
the same neurochemical pattern shown by heroin addicts as they go
into opioid withdrawal (Obesity Research, vol 10, p 478). &quot;The implication
is that some animals -- and by extension some people -- can become overly
dependent on sweet food,&quot; says Hoebel. &quot;The brain is getting addicted
to its own opioids as it would morphine or heroin. Drugs give a bigger effect, but it&apos;s essentially the same process.&quot; 

 As yet no one knows how a big hit of fat and sugar compares with 
a dose of, say, heroin. But Hoebel says: &quot;Highly palatable foods and highly 
potent sexual stimuli are the only stimuli capable of activating the dopamine 
system with anywhere near the potency of addictive drugs.&quot;

  Ann Kelley, a neuroscientist at the University
of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison , has uncovered more evidence that the release of opioids in the nucleus accumbens
tells your brain to keep eating. She found that i f rats&apos; opioid receptors
are overstimulated with a synthetic enkephalin, the rats eat up to six times
the amount of fat they normally consume. They also raise their intake
of sweet, salty and alcohol-containing solutions, even when they are not
hungry. Kelley has also discovered that rats that overindulge in
tasty foods show marked, long-lasting changes in their brain chemistry similar
to those caused by extended use of morphine or heroin. When she looked
at the brains of rats that received highly palatable food for two weeks,
she saw a decrease in gene expression for enkephalin in the nucleus accumbens. &quot;This says that mere exposure to pleasurable, tasty foods is enough to
change gene expression, and that suggests that you could be addicted to food,&quot; says Kelley.
