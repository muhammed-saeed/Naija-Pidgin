 Executive Director&apos;s Report 

 The 109th Congress opened this month with new leaders in key Congressional committees. It is an exciting time, but one in which biomedical 

research should be cautious. There are new funding priorities and the Friends must continue to educate for continued investment in oral health 

research. 

 The Appropriations process will likely see some changes in its procedures, transforming the timeline. The Friends will, with so many other members 

of the oral health community, provide moving and factual testimony about the progress at the NIDCR. 

 This year is already shaping up to be a strong programmatic one. Two dates to put on your calendar: the Friends will host a Luncheon and Panel 

discussion featuring Dr. Larry Tabak, NIDCR Director, at the IADR meeting on Wednesday, March 9, 2005 between 12:00 - 2:00 p.m.; and On May 19, 2005, the 

Friends will join with patient advocacy groups, AADR and ADEA&apos;s National Affairs Committee to meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill to 

educate them on the value of oral health research to improving patient&apos;s lives. 

 Enjoy this e-newsletter and we look forward to working with you as we enter another year. 

 Sincerely,
 Alec

 Patient Advocacy Spotlight: American Behcet&apos;s Foundation 

 The American Behcet&apos;s Foundation was founded by a parent of a child with Behcet&apos;s Disease in 1978 in Orange County, California. In 1986, the 

Organization changed its name to The American Behcet&apos;s Association (ABA) and was moved to Rochester, Minnesota. Recently the name was changed 

to the American Behcet&apos;s Disease Association (ABDA) to clarify the nature of the organization. In 1987, the American Behcet&apos;s Association was 

incorporated as a nonprofit organization in the state of Minnesota and in 1989, was granted 501(c)3 tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue 

Service. In 1988, a medical advisory board was formed of Behcet&apos;s experts from around the country. 

 Mission: 
The American Behcet&apos;s Disease Association works towards the following goals: 

 Locating people with Behcet&apos;s Disease and providing them with information and support.

 Providing current and pertinent educational information to the medical community and to aid in diagnosing and treating Behcet&apos;s Disease.

 Decreasing isolation and stress from the lives of people with Behcet&apos;s Disease and their family members.

 

 Patient and Family Support: 

 The American Behcet&apos;s Disease Association Newsletter is now published Quarterly. The newsletter is a critical part of our effort to bring news of 

diagnosis, treatment, and research and support to our network.

 The ABDA ListServe is an e-mail forum supported by the ABDA where hundreds of Behcet&apos;s Sufferers from all over the world communicate as a family and 

share knowledge, advice, support and hope.

 Pamphlets, articles and books with some of the most current information about Behcet&apos;s Disease and its treatment are available online, or through 

the newsletter.

 The ABDA Website at www.behcets.com is full of information and support, including an area to post 

your story or reach out to others of similar situations.

 We continue to operate an 800 information hotline (1-800-7BEHCETS) with volunteers answering 7 days a week.

 
 
 Medicare Will Help Beneficiaries Quit Smoking 

 New Proposed Coverage For Counseling as Medicare Shifts Focus to Prevention 
On December 23, 2004, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson announced that the Centers for Medicare&amp;Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to provide new 

coverage allowing certain Medicare beneficiaries who smoke to receive counseling services that will help them quit the habit. 

 &quot;We&apos;re building on our efforts to help America&apos;s seniors help themselves to quit smoking and live longer,&quot; Secretary Thompson said. &quot;This new 

benefit, focused on treating seniors&apos; smoking related diseases, will go a long way toward reducing their risk of dying prematurely. The combination 

of lives lost, unnecessarily, and the cost of treating smoking-related diseases makes our investment in smoking cessation benefits all that more 

important. It&apos;s never too late to benefit from quitting smoking.&quot; 

 An estimated 9.3 percent of those age 65 and older smoke cigarettes. About 440,000 people die annually from smoking related disease, with 300,000 

of those deaths in those 65 and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated in 2002 that 57 percent of smokers age 65 

and over reported a desire to quit. Currently, about 10 percent of elderly smokers quit each year, with 1 percent relapsing. 

 The proposal to cover smoking cessation counseling comes in response to a June 2004 request from the Partnership for Prevention (PFP). The PFP 

requested CMS open a national coverage decision to consider coverage of tobacco cessation counseling as detailed in the HHS Public Health Service 

(PHS) 2000 Clinical Practice Guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. 

 The guideline has been endorsed by many health care and professional organizations. Based on the evidence reflected in the guideline, CMS proposes 

to extend smoking cessation coverage to beneficiaries who smoke and have been diagnosed with a smoking related disease or are taking certain drugs 

whose metabolism is affected by tobacco use. This announcement builds on a series of HHS initiatives designed to help Americans quit smoking, 

including the opening of a new national quitline (1-800-QUITNOW) and designating all HHS campuses tobacco-free. 

 &quot;The best way to prevent the serious health problems caused by tobacco is never to start using it. Millions of our beneficiaries have smoked for 

many years, and are now experiencing the heart problems, lung problems, and many other often-fatal diseases that smoking can cause. It&apos;s really 

hard to quit, but we are going to do everything we can to help,&quot; said Dr. McClellan. &quot;I especially want to urge smokers on Medicare who are just 

starting to experience heart problems or lung problems or high blood pressure to take advantage of this new help -- and more is coming.&quot; 

 CMS Chief Medical Officer Sean Tunis, M.D., said, &quot;Federal policy has acknowledged tobacco as the number one cause of preventable death for decades 

now, and CMS has taken the lead in implementing coverage policy for our seniors to deal directly with this critical health problem.&quot; 

 The proposed new coverage policy is available for review at the CMS coverage Web site 

( www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage ). The posting of this proposed coverage policy marks 

the beginning of a 30-day public comment period. After close of the comment period, CMS will have 60 days to review the comments and issue a 

final policy.

 U.S. Surgeon General Rolls Out 2005 Agenda: The Year of the Health Child 

 Begins year with folic acid recommendations for women of child bearing age including increased dosage for women at risk of Neural Tube Defects 
U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona today marked Folic Acid Awareness week by rolling out his 2005 agenda and reminding all women of 

child-bearing age to consume the recommended amounts of folic acid each day. 

 &quot;We know that the health needs of children, grow into the health problems of adulthood, so this year I will be taking a hard look at ways to 

improve the health of children both domestically and internationally,&quot; U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona said. &quot;By improving the holistic 

health of our children, we can ensure a healthier population for the next generation.&quot; 

 Dr. Carmona announced that The Year of the Healthy Child agenda will focus on improving the body, mind, and spirit of the growing child. A healthy 

child begins before birth, so the Office of the Surgeon General will highlight steps that women should take to keep themselves healthy, especially 

when they are considering becoming pregnant. This includes a healthful diet, exercise, and eliminating tobacco use and alcohol consumption. 

 It also includes taking folic acid as a vitamin supplement. Folic acid is a B-vitamin necessary for proper cell growth to ward off such birth 

defects as neural tube defects, serious birth defects of the brain (anencephaly) and spine (spina bifida). Research has shown that, if taken 

before and during early pregnancy, folic acid can prevent 70 percent of these birth defects. Therefore, every woman of children bearing age, 

even if she is not planning on becoming pregnant, should supplement her diet with 400 micrograms of folic acid each day. 

 However, women whose family history shows a high risk of Neural Tube Defects (NTDs) should take 10 times that amount: 4 milligrams. It is 

important, however, that this increased dosage be taken specifically from folic acid supplements, not by increasing the number of multivitamins 

a woman takes, because of the risk of vitamin A poisoning. Dr. Carmona urged all women of child bearing age to talk with their physician or 

other health care professional about steps they can take to keep themselves healthy. 

 &quot;Last year we started talking about the importance of charting a person&apos;s family health tree; and this latest recommendation to increase folic 

acid intake for those at risk of Neural Tube Defects is one sound reason for knowing your family&apos;s health history,&quot; Dr. Carmona said. &quot;We are 

working to bring the best scientific information to the American people. It still takes too long to get good health information from the science 

lab to the medicine cabinet. The good science that is being discovered isn&apos;t any good until it gets to the people who need it. We&apos;re working to 

bridge that gap.&quot; 

 In addition to pre-pregnancy, the Office of the Surgeon General will also focus attention on pre-natal care and childbirth and early childhood 

development, as part of his 2005 agenda. As a child grows, so does the child&apos;s health needs, so the Office of the Surgeon General will address, 

among other things, immunizations, childhood obesity, physical activity, illness and injury prevention, healthy indoor environment, child abuse 

prevention, drug and alcohol use prevention, and safe teen driving. 

 Building on Dr. Carmona&apos;s &quot;50 Schools in 50 States Initiative,&quot; the Office of the Surgeon General will continue to work with partners and school 

districts, to reach into classrooms across the country to encourage students to stay in school. In addition, the Office of the Surgeon General 

will encourage more students, especially minorities, to focus on excelling in math and in the hard sciences. The Office of the Surgeon General 

also will join with others to promote the mental health of children and adolescents. 

 And finally, the enthusiasm of children and teens is often overlooked within their communities. The Office of the Surgeon General will work to 

harness their energy and partner them with local institutions to promote volunteerism, civic responsibility, and patriotism. 
 
 2005 NIH Director&apos;s Pioneer Award Program Opens 

 The National Institutes of Health announces the 2005 NIH Director&apos;s Pioneer Award, a key component of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. 

 &quot;The Pioneer Award supports scientists of exceptional creativity who take innovative approaches to major challenges in biomedical research,&quot; 

said NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. &quot;We look forward to adding a new cohort of visionary thinkers to the outstanding group of scientists 

chosen in the first year of this program.&quot; 

 Unlike other NIH grants, which support research projects, the Pioneer Award supports individual scientists. The award gives recipients the 

intellectual freedom to pursue new research directions and highly innovative ideas that have the potential for unusually great impact. 

 The program is open to scientists at all career levels. The scientists may currently be engaged in any field of research provided they are 

interested in exploring biomedically relevant topics and willing to commit the major portion of their effort to Pioneer Award research. 

Awardees must be U.S. citizens, non-citizen nationals, or permanent residents. 

 In September 2005, NIH expects to make five to ten new Pioneer Awards of up to $500,000 in direct costs per year for five years. The first nine 

Pioneer Awards were made in September 2004 and support scientists working on a variety of challenging scientific problems. 

 The self-nomination process includes a three- to five-page essay, a biographical sketch, a list of current research support and the names of three 

references. Nominations may be submitted between March 1 and April 1, 2005, on the Pioneer Award Web site, nihroadmap.nih.gov/pioneer . 

 &quot;To maximize the diversity of those considered for Pioneer Awards, we encourage nominations from women, members of groups that are underrepresented 

in biomedical research, individuals in the early to middle stages of their careers, and scientists working in fields that have not traditionally 

been supported by NIH,&quot; said Jeremy M. Berg, Ph.D., Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Dr. Berg and Nora D. Volkow, 

M.D., director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, are co-chairs of the NIH committee that oversees the Pioneer Award program. 

 The complete Pioneer Award announcement is posted at grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-05-021.html . 
 
 New Dietary Guidelines Will Help Americans Make Better Food Choices, Liver Healthier Lives 

 HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman announced the release of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005, the 

federal government&apos;s science-based advice to promote health and reduce risk of chronic diseases through nutrition and physical activity. 

 The sixth edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans places stronger emphasis on reducing calorie consumption and increasing physical activity. 

This joint project of the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture is the latest of the five-year reviews required by federal law. 

It is the basis of federal food programs and nutrition education programs and supports the nutrition and physical fitness pillars of President 

Bush&apos;s HealthierUS Initiative. 

 &quot;These new Dietary Guidelines represent our best science-based advice to help Americans live healthier and longer lives,&quot; Secretary Thompson said. 

&quot;The report gives action steps to reach achievable goals in weight control, stronger muscles and bones, and balanced nutrition to help prevent 

chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. Promoting good dietary habits is key to reducing the growing problems of 

obesity and physical inactivity, and to gaining the health benefits that come from a nutritionally balanced diet.&quot; 

 &quot;The new Dietary Guidelines highlight the principle that Americans should keep their weight within healthful limits and engage in ample physical 

activity,&quot; said Secretary Veneman. &quot;The process we used to develop these recommendations was more rigorous and more transparent than ever before. 

Taken together, the recommendations will help consumers make smart choices from every food group, get the most nutrition out of the calories consumed 

and find a balance between eating and physical activity.&quot; 

 Eating a healthy balance of nutritious foods continues as a central point in the Dietary Guidelines, but balancing nutrients is not enough for 

health. Total calories also count, especially as more Americans are gaining weight. Because almost two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, 

and more than half get too little physical activity, the 2005 Dietary Guidelines place a stronger emphasis on calorie control and physical activity. 

 The Dietary Guidelines, based on the latest scientific information including medical knowledge, provides authoritative advice for people two years 

and older about how proper dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines were prepared 

in three stages. In the first, a 13-member Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee prepared a report based on the best available science. In the 

second stage, government scientists and officials developed the Dietary Guidelines after reviewing the advisory committee&apos;s report and agency and 

public comments. In the third stage, experts worked to translate the Dietary Guidelines into meaningful messages for the public and educators. 

 The report identifies 41 key recommendations, of which 23 are for the general public and 18 for special populations. 

 They are grouped into nine general topics: 

 Adequate Nutrients Within Calorie Needs Weight Management Physical Activity Food Groups to Encourage Fats Carbohydrates Sodium and Potassium Alcoholic Beverages Food Safety 

 The Dietary Guidelines provide health education experts, such as doctors and nutritionists, with a compilation of the latest science-based 

recommendations. Consumer-friendly materials such as brochures and Web sites will assist the general public in understanding the scientific 

language of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and the key points that they can apply in their lives. To highlight those points, a consumer-oriented 

brochure accompanies the 2005 Dietary Guidelines. USDA&apos;s Food Guidance System also will serve as a tool to educate consumers on the Dietary 

Guidelines for Americans. The Food Guidance System, currently called the Food Guide Pyramid, is undergoing revision and will be released in 

the spring of 2005. 

 The 2005 Dietary Guidelines and consumer brochure are available at www.healthierus.gov/dietaryguidelines . 
 
 Teen Years Tough On Teeth Hormones, Other Factors To Blame For Wreaking Havoc On Oral Health 

 Parsippany, NJ - Preteen and teen years may prove some of the toughest for teeth. While every stage of life brings a new set of oral health 

issues, the mouth is often beset by unique combinations of internal and external factors such as hormones, social pressures and lifestyle changes, 

often converging with deleterious effects on teeth. 

 &quot;As kids become more independent, their diets, hygiene and fashion choices combined with physiological changes can result in damage to teeth and 

gums,&quot; said Dr. Scott Navarro, dental director, Delta Dental Plan of New Jersey. &quot;Adolescents should be encouraged to keep up their good, lifelong 

oral health practices and be aware of certain relevant risk factors.&quot; 

 Dr. Navarro said that those factors include: 

 Hormonal changes: Hormones released in puberty can cause increased blood circulation in the gums, and the American Academy of Periodontology 

says that &quot;during this time, the gums may become swollen, turn red and feel tender.&quot; Talk to your dentist if your teen experiences any of these 

symptoms. A dental professional can prescribe a treatment program that helps maintain healthy gums and teeth during periods of hormonal change.

 Diet: As teens spend more time with friends outside the watchful eyes of parents, they often acquire new diets that are abundant in sugary, 

starchy foods and sweetened drinks. To minimize the risk to teeth, teens should brush often in the course of a day and drink lots of fluoridated water.

 Contact sports: Oral injuries are often permanent, but many can be prevented by wearing a mouthguard while playing sports. Whether 

mouthguards are fitted by a dentist or purchased off-the-shelf, teens should keep them clean by rinsing the guards often and storing them in 

ventilated containers.

 Eating disorders: Eating disorders are very serious and can cause many health problems, including damage to the teeth and gums. Bulimia 

and anorexia can lead to inflammation of the gums, erosion of tooth enamel, cavities and, potentially, can result in the loss of teeth. A dentist 

can usually treat the oral health problems but cannot treat an eating disorder. If you suspect that an adolescent has an eating disorder, seek 

medical help right away.

 Mouth piercing: Jewelry in the lips or tongue can chip teeth, scrape gums and cause other problems as well, including serious infections.

 

 &quot;For most teenagers, remaining vigilant about oral hygiene should help them get through the teen years with their oral health intact,&quot; said Dr. 

Navarro. &quot;As always, it remains important to brush at least twice daily, floss once each day and visit a dentist regularly for checkups.&quot; 
 
 Eating Fast-food is Associated with Weight Gain and Insulin Resistance in Young Adults 

 Eating at Fast-food Restaurants More than Twice Per Week is Associated with More Weight Gain and Insulin Resistance in Otherwise Healthy Young 

Adults 
Young adults who eat frequently at fast-food restaurants gain more weight and have a greater increase in insulin resistance in early middle age, 

according to a large multi-center study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and published in the January 1 issue of 

The Lancet. 

 After 15 years, those who ate at fast-food restaurants more than twice each week compared to less than once a week had gained an extra ten pounds 

and had a two-fold greater increase in insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease. 

 &quot;Obesity and diabetes are on the rise in this country and this important study highlights the value of healthy eating habits,&quot; NHLBI Acting 

Director Barbara Alving, M.D. said. Fast-food consumption has increased in the United States over the past three decades. &quot;It&apos;s extremely difficult 

to eat in a healthy way at a fast-food restaurant. Despite some of their recent healthful offerings, the menus still tend to include foods high in 

fat, sugar and calories and low in fiber and nutrients,&quot; lead author Mark Pereira, Ph.D., assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of 

Minnesota said. 

 Participants were asked during the physical examinations given as part of the study how often they ate breakfast, lunch or dinner at fast-food 

restaurants. Researchers found that the adverse impact on participants&apos; weight and insulin resistance was seen in both blacks and whites who ate 

frequently at fast-food restaurants, even after adjustment for other lifestyle habits. 

 According to the study, men visited fast-food restaurants more frequently than women and blacks more frequently than whites. Black men reported 

an average frequency of 2.3 visits per week in 2000-01. White women had the lowest frequency, at an average of 1.3 visits per week in 2000-01. 

 &quot;It is important to watch carefully what you eat, especially at a fast-food restaurant. Knowing the nutritional content is important. Consumers may 

want to ask for this information,&quot; NHLBI&apos;s Gina Wei, M.D., project officer for CARDIA said. Keep portion sizes small, and ask that high-fat sauces 

and condiments, such as salad dressing and mayonnaise, be &quot;on the side&quot; and use them sparingly to reduce calories, Wei said.

 Meeting To Draw Attention to Latest Research About Inhalant Abuse 

 More than 17 Percent of 8th Graders Report Having Used Inhalants 
According to the 2004 Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, lifetime inhalant use for 8th graders increased significantly 

in the past year with more than 17 percent reporting having purposely inhaled potentially toxic vapors often found in common household products. 

 To bring attention to inhalant abuse, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health, hosted a meeting, &quot;Inhalant Abuse: 

An Increasing Problem in Youth,&quot; on Tuesday, January 11, 2005. The meeting will coincide with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America&apos;s 

(CADCA&apos;s) National Leadership Forum XV. 

 This CADCA forum is the nation&apos;s largest training conference for community coalition activists and substance abuse professionals, featuring more 

than 80 workshops on the latest research in the substance abuse prevention and treatment fields. 

 The MTF survey, funded by NIDA and released in December 2004, showed that lifetime use of inhalants among 8th-graders continued to rise - increasing 

from 15.8 percent of 8th graders in 2003 to 17.3 percent of 8th graders in 2004. 

 &quot;To reverse this alarming trend, NIDA will be working with CADCA and other partners to educate parents, children and others that inhalants - often 

common household products (glue, shoe polish, gasoline) - can create potentially deadly vapors and can cause serious damage to major organs, 

including the brain, liver, heart, kidneys, and lungs,&quot; Dr. Nora D. Volkow, NIDA Director, explained. &quot;We&apos;ll also use the Internet to inform the 

public about inhalant abuse. Those who are interested can log onto NIDA&apos;s new website, www.inhalants.drugabuse.gov , for the latest information about inhalant abuse. 

NIDA also has just published an Inhalants Community Drug Alert Bulletin that will be distributed online and in hard copy to organizations and

 Children&apos;s Dental Health Project Receives Grant to Study Dental Students 

 Assessing graduating dental student characteristics that may impact their willingness and competency to care for vulnerable populations is the goal 

of a project being conducted by the Children&apos;s Dental Health Project (CDHP) in Washington, DC. The project is funded by a $7,500 grant from the 

United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and will produce information for use in upcoming dental workforce discussions in Kansas. 

 Using surveys of graduating dental students, the project examines trends in dental students reported attitudes regarding issues of dental access, 

by analyzing responses to questions on issues of access, professional responsibility, and the impact of their dental training experience on care for 

the underserved. Analysis of these trends may help policymakers understand why only a minority of dentists nationwide treat Medicaid patients. 

&quot;Certainly low reimbursement rates are the major reason dentists don&apos;t participate in Medicaid, but not the only reason,&quot; said Burton L. Edelstein, 

DDS, MPH, CDHP&apos;s Founding Director. &quot;This project will allow us to begin a critical analysis of the future dental workforce, and lay the groundwork 

for bolstering the safety net through effective dental student education,&quot; he continued. 

 Dr. Edelstein, a Columbia University professor of dentistry and public health, founded CDHP with support from the American Academy of Pediatric 

Dentistry, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Dental Education Association. CDHP offers research and advocacy-related strategic consulting 

services and forges research-driven policies and innovative solutions by engaging a broad base of partners committed to children and oral health.

 S. Paul Ehrlich, Acting Surgeon General, Dies 

 By Patricia Sullivan, Washington Post Staff Writer 

 S. Paul Ehrlich, 72, acting Surgeon General under Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter and U.S. representative to the World Health Organization, died 

of pneumonia Jan. 6 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach, Fla., near where he lived for the past eight years. He had multiple sclerosis. 

 Dr. Ehrlich, who was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1973 and served until 1977, was among six Surgeons General who in 1994 urged Congress 

to ban smoking in public buildings and to enact stricter controls on secondhand smoke and the sale and advertising of tobacco. 

 He also appeared with other former officeholders to oppose a proposed federal policy responding to the spread of AIDS by requiring minors to get 

parental consent before receiving contraceptives and information on birth control. 

 The Surgeon General&apos;s job has been politically controversial for years; in 1998, Dr. Ehrlich told students at Johns Hopkins University&apos;s School of 

Public Health that his biggest accomplishment was simply keeping the office open. He is also credited with saving the U.S. Public Health Service&apos;s 

commissioned corps. 

 &quot;He did more than anyone I&apos;ve ever known for American health,&quot; Dr. C. Everett Koop, Surgeon General under President Reagan, told the Associated 

Press. &quot;The role of a man like Paul Ehrlich is not to make big discoveries or to move mountains... It is to provide the steady, experienced 

leadership for the public health in this country.&quot; 

 Born in Minneapolis, he earned two bachelor&apos;s degrees at the University of Minnesota, one in 1953 and the other in 1955. Two years later, he 

received his medical degree there. He served as a medical officer in the Coast Guard and then earned a master&apos;s degree in public health at the 

University of California at Berkeley in 1961. 

 Dr. Ehrlich worked for the Public Health Service for 25 years. He researched the relationship of cholesterol to heart disease and then became 

director of the Office of International Health, representing the United States at the World Health Organization. At age 38, he became one of the 

youngest people to achieve a flag rank in the Public Health Service&apos;s uniformed services. 

 After four years as acting Surgeon General, he was vice president of the American Institutes for Research and deputy director of the Pan American 

Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization. 

 He taught at Georgetown University&apos;s School of Medicine, the University of Texas School of Public Health and the School of Public Health at the 

University of California at Berkeley. 

 He received the Public Health Service&apos;s Outstanding Service Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal and Meritorious Service Medal. 

 He retired after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 1981. 

 Survivors include his wife of 45 years, Geraldine McKenna Ehrlich of Delray Beach, Fla.; three daughters, Susan Ehrlich of San Francisco, Paul 

Ehrlich of Hendricks, Pa., and Jill Ehrlich Robinson of Ankara, Turkey; and a grandson.
