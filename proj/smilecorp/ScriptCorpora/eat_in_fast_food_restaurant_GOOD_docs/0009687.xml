Restaurant Nutrition Facts: How to Eat Healthy at Fast Food Restaurants
 












Since many of us eat out more than we eat in these days, learning about restaurant nutrition facts is extremely important. Most restaurant dishes are overloaded with calories , sodium , refined carbohydrates , fats , and artificial ingredients.

 



The good news is many restaurants now state the nutritional information of their dishes on their websites. While some companies have been slower than others to list their restaurants&apos; nutrition facts, many have recently made their nutrition information publicly available due to increased pressure from consumer health advocacy groups and the U.S. government.









However, take the accuracy of this information with a grain of salt. A recent study published in the July 2011 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association compared laboratory measurements of calories in 269 food items with the restaurants&apos; stated calories. Researchers found that 19% of food items had at least 100 calories more than listed, which suggests calorie counts for individual foods can be misleading. On average though, food items measured only ten calories higher than the restaurants&apos; stated calories.


Here are the restaurant nutrition facts for some of the most popular places to eat in the U.S. For each eating establishment you&apos;ll see nutrition information for all food items on their menu, printable nutrition charts, and our recommendations for the healthiest menu options from each.

 The True Cost of Fast Food 


Fast food has become a staple in the average American diet, and that’s not a good thing. Obesity rates are at an all time high , and the fast food industry deserves a lot of the blame. Consider this: Americans are now spending over $140 billion on fast food each year! There are now over 25,000 fast food chains in the U.S., an increase of more than 1,000% since 1970.
Fast food restaurants spent $294 million on marketing messages aimed at children in 2007. A cheeseburger happy meal with fries and a Sprite at McDonalds has 640 calories and 24 grams of fat. This is over half of the total calories many children should be eating in a day!


Fast food restaurants are like any other company in that their goal is to increase profits in order to please shareholders. The best way to do this is to get people to buy more of their products and they’re doing a good job of accomplishing this goal. The average serving size for burgers, fries, and sodas has more than tripled since the 1970’s!
The always-popular Whopper at Burger King has 670 calories and 39 grams of fat. Add a large order of fries with your order and another 500 calories, 28 grams of fat, and 6 grams of the artery-clogging trans fat . Throw in a large Coke and you add 290 more calories and 79 grams of sugar. The grand total for this “Value Meal?” 1460 calories and 67 grams of fat! 


 
 Eat Fast Food, Gain More Weight 

 A study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute found that those who ate at fast food restaurants more than twice per week compared to those who ate there less than once a week had gained an extra ten pounds and had a two-fold greater increase in insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
Considering the average American eats fast food an average of two times per week, it’s no wonder 1 out of every 3 Americans is obese.

Despite all the shortcomings of fast food restaurants, there have been more and more additions of healthy menu options because of pressure from consumers, doctors, nutritionists, and public interest groups.
We&apos;re starting to see more and more restaurant nutrition facts being made publicly available. Certain states have now required restaurants to post nutritional information, and this is a crucial step in educating people about what they’re eating.
To write to the legislators in your state about supporting menu labeling, click on the following link to the Center for Science in the Public Interest’s website . It only takes a minute and could make a world of difference.




 
 8 Tips for Eating Healthier at Fast Food Restaurants 

1. Skip the soda . They’re full of sugar and empty calories. A large soda can run over 300 calories and 80 grams of sugar: 2-3 days worth for someone trying to lose weight
2. Skip the fries . They’re deep fried in unhealthy oils and often contain trans fats. See above ... a large order of fries may contribute over 500 unnecessary calories to a meal. Order just the sandwich and get a side salad instead. Your waistline will thank you later
3. Choose your salads wisely . Some salads at fast food restaurants have over 1,000 calories. Check the nutrition label for the amount of fat, sugar, and sodium. Most fast food chicken is very high in sodium too
4. Stay away from burgers and “crispy” chicken options . Choose grilled chicken options instead
5. Watch out for $1 menus . Some of the worst foods culprits are here. Look for fruits, veggies, baked potato, or chili if they’re available
6. Order your sandwich without the sauce . Mayo and other fat-filled sauces contribute a lot of extra calories and saturated fat 
7. Choose whole grain or whole wheat bread options or order a &quot;bunless&quot; burger or sandwich
8. Ask to see the restaurant nutrition facts before you order ... or look online so you&apos;re prepared when you get there!
