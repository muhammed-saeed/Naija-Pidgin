A new bridge has been lifted into place over the M56, following three weekends of closures on a stretch of the road in Greater Manchester and Cheshire.

The new 1,830 tonne structure replaces the old Bowdon View Bridge, which links the M56 and the A556 at junction seven.

The stretch of motorway will remain closed between junctions nine and six until 0500 GMT on Monday, as final alterations are completed.

The Highways Agency is advising motorists to follow diversions.

It was warning football fans travelling to the Manchester United v Tottenham game at Old Trafford to allow extra time for their journeys.

The work was initially planned to take two weekends but was extended to three after demolition work took longer than expected.

The new bridge was constructed at the side of the motorway before being lifted into place on Saturday.

Matt Sweeting, Highways Agency Regional Performance Manager, said:&quot;We would like to thank motorway users for their patience and support over the last two weeks and ask them to bear with us again this weekend while we finish the job.

&quot;Regular users of the M56 will appreciate this is an essential scheme being carried out to ensure the long-term safety and reliability of journeys for all those who use this key commuter route.&quot;
