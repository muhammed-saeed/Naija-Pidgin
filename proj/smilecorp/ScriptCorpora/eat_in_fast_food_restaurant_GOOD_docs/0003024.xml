Stories of Hope–Changing Lives
 
 Co uple with Nothing Find Hope

 David lost his jobs about six months ago and he and his wife Christy moved in with family members’ and were living in their basement. They had nothing. They learned about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and were referred to the Hoy Cross Conference. The volunteer caseworkers use the EarnBenefits program to find other benefits for which the couple might qualify. David and Christy were given a voucher to use at the Chamblee Family Support Center.

When they came to the FSC, the couple learned how about the Client Choice Food Pantry and a volunteer guided them by through the process of selecting food. Their voucher provide for household and personal items. The volunteer took them to the voucher area of the Donation Processing Center. The couple found a microwave, toaster and clothing­­– all the things they needed.  The volunteer noticed the two of them chatting quietly.

“We need a lot of these things but we will leave some of those items for those who are less fortunate than we are,” they told her. They only took what they needed and left other items behind for someone else. The couple was grateful for what they had received from St. Vincent de Paul – Hope.  Their lives were changed just by knowing someone in the community was there to help. Our lives were change by their simple and humble act of mercy and generosity.
 
Running for Hope

 Last month we had a great day at the annual Hunger Walk Run, sponsored by the Atlanta Community Food Bank.  We thank everyone who supported this event of which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is a benefiting partner. It is always wonderful to see so many people come together to fight hunger in Georgia!  As we chatted with people, we learned some interesting stories.

Robert was pushing a stroller with his young daughter on board when he asked I few were with St. Vincent de Paul. He noticed the SVdP Hunger Walk T-shirts. He told us that his wife had run a 5K race the day before, but when they heard about the event at their parish that morning, they decided to come  down to Turner Field to see how they could participate. His wife decided to tune the HWR 5K race.

We expressed our sincere gratitude. Then he shared that when they were first married, they went through some financial difficulty and SVdP had helped them through those rocky times.  He was very grateful and said that now that they are financially stable, they look for opportunities to give back.

How grateful we are to be able to plant seeds that blossom into hope!

 

 

 

 
 
 Home Visit Delivers Hope
 
 

 Anika was experiencing a financial crisis. She was laid off from her job of more than 4 years causing her to fall behind in paying her rent and car note.  She reached out to family and friends, but no one could help her. Then she learned about St. Vincent de Paul. She called the SVdP client assistance line and was connected with a Vincentian, Tommy.  He made an appointment for two Vincentians to visit with Anika in her home. Anika was so impressed by how she was treated that she wrote to SVdP to tell us about her experience and to express sincere gratitude. She said that she felt so honored and special that they came to her home.  She felt blessed to find someone who cared about her needs, especially in these difficult economic times. 

 The local St. Vincent de Paul Conference was able to help Anika catch up on paying her rent, car note and some utility bills. She has since found a new job and was expecting to receive her first paycheck. 

 She wrote, “I want to thank [the Vincentians] and [encourage] St. Vincent de Paul to keep up the great work you are doing for people who are in need of help.” 

 
 
 
 

Kindergarten Bake Sale Raises Funds for SVdP

 Thank you to the kindergarten students, teachers and parents at St. Catherine of Siena School for holding a Bake Sale to raise funds for St. Vincent de Paul Atlanta.  We were surprised and delighted to receive the note and check. We feel blessed to have these wonderful young people learning about charity and giving. Thank you!
 
Kindness and Compassion Bears Great Fruit

 I was at Office Depot in Chamblee this morning picking up some materials to make binders for the Spiritual Advisor Handbook.  The sales person was very helpful and courteous, going above and beyond to make sure I got the supplies I needed.  In passing, she asked what I was using the binders for.  I told her I worked for SVdP and they were training materials.

Adele told me that she lived in Fayetteville and that SVdP had been very kind to her.  She was pregnant with twins and she needed to be on bed rest for eight months, which really put her family in a difficult situation.  It was nearing Christmas and they were praying they would be able to stay in their house.  They had never faced difficulties like this before.

“I remember Mary Lou, her face, and how very kind she was to us.  She brought presents and a whole laundry basket full of food for Christmas dinner,” she said.  As she told the story, tears welled up in her eyes.  I asked how old her girls were, and she said four years old.  Although this happened four years ago, Adele still has a vivid memory of the kindness shown by Mary Lou and SVdP.

She asked that if I could, to let Mary Lou know how grateful she is.

She is now a manager in training at Office Depot and she is hoping to be assigned to the store in Newnan, so it will be closer to home.  I told her she did a great job at customer service.  She said that it’s all about having a servant heart.

She tells her co-workers each morning, “Remember a servant heart.”  She said the other managers are more traditional corporate saying, “all we owe them is direction and a paycheck.”  But she read the book At the Speed of Trust which talks about how important trust is.   The other managers ask her why it’s easier for her to get her group to do more work, more quickly?  She says it’s because of trust.

It’s people like Adele, and people like Mary Lou that give purpose and meaning to what we do each day for SVdP.
 
A Never-ending Circle of Hope

 Gary called because he was having trouble making a donation online through the St. Vincent de Paul Web site. St. Vincent de Paul’s development support manger called him back after checking on the website.

She had discovered that the website was working fine and thought she might be able to walk Gary through the process to make it easier for him. After playing phone tag all day long, she was finally able to reach Gary.

The conversation began with Gary being upset and agitated.  He was frustrated. St. Vincent de Paul’s development support manger helped him through the process. He had not noticed the special box where a special code needed to be typed.  As they wrapped up their conversation, Gary shared why he was so emotional about giving to SVdP.

At one time, Gary had been a client. When he was in need of help and feeling very low, SVdP had helped him. Now that he is more stable and self-sufficient, he felt compelled to give back.

St. Vincent de Paul helps people because it is the right thing to do, How wonderful when those we help pass that grace on to others, who may pass it  on to another and so on, creating a never-ending circle of hope.

 
 
Grateful for Help

 Janice came to the St. Vincent de Paul Family Support Center to have her tax return prepared through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA).  She was hopeful that she would receive a refund that could pay for some dental work she needed.

As the volunteer preparer chatted with Janice, Janice explained how hard she worked and how the previous year her income tax refund had allowed her to do the first phase of repairing her neglected, hence damaged teeth. Often when people struggle on the edge of poverty the first thing they have to stop doing is paying for medical attention.

When the volunteer preparer got to the bottom line on the tax return, Janice’s hopes were dashed. She was getting back only half as much as she received the prior year. She smiled and thanked the preparer and said she would only be able to do half the work, but in time she was sure she will get all of her teeth repaired. She was grateful for the help and grateful for St. Vincent de Paul.
 
Making a Difference

 

Sydney called St. Vincent de Paul assistance line for help with her electric bill. The SVdP caseworkers visited her at her home and discovered that two women were living in the rented mobile home for three months with no furniture and were sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor.

Both women had escaped abusive relationships and were living together in an effort to pool resources so they could start over. Sydney was working at the local hotel as a housekeeper but she has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The other client was unable to work and under the care of psychiatrist.

After assessing the situation, the Vincentians provided a $100 grocery store gift card started arranged donated furniture from the SVdP storage and other agencies. In a couple of days, two sofa beds and other furniture were delivered to these Sydney and her roommate.

The Society was also able to pay their electric bill and will maintain contact with Sydney and her roommate to provide assistance in contacting other government and outreach organizations. Sometimes making a difference means giving a little help,  showing that someone else cares and giving a little hope.

 
 
A Ramp of Hope

 Recently, St. Vincent de Paul Society in collaboration with the Greensboro Knights of Columbus Council, helped to build a wheelchair ramp for Helene, a patient who is wheelchair/walker bound. Confined to her home, Helene found it extremely difficult to get up and down the stairs to her home. Within a couple of weeks of the call from the Home Care Agency, the Knights of Columbus with the financial support of SVdP built a ramp within two days. Helene is now able to get in and out of her home with ease. Because of your  kind donations, SVdP can continue to assist those like Helene. Please continue your financial support and prayers for our caseworkers and neighbors in need.
 
A Little Help Goes a Long Way

 Lucy called SVdP for help with their electric bill. In 2009 SVdP gave a used car to Lucy so she could transport her daughter, Connie, who has cerebral palsy. Because she must care for Connie, this single mother does not work outside the home. She receives Social Security benefits for her daughter, food stamps and lives in government housing. Lucy manages by adhering to a very tight budget. She must always be sure she has $200 per month so she can transport her child to doctors in Augusta, Madison, Athens and Macon for required medical care.

Due to many days of extreme heat this past summer, Lucy had accrued high electric bills and necessary repairs on her car added more stress to an already stretched budget. Lucy just didn’t have enough to meet all these expenses in her budget. She needed help. During the home visit, the Vincentians found that Connie, Lucy’s 5 year old daughter was doing as well as can be expected and enjoying going to school fulltime. She really enjoyed her classmates. Lucy was taking online Health Care Classes with the intent to be able to work part time while her daughter attends school.

The local SVdP Conference paid her electric bill and encouraged her effort to finish her online studies. When living on a tight budget, like Lucy was, even a small change—like hot weather—can throw off the whole budget. Just a little help from SVdP will go a long way for this caring and ambitious mother. You can’t buy hope; but you can give it!
 
Job Loss Turned into New Careers 

Chris and Jeff worked for the same company and when it downsized, both lost their jobs. They decided to use their unemployment funds to change their professions and go back college. Chris decided to become a registered nurse, while Jeff decided to become a master chef.

They called SVdP to help with their electric bill since both of their unemployment had come to an end and their educational grant hadn’t started. Two Vincentians meet with the couple and were very impressed. Since SVdP’s mission is to empower people to achieve self-sufficiency, SVdP helped Chris and Jeff.

Jeff completed his culinary associate degree and has been promised a position at the school after graduation. Chris has the highest GPA in her nursing class and just received the school’s President’s Award for outstanding achievement at her college. Her school wants her to become a nursing instructor after passing her RN boards.

 
 
Escape to a Brighter Future 

Donna escaped from abusive parents and then from an abusive husband. She arrived at a home for those who have escaped domestic violence and went through rehabilitation at that site. When she was discharged, she had nowhere to go. Her car was inoperable; she had no home, few clothes, no furniture and two children, sharing custody with the father who was not abusive to children, but worst of all, she had no safety net.

She was resourceful.   She contacted DFACS, where she arranged for food stamps for the children. She found a job at a pizza restaurant and impressed the manager enough that the manager was willing to sign connect the power at the manufactured home, which she rented with support from an organization which helps with temporary shelter and SVdP.

The Vincentians who met with her were convinced that they should help…The St. Vincent de Paul Society paid part of her first month rent and arranged for furniture for her home. They arranged for pro bono legal counsel, which secured child support and other cash settlements from the children’s father. They provided utensils, clothes and a TV for the family to use for DVD’s. They paid her first month’s power bill and provided hand tools, locks for the home, and bug infestation sprays. They also worked with legal counsel to get out of arrangement with a mechanic to fix her car at an outrageous price. Interestingly, legal counsel is a car buff who is fixing her car at a very nominal cost.

Donna is working to rebuild her life and is well on her way, thanks to SVdP and others who helped her when she needed support the most.
 
Driven to Take Care of His Family 

The Charles was employed at a Returns Center making approximately $35,000 per year, had purchased a nice home and was doing well until the company closed.  Immediately, he found a part-time job at a national hotel group, making much less money, but as he said, “At least it’s a job.  I have to take care of my family.”

He had made such a good impression on his employer that during the summer he was given full-time hours and permitted to put his name into other departments to work overtime.  This helped a great deal but he had fallen behind two months on his electric bill and two months on his mortgage when he called St. Vincent de Paul.

The SVdP caseworkers arranged to meet with Charles. On the day they met him, he had worked a full shift (7a.m.-3 p.m.), drove home to participate in the required home visit and immediately left to return to work another shift (5-11 p.m.) in catering. The Vincentians who met with Charles were impressed with his work ethic and his desire to take care of his family on his own.

St. Vincent de Paul was able to pay one month mortgage ($1,000) and $150 towards his power bill by partnering with three other local churches.

A week later, the client called the SVdP caseworker excited that he may not need as much financial help since he would be getting an additional check for his overtime in that month. WOW!! What a refreshing call to receive! Charles was very appreciative and thankful for SVdP’s help. He stays in contact with the caseworker and is currently working to refinance with his mortgage company with the hope of making ends meet more easily.

 
 
Desperation and Tears

 Each week two Vincentians make the long drive to Chamblee from Blairsville to participate in the Perishable Food Distribution Program.

St. Vincent de Paul, in partnership with Kroger and other grocery retailers, have joined together to fight hunger in north Georgia.  Each month SVdP will pick up about 35,000 pounds of perishable food from designated stores to re-distribute to clients through the Society’s four Family Support Centers, 38 Conference food pantries  and specified partner agencies.  The area for this distribution is within the 35 counties of north and middle Georgia served by SVdP Atlanta.

Since the Blairsville Conference doesn’t really have facilities to store the frozen meats, breads and dairy products, they use a unique model to distribute the food. The day before they come to pick up, they notify the interested clients that they will have food to distribute when they return the next day.

They drive down to the SVdP Chamblee location and load up their vehicle. When they return, they distribute the food from the back of the car at an agreed upon location.

The economy of the Blairsville area is so depressed that at first many of the clients had not eaten meat for several months! They cried when they received the packages of frozen meat. Imagine not being able to provide this basic food group for your children! Good quality protein is essential to good health and well-being.

The dedication of these few Vincentians is feeding the future and offering hope for better days to come.
 
Hope Through Respect and Dignity

 Craig called to say thank you. The tremble in his voice revealed that he was on the verge of tears. He apologized for getting emotional; life has been difficult for him. Craig shared that he had reached out to SVdP through the client assistance line which he learned of from the United Way. Craig suffers from Huntington’s disease and has witnessed all of his brothers and sisters suffer the ravages of this relentless illness. They have all succumbed to the illness and he often feels alone and forgotten.

After calling SVdP, Craig waited for a call back. He shared that he wasn’t particularly optimistic, but then Dean called. Dean is a caseworker for a local SVdP Conference. He told Craig that he and his partner would like to meet him in his home.

The two Vincentians arrived right on time. Craig said he was surprised and grateful for the way he was treated. He said the two caseworkers showed the utmost in professionalism, gentleness and helpfulness. He told them that he needed to have extensive dental work done.  As difficult as it is to fight Huntington’s disease, Craig really needed to be able to eat a nutritious diet in order to maintain a useful level of functioning. Bad teeth made that difficult for him to do.

The Vincentians listened to Craig’s story. They heard his concerns and witnessed his needs. Ultimately, they were able to provide all the funds needed to pay for his dental work.

Craig called to make sure the two Vincentians knew how grateful he was. He was losing hope and in the middle of his hopelessness, Dean had seen a possibility and future even Craig had lost sight of. He became emotional when he said that they had seen a miracle in him and had responded to him like he was worth something. He shared that he had never before been treated with such dignity, respect and love!

Craig had the dental work done the week of Thanksgiving.  He continues to improve thanks to SVdP and two volunteer caseworkers who looked at Craig in his time of great need and saw great possibilities.

As Craig apologized for his emotionality, he shared that sometimes the only way to really express appreciation for God’s love is through tears.
 
Resilience, Determination and Hope

 A Vincentian received a call from a member of the women’s guild at the parish.  She said,“Do you have a family that we could‘adopt’for Christmas?”After some reflection, she thought of a single mother with five children whom they had recently assisted.

The mother had been abused by her husband, who was now in jail. She asked only for help in paying her electric bill, but when the Vincentians visited, they found so much more need.  They noticed a family with a beautiful love and spirit. The caseworkers were impressed by their resilience, determination and hope.  The children were doing well in school and were very bright, which distracted attention from the tattered shoes they wore.

The SVdP Conference was able to pay their utility bill, and they reacted as if they had been given a new mansion to live in. When the caseworker called the mother to tell her of the offer from members of the women’s guild, she was grateful and started listing clothing sizes of her children.  They wanted more than clothing sizes. They wanted details like what were their favorite colors, what styles do they like?

The women’s guild was happy to get the list, but asked what the mother wanted.  The Vincentian told them that the mother had not asked for anything for herself.  They pressed for details and the caseworker mentioned that she liked books and she was a vegetarian.

We were overwhelmed by the generosity and the attention to detail shown by this group of women who reached out to a sister in need.  Each gift was carefully and beautifully wrapped.  And there were some unwrapped books, including vegetarian cook books. The gifts were delivered; the mother could not stop saying thank you!

This was so much more than materialistic gifts: it was the acknowledgement of love, sharing and appreciation.
 


From the SVdP Thrift Stores 

We went to a Walden’s Book Store that was closing to pick up the 2 bookcases we had purchased.  While we were there dismantling the cases, I asked the store manager if he could donate a couple more to the SVdP Thrift Store.  He said that we could have anything in the store that didn’t sell by noon but we had to have it out by 1p.m. and we would need to speak with mall management for instructions on how to remove the cases without going through the mall.

We went up to the mall offices and spoke with the mall manager explaining what we wanted to do.  We also asked if they had any other stores that were going out of business, would be willing to donate their equipment?  The manager told us that St. Vincent de Paul Society had helped him and his family in the past and he would be more than willing to give us a call if there were other vendors that might be willing to donate their equipment, surplus clothing, etc.

We received a call from him the next day telling us we could come and get the rest of the equipment in the bookstore.  We arranged to bring the rest of the equipment to our thrift store.  While we were getting the equipment I went across the mall to purchase water for everyone and explained to the cashier that we were getting the equipment for our SVdP Thrift Store.  She told us that SVdP had visited her and her family, and helped them with their utility bills and food.

I thought it was very special that of the 2 people we met at the mall both had been helped by St. Vincent de Paul Society.
 
Never Thought I Would Need Help 

Renee reached out to her local St. Vincent de Paul Conference when she got behind on her power bill. A senior citizen who lives on Social Security and Medicare, Renee, lives in a small condo.  Two Vincentians conducted a home visit and were able to provide the assistance she needed.

She wrote in response to her experience with SVdP:

I just want to drop you a note to say THANK you to St. Vincent de Paul and the local Conference for assisting me with my power bill.

It was the twelfth hour, and God came through for me through your ministry. I want to also thank the very nice lady (a volunteer called a Vincentian) who came with another to visit me and interview me. They both were so kind and understanding. As I told them as we talked, I never thought I would need a hand out, but God will humble us to show us where our help comes from.

The Vincentians were persistent in their attempts to contact me and I am still amazed at that! I know they are volunteers, and I tell you full time paid workers would not have done the same.

I believe volunteers are chosen by God. He knows our heart. Therefore, He touches the hearts of his chosen children to help others in need.

Again, thank you for your prayers and your caring spirit. May God continue to bless you.

–A grateful Client
 
Determined to Succeed 

Ashlee was pregnant and not married. Her teenage son and her father lived with her. Her father was having trouble finding work so he had to move in with her. Ashlee knew her income would be cut in half when she goes on maternity leave.  She called the SVdP assistance line and a volunteer called her back. She told the Vincentian that she needed help with her bills, food and clothing.  They made plans for a home visit.

When the Vincentians arrived at Ashlee’s home, they sat with her and talked a while. They learned that she had been taking classes to become an x-ray technician, but the pregnancy had made it impossible for her to continue. She hoped to go back after the baby was born.   The Vincentians told her about the SVdP food pantry and provided her a voucher for food and clothing.

She was able to receive food assistance and to apply for food stamps. She used the voucher for clothing at the local SVdP Thrift Store to get clothing for herself, her son and for the baby on the way. They also had a crib for her.

Ashlee said she never expected to get such considerate caring help. She was very grateful and will check in again after the baby is born to get information about ways for her to keep working, care for the new baby and finish her classes.    With her determination, we have no doubt she will make it work!
 
A Path Out of Difficult Times 

Ralph was spending most of his time looking for assistance and work. He lost his job in February. His health problems have made it difficult to find work. With the loss of his job, he also lost his health insurance.

After two trips to the emergency room, he still has limited physical capacity. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he turned to his local St. Vincent de Paul Conference for help. The Vincentians met with Ralph in his home. He told them he was behind in his rent, water and utilities. He was afraid that he would lose service. With the hot summer weather,  his electric bill was even higher than usual. His car had been repossessed so looking for work and assistance was difficult.

“I’ve been financially independent for 29 years and only held three jobs in throughout that time. This is the first time I find myself unable to pay my bills and take care of my family,” said Ralph.

The Vincentians listened to Ralph and told him they would do what they could to help.

A few days later, they called Ralph back with a plan. They told him they would help him pay his overdue rent and utilities.  But they also wanted to help him look for a job and find transportation. They offered to get him to the local career ministry, where he could get assistance in preparing a job search and network with others. They arranged for transportation to the meetings.

Ralph agreed to attend. They also told him that in the meantime, he could get food assistance from their food pantry and they were looking for a donated car for him.

Ralph has been attending the meetings and he is hopeful he will soon be working and providing for his own needs once again. He feels very grateful for the physical support from St. Vincent de Paul, but most of all he feels gratitude for the two Vincentians that offered him a path out of a very difficult time.
 
The Future Holds Brighter Days 

Even in the midst of the economic downturn, Helen has consistently been employed. However, life has brought other challenges that caused her to turn to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

Her cousin, Sarah’s husband died, leaving Sarah with two children under 8 years old.  Unfortunately, Sarah is disabled.  She has applied for Social Security disability, but has not received a response back yet.  Even in these tough times, Helen welcomed her cousin and her children into her home. But, the added expense, as well as the other expenses surrounding the death in the family, caused her to fall behind in her rent.  She had been working with the rental agency to keep up to date, until storms hit. Her household was affected by the tornadoes, creating more expenses which pushed her further behind.

She called SVdP and two Vincentians came to the house for a home visit. They sat with her and chatted. They looked around her home and saw, first hand, the damage done by the recent storms. They helped connect Helen with local agencies that could help her.

With help from St. Vincent de Paul, she will be able to begin repairs on her home and receive help to feed cousin and the children. She feels renewed and hopeful that the future holds brighter days.

Not Alone Anymore

 Margie’s husband had been in and out of work for the past year. They have an adopted son. They contacted St. Vincent de Paul for help with their power and gas bills. The hot summer had caused their usually manageable bills to sky rocketed. Margie contacted SVdP and two Vincentians went out to visit with Margie and her husband.

The Vincentians chatted with Margie and learned that they are trying to move to a smaller, less expensive apartment closer to their son’s school.

“There are so many expenses coming at us all at once and we can’t handle it alone. I can’t afford food, rent, electricity, gas, automobile’s gas, water, and sewage on my salary alone,” she told them.

Margie works at a minimum wage job putting in 50+ hours each week. She barely gets to see her family. They needed help with everything from food and rent to school supplies.

The St. Vincent de Paul Conference was able to offer Margie food from the food pantry. They screen her for other benefits and found she qualified for food assistance. Providing food made it easier for Margie to budget her meager income.  The Society helped her get caught up on her utility bills, too.

Margie hopes to move up to a supervisor’s position at work. The small increase in wages will help. She told the Vincentians that until she met them, her family felt like they were all alone; that nobody cared about them.

“We know we’re not alone anymore,” said Margie. “We are so grateful!”

At Rock Bottom

 Taylor had been working at a hospital but required major surgery in Oct ’08. After the surgery she never felt well. After many exhausting months of wondering, worrying and going to different doctors, she was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Unable to keep her hospital job, she lost health insurance, and eventually lost home.

For the past few years, she and her 6 year old son have moved, staying wherever she could find a place she could afford. When she reached out to St. Vincent de Paul, she said she was beyond exhausted and burned out.

Two Vincentians arrange to meet her at a local fast food restaurant. She told them that she was homeless and living on in her car with her son. Before her illness and job loss, they were a stable family. Until her unemployment benefits ran out she had paid utilities and rent wherever she stayed.

“But by the time I paid that and my bills, car insurance, medication, etc., I had nothing left to save,” she said.

Taylor told the Vincentians she was now completely homeless. She tried to find a shelter but the shelters either full, or not appropriate for a 6-year-old. She has no money left for gas. Taylor told them even she a found job now, she couldn’t get there, she can’t wash her clothes, shower, etc. She felt hopeless.

When the Vincentians heard Taylor’s story, they jumped into action. They contacted people in their community who could help Taylor find a place to live. The SVdP Conference was able to pay for a few months of rent. They provide her with a gas card and a voucher to the nearest SVdP Thrift Store. There she was able to purchase clean clothing, bedding and household items. Her son got a new pair of shoes!

Taylor settled into her new place. It was small, but clean and safe. The Vincentians helped her find a career care group who assisted her in preparing a resume and coached her on finding a job. She was able to get food from the local SVdP food pantry and reports that she is now employed. She would like a better job, but for now stability is very important to her son. She hopes to go to school to become a nurse.

Taylor was at rock bottom when she learned about St. Vincent de Paul. She says she will eternally grateful not only for the help but most of all for the compassion, caring and ongoing support she has received.

Broken, but Blessed

 Wilma reached out to St. Vincent de Paul through a posting on the SVdP Atlanta website, svdpatl.org.  She shared her story, requesting help.

St. Vincent de Paul responded by connecting Wilma with our client assistance line. When someone calls our help line, they are asked to punch in their zip code and they are directed to a voicemail box for the SVdP Conference in the same geographic location. Wilma followed the instructions and a Vincentian called her back.

Two caseworkers met with Wilma and learned that in June she had fallen and broke her ankle; she had been out of work since then.  She was struggling to pay her bills. She was behind on her power bill and rent. Her husband was unable to find work, too.  Since she had no supplemental insurance and her accident didn’t happen at work, there was no workers compensation or other financial assistance available. At the time, they had no income.

The SVdP Conference was able to assist with paying some of the bills. They also provided food and grocery cards. Wilma hoped to be well enough to go back to work soon.  Although it has been a rough time, she said she felt blessed to meet such wonderful people who are so willing to help.

You can help, too! When you donate to St. Vincent de Paul, you help families. Please give, today!
 
Filling the Gap
just a little help

 Billy was working part-time in a local supermarket, but his hours fluctuated according to the needs of the store. The unpredictable work hours made it difficult to pay his monthly bills. When his car broke down, the repair expenses totaled almost $800.  The added unexpected expense made him fall behind with this power, water and gas accounts. Also, he needed clothing and food assistance.

Through a referral he came to the St. Vincent de Paul Family Support Center. He was a little nervous about asking for assistance. He told us apologetically, he was used to taking care of himself. He said if he could just get a little help to fill in the gap between his income and the car repair bill, he would be able to do the rest on his own.

We were able to screen him for possible benefits and we learned he was eligible for other assistance. He was eligible for SNAP (food stamps). We gave him food to carry him until his new benefits kicked in. He received clothing and we paid his power bill.  Billy was relieved and grateful. He said being able to get food through SNAP would give him the financial cushion to meet his other obligations. Just a little help can make all the difference.

I thank God for Your Society

 My mother and I live in the same home, but the upstairs is mine and the downstairs is hers. She rents to me and my two young ones. I pay $300each month for all that. We have a running tab going on right now because I am in the middle of my Disability case that’s been taking a long time. The children’s father has not helped us at all since August 10, 2008. My kid’s will need uniforms when school starts and I have no idea what I’m going to do! I am disabled and until the Disability starts to pay (God will make it happen)-I have no income, period.

Please let me know if you have any programs or anything to help me until I’m on my feet. I am trying to start college online also, so I can find a career that I can physically do. I know from past experience that your society is blessed by God. You supplied Christmas presents for my children on Christmas Eve- it was such a surprise, and you were singing carols- it was so beautiful.

At other times you helped with a utility bill and much more. I thank God for your Society. I appreciate you and God Bless You All.
Truly,
A Friend in Need

 EDITOR’S NOTE: This person was referred to our client assistance line and received help from a local Conference. We, at St. Vincent de Paul are honored and blessed to have a small part in relieving the suffering of our neighbors in need. You can help, too. 
 
Grateful for Such Caring and Generous People
encouragement and help

 Sandra recently moved to Georgia from South Carolina, with her 3 children and their dad, for the promise of a better job. When she arrived, she was informed the position had become only a part-time job. The children’s dad left, saying he couldn’t handle it, and he moved back to SC, leaving her in Georgia to fend for herself, and their kids.

She called the St. Vincent de Paul assistance line and a Vincentian (volunteer caseworker/home visitor) called her back. They arranged for the Vincentian and her partner to visit where Sandra lived.  When they arrived, Sandra was surprised at how easy it was to talk to them. She poured out her heart to them and they listened and encouraged her.

The Vincentians told Sandra that they could help her. They gave her grocery gift cards and explained to her how to get to the local SVdP Food Pantry. Sandra asked for additional help with her rent. The home-visitors told her they could help her with direct aid, too. They shared information with her about the local career assistance program.

Sandra said she would attend the career assistance program. She told the Vincentians that she didn’t know where to turn for help until she found St. Vincent de Paul. The Vincentians assured her that they would help her and she told them she was very grateful to have found such caring and generous people in her new home.
 
She Had Nearly Given Up Hope
trying to hold on

 Martha, a divorced mother of two, was working as hospice practical nurse. She owned her own car and rented a trailer where she lived with her high school aged daughter, her adult son and a roommate. The roommate had agreed to pay half of the rent, but left without paying for the second month. When she couldn’t pay the rent, she contacted St. Vincent de Paul for help.

The home-visitors that came to see Martha and assess her situation learned that Martha’s son was recently divorced and a large portion of his monthly salary was going for child support. This left very little to live on. He did help with small bills and some groceries.

They also learned that Martha owed back taxes. She was having trouble making ends meet with rent, utilities and food bills.  Martha needed to see a doctor to have her bridgework repaired. She keeps her home very neat and clean and really seems to be trying every possible way to meet her obligations. She did have a washer but no dryer.

The pair that visited her told her how to apply for food stamps and suggested that unless they found a way to earn more income, her struggles would continue. Martha explained that in just a few months she would be 62 and would become eligible for Social Security, she felt they should be in better shape at that time. Since it was only a few months until then, they agreed to assist with her rent payments. Martha told the Vincentians that her teenage daughter was looking for an after school job. She hoped that her additional income would help them until she could receive her Social Security benefits.

As Martha walked them to the door, tears welled in her eyes. She was so relieved and grateful. She had nearly given up hope. But the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, through the generous service of the two volunteer home-visitors, had restored not only her hope, but a little bit of her faith, too.
 
In a Time of Great Need
advice and comfort

 Toni drives a school bus but her salary was recently cut due to the economic challenges of the school system. Even though her husband is employed at a big box discount store, they had fallen behind in their rent.  Since Toni was the primary breadwinner, losing even a small amount of her salary had a huge impact on the family’s ability to pay rent and utilities, especially since they have four children to clothe and feed.

Toni called the St. Vincent de Paul assistance line and a home-visitor called her back. Two Vincentians came to Toni’s apartment to learn more about her, and her family’s situation.  They offered to assist her in seeking other sources of aid, discussed how to re-evaluate priorities and reallocate resources. They encouraged her to be patient.

The Vincentians gave Toni food pantry coupons and promised to help with utilities. By paying for Toni’s utilities, the funds which would normally go there could be reallocated to pay the rent. Just having someone listen and offer advice was a great comfort to Toni. The SVdP Conference was able to assist her in a time of great need.
 
Always Look for the Helpers
that’s where you will find God

 We have all been shocked and stunned by the destruction caused by so many tornadoes this spring.  Right here in Georgia, homes and lives have been destroyed in Meriwether and Pickens counties. People are so stunned by what has happened, they don’t even know where to begin looking for help.

In LaGrange, a lady living in a mobile home heard the tornado sirens and evacuated her home. She started across the field to her landlord’s house. Halfway across the wind knocked her down and she sprained her ankle. She never made it to the landlord’s home. And that was a good thing because his home was totally destroyed by the storm.  Both people looked to St. Vincent de Paul for help.

Girl Scout Troop 576 from Conyers, Georgia used 10 percent of their Cookie Sale funds to help the victims of the recent tornadoes in Georgia. The Cadette Scouts, girls ages 12-13, decided they wanted to help the victims of the recent tornadoes. They shopped together and spent $150 selecting items they felt would be most helpful to people who had lost everything in the storms. The troop leaders, Karen Sherwood and Rita Pikor, brought the car load of goods to the Family Support Center Chamblee. The goods were given to the St. Peter SVdP Conference in LaGrange.

In Pickens County more than 38 percent of the population already lives below the poverty level.  Many live in the most affordable housing– mobile homes.   Because so many people rent their homes, nearly 70 percent are not insured. At least 121 homes were completely destroyed by this tornado. Other homes have been turned over on their sides. The winds snapped off trees 10 feet above the ground. The windows were blown out of many of the homes still standing. The victims of the tornado don’t know where to turn for help. They are in shock and afraid to leave their ruined homes because they fear losing the few belongings they still possess. They are afraid of possible looting.  Although many reputable agencies are working in the area, people are hesitant to ask for help.

The SVdP Conferences in Pickens County have mobilized their caseworkers to hit the streets to spread the word that they are there, ready to help in any way possible.  They have driven to the stricken areas and handed out their cards so folks can contact them when they are ready. They have already paid for a number of victims’ rent and utilities. The Vincentians are collaborating with FEMA, GEMA, the Red Cross, Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army.

Sometimes catastrophic events like this create even more fear and distrust. But the late TV star, Fred Rogers, once said “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”Where you see helpers, that’s where you will find God.

God is indeed working to help the affected people.  Along with the Girl Scout mentioned above, members of SVdP St. Monica Conference sent more than $250 in donations for tornado relief. Donations have come through the SVdP website, a Dunwoody High School football team collected personal care products to donate and we have even received help from a Conference in Arizona.

Longtime Vincentian, Jim VanWinkle, lives part of the year in Fountain Hills, Arizona. Always interested in helping people in need, Jim plugged right into the SVdP Conference at the Church of the Ascension. When they heard about the situation in Jim’s hometown in Pickens County, they felt a responsibility to help those in greatest need. The SVdP Conference at the Church of the Ascension sent $1,000 to help.

Like the shocked and stunned people working their way through this latest catastrophe, we, too are shocked and stunned. But, mostly, we are humbled and blessed. We feel blessed by the outpouring of generosity and we are humbled by the tireless love that moves our Vincentians, wherever they reside, to be the face of hope to people in their greatest hour of need.  Always look for the helpers, there you will see God!
 
Close to the Edge
helping, inspiring and making a difference

 When local homecare provider’s social worker called to request more brochures about St. Vincent de Paul, we were pleased to hear how much she values and respects what we do.

The social worker was very impressed and inspired by the way our Vincentians care for the clients she had sent to them.  She shared the story of a young family who had fallen behind on their rent payments.

Sharon and David were also caring for a sick child and when they came home from a doctor visit, they found all of their belonging sitting in the yard – soaking wet because it had begun to rain. Everything they owned was ruined!

They contacted the social worker who connected them with SVdP’s helpline. They called the help number and two Vincentians met them at a local fast food restaurant.  The family told them how difficult it had been lately. Although both the mom and dad were working, their child’s illness had severely impacted the number of hours they could put in. They fell behind in their rent because they had to pay doctor bills and buy food and medicine.  Their landlord had been patient for a while, but he decided he couldn’t wait any longer.

The Vincentians told Sharon and David about SVdP, sharing that they could go through a screening process for benefits available for the working poor.  They helped provided Sharon and David find a new place to live and funding to pay for their child’s medication.

After Sharon and David moved into their new place, the Vincentians gave them a voucher to get clothing, furniture and household items from the local SVdP Thrift Store. Sharon and David were very grateful. They both had always worked and had never asked for any kind of help before.

The boost that SVdP gave them, help them to get back on track. Their child was feeling better and they both were able to resume their work schedules.

The social worker said we sometimes don’t realize how close to the edge people live.  The working poor live paycheck-to-paycheck and a very small amount of adversity can cause a huge disruption in their financial stability.  She was amazed and grateful for SVdP’s presence in her community.  We are pleased and grateful to know that we are helping, inspiring and making a difference.
 
He’d Rather Be Earning a Living
grateful for the great care

 Jason is permanently disabled and is in constant pain. He was injured while on the job when he accidentally fell down a flight of stairs. As a result, he has qualified for social security disability and can no longer work. His wife lost her job, but they had been living on her unemployment payments. She no longer receives unemployment.  They have two sons living with them.

Jason’s condition causes a great deal of pain and he takes prescribed pain medication. He has to pay for his prescription and doctors visits with his disability money. This leaves very little for him and his wife to live on. It’s putting a financial strain on the family. Sometimes they have to decide which bills to pay and which will have to wait because they need the money for food. The family was referred to the Chamblee Family Support Center by the local SVdP Conference.

Jason and his wife came in together. It was along arduous journey just to get to the FSC. When they arrived they were warmly greeted and treated with respect and kindness. After taking their information and screening them for other possible relief benefits, the FSC was able to provide the family with 110 lbs of food from the food pantry. The caseworker packed it carefully so it would be easy for them to transport.  Jason said that he would much rather be earning a living, but he was grateful for the great care and concern her received from SVdP.
 
From the Heart
giving so others have hope

 Girl Scout Troop 576 from Conyers, Georgia used 10 percent of their Cookie Sale funds to help the victims of the recent tornado sin Georgia.

The Cadet Scouts, girls ages 12-13, decided they wanted to help the victims of the recent tornadoes.
They shopped together and spent $150 selecting items they felt would be most helpful to people who had lost everything in the storms. The troop leaders, Karen Sherwood and Rita Pikor, brought the car load of goods to the Family Support Center Chamblee. The goods will be given to a SVdP Conference in an area that experienced the destruction brought on by the tornadoes.

The troop leaders found St. Vincent de Paul through the web at www.svdpatl.org . Sherwood attends St. Pius X Catholic Church in Conyers; the girls go to Cousins Middle School and Liberty Middle School.
We are grateful for these fine young women and we thank them for their effort to support and aid their community in a time of need and devastation. They were truly giving from the heart!
 
Putting Lives Back Together
hope rising from the ashes

 Sheyla came to the St. Vincent de Paul Family Support Center  because her apartment burned down. While she was out of town visiting her mother, the apartment complex she lived in with her daughter and two grandchildren burned to the ground. Through no fault of their own, they had nowhere to go. They came in to the FSC with only the clothes on their backs. They lost absolutely everything and had to start over again.

They needed food, clothing, hygiene products, furniture and household items. SVdP provided Sheyla and her family with sofas, chairs, clothing, shoes, linen and 70 lbs of food.  She said she felt blessed to just have clean clothing to wear. She said the help we gave will give them the jump -start to get back on their feet. The generosity of our donors made it possible to help Sheyla and her family put their lives back together after this difficult time.
 
Making a Difference
hope restored

 Clara seemed exhausted when the two St. Vincent de Paul volunteer caseworkers stopped at her apartment. With two children under the age of three and working to support them, she didn’t have much time to rest.

The caseworkers talked with Clara about her situation.  She told the caseworkers that even with working, she couldn’t earn enough to pay her bills.  The home Clara had been able to make was clean, but sparsely furnished. The caseworkers learned that she had fled an abusive situation and was working hard to start over.   They reassured her and suggested she look for a better paying job.  In the meantime, they gave her grocery and gasoline gift cards. They told her about the closest SVdP food pantry and the local jobs network.

Tears welled in Clara’s eyes as she walked the caseworkers to the door. She had felt so helpless and alone, but the visit had restored some of her faith.  She promised to stay in touch and the caseworkers did the same.

A few weeks later Clara called the SVdP caseworkers.  She told them about attending the jobs network. She had found a better job, making more money.  She was so excited and grateful.  Her enthusiasm inspired her caseworkers, too.  Whenever we reach out in the spirit of love and charity, the givers, as well as the receivers, benefit.  Helping people just feels good.

You can feel good, too. Volunteer with SVdP, donate household goods or write a check.  You can make a difference.
 
Warming a Heart
offering hope

 On a slow Friday afternoon, Richard walked into the SVdP Conference Support Center and into our lives. The weather had turned cold and he needed to warm up.  After chatting with Richard, we learned he was homeless.   Even though we were not ‘officially’ open, we offered him an emergency bag of food and some bread.  All of the St. Vincent de Paul Family Support Centers have free bread available every day.  Anyone can come in and take bread with no questions asked.

We noticed that that Richard wasn’t really dressed to withstand the colder weather.  One of our workers went into the Clothing Voucher are and found a warm jacket with a hood. She gave it to Richard and he was visibly moved by this act of kindness. He put on the jacket and finally began to warm up.  We told him how to contact United Way for homelessness assistance.

Richard walked out of lives that afternoon with some food to eat and clothing to keep warm. We like to think we warmed his heart a little, too.   When you help SVdP achieve our mission, you directly impact people who live and struggle in your own community.
 


 A Much Better Future

Rafael came to the St. Vincent de Paul Family Support Center looking for help to pay his rent.  At first, we wondered why a 17-year-old needed rent assistance. Raphael’s story unfolded.

He had left his family home because of physical abuse, petitioned the court and was granted the status of an emancipated minor.  He found a place to live and a job. He was even attending GED classes in hopes of getting a better paying job. His father was unhappy that Raphael was leaving and beat him severely. He was hospitalized and required surgery.  After the surgery to repair his injuries, he needed help; so he moved in with his mother.

As Raphael’s living situation continued to create stress for him, he wondered how he could move back into his apartment. While he was recuperating from his hospital stay, he had not been able to work.  He needed help paying the rent. A friend suggested he contact SVdP.

The SVdP caseworker screened Raphael for benefits and found he qualified for food stamps and rent assistance. It was great to see the light return to his eyes as the smile crept across his face. He looked so much more like a typical 17-year-old should look.

This young man, at 17, had endured more than many adults, yet he persevered.  Recently, we learned he had completed his GED classes and had passed the exam. He was grateful for the help he received from SVdP and was looking forward to a much better future.


 


Turning the Heat Back On 

Winter has passed in Atlanta and temperate springtime climes have returned. But none of us can forget the unusually cold season that brought unexpected levels of snow and the massively disruptive ice storm that shut the city down. Challenges – and bitingly cold temperatures – came everyone’s way. It’s difficult to consider how much more challenging the frigid experience would have been with no heat.

Consider a recent St. Vincent de Paul client faced the cold, ice and most of the season with his gas turned off. And with insufficient income, “Mr. B.,” an 80-year-old renter, had little hope of changing his uncomfortable situation. As temperatures dropped, he resorted to opening up his oven door and twisting the knob to get relief. He realized he needed to reach out to someone. That reaching out came in a series of phone calls that led him to the Sacred Heart Conference of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.

A pair of Society volunteers, called Vincentians, arranged to meet him on a Saturday afternoon; but the arctic blasts that pummeled the region in January made even that meeting difficult. The scheduled get-together took place on the weekend following Atlanta’s “Snowpocalypse,” the weeklong ice and snow event. Because the client’s apartment was on a high slope with a driveway covered by ice, visitors could not easily get inside. Improvisation was in order, and the client gingerly made his way down his hill to meet Vincentian volunteers in their car.

In a soft voice, from the back seat, he described his grim situation. Problems started the previous winter when he’d fallen behind on his gas bill. Eventually, the utility turned his gas off. During his working days, Mr. B. worked in the maintenance department of the Georgia Tech Research Institute. As a retiree, he survived on a small Social Security pension. His lifestyle was very modest, but utilities and other expenses continually exhausted his resources. After hearing Mr. B.’s story, caseworkers knew he was a good candidate to receive support.

A nearly $400 delinquent bill had to be paid before the gas could be turned back on. Another in-town charity committed to pay half of the large bill, but the gap for the total amount needed to be closed. Based on the Vincentian’s report, the Sacred Heart conference agreed to help with the remainder.  Mr. B. did his part, traveling to the other charity via MARTA to secure that charity’s portion. A caseworker called to monitor Mr. B’s progress. There were a series of conference calls with customer service representatives from the utility company. Even when both checks were sent, there were still roadblocks as inevitable bureaucratic issues cropped up. The utility company needed an application and a credit check in order to restore service. A hastily brokered “pre-pay” route turned out to be the best solution. After two weeks of wrangling and plenty of Vincentian persistence, Mr. B. was on the cusp of having a warm apartment. The last step was prompting the landlord to fix a long-dormant furnace. After that final hurdle, the furnace lit up and – finally! – Mr. B. had heat!

The SVdP caseworker followed up and connected the client to a community service agency which provides heat assistance to the low-income elderly. At last check, Mr. B is considering a part-time job that will let him better make ends meet. During all follow-up calls, he continually mentions his appreciation for SVdP’s support.

A Brand New Roof

collaboration 

Recently, St. Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP) in Greensboro received a call from a client asking for assistance to provide firewood to heat his home heat for the cold winter. The SVdP caseworkers made a home visit to discover two rooms were badly damaged from a storm. The client’s roof was rotted through and rain was coming into the house in several areas.

The client’s situation was beyond the financial capability of SVdP. But the SVdP volunteers didn’t give up. Instead, they called several roofing companies in the area to ask for assistance like a discount, or a deal on shingles, or something else. Of the many companies they called, only Complete Roofing Systems responded, agreeing to inspect the leaking roof for free.

After the initial, Complete Roofing Systems, Inc. called SVdP and said they would do the whole job as a charity donation. This included tearing off the old roof, replacing the rotted plywood base, tar paper, shingles and job-site clean-up. The whole job was completed in less than one day–on Valentine’s Day! The client was ecstatic and so thankful to have a leak-free house.

Our volunteer caseworkers realize that the financial problems facing the unemployed, disabled, and elderly cannot be solved by a single visit from a caseworker. Our caseworkers, as illustrated by this story, collaborate with other companies, government agencies, and outreach groups to understand the client needs and develop an approach to empower our clients to achieve self-sufficiency.

This is just one example how SVdP helps the needy and suffering in Lake, Greene, Putnam and Hancock counties. SVdP has been active in the area since 2001, providing emergency financial assistance, food, furniture, minor home repairs, education, and spiritual support to those in need regardless of background or faith.

Complete Roofing Systems, Inc., owned by John Tanner, III (President), and Chad Conley (Executive VP), started its operation initially in Cherokee County. Their focus on the customer has allowed them to successfully expand their operations throughout the state of Georgia. Their team members are passionate about actively participating in the community.  By maintaining positive involvement in local communities, they aim to be a company that makes a difference.
 
Three Generations

meaningful life 

Janice came to the attention of St. Vincent de Paul a few years ago when she applied to and was accepted into a comprehensive skills and education program. At age 26, she and her husband, Eric, were struggling to pay their bills. They had no system, no budget and no plan. Eric worked as a contractor and Janice work minimum wage jobs. They needed a better way to live.

Two Vincentians were assigned to Janice’s case. They mentored and guided her over the next two years.  Janice began an education program to become a surgical technician. She focused on her studies and worked part time waiting tables, all the while excelling in every class she took.

To ease the couple’s burden, SVdP paid several mortgage, car insurance and utility payments.  School was covered by Pell Grants and the HOPE Scholarship. The caseworkers helped Janice and Eric learn budgeting principles and discipline.  The Vincentians served as mentors and guides.

Janice graduated with honors and began working for an oral surgeon.  She loved the work but it was only a part time position.  Just a few months ago, she found a fulltime job with a local Urologist.  She and her husband are much more financially stable and they know how to manage their household. They volunteer with SVdP, too.

While Janice was going through the two-year program, her parents decided to get involved with the local SVdP Conference that was helping her.  Fran and Ron wanted to help others like their daughter as repayment for all the help Janice had received. They are active Vincentians who volunteer in the Thrift Store even though Fran suffers from a debilitating bone disease that confines her to a wheelchair.

When Janice’s grandparents moved to the area, they became involved with SVdP, too! At ages 80 and 82, Sally and Frank are active volunteers who do whatever they can to assist clients in need.  This family is a wonderful testament to the SVdP mission. Three generations offering hope and working to empower others to self-sufficiency
 
Hope Delivered 

Daniel’s Story

As Daniel tried to fall asleep in the homeless shelter, he couldn’t turn off his mind. How did he end up here after overcoming so many obstacles in his life?

As a child, Daniel had survived the vilest abuse at the hands of his own parents. Somehow he fought his way out of the abusive family situation and grew up with ambition and goals.  He obtained an education that allowed him a successful career.  He fell in love with a wonderful woman, a registered nurse.

They built a good life together. It was more than achieving the American Dream. Although they never were blessed with children, over the years they acquired cars, boats and more than 12 rental homes. They were living the good life until his wife was diagnosed with Cancer. She went through Cancer treatments three times before she succumbed. During the battle of their lives, Daniel was diagnosed with debilitating bone disease.
Daniel transferred to Atlanta with hope of starting new. He valiantly worked to pay the medical bills, but they were daunting. He began selling his assets. The cars and boats went first. Then the he sold the rental property. There still was not enough money to pay the medical bills. He sold his home.
Homeless and broke he ended up in the homeless shelter in Paulding County, where each night he tried to sleep. They fed him, washed his clothes and provided a safe place to sleep.  His bone disease had made mobility difficult and Daniel relied on an electric wheelchair to get around.

Daniel finally fell asleep.

While surfing the Web one day, Daniel found help. Some folks got him into a shotgun house but it was in a tough neighborhood. They helped him apply for disability and food stamps, but he was barely making the rent. He was becoming more and more depressed. He heard about St. Vincent de Paul and called the assistance line. An  SVdP volunteer called Daniel to tell him he and his wife would be coming to his house for a visit to see what he needed. When the couple (caseworkers called Vincentians) arrived, they noticed the run down condition of the rental home, the sketchy neighborhood, the lack of furnishings, but most importantly, they noticed how depressed Daniel seemed.

They talked for a long time. Daniel opened his heart and shared many of the gory details of his fall from self-sufficiency.  By the time the Vincentians left, he was feeling like there might still be hope. Hope for a better living situation and also hope for a connection with caring people.

The Vincentians talked about Daniel and his situation. They knew he needed to live in a safer neighborhood. They found him a less expensive rental in a safer area. SVdP paid his rent and utilities. Once Daniel moved, the Vincentians made it a point to check on him daily. They knew he had a serious medical condition, a debilitating bone disease, and they worried about him. They also wanted to help him achieve a better quality of life.

The Vincentians became Daniel’s friends. The couple would visit him; drive him to the grocery store and doctor’s appointments. His health improved and Daniel was able to get out of the wheel chair to walk with the aid of a walker. The increased mobility buoyed his spirit. Eventually he was able and well enough to purchase and drive a handicap-equipped van.

Even after so much improvement, the Vincentian couple still stayed in touch with Daniel.  Daniel called the couple his special angels. One time Daniel told them how the care they had shown him made him understand, a little, what it would have been like to have loving parents rather than the abusive parents he grew up with. In a way these three people became a family.

Sadly, Daniel’s health deteriorated and he passed away. The Vincentians had discussed this eventual possibility with him and they had planned to help him draw up a formal will.  His wish was to donate everything he had to SVdP. He was so grateful.  The Vincentians learned that Daniel had a paid up life insurance policy which he had planned to assign to SVdP, but he died before the paperwork could be filed. SVdP did receive Daniel’s van and was able to use it to help another person, a disabled parishioner.

Daniel left an indelible mark on the two Vincentians and the SVdP Conference they serve. Sometimes people end up in these dire situations through no fault of their own.  Daniel lost everything he had worked for in order to pay his wife’s medical bills.

The two Vincentians say as much as they helped Daniel, he also helped them. He gave them purpose and meaning. What a blessing it was for SVdP to know him and help him. And what a blessing Daniel was to the person who received his van.  Good begets good, blessing brings blessing, hope feeds hope…and then there is always love.
 
 Help and Encouragement Empower Change

He was terribly thin and gaunt. He greeted us in the lobby of the high- rise building and took us to a new apartment that was empty except for a folding chair and a pillow. We wondered why “Mr. J” was there. Why would he be in such a new apartment and be asking for help with his rent? He obviously had not been at this address for a long time; how was it possible that he was behind on the rent already?

Mr. J. spoke quietly with a prominent accent. He told us that he was originally from Poland and had been working at a new downtown hotel as a maintenance engineer. Encouraged by the income that came from a respectable new job; he paid the fees and first two month’s rent and moved into his new apartment. But things did not stay stable for long. He arrived one day at his new job with beer on his breath. The breach of employment protocol was immediate cause for dismissal. Mr. J. found himself in an empty apartment, behind in rent, and with no one to turn to for help. He called the United Way and that agency referred him to the St. Vincent de Paul.

With some diplomacy, the visiting caseworkers asked an obvious question: “Mr. J, do you have a problem with alcohol?” In response, the man admitted he did have a problem. He had been sober for years and had a general handle on the addictions that had brought him low in the past. But in recent times, while working as a waiter, his employer was instructing the staff on wines of the restaurant. With the other waiters, as part of the tasting course, he imbibed the wine. That was all it took. He was off his wagon and was drinking from then on. He was thin the day the caseworkers met him. It seemed obvious that there had been more drinking than eating in his life.

The Sacred Heart Conference was able to help. To covering his apartment rent was impractical because his rent was too high and he had no income. Under counsel from the caseworker, Mr. J. obtained a more affordable rent arrangement that he found through a friend. But since the heart of Mr. J’s problem was a drinking problem, the case worker extracted a promise: Conference help would be forthcoming, but Mr. J. needed to do something as well. The caseworker urged AA meetings and Mr. J. agreed he would attend. Meanwhile, he had a tough time finding a new job. To help, the conference extended rental assistance his way, and also covered the costs for a MARTA card that would be valuable for the job search.

Despite his best intentions, a drinking problem was not so easily routed. The caseworker learned – from a former roommate of Mr. J.’s – the client had been drinking again. With the client’s betterment in mind, the caseworker again confronted the situation. During this stage of a needed intervention, Mr. J. conceded he needed to finally get his drinking problem under control. If left unchecked, his problems would result in a downward spiral to the streets.

A few days later, Mr. J called to say that he was checking into a Detox Clinic. He needed a place to store his things in the interim. He also needed rental assistance for the boarding house where he’d stay while he got counseling. In both cases the conference was able to step in and help. The counseling center required psychological and physical exams. The conference caseworker lobbied for Mr. J. and assured the director that the client was a worthy candidate for the program. It was in the program that the client finally was able to turn the corner on his addictions. Just before Christmas 2010, Mr. J. called the caseworker with wonderful news. He was doing well. He was clean and sober. Further, he wanted to report that he had a new job at a downtown hotel where he was working yet again as a maintenance engineer for a downtown hotel. The caseworker congratulated Mr. J., and then saw to it that more support was directed his way in the form of MARTA cards.
It took strength for Mr. J to pull himself out of the grip of alcoholism; the Sacred Heart Conference of St. Vincent de Paul was glad to be a witness and to provide help and encouragement on behalf of the people of Sacred Heart Parish. Pray with us that Christ continues to be the source of Mr. J’s strength and that he progresses steadily in his new life.

Standing on Her Own 

Helen was laid off from her job at the bank after working there for three years.  Although she was receiving unemployment insurance and food stamps, she and her two boys were facing eviction.  She didn’t receive child support from their dad but had been making ends meet by doing temporary jobs when possible.  She was about to start working for a cell phone service provider earning more than minimum wage.  Occasionally, her mother helps her pay bills.

After contacting St. Vincent de Paul, she found assistance with her rent. SVdP paid her back rent and carried her over a rough spot until she could stand on her own. This allowed her to keep her family in their familiar surroundings. She started her new job without any worries about where she and her boys would live. She has been successful with the new job and is standing on her own.
 


From Client to Customer 

A volunteer in one of St. Vincent de Paul’s Thrift Stores noticed the same women came to shop on a regular basis. She struck up a conversation with her and learned her name was Jewel. She told the volunteer that she was managing on a very meager income, so shopping at the SVdP Thrift Store seemed to make a lot of sense. But, she also remembered SVdP from her youth in South Africa.

When she was a child, her family struggled for food, clothing and housing. They found help and hope with the local SVdP Conference. Jewel remembered how SVdP had always been there to help her family. When she grew up and came to the United States, she decided that her success would not make her forget where she came from and who had helped her. Each place she has lived, she has looked for the local SVdP Thrift Store. This time she was at the store in Lilburn in Georgia.

Jewel, who as a child experienced the struggle with poverty, lives a self-sufficient life, thanks in part, to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul
 
 Uplifted

Sandra Hughes was raised in a large family with five siblings. She started her first job at a poultry farm at age 12. With no money for college after graduating high school, she struggled as a waitress, hoping that one day she would be able to go back to school and do something with her life.

By January of 2008, she was a single mom with three children to feed and clothe. It was then that she decided to take that first step toward making a better future for herself and her children. She walked into Appalachian Technical College (now Chattahoochee Technical College) not knowing what she really wanted to do, or where to start. The admissions office was very helpful. She took an assessment test called Career Scope that helped her decide which program to enroll in.

With help from the financial aid department at the college and the people at St. Vincent de Paul’s ‘Family Uplift’ program, she was able to go to school full time. Working her way through school as a work study student for the Registrar’s office and then for the campus Library, I she was well on her way.  Then in March, as she was looking at the college Web site, she noticed that there were a few job openings at the Jasper campus. She jumped at the opportunity to work on campus and quickly sent her application and resume in for two of the positions that were offered.

Today, she is a full time employee at Chattahoochee Technical College and has just received her Associate’s Degree in Accounting. She has come a long way in two short years; however, her journey would have been far more difficult without the love and support she received from the ‘Family Uplift’ Program at St. Vincent de Paul.
