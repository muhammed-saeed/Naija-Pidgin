 Extremely poor service. Now, I always check my orders when I get fast food. I checked all my sides, but I thought, nah, any dingus can manage to count 10 pieces of chicken into a bucket. Apparently, not so much. Now, mistakes happen. I am never a jerk with the fast food folks, they have a somewhat stressful job, trying to manage custom orders and keep up with a busy drive through, but then, calling to correct the order, the manager, yes, the manager, chooses to be obnoxious about whether or not they screwed up. It wasn&apos;t even like we said,&quot;Hey, jerk, ya screwed up my food!&quot;Merely a little,&quot;Hey, uh, we&apos;re missing half of our chicken, can you fix that so the whole family can eat?&quot;Hell, I was a pizza guy.

 For more than 60 years, this all-American institution has been serving its signature chicken and home-style sides.. In Short 
Established in 1939, this fast-food restaurant still makes its legendary fried chicken with the closely guarded blend of 11 herbs and spices originally created by founder Colonel Sanders. Modern additions to the menu include oven-roasted renditions of its chicken sandwiches, popcorn chicken, potato wedges and wraps. Classic sides include flaky, oversized biscuits, steaming-hot mashed potatoes and gravy, smoky-sweet baked beans and crisp, generously dressed coleslaw. Kids and adults love the &quot;little bucket&quot; parfaits of pudding desserts. …
