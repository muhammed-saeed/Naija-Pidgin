		Sowing the seeds of communication 
Welcome to a new source of information and communication within Miracle Restaurant Group. This pages will offer you links to information you use daily and provide a means of communicating with your fellow managers. At Miracle Restaurant Group, we strive to use technology efficiently as a means to improve our business and the operation of your restaurants, but what we truly hope to gain is a greater means of support and to leverage the power of friends, colleagues and business partners.

 Our Mission is to become the fast food restaurant of choice for our guests, by first becoming the fast food employer of choice for our employees. To benefit both by sharing the blessings we receive and always remembering to give back to the communities that we do business in.

 Our Vision 
To become the preeminent franchisee of Arby&apos;s by owning and operating 65 profitable restaurants by 2010.
