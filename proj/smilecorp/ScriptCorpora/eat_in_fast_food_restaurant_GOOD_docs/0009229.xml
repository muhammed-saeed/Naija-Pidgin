CHAPTER 5

ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS

1 DEFINITIONS
Accounting systems Tasks and records by which transactions are processed to
maintain financial records.
Internal control system Environment and procedures to ensure efficient conduct
of the business, safeguarding assets, prevention and detection of
fraud and error, accuracy and completeness of accounting
records and timely preparation of financial information.

2 DOCUMENTING THE ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
An auditor must understand the accounting system that is being audited and therefore
must document the system fully. This can be done via:
•narrative notes–written explanation of the system and controls within it
Documentation
techniques
Objectives of controls
Types of control
Business Transaction cycles
Reports to directors/management (SAS 610)
•flowcharts–diagrammatic representation outlining the sequence of events in a
system showing document flow and the department or function responsible for
each event
•internal control questionnaire (ICQ)–checklist of questions designed to discover
the existence of internal controls and the possible weaknesses within them. A‘yes’
answer to a question indicates a strength and a‘no’indicates a weakness. (Are all
purchases&gt;£1000 authorised?).
•internal control evaluation (ICE)–similar to an ICQ but contains only key control
questions
•walkthrough tests–these involve tracing a transaction from beginning to end
through the accounting system. This ensures the auditor has correctly understood
how the system works.

2.1 EXERCISE 1
Compare and contrast narrative notes, flowcharts and questionnaires as a method of
documenting the accounting system.

2.2 SOLUTION 1
Narrative notes Flowcharts Questionnaires

3 INTERNAL CONTROLS

3.1 OBJECTIVES OF CONTROLS
Internal controls strive to ensure that:
•C -all transactions are complete
•A -all transactions are accurate
•V -all transactions are valid
•E -recorded assets exist.

3.2 TYPES OF CONTROLS
Control environment (overall attitude and management) cover the:
•philosophy and operating style of management
•internal audit function
•segregation of duties
•supervision of work.

Control procedures (to achieve specific objectives) consist of:
•P -physical access to assets and records are limited
•A -approval and control of documents
•C -controls over computerised applications
•A -checking of arithmetical accuracy of records
•M -maintaining and reviewing control accounts and trial balances
•A -performing accounting reconciliations
•C -comparing records with physical counts and internal data with external data.

3.3 EXERCISE 2

5 AUDIT APPROACH
As far as the audit is concerned as well as fully understanding the accounting system
and the controls contained therein an auditor may well be able to reduce the amount
of substantive testing they do if the controls in place within a company’s accounting
system are accurate and efficient. In order to decide whether internal controls exist
and can be relied upon the controls must be tested.

5.1 TESTS OF CONTROL
•Enquiries and observations collaborating the internal control function
•Inspect a document to evidence control has operated (e.g. authorised purchase
order)
•Examination of evidence of management reviews (e.g. board minutes)
•Reperformance of control procedures (e.g. control account reconciliations)
However, substantive testing cannot be eliminated entirely due to the inherent
limitations present in internal controls. These are:
•The potential of human error
•The possibility of circumvention of a control via collusion
•The possibility of management overriding the control
•Changes over time making the control inadequate
•The cost of the control outweighing the benefit
•Controls only picking up routine transactions, so that other transactions go
undetected.

6 REPORTS TO DIRECTORS OR MANAGEMENT (SAS 610)
At the completion of the audit auditors usually send a report to directors or
management to communicate points that have come to their attention during the audit.
A management letter is not compulsory but it often“adds value”to the audit process.

6.1 CONTENTS
•Material weaknesses in the accounting and internal control system
•Implications of the weakness
•Consequences of the weakness
•Unsuitable accounting policies
•Non compliance with SSAPs/legislation.

6.2 PROCEDURES
•State that the letter is not a comprehensive statement of all weaknesses
•Write it as soon as possible after completion of audit (maximises effectiveness)
•Ask for a reply to points made
•If significant matters raised in previous letters have not been addressed, ask why
•Address it to a person having authority to act (usually board of directors)
•State that the letter is a confidential communication, not for use by third parties

6.3 EXERCISE 3
You are the auditor of Devarim Ltd, a paper merchants in Swindon. You spend some
time in the office and observe the following. Milo the office junior completed a
purchase requisition for a new computer. He phoned PC world and placed the order
himself. He then completed a purchase order form and sent it to the warehouse to
inform them of the computer’s impending arrival. Draft the appropriate sections of the
management letter.
