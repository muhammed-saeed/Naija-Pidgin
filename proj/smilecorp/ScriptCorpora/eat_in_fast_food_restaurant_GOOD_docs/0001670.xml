This is the one and only Sonic Drive-In I&apos;ve ever been to.  Growing up in Hawaii we&apos;re teased with the commercials but never allowed to enjoy because the closest one was always 2,500 miles away!

But as my rating reflects, I have yet to be impressed by Sonics.  Tater tots have always been on the soggy side.  Wet (water) soggy not oily soggy.  The grilled cheese sandwiches are yum when you&apos;re starving but as a snack you&apos;ll think to yourself that your little brother can make you a better one.  I did try a New York dog and I really did like that.  Next time I&apos;m going to get a Chicago dog, that was my first pick but my indecisiveness got the best of me.

And what is Sonics known for?  Their drinks, right?  Well my first time ever making it there I had a real strawberry and vanilla slush.  Heaven.  Every time after that they&apos;ve been out of vanilla.  Bah.

What I do enjoy other than the New York dog is all the lavender plants that surround the property, it smells AMAZING!  So I have hope for Sonics but  I know hope can only take us so far.  Someone needs to change it up and I am not about to lower my expectations anytime soon ;)  I want to love Sonics!

I have gone to Sonic on occasion since I work in Gilroy.   Normally I don&apos;t like to drive thru at fast food restaurants, but have gotten used to it when going here.   I usually sit in my car and order form the kiosks, then eat my meal in my car before leaving the parking lot.  I love getting the Sonic Burger meal, and love getting the peppermint candy with the meal.   Once in while I&apos;ll drive thru tog et ice cream cones.  I have yet to order some of the other ice cream desserts, but someday.

I guess there aren&apos;t that many Sonics in California because this location is the closest to San Jose compared to all the other ones. Despite this slightly depressing fact, my friends and I actually drove here to try it after seeing all the commercials on TV (the food just looks too good!)

I&apos;m happy to say that we weren&apos;t the least bit disappointed with our food or with the experience. I think the whole set up where you can order 3 different ways is so cool and it&apos;s super cute that the carhops actually skate out to you to deliver your food if you choose to park next to the intercom and order.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger toaster sandwich and a shake while my friends got similar burgers or the footlong coney dog with sides like the onion rings and tater tots. We were all pleased with our orders and we&apos;ve even talked about making the drive again just for their onion rings.

The service here is kind and fast as well. The intercoms can get a little confusing your first time but our &quot;hostess&quot; was patient and helped us order exactly what we wanted correctly.

Came here with my brother again during Happy Hour to take advantage of the drink specials and for him to have his first Coney Dog!

We ordered one Coney Dog, Ched R Peppers, Watermelon Slush and a Pineapple Shake. My brother loved his Coney Dog, Peppers and Watermelon Slush and I totally agree- the Coney Dog is good and the Peppers are pretty damn delicious ... especially with ranch! Woo! The Slush is just the right consistency of ice and flavor, you don&apos;t get chunks of ice sans flavoring at the bottom of your cup. My Pineapple Shake made my tummy feel funny though, something about the chunks of pineapples and very Vanilla-y flavored ice cream didn&apos;t work right.

Will be back, when I have a day free of plans and in need of a delicious slush and some food delivered via car hops.

P.S. The cashier gave me the drinks for happy hour prices and my Ched R Peppers for 80 cents, does this always happen? Oh yeah, saving a buck and chowin&apos; down!

The only time I eat here is when driving through the 152 to get to the Central Valley or SoCal.  It&apos;s just a ritual that my family, friends and I have been accustomed to.

I&apos;m normally not too keen on fast food and don&apos;t set too high of a standard, but the food isn&apos;t necessarily good.  There&apos;s just a lot of variety.  It&apos;s probably one of the only fast food places that offers burgers, dogs, chicken and tots in one location.  There&apos;s too many drinks on the menu for me to even contemplate, I usually get something cherry-lime, and there always seems to be a new dessert to try with each visit.

I give it above average because of the service.  They&apos;re fast and usually on point about making sure you have napkins, condiments etc.  I also have to give a bump up because they hooked it up with free dessert after the dude on skates f&apos;ed up and dropped my entire meal on the ground.

Always a must stop on our way to L.A.

I LOVE love LOVE their Strawberry Limade!! I fell in love with it the first time I had it with its chunks of strawberry in the drink and I get it every time!

I also LOVE their onion rings. I like that crispy, crunchy, slightly sweet batter. YUM! Goes amazing with their buttermilk ranch. Definitely another thing I ALWAYS get!

Everything else I&apos;ve had is just ok. I mean, it IS a fast food restaurant. Every Sonics I&apos;ve been to, never had a problem and the workers are all super nice and accommodating. Always going back to get extra ranch, ketchup, and napkins when we need it :)

I&apos;m leaning toward 2.5 stars based on my last experience. But counting previous visits to Sonic, I&apos;ll round up to 3 stars.

I ordered a cheeseburger, got a normal hamburger. Tots instead and a vanilla milkshake. The burger was ok but, nonetheless disappointing due to the lack of cheese I know I ordered. And because I was traveling to southern California and I was in a hurry I didn&apos;t have time to wait for a second burger. Milkshake was delicious. Tots were good.

In my opinion in comparison to other fast food burgers on the way to SoCal its probably one of the better options. The amount of food is generous in comparison to In-n-Out.

Onion rings- really good
Chili dog- a bit salty
Cherry limeade- awesome!
Sweet tea- sweet?

I came thru here on my way back from a LA trip to get my fix on Sonic. Growing up in Texas, Sonic was everywhere. This is one of the few locations in North Cal that I visit from time to time. It definitely brings back memories. As far as facilities is concerned. there is only one bathroom and that is the Woman&apos;s.

Came here as part of a roadtrip from SF to LA.  This was my first trip ever to Sonic as well as a Drive-In establishment.  Pulled in to one of the little slots in the pouring rain and looked over the menu.  Had many of the standard fast food fare -- difference being they had about a bajillion different drink choices like the ones you may find at an &quot;old timey&quot; soda fountain.  They also offered tater tots and burgers and sandwiches on &quot;toast&quot; as well as something called a Frito Chili Cheese Pie.  Although I was thoroughly intrigued by the Frito Pie, I opted to get chili cheese tots and a chicken sandwich on the toast.  The food was pretty good but I probably won&apos;t be making any special trips out there for it and I still prefer In-n-Out for road trips.

Before I forget, I was told the waiters would be on skates but the were sadly sneaker-clad and wheel-free.  Also, this one guy kept bringing other people&apos;s food to our car...even after we had already gotten our order.  It was also really awesome to be able to pay with a credit card right at the drive-in slot.

Well, I must seriously talk this place up in my head... because it&apos;s really nothing special.

I suppose I&apos;d go to the Sonic before a Mc.Donalds simply for a cherry icy and an opportunity to see people skate the food over to me, and who knows... Perhaps even get a quick laugh if the person skating also eat&apos;s it on their way towards me.  But other than that, the food is a truly bad excuse for a diabetic coma, clogged arteries, or anything of the sort.
Hell, If I&apos;m taking the rare opportunity to put crap into my stomach, I really
want it to be worth the extra crunch or two.

I ordered a Chilly Cheese Coney, and a Cherry Icy... the coney was nothing special, but the icy gave me a brain freeze like none other! Man, how I wish I could go back to yesterday and enjoy that Icy again...

I was out in Gilroy shopping and thought, hey, they have a Sonic here.  Since I&apos;d never been but keep seeing commercials, I decided I would go.

Since I&apos;d never been, I was unaware there was no inside to the restaurant.  I walked up thoroughly confused, but then realized the preferred method is to either drive up to one of the stalls/kiosks, or go through the drive-thru.

Anyhow, once I figured that out, the process was painless.  I went to the drive-thru (I&apos;ve been 2x as of today, was returning stuff).  I got the footlong coney dog combo with tots and a cherry limeade, and I also tried the crispy chicken sandwich.

Honestly, the food is no better or worse than anything else you might get at a fast food joint.  The coney dog was a sight to behold, being that it was a footlong, but otherwise unspectacular.  The crispy chicken sandwich was par for the course.

To me the real allure here is tots (TOTS!!!) and the limeades.  I had tots and cherry limeades both times.  Tots are fantastic, and the limeades are good.  Unfortunately, neither is good enough to drive out to Gilroy for, so I&apos;ll just learn to deal without freshly fried tots and I can make my own cherry limeades I&apos;m sure.

If I&apos;m out in Gilroy I&apos;d go here, but otherwise I&apos;ll wait until they build one closer.

chili cheese tater tots FTW.

Tater tots - the unspoiled memory from your child hood. All grown up with chili and cheese. Mmm.

Surprisingly slow late at night with no one around. Server didn&apos;t come out on skates, but the guy changing the trash bags was.

FYI, value menu is located on the bottom right corner of the menu.

I have been hyping  Sonic&apos;s food in my head for quite some time now...  Visions of Slushies, Texas toast, fluffy egs, Hamburgers and tots danced in my head.  I scorned myself for living in the tri-valley which didn&apos;t have a SONIC nearby.   So when we drove past this Sonic on the way to Casa De Fruta, I insisted we stop by on the way home.

I love the whole concept of &quot;DRIVE-In&quot; because I love that 50&apos;s vibe of driving up to your own stall, looking at the menu and having your food rollerskated up to your window.  THAT was fun!  I was dissappointed however , that they did not attach a FOOD tray to our window, you know? &quot;A LA Fred Flinstone&quot; style?

Well anyways.... Ordered the burger, slushie(cherry lemonade) and chili/cheese tater tots.

-Burger: a bit anemic, but nothing to &quot;write home&quot; to mom about...
-Chili/cheese Tots: I have high expectations for Chili, I hate BLAND chili... this was bland.. I don&apos;t care whether it&apos;s just a &quot;Topping&quot; for something, folks need to take pride in Chili that&apos;s why Chili is highlighed in festivals and cook offs!!!
-Slushie- That was good sweet and tart at the same time.

Next time I see a Sonic I will try to stop for breakfast next time, and maybe their shakes... but it&apos;s not a place that I will dream about anymore... *sigh*

One of my favorite places to go.  It&apos;s a good thing they don&apos;t have one in San Jose because I will end up gaining more weight than I need to.  But it is definitely a place I will drive to if they urge arises.

I love the drink options they have.  So many to choose and it&apos;s not your regular fast food restaurant drinks...sodas or ice tea.  The food is good too.  My faves are the Chicago style hot dogs and the burgers.  I love that this place has the eat-in-your car option especially since my son can eat strapped in his car seat.  So hard to eat in restaurants with a 3-year old.

Other than the fun experience of driving up to the window and having someone on rollerblades or roller skates come and take your order, the food is bleh.  The burger did not impress me one bit and I will have to stick to In N Out or McDonalds for my fast food fix.

The factory outlets are one exit away.  I think that&apos;s useful to know.

This is a Sonic for sure.  All the Sonic-ness was present.  The location was a little odd and hard to get out of if you need to turn left.

What can I say that I&apos;ve not said in my reviews about other locations?  The lady at the 76 station down one exit knew where it was.  That was good to find.  Oh! Also, of the locations I&apos;ve been to, I think this was the first one I&apos;ve found where they wear roller blades.  Other places have had them on regular skates or just walk your grub out to you.

The food was as expected.  This location had that basic chicken sandwich Mrs N loves so much.  I always get the toaster chicken one.  They have good onion rings.  Try them please.  That is all.

Vegetarians CAN eat a meal here!

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and added lettuce, tomato, onions, and jalepeno to it. It was SO TASTY. By the way, the large cheesy tots are good to feed 3 people as a snacker. I definitely want to try their shakes or sundaes if I return. Service is really nice here too.

I LOVE SONICS.

I guess I&apos;m not like everyone else who prefers to get their burgers at In-N-out. I actually think sonic&apos;s burgers are better. They are absolutely delicious. I usually get the bacon cheeseburger and it is sooooo good. I&apos;ve also tried the chicken wrap, tots, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. Those are all pretty good too.  Everytime the boyfriend and I pass Gilroy, we ALWAYS have to stop by Sonics. ;] yuuuum

We came here before hitting the outlets today. My bf and I normally get the same order all the time when we get the chance. Their buns for their burger are fresh and the texture are just fine for us. Not hard nor too soft but just fine. Well, along our burgers, we also ordered the Chilli Cheese tots. I recommend getting Large if you&apos;re sharing.
Our favorite dessert here is the Java Chiller Hazelnut. It&apos;s the best chiller. I&apos;d rather come to a Sonic rather than McD or BK only if they have more around the bay.

The costumer service here btw, has been by far the best Sonic service we&apos;ve experience. Some Sonic costumer services are horrible but today it very exceptional.

Finally after many years of seeing Sonic commercials (even though I didn&apos;t live near a Sonic), I&apos;ve tried Sonic.  It&apos;s adorable in a retro spaceship 1950&apos;s kind of way where the car hop delivers your meal on rollerskates and people eat in their cars.

You can park in a stall, order and eat all without getting out of your car.  Press the red button when you&apos;re ready to order and you can pay right there with your credit card.  A car hop on rollerskates will bring you napkins, condiments and your food.  It seemed really convenient but then the people next to me decided to stand there and smoke - how unappetizing and annoying.

The full menu is available all day (so you can get tater tots&amp;a sundae for breakfast, wow) and it includes floats, shakes, malts, chillers, slushes, limeade, sundaes, burgers, chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches, Fritos chili cheese pie, salads, breakfast items, snacks like popcorn chicken, chili cheese tots (!), onion rings and more.  For $1, you can add on a Jr. candy sundae or get a vanilla cone. With the meal combos, you can choose between tater tots and French fries.

* XL Coney chili cheese dog ($3.29): it must have been a foot long.  The hot dog was narrow and long. The dog was extremely salty and the steamed bun was very soft.  I could cut through it easily with a fork.  I didn&apos;t like anything about it.
* Tater tots: Came in the cutest container, the tots were warm and slightly crispy.  I like crunchier, hotter tots.

I was somewhat disappointed but maybe I ordered the wrong things.  It seems like a fun place with many options to choose from and drive thru desserts.  Plus they give you a free mint :)

I&apos;ve been holding on to this one for a couple of weeks now and what more fitting for my 100th review than Sonic!!??

We&apos;ve all seen the commercials for Sonic as they taunt us with their slushees and tater tots---and then pause to think, where is the closest Sonic for us to fulfill this craving? For the many of us in the South Bay, that used to be Tracy. And although gas prices are a bit down these days, I could never justify that far of a trek for fast food.

But one glorious day, I get a message from a fellow Yelper telling me that they were opening one in Gilroy! Yipppeee!!!

So, as a treat after some very successful holiday shopping at the outlets, the BF and I cruise over to finally have some Sonic goodness. (Note to you all: this Sonic is not at the Gilroy Premium Outlets exit but off of the 152 East exit--towards the road to LA).

We pulled up to the &quot;classic&quot; intercom and place our order. The system was pretty efficient though it isn&apos;t clear if the &quot;card sliding system&quot; is just for the Sonic card or if you can use debit/credit cards with it too. Our delivery gal rolls up (literally &quot;rolls&quot; since she&apos;s on skates) to our car with our tray of Sonic yummy-ness. Jalapeno Bacon Burger, Coney Dog, tater tots and limeade slushees. Mmmm-hmmm...

Did it hit the spot? UH-HUH! Was it tasty? HECK YEAH! Did I have remorse from eating all of that grease? Um, little bit...but we got over it.

Guess I know where I&apos;m stopping on my drive up back from LA this weekend. Granted 4 stars may be a bit high but I think I&apos;m still reveling in the fact that this location is so much closer to us. For now, I say our food was Sonic-riffic!!!  :)

ps. Everyday from 2-4pm they have a &quot;Happy Hour&quot;.  1/2 off of their drinks and slushees.

I started my New Year by taking a ride to Gilroy and hitting up Sonic!  I have been to Sonic before in the tiny town of Sierra Vista, AZ.  Sonic was one of the first things there many years ago when my sister first moved there.  I could never figure out why there were commercials for Sonic here when there was no Sonic in San Jose.  At least there is one in Gilroy now and it&apos;s a short drive.

This brought back memories of going to A&amp;W when I was little.  I love the car hops and the push the button to order option.  Now to the food....

I had a bacon cheesburger and it was ok.  I still LOVE the western bacon cheeseburger from Carl&apos;s Jr.  Sonic&apos;s onion rings were delish!  They had a light batter on the outside and the onions were sweet.  Yummy!  They have diet Dr. Pepper!  Yay!  Not many places have diet Dr. Pepper so I was happy.  My daughter had a kids meal with a hot dog and fries and she loved it.  She got a limeade and sucked the whole thing down in not time flat!  She said it was really good.

For dessert we had a milkshake.....mmmm....all I remember was that it was so creamy and yummy!!  Vanilla, it was vanilla, cause that is my shake test.  haha!!

Will I go back?  You bet!!  I wanna try some other stuff too!  And they have a great drink selection.  If you have not tried Sonic......you must!

It...has....ARRIVED!
Yes! I can finally cross off Sonic on my list of reasons to drive to Stockton or Fresno.
We&apos;ve all seen the commercials, and now is your chance to pig out and make a huge mess in your car.
First of all, how can someone call a fast food drive in over hyped? *ahemmChrisahem*
It&apos;s effin&apos; fast food... not like they are grinding up kobe beef for their burgers or venturing out to Star Route farms for that perfect organic iceberg lettuce.
Junk food at its finest folks.
Get the onion rings every time.
Also since this is a new location, they don&apos;t have their promo items on the menu yet.
So ask for the STICKY BUN SUNDAE.
It&apos;s so good it just might put you to sleep, so make sure you&apos;re not the one driving.

Here&apos;s one spin on the onion rings I did when the gf and I did an overnight Sonic&apos;s run in Fresno one weekend.
I chopped up the onion rings and incorporated it into scrambled eggs.
Throw some ketchup on that sucker and eat with rice.
Best way to start your day!

After seeing countless commercials advertising a fast food chain thats no where near me, i finally got the chance to try this place when i was shopping at the gilroy outlets!

it cost me about $13 for 3 small milkshakes, 2 cheeseburgers, 1 hamburger, and 1 med. onion rings.

milkshakes: these were pretty tasty..i had the pineapple shake and there were bits of pineapple in it!! tastay!  my bf  had the peach which was pretty good and friend got the banana
hamburgers: pretty filling.  i think they put too much mayo, mustard, and ketchup tho
onion rings: YUM! the onion slices are pretty big and i can actually TASTE the onion..unlike burger king&apos;s onion rings.  a bit on the oily side..but then again what do u expect..it&apos;s fried
service: u push a button and order your food.  then you pay at the little stand..i wonder if they take cash...?  they also have waiters and waitresses on rollerblades!!

There seems to be a subset of establishments that hold a unique place in Yelpdom; chains that in some parts of the universe are as common hat wearing truckers, yet in other parts are a rarity.  What is it that would drive one to go out of their way to find it?  One theory has it that it is the all-encompassing desire among humans to experience what it is that is happening on the other side, the &quot;what is it I&apos;m missing out on?&quot; factor.  It&apos;s still food, but &quot;we have to see, we have to know&quot; must play a role.

I do love the madness that is the 5 freeway. I have made that trip between L.A. and the Bay area perhaps 50 times in my life, each has presented me with nothing less than six hours of bliss, the open road, a fast German automobile, and a clear mind.  While any trip is always made better with a significant other in tow, even without anyone significant in my life now I do cherish moments where I am allowed to sit and look at the road ahead, literally and figuratively.  Now there are six spots worth stopping for...

Depending on your point of origin, this, the elusive Sonic, will occupy my first or sixth spot worth stopping for.  In the majestic city of Gilroy, you will know you have arrived in this town when you smell under your arms to ensure deodorant has been applied; have no fear, this town is known as the Garlic capital, the aroma is unmistakable.  (Well, almost)  Inside a shopping complex, it is initially a bit confusing, there is no access from the main drag, you must go through the hardware store shopping plaza.

I think this is by design, they want you to want it.  A check off the box establishment to say, &quot;Yes, I wanted to go there and did.&quot;  It&apos;s an upscale fast-food restaurant(?), and there are much better places to hit on the route, but I wanted to cover this one first because of one fact:  I love a place that can cook up a good batch of taters and/or rings and this place does it better than any other business with a drive-thru that I have had the opportunity to visit.  So you got that covered, what else is there you ask?

The Lime-Aids are an experience unto themselves, they will hit your pucker harder than a college co-ed and will stay around just as long.  They have sandwiches on actual sandwich bread, that&apos;s nice, and the BBQ sauce is not bad compared to other establishments.  My only gripe is there are so many flowers around the drive-thru box you take your life in your hands placing an order, holy Jesus there are enough bees flying around to make me need to visit the restroom after placing my order.

I think that the corporate marketing team at Sonic is genius.  They advertise on cable stations throughout the country which may, or may not have a Sonic in their area.  It makes fools like me that live in the Bay Area crave to be part of the phenomena that is Sonic and try them out.  On December 30th, that dream came true.  (Well, in the Bay Area, anyway, because I have  been to one in Utah ... it just makes for a more of an epic story if I said it was my first visit to the restaurant EVER.)

We drove down to the 152 exit, turned left (heading south) and like a beacon, saw the sign for Sonic.  We drove-in, took our spot in one of the multiple drive-in stalls, and studied the menu.  It&apos;s your standard drive-in/fast food, with a few interesting menu items like Frito Pie wraps, and everyone&apos;s favorite:  tater tots.

I ended up ordering a breakfast burrito meal, which came with tater tots and a medium drink.  For an additional ten cents, I added some sugar-free cherry &quot;flavoring&quot; to my diet Sprite.

While the food wasn&apos;t all that impressive, I would have to say the experience in itself was worth the wait.  I now can say that I was part of the Sonic phenomena, and can mark that off as one of the things that I&apos;ve always wanted to try.  Next stop, if I ever can, a real White Castle!

I first had Sonic back when I worked in Houston in 1998.  It was a decent burger, but it was all about the shakes.  I didn&apos;t have it again until a wedding in Las Vegas last year.  Again, decent food, but it was all about the shakes.

I heard a few weeks ago that a Sonic had opened up in Gilroy but forgot about it until I drove 152E on my way to LA.  I was tempted to go but decided to make it an unofficial UYE with whoever wanted to come out.

Last night I met up with Jon, Jackie, Mikey, and John for some Sonic.  It was packed and we initially didn&apos;t get a drive-in space at around 5:15pm.  We finally finagled one (out of 3 cars) and like the Azn gangstas we are, hovered around the Mazda.

We realized quickly the order would be hideous with 5 people, so we wrote our orders down.  Correction, *I* scribbled down what their greedy appetites desired.  Feh.  In total we had about 25 items between us ranging from chili cheese tater tots to cheddar peppers to m&amp;m sonic blasts.  Nom.

This isn&apos;t the best food but it&apos;s good to just eat OK food once in awhile.  For that hour, I felt like a college student again chilling with some friends on finals week.  I ordered chili cheese tots, a sonic burger, and an m&amp;m sonic blast.  The tots and burger were 3s, the shake was a 4.

It was great hanging with everyone.  We joked and talked about our holidays and rock climbing and had so many &quot;That&apos;s what she said&quot; moments all thanks to my Dunder-Mifflin hoodie, which my dad thought came from the company I worked for.  Yes, he actually thought I worked for a company called Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.  He was even more confused when I told him the company wasn&apos;t real.

Anyhow, back to the &quot;That&apos;s what she said&quot; moments:
* Wow that&apos;s huge!
* It&apos;s longer than I thought.
* I can&apos;t suck it up.
* If I press this harder they&apos;ll come faster.
* Can we get more ranch sauce?

OK that last one didn&apos;t make sense unless you are really kinky or something.

THANK YOU TPTB for making my Sonic dreams a reality.

There&apos;s a big banner stating that they have &quot;employees in training&quot;.  And then a guy rolls by on skates.  Sweet.

Our drive thru person repeats my order to ensure correctness.  This irritates my husband, but delights me.

Cool things included in my meal (that normally aren&apos;t).
* A red&amp;green Starlite mint - resting on top of my cherry limeade
* A single packet of iodized salt - because sodium is your frenemy
* A copy of their entire menu - tucked away for my happy hour reference (1/2 off all drinks - woo hoo!).

This will be my permanent stopping point as we travel through the garlic capital.

It doesn&apos;t even deserve a star!! We try to make two orders while in the drive thru so we let them know about it at the beginning. We finish the first order n want to make a second n they shut us off n we keep talking and they don&apos;t respond. We were there for awhile and we were ignored. We get to the window and it&apos;s a bunch of teenagers messing around laughing and playing. We got a crazy idea to make the second order and they tell us to park while we wait. Fifteen minutes passed and finally the girl comes out and says &quot;umm...we forgot your order, can we see your receipt.&quot;Such bad bad service. Like are you serious?!! this was honestly the worst service i have gotten anywhere.

I went and ate at Johnny Carino&apos;s for dinner but I was already in Gilroy so I had to come to Sonic for something.... Drive-thru dessert!!

I got a strawberry milkshake which was reallllly good, nice and thick with real strawberry chunks!  My mom got a chocolate sundae with a cherry... I stole the cherry and the sundae was meh... My step-dad got the banan split and devoured it before we got to try any so I&apos;m assuming it was scrumptious!

All of the stalls were packed so we had to do the drive-thru thing and then parked on the other side to stuff our faces with the icy treats in the cold weather lol... I really really wanna go for the slushes at the happy hour!!  And I want to try the coconut slush thing it sounds good!!

Watching the workers skate around is pretty entertaining too, and it seems they have their own radio station or the likes of it playing... but the guy at the drive-thru window looked like he was 10, seriously... my mom thought he was a girl lol...

There were tons of people just hanging around, some skateboarding, some otherwise just being teenagers.... then about three or four old VW bugs showed up which was a highlight for me... seems to be the place to be late night Sundays...

I will make another trip here at some point so be expecting an update!

Prior to this location, I used to go the Tracy location to get my fix on the coney dogs and famous slushes. It was a drag to go through the crowded two lanes of 580. It is now a straight shot on 101...about 30 minutes or so. You will still hit some traffic when you exit the 152 East exit. Nonetheless, it is worth it. Personally, I love the food at Sonic despite the fact that many regard it as overrated. I usually order the foot long coney dog with onions and tater tots with cheese and chili with a Route 44 bubble gum slushy to wash it all down.

Since the location is fairly new, the drive-in can get very crowded. There are cones to lead you to the drive through or parking stalls. With my stomach growling, I ran over a couple cones to park in one of the open stalls. Might I add, that there were only a few stalls available. There is a huge banner, &quot;Training in Progress&quot; which explains why my order was wrong the first time. It wasn&apos;t a big deal as they forgot my chili cheese tots.

Be sure to head over there when you get a chance.

i LOVE the limeades. DELICIOUS. craved it for a long time then finally got it. everything else on the menu is just ok.

spent $59 here for 5 people. the thing is that i ate most of the food. they probably had 1-3 things at the most while i ate much more than they did. it was really sad. i had....bacon cheeseburger toaster, cheddar peppers, onion rings, corn dog, chili tots, cherry limeade, and the rest of or more than half of the bf&apos;s m&amp;m ice cream blast thing. yes, ate all that. the food is good. i can probably only eat this stuff once every few months.

mmmmm....limeade...

OMG.... I nearly passed out at the office when Jenn W told me that Sonics was opening up in Gilroy...

The corn dogs are just as good as I remember... the strawberry cream slushes make me drool. Order to serve time was long but this place is heavenly... it makes my inner fat child sing with glee!

I had the LONGEST chili cheese dog that I have ever eaten yesterday .. and it was the BEST!

Yesterday was my first time ever coming to Sonic. I&apos;ve been wanting to for the LONGEST time but they don&apos;t have much location in the area. We drove about half and hour just to get some Sonic last night .. boo!

The chili cheese &quot;corney&quot; was great and so was the strawberry limeade (I think that&apos;s how you spell it!).

I love that they have speakers on every lot for the cars. I haven&apos;t witnessed the employees roller blade out to serve any food, but I will someday!

Love it!

We came here after running the Warrior Dash, so we were pretty hungry and I was eager to try this place out because I had never been here before. It seemed a lot of other participants got the same idea because once we pulled in, all the parking stalls were filled! Luckily, on our way around, one car was just pulling out. We looked over the menu and pushed the order button. A few minutes later, a worker took our order and our food came out shortly after. The wait time was minimal and we actually thought it was pretty quick.

I got the grilled chicken sandwich with mustard instead of mayo (I&apos;m not a fan of mayo). Two of my guy friends split the Footlong Quarter Pound Coney, the Chicken Club Toaster Sandwich, Mozzarella Sticks, and Ched &apos;R&apos; Peppers. My grilled chicken sandwich was a nice healthy option for a fast food place, so I wasn&apos;t expecting something spectacularly amazing. It was just average. The chicken tasted like chicken and it had lettuce and tomato and a squished wheat bun to hold it all together.

The guys seemed to enjoy their food, but no one really raved about it, so I am guessing it was enough to be satisfying, but nothing to brag about. I also tried the Ched &apos;R&apos; Peppers just because they sounded interesting... which they were... but not necessarily in a good way. It was a slice of a pepper filled with cheddar cheese and deep fried. For all the calories, you think it would taste amazing, but it was nearly tasteless! The only thing that gave it away that I was eating deep fried cheese was the greasy crunch from the first bite and the thick orangey yellow oozing liquid I could feel in my mouth.

Overall, the service was good and the concept is pretty cool, but the food is just average, if not below average. It was nice to try it once and say I&apos;ve been here, but I think I will avoid this place in the future if I am given another option. I do hear that their drinks are good, but I&apos;ve also heard that they&apos;re super sugary and you easily get sick of the sweetness.
