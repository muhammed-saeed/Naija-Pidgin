Local Pick Up / Paypal Question : WWYD?
 I have a question for you all. I did a Buy-It-Now for an camping air mattress that is being sold by a seller who clearly states that they accept Paypal. They have a local store in a business park not too far from me. They state in all their listings that they offer free local pick up.

So I did the buy-it-now and went to pay for the item. The invoice only gave 2 shipping options, and did not have an option for the free pick up. So I contacted the seller through Ebay messaging and asked if he could send me an invoice without shipping costs on it (I said that I could also subtract the shipping costs from the existing invoice myself, but wanted to make sure that he knew what I was doing before I started deducting costs).

He emailed me back that I should just pay for the item when I pick it up. (Yes it did occur to me that that reply could be interpreted as a request to complete the sale off Ebay, which is a no-no.)

I responded that I wanted to pay using Paypal, and that I could only do that online.

(What I didn&apos;t mention is that I&apos;m using this purchase to qualify for the Paypal $15 rebate, so I definitely want to use Paypal and not just put it on a credit card directly with the company).

So he messaged back that for pick up orders, I HAVE TO pay on pickup. No Paypal is accepted for pick up orders as they have to provide a tracking number to Paypal. Then he emailed me an invoice with the shipping charges included (as $19 or $38 incidently, which is why I definitely don&apos;t want it to be shipped).

First thing. Nowhere in his listing does it state that Paypal is not accepted for pick up orders. That&apos;s probably forbidden by Ebay. If he says he accepts Paypal, then he has to accept Paypal - period. That&apos;s correct, isn&apos;t it?

Second thing: is what he&apos;s saying true? Does Paypal REQUIRE tracking numbers to be submitted? How would that work if a seller sent something by first class mail? The total value of the item is only a little above $30, btw - it&apos;s nothing super expensive or unusual. It is heavy, though, which is why the cost for shipping it is high. I&apos;m trying to figure out whether this is a BS explanation or a legitimate concern for him as a seller. What&apos;s everybody&apos;s opinion on this?

I don&apos;t want a war, but I get the impression that he&apos;d be up for a war if I pushed it. Still, I&apos;m not willing to be a pushover if he&apos;s full of ...stuff... and is just scamming a way to get out of having to pay Paypal fees (by insisting that I pay him directly).

When I respond to him next, I want to make sure that I have my ducks in a row and know where I stand on all fronts. I don&apos;t want to be unreasonable if he has a legitimate Paypal concern and I really don&apos;t want to go the dispute route if I can help it, because I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to come out ahead if I do. But if he doesn&apos;t have a legitimate concern regarding the tracking number and is just being a little shady, then I may choose to insist that he accept Paypal, and if he won&apos;t, then I will have no choice but to dispute.

So.... what would you do? Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  04:17 PM #2 valkaz

He doesn&apos;t have to provide a tracking number to Paypal. Paypal does not care anything about tracking number - unless it&apos;s during a dispute. I suppose he&apos;s trying to avoid that - and if you pick it up, then he doesn&apos;t have a delivery confirmation available option to back him up if you end up filing a dispute. I understand his concerns - but I also understand yours with wanting to pay via Paypal. Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  04:17 PM #3 Gooddealie

 1/2007 Join Date Dec 2004 Posts 6,360 Hmmm.... Googling around, he might have a legitimate concern because receipt of an item cannot be confirmed with a local pick up. So technically I could get the item, then dispute and he&apos;d lose the dispute because he couldn&apos;t prove I&apos;d received the item. No I don&apos;t plan to do that, but I can understand why he&apos;d be reluctant to accept a Paypal pament.

OK, he may have my sympathy on that account, but the bottom line is that he didn&apos;t have a Paypal-not-accepted-for-pickups clause in his text. I think he was required to have that clause in his auction description (yes he is allowed to put that in). Had I seen it, I likely wouldn&apos;t have bought the item from him.

Can anybody think of an acceptable way for me to pick it up and yet give him something (anything?) that would stand up with Paypal if I initiated a dispute? I&apos;d like to be able to offer a compromise that would work for both of us. Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  04:21 PM #4 valkaz

I understand his concerns - but I also understand yours with wanting to pay via Paypal. Arg. I think you&apos;re right, but I&apos;m trying to figure out a compromise.

On principle alone, I think I&apos;d win a dispute because, as you said, he didn&apos;t specify that Paypal is not accepted on pick ups, so he is obligated to accept Paypal under all conditions. Supposedly there is a new rule on the books that does make it legitimate to accept cash/CODs for pick ups and not accept Paypal. But there has to be something written into the auction description about it. He didn&apos;t have it written in, so he&apos;s SOL in that respect.

His response to me that I have to to pay off Ebay was badly phrased and probably wouldn&apos;t help his case either.

But... I do understand where his concern is coming from. It&apos;s valid, and I really don&apos;t have any itention of doing an illegitimate dispute. I&apos;d love to give him something to make him more comfortable, but I&apos;m not wanting to give up all my rights down the road in case there *is* a problem with the air mattress when I receive it (like it leaks like a sieve!) Honestly though, if I pay by credit card at his store, he&apos;d have no guarantee that I wouldn&apos;t do a chargeback either, so I really don&apos;t see why he&apos;d feel any more comfortable with that solution.

That&apos;s very true. Wonder why he&apos;s not thinking of that? Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  05:33 PM #7 my3joes

 Registered User Join Date Jan 2007 Posts 2,174 If you pay by paypal and go pick up the item and turn around in a month and file an item not recieved, your seller doesn&apos;t have a leg to stand on. He would have to refund your money and eat up whatever punishment Paypal and Ebay give him because he does not have the delivery number to prove anything. I&apos;m certainly not saying that you would do this but a great deal of sellers getted duped this way. I would NEVER let anybody pick up an item unless they payed by cash or something other than paypal.

While he has Paypal listed as a form of payment he accepts, he is not denying that you can use it. He is just saying that you will have to pay for the shipping as well. This is why you should always ask questions before you purchase an item. You should hash this type of thing out before you purchase. What is his feedback like?

If you do pay when you pick up, make sure you get a reciept for payment. Otherwise you might be the one who gets a payment not recieved strike. Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  06:45 PM #8 Gooddealie

If you do pay when you pick up, make sure you get a reciept for payment. Otherwise you might be the one who gets a payment not recieved strike. I understand (now, after doing some research) that as a seller, he would be at great risk. And I sympathize, I really do. But he needed to have those exceptions written into his item description. If he had, he&apos;d have been covered and I probably wouldn&apos;t have chosen to buy that item.

But the thing is that he didn&apos;t write any of that stuff in and consequently yes he did leave himself wide open. I have no intention of saying I didn&apos;t receive the item, but at the same time I also do not feel comfortable completing the transaction off Ebay at his request (which is totally against Ebay policy), and using some payment method I hadn&apos;t had any intention of using (I really don&apos;t want to give this guy cash or my credit card info at this point, especially when his listing said I wouldn&apos;t have to do that in the first place).

It&apos;s also not ok that he insists that I pay the shipping. According to his item description, free local pickup is available to anybody living in the city. I qualify for that. I shouldn&apos;t have to eat a $19 or $38 shipping charge because he screwed up and did not write his item description in a way that covered his behind better! So no, I don&apos;t intend to give into that demand - for sure!

I talked to Ebay customer service this afternoon via their LIVE chat program and he looked at the listing and said that the seller was obligated to take Paypal and give free local pickup, as per his listing, and that I should report him, end of story. So I assume that the chances of me winning a dispute are pretty good.

So... what do I want? If it&apos;s emotional satisfaction, I can write him a scathing email, dispute the transaction and probably win... and probably get a negative feedback from him in return. But this is so not worth taking a feedback hit for! Especially since it&apos;s not my fault!

If it&apos;s the mattress... which I do want and it is at a much lower price than I&apos;ll be able to get elsewhere, then I could give into his demands, drive down there, hand him cash and walk away with it, cross my fingers that he didn&apos;t stick it with a bunch of nails, and the transaction stands. Basically I&apos;d take the hit for his listing mistakes.

Or I could report him with the goal of getting the transaction canceled. And THEN drive down there in a week or two and hand him cash and he&apos;d have no idea who I was. 

Or I could write a relatively short, factual email saying that while I sympathize with his dilemma, I do expect him to carry out the terms as stated in his listing. Essentially I&apos;d be saying his listing omissions are not my problem. Anything less than a Paypal transaction with free pickup will not be acceptable. And then see what he does.

Does anybody see a better option that I&apos;m missing? Any suggestions for which option would be best? Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  08:16 PM #9 Gooddealie

 1/2007 Join Date Dec 2004 Posts 6,360 BTW... just curious... but if I went down to his store, paid with cash, and then 10 days later he turns around and files a NPB on me, would *I* have any proof that would satisfy Paypal that I paid for the item?

Even a credit card receipt might be dicey depending on the name he processes his credit card transactions under (if it&apos;s different than his Ebay name, I might have a tough time proving it was the same company).

Hmmm.

Should I ask him to cancel the transaction if he&apos;s not willing to abide by his listing&apos;s terms as written? Or should I just dispute, since he&apos;ll be able to leave me neg. feedback anyway? Reply With Quote 03-17-2007,  08:35 PM #10 jtbull46

simple answer
 I am not a phi beta kappa from harvard, but there is an easy way to handle this. Do you want the item? If the answer is yes just pick the thing up and pay then. You dont need quadratic equations to figure that out. The guy probably makes a few bucks on shipping, which he is not if you want to pick it up. The issue with fraud is also a concetn. There was a post of some user that was charging back stuff like mad. I would do it the way he wants, or just ask him to cancel the bid and buy from someone who will. That simple. No rocket science involved. Reply With Quote
