		Yuca Fries with a Garlic Dipping Sauce

This weekend the weather in Atlanta was amazing and perfect for grilling. So I decided to try  Atlanta blogger, Your Southern Peach ’s recipe for Mango and Cilantro Chicken on the grill to pair with my recipe for Yuca Fries.

My family is from the Caribbean and Yuca is a popular root served there. It’s very similar to a potato.  The first time I had Yuca was when I was visiting my grandmother in Miami as a child from a fast food restaurant called Pollo Tropical . We usually eat them in a fry form served with a garlic sauce. It’s one of my favorite treats to eat when I go to Miami.

You can find Yuca at your local Spanish grocery store, Publix , or farmers market. I found mine in the frozen international food section at Publix. Yuca is a healthier alternative to a potato and great for kids too!

 Ingredients 

1 bag of Frozen Yuca

1/4 teaspoon of sea salt

1/2 cup of Canola oil

5 cloves of garlic

Juice from 1 lemon

1/2 cup olive oil

Water

 How to prepare 

Place Yuca in a large sauce pan and add enough water to cover it by at least 3 inches. Add salt to the water and bring to boil. Cook Yuca on medium for about 15 minutes until the Yuca is tender but still intact. Drain Yuca on a paper towel. Once the Yuca has cooled down. Cut them into 1/3 thick fries.

In a separate pan, heat canola oil. Once oil is heated add Yuca Fries to the pan. Turn constantly and cook for about 7 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Once fries are done place them on a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle with Sea Salt.

 For the Sauce 

In a small bowl, toss the garlic, lemon juice, and oil olive. Place about 2 tablespoons of sauce in mini ramekins for dipping.

Enjoy!

Tomorrow, Amy from Your Southern Peach will be guest blogging on Eat.Drink.Shop.Love, sharing one of her favorite recipes.
