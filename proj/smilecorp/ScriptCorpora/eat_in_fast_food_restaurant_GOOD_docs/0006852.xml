Food Trucks 101: How to Start a Mobile Food Business
 Want to take your recipes on the road? Here are the basics. BY Entrepreneur Press and Rich Mintzer | July 25, 2011 | Comment Tweet 

A new generation of street food lovers are lining up at food trucks and food carts. Though the idea is a long-standing part of American and world culture, the street food industry has never enjoyed so much popularity or publicity.

Chefs can open up shop for much less than a restaurant, and develop simple menus that focus on particular cuisines or ingredients. Fans can follow their favorite trucks on Twitter and sample an assortment of dishes at large gatherings of trucks. Even the Food Network has leapt on the trend with The Great Food Truck Race, which features gourmand trucks like Roxy&apos;s Grilled Cheese; Seabirds (vegan cuisine); Spencer on the Go (authentic French foods like escargot); and the season one winner, Grill&apos;Em All, a heavy-metal themed truck from Los Angeles that serves gourmet hamburgers.

 Beyond the Food Truck: Six Ideas for Mobile Food Businesses

The industry is booming with approximately 3 million food trucks in the U.S., more than 5 million food carts, and an unknown number of kiosks, which have appeared in malls, train and bus stations, airports, stadiums, conference centers and other locations in recent years.

Food industry observers claim that the increase in food truck business is largely in response to the slow-growing economy. People are seeking inexpensive breakfasts and lunches. Also, more employees are often pressed for time, with more work and shorter lunch hours. With new gourmet trucks, foodies can also sample unique dishes for less than a restaurant meal.

From an entrepreneurial standpoint, mobile food businesses have a lower overhead and require fewer employees than restaurants and can be easily moved if one location does not generate enough business.

Here&apos;s a quick rundown of nuts and bolts of the food-truck business, including the basics for getting started.

 

 Going Mobile: Your Options 
Even before you decide what foods to sell, you&apos;ll want to consider how you want to sell them. There are several options, including the ubiquitous food truck; food kiosks (small, temporary food stands in malls, stadiums, airports and other locations); food carts that sell pre-prepared or easy-to-prepare food like hot dogs and ice cream; and catering trucks. A new option is&quot;bustaurants,&quot;refurbished double-decker buses where patrons dine on the second level.

A decision on how to sell your foods will depend on:

 Your startup budget and potential for returns Your commitment to the business: part or full time Your creative ideas and what it will take to fulfill them The type of food you wish to prepare Your experience at running a business The size of the business you want to start Your ideal demographic 

 Typical Customers 
There are several demographic groups that can provide potential customers. Who you focus on influences your menu, locations, and daily schedule of food preparation. You might focus on the breakfast or lunch crowd at office parks, where quick service is crucial. Other options are tourists, who might want to experience your home-town favorites, or event attendees who want a bite to eat between innings or before the headlining band goes on. Still another option is late-nighters, those hungry club-goers craving the types of gluttonous, greasy snacks best consumed after midnight.

 Startup Costs 
There&apos;s no set formula for determining how much it costs to start a mobile food business. The field is broad, and there are too many possibilities.

You might spend $3,000 on a food cart, $500 on your initial food bill, $400 on permits and registrations, $200 on marketing, $300 on an attorney, and $300 for the first month to park and clean the cart. Tack on $300 in other miscellaneous costs, and you&apos;re off and running for $5,000.

On the other hand, you could spend $60,000 on a retrofitted food truck, and miscellaneous amounts on initial ingredients, permits and licenses, commercial kitchen rental, kitchen supplies, parking and truck maintenance, marketing and promotion, and packaging. It could cost as much as $75,000.

But, compared to a restaurant, $75,000 is not bad for starting a business. The point is that startup costs can vary greatly. You need to do the math on your plans before spending any money so you do not run out before you get started.

 A Day in the Life 
Most mobile food business owners follow a routine, whether they run their own mobile unit or have employees run it. The routine may include very early morning food shopping a few days a week, if not every day. Then there is food prep, possibly at a commercial kitchen location, and then stocking the kiosk or vehicle and heading to your destination. There is also a need to take some time during the day for marketing, usually via Twitter or other social media. At the end of the day, it&apos;s time to clean up.

Most mobile food vendors work about 10 hours a day. Then there are office tasks: paying taxes and bills, renewing licenses, and handling other paperwork responsibilities. The work generally is tiring and the days can be long.

 Do You Have What It Takes? 
To earn money in mobile food service means being hungry. It means moving fast before too many players get into the game and your city limits its licenses. It means having menu items your competitors don&apos;t have (or at least making your own unique versions of popular favorites), and finding locations that aren&apos;t already teeming with competitors.

Mobile lunch trucks have long been based on the simple concept of bringing quality food to people in areas where there are not many other food choices. Now it is also about bringing cost-friendly options to places where there are other food choices. Faster service and lower prices allow you to compete with brick-and-mortar eateries. To succeed, you need to serve good, in some areas perhaps even unique, food and maintain the highest levels of cleanliness.

We are trying to sell our 2002 Grumman-Olson Chevy Workhorse truck that we are currently using as a mobile retail store.  It&apos;s got about 89,000 miles on it, is in excellent shape (we just got it inspected and had some minor repairs taken care of), and the box has been outfitted with a ton of cool stuff - power, lighting, bamboo and cork floors, bamboo cabinetry, shelving, countertops, etc etc etc.  Easily convertible to a food truck.
If interested, please let us know.

It can be a good business idea. Of course, you need to consider what kind of food you&apos;ll be bringing to the table. Consider the locations where you can sell the food. Think of your potential customers. It&apos;s your mission to offer a product that they&apos;d want to eat outside, where your food truck is waiting.
 
Just wondering if you got any answers back on this?

Restaurant owners looking for additional sales see the mobile food truck as an opportunity to sell food without paying rent. Others see it as their way to enter the food business, hoping eventuall to open their own restaurant.
 
Hello there thanks for the heads up on the mobile business .I am starting up a mobile food truck in CA and it is getting very popular in my area now.. Yeah I know food business is one of the hardest business to do.My family and I used to own a Vietnamese restaurant and it was not easy the problems will never end and the high cost of over head was way to much for you to make a profit for your self .It felt like everyone was getting paid but you and you worked the hardest, but any way I learn a lot and this time I&apos;m not going to make the same mistakes..If you have any more tips it would be great..I will keep you posted on how I&apos;m doing if you wanted to know ..

good post ,, for those who are interested about his business ,,, truck must also consider.
 
Don&apos;t forget about your insurance you need it for your product and for your truck!  Especially if you are opting for the $60,000 truck! www.insurancedp.net
 
A food truck is like restaurant on wheels. It has several distinct advantages over a traditional eat-in restaurant.
 
You forgot to mention order and transaction technology... I&apos;m a regular at the food trucks serving downtown Seattle and sometimes they take credit cards, sometimes they don&apos;t. One of the trucks is using something called ordersm.com. It lets you order an pay with your smart phone.  Kind of cool but I&apos;m not seeing any mention of this issue in the article.
 
Great article and I like the fact they talk about being hungry or your passion for serving people quality food. I write alot on my blog talking about what are you passionate about and the fact that too frequently I hear in response to that – “Nothing”. Or “I really don’t know.”

Certainly you’ve met people who have a clear passion. They can’t wait to get up in the morning and get started on their work. They are eager, enthusiastic, understand their purpose and are committed to living it out. That kind of passion comes from knowing what you were born to do.

A Mobile food business is great idea for little investment. There are many vehicles for mobile food business but a medium truck is very helpful and reasonable in this business. A mobile food truck is a beautiful asset for everyone who interested the food business. This is a very suitable business to start if you have a love for cooking and like to work your own hours.
 
Great helpful info for starters in business! the fact that putting up even a small business requires lots of analysis, and to help you securing it also needs small business insurance. Just found this article with helpful tips for newbie entrepreneurs.  http://www.insuranceproviders.com/where-can-i-buy-small-business-insurance/
 
More tips and info, here:How To Open a Food Cart or Food Truck:http://www.themetropreneur.com/columbus/open-food-cart-food-truck/
 
What about insurance costs for the vehicle? If you think that $300 in miscellaneous costs will cover it, I&apos;d like to purchase my insurance from the same company. Then if one decides to affix their truck to a permanent location you will probably have to purchase additional insurance.
 
Also, if your business isn&apos;t related to food you can still use this idea; I recently saw a Double Tree Hotel food truck parked in Denver with representatives handing out stickers and warm cookies. Does it work? Well I enjoyed my cookie and two weeks later I&apos;m still thinking about their brand.

Hi There! This is Momogoose Food Truck (www.momogoose.com) from Boston, MA. As the first food truck in the country to have sold more than 2 million meals, we would like to contribute just a few additional thought to help a potential food truck survive beyond 6 months.
REGULATIONS : There are many cities where starting a food truck is essentially a non-starter.  Make sure to check with your local Inspectional Services and Health Department before going any further.SALES : Please consider the basic economics. price per unit x units sold per hour x hours per day.  Many &quot;gourmet trucks&quot; (from crepes to tacos to burgers to cupcakes) launch without considering their fulfillment speed. If you sell a burger for $5, but can only make 10 per hour at max speed, then you are only bringing in $50 per hour! Considering there are only so many rush hours per day...your sales may not be as astronomical as you hoped. You really only have 1.5 hours (max) for lunch rush and same for dinner. Your survival depends on your speed. Fancy gourmet sandwiches are great, but how fast can you make them?COSTS : To be realistic, a food truck that can generate income to support more than an owner/operator will cost you closer to $100,000. If you are doing any cooking, just the vent hood and generator to run it will cost $10k EACH. This is the same as if you were to put this equipment into a restaurant. If you are planning on operating in most major cities, you will be required to operate out of a commissary, so add rent on top of that. Suppose you want a permanent location (see location below), you may have to pay either public or private lot for that too. Then you have to pay employees for time spent moving to and fro locations (therefore not selling). The economics of food truck vs. a small restaurant may not be so different after all.  Not to mention a much higher maintenance and depreciation costs.LOCATION : If you are going to be tweeting and moving around then expect your total daily sales to be even LOWER. (Time spent driving is not spent selling!) Consider finding a good permanent location if your food would allow.TWITTER IS NOT A BUSINESS PLAN : Twitter is one way to bring in customers, but if this is the only way, then please think twice about your overall business/ marketing plan.LONG HOURS&amp;HARD WORK : I have yet to see a successful food truck operator finish her day before 12 hours.  In the winter, the day starts at 3am plowing snow getting your spot ready if you&apos;re in the East Coast. The amount of hard work can be much more than a restaurant. Consider a restaurant does not have to deal with mechanical breakdowns, vehicle issues, generators, propane tanks, traffic, and weather.WORK FOR ONE FIRST : Finally, we would really suggest future food truck owners work in an actual food truck before launching their own.  A successful food truck is an outlier not the norm. You will probably know whether you can stomach the hard work after a month of working in one.After careful economic planning, this may be the business for you. If so, welcome to our little family! We wish everyone best of luck! Do feel free to contact us if you have any questions.We look forward to hearing more thoughts from other operators around the country. Happy munchin&apos;Momogoosewww.momogoose.comtwitter @momogoose:disqus facebook.com/momogooseemail: info@momogoose:twitter.com
