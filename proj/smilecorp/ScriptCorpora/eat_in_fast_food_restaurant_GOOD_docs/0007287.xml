You can do what you want but I have my brides do their guest list first - you need to know how big a space you need before you decide where to look. You also need some type of budget as well. What is your vision for the day? [Permalink]

Places on a budget - try city park pavillions. Most have electrice&amp;bathrooms, trash service and parking. Most have good photo ops and a place for the kids to play. You can save money with catering a park theme. BBQ is usually affordable or family doable too. [Permalink]

I would suggest contacting your local country clubs in your local area or the area you have chosen to get married in. Most couuntry clubs are open to the public for receptions and in most cases have an onsite garden area for cerermonies. If you shop around enough I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find a venue within your price range. Most country clubs also include linen and chair covers in their price packages. I would suggest to stay away from hotel banquet rooms and offsite ceremony locations if you&apos;re on a budget, you don&apos;t need to be spending for transportation between those locations...

I hope this information was helpful.

Believe it or not a wedding on a yacht can bring down the price. With a yacht you need far less money on flowers and decorations and you have the added bonus of a captivated audience for 4 hours or so. You will be surprised at the cost for a wedding on a private luxury yacht that includes full dinner service and open bar.

Hello Kari,
We are an event planning company in Los Angeles. You may want to contact a few of your local Photography schools or colleges in your area for student photographers (not necessarily young kids...some are older students). You can request for samples of their work and usually most are building their portfolio. BUT remember you&apos;re not hiring professionals...you&apos;re concern is budget.

We hope this information was helpful. If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to contact us.

I started out by getting a book on budget weddings and going to going on DIY wedding sites. The very first thing I learned besides that there is a ton of helpful info at your library and online is that the biggest factors that effects budget is the number of guests you invite and location. I&apos;m only inviting 35 guests and I&apos;m visiting a winery on Tuesday. I&apos;m hopeful after talking to them that I will be able to get a beautiful and affordable venue for my small intimate wedding. [Permalink]

No idea on the location, as I&apos;m in PA. However, I wanted to let you know our idea. We&apos;re having a HUGE wedding (400-600 people guest list). We&apos;re having our wedding in the early afternoon, then taking a 3hr break between the wedding and reception. We are not serving dinner at the wedding (most boring part anyway), but the 3hr break allows for people to grab dinner wherever they like. We are only serving finger foods at the reception with the cake. Our money is being dumped into the fun and important stuff: open bar, photography/videography, dj, etc. [Permalink]

Dear Cheapest Wedding:
The first thing you should do is see if there are any landmark properties in your area. Sometimes an old library or museum or local Knights of Columbus and even some local churches would have party rental space. They are usually reasonable to rent and do work with food vendors that would save you money. For a price, you could just rent the space, and usually they have tables, a bar and/or stage set up for a dj or band. you just have to buy decor, get a caterer, a cake and can buy your own liquor and hire a bartender (very much recommended) or just serve a variety of wine beer and get decorative copper buckets and put old-fashioned soda pop bottles and glass beer bottles in them. think of your colors and theme. if you can&apos;t afford a caterer, see if you can get 10 famiy members to each make a tray or two of a particular dish. one can do baked chicken and veggies; another a rice and potatoe dish; another salad, garlic bread and appetizers. you can also buy party food at Costco or BJ&apos;s which sell in quantities: finger sandwiches, appetizers, sweets and the like. for accessories and decor, i love this site:
 www.orientaltrading.com 

for wedding invitations, this is the nicest and the most economical and you can get a &quot;send and seal&quot; invite which is lovely and economical without a separate reception card. They also have many other bridal accessories:

 http://www.annsbridalbargains.com/home.jsp 
do a search for wedding supplies you wish from these sites and you can get just about everything you need without breaking the bank. Have two or three of your friends as your designated photographers and later, you can order a wedding book at CVS, or another drug/variety store in your area. Here&apos;s my fav for great wedding attire:

good luck and give a call if you need further assistance.

I agree with Aboutthepix~you would first need to start with your guest list to determine what size space you will need, then depending on where you are from, you may want to just have a beautiful backyard wedding, rent chairs, a gazebo and have it catered (or someone cook). And to spice up you theme and thank your guest, purchase party favors at Flavor Your Favors - http://www.flavoryourfavors.com, they have an awesome array of party favors and gifts for any budget.

I would prefer a buffet style and I may be able to use a private home for th venue. This is taking place near the Manassas, VA area close to Upperville, VA.

I live in Winnipeg CANADA and am planning a cheap wedding. I have my flowers done in silk (excellent keepsake) they were done at Domenica&apos;s 1-204-885-3665. She also makes real flowers and does hairstyling. I am having my ceremony at he Assiniboine Park Conservatory. No need to purchase decorating since it holds all the plants and flowers but they only allow 30 people including your wedding party. It is very cheap venue to book. I am very lucky for connections as well. My reception is at my farm with catering (very casual) we own classic cars for transportation, my dress was from 7th ave fashions under $300 (depends on your style of course) I have my flower girls (four of them) dress hand made by a relative who is excellent with a sewing machine. My bridesmaid (only one) has bought her own dress and shoes. So far I have paid out just under $800.00 Still looking for a photographer but have a connection of a person just starting out. Some people have an amazing eye but I do stress if you can afford a professional if anything at all. I do still have a small handful of things to get done but all in all we are ready. [Permalink]

For any wedding, the first thing to discuss is what you like and dislike about weddings in general. Keep a list of each like and dislike and then build a new list of what you think would suit the two of you -not anyone else- . Once you have decided what you really want, you need to then establish how many people you want there, and then choose the location. [Permalink]

Use silk flower made at a florist (at least obtain a quote...usally quite a bit less costly)
Start visiting places like: Salvation Army and such as in the USA and purchase punch bowls and serving glassware at pennies on the dollar of cost or rental. Use for decorations and such. Turn one punch bowl upside down on another with a doilie between to hold punch or party favors hang the cups on the side for decorations. OR use the glass cups to sit at each setting to hold wedding party favors and / or the rice.....HOWEVER&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consider using bird seed as rice swells up in t birds stomach and either makes them ill or kills them and bird seed is good luck as well when thrown for the couple upon departing.
Use white sheets as table clothes. Tieing at the corners with same color as wedding ribbon to fit to the table size. These may also be found at places like the salvation army and such.

Actually, the priciest part of fresh flower arrangements and bouquets is the labor. Good silks will cost more than the fresh flowers. The cost savings is if you are using silk and DIY. [Permalink]

Great question! Some tips for a low budget wedding, you asked so here they are.
1. Keep your guest list down to bare minimum. If you haven&apos;t spoken to these people in more than a year they should not be on the guest list. Sometimes the most intimate weddings turn out to be the best. I recently had a destination wedding in Peoria, AZ, where everyone flew in from Milwaukee, WI. The guest list was a grand total of twenty people. They had a blast. You may check out the review I received on that wedding from www.weddingwire.com
2. There is nothing in the etiquette books that says you must feed the guests. You can simply have a cake and punch reception.
3. Consider having the event on a Sunday-Thursday. You can save 20% or more by going mid week. Also ask if vendors give military discounts, police&amp;firefighter or educators discounts.
4. Only spend money on the things you need, not necessarily the things you want. In other words what are the most important to you.
5. Don&apos;t waste money on knick-knacks or as I call it foo-foo.
6. If you must have food at the wedding that you are very budget minded, you can actually go to a local fast food restaurant and cater it in. Think about it. How much dressier can you dress up a piece of chicken without being charged $125.00 per plate.
7. Do not use an I-pod for your wedding. Entertainment is not the corner you should cut. You want people to have a great time. So do it right, hire a professional.

If you have any questions or need help searching for entertainment in your area eventective.com is a good start, or you may go to the National Association of Mobile Entertainers web site at www.nameentertainers.com.

I hope this helps!

First thing you need to do is to set an over-all budget and make a list of all that you expect to be included in your established budget. &quot;Undetermined&quot; is not a budget a service provider can work with. Put everything in perspective. Brides waste a lot of money purchasing miscellaneous items (silk flowers, plastic/paper plates, napkins with names on them, favors, candles (many venues do not allow them ... plus, if wax drips on table cloths, you can expect to be charged for replacement), confetti, bottles of bubbles, birdseeds, etc. Once you decide on the maximum dollars you will spend, select a venue. The word &quot;cheap&quot; appears a lot. Be aware that you get what you pay for in most instances and be aware that &quot;cheap&quot; normally &quot;looks cheap.&quot; A nice two-hour cake and punch reception following the ceremony is more economical (cheaper...but not cheap looking) and would give you better memories ... and a professional photographer would enhance those memories. Stretching that same budget to include a 5-hour event with food, beer and wine service means there will have to be thrift-store or catch-what-you-can-mismatched decorations, etc.; and free (pot-Luck)food included. With improper handling you could wind up with sick guests. Keep in mind that bacteria grows rapidly. Food brought to an event is often out of refrigeration or below 160 degrees more than 4 hours and that is where the hazard lies. My suggestion: Establish a realistic budget, operate from it by starting with professional assistance and &quot;free estimates&quot; ... include niceties but eliminate frills. And, please find another word as a replacement for &quot;cheap!&quot; Professionals are ready and willing to assist clients who are &quot;economical&quot; and even &quot;frugal&quot; ... but &quot;cheap,&quot; that&apos;s a whole different ball of wax! There is nothing wrong with a Pot Luck Reception but if you have one, you need to have someone knowledgeable of food over-seeing it ... and if that person is knowledgeable of &quot;presentation&quot; it is all the better. Simplicity in decor is normally less costly and in good taste. [Permalink]

The ipod thing is a REALLY bad idea!!!! My cousin did that at her wedding, and it was tacky and the music selection was awful! I advise to find a friend of a friend to dj if you really need to save money.... but trust me the ipod at the reception was horrible!! There were long stops because the playlists on the ipod had been played, and it was just bad....

the b.y.o.b is just tacky! Sorry to say, but the guest probably give you $50-$100 in a wedding gift, plus a bridal shower gift AND they have to pay for their own booze? No... that&apos;s not a good idea.... If your on a really tight bidget... Find a friend who was or knows a bartender, see if they want to make $50-$100 that night.... For the booze see if anyone in your family or anyone of your friends knows someone who is in the military they can buy the booze at the Post Exchange or Base Exchange on a Military base for half the price in the store AND they don&apos;t have to pay taxes... so you save about $200 alone in taxes.... Also a keg is a good idea for beer, bc a keg can produce up to about 150 full cups of beer. Just be sure to hide the keg behind the bar...

Alot of venues wont allow outside liquor, which means a keg or any liquor isn&apos;t allowed.. Sometimes the venue will SELL you a keg for almost double the price, Remember that selling liquor at the venue is how they make money... If I was to cut cost, I would provide champagne ,soda, and water to my quests and that&apos;s all... Let them buy their liquor. [Permalink]

Seems like everyone with a specialty thinks you should hire a proffesional of that specialty. MAYBE!
First, if you want to do it on the cheap, do it on an OFF day. 14Feb is Valentines Day. See what can be picked up cheaply for the 15th! How about the 5th of July? The Tuesday after Labor Day? Ya hearing me?
Booze! DO NOT have a BYOB event, or any event where someone doesn&apos;t have control of the alcohol. Unless you WANT your wedding to devolve into a Hilllbilly Slugfest, Hire a bartender!
The closer you are to Mother&apos;s Day and Valentine&apos;s Day, the more you will pay for flowers. (except for AFTER those days)
Want something cheap? Get married on New Year&apos;s DAY! Do it around Noon. Have a light lunch featuring 2 kinds of soup with salad and bread. Serve Wedding Cake as dessert with coffee and send them all home for a nice nap. [Permalink]

I would ask an event planner how much he or she would charge for an hour or so of answering your questions. They would know of venues that you could afford and perhaps for a minimal fee recommend vendors. There usually are a lot of good deals, and so many types of catering options available that the average person doesn&apos;t know about. An hour or two with a wedding coordinator will save you many hours of work. [Permalink]

The biggest thing in finding a place is how easy it is to work with the managers.

Also make sure you have a good idea on what is included and what are extras. The extras can cost a fortune. For example, lighting, table linens, decorations, use of the computer and projector and screen, parking attendants, security, etc.

Next of course is the &quot;look&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; of the venue. Some are cold, others warm, others historic, others are more like bars.

Different days cost differently. Saturdays are the most expensive, mid week the least. See if you can modify the date by a day or two and save a bundle!

Remember that the people who run the place make or brake the event! [Permalink]

Hey ladies, I had read a few posts so here is my two cents. If you live in a apartment complex many times you can rent out the club house for cheap and have the ceremony there, if not find a apartment complex that has a nice club house and most times they will let you rent it out for a day. I know a few of my complexes let us rent them out for like $50 bucks a day. Also silk flowers for your flowers, and for the photographer just use disposable cameras. You would be suprised how many great pics you can have because of what your friends and family take. If not, find a friend who can stick around and take specific pics so that you have those pics as a back up if your friends didn&apos;t take any good ones with the disposibles. [Permalink]

I a planning my daughter&apos;s wedding. With 30-50 guests, you could hold it at any of your favorite restaurants who have a banquet room for much less than renting a country club or even a Hall. Or you can rent a hall, spend money on decorations and bring in food from your favorite restaurants (instead of a caterer). At any venue, make sure you know when their curfew is - in many places you have to be out by 10 or 11 pm, so if you want to party on to early in the morning, your search will include the curfew.

Disposable cameras are good. We may use some for our wedding. I found a friend who does photography as a hobby. He&apos;s charging us $200 for everything, plus he&apos;s traveling over an hour to attend. We&apos;re not doing anything fancy. He&apos;s doing about 400 shots for the ceremony&amp;reception combined and is going to upload them to a CD with a digital wedding book. The suggestion I saw earlier about finding a photography intern or someone fresh out of school is a good idea too. But if you know someone good with a digital camera who can upload everything to their computer, they can put something on a CD for you too and it could save you a ton of money. I&apos;ve seen wedding packages as expensive as $4800 for 6 hours here in FL. [Permalink]

I have looked on several websites, but I initially started with weddingwire.com. I am planning my own wedding and this has all the tools you could possibly need. You can do a search for wedding venues in your area and submit requests for quotes. I&apos;ve also found venues right here on eventective, but those venues seem to be a little more costly. I have found that if you find a local restaurant that has a banquet room, you often will pay for the meal for each of your guests, but they don&apos;t charge to hold the event there. In lots of cases, especially chain restaurants, they will assign you a certain number of wait staff based on the number of your guests. You generally pay an 18% gratuity. You could also call ahead and ask to speak to a manager. Sometimes that&apos;s the best route, so they can plan for your party. They will usually give you plenty of time the night before or the morning of to decorate. [Permalink]

 If you live in a state that has a beach. Everyone dress for a beach wedding. The water is free,the sand is free. And everyone can wear flip-flops. 

This is true. That&apos;s basically what we had in mind, but the oil spill could be an issue soon. However, there are lots of places around FL in Pasco, Pinellas, Hernando&amp;Hillsborough counties where you can have waterfront without the issue of the oil spill killing the idea of a beach wedding. Marinas, restaurants, hotels and parks with waterfront property are all cost effective places to hold a ceremony&amp;reception. Restaurants right on the beach are great if they have the space for your wedding party. They usually have live music and can save you the cost of a DJ or live band if they play the kind of music you&apos;re looking for. If you&apos;re willing to pay a little more money, there are lots of places that will set up and clean up your beach ceremony and will include the officiant. Some even include photography, videography, etc.

Another idea for an outside wedding ceremony is to have one on a cruise ship. If you&apos;re working with a budget of $4000 or less and a limited number of guests, you can do a ship ceremony before you set sail on your honeymoon. They include the cake and everything and you can do it for about $2000 or so. They have a wedding planner that helps you with everything. Carnival Cruise Lines is a great place to start, but I know other cruise lines offer it as well. Some captains will marry you at sea. It just depends on the cruise line.

Hope this helped and good luck with your search! [Permalink]

I looked here on eventective and it looks like there are several ceremony&amp;reception venues to choose from. I think typical restaurants would be more affordable, because you generally just pay for the food, not the site. Another option is to pay only for yourselves and your main guests, like the wedding party and your parents. If everyone else pays for their own meal, you can significantly reduce the cost. If you want to pay for everyone&apos;s meal, this type of venue can be more affordable. You can always contact the restaurant manager and see if they have menu items you can set up as a buffet style to reduce the cost per person. If you want something a little fancier, just look under &quot;find a venue&quot;, choose your state, then your city. It will give you a list of places to look at.

HI. Hopefully you got some ideas on getting started, but in case you did not. Set your budget. That is the most important and next create 2 lists...must have and would like, but can do without then you can start finding what you want (venue, photographer etc.).

You can google for wedding planning checklist for things to consider or if you go to my site, you can download one. www.desertlightweddings.com 

If you can afford it, talk to a planner in your area. Many offer just guidance to get you started all the way to full planning.

Hope this helps.

My husband and I did not have a &quot;wedding&quot; the first time around almost 10 years ago, sooooooooo we have decided to renew our vows in Oct 2011. My issue is finding an affordable place that will have enough room for about 300 guests, a DJ, our Buffet Tables, the Cake, Gift Table and room for a dance floor and NOT have everyone sitting on top of one another. I am looking at this realistically and I am NOT one of the brides from &quot;Platinum Brides&quot;, we do NOT have 75,000 to spend on just flowers or food. We would like an elegant ceremony, a fun reception and NOT go into debt planning it. Any suggestions for a Reception Venue in Statesboro, GA? Please and thank you and I pray that you all have the weddings of your dreams and long and happy marriages. God Bless. [Permalink]

Personally, i would check out more affordable hotels like Holiday Inn, Ramada Inn, etc. Most of them have private meeting areas that can be used for your wedding. In some places, like here in FL, they have really nice areas outside where you can have your ceremony too. They can offer group pricing to accomodate your out-of-town guests. [Permalink]

Turn one punch bowl upside down on another with a doilie between to hold punch or party favors hang the cups on the side for decorations. OR use the glass cups to sit at each setting to hold wedding party favors and / or the rice.....HOWEVER&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consider using bird seed as rice swells up in t birds stomach and either makes them ill or kills them and bird seed is good luck as well when thrown for the couple upon departing.
Use white sheets as table clothes. Tieing at the corners with same color as wedding ribbon to fit to the table size. These may also be found at places like the salvation army and such.

Where are you going on your honeymoon? Perhaps a destination wedding would do the trick. Or perhaps you could do a cruise wedding. You can everything done for you for about $2K. You can bring your guests onboard for a ceremony&amp;reception and then set sail for your honeymoon. They also have more elaborate things you can do and still stay at the $5K range. They provide everything, even your attire if you want. [Permalink]

Destination weddings on the beach are really nice too, but I think the cruise would be more affordable. But certainly look into both if you want an outside venue.

We found a restaurant down here called Catches Waterfront Bar&amp;Grille that&apos;s doing our ceremony&amp;reception both. They have a beautiful balcony with a waterfront view. We&apos;re having our ceremony there. Then there&apos;s a semi-private room that leads out to the balcony, so everyone just walks inside for the reception. And it&apos;s a covered balcony. It&apos;s $600 minimum, no site fee, and includes the tablecloths, napkins and everything. It&apos;s about $7/person and the menu includes sliced beef, basa fish, spinach puffs, raspberry&amp;brie, bacon-wrapped scallops, plus some other sides and bread. So the food is about $350, plus the cost of drinks and such. But very affordable. I went to Ross and got my dress for $20 and the maid of honor&apos;s dress for $10. I got one flower girl dress @ Beall&apos;s Outlet for $8 and the other @ Burlington Coat Factory for $20. I got all my flowers, vases, stones, baskets, candles and bubbles at the Dollar Tree for less than $150 and am doing my own arrangements. So depending on how much you want to do yourself, you can save a bundle. My budget is $3000, but I&apos;m trying to do it for $2000. Most of our vendors are gifting their services to us or gave us a great rate because they do it as a hobby. DJ $60/hr + tip, Photographer $200 and Videographer for free. I used Pingg.com and did electronic save-the-dates, invitations and thank you cards. We got our wedding bands on clearance at Littman Jewelers and paid less than $900 for the bands, care plan&amp;tax. I currently work for the court system and got a judge to do my ceremony and he won&apos;t let me pay him. So far, things are really coming together for our wedding.

I hope this helped give you some ideas for your own. June is very difficult to book because it&apos;s a popular wedding month. I&apos;m going to do a search on here and see if I can come up with any other venue ideas for you. [Permalink]

I did a search for Cortland, NY. Not sure if any of these places will work for you or not, but check these out. Let me know if you need me to look further for you. I pulled all this information off Wedding Wire, but I&apos;m sure we can find more on other sites. Some of these might be too expensive. If they don&apos;t provide the information on the website, that&apos;s a pretty good indication. But some of the others looked reasonable and within your price range. It just depends on whether the location will work for you or not.

 I did a search for Cortland, NY. Not sure if any of these places will work for you or not, but check these out. Let me know if you need me to look further for you. I pulled all this information off Wedding Wire, but I&apos;m sure we can find more on other sites. Some of these might be too expensive. If they don&apos;t provide the information on the website, that&apos;s a pretty good indication. But some of the others looked reasonable and within your price range. It just depends on whether the location will work for you or not. Thank you so much! I have not had time to blog because of work, and too tired to even get on line. We are now talking about having july 4th weekend of next year.

I was afraid of that. Hathaway House was the one I thought looked promising. I&apos;m not surprised that Holiday Inn was so expensive after I saw the gazebo they had outside. It was very nice. I&apos;ll keep looking for you and see what I can find this week. I&apos;ll post something next weekend. If I were you, if you find the place you want and can&apos;t get it for that date, maybe you should consider changing the date to the 24th or 26th since you want a summer wedding. Saturdays in June are probably going to be the toughest to book anywhere. Figure out what the most important point of your day is and work from there. That way the most important things will reflect the memories you have of your special day. [Permalink]

RE:Holiday Inn or any other facility Many places list Wedding prices as well as Banquet prices. They will usually work with you off of the Banquet menu. It&apos;s usually fewer courses of food and doesn&apos;t include open bar. BTW, we&apos;ve been told by many that cash bar costs less than open bar because most people don&apos;t drink enough to make the flat fee for open bar worth while. [Permalink]

you can have a cheap wedding if only u get married ona friday or sunday, but u can bring cost down , by buying local flowers, and others. i got maried in 2007. i had 125 guest in Leonard&apos;s, www. ladolcevita.com , it was on a sunday . we planned on spending $10.000, ended spending $20.000. i planned my own wedding it took me a year, from my dress to the reception, no help from anyone. i bought flowers in seasons, visited 8 local ones. i order my party favors online , i got 350 for $99. formal dinner is less expensive than buffet style. my friend had buffet style dinner, before she walk down to the reception site food were almost gone, she had to pay an extra 2500. trust me on this. if u cannot afford getting married wait t&apos;il u can because it is frustrating to have large sums of bills after ur union. thanks GoD for my parents, [Permalink]

Find a photography student at your local or closest college. They usually do a great job and will work for less than professionals. You might even get lucky and find one for free, just so they can add to their portfolio. [Permalink]

I am getting married Oct 16,2010 and still have not found a photographer or caterer in my price range. I live in Marietta Ga and we are getting married in Clarkston, GA. Catering quotes I have received are $25 and up per person and that&apos;s only heavy hors dourves. I was hoping to pay $10-12 per person for a buffet. I&apos;m only having 50-60 people. I thought this would make it more affordable, so far it&apos;s still just out of reach. I am also looking for a photographer in the price range of about $150-200. He can just take the pics, edit them and give them to me on a disc. I can make the prints and wedding album myself. Any one have any ideas or other places for me to look? thanks for your assistance [Permalink]

In all honesty no wedding photographer can provide you any coverage of your wedding for $150-200. That is unrealistic. If that is all you have, then your best to go to a Studio and have a portrait session. Buy prints later. We charge $150 -200 for basic portrait shoots, as I am sure you will find most PROFESSIONAL photographers do. Pros feed their families with their work, just as you feed yours with your work.

Photo students do not get training in wedding photography. I have taught college level courses. The emphasis is on technical aspects and art. Wedding photographers get training by working with other pros as apprentices . Some also have had training through organizations such as the Professional Photographers of America and Canada. There used to be a school in Winona Indiana for just that purpose. Sadly, I believe it is now gone.

The suggestion to get a photo student is often put forward in these discussions. They have absolutely no training in the pressures and protocol involved in wedding photography.They likely would not even have the proper equipment.You would be better served to contact the local camera club and view portfolios of the senior members, although I suspect if they are any good they too will charge realistic prices. If you want good, professional photography you simply can not cut corners. [Permalink]

I&apos;m not a photographer, but I have to agree with you. I have seen the results of over 200 weddings and the difference in quality is striking. If capturing the wedding in high quality photos is important to a bride and groom, but they have a limited budget they really need to consider other ways to cut costs. The photographer only has once chance to capture the day. If they aren&apos;t spot on, the couple is left with disappointing photos for the rest of their lives. [Permalink]

Here in Ocala, FL the Townsquare Gazebo is FREE!! (provided that the town does not have it booked for an event). It looks great in photos and I&apos;ve done more there than I can remember!

Casual weddings are “IN”. The object is for everyone to be comfortable and enjoy the day. The bride and groom are dressed up, but sometimes not formal. The guests are expected to arrive in dressy but casual attire. The buffet is finger foods, drinks are ice cold and the music is fun. Guests enjoy the wedding because they’re much more relaxed. These are typically outdoor ceremonies, but that’s not the rule.

A link to a photo of the Ocala&apos;s downtown gazebo is on my website at http://www.oursimpleceremony.com/Venue.html Enjoy your wedding!! [Permalink]

that is extremely reasonable. the average per plate meal, buffet or otherise is about $50 per person. so, $50 x 100 = 5,000. There wuld be more variety of food, but much more than your price. So, you are ahead of the game. Ask for a &quot;tasting&quot; Be sure you like the food before you commit and sign a contract. If you don&apos;t like it, then you keep looking. Good luck! [Permalink]

you can start by purchasing wedding magazines in your town. also, look at your yellow pages under &quot;catering&quot; or &quot;banquet halls&quot;. you should also look for YMCA&apos;s, Knights of Columbus and other organizations who have rental halls, which are cheaper than regular party spaces.

I put up white christmas lights and ribbon and paper bells from party city on the cealing for the food we bought only the main dish which was pork and we cooked our side dishes ...for our wine bottle i bought lace ribbon and decotated it and our wine glasses it all turned out very fancy looking and it was all for under 1000 dollars..

If you are looking for inexpensive food for the wedding, consider Italian or Spanish. I have a restaurant in Exeter, NH (Lanzo&apos;s Bistro) and when doing catering, I can tell you that as a caterer we have a lot more wiggle room to bring the prices down when the focus isn&apos;t on the meat/seafood but rather breads, salads and pasta. I have been doing very very nice Italian lunches with salads, breads, desserts, multiple entrees for $10 -12 per person.

We just had a small outdoor post wedding event on our outdoor patio for $19.00 per person. For that price we served mussells marinara, fried calamari, cheese bread, salads, steak tips/roasted vegetables, chicken ziti broccoli, eggplant parmesan and penne with meatballs + dessert. (3 appetizers and 4 entrees plus salad, drinks included and dessert). They raved about the food and the family style presentation. They brought home lots of leftovers! Better yet - they loved that we are BYOB. I recoomend this type of menu, family style for small 20-40 people parties. It was very reasonably priced and everybody was very happy. I think people actually prefer family style to buffet because they don&apos;t have to get up and wait on line. Its also very difficult for some people to juggle their plates (kids especially) and walk carefully.

Just some ideas. I have more if you need cheap food ideas. Contact me at lanzosbistro.com [Permalink]

For local vendor ideas, I suggest you check out the wedding showcases in your area. I&apos;m from Nova Scotia, and the best ones to go to are the one at the World Trade Centre (Brides 2011), the one at the Cunard Centre, and visit the Welcome Wagon website for a show in your area. (Google the venue names for current information)

These shows are where costly and inexpensive vendors alike come to show their wares. If you google it, you&apos;ll find there&apos;s about one a month somewhere in the province with the exception of the summer months. [Permalink]

We have about 8 colleges near the INDY area...and when one of my brides/grooms is a little short on cash, we hit the art(s) department of the universities. You can also hit the ENGLISH department - believe it or not - as Journalism majors often overlap into photography minors. Also, the GRAPHIC ARTISTS if you have a computer - related school! If you can get a hold of their professor, and they will approve it as a grade-able assignment, sometimes you can get it for FREE or just printing fees! Then you should remember to TIP WELL if you get a student...you remember how hard it was getting by back in school - right? Hope this helps! If you have any additional questions, feel free to call me at 317-490-7984. This is my personal mobile and I will try to steer you in the right direction if I can!

 We just went up on our budget from $5,000 to $10,000. We want to spend half that on the wedding and the other half on the honeymoon. We got the venue for $2,000. My second wedding dress for the same price as my first. DJ is my fiance&apos;s brother. I&apos;m having a flower girl and a ring bearer and my maid of honor. Plus wedding favors and gifts for our attendants. Is it going to be duable with a $10,000 wedding budget? 

ok wedding favors and gifts for your gest could just be one of a same, at least thats what i did, centerpieces for the tables did u also include them in the 10,000? the photogrpher? between the veneu,pictures,favors it should not go over the 10,000 you just need to shope around and spend time the computer looking for bargains 

Hi there!
It seems you are dealing with the same issue as most...money is tight...and weddings are expensive! To try to help address the issues at hand though...I have some suggestions as where you can try to save some money!
1st, Centerpieces&amp;Cake... IF you don&apos;t want to spend a lot on this area but you want everyone to get cake and have a centerpiece on the table, you can simply order cupcakes, use cupcake stands, and then place the cupcakes on the stands into a large box that appears to be a present. The present has a removable top - so no unwrapping is necessary. At time for cake cutting, have a small 2 tier cake at a cake cutting table. Cut then have this served to the wedding party and parents only. Have the oldest couple at each table &quot;open&quot; the box on their table. Now you only paid for cupcakes, stands, a box, pretty wrapping, and had a little fun...and you still got your photo opp for cutting and toasting.
2nd, FAVORS... around that centerpiece &quot;box&quot; order small 1 oz candles and wrap them in tiny boxes. Everyone opens their own box and gets a custom colored/scented candle that will burn 8-10 hours. (call me to order if interested as I do get a bulk rate on this item and can save you some money). So everyone opens a present - what fun! For kids, simply fill their box with little candies. For Attendants, instead of the 1 oz candle, order the larger ones that will match the guests ones....VERY AFFORDABLE yet special. They even make a wedding cake scented one. On the parent tables, have floral arrangements with candles - denoting this is a special table for those closest to the two of you.
Please feel free to call my personal mobile at 317-490-7894 to ask questions or get more tips. Suz (www.studiobrides.com) [Permalink]

For the booze see if anyone in your family or anyone of your friends knows someone who is in the military they can buy the booze at the Post Exchange or Base Exchange on a Military base for half the price in the store AND they don&apos;t have to pay taxes... so you save about $200 alone in taxes.... Also a keg is a good idea for beer, bc a keg can produce up to about 150 full cups of beer. Just be sure to hide the keg behind the bar...

This is a very good reason to use a planner for your wedding. They would know the laws in your area. In mine, it is illegal to serve alcohol without proper insurance and an event liquor licence. Getting arrested on your wedding night is never in the best interest of your marriage! Besides, being your own bartender, paying the additional insurance, and having to buy a liquor licence can cost more than you think. You don&apos;t &quot;have to have&quot; liquor at your wedding....consider having a teetotal wedding or making &quot;mocktails&quot;. Give mini bottles of wine to guests as a take-away. Have a donation bin at the bar, so guests don&apos;t have to pay, but they can. Or have a cut-off level at the bar (ie offer drink tickets). That way you&apos;re giving them one or two for free, and after that, they&apos;re on their own. It may be good etiquette to offer an open bar, but you don&apos;t have to get your guests falling down drunk! (that&apos;s usually counter-productive ) [Permalink]

Buy out our date at Tannenbaum Events Center, July 30, 2011. Reno, NV

Event includes exclusive use of the facility for a day (inside and outside). The Tannenbaum facility rental includes room set up for up to 170-200 guests, round tables, inside banquet chairs and white, ivory or black table linens. You can use a caterer of your choice or arrange to bring your own food. You are not required to have a bartender or pay any charges for having a bar. The events center can suggest other vendors that are familiar with the venue. My rental also includes exclusive use of the bridal suite with dressing rooms for both bride and groom. The venue has great flexibility and doesn’t have additional hidden charges. I can send you the pricing break down for additional rentals.


Prime Saturday summer date at a discount. Look online and see that the date cost $3,750 for the site rental, plus the additional cost of renting the bridal suite. I will sell you my date for $3,250 including the bridal suite. Save more than $500 by using my date. Our plans have changed and we are stuck in a contract.

Check out their website at tannenbaumevents.com or their facebook http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Reno-NV/Tannenbaum-An-Alpine-Event-Center/132059313498?ref=ts&amp;__a=6&amp;ajaxpipe;=1

Ok, here are some suggestions after reading thru these posts:
1) my shower was a hall that cost $175 w/use of the kitchen. Could be decorated well enough for a wedding. Alcohol is cheap, or bring your own to serve.
2) A friend joked that the theme of my wedding should be &quot;I bought it on ebay.&quot; Check etsy.com and amazon, too. Jewelry, shawl, decorations. I&apos;ve seen some beautiful silk bridal bouquets, too. The $1 store is great for decore.
3)Costco has great prices on food and alcohol. You could probably cater the whole wedding yourself with the choices. Restaurants shop there. And their store brand (Kirkland) is quality you can trust. Their own booze is award winning.
4)We found a little city park right next door to our reception...by doing a search of the area on google earth. It&apos;s free w/ a refundable cleaning deposit.
5) Invitations-buy card stock paper at Staples, Walmart, etc. They sell envelopes, too. Make your RSVP cards as postcards (less postage). Some simple scrapbooking punches to fancy them up. Search on google/msn/yahoo for Images that match your theme. Cut and Paste one on the invitations at the top, side, or bottom. (I bought beautiful kits @ Michaels on clearance, 50 for $20)
6)for the few kids we invited, I&apos;ve been picking up $1 items here and there to put together bags of activities for each one.
7) Check with a local high school or college for vocational programs where students may cater, create your flowers or provide music for your event. (especially the wedding above in Brooklyn. Cuz you&apos;re not getting married cheap there.)
8) Local grocery stores usually do a fantastic job on flowers at a fraction of what a florist charges.
9) I posted my favors previously: foil wrapped chocolate hearts from a local and well loved candy factory.
10) Do you know someone with a vintage car who will transport you (maybe you pay the gas)? Anyone can rent a limo, but old cars are special and great for photographs.
11) Restaurants/banquet halls often list prices for Wedding Packages with several courses, plus alcohol and cake. Noone eats all that food. Ask if they can work from their regular banquet menu. About 1/2 as much per person. You MAY be able to bring a cake.
12) Several restaurant friends have told us not to do &quot;open bar&quot; at a fixed cost per person. Rarely do people drink enough make it worthwhile. We are doing an open bar with a set limit. IF they spend our limit, it will become a cash bar. Excellent way to budget, and you only pay for what is actually served.
13) OK, this is crazy, but the 2 poods are going on our honeymoon. It&apos;s cheaper than a dog sitting service. It was HIS idea. He&apos;s sooo the right man for me. [Permalink]

If you want good pictures of your wedding but dont have the money, find someone who is good at taking pictures and that has a DSLR camera and your golden.

The Knot website is your friend. Plug in the cities/towns locations you wish to hold your wedding and it will give you links to places in that area. If that doesn&apos;t help, call the convention&amp;visitors bureau for the city/town where you would like to be married. Very often they have a staff person dedicated to the wedding/family reunion market. They can usually give you a list of inexpensive places such as public parks. [Permalink]

If you are not opposed to church reception halls, they are usually going have the cheapest rates so far as venue. A lot of people think that they can&apos;t have dancing and/or secular music because they are using a church hall, but it is the complete opposite (speaking for churches that I book at in Roanoke, VA). If you are not using an event planner (which I don&apos;t suggest) then it is good to have some idea as to what you would need to make your event successful and entertaining to your guest. I always suggest that even if you are not going to go through some ritzy hotel, still meet with the event/wedding coordinator for the hotels and conference centers in your area because they will have GREAT IDEAS and NICE PACKETS packed with Ideas and room set ups that can come in handy when you are working with the bare bones of &quot;just and event space&quot;. Good Luck and Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!! [Permalink]

Allot of you have questions on finding a photographer or good music. Several years ago when I got married, I went to the local college and talked with professors who taught photography. They had a lot of students who were graduating who do this quite often. They then charged me $10 per roll of film taken and then only for what I had developed. Very inexpensive. I did the same for my music by going to the music department and I got a harpist and a flute for a few bucks. We got married in a park and the music was fabulous! [Permalink]

 Yes, I am renewing my vows on Febuary 11, 2012. I am having a problem to where to have the wedding. We are going to have about 100 people. I need help please. We only have a buget of $5,000.00. I am stuck. We live in Frederick, Maryland. 

Dear Friend from Maryland:

I have family in Gaithersburg and we do parties all the time. Don&apos;t bang your head against the wall! I can help you plan it if you wish and can do some checking for you. Since you are having 100 guests or below, your budget is not impossible. I do recommend a Sunday event which can save money. Many places are open but slow on Sunday and they offer great spaces and catering and you can save about 30-35 percent. You can have something in one of the local smaller hotels, I bet, and do a simple ceremony at the site (if you are not having a church or temple renewal ceremony) and then a lovely buffet brunch.

Let me know if I can be of service. I go to Maryland every couple of months and can meet with you to discuss details after I&apos;ve researched some locations.

Do call me or email me. I give three complimentary email and phone consultations, so don&apos;t worry about any cost to me now. My rates are very reasonable and I can put together a package that would include my research, your invites&amp;thank yous for your wedding and a basic photography package.

Check out my sites.

All the best and congrats!!!

My friend is getting married, and we don&apos;t have a big budget (I&apos;m Maid of Honor). For my senior pictures in high school, I went to a friend&apos;s mother who did professional photography as a hobby at night after her day job. My advice would be to talk to someone like that and see how much they charge/hour or whatever but also how much/picture. By going to her and not some Hassel n Funk place or anywhere else, we saved a LOT of money on my senior pictures. So in short - my idea is to look up a neighborhood friend or someone close by who likes to do photography as a hobby. But before you hire them, take a look at their work and also what they can do to edit pictures.

For cheap photography, do look into photography schools. many students who are advanced would welcome the chance to shoot a wedding at little cost to you. you may not get the best pix in town, but for the price, you will still get enough to make your daughter happy.

for cheap venues, i recommend halls such as Knights of Columbus, YWCA/YMCAs, American Legion, Veteran halls and the like. there may be also some non-profit organizations in your area whereby you can give a donation for a room. you need to search your area or go to a real estate office who will have a map of naples, or whereever you reside and help you find these sorts of places. you may want to try a public park or a lakeside public space to have your ceremony. you usually only have to give a donation.

good luck to all.

Best,
Lise

Dear Sara

Dear Friends:

For inexpensive venues, I would do a search in your area for the following:

Eagles
Elks
Lions
VFW
Grange halls
Knights of Columbus
WYCA/WMCA

They may only ask for a donation and usually have a kitchen, air conditioning, tables and chairs, and a coat room.

Check your local phone book or stop by a neighborhood real estate office who should have a map of your area and all public access locations.

Also keep in mind that many catering venues offer up to 1/2 off for an evening weekday party (like wednesday or thursday) or a sunday afternoon event. You get the same treatment, but since the economy is bad and the venues want the business, they offer it at much cheaper prices.

I&apos;m in NYC, which is by far the most expensive place, and was able to find venues with full buffets, non-alcoholic drinks for as low as $25 per person (and beautiful rooms to boot).

for wedding supplies an decor, check out:

orientaltrading.com

for wedding invitations, this is the nicest and the most economical and you can get a &quot;send and seal&quot; invite which is lovely and economical without a separate reception card. They also have many other bridal accessories:

 http://www.annsbridalbargains.com/home.jsp 
do a search for wedding supplies you wish from these sites and you can get just about everything you need without breaking the bank. Have two or three of your friends as your designated photographers and later, you can order a wedding book at CVS, or another drug/variety store in your area. Here&apos;s my fav for great wedding attire:

good luck and give a call if you need further assistance.

 Am looking for a cheap but decent and nice hall to have my wedding at. Am from Texas but having it in Brooklyn, NY. Please let me know of and good ones thanks. 

Dear Sweetangolic:

There are some good locations in Brooklyn, but depending on what deal you get from your caterer, you may wind up paying the same rate for a place that has everything already.

Keep in mind, when you rent just a raw space you will need to provide: table ware, cloths, decor, flowers, in some cases, a dance floor; you need to bring your own food or hire a caterer and dj and bartender, plus the liquor, of course.

I live in NYC and know of a few good places off the beaten path. I can think of one great place in the Bronx that you would love for around $35 per person with a sumptuous buffet. However, if you insist on Brooklyn, I do have some resources.

Email or call me.

You should consider a sunday afternoon party which would probably be a lot less expensive. You can serve wine, beer and softdrinks and as well, have a buffet rather than a sit-down. They provide a host of services and have a good reputation.

If you need a reputable NY/NJ photographer, do contact me. If you sign a contract by April 1, 2011, I will give you a 35% discount off our premium packages, a wedding album and thank you cards.

The cheapest you will find will be about $15-20 per person. In my opinnion $800 for 100 is a great price! Thats about $8 a person, thats hard to beat. You&apos;d spend more buying everyone McDonald&apos;s. The only thing cheaper would be to make the food yourself.

Hello Folks, I make sugar flowers and will customize a topper or arrangement for your even that is easy to add to your basic cake. It gives you an upscale look without the upscale price of having your bakery provide them. Only the most expensive bakeries have staff with the talent to make these and it is a very time consuming proccess. If you are interested, please email me a galtie@yahoo.com for more information.

I just started planning our wedding for next May, and I have found so far that a great way to save on flowers is going to be to just use roses and order them bulk...by the box of 100is about $100. Super easy to make into bouquets as well as just a couple in vases and bowls are really pretty for the reception with some candles. [Permalink]

Delaneysmom,
do also purchase mixed rose petals so that you could sprinkle them on the tables and on the escort table. If you are walking down on an aisle runner, sprinkle them on that as well. You can also have some of your guest toss petals on you and your groom just after the ceremony when you walk down the aisle or leaving your ceremony venue. This makes for great shots. Good luck!

Use silk flowers, dollar store mixed with nicer ones from, ex. JoAnn&apos;s Fabrics. Use the internet for tutorials from florists on how to make your own bouquets, boutineers, table arrangements, etc. Buy decos on ebay. Have a pay as you go bar. Don&apos;t scrimp on the photographer. If you are going to surprise guests with a bust-out move on your first dance, make sure someone videos it! Assign one special person to check details if you cannot afford a coordinator. Let HER be your go-to person (an aunt, cousin, roommate, etc,. but not anyone in the bridal party or immediate family). We made, arranged, painted, shopped online, and did everything we could think of to save money. We chose a one-stop venue that provided everthing we needed. [Permalink]

Dear friend: don&apos;t know what your budget is but do check out the following links. keep in mind if you do a sunday brunch or a thursday nite event, you will get a very good deal. for sunday, you can get away with serving beer and wine and have a champagne toast. you don&apos;t need hard liquor and you can do a &quot;brunch&quot; sit down with buffet service. i do not think last minute is the worry since you are marrying off season and most of these places should have some kind of space for a wedding ceremony. good luck!

I would agree that if you are on a budget and a have a friend who understands photography and they can take good pictures then go with them. But you need to realize that photography is a work of art, that is also very unique in that your are often capturing a fleeting moment. Yes anyone can click a button or even a use a timer for that manner, but your not going to get that amazing photograph. Its just not going to happen unless by total fluke, and do you really want to look back at that wedding photograph of you and sigh wishing that that dork new how to use his camera?

Elements like making the subject &quot;pop&quot; and finding that perspective that just makes you smile every time you look at the photograph as its so touching. These are not things that you can just do with a camera unless you have some experience. Another quality people don&apos;t understand is the &quot;deer in the head lights&quot; look, which is because when you throw a full flash at your beautiful bride you get a horrible glare with shadows in the wrong places. Using a flash is a way painting with a light, you need to understand how it works to make the best use of it.

And that is just the camera, you also need to understand people, and learn the dynamics of the wedding party and guests because that is what you are trying to capture. So can you throw a handful of cameras out and get pictures, yes. Can you just snap away and get pictures, yes. But you are not going to get a story of your wedding day that you will want to cherish.

I think if you are mixing the words cheap and wedding you are already flirting with disappointment. Rather approach your wedding with modesty in both the guest list, as many others suggest, the venue and the reception you plan. If money is a real issue then make it a dry wedding or a ba\r with donations so the guests know to help pay for the bar tab which can often be more than the food.

For the food, you should go with a modest menu, regardless of who caters it but stick with some good basics finger foods rather than arranging a sit down affair or large buffet.

If you would like some suggestions for modest menus then please do write us at info@partychef.ca. You can also look up our website at www.partychef.ca for menu ideas.

We wish you the best and most wonderful weddings and remember to thing modest budget rather than doing it on the cheap. [Permalink]

How much was your last lunch at McDonalds,Subway,your local sandwich shop.Mine was 7-8 dollars and it was cold. As a full time caterer that puts out a good product, I can&apos;t put out a hot buffet dinner using quality ingredients that you and your guests will enjoy for less then $10.00 per person and I&apos;m not getting rich off that. Especially after your Uncle Billy thinks it&apos;s a Country Cookin&apos; All He Can Eat buffet. Remember I have to pay the city,county,state and the feds their cut too. Your Aunt Rita doesn&apos;t. There&apos;s low budget, then there&apos;s mission impossible. [Permalink]

Kay,
I agree. $10 per person usually gets one only low quality appetizers at best.

For people who can&apos;t afford a caterer, you should really cook and have family members contribute to the menu as well. There&apos;s where you will save money. However, it&apos;s a lot more work, and you&apos;ll have to buy all your table settings, serving dishes, sternos, utensils, etc. etc. etc. A caterer usually provides these things and incorporates everything in their price. If you want a decent buffet you should prepare on paying about $20-30 per person, depending on the cost of each dish (remember that carved meats, seafood and exotic dishes are more expensive). $800 for 100 people is pretty reasonable where I come from.

Good luck to all! [Permalink]

Dear Friend,

Don&apos;t know what your budget is, but here are some tips:

* do have a sunday or thursday evening event if possible. you can save up to 40% off
* do have your guest count and determine your colors/theme/style
* do tell them &quot;you&apos;re not sure&quot; of when you will have the wedding say something like &quot;Maybe in late May.&quot; Sometimes their calendars are not filled up and they will contact you a few weeks beforehand and offer up to 50% off your cost.

Here&apos;s my fav picks:

 http://www.cateringbyuptown.com/celebrationsatthebay/weddings/ 

 http://www.chesapeakebeachresortspa.com/wedding-info.htm 

They work with vendors and can do a package with a dj/florist

I am a photographer and go to Maryland all the time (have family out there) and can give you a $2500 package which would include:
*two photographers
*Casual but elegant beach themed wedding invites (100)
*2 sign in posters for guests (comes with matching pen)
*welcome banner for either ceremony or reception
*100 thank yous
*100 menus
*100 favor magnets with your image
*You&apos;d get over 200 photos on CD color corrected and print ready
*a custom 8x11 album with over 70 photos, 21 pages telling the story of your day. Will match your colors and theme in design and all of your materials can have your image on it.

Give a call or send an email if you have questions. My initial phone/email consultation is free.

Good luck and all the best!

We&apos;re getting married Aug 2011. Our ideal wedding is just a big party with all our friends and family present, dancing into the evening. The problem is, finding a venue! We&apos;re open to traveling anywhere in Washington state. Any suggestions since we don&apos;t have relatives with property to loan us for the evening? We&apos;re from the western part of the state, so if it&apos;s over here we&apos;re planning ~200 guests... if held in eastern Washington it would probably drop to 100 or so. Our budget is $5000. Any advice is MUCH appreciated. [Permalink]

A good way to reduce costs as I`ve found out i s to have a cocktail reception instead of a traditional sit-down-dinner. The key is to have your reception in a garden, small museum, or art gallery of some sort so the venue also takes part in keeping your guests entertained.
Remember to have a couple of sitting areas for the elderly, the pregnant, and those with heels that kill.
Now all you need to do is contact a caterer in your area and negotiate a number of bites and beverages within your budget. [Permalink]

Dear Friend,

Check around. You may be surprised to find a professional who would be willing to do say, your ceremony for about $500. They will shoot a lot of film, give you a cd and you can make prints later. Find out if they do any photo enhancement. For your reception, I would designate a friend who already has a camera, to do your photography. He/she can take the usual family/bridal party shots, dance shots, shots of you and your groom at each table and beauty shots of just the two of you at your venue or outside, depending on your schedule of events.

You may also contact a local photography school and ask if an advanced student would be willing to shoot your wedding. You can give them a couple of hundred bucks and feed them in exchange and agree that your images could be used for their own portfolio.

good luck!

 If you are going to skimp on anything, DO NOT SKIMP on entertainment. 

It&apos;s a fact that the musical entertainment is the MOST important part of your event. Whether it&apos;s a band or DJ, this is the part that EVERYONE remembers.
Sure it&apos;s nice to have a good photographer, good food, and a great venue. But the guests remember HOW GOOD they feel once they leave.
If you have a great DJ, if they love the music, and if their feet are sore at the end of the night, THAT&apos;S what they remember.

One bad DJ or band will absolutely RUIN your entire event no matter how good the cake, the food, or the venue is.

Any hall that you are going to rent will most likely charge you a rental fee for the use of the hall. The fee covers the liablity insurance the hall needs to carry while you and your guests enjoy the facility. What often adds up in the budget is the incidentals that families do not think about that add to a do it your self wedding. Many articles have been written comparing the cost of doing it yourself vs hiring the professionals to provide the emenities for the wedding. In fact the price differential is often less than a few hundred dollars. Remember this is the most memorable day of your life and the biggest regret is that trying to do it yourself while trying to save a few pennies takes away from the overall magic of the day. I would be glad to share with you some of the common mistakes and how to avoid them just drop me a note....jerry@mainediscjockey.com

Hi Guest from Providence RI,
I&apos;m also from Providence. I would recommend you check out Colt State Park in Bristol RI. It is right on Route 114... so take 95 to 195. Take the Route 114 exit off of 195. You&apos;ll drive through East Providence, Barrington and Warren prior to reaching Bristol. Once you see Seabra Supermarket, a traffic light and a fire station on the left Colt Park will be on the right at the next light. They have a nice outdoor chapel, a covered eating area, etc. It is very nice. A lot of wedding photographers do pictures in Colt Park. On occasion you will also see a couple, a minister and a handful of family members gathering by the water and doing their wedding. If you do your wedding just a bit earlier you will also have cherry blossoms, azalea and/or lilacs in part of the park. The park office is right in the park so you could check with them re: reservations, etc.

Please feel free to contact me directly via my EvenTective listing if I can be of further help to you.

Posting my previous post again for those on a budget who have not read through all of the mails. Good luck on your event.

Like, I mentioned above, for inexpensive venues, I would do a search in your area for the following:

Eagles
Elks
Lions
VFW
Grange halls
Knights of Columbus
WYCA/WMCA

They may only ask for a donation and usually have a kitchen, air conditioning, tables and chairs, and a coat room.

Check your local phone book or stop by a neighborhood real estate office who should have a map of your area and all public access locations. By far these are cheaper than a catering venue. You may also want to do an outdoor ceremony, so check with your local parks. Determine your style and the kinds of colors you would like to use.

For ideas, you should buy the popular wedding magazines. For sites and vendors, it is worthwhile to purchase, &quot;Wedding Sites and Services&quot;. You may also want to visit David&apos;s Bridal or a wedding store in your area. You can pick the colors you would like for your bridal party.

Once upon a time, the father of the bride paid for everything, including the bridemaid dresses, rental of tuxes etc. These days a lot of couples are funding their own weddings. But be careful people -- you could spend as much as a house payment and just on one day. I&apos;m all for smaller groups, and maybe at a friend&apos;s or relative&apos;s farm or a parent&apos;s home if parge enough and a good grassy area. Tents, catering, etc all add up but paring the list is the best way to go. Know how many people you want to invite, don&apos;t feel guilty about not inviting people to the reception although you have invited them to the wedding itself. People understand when you say we just have to watch the pennies. Just don&apos;t go overboard. [Permalink]

Actually, the guest are required to pay for their own flight. If you are able and willing to pay for a few of them, that&apos;s fine, but it&apos;s really up to them. That&apos;s the reason you&apos;re suppose to send &quot;Save the Date&quot; cards in order to give them time to take advantage of travel deals.

My daughter just got married this weekend and after being in the wedding video business for over 30 years I never relized just how important our job is. We walked her down the aisle and were last down. Missed everything before us but got to watch and hear everything in our video. I believe the video is more important than the posed pictures, so folks, don&apos;t go too cheap on the video , make sure they are licensed and insured and not just some guy working out their house. Now our family will relive the day over and over. If anyone wants to see pictures from video contact me at maury@videoyou.com [Permalink]

 Save alot of money, you could do silk flowers. 1/2 the price of having real flowers. 

I am getting married Aug 20, 2011.... I am saving money by making all the wedding flowers. I bought alot of red yellow, and white roses for $1.00 cdn each bunch at Wal-Mart, before I moved from Winnipeg to Powell River BC. I also bought a bolt of Tuelling from Michaels craft store for my mom&apos;s wedding and have loads of it left for my wedding. I just made sure I left a lot of the stem on so I can add it on others and make it bushier. I am also making my own centre pieces by going to a local Dollar store (discount store), buying tea lights, votives, using shells my daughters collected from the beach.

I did find a local bakery who is willing to make the cakes and desserts and also let us use her fountain cake stand for a very reasonable price. The cake top I found a place also in Winnipeg, who makes beautiful handblown glass!

Our dinner is going tobe buffet style, with some local flare. I have a few places making a couple of the dishes PLUS also doing a lot of the prep work myself for the meal will cut down alot of the costs.

the photographer and dj are both friends of my fiancee, so if you have friends and family that can do it or knows of people who can, they can help you with it as well. Talk to many people and get IDEAS from them, jot them down and them investigate..... as for the invitations and favors.... get a goup of gfs together and make a night or two out of it...... take a favorite picture of the two of you and make your own invitations and favors.

In Manitoba we have wedding socials where we can make money for the wedding. [Permalink]

Find a photographer who charges for their time, not prints or albums. Many photographers will bill you an hourly rate, and then burn all the raw images onto a disk or stick and give them to you. [Permalink]

 So far everything has been totally over the budget. I normally wouldnt mind its just that we have a baby on the way and have to save money for her as well. I also dont have a job. The reception hall that i found is nice and it only cost $600 to rent out. the problem is that the food will cost me $1900 for 75 guests. Should i make guests pay for their meals or find some place else? 

Dear Friend:

It is inappropriate to ask your guests to pay for food.

However, since you are renting a hall, you can ask your close family members to help you with catering. Appoint five or six people to each make a large tray of a tasty dish. One could bring and chicken and rice dish. Another could bring a lasagne or a pasta dish. Another could make BBQ chicken wings. Another could bring a vegetable dish, like sliced squash, broccoli, carrots and peas in a white wine butter sauce along with a few dozen dinner rolls. Another could bring crudite and dip (assorted raw veggies with dipping sauce) and another could bring &quot;pot stickers&quot; (asian dumplings that come with a tasty plum or soy sauce). All of these things can be purchased in food warehouses such as &quot;Costco&quot; or &quot;BJs Warehouse.&quot; Ask them in lieu of a gift, that if they make the meal and buy the sterno for their dish, that would go a long way to making your wedding successful (and tasty with a homemade flair). If you cook, make your own favorite dish, and you could get sternos at any 99 cents store.

What I would do is have your caterer bring in appetizers, such as spring rolls, mini quiches, pizzas, mini burgers, mini portions of mac and cheese and mini danishes and cookies. This could run about $900 or so for about 75 -100 people. You could save a lot by just catering appetizers and buy a nice sheet cake, wedding style from a local baker or order it from Costco as well. For flowers, I would get small potted flowering plants from Home Depot (they run about $10-20 apiece). Appoint a friend to take your photos or call a local photography school and ask if a student would be willing to shoot your wedding for about $200. They can give you a CD of photos and you can print them out later and make your own photo album.

For wedding favors and inexpensive invites, there are many do it yourself projects. You could also do a search on the internet for Ann&apos;s Wedding Bargains. They have &quot;Send and Seal&quot; invites which look great. Also log onto orientaltrading.com. Do a search for weddings. They have great trinkets for cheap prices.

Good luck! All the best to you and your family.

Sincerely,

Lise&apos; Ramos

Try the visual arts department of some of your local colleges/universities. There are students with excellent photography skills, and if they can produce a portfolio of some of their work, you can see the quality before hiring them for a non-professional rate [Permalink]

Hi Guest in Providence,

I&apos;m also in Providence.

If you are looking for a beautiful outdoor location I would suggest the Chapel and nearby covered reception area at Colt Park in Bristol RI. It is a beautiful place. Many wedding photographers bring their wedding parties to the park to take both engagement and wedding photos. High School seniors take senior photos in the park.

If I can be of further help, feel free to contact me directly through my Eventective Listing.

I forgot there is a great hall in Penndel, Penndel Fire Hall that has a beautiful hall with a full kitchen and separate bar area with the beer meisters for kegs to be put in if you choose to do alcohol. The kitchen is a little out-dated, but is still very nice. The fee, if I remember correctly is $350 and you need to be out, including clean-up, no later than midnight.

Great space though that has been newly remodeled. Only downfall is that the bathrooms, while absolutely forgeous, are on the second Floor.

Try searching for VFW and Tall Cedars lodges. If you have a direct connection with them, you can also try a Masonic lodge. Although the Tall Cedars are part of the Masonic family, they have more flexible rules as to who can rent from them.

Another option is, depending on your guest count, using your own yard or that of someone you know. You may also have a specific local home that intrigues you and you, and this is a longshot - but I have seen it work, might ask the owners if you could rent from them directly.

If you need any other ideas, feek free to contact me. [Permalink]

Congratulations! Google your city and state for catering and banquet halls, you will have several places pop up. Phone several of the venues and have your list of questions ready. If they take the time to answer your questions, willing to provide information to help you, have some suggestions, then by all means stop by the venue to tour it. If they do not have the time for you on the phone and brush you off go to the next venue on the list and do not waste your time to visit them. Hope this helps you.

I can help you with your wedding. Be aware that Valentine&apos;s day may be quite expensive since it considered a major holiday event in the U.S. However, if you really want it that day and are open to several options, and depending on your budget, it is doable.

First, it&apos;s important to get the following information:

* # of guests
* location? where are you? City and State.
* Do you want a Valentine&apos;s day theme?
* If not, what colors?
* Dj? Photographer? Videographer? Band? MC?
* Who is paying for the wedding?

Send me an email and I can at least get you started. No charge for the first email.

Good luck and congratulations!

Hi T Nickerson,
I&apos;m also in Rhode Island (Providence). I would recommend you check out Colt State Park in Bristol RI. It is right on Route 114... so take 95 to 195. Take the Route 114 exit off of 195. You&apos;ll drive through East Providence, Barrington and Warren prior to reaching Bristol. Once you see Seabra Supermarket, a traffic light and a fire station on the left Colt Park will be on the right at the next light. They have a nice outdoor chapel, a covered eating area, etc. It is very nice. A lot of wedding photographers do pictures in Colt Park. On occasion you will also see a couple, a minister and a handful of family members gathering by the water and doing their wedding. If you do your wedding just a bit earlier you will also have cherry blossoms, azalea and/or lilacs in part of the park. The park office is right in the park so you could check with them re: reservations, etc.

Please feel free to contact me directly via my EvenTective listing if I can be of further help to you.

When my daughter got married, we wanted to do a inexpensive but elegant wedding and reception. Instead of having dinner for everyone, we did a dessert reception only. There was a 2 hour break between the ceremony and the reception so the bridal party went out for dinner (the grooms parents actually paid that bill) then we went to the reception. I did get a break on the wedding cake because I know how to decorate cakes and had a friend who also did help me with that. We also made a variety of cheesecakes ahead of time and cut food grade paper with fancy scissors to put each piece on and borrowed pretty dishes to place them on. Some of our friends volunteered to make additional desserts. The table and wedding cake were beautiful and the whole reception was a hit!! We had over 300 guests. Everything we did for the whole event was inexpensive and the wedding with dress, flowers, decorations, deserts, plates, etc. was around $3,000. You can have a beautiful wedding and reception for a low cost. Patricia An Affair of the Heart Colorado Springs [Permalink]

For all of you brides-to-be, let me give you some quick advice.
**First - the longer your engagement, most likely the more expensive the wedding!

Determine what your &apos;absolutes&apos; are and go from there....in other words, you can&apos;t have it all if you don&apos;t have the big budget - however, if you can do without some things in order to have what you REALLY want, you&apos;ll be so much happier!
Example: A bride has to have certain roses or flowers, and lots of them...but doesn&apos;t care as much about the party food....then that is where you make the cuts/changes....The trend right now is small bites, so this bride could go with a few small food items, or cocktail food, and satisfy her guests.

**Second - Alcohol is the single most expensive item (next to food and a dress!) that a bride will have to budget for. Who says you have to do an &apos;open bar&apos;? Kick it up a notch and do what&apos;s really cool right now, and offer a &apos;signature&apos; drink, instead! If you have a &apos;theme&apos; going for your wedding, choose something that will go with it. Offer a self-serve &apos;Beer Bar&apos;, purchase the booze yourself (cans are cheapest), have friends help ice it in color-coordinated buckets or tubs from Wal-mart or a discount store, and your groom&apos;s beer-drinking buddies will be thrilled!

Do the same with a &apos;signature&apos; drink station....Set up a separate table with &apos;help yourself&apos; plastic &apos;highball&apos; cups, ice buckets, pitchers of Margaritas or Pina Coladas that you&apos;ve made the day before and kept frozen (they&apos;ll thaw and be slushy by the time you say &apos;I Do!&apos;) and put out colorful, inexpensive little party umbrellas for the guests to add to their cup---OR--- set up tubs of ice filled with bottles of wine and plastic wine glasses, a couple of corkscrews, cocktail napkins and let the guests serve themselves. You&apos;ll save on liquor costs, as well as bartending fees! And for one night, Suzy Q can do without her Rum and Coke! And when the booze is gone - it&apos;s gone! Or allow someone else to make a &apos;beer run&apos; if you need more....just don&apos;t feel obligated to offer alcohol ALL NIGHT....they don&apos;t expect it, and certainly don&apos;t need it!

**Finally, as far as a location is concerned...Know how many people you want and what your needs are and it should simplify your choices. Why not think &apos;out of the box&apos; and have your reception at a beautiful local park, or outdoor venue, like your best friend&apos;s backyard? Usually the city only asks for a small fee to use the city parks, and if you can find one that already has picnic tables, then you&apos;ve got your built-in drink stations! (Just cover with a nice tablecloth first!) You can rent chairs or even a metal arch that you covered with grapevine and tucked in a few flowers, and it will look great!

Hope some of this is helpful...Just remember, it&apos;s YOUR wedding, not your friends or your mother&apos;s.....and as good as they might be, YOU (and the groom) get to make the final choices! Don&apos;t stress...Enjoy!

Good luck and Cheers!

I LOVE Nashville! You&apos;ve got an incredible number of venues in Nashville, it should be a competitive market, ...and somewhat more affordable!
First, check my earlier post below regarding this......But also, consider a non-profit venue, such as a museum (like the Frist), or a public place like the Union Train Station (with 350 guests, who&apos;s going to notice a hotel guest in the mix?)..You&apos;ve got TONS of very cool parks, and historic places, (such as the Sunnyside House in Sevier Park on Granny White Pike).

Also, there is a fabulous Bridal Show in Nashville, coming up in February (I went last year)......you might also, make a point to go check it out ($5 or $10 at the door) and see what is new and different...they also do some great giveaways for girls engaged,such as photography packages!

I am amazed reading these posts - everything seems so CHEAP compared to what we have been looking at! We&apos;re planning to wed in Sedona, AZ, and WHAT a rip-off - every venue we&apos;ve looked at is at least $2,000 just to walk in the door - no tables, chairs, food, booze, NTOHING! We only have 50 guests and it looks like we&apos;ll spend 5 - 10K - and I see here people are doing 350 for $2 grand - what the heck! [Permalink]

Dear Friend,

Perhaps a party venue/ hall is not the way to go in Sedona, which is a beautiful, but expensive area. What about surrounding towns? I do a lot of wedding planning in the New York City area, which is quite expensive, but am able to find good deals. Think of it this way - because if you choose a catering hall that has everything already. Believe it or not, paying a higher per person charge without the hassle of bringing everything in is worth the extra few bucks. sometimes it comes out cheaper since you won&apos;t have to rent your tables, table settings, etc. Here&apos;s my tips:




-- a sunday afternoon affair is cheaper (you can get a better deal very often because sundays are slower for venues)

-- my last wedding couple changed their date to a thursday evening. they had a 7pm to 11pm event - dinner, cocktails, the works for 50% off. the same event would have been $200 per person on a saturday night. They paid only $100. They planned earlier so that people could take the next day or part of the day off. They only had to pay for their flowers. The catering venue provided everything.

-- you should try a smaller hotel for these off days - they are eager to fill their party on a sunday afternoon and can give a nice cocktail hour and buffet for a reasonable price.

-- also, if you get married at the height of wedding season, you will pay more. try off season, when it may be a bit colder.

-- you can also do a saturday or sunday luncheon/brunch and save a lot of cash. this is good for those on a budget. you serve only a champagne toast and then a variety of wine and beer. no need for heavy alcohol during day hours and you could save in excess of $20 per person! many better quality restaurants will work with you. check around and see if you can find one with a party room or is willing to give you the whole restaurant on an off period.

-- another trick to to call a venue 6 to 8 weeks before your wedding. tell them that you decided last minute to get married and you are not set on a particular date. They would cut you a deal for these sorts of last-minute affairs since they want to get as much business as possible. Of course, this takes a bit of faith and tenacity, and you should have an officiant who is flexible. But you can get a great deal with all the trimmings if you do this.




You should fill out the Eventective EventAgent. Vendors will contact you if you put your budget and are flexible with the dates.




Hope this helps!




Best,

That&apos;s a tough one. I have not read all the posts here so have no idea where or what the people are getting for $2K for 350 guests. As you are finding out, Sedona is a very popular place to get married here in AZ. No wonder since it is so beautiful.. When are you getting married? If not in the winter time, have you considered having your ceremony outside say at Cathedral Rock? (see www.az1photo.com click preview, Erin&amp;Derek) With 50 guests it would not be too difficult to coordinate that and then you could check a local hotel for a banquet room (some will do the room discounted or no cost and you pay for the catering).

If you decide you would consider Phoenix, there are a ton of gorgeous venues and many are reasonably priced/including your set up.

Just some ideas.

Thanks Robbie - we are doing an outdoor ceremony. We&apos;ve checked a lot of the popular hotel venues. Enchantment is $3500 for 2 hours on the patio (no setup) plus they want $1500 for a room inside (in case it rains. Please. This is AZ, not Florida!) Los Abrigados is $1700 for the creekside, plus $500 setup fee, plus tables and chairs, plus bar setup fee, plus, plus, plus... Dancing Apache Ranch is $3,000 for a night just for thevenue (which does come with 5 bedrooms - but still.... pretty rustic.) Amarra, L&apos;Auberge, Poco Diablo are all in line with those prices - and the really get you on food costs of $50/person minimum. I&apos;m ready to elope! [Permalink]

I agree! I live in Hampton Roads in Virginia and I am trying to stay within my budget of $6000 or less and I am afraid that I am going to go over. I have not found a venue yet because I am working for the most part but this weekend is going to be calls on top of calls. I am determined to find an acceptible venue to get married and have a reception in for a decent amount of money. I have found a sufficient place for rentals in case I need tables and the such so that there are no surprises! It&apos;s possible to find cost effective things. You just have to slow down, take a deep breath, and search for different bargains. Sometimes if you compare the company to a similar one that is offering the same services, the companies will knock prices down just to stay in competition because at the end of the day, the company wants revenue. Good luck and best wishes!! [Permalink]

 Like, I mentioned above, for inexpensive venues, I would do a search in your area for the following:

Eagles
Elks
Lions
VFW
Grange halls
Knights of Columbus
WYCA/WMCA

They may only ask for a donation and usually have a kitchen, air conditioning, tables and chairs, and a coat room. You should also check community centers, universities, fire stations, police athletic league, art galleries and old theaters.

Check your local phone book or stop by a neighborhood real estate office who should have a map of your area and all public access locations. By far these are cheaper than a catering venue. You may also want to do an outdoor ceremony, so check with your local parks. Determine your style and the kinds of colors you would like to use. 
 
 

 Sometimes catering halls offer better rates during off months (when it&apos;s a bit colder) and if you have our affair on a Sunday afternoon or Thursday night, you can save as much as 40%. Also, you can call a venue about two months before your wedding and tell them you are not sure when you are having your dates, and ask if they are having a last minute special since you are not locked into any specific date, but are flexible to say get married between april and may. they do want to fill their space as often as possible and may give you an extremely good deal.

For ideas, you should buy the popular wedding magazines. For sites and vendors, it is worthwhile to purchase, &quot;Wedding Sites and Services&quot;. You may also want to visit David&apos;s Bridal or a wedding store in your area. You can pick the colors you would like for your bridal party.

Weeknights are a better deal sometimes a 1/4 of the cost, Fridays and Sundays run cheaper than Saturday nights. One of the things we do for customers is take a cheap ugly place and transform the room with lighting and pipe and drape can make an ugly cheap place look beautiful and expensive for a lot less than the more expensive places. Find a company that does multiple services they are often less expensive than getting different companies to do each part. Also try to find a place that lets you bring in your own alcohol if you are going to serve any the mark up can be very high on liquor.
Good Luck,
Kimberly

There are some great ideas here but the one that I agree with is your invitations can be seal and send which are quite economical. I have a wide selection of seal and send invitations at great prices. I highly discourage people to make their own invitations. They are really not economical when you consider the paper, time and INK. Also, many printers will not feed the thicker paper and I have a printer that will, but has started smudging in the corners. You don&apos;t want that. Also, if they get wet, they will most likely smudge.

Please visit my website and contact me. You will not be sorry. Visit www.invitationsbydeborah,com. The seal and sends that I recommend are in the McPherson&apos;s album on my site.

I also agree with the point about the guests. When planning our party, the food bill was the greatest amount.

Have a wonderful day! I hope to hear from you.

That&apos;s actually an excellent price! If you chose a served/plated dinner, your price would be double that. Look at it this way, if you break it down, $800 for 100 people is only $8/person. I don&apos;t know that you can possibly find anything cheaper than that, unless you went to KFC.

One of the sweetest weddings I ever saw was when my husband and I went to an Old Country Buffet for dinner (back when they still had one long buffet line). A wedding party with about 25 people came in, filed through the buffet line with Dad at the end picking up the tab, and then were seated at a long table right in the middle of the restaurant. They had balloons, somebody brought in a wedding cake, there were presents, and everybody had the most wonderful time!

I&apos;m not suggesting you go this route, but I brought it up to show that you don&apos;t need a country club wedding with a $50k price tag to have a lovely wedding with beautiful memories. [Permalink]

The difficulty we have is our venue location - Sedona - is kind of a wedding mecca. So everyone charges up the wazoo for everything up there. I have tried numerous private homes for rent and they have all said we would only be allowed to have as many people as the home could sleep - no parties - forbidden by the HOAs. And I agree, $800 for 100 people is a screaming deal! We are looking at barbeque buffet with NO set up (we have to provide plates etc.) and the least we can get it is about $15/head for a min of 50.

 Guest Posted on: Dec 4, 2010 at 5:46 PM 
Think outside the box a little and do something different from the &quot;norm&quot;. Have your wedding in the late morning and serve a brunch buffet -- sausage and bacon is cheaper than beef and chicken! Or have your wedding mid-afternoon and serve High Tea. Another option is to have your wedding early evening and just have a dessert reception -- of course, be sure to call it that on your invitation so your guests know to eat beforehand.

If you still want to serve a full meal, you also don&apos;t have to stick with a &quot;caterer&quot; -- alot of restaurants and even warehouse stores have party trays you can get for much less than what a professional caterer charges.

If you do something different than what everybody else does, people will actually remember YOUR wedding. [Permalink]

Check with you local parks, many of them allow you to perform a ceremony for a small fee. Also you can do a simple reception at a local restaurant. Pictures can be taken by guests or hire the photographer for just the ceremony. All of these items make for a very inexpensive wedding. [Permalink]

Kcucinel, I don&apos;t think a restaurant is the way to go - a buffet is likely cheaper, esp. if we can bring our own alcohol. Dining out I would expect to pay a minimm of $20 - 30 per head. Add in drinks at $5 - 10/each and figure 2 - 3 per guest over the course of the evening.... we are having the ceremony outdoors, though. [Permalink]

A restaurant may offer a buffet in their private party room -- that&apos;s how we did it when we got married. Also, ask if they&apos;ll run a &quot;tab bar&quot; where they run a tab that you pay at the end of the event, instead of where you pay a set amount per guest for an open bar. That way you only pay for what is actually consumed. It usually ends up being cheaper. [Permalink]

Where are you located? When is the wedding? Approx. How many guests? There are many planners on this site, but we can only help you if you provide us with basic information.

A great way to save money on your hall is to use a VFW or Tall Cedars Lodge. Tall Cedars is part of the Masonic organization, but is less restrictive about who uses their sites. If you have a Mason in your immediate family, then, by all means contact the local Masonic Lodge. In my experience, the lodges are inexpensive to rent, but places like the Masonic Homes in Elizabethtown, PA are very expensive considering you can only have a ceremony there, and only if you have a mason in your direct family.

I hope this helps! [Permalink]

Hi Jehn2006,
I would suggest that you start by reading the following posting by Reverend Ann Fuller who frequently monitors these forums: http://www.eventective.com/forum/topic1410-ideas-for-inexpensive-venues.aspx to find a venue. Once you read it over and begin to do some of the items on the list come back with specific questions as there are a number of people including Rev Fuller, myself, and a number of planners here who would be pleased to help. Also, think about whether you wish to hire a planner, who you would like to have officiate, what type of reception you would like to have, and whether you would like to hire a professional photographer (highly recommended) and videographer. Bring your questions back here... and I&apos;m sure you will receive lots of great feedback.

Dear jehn2006,

I am getting a gown there and I live in Massachusetts. Just sit write everything you want and you will get all together quick I prominse you [Permalink]

These can be a fun way to get candids of your reception, and a very low cost alternative to hiring a professioal photographer for the reception. However, here are several pointers if you choose to use these cameras:

Be sure to have a little note by the camera with instructions as to what you want people to do with them. Do you want them to take pictures of each other at the table? The events at your reception (bouquet toss, garter toss, cake cutting, first dance, etc.)? And be sure to mention to leave the camera on the table and that someone will pick it up.

Be sure to assign someone to pick them all up at the end of your reception.

Be sure to get the kind that have a built-in flash.

Be sure to get fresh ones. We used these at the 50th anniversary party we threw for my in-laws, and about half of them produced some very poor quality photos because the film was old and the internal batteries didn&apos;t have much power.

If you choose to use these instead of a professional photographer at your reception, try to have a friend or relative that&apos;s good with a camera around taking photos, too. You want to make sure you get the shots you want.

 Photographer Alternatives 

Wedding photography is a special skill. Most people who are very talented with a camera simply don&apos;t have the skill to properly photograph a wedding. Indeed, through the years I have met a number of people who take excellent photos with excellent equipment who will not touch a wedding.

 One Possibly Acceptable Alternative 

The only alternative to a professional photographer which I could possibly recommend for a wedding in which one invests in an expensive bridal gown, flowers, etc, etc is to contact a local university and see if there is an advanced photography student (or two) who has wedding experience who might enjoy doing your wedding. If you go this route be sure to look through the students work, be sure you like it, and be sure they have redundant equipment with them. You might also contact a local photography club for some ideas about talented photographers who might be willing to meet your budget needs.

 Friends 

Friends with photo experience and good cameras are great. They can take nice supplemental photos. They can also take photos at events like Bridal Showers, etc.

 Supplemental Cameras -- Consider Digital Not Disposable 

If you would like to supplement your professional photos and your friend&apos;s photos with cameras on each table you might get some interesting photos. I&apos;ve never been really happy with the quality of photos taken with disposable cameras. A better option which does not cost a lot more is to buy relatively inexpensive digital cameras when they are on sale for each table along with extra batteries. (The only risk is that they could walk away...) Paste a label on each one with your name, address, phone, etc and have instructions nearby. You will get much better quality photos for not a lot more money. Best yet, you&apos;ll have the cameras after the wedding. If, say, 3 friends with weddings in the same year decide to share these in addition to better quality the cost would probably be less than the disposables and you would each have a few nearly new cameras left over after the wedding.

It depends on what you expect for pictures. A pro will give you more consistency with better images you can be proud of later. It&apos;ll make all the difference in the world. Wedding photography is not easy! I can&apos;t stress that enough. It&apos;s &quot;combat&quot; photography; terrible noon lighting, it&apos;s hot, folks don;t know where to go or what to do. A pro can pull all this together for you leaving you to enjoy your day. Uncle Bob with his new prosumer camera means well, but I&apos;ve never heard of it working out. If you want to save money though and STILL have a pro shooter cover your wedding, place disposable point and shoots at the reception. What they can do is pretty well what anybody can do in a dark room where everyone is dancing. You&apos;ll get a lot of silly shots, unusable shots, slightly drunk shots and somewhere in there you&apos;ll also get a few &quot;gold&quot; shots. Hope this was helpful! [Permalink]

Hi Dan2008,
You really think the disposables do as good a job as say a 5 meg digital with display?
Wedding photography is difficult... but I think it is a different art than combat photography.

 Guest Posted on: Jan 6, 2011 at 5:36 PM 
Well Dr.Ron...disposable point and shoot cameras come with flash and they are still film so they surpass 5mp. It&apos;s the photographer, not the equipment though. As for my comparison to wedding/combat photography. No photographer would plan a wedding at high sun. At every turn a photographer is faced with contrasty elements. Fill flash works, but is limiting. Just saying wedding photography is one of the more demanding jobs. If it was up to a photographer the wedding would happen either on an overcast day (for gentle difused light) or when the sun isn&apos;t so high in the sky. So if it&apos;s cloudy or raining on your special day - [Permalink]

Hi Yinpep,
You are in a very high cost of living area... Thus, everything will be very expensive.
I&apos;m confident you&apos;ve read all of the postings about checking universities, parks, etc. Thus I won&apos;t repeat them. I&apos;ll just suggest that you check out the Rose Park in Berkeley. It is very nice. I&apos;ve seen weddings there. I don&apos;t know the exact location, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be able to find it by asking some local people. Also, check out UC Berkley. What would they be willing to rent to you at low cost? You might talk with some people there in the chaplain&apos;s office or student activities about some of the venues their students may use.
Check with the school to see if they have a photography department. I don&apos;t know if they do or not, but if they do talk with them about some of their advanced students.
You might also check out Golden Gate Park. See if you could have your wedding in one of their beautiful gardens.

Hi Dan208,
I agree with you on the lighting being really tough at mid-day and that the person taking the photo has more of an impact than the equipment. I&apos;d like to see a side by side comparison of pictures taken with the cheap disposable camera lens and a for example Kodak 5MP camera. I&apos;m expecting the Kodak 5MP would be better because of the cheap disposable lens in the one time use camera... Ron [Permalink]

Hi Ashdiggles 26,
I checked Google and it brought me to a number of places including the Gathering Guide listing of 19 places in Hartford. One which sounded good was the Bushnell center for the Performing Arts. Have You checked them out? If not here is a link to their page: http://www.gatheringguide.com/event_directory/ct_connecticut/event_venue_1089.html and anther one was the Hartford Society Room http://www.hartfordsocietyroom.com . Why don&apos;t you check with these two places for starters... and if they seem too expensive ask whomever you speak with in sales if they have recommendations. My next suggestion would be to check religous institutions, and it is a bit of a drive but I&apos;d next check aroind the UCONN Campus in Storres. Let me know if I can be of further help.

Dear Guest Hacienda Style in L.A.



You must check out Mariposas at the Hacienda Hotel. It is beautiful and you will need a minimum of decor because it is already set in a Mexican elegant Hacienda style. Because the hotel is nearer to the airport, it is cheaper and there will be ample parking. Keep in mind that if you do a Sunday brunch wedding reception, it will be much cheaper, and you could have a champagne brunch with a variety of wines and skip the hard liquor since it is an earlier affair -- that saves a lot of money since an open bar is usually $20&amp;up per person alone. I don&apos;t know how many guests you are expecting, but call the hotel directly and ask to be connected to this or one of the other restaurants. Here is the site:




 http://haciendahotel.com/el-segundo-restaurants/mariposas/index.cfm 




If you need invites, wedding favors, sign in posters and other printed goodies, I offer a package starting at $200 for up to 100 guests.

You can email me at liseramos@msn.com for the details.




Good luck on your wedding plans!

I&apos;m a wedding musician (solo violin&amp;trio/quartet) so I&apos;ve played a lot of weddings of all budgets---my best advice for a low-budget wedding is to 1) use lots of reliable volunteer help (sew your own dresses, make decorations, cook your own food) and 2) locate both the ceremony and reception at a church--there are indeed many that are not &quot;preachy&quot;, for example the Unitarian Universalist tolerate nearly every belief system. Most houses of worship will have some type of fellowship hall or gathering space, and will allow you to bring in your own food. Yes there are some churches that have stricter requirements, just keep searching for one that isn&apos;t so picky. Also you&apos;ll likely not have rigid time restrictions either, so you can have your family show up extra early to do your own decorations. You may have to hire their janitors (or maybe not), and purchase Event Insurance for $100-$200, but the savings you&apos;ll realize by doing your own decoration&amp;food will easily cover that. For the music---unless you have a relative who is REALLY GOOD, of course, I would suggest you go with a professional, who will be happy to work for in the $200 range. [Permalink]

 Posting my previous post again for those on a budget who have not read through all of the mails. Good luck on your event.

Like, I mentioned above, for inexpensive venues, I would do a search in your area for the following:

Eagles
Elks
Lions
VFW
Grange halls
Knights of Columbus
WYCA/WMCA

They may only ask for a donation and usually have a kitchen, air conditioning, tables and chairs, and a coat room.

Check your local phone book or stop by a neighborhood real estate office who should have a map of your area and all public access locations. By far these are cheaper than a catering venue. You may also want to do an outdoor ceremony, so check with your local parks. Determine your style and the kinds of colors you would like to use.

For ideas, you should buy the popular wedding magazines. For sites and vendors, it is worthwhile to purchase, &quot;Wedding Sites and Services&quot;. You may also want to visit David&apos;s Bridal or a wedding store in your area. You can pick the colors you would like for your bridal party.

 hi i&apos;m getting married in Aug 2011 and i need so help on finding a cheap venue for the reception. i&apos;m on a tight budget and most places is charging 900-2000 for a rent any advice in Denver CO 
 Posting my previous post again for those on a budget who have not read through all of the mails. Good luck on your event.

Like, I mentioned above, for inexpensive venues, I would do a search in your area for the following:

Eagles
Elks
Lions
VFW
Grange halls
Knights of Columbus
WYCA/WMCA

They may only ask for a donation and usually have a kitchen, air conditioning, tables and chairs, and a coat room.

Check your local phone book or stop by a neighborhood real estate office who should have a map of your area and all public access locations. By far these are cheaper than a catering venue. You may also want to do an outdoor ceremony, so check with your local parks. Determine your style and the kinds of colors you would like to use.

For ideas, you should buy the popular wedding magazines. For sites and vendors, it is worthwhile to purchase, &quot;Wedding Sites and Services&quot;. You may also want to visit David&apos;s Bridal or a wedding store in your area. You can pick the colors you would like for your bridal party.

Here&apos;s my favorite links:

Great info! Add in parks. social clubs, and a lot of churches have inexpensive parish hall rentals. We can save you a lot on your DJ and photographer so you can up your budget on the venue [Permalink]

The first step to finding a place would be to determine a rough idea of the guest count. Many venues can be eliminated based on capacity. The 2nd way to cut cost would be to consider a Friday wedding. You&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised to see just how many places are still available for a 2011 wedding if it is on a Friday. Also most places don&apos;t charge a hall charge in addition to catering if you choose a Friday. Try and look for places that provide the hall and catering in one, since that will usually save you $ as opposed to bringing in outside caterers, unless you already have a cheap caterer in mind.
If you&apos;re still having a hard time locating a venue, try searching for caters, and then look at locations they usually cater in. This can also help out. [Permalink]

Hi i am in alberta canada and I am planning my wedding in fernie bc. You can find smaller halls that are not the trendy places and they cost a lot less. I am ordering my flowers (silk) from budge bride. They are very reasonably priced. Have you checked out michaels for decorations etc. I did buy an arch there and if you use thier coupons it saves alot. I am just finding that being organized has helped alot. There are also many rental (local) stores that you can rent just about anything affordably. good luck and congrats

Congratulations on your engagement!

One of the best pieces of advice I can give you is to head to your local library or bookstore and pick up a book on planning your wedding. You&apos;ll find a wide array of choices, including planners to help you keep organized, books on budget-friendly weddings, wedding crafts, etc. Pick the one(s) that seem to suit your own situation. Books like these can be an invaluable resource and will help you get a handle on the process.

Your wedding may be the biggest and most complex event you&apos;ll ever plan (until you plan your daughter&apos;s!), and having access to the kind of professional guidance available just for the price of a book is the best investment you can make if you don&apos;t choose to use the services of a wedding planner.

My second most important piece of advice is to enjoy the process, not stress over trying to make everything perfect. Perfection is impossible to achieve, and holding yourself and everybody else involved to that standard puts undue stress on everyone.

I tell my brides that if, at the end of the day, you&apos;re married, you&apos;ve accomplished your goal. And when things go wrong (and they will), those are the things that make great stories to tell to your grandchildren!

Best wishes!

Marti Barton, Officiant

Check for wedding packages...Most of them include ceremony site, reception, photography, bouquets and more. Also, you can search for destination packages which include ceremony, reception AND you&apos;re already at your honeymoon destination. Good luck! [Permalink]

that&apos;s a really good idea, most country clubs have beautiful picture backgrounds too! Thank you =)

 I would suggest contacting your local country clubs in your local area or the area you have chosen to get married in. Most couuntry clubs are open to the public for receptions and in most cases have an onsite garden area for cerermonies. If you shop around enough I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find a venue within your price range. Most country clubs also include linen and chair covers in their price packages. I would suggest to stay away from hotel banquet rooms and offsite ceremony locations if you&apos;re on a budget, you don&apos;t need to be spending for transportation between those locations...

I hope this information was helpful.

I agree thats the cheapes most affordable way to do it. HoweveT, My sister got married at a close venue club in her town it was only 50 dollars. She only had close friends and family there about... 30 people there it was nice to know everyone!!! everyone brought food just like a potluck. They had there cake made cheap and we all pitched to decorate the hall.Also, her and her husband downloaded there own music on to the laptop and everyone pitched in to downloaded or uploaded there music of choice. She hired a minister justice of the peace to marry them, also had other to take pictures and video tape the whole reception. Her budget wa super cheap spent most of the money on rings. [Permalink]

Hi Jared,
Have you checked municipal recreation centers, civic groups, colleges/universities, religious institutions? How about summer camps that have dining areas that can be heated? Many of these organizations will rent space for a fraction of what a &quot;wedding chapel/hall&quot; or hotel banquet facility would cost.

I just recently got engaged with a wedding date for oct 31, 2012. unfortunately my fiance&apos;s family is enormous and even if we didn&apos;t invite half of them, they&apos;d still show up. i don&apos;t want our wedding to turn into an episode of &quot;cops&quot; so we&apos;re simply planning to accomadate a huge reception. we&apos;re getting plenty of help from family including the cake, cooking/food (what do you think of a &quot;tour of italy&quot; with salad? i love italian food!), plenty of family who have volunteered to be DJs, and finanacial help with my dress. pretty much the largest expenses my fiance and i have to pay for is the rings, venue, and photographer. am i missing anything? and what do you guys think?

Call your county courthouse and ask if there are any retired judges or justices of the peace that perform weddings. That&apos;s how we found our officiant 23 years ago.

For just 15 people. see if you can find a community room in a local apartment complex you can rent. Call your local parks&amp;recreation office to see if they have a facility. There&apos;s also the Elks Club, VFW, American Legion -- they often have places to rent. Hospitals often have a chapel available, or there may be one at a local college that&apos;s available. I just married a couple in a library -- they have small meeting rooms you can use if you&apos;re a resident. You can also see if a local restaurant has a private room where you can hold both your ceremony and reception. We have several local hotels here that have meeting rooms available to rent -- for your size guest list, you may be able to find something at a local hotel in your area that will work.

Good luck!
