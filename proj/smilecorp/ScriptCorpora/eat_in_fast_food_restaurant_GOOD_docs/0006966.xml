 76 Instead of reading the entire order to the customer, only ask them to confirm their order on the screen. This spurs faster service. 
 77 In the absence of an order-confirmation screen, repeat the order to the customer at the order post to ensure accuracy.

 78 Immediately after confirming the order with the customer, provide the full total denoting dollars and cents.

 79 Provide the next step. Sometimes a second window is open to collect payment; sometimes it is not. Clearly direct the customer to the next step.

 80 When handing the order to the customer, review the order with confidence.

 81 Customers respond favorably to outside order takers, a more personal system that serves as a line-busting technique during peak hours.

 82 If there is an opportunity to get an order into the kitchen sooner, take it. The move will deliver the speed drive-thru customers crave.

 83 Streamline the drive-thru process into three parts: greeting and order; money exchange, receipt, and condiments; and, finally, food delivery.

 84 Combo meals are a great way to order in one step and heighten the value perception. Place them side-by-side in a prominent spot on the menuboard.

 85 If breakfast is over, switch the drive-thru signage to the lunch and dinner menu. If cheeseburgers are not available before 10 a.m., hide that piece of the menu. Rotating the menu signage ensures a crisp look and allows the customer to focus on the available offerings.

 86 Double up on staff and even key equipment, such as the soda fountain and register, to ensure swift service during peak times.

 87 On-the-go, multitasking drive-thru consumers want packaging that keeps food safe and contained. Identify packaging that protects the product and the customer’s lap.
 88 Customers are on to your attempts to keep drive-thru times down. If their order takes longer than expected, send them to designated drive-thru parking spots and offer a free beverage instead of having them simply pull forward and wait. 
 89 Participants in a 2010 QSR drive-thru focus group widely agreed that having an employee bring an order to the car was a plus. As much as tech dominates today’s lives, the personal touches continually resonate with customers.

 90 Carhops can not only evoke a sense of nostalgia, but they can expedite service, take orders and payment, and hand completed orders to customers.

 91 Maximize the order taker’s comfort and limit distractions by placing this team member in a space away from the restaurant’s hustle and bustle.

 92 Team members should state the amount of change they are returning to the customer and count back that amount.

 93 Install signage that highlights new items as well as promotional offers or special pricing. Signage can also display high-margin items to entice a purchase.
 94 Institute a special drive-thru value meal complete with drive-thru-friendly items easy to eat while driving. 
 95 Run drive-thru-only drink promotions to increase higher-margin beverage sales.

 Design 

 96 Position a duplicate menuboard before the order post so that guests can peruse the menu as they wait. This reduces a customer feeling rushed into ordering and allows a full review of options. It also improves speed once they arrive at the order post.

 97 Push the car to the drive-thru window by narrowing the road.

 98 Tight bends and any changes in direction cause drivers to be frustrated and misguided. Make the lane smooth and gradual.
 99 To maximize double drive thrus, add extra signage to encourage drivers to use the left lane in addition to the traditional right lane. 
 100 Starting with the kitchen, design everything for speed and accuracy.

 101 On a new build, position the restaurant to the left to segregate customer parking and retain maximum room on the right side for drive-thru operations.

It is interesting to view 3M&apos;s interpratation on how to improve drive thru operations.

QSR communication systems accounts a blip of 3M&apos;s total global business that the general public would not notice if the business unit folded tomorrow.

Perhaps we should consult the true experts.

 Drive-thrus need to start 
 Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on October 20, 2011 - 15:33. 
Drive-thrus need to start having a dollar limit on how much they&apos;ll allow you to order. There&apos;s nothing worse than being stuck behind a family of 5 in a minivan who take forever to order and get their stuff when all most people want is to get their stuff and go. I think $20 is perfectly reasonable. Any more than that - get out of your van, go inside, and stop holding up the rest of the line.

So imagine a mini-van pulls up to the speaker in front of you. They go through their order and are told &quot;Sorry, your order total is $20.92. Please come inside. Then you have a minute or two of them complaining, trying to pull out of the drive-thru lane, etc.

Any drive-thru business would much prefer the car ordering $30 worth of food while making you wait the extra minute or two to order from the $1 value menu.

 Horrible suggestions... 
 Submitted by B Keyport (not verified) on October 21, 2011 - 03:11. 
Let&apos;s run through this objectively from the customer point of view - I agree with a lot of these, but...

6. Doggie treats - Not only is this bad health practice, in fact, in many locations, it&apos;s illegal.

10. Ordering post close to car - I prefer that it be farther away, so that I can be sure it don&apos;t damage my car.

12. Greeting - Yes, this is important, but already done. More important to me? Greet me with a &quot;Welcome to&quot; not &quot;Hi, how are you&quot; or an automated message.

15. &quot;Using what questions - Several places around here do this. I&apos;m more likely to end the transaction
and drive off, because it forces an upsell on me that I don&apos;t want. Don&apos;t do it. Passive &quot;Would you like a drink?&quot; is better to encourage upsells.

19. The hard candy -- ALLERGIES potential. I&apos;m allergic to peppermint. A particular mexican joint does this, and if I can&apos;t get to the candy before it melts from the food heat, I have a completely ruined meal.

29. Offsite - I find that offsite services increase frustration due to accent issues and offer no accountability. If I find out they go offsite, I go elsewhere.

46. Canopies - The canopy does no good if it&apos;s nothing more than a decoration. Make sure the canopy actually stops rain and enhances readability.

54. Speaker volume - Can we get some sites turned way down? I don&apos;t need to go deaf due to your speaker system set louder than an airplane taking off.

61/62 - Touch screens - Impractical to implement in a drive through setting.

66. Kitchen eavesdropping - many places do this already. In my experience, this makes orders slow down - a live computer monitor is best.

74 - Wifi - why would this improve drive thru - Inside sales, yes.

81 - Any order taking other than in house is bad.

88 - Even if you don&apos;t offer a free beverage, just giving me part of my order makes me happy - Give me my drinks, I&apos;ll wait, gladly.

97 - any narrowing of the path will make me nervous - I value my car, and won&apos;t take it into spaces that don&apos;t seem to be correct for my car - that includes safety posts making me pull further away from a window so you or I have to lean out of the window.

Here&apos;s one you didn&apos;t hit - Make sure the order screens are easy to understand - a lot of times, the system will send out codes that make no sense... &quot;TxWpr Meal -Mu +Ma&quot; -- do you know what that is? I do, because it&apos;s my order at BK - but would anyone else? Spell it out. &quot;Texas Whooper, No Mustard, add Mayo&quot;

 88 Customers are on to your attempts to keep drive-thru times down. If their order takes longer than expected, send them to designated drive-thru parking spots and offer a free beverage instead of having them simply pull forward and wait. 

If I am at the &quot;food delivery&quot; window and you ask me to wait anywhere else, I may just ask for my money back and leave. I expect you to fill my order in the order you received it. The only time this might be acceptable is if I placed an extra large order or some extra complicated item with extras or holds that isnt a normal menu item. If I ordered common items off your menu, I will wait AT the window for my food and everyone that came after me will wait behind me. I will simply ignore your expectation that I &apos;move out of the way&apos; so you can serve people that came after me.

Some other tips:

- when handing change to a customer do NOT set the coins on top of the bills in their hand - customers sitting with their side to the window have only one hand to work with - either hand them the coins first in their palm and let them pinch the bills, or hand them the bills first, and then the coins after they have put the bills away inside their car.

- once a customer has paid for their order, they should NOT have to wait anywhere they dont have access to an employee. If the &apos;pay&apos; window and the &apos;food&apos; window are separate, there should NOT be room for a car between the two windows. Ideal is to not expect customers to pay until their order is ready to hand to them. &quot;wait to pay&quot;, NOT &quot;pay to wait&quot;

- If there is a wait on some item that a customer is ordering, the time to tell them is RIGHT when they order it, so they can change their mind if they don&apos;t have time to wait , or at least BEFORE they pay - waiting until after you have already taken their money is RUDE.

curbs that prevent customers from leaving are RUDE - if I get an emergency call, or realize I am late and simply cant wait anymore, I should be able to exit the line and leave.

 Parking cars keep times down. 
 Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on April 15, 2012 - 01:11. 
Parking cars keep times down. If you think about it would you want to compound time onto time, you would have the sixth car waiting 6 minuets for their order. Yes you as a customer is very important but... keeping the flow in DT makes every customer feel important. Most standards for a DT time is 3 mins, does it really matter if you get your food in 3 mins being parked or at the window. Point being if you were a king I would treat you like one but you wouldn&apos;t be at a fast food drive thru if you were a king!

Instead of pointing out what you hate, let&apos;s hear what you liked, and why. It&apos;s impractical to implement touch-screen interfaces in a drive through setting? OK, I&apos;m supposed to just accept that blindly? You comment makes me suspect you might have actual experience with this. If so, the reasons you omitted would make your comment tremendously valuable, instead of a &quot;your suggestions are dumb because I&apos;m allergic to peppermint&quot; downer.

Here. I&apos;ll start - I totally agree with #81. Line busting orders gives you the opportunity to speed up the process. It also gives you the opportunity to not just serve, but really connect with your customers. Win-win.

&quot;9 Customers are clamoring for healthier options in the quick-service sector, so showcase items that incorporate a healthy message.&quot;

How about actually offering healthy items? I like the lettuce-wrapped burgers or whole wheat bun, veggie sandwiches, etc., iced tea.

And enough with the combos - stop interrupting me to ask if I want the combo. It&apos;s rude. &quot;I&apos;d like the jumbo burger...&quot; &quot;...would you like the combo?&quot; Besides which, side orders for combos are usually the unhealthiest items on the menu: fries, onion rings, giant sodas. I know you&apos;re trying to kill me, please don&apos;t make it so obvious. Offer me an apple, an orange, a side of raw broccoli, and I&apos;ll be happy to order the combo.

 Hiring for personality? Really? 
 Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on October 23, 2011 - 10:04. 
26. Hire for personality. Please! Everyone knows that fast food places hire teenagers, who are by definition surly, emo, or both. These are the icons of the fast food industry.

How about hiring for native language? An employee working in the fastest-paced part of the restaurant needs to be able to both speak and understand the language of the country in which he or she is employed. I know from experience that restaurants in Quebec have no trouble finding employees who can comprehend French. Burger joints in Switzerland have teenage employees who can speak all 4 of the local languages. What is wrong with American establishments that prevents them from hiring English speakers? I cannot remember the last time I went through a drive through in this country without having to park and go inside to get the correct order.

92. I&apos;ve already given up on fast food places hiring for any kind of simple mathematics skills. Making change is a huge challenge to anyone educated in American public schools. So is counting change back to a customer. I usually have to tell the drive through staff what they should be giving me back. Most of them are poorly-trained enough to take my word for it. If I were less scrupulous, I could pocket quite a bit.

 Many ideas are unrealistic here. 
 Submitted by Pepper (not verified) on October 24, 2011 - 18:38. 
Sure, I can accept service with a smile being requested, even keeping the orders right etc...

But some of the ideas on this list tell me that this site thinks employees must have hours of free time on their hands... instead of the reality that most businesses are trying to make employees do more work with less people.

I mean really, dog treats? So you want people to start baking dog biscuits just in case someone wants to bring Fido along and feed him? I mean if they were going to feed the dog from the fast food they&apos;d probably just give it a burger.

And windshield wipers. Yeah. I know you think it makes you stand out but I am betting that more often than not, the employee out there wiping windshield is just going to become &quot;The Target&quot;. Why? Because he or she is in view - or within REACH. I fully expect some of the less... patient... customers would start screaming at the windshield guy to &quot;Get the hell back inside and make me my food!&quot;

Or worse - if they&apos;re angry - well that employee is in reach now. I mean when we have news reports of people trying to physically fight with some of the workers through the window, what&apos;s going to happen when there&apos;s a worker right next to the car? more than likely a very disgruntled customer might just get into &quot;rage mode&quot; and hit them with the car.

O_o

Instead of looking at &quot;how wonderful would it be if they did THIS TOO&quot; I suggest you step back and think about just how feasible it really is, how much it would cost the companies - and thus cost the consumers - and how it can go wrong. Because believe me it can go very very wrong.

&quot;Clean the windshields of waiting cars. No one does this, which is precisely why you should.&quot;

The fact that there seems to be no justification for this other than &quot;nobody does it&quot; should have been a tip off that this is a terrible idea.

Here is another: the very nature of the job would expose the employee doing it to increased risk of injury. They&apos;re going to be outside, in all kinds of weather, around moving vehicles. They can slip and fall in icy conditions, or they can be hit by a car that doesn&apos;t stop fast enough, or with a driver that mistakes the gas for the brake.

And as mentioned before, that person will be a handy target for anybody feeling particularly disgruntled about the wait for their food, or having their order messed up, or whatever else. We&apos;re already seeing more and more stories about people jumping counters and assaulting employees. Why make somebody be a sitting duck?

I think # 30 should rank up in the top 10 if listed by importance. From a construction standpoint, it is so crucially imperative to really think the logistics through carefully. Afterthoughts end up looking like just that - you want a drive thru that looks well thought and planned out for ease of use and supreme convenience to the customer. This will add up to a more efficient and more profitable addition to your restaurant in the end. I briefly expanded on a couple of your points here - http://riversedgepm.com/blog/?p=233
