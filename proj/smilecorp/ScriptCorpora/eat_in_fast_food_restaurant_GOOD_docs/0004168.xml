NEW CALIFORNIA HOMELESS MOVE FROM PARK TO PARK

 TRABUCO CANYON, Calif., Aug. 6— Only a few miles from some of the most expensive communities in affluent Orange County, people are living in tents, vans and cars in public parks. They have been left homeless by economic hard times.

Officials of volunteer agencies in Orange County link a small but growing population of park residents to a sharp rise in requests for shelter from families and individuals who until recently were selfsufficient. They attribute the appearance of a new kind of homeless to the double squeeze of scarce jobs and soaring rental costs in a region that has had one of the highest household incomes in the country.

&apos;&apos;I see the reason as the economy,&apos;&apos; said Michael Elias, director of the Christian Temporary Housing Facility in the city of Orange. &apos;&apos;The increase is in the family-type person, who can&apos;t find a job, lost the apartment, can&apos;t get credit.&apos;&apos; Jobless Rate Has Increased

The unemployment rate for Orange County has jumped sharply, from 3.6 percent in May 1981 to 6.4 percent a year later, according to the latest available Federal figures. Mr. Elias said his facility filled 8,571 requests from needy families for shelter in all of 1981. This year requests reached 5,225 in the first six months alone.

Other service agencies report a similar trend. Jean Forbath, director of Share Our Selves, an emergency center in Costa Mesa, Calif., said 180 families with a total of 618 children had sought shelter or rent money to stave off eviction in the first 20 days of June, contrasted with 108 families for the whole month of June last year.

There are no reliable figures on the number living in parks, largely because it is a floating population. The estimates of shelter officials range from 20 families to more than 200.

Rick and Penny Thielemann and their two children live in a tent in O&apos;Neill Park in Trabuco Canyon about 15 miles from such wealthy enclaves as Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. They cook in a cinderblock pit and wash up in camp restrooms.

Mr. Thielemann, a roofer, said they had been living in parks since November when they were evicted from an apartment after he fell behind in his rent because of the construction slump.

&apos;&apos;We had a choice of either spending what we had on an apartment or buying camping gear,&apos;&apos; Mr. Thielemann said. &apos;&apos;The kids and us, we all decided to buy camping gear because we knew work was going to be slow.&apos;&apos;

He said the family moved from park to park to avoid running afoul of laws barring long-term residence in campgrounds. The Thielemann children, Lori, 7 years old, and Michael, 10, were taken out of school because of the frequent moves. Mrs. Thielemann said they were teaching the children themselves, with $30 worth of schoolbooks.

Many of the park people are refugees from other states, lured to Orange County by its reputation as a thriving job center. Marlene Lenz, a 27-year-old Arizonan, said she had migrated with her husband, David Porter, in a camper in the hope both would get work.

&apos;&apos;We investigated it first,&apos;&apos; she said. &apos;&apos;We were making phone calls to Las Vegas all the way to San Diego. But by the time we got here, the people from Michigan and those places had flooded the market.&apos;&apos;

Another, Janet Duncan, described her plight while she tidied up a van crowded with belongings near a bed on cinderblocks in the open air. She said her boyfriend, Tony, was a union welder who traveled to Los Angeles every Monday unsuccessfully seeking work on his union&apos;s job list.

She had a job in a Westminster, Calif., thrift store, she said, &apos;&apos;but the thrift store went out of business.&apos;&apos; Mrs. Forbath of Share Our Selves described the situation as an emergence of &apos;&apos;tent cities.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;The people living in the parks can&apos;t get enough money together to get into an apartment,&apos;&apos; she said. &apos;&apos;Last week we had a family where the father worked in a factory days and the mother in a fast-food restaurant at night. They had four children and they made $30 a month too much to get welfare help. Welfare told them if they continued to keep their children in a car in the park they would take the children from them. It&apos;s a horrible situation, a Catch-22.&apos;&apos;

Mrs. Forbath said her organization had been giving families money for the $5 nightly park fees and in some cases buying tents and camping equipment. But the goal is to establish a revolving loan fund to provide rents and deposits for apartments.

Of particular concern, the officials said, is the lack of a shelter in the county for women who are alone or who head families. The Rev. Jane Ann Moore, of the United Church of Christ Board of Homeland Ministries in Irvine, Calif., said the increase in homeless women had been aggravated as low-cost housing has disappeared through condominium conversions.

&apos;&apos;A lot of single mothers have brought their children here because of the good reputation of the school system,&apos;&apos; she said. &apos;&apos;They&apos;re being the best mother they know how to be, but because of the high housing costs, if the rent goes up, if anything happens, they end up on the streets.&apos;&apos;

Mrs. Moore is one of the leaders of an effort to link a newly formed local coaltion with the National Coalition for the Homeless based in New York.

Mr. Elias, of the Christian Temporary Housing Facility, said, &apos;&apos;The ironic thing is that the city of Irvine has just voted $3.5 million to build a Holiday Inn for doggies, an animal shelter,&apos;&apos; he said, &apos;&apos;and the city has given not one dime for a shelter for homeless people.&apos;&apos;
