Virginia Beach Man Wins $1 Million In Tax Free Million Game

 November 6, 2008

 All John Costner of Virginia Beach wanted was to get some breakfast for his son. He was on his way to a fast-food restaurant when he stopped to play the Virginia Lotterys Tax Free Million Scratcher game. Shortly after buying three tickets and leaving the store, he returned to ask the clerk a million-dollar question.

Can you tell me if this is real? he asked, holding out a ticket. Did I win $1 million?

Indeed, he did win. Mr. Costner took the top prize in the Virginia Lottery Scratcher game Tax Free Million. He purchased the winning ticket at Malbon Bros. Corner Mart, located at 1896 General Booth Blvd. in Virginia Beach.

On November 6, 2008, he returned to the store to receive his prize from Virginia Lottery Hampton Roads Customer Service Center Manager Keary Fox. The store also received a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket.

Tax Free Million is a unique game from the Virginia Lottery, because the top prize of $1 million is the after-tax amount. Lottery officials add the required state and federal tax withholding to the prize, so a full $1 million remains for the winner.

Mr. Costner told Lottery officials that his winnings will be put to a very special use: his mother, who lives in a nursing home. This will take care of her for the rest of her life, he said.

He also took care of someone else: the cashier who sold him the winning ticket. Mr. Costner gave Kim Woods $10,000 from his winnings.

He is the third and final player to claim the top prize, which means the game is being closed. It is the Lotterys policy to close Scratcher games as soon as the final top prize is claimed.

Nearly 95 cents of each dollar spent on the Virginia Lottery by players goes back to the Commonwealth in the form of contributions to education, prizes and retailer commissions. Since 1999,all Virginia Lottery profitshavebeen designatedsolelyto K-12 public school education in the Commonwealth. In that time, the Lottery has turned over nearly $3.9 billion for Virginias public schools. The latest annual profits of$455 million currently represent about6 percent of state funding for public education in Virginia. In 20 years, the Lottery has sold more than $20 billion in tickets, awarded more than $1 billion in retailer commissions and paid more than $10.9 billion in prizes to players.

Please play responsibly.
