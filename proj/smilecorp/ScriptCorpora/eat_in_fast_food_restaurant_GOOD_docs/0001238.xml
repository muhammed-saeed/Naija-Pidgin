SHORT ANSWER
99. What is the objective of the product decision? Develop and implement a product strategy that meets the demands of the marketplace with a competitive advantage. (Goods and services selection, moderate)
100. What is a product-by-value analysis, and what type of decision does it help managers make? A product-by-value analysis lists products in descending order of their individual dollar contribution to the firm, as well as the total annual dollar contribution of the product. It helps managers evaluate possible strategies for each product. The product-by-value report focuses management&apos;s attention on the strategic direction for each product. (Goods and services selection, moderate) 101. Identify the factors that influence new product opportunities. Factors that influence new product opportunities include economic change, sociological and demographic change, technological change, political change, and other changes brought about through market practice, professional standards, suppliers, and distributors. (Goods and services selection, moderate) 102.&quot;With respect to the product decision, managers must be able to accept risk and tolerate failure.&quot;Comment on why this is a necessary hazard in making new product decisions, given all the powerful tools and carefully built systems that support that decision. The vast majority of new product ideas do not become marketable products, and most marketable products are failures. Perhaps 500 designs accompany each success. (Goods and services selection, moderate) 103. Identify the general benefits derived from CAD. Product quality (better adherence to standards); shorter design time; production cost reductions (from better design); database availability (for new products); and new range of capabilities (ease programming of CNC machines). (Generating new products, moderate) {AACSB: Use of IT} 104. Is it possible for a product&apos;s life cycle stage to affect its product strategy? In particular, describe how one product in growth and another in maturity might have different product strategies. There is no reason for the strategy to be static through the life cycle stages. Organizations often treat new products differently than older ones, in terms of support for changes,
aggressiveness in pursuit of market, etc. In particular, growth is associated with stabilization of design, and with ensuring that sufficient capacity exists. Maturity is a time for high-volume operations and cost control. (Goods and services selection, moderate) 105. Desribe the benefits associated with value engineering. Benefits include immediate cost reductions; reduced product complexity; additional standardization of components; improvement of functional aspects of the products; improved job design and job safety; improved maintainability (serviceability) of the product; and robust design. (Product development, moderate) 106. Provide some examples of recent product changes, i.e. new products that are replacing older ones. Answers will vary. The list in the text includes: TV to HDTV, radio to satellite radio, coffee shops to Starbucks lifestyle coffee, traveling circuses to Cirque du Soleil, land lines to cell phones, cell phone to Blackberry, Walkman to iPod, and mops to Swiffers. (Generating new products, moderate) {AACSB: Reflective Thinking} 107. What is quality function deployment (QFD)? QFD refers to determining what will satisfy the customer and translating those customer desires into the target design. (Product development, easy) 108. Identify the steps involved in building the House of Quality. Identify customers&apos; wants, identify product/service attributes, relate the customers&apos; wants to the product/service how&apos;s, conduct an evaluation of competing products, develop performance specifications for product or service how&apos;s, and assign how&apos;s to the appropriate place in the transformation process. (Product development, moderate) 109. Explain the difference between value analysis and value engineering. Value engineering is concerned with reducing cost and improving function in a preproduction setting; value analysis, with similar aims, takes place during production, when the product has shown that it will succeed. Techniques are similar. (Product development and Issues for product design, moderate) 110. Aggressive new product development requires that organizations build structures internally that contain what features? They should have open communication with customers, innovative organizational cultures, aggressive R&amp;D, strong leadership, formal incentives, and training. (Generating new products, difficult) {AACSB: Communication} 111. What two issues should be considered in combination in order to enhance the likelihood of ethical decision in the realm of product design? Why is each important? The two issues are (1) view product design from a&quot;systems&quot;perspective, and (2) consider the life cycle of the product. The first issue causes managers to go beyond&quot;what is best or cheapest for the firm?&quot;The second causes managers to address environmental concerns over the life of the product, not just at time of manufacture. (Issues for product design, moderate) {AACSB: Ethical Reasoning} 112. Identify the specific guidelines that can help an operations manager achieve environmentally friendly designs. Specifically, the following ideas are presented in the text: make products recyclable, use recycled material, use less harmful ingredients, use lighter components, use
less energy, and use less material. (Issues for product design, moderate) {AACSB: Ethical Reasoning} 113. What are some of the benefits from using environmental teams for product design? Environmental teams help develop safe and more environmentally sound products, minimize the waste of raw materials and energy, differentiate products from competition, reduce environmental liabilities, increase cost-effectiveness of complying with environmental regulations, and help the organization be recognized as a good corporate citizen. (Issues for product design, moderate) {AACSB: Ethical Reasoning} 114. Discuss the advisability of using modular assemblies in manufacturing. (What are the advantages and disadvantages?) To what extent can these arguments be utilized in service products? Modules are easily segmented components; they add flexibility to production and marketing; allows mix-and-match of components (customization at point of customer contact). Use of modules usually means fewer parts, less design and tooling expense. Disadvantages include using a module in a product for which a more specific component would have been better. Modules exist in services, as in fast-food meals built to customer specification. (Issues for product design, difficult) 115. What is time-based competition? Time-based competition is competition that is based on time. It involves rapid development of products, fast introduction to the marketplace. Often, the first company into production may have its product adopted as the&quot;standard.&quot;(Time-based competition, moderate) 116. State the benefits of implementing group technology. Benefits include improved design; reduced raw materials and purchases; simplified production planning and control; improved routing and machine loading; reduced tooling setup time, work-in-process, and production time; and development of work cells. (Defining the product, moderate) 117. Identify the external product development strategies; describe each in a sentence or two. The external product development strategies include alliances, joint ventures, and purchase of technology or expertise by acquiring the developer. Alliances are cooperative agreements that allow firms to remain independent, but use complementing strengths to pursue strategies consistent with their individual missions. Joint ventures are combined ownership to pursue new products or markets. Purchasing technology or expertise is usually accomplished by acquiring entrepreneurial firms that have already developed the technology that fits the mission. The issue then becomes fitting the purchased organization, its technology, and its product line into the buying firm, rather than a product development issue. (Time-based competition, moderate) 118. How does configuration management manifest itself when you ask for service on your automobile? Configuration management is used by every automobile manufacturer to track all of the changes between and during a model year. To be specific about the part that is needed, the VIN (vehicle identification number) is often used. (Documents for production, moderate) 119. Briefly explain how Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) impacts product design. PLM is an umbrella of software programs that attempts to bring together many phases of product design and manufacture. PLM products often start with product design (CAD/CAM); move on to design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA); and then into product routing, materials, layout, assembly, maintenance and even environmental issues. (Documents for production, moderate)
120. Identify the four methods of service design that can reduce costs and enhance the product. Customizing as late in the process as possible; modularizing the product; identifying the service parts that lend themselves to automation or reduced customer interaction; and focusing design on the moment of truth. (Service design, moderate)
PROBLEMS
121. JDI, Inc. is trying to decide whether to make-or-buy a part (#J-45FPT). Purchasing the part would cost them $1.50 each. If they design and produce it themselves, it will result in a per unit cost of $0.75. However, the design investment would be $50,000. Further, they realize that for this type of part, there is a 30% chance that the part will need to be redesigned at an additional cost of $50,000. Regardless of whether they make-or-buy the part, JDI will need 100,000 of these parts. Using decision trees analysis and EMV, what should JDI do? Show the decision tree. Since the expected values represent costs, JDI should select the lowest expected value, and make the part. Its expected monetary value (cost) is $140,000 versus $150,000 for the buy decision.

It is projected that this item will sell for $10 each. If the item is outsourced, there is virtually no cost other than the $6 per unit that they would pay their supplier. Internally, they have two choices. Process A requires an investment of $120,000 for design and equipment, but results in a $4 per unit cost. Process B requires only a $100,000 investment, but its per unit cost is $5. Regardless of whether the item is subcontracted or produced internally, there is a 50% chance that they will sell 50,000 units, and a 50% chance that they will sell 100,000 units. Draw the decision tree appropriate to the alternatives and outcomes stated. Using decision trees and EMV, what is their best choice? Process A promises the highest profit with an EMV of $330,000.

(Application of decision trees to product design, moderate) {AACSB: Analytic Skills} 123. A company manufactures specialty pollution-sensing devices for the offshore oil industry. One particular device has reached maturity, and the company is considering whether to replace it with a newer model. Technologies have not changed dramatically, so the new device would have similar functionality to the existing one, but would be smaller and lighter in weight. The firm&apos;s three choices are: keep the old model; design a replacement device with internal resources; and purchase a new design from a firm that is one of its suppliers. The market for these devices will be either&quot;receptive&quot;or&quot;neutral&quot;of the replacement model. The financial estimates are as follows: Keeping the old design will yield a profit of $6 million dollars. Designing the replacement internally will yield $10 million if the market is&quot;receptive,&quot;but a $3 million loss if the market is&quot;neutral.&quot;Acquiring the new design from the supplier will profit $4 million under&quot;receptive,&quot;$1 million under&quot;neutral.&quot;The company feels that the market has a 70 percent chance of being&quot;receptive&quot;and a 30 percent chance of being&quot;neutral.&quot;Draw the appropriate decision tree. Calculate expected value for all courses of action. What action yields the highest expected value?
Profit $10 million
Lose $3 million
Profit $4 milliion
Profit $1 million
profit $6 million
The three expected monetary values are: Develop replacement internally: $10,000,000 x .7 $3,000,000 x .3 = $6.1 million Purchase new design: $4,000,000 x .7 + $1,000,000 x .3 = $3.1 million Stay with current design: $6 million The company should choose the highest value, and develop a replacement product design with internal resources.
