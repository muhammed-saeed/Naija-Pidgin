 I am a student and have worked at McDonalds for two and a half years. The location I work at is extremely flexible, and will give you the number of hours that you are looking for. If you end up applying for a job you will write on the application if you are applying for the front or in the kitchen. I would suggest working at McDonalds if you need flexible hours, and if you are a people person. Hope this helps!

 I&apos;m pretty sure they pay minimum or competitive wages, but if you want to smell like greasy food when you go home, take the job! But it&apos;s a job! Considering in this economy its extremely hard to find a job. I certainly do not want to work at a fast food restaurant, i would rather work at a retail clothing store or something like that.

 Mcdonald&apos;s is horrible. : / You&apos;ll smell like grease everyday you work there!Lol.
I suggest if you want to work at a food place you should work somewhere like subway where at least the food is a little better, or just some decent restaurant.

 I&apos;ve never worked there, but I&apos;ve read a lotttt of articles that talk about disgusting things that fast food in general has and if I worked there and saw it happen I could never eat fast food again but I bet it&apos;ll be fine to get money I guess. It&apos;s all up to u
