 Post a Comment Now. Comments Wed, 07 Mar 2007 10:42:00 GMT (1) In most states any changes in salary or wages must be provided in writing prior to the work being performed. So if you work for a bottom tier company that doesn&apos;t follow the law in providing it in writing you&apos;ll usually find out when you get your paycheck that they cut your pay. Point of fact you have now been notified in writing of the wage cut but you can file and claim the difference between the last paystub and this current one if it&apos;s the one the company has to rely on the paycheck as proof of notification in writing. Another words the proof in writing with the paycheck is good for future paychecks but not the one they do first. Thu, 08 Mar 2007 05:19:00 GMT (2) I don&apos;t know of any law in Missouri that requires vacation to be paid out at ANY specific rate. The standard is the current rate of pay, but in Missouri, you wouldn&apos;t even have to be paid your accrued vacation even if you terminated. So, my opinion would be that it would be legal to pay it at the prior rate, as there is now law requiring it be otherwise. Thu, 08 Mar 2007 10:25:00 GMT (3) So, I should just schedule vac (starting tomorrow) and resign when I return ! There is no way I can stay and afford a $700/mth pay cut ! Thank you..... Thu, 08 Mar 2007 09:38:00 GMT (4) So, an employer is not obligated to pay accrued or earned vacation time when an employee leaves whether they are being fired or resign? Thu, 08 Mar 2007 10:19:00 GMT (5) That is correct. Missouri does not require the payout of unused vacation at termination, regardless of whether the termination is voluntary or involuntary. Wed, 07 Mar 2007 11:15:00 GMT (6) I disagree with Bill that&quot;most&quot;states require written notice. In many states a verbal notice is fine. However, Missouri is one state that does require it to be in writing. Missouri law requires a 30-day, written notice of the reduction.

Scroll down to the fourth question from the bottom.

However, no state agency enforces this; you&apos;d have to file a civil suit. Wed, 07 Mar 2007 13:00:00 GMT (7) Good info, thanks. Remember this was verbal, nothing in writing..... Since this happened on a Monday (the last day of the payperiod), I asked if that payperiod would be at the higher pay rate, and I was told yes. I was given til the end of the day to decide if I wanted to accept the pay cut or not. Without having another job to go to, I told them I really had no choice right now but to accept the pay cut. I just noticed that I will have 1 day pay at the reduced wage. Since I should have been given notice in writing, first of all, this payperiod should not be reduced, secondly, I was told it wouldn&apos;t be for this week. I also asked on Monday that since my 1 year anniversary was on Wednesday, could I get paid out my vacation time and I was told that wouldn&apos;t be a problem. My question is: Will they have to pay my vac time at the higher wage (since I earned it at that rate), or CAN they pay the lower wage for vacation payout? (I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t even HAVE to pay my vac to me, but they did agree to) Wed, 07 Mar 2007 10:46:00 GMT (8) Interesting.... They did not provide the wage cut in writing, instead, they sat down and told me on Monday which was the last day of the payperiod. It will not be effective until Tuesday, the first day of the next payperiod. Since it was verbal, is that still ok? Mon, 05 Mar 2007 08:15:00 GMT (9) The law requires only that you receive at least minimum wage and if the minimum wage increases, and you make minimum wage, then you get an increase, too. Other than that, there is no law that is going to force the employer to give a review or raise, ever. Post a Comment Now.
