Abstract
The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides $4.3
billion for the Race to the Top Fund
(referred to in the statute as the State
Incentive Grant Fund). This is a
competitive grant program. The purpose
of the program is to encourage and
reward States that are creating the
conditions for education innovation and
reform; achieving significant
improvement in student outcomes,
including making substantial gains in
student achievement, closing
achievement gaps, improving high
school graduation rates, and ensuring
student preparation for success in
college and careers; and implementing
ambitious plans in four core education
reform areas: (a) Adopting
internationally-benchmarked standards
and assessments that prepare students
for success in college and the
workplace; (b) building data systems
that measure student success and
inform teachers and principals in how
they can improve their practices; (c)
increasing teacher effectiveness and
achieving equity in teacher distribution;
and (d) turning around our lowestachieving schools.
The U.S. Department of Education
(the Department) will collect this data
from the 12 Race to the Top grantee
states to inform its review of grantee
implementation, outcomes, oversight,
and accountability. The Department will
use these forms to inform on-site visits,
‘‘stocktake’’ meetings with
Implementation and Support Unit
leadership at the Department, and
annual reports for individual grantees
and the grant program as a whole.
In order to allow for a comprehensive
program review of the Race to the Top
grantees, we are requesting a three-year
clearance with this form.

Final Determination Regarding Energy
Efficiency Improvements in the Energy
Standard for Buildings, Except LowRise Residential Buildings, ANSI/
ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1–2010
Office of Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy, Department of
Energy.
ACTION: Notice of final determination.
AGENCY:

The Department of Energy
(DOE or Department) has determined
that the 2010 edition of the Energy
Standard for Buildings, Except Low-Rise
Residential Buildings, American
National Standards Institute (ANSI)/
American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America
(IESNA) Standard 90.1–2010, (Standard
90.1–2010 or the 2010 edition) would
achieve greater energy efficiency in
buildings subject to the code, than the
2007 edition (Standard 90.1–2007 or the
2007 edition). Also, DOE has
determined that the quantitative
analysis of the energy consumption of
buildings built to Standard 90.1–2010,
as compared with buildings built to
Standard 90.1–2007, indicates national
source energy savings of approximately
18.2 percent of commercial building
energy consumption. Additionally, DOE
has determined site energy savings are
estimated to be approximately 18.5
percent. Upon publication of this
affirmative final determination, States
are required to certify that they have
reviewed the provisions of their
commercial building code regarding
energy efficiency, and as necessary,
updated their code to meet or exceed
Standard 90.1–2010. Additionally, this
notice provides guidance to States on
Certifications, and Requests for
Extensions of Deadlines for Certification
Statements.

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices
Building Energy Efficiency Standards
Program. (42 U.S.C. 6831 et seq.)
Section 304(b), as amended, of ECPA
provides that whenever the ANSI/
ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1–1989
(Standard 90.1–1989 or 1989 edition), or
any successor to that code, is revised,
the Secretary must make a
determination, not later than 12 months
after such revision, whether the revised
code would improve energy efficiency
in commercial buildings and must
publish notice of such determination in
the Federal Register. (42 U.S.C. 6833
(b)(2)(A)) The Secretary may determine
that the revision of Standard 90.1–1989
or any successor thereof, improves the
level of energy efficiency in commercial
buildings. If so, then not later than two
years after the date of the publication of
such affirmative determination, each
State is required to certify that it has
reviewed and updated the provisions of
its commercial building code regarding
energy efficiency with respect to the
revised or successor code. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) The State must include
in its certification a demonstration that
the provisions of its commercial
building code, regarding energy
efficiency, meet or exceed the revised
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i))
If the Secretary makes a determination
that the revised standard will not
improve energy efficiency in
commercial buildings, State commercial
codes must meet or exceed the last
revised standard for which the Secretary
has made a positive determination. (42
U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(ii)). On July 20,
2011, the DOE published a
determination in the Federal Register
updating the reference code to Standard
90.1–2007. See 76 FR 43287 (July 20,
2011).
ECPA also requires the Secretary to
permit extensions of the deadlines for
the State certification if a State can
demonstrate that it has made a good
faith effort to comply with the
requirements of section 304(c) of ECPA
and that it has made significant progress
in doing so. (42 U.S.C. 6833(c))

B. Background
1. Publication of Standard 90.1–2010
ASHRAE and the IESNA approved the
publication of the 2010 edition of
Energy Standard for Buildings Except
Low-rise Residential Buildings, in
October 2010.
The Standard was developed under
ANSI-approved consensus standard
procedures. Standard 90.1 is under
continuous maintenance by a Standing
Standard Project Committee (SSPC) for
which the ASHRAE Standard
Committee has established a

VerDate Mar&lt;15&gt;2010

16:34 Oct 18, 2011

Jkt 226001

documented program for regular
publication of addenda or revisions,
including procedures for timely,
documented, consensus action on
requests for change to any part of the
standard. ANSI approves addenda prior
to their publication by ASHRAE and
IESNA and prior to their inclusion in a
new version of Standard 90.1. ANSI
approved the final addendum for
inclusion in Standard 90.1–2010 on July
24, 2010. Appeals were made to several
addenda and the results of the appeals
process were not final until October 15,
2010. The 2010 edition was published
on October 28, 2010.
2. Preliminary Determination
In arriving at a preliminary
determination, DOE first reviewed all
significant changes between the 2010
edition and the 2007 edition. Standard
90.1 is complex and covers a broad
spectrum of the energy related
components and systems in buildings
ranging from simple storage buildings to
complex hospitals and laboratories. The
size of buildings addressed range from
those smaller than single family homes
to the largest buildings in the world.
The approach to development of the
standard used in the 2010 edition was
not changed from that used for the 2007
edition, with no changes to the scope or
the way components are defined. DOE
preliminarily determined that because
no significant changes were made to the
structure, scope, or component
definitions of Standard 90.1–2007, a
similar methodology used for the
analysis of Standard 90.1–2007 could be
utilized for the analysis of Standard
90.1–2010, consisting of a qualitative
comparison of the textual changes to
requirements in Standard 90.1–2010
from Standard 90.1–2007, and a
quantitative estimate of the energy
savings developed from whole building
simulations of a standard set of
buildings constructed to both Standards
over a range of U.S. climates. DOE used
an extension of the procedure used for
the Standard 90.1–2007 determination
for the quantitative estimate of energy
savings. The extension was that
additional building types were added to
the analysis. DOE used the same
simulation tool and data for weighing
the results by building type and climate
as used for the 90.1–2007
determination.
A detailed discussion of the analysis
methodology, which was subject to
public comment in 2010 and 2011, can
be found in the Notice of Preliminary
Determination for Standard 90.1–2007
and in the Notice of Preliminary
Determination for Standard 90.1–2010.

3. Public Comments Regarding the
Preliminary Determination
DOE accepted public comments on
the preliminary determination for
Standard 90.1–2010 until August 19,
2011. DOE received submissions from a
total of six different entities.
The Edison Electric Institute (EEI)
submitted a written comment (Docket
No. EERE–2010–BT–DET–0050–0002,
pgs. 1–3) supporting the preliminary
determination while stating the
following four issues: (1) DOE should
only use the results from its site energy
analysis and its energy cost analysis to
make its final determination, and not
report the source energy analysis results
in the final determination, (2) the energy
savings, or at least a portion of the
estimated energy savings, from addenda
that include new federal energy
efficiency standards or provide updates
to energy efficiency standards should be
incorporated into the final
determination analysis, (3) EEI would
request that the information about the
impact of addendum ‘‘bu’’ be included
in the final determination notice, and
(4) in terms of primary energy
associated with electricity, the value in
this notice is overstated and that DOE
should use a more realistic ratio for
electricity in its estimates.
In regards to EEI’s first comment, the
Department still believes that despite
the fact that the source energy analysis
results are estimates, it is important to
the discussion of global resources and
environmental issues to report them.
Source energy (or primary energy)
addresses the energy needed to deliver
energy to the building in addition to the
energy used at the building and thus
provides a more complete view of the
total energy expenditure used by a
building than site energy. However,
DOE realizes that site energy is the
energy that typically appears on utility
bills and that is seen by the consumer.
DOE also realizes that it is energy cost
(as shown on energy bills) to which
many consumers react. It is for this
reason that DOE provides all three
metrics—site energy, source energy, and
energy cost—in its determinations.
EEI’s second comment is in reference
to the fact that the Department does not
include the impact from new or updated
federal energy efficiency standards in its
determination of energy savings. For the
quantitative analysis performed for the
90.1–2010 preliminary determination
(http://www.energycodes.gov/status/
documents/
QuantitativeAnalysisReport9012010Determination.pdf), DOE

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices

incorporated only addenda that
modified the prescriptive requirements
of the Standard. New or updated federal
efficiency standards are not
independent requirements of the
standard, but rather reflections of
Federal manufacturing requirements. In
specific circumstances, particularly
with regard to requirements for certain
heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) equipment,
addenda to Standard 90.1–2010 reflect
changes to national manufacturing
standards previously developed by DOE
or enacted independently through
Federal legislation. The energy savings
that are attributable to these national
manufacturing standards would accrue
no matter what version of Standard 90.1
is considered and regardless of whether
they are reflected in the text of the
Standards, therefore DOE has not
incorporated these as changes
contributing to energy savings for the
purpose of the Determination.
EEI’s third comment requests that
information regarding the impact of
addendum ‘‘bu’’ be included in the final
determination. Addendum ‘‘bu’’ added
equipment efficiency requirements for
mechanical equipment serving
computer rooms, however none of the
prototype building models that DOE
uses in its simulations have data centers
and therefore the quantifiable impact of
this addendum was not captured. DOE
does note that the impact of addendum
‘‘bu’’ is captured in the qualitative, or
text comparison analysis, where
addendum ‘‘bu’’ is listed as a major
positive and noted as a new efficiency
requirement. When the prototype
building models used in this
determination were developed by DOE
and later reviewed by ASHRAE, no data
center models were included because at
that point Standard 90.1 did not include
efficiency requirements related to data
centers. DOE did not add data centers to
the prototype building models for this
determination because the quantitative
impact of this addendum would not
change the fact that this is a positive
final determination of energy savings.
DOE is considering adding data centers
to the prototype building models for
future determinations.
EEI’s final comment suggests that
DOE use a more realistic electricity ratio
for determining primary energy
associated with electricity production
by crediting renewable energy
production on the primary side of
generation and on the on-site/delivered
side of electricity consumption. The
Department has chosen to be consistent
within their energy analyses by using
Energy Information Administration’s
(EIA) data and conversion factors solely

VerDate Mar&lt;15&gt;2010

16:34 Oct 18, 2011

Jkt 226001

and by choosing not to mix and match
conversion factors. DOE recognizes that
these conversion factors are estimates
and that some types of utility energy
inputs do not have known conversion
factors and other inputs have multiple
generally accepted conversion factors.
The Department has chosen not to
subtract primary renewable energy from
the delivered electricity losses value
because renewable energy generated as
primary energy is still subject to losses
in the delivery process to the site. Also,
DOE has chosen not to add on-site
generated renewable energy to the
delivered electricity value when
determining the electricity ratio because
on-site generated renewable energy is
not subject to the losses that are
incurred when delivering primary
energy from the plant to the site.
Therefore the delivered electricity and
delivered electricity loss values used in
the preliminary determination are the
same values used in this final
determination and yield the electricity
ratio of 3.2, explained on page 31–32 of
this notice, for converting how much
primary (source) electricity is required
per unit of site required electricity.
The Gas Technology Institute (GTI)
submitted a written comment (Docket
No. EERE–2010–BT–DET–0050–0005,
pg. 1) stating that it supports the
analysis and states that until ASHRAE
90.1 addresses issues related to full fuelcycle energy metrics and a single
baseline building budget, the DOE
preliminary determination is
incomplete and misleading.
The Department’s preliminary
determination does estimate source
energy metrics, and DOE has not chosen
to use a single baseline building budget
because there are a multitude of
building types with far different
operating requirements and
accompanying energy needs. A single
baseline building budget would
penalize certain building types while
aiding other building types depending
on how far away their respective
baseline budgets were from a single
average baseline budget.
DOE also notes that while DOE has
recently issued a notice of proposed
policy (NOPP) related to full-fuel-cycle
analysis for appliance and equipment
standards (76 FR 51281, Docket No.
EERE–2010–BT–NOA–0028, ‘‘Energy
Conservation Program for Consumer
Products and Certain Commercial and
Industrial Equipment: Statement of
Policy for Adopting Full-Fuel-Cycle
Analyses Into Energy Conservation
Standards Program’’), this policy was
not proposed for application to building
energy codes and standards such as
Standard 90.1. This policy was a direct

PO 00000

Frm 00015

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

offshoot of the National Academy of
Sciences report discussed in
conjunction with the comment below
from Laclede Gas Company. DOE notes
that GTI’s comment takes issue with
standard 90.1. DOE’s role in
determinations is to compare the latest
version of Standard 90.1 with the
previous version and to determine if the
latest version improves the level of
energy efficiency in commercial
buildings over the previous version.
While DOE is a participant in the
Standard 90.1 development process,
DOE does not control the content of
Standard 90.1.
The American Gas Association
submitted a written comment (Docket
No. EERE–2010–BT–DET–0050–0004,
pg. 1) stating that the performance
requirements for commercial electric
storage water heaters greater then 12kW
appear to be less stringent than the
current federal minimum efficiency
requirements for this class of water
heaters.
DOE acknowledges the discrepancy
between Federal standards for
commercial electric storage water
heaters and the requirements for this
equipment in Standard 90.1–2010. For
the purposes of this determination the
performance requirements for
commercial electric storage water
heaters greater than 12kW in ASHRAE
90.1–2010 are not applicable as this
determination is only concerned with
whether the 90.1–2010 version
improves the level of energy efficiency
in commercial buildings compared to
the 2007 version of 90.1, and the
performance requirements of this
equipment did not change from the
2007 to 2010 version.
The Laclede Gas Company submitted
a written comment (Docket No. EERE–
2010–BT–DET–0050–0007, pgs. 1–5)
stating the following three issues: (1)
Laclede contends there is a conflict of
interest because DOE evaluates new
versions of the ASHRAE 90.1 through
its Pacific Northwest National Lab
(PNNL), the staff of which participate in
ASHRAE committees; (2) Laclede
objects ‘‘to the site-based energy
efficiency metric because it does not
fulfill the ‘scientific integrity’ objectives
as ordered by the Presidential Scientific
Integrity Memorandum of March 9,
2009’’; and (3) Laclede is concerned that
‘‘DOE has limited its ‘Statement of
Policy’ for implementing the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) conclusions
to the minimum efficiency standards of
appliances. Laclede contends that the
NAS conclusions should also apply to
building efficiency standards.’’
In response to Laclede’s first issue,
DOE acknowledges that staff members at

E:\FR\FM\19OCN1.SGM

19OCN1

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices

emcdonald on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

PNNL participate in ASHRAE. However,
the determination analyses were
reviewed by DOE management.
In response to Laclede’s second issue,
DOE believes that its determination on
Standard 90.1–2010 has indeed
followed the requirements of the
Presidential Memorandum on Scientific
Integrity. DOE has subjected the
scientific and technological information
it considered in this determination to
well-established scientific processes and
DOE made available to the public the
scientific and technological findings
and conclusions considered or relied on
in this final determination by way of the
preliminary determination and public
comment period. DOE provides all three
metrics—site energy, source energy, and
energy cost—in its determinations. DOE
does not mandate energy efficiency
standards which give electric resistance
heat an efficiency advantage over
natural gas. DOE’s role in
determinations is to compare the latest
version of Standard 90.1 with the
previous version and to determine if the
latest version improves the level of
energy efficiency in commercial
buildings over the previous version.
In response to Laclede’s third issue,
DOE interprets the phrase ‘‘NAS
conclusions’’ to refer to the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) report
entitled ‘‘Review of Site (Point-of-Use)
and Full-Fuel-Cycle Measurement
Approaches to DOE/EERE Building
Appliance Energy-Efficiency
Standards—Letter Report (2009)
(available at http://books.nap.edu/
openbook.php?record_id=12670&amp;page=1). DOE has not limited its
‘‘Statement of Policy’’ because this NAS
report is for the application to ‘‘building
appliances’’ where DOE has statutory
authority to set building appliance
standards, and does not apply to
determinations of energy efficiency for
building energy codes. Today’s
determination is based on a review of
the work of ASHRAE, as required by
statute, and does not establish the
efficiency standards of the ASHRAE
code.
The Building Codes Assistance
Project (BCAP) submitted a written
comment (Docket No. EERE–2010–BT–
DET–0050–0003, pgs. 1–2) supporting
the DOE’s determination and suggests

that DOE follow up with the States after
publication of the Final Determination
as well as making public which States
comply with the statutory requirements
to submit certification letters within two
years of publication.
DOE does list the States that have
filed certifications and those that have
or have not adopted new codes on the
DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy Web site at http://
www.energycodes.gov/states/. Once a
State has adopted a new commercial
code, DOE typically provides software,
training, and support for the new code
as long as the new code is based on the
national model codes (in this case,
ASHRAE Standard 90.1).
The Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) submitted a written
comment (Docket No. EERE–2010–BT–
DET–0050–0006, pgs. 1–2) agreeing
with and supporting the Department’s
preliminary determination that
ASHRAE Standard 90.1–2010 saves
energy compared to ASHRAE 90.1–2007
and urges the Department to finalize
this determination.
II. Summary of the Comparative
Analysis
DOE carried out both a detailed
qualitative analysis and a broad
quantitative analysis of the differences
between the requirements and the
stringencies in the 2007 and the 2010
editions.
A. Qualitative Analysis
1. Discussion of Detailed Textual
Analysis
DOE performed a detailed analysis of
the differences between the textual
requirements and stringencies of the
2007 and 2010 editions in the scope of
the standard, the building envelope
requirements, the building lighting and
power requirements, and the building
mechanical equipment requirements.
The emphasis of DOE’s detailed
requirement and stringency analysis
was on looking at the specific changes
that ASHRAE made in going from
Standard 90.1–2007 to Standard 90.1–
2010. ASHRAE publishes changes to
their standards as addenda to the
preceding standard and then bundles all
the addenda together to form the next
edition. ASHRAE processed 109

64907

addenda to Standard 90.1–2007 to
create Standard 90.1–2010. Each of
these addenda was evaluated by DOE in
preparing this final determination. No
changes were made to the final detailed
textual analysis from the preliminary
detailed textual analysis.
In addition, each standard has
multiple ways to demonstrate
compliance, including a prescriptive set
of requirements by section of the
standard, various tradeoff approaches
within those same sections, and a whole
building performance method (Energy
Cost Budget or ECB). For each
addendum DOE identified whether it
applies to the prescriptive requirements,
or one of the tradeoff paths provided for
in the envelope, lighting, or mechanical
sections, or the ECB whole building
performance path. For each addendum
DOE identified the impact on the
stringency for that path to compliance.
Overall, DOE found that that the vast
majority of changes made to Standard
90.1–2007 to create Standard 90.1–2010
were positive or neutral (in the context
of energy efficiency). Positive changes
greatly outweighed the negative energy
efficiency changes. Specifically, of the
109 total changes:
56 were considered positive;
47 were considered neutral;
6 were considered negative.
The 56 positive changes greatly
overwhelm the 6 negative changes in
terms of a simple numerical
comparison. In addition, the 6 negative
changes were considered to be ‘‘minor
negatives’’, with 19 of the positive
changes being considered ‘‘major
positive’’ and an additional 37 positive
changes being considered ‘‘minor
positive’’. Not only do the positive
changes outweigh the negative changes
in raw numbers, but also in terms of the
estimated impact.
2. Results of Detailed Textual Analysis
Table 1 presents the results of DOE’s
addendum-by-addendum analysis of
Standard 90.1–2010. Table 6 is a
reformatted and slightly modified
version of a table in the preliminary
qualitative analysis. The complete
preliminary qualitative analysis may be
found on the DOE codes Web site at

B. Quantitative Analysis
1. Discussion of Whole Building Energy
Analysis
The quantitative comparison of
Standard 90.1–2010 was carried out
using whole-building energy
simulations of buildings built to both
Standard 90.1–2007 and Standard 90.1–
2010. DOE simulated 16 representative
building types in 15 U.S. climate
locations, each climate location selected
to be representative of one of the 15 U.S.
climate zones used in the definition of
building energy code criteria in
Standard 90.1–2007 and Standard 90.1–
2010. The simulations were developed
using specific building prototypes based
on the DOE commercial reference
building models developed for DOE’s
Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building
Initiative. (These reference building
prototypes were formerly known as
Benchmark building models). No
changes were made to the final
quantitative analysis from the
preliminary quantitative analysis.
For each building prototype simulated
in each climate the energy use

VerDate Mar&lt;15&gt;2010

16:34 Oct 18, 2011

Jkt 226001

intensities (EUI) by fuel type and by
end-use were extracted. These EUIs by
fuel type for each building were then
weighted to national average EUI figures
using weighting factors based on the
relative square footage of construction
represented by that prototype in each of
the 15 climate regions. These weighting
factors were based on commercial
building construction starts data for a
five year period from 2003 to 2007. The
source of data was the McGraw-Hill
Construction Projects Starts Database
(MHC). The MHC database captures
over 90% of new commercial
construction in any given year and the
collection process is independently
monitored to ensure the coverage of
most of the commercial construction in
the U.S. The data is used by other
federal agencies such as the U.S. Census
Bureau, the Federal Reserve and the
U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) for characterizing
building construction in the U.S. For the
purpose of developing construction
weighting factors, the strength of this
data lies in the number of samples, the
characterization of each sample in terms
of building end-use and size and
number of stories, the frequency of data
collection, and the detailed location
data. In addition, the MHC database can
be used to identify multifamily
residential buildings that would be
covered under ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
DOE’s prototypes reflect the use of
two fuel types, electricity and natural
gas. Using the weighting factors, DOE
was able to establish an estimate of the
relative reduction in building energy
use, as determined by a calculated
reduction in weighted average site EUI
for each building prototype. Site energy
refers to the energy consumed at the
building site. In a corresponding
fashion, DOE was also able to calculate
a reduction in terms of weighted average
primary EUI and in terms of weighted
average energy cost intensity (ECI) in
$/sq. ft. of building floorspace. Primary
energy as used here refers to the energy
required to generate and deliver energy
to the site. To estimate primary energy,
all electrical energy use intensities were
first converted to primary energy using
a factor of 10,918 Btus primary energy
per kWh (based on the 2010 estimated
values reported in Table 2 of the EIA
2010 Annual Energy Outlook, release
date December 2009, available at http://
www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo10/
aeoref_tab.html).
The conversion factor of 10,918 was
calculated from Table 2 by summing the
commercial electricity value of 4.62
quads with the electricity losses value of
10.17 quads and then dividing that sum
by the commercial value. ((4.62 +

PO 00000

Frm 00026

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

64917

10.17)/4.62 = 3.2) This yields an
electricity ratio of 3.2 for converting
how much primary (source) electricity
is required per unit of site required
electricity. This ratio of 3.2 is then
multiplied by 3,412 Btu per kWh,
producing a value of 10,918 Btus
primary energy per kWh of site energy.
Natural Gas EUIs in the prototypes were
converted to primary energy using a
factor of 1.090 Btus primary energy per
Btu of site natural gas use (based on the
2010 national energy use estimated
shown in Table 2 of the AEO 2010).
This natural gas source energy
conversion factor was calculated by
dividing the natural gas subtotal of
23.15 quads (sum of all natural gas
usage, including usage for natural gas
field production, leases, plant fuel, and
pipeline (compression) supply) by the
delivered natural gas total of 21.23
quads (sum of four primary energy
sectors (residential, commercial,
industrial, and transportation).
a. Calculation of Energy Cost Index
To estimate the reduction in energy
cost index, DOE relied on national
average commercial building energy
prices of $0.1026/kWh of electricity and
$10.06 per 1000 cubic feet ($0.9796/
therm) of natural gas, based on EIA
statistics for 2009 (the last complete
year of data available in Table 5B
Commercial Average Monthly Bill by
Census Division, and State—available
from EIA at http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/
electricity/esr/table5_b.html and for
2009 (the last complete year of data
available from the EIA Natural Gas
Annual Summary for the commercial
sector available at http://
tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_
dcu_nus_a.htm.) DOE recognizes that
actual fuel costs will vary somewhat by
building type within a region, and will
in fact vary more across regions.
Nevertheless, DOE believes that the use
of simple national average figures
illustrates whether there will be energy
cost savings sufficient for the purposes
of the DOE determination.
b. Calculation of Energy Use Intensities
Energy use intensities developed for
each representative building type were
weighted by total national square
footage of each representative building
type to provide an estimate of the
difference between the national energy
use in buildings constructed to the 2007
and 2010 editions of the Standard 90.1.
Note that the 16 buildings types used in
the final determination reflect
approximately 80% of the total square
footage of commercial construction
including multi-family buildings greater

E:\FR\FM\19OCN1.SGM

64918

than three stories covered under
ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
Note that only differences between
new building requirements were
considered in this quantitative analysis.
Changes to requirements in the 2010
edition that pertain to existing buildings
only are addressed in the detailed
textual analysis only.
c. Application to Additions and
Renovations
Both the 2010 and 2007 editions
address additions and renovations to
existing buildings. Since DOE has
preliminarily found insufficient data to
characterize renovations in terms of
what energy using features are utilized,
DOE has not determined that the results
obtained from the whole building
prototypes used would reasonably
reflect the EUI benefits that would
accrue to renovated floor space. For this
reason, renovated floor space is not
included in the DOE weighting factors.
Building additions on the other hand
are believed to be substantially
equivalent to new construction. For this
reason, FW Dodge construction data on
additions has been incorporated into the
overall weighting factors. Floor space
additions reflect approximately 13
percent of new construction floor space
based on data captured in the FW Dodge
dataset.
d. Ventilation Rate Assumptions
The final quantitative analysis
assumed the same base ventilation level
for buildings constructed to Standard
90.1–2007 and Standard 90.1–2010.
Neither edition of Standard 90.1
specifies ventilation rates for
commercial building construction.

ASHRAE has a separate ventilation
standard for commercial construction,
ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Ventilation for
Acceptable Indoor Air Quality. This
standard is cited only in a few
exceptions within the mechanical
sections of either Standard 90.1–2007 or
Standard 90.1–2010, with each edition
referencing a different version of
Standard 62.1. Standard 90.1–2007 lists
Standard 62.1–2004 in its table of
references. Standard 90.1–2010 lists
Standard 62.1–2007 in its table of
references.
Ventilation rates can have significant
impact on the energy use of commercial
buildings. States and local jurisdictions
typically specify the ventilation
requirements for buildings within their
respective building codes and can set
these requirements independent of the
energy code requirements. Because of
the limited reference to ventilation
within either the 2007 or the 2010
edition, the requirements that States
certify that their energy codes meet or
exceed the 2010 edition of Standard
90.1 would in general not require
modification of State ventilation code
requirements. However, in many cases,
ventilation requirements can be traced
back to requirements found in one or
another version of Standard 62.1. For
the purpose of the quantitative analysis,
DOE assumed ventilation rates for the
simulation prototypes based on the
requirements of Standard 62.1–2004.
2. Results of Whole Building Energy
Analysis
The final quantitative analysis of the
energy consumption of buildings built
to Standard 90.1–2010, as compared
with buildings built to Standard 90.1–

2007, indicates national primary energy
savings of approximately 18.2 percent of
commercial building energy
consumption based on the weighting
factors for the 16 buildings simulated.
Site energy savings are estimated to be
approximately 18.5 percent. Using
national average fuel prices for
electricity and natural gas DOE
estimated a reduction in energy
expenditures of 18.2 percent would
result from the use of Standard 90.1–
2010 as compared to Standard 90.1–
2007. As identified previously, these
estimated savings figures do not include
energy savings from equipment or
appliance standards that would be in
place due to Federal requirements
regardless of their presence in the
Standard 90.1–2010.
Tables 3 and 4 show the aggregated
energy use and associated energy
savings by building type for the 16
building prototypes analyzed and on an
aggregated national basis for the 2007
and 2010 editions, respectively. For
each edition of Standard 90.1, the
national building floor area weight used
to calculate the national impact on
building EUI or building ECI is
presented. National-average site energy
use intensities ranges from over five
hundred Btu per square foot annually
for the Fast Food prototype to
approximately 20 Btu per square foot
annually for the Non-refrigerated
Warehouse type. Source energy use
intensities and building energy cost
intensities ($/sf-yr) are also presented.

analysis can be found in the full final

C. Final Determination Statement
DOE’s review and evaluation
indicates that there are significant
differences between the 2007 edition
and the 2010 edition. DOE’s overall
final conclusion is that the 2010 edition
will improve the energy efficiency of
commercial buildings.
However, DOE identified six changes
in textual requirements that taken alone
appear to represent a reduction in
stringencies and could decrease energy
efficiency. The six changes are:
• Addendum b, which allows larger
than minimum ventilation rates if
required by other codes;

• Addendum c, which allows an
exception to dehumidification for
controls for vivariums;
• Addendum p, which increases
allowable pressure drop in laboratory
exhaust systems;
• Addendum aw, which adds an
additional lighting allowance for
nightlights in hotel/motel bathrooms;
• Addendum cc, which allows higher
flow rates in 8″ piping; and
• Addendum dc, which eliminates
tandem wiring requirements.
DOE believes that in these cases, the
reduction in stringency was not
considered a major impact. For the other
addenda, DOE determined that the

remaining addenda either represented
no change in stringency, or indicated a
positive change in stringency
corresponding to improved efficiency.
Overall, DOE concluded the changes in
textual requirements and stringencies
are ‘‘positive,’’ in the sense that they
would improve energy efficiency in
commercial construction.
The quantitative analysis shows that
for the 16 prototype buildings, a
weighted average national improvement
in new building efficiency of 16.5
percent, when considering source
energy, and by 17.1 percent, when
considering site energy.

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices

As both the 2007 and 2010 editions
cover existing buildings, to the extent
that these standards are applied to
existing buildings in retrofits or in new
construction addition, the 2010 edition
should improve the efficiency of the
existing building stock.
DOE has, therefore, concluded that
Standard 90.1–2010 receive an
affirmative determination under Section
304(b) of ECPA.
III. Filing Certification Statements With
DOE

emcdonald on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

A. Review and Update
Upon publication of this affirmative
final determination, each State is
required to review and update, as
necessary, the provisions of its
commercial building energy code to
meet or exceed the energy efficiency
provisions of the 2010 edition. (42
U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) This action is
required to be taken not later than two
years from the date of publication of this
notice of final determination, unless an
extension is provided.
The DOE recognizes that some States
do not have a State commercial building
energy code or have a State code that
does not apply to all commercial
buildings. If local building energy codes
regulate commercial building design
and construction rather than a State
code, the State must review and make
all reasonable efforts to update as
authorized those local codes to
determine whether they meet or exceed
the 2010 edition of Standard 90.1. States
may base their certifications on
reasonable actions by units of general
purpose local government. Each such
State must still review the information
obtained from the local governments
and gather any additional data and
testimony for its own certification.
Note that the applicability of any
State revisions to new or existing
buildings would be governed by the
State building codes. However, it is our
understanding that generally, the
revisions would not apply to existing
buildings unless they are undergoing a
change that requires a building permit.
States should be aware that the DOE
considers high-rise (greater than three
stories) multi-family residential
buildings, hotel, motel, and other
transient residential building types of
any height as commercial buildings for
energy code purposes. Consequently,
commercial buildings, for the purposes
of certification, would include high-rise
(greater than three stories) multi-family
residential buildings, hotel, motel, and
other transient residential building
types of any height.

Jkt 226001

B. Certification
Section 304(b) of ECPA, as amended,
requires each State to certify to the
Secretary of Energy that it has reviewed
and updated the provisions of its
commercial building energy code
regarding energy efficiency to meet or
exceed the Standard 90.1–2010 edition.
(42 U.S.C 6833(b)) Today’s final
determination is being published before
the 2 year deadline to file a certification
for the 2007 positive determination;
therefore, a state may file just one
certification to address both
determinations. The certification must
include a demonstration that the
provisions of the State’s commercial
building energy code regarding energy
efficiency meet or exceed Standard
90.1–2010. If a State intends to certify
that its commercial building energy
code already meets or exceeds the
requirements of Standard 90.1–2010, the
State should provide an explanation of
the basis for this certification, e.g.,
Standard 90.1–2010 is incorporated by
reference in the State’s building code
regulations. The chief executive of the
State (e.g., the Governor) or a designated
State official, such as the Director of the
State energy office, State code
commission, utility commission, or
equivalent State agency having primary
responsibility for commercial building
energy codes, is to provide the
certification to the Secretary. Such a
designated State official also is to
provide the certifications regarding the
codes of units of general purpose local
government based on information
provided by responsible local officials.
Certifications are to be sent to the
address provided in the ADDRESSES
section.
DOE does list the States that have
filed certifications and those that have
or have not adopted new codes on the
DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy Web site at http://
www.energycodes.gov/states/. Once a
State has adopted a new commercial
code, DOE typically provides software,
training, and support for the new code
as long as the new code is based on the
national model codes (in this case,
ASHRAE Standard 90.1).
Some States develop their own codes
that are only loosely related to the
national model codes and DOE does not
typically provide technical support for
those codes. However, DOE does
provide grants to these States through
grant programs administered by the
National Energy Technology Laboratory
(NETL). DOE does not prescribe how
each State adopts and enforces its
energy codes.

C. Request for Extensions To Certify
Section 304(c) of ECPA, requires that
the Secretary permit an extension of the
deadline for complying with the
certification requirements described
above, if a State can demonstrate that it
has made a good faith effort to comply
with such requirements and that it has
made significant progress toward
meeting its certification obligations. (42
U.S.C. 6833(c)) Such demonstrations
could include one or both of the
following: (1) A plan for response to the
requirements stated in section 304; or
(2) a statement that the State has
appropriated or requested funds (within
State funding procedures) to implement
a plan that would respond to the
requirements of Section 304 of ECPA.
This list is not exhaustive. Requests are
to be sent to the address provided in the
ADDRESSES section.
IV. Regulatory Analysis
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866
Today’s action is not a significant
regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of
Executive Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory
Planning and Review’’ (58 FR 51735;
October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today’s
action was not subject to review by the
Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB).
B. Review Under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the
preparation of an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis for any rule that by
law must be proposed for public
comment, unless the agency certifies
that the rule, if promulgated, will not
have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.
As required by Executive Order 13272,
‘‘Proper Consideration of Small Entities
in Agency Rulemaking,’’ (67 FR 53461
(Aug. 16, 2002)), DOE published
procedures and policies on February 19,
2003, to ensure that the potential
impacts of its rules on small entities are
properly considered during the
rulemaking process (68 FR 7990). DOE
has made its procedures and policies
available on the Office of General
Counsel’s Web site: http://
www.gc.doe.gov.
DOE has reviewed today’s final
determination under the provisions of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the
procedures and policies published on
February 19, 2003. Since today’s action
on the determination of improved
energy efficiency between the 2007 and
2010 editions of Standard 90.1 is now
finalized by DOE, it requires States to

E:\FR\FM\19OCN1.SGM

19OCN1

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices

emcdonald on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

undertake an analysis of their respective
building codes. As such, the only
entities directly regulated by this final
determination would be States. DOE
does not believe that there will be any
direct impacts on small entities such as
small businesses, small organizations, or
small governmental jurisdictions.
On the basis of the foregoing, DOE
certifies that this final determination
would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, DOE has not
prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis
for this final determination. DOE’s
certification and supporting statement
of factual basis will be provided to the
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 605(b).
C. Review Under the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969
Today’s action is covered under the
Categorical Exclusion found in DOE’s
National Environmental Policy Act
regulations at paragraph A.6. of
Appendix A to subpart D, 10 CFR part
1021. That Categorical Exclusion
applies to actions that are strictly
procedural, such as rulemaking
establishing the administration of
grants. Today’s action is required by
Title III of ECPA, as amended, which
provides that whenever the Standard
90.1–1989, or any successor to that
code, is revised, the Secretary must
make a determination, not later than 12
months after such revision, whether the
revised code would improve energy
efficiency in commercial buildings and
must publish notice of such
determination in the Federal Register.
(42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(A)) If the Secretary
determines that the revision of Standard
90.1–1989 or any successor thereof,
improves the level of energy efficiency
in commercial buildings then no later
than two years after the date of the
publication of such affirmative
determination, each State is required to
certify that it has reviewed and updated
the provisions of its commercial
building code regarding energy
efficiency with respect to the revised or
successor code. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) If the Secretary makes a
determination that the revised standard
will not improve energy efficiency in
commercial buildings then State
commercial codes shall meet or exceed
the last revised standard for which the
Secretary has made a positive
determination. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(ii)) Therefore, DOE has
preliminarily determined that the
Secretary’s determination is not a major
federal action that would have direct
environmental impacts. Accordingly,

VerDate Mar&lt;15&gt;2010

16:34 Oct 18, 2011

Jkt 226001

DOE has not prepared an environmental
assessment or an environmental impact
statement.
D. Review Under Executive Order
13132, ‘‘Federalism’’
Executive Order 13132, 64 FR 43255
(Aug 4, 1999), imposes certain
requirements on agencies formulating
and implementing policies or
regulations that pre-empt State law or
that have federalism implications.
Agencies are required to examine the
constitutional and statutory authority
supporting any action that would limit
the policymaking discretion of the
States and carefully assess the necessity
for such actions.
DOE has reviewed the statutory
authority. Congress found that:
(1) Large amounts of fuel and energy
are consumed unnecessarily each year
in heating, cooling, ventilating, and
providing domestic hot water for newly
constructed residential and commercial
buildings because such buildings lack
adequate energy conservation features;
(2) Federal voluntary performance
standards for newly constructed
buildings can prevent such waste of
energy, which the Nation can no longer
afford in view of its current and
anticipated energy shortage;
(3) the failure to provide adequate
energy conservation measures in newly
constructed buildings increases longterm operating costs that may affect
adversely the repayment of, and security
for, loans made, insured, or guaranteed
by Federal agencies or made by
federally insured or regulated
instrumentalities; and
(4) State and local building codes or
similar controls can provide an existing
means by which to assure, in
coordination with other building
requirements and with a minimum of
Federal interference in State and local
transactions, that newly constructed
buildings contain adequate energy
conservation features. (42 U.S.C. 6831)
Pursuant to Section 304(b) of ECPA,
DOE is statutorily required to determine
whether the most recent versions of
ASHRAE 90.1 would improve the level
of energy efficiency in commercial
buildings as compared to the previous
version. If DOE makes a positive
determination, the statute requires each
State to certify that it has reviewed and
updated the provisions of its
commercial building code regarding
energy efficiency with respect to the
revised or successor codes. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(i))
Executive Order 13132, 64 FR 43255
(August 4, 1999) requires meaningful
and timely input by State and local
officials in the development of

PO 00000

Frm 00030

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

64921

regulatory policies that have federalism
implications unless ‘‘funds necessary to
pay the direct costs incurred by the
State and local governments in
complying with the regulation are
provided by the Federal Government.’’
(62 FR 43257) Pursuant to section 304(e)
of ECPA, the DOE Secretary is required
to ‘‘provide incentive funding to States
to implement the requirements of
[Section 304], and to improve and
implement State residential and
commercial building energy efficiency
codes, including increasing and
verifying compliance with such codes.
In determining whether, and in what
amount, to provide incentive funding
under this subsection, the Secretary
shall consider the actions proposed by
the State to implement the requirements
of this section, to improve and
implement residential and commercial
building energy efficiency codes, and to
promote building energy efficiency
through the use of such codes.’’ (42
U.S.C. 6833(e)) Therefore, consultation
with States and local officials regarding
this final determination was not
required.
However, DOE notes that State and
local governments were invited to
participate in the development Standard
90.1–2010. Standard 90.1–2010, was
developed in a national ANSI consensus
process open to the public and in which
State and local governments participate
along with DOE and other interested
parties. It is the product of a series of
amendments to the prior addition of the
standard. Each addendum is put out for
national public review. Anyone may
submit comments, and in the process
comments were received from State and
local governments. Comments on the
addendum are received, reviewed and
resolved through a consensus process.
Members of the standards project
committee have included
representatives of State and local
governments.
DOE annually holds a national
building energy codes workshop at
which the progress on development of
the model energy codes are presented,
along with discussion and sharing of
problems and successes in adoption,
implementation, and enforcement of
building energy codes. The predominate
attendance of these workshops are State
and local officials responsible for
building energy codes. They are
consistently encouraged and urged to
participate in the model building energy
code processes, which will be the
subject of DOE’s next determinations
under section 304 of ECPA. Thus, State
and local officials have had the
opportunity to participate in the
development of the standard through

E:\FR\FM\19OCN1.SGM

19OCN1

64922

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices

emcdonald on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

the ASHRAE process. Some have done
so.
Similarly, the comments of States and
local governments about provisions of
the developing Standard 90.1–2010
were received in formal comment
periods and heard and addressed in
ASHRAE committee deliberations open
to the public. In addition, concerns and
issues about adoption, implementation
and enforcement issues were presented
and discussed at informal sessions at
the Department’s annual national
workshops on building energy codes.
DOE believes that the above process has
given State and local jurisdictions
extensive opportunity to comment on
and express their concerns on Standard
90.1–2010, the subject of this
determination.
On issuance of a final determination
that Standard 90.1–2010 would improve
the energy efficiency of commercial
buildings, ECPA requires the States to
certify to the Secretary that it has
reviewed and updated the provisions of
its commercial building code regarding
energy efficiency to meet or exceed the
requirements of Standard 90.1–2010.
DOE notes that ECPA sets forth this
requirement for States. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) States are given broad
freedom to either adopt Standard 90.1–
2010 or develop their own code that
meets equivalent energy efficiency.
E. Review Under the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) generally
requires Federal agencies to examine
closely the impacts of regulatory actions
on State, local, and tribal governments.
Subsection 101(5) of Title I of that law
defines a Federal intergovernmental
mandate to include any regulation that
would impose upon State, local, or
tribal governments an enforceable duty,
except a condition of Federal assistance
or a duty arising from participating in a
voluntary Federal program. Title II of
that law requires each Federal agency to
assess the effects of Federal regulatory
actions on State, local, and tribal
governments, in the aggregate, or to the
private sector, other than to the extent
such actions merely incorporate
requirements specifically set forth in a
statute. Section 202 of that title requires
a Federal agency to perform a detailed
assessment of the anticipated costs and
benefits of any rule that includes a
Federal mandate which may result in
costs to State, local, or tribal
governments, or to the private sector, of
$100 million or more. Section 204 of
that title requires each agency that
proposes a rule containing a significant
Federal intergovernmental mandate to

VerDate Mar&lt;15&gt;2010

16:34 Oct 18, 2011

Jkt 226001

develop an effective process for
obtaining meaningful and timely input
from elected officers of State, local, and
tribal governments.
Upon publication of this affirmative
final determination, each State is
required under section 304 of ECPA to
review and update, as necessary, the
provisions of its commercial building
energy code to meet or exceed the
provisions of the 2010 edition of
Standard 90.1. (42 U.S.C.
6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) Section 304 of ECPA
requires State action in response to this
positive determination by DOE. The
statutory requirements of ECPA require
DOE to provide a determination
irrespective of costs. While the
processes that States may undertake to
update their codes vary widely, as a
general rule a State at a minimum needs
to:
• Evaluate Standard 90.1–2010 using
the background material provided by
DOE
• Compare the existing State
commercial building energy code to
Standard 90.1–2010 to see if an update
is needed
• Update the State commercial
building energy code to meet or exceed
Standard 90.1–2010.
DOE evaluated the potential for State
activity to exceed $100 million in any
one year. The approach looked at the
three steps for minimum activity listed
in the previous paragraph—evaluate,
compare and update. A fourth potential
step of providing training on the new
code was also considered as some States
may consider training on the new code
to be an integral part of adopting the
new code. For the three steps of
minimum activity, DOE estimated the
following:
Evaluate Standard 90.1–2010—DOE
estimated a minimum of 8 hours of
review per State and a maximum review
time of 500 hours of review per State
(12.5 work weeks). The minimum
review time of 8 hours (one day) is the
estimated minimum amount of time
DOE can see States taking to review
Standard 90.1–2010. Reading and
reviewing the Federal Register notice,
the qualitative analysis document and
the quantitative analysis document will
take the average person several hours.
Deciding on whether or not to upgrade
to Standard 90.1–2010 may take another
couple of hours. The maximum review
time of 500 hours (62.5 day, 3 working
months) upper limit was estimated as
the amount of time that a State that was
not familiar with energy codes at all or
which has a particularly arduous review
process within the State would take to
review these documents.

(1) A cost per hour of $100 per hour
was assumed based on actual rates
proposed in subcontracts associated
with compliance studies funded by
DOE. The average rate calculated from
these subcontracts for 10 types of
building officials from 6 states was
$93.41, so DOE chose to round this up
to $100 per hour.
a. Low estimate—8 hours × 50 states ×
$100 per hour = $40,000.
b. High estimate—500 hours × 50 states
× $100 per hour = $2,500,000.
(2) Compare Standard 90.1–2010 to
existing state code—Assuming the State
is familiar with its code and has
performed an effective evaluation of
Standard 90.1 in the first step, the range
of potential costs should be similar to
Step 1. (See Step 1 for discussion of 8
hour and 500 hour times and $100 per
hour cost estimate).
a. Low estimate—8 hours × 50 states ×
$100 per hour = $40,000.
b. High estimate—500 hours × 50 states
× $100 per hour = $2,500,000.
(3) Update the State Codes to meet or
exceed Standard 90.1–2010—Adopting
a new energy code could be as simple
as updating an order within the State, or
it could be very complex involving
hearings, testimony, etc. Again, the
range of potential costs should be
similar to Step 1. (See Step 1 for
discussion of origin of 8 hour and 500
hour times and $100 per hour cost
estimate).
a. Low estimate—8 hours × 50 states ×
$100 per hour = $40,000.
b. High estimate—500 hours × 50 states
× $100 per hour = $2,500,000.
The potential range of total costs
States to under these assumptions
would be $120,000 to $7.5 million. This
range is well below the $100 million
threshold in the Unfunded Mandates
Act. DOE has also considered potential
costs were States to provide training on
the new code.
(4) Train Code officials on New
Code—Assuming every jurisdiction has
at least one person that needs to be
trained on energy code. There are
roughly 40,000 general purpose local
governments, or jurisdictions, in the
U.S.. The total number of jurisdictions
in the U.S. that enforce energy codes is
not known with any degree of certainty.
The National League of Cities publishes
an estimate of the number of local
governments in the U.S. at http://
www.nlc.org/build-skills-networks/
resources/cities-101/number-of-localgovernments—population-distribution.
Their summary indicates the following:
• 19,492 Municipal governments;
• 16,519 Town or Township
governments;

E:\FR\FM\19OCN1.SGM

19OCN1

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 202 / Wednesday, October 19, 2011 / Notices
• 3,033 County governments;
• 13,726 School districts; and
• 37,381 Special district
governments.
(5) DOE believes it is reasonable to
assume that all of the municipal
governments, town or township
governments, and county governments
could be required to acquire training on
Standard 90.1–2010 in order to enforce
this standard as an adopted energy code.
In addition, the 50 state governments
would be required to acquire training.
This number adds up to
19,429+16,504+3,033+50 = 39,094.
Another widely mentioned estimate of
the total number of code adopting
jurisdictions in the U.S. is 44,000. This
number is based on the National
Conference of States on Building Codes
and Standards (NCBCS). See, for
example, http://www.ncsbcs.org/
newsite/New%20Releases/
RW_Presentation_060602.htm. Both
these estimates are in reasonable
agreement and so DOE assumed that
there are 40,000 potential jurisdictions
that potentially would need training on
a new energy code.
Based on training experiences of the
Building Energy Codes Program staff,
with conducting training sessions for
jurisdictional staff regarding Standard
90.1, one full-day (8 hours) of training
is normally sufficient. Therefore, DOE
has used 8 hours as a low estimate and
16 hours as a high estimate for training
hours required if a jurisdiction were to
adopt Standard 90.1–2010.
a. Low estimate—8 hours × 40,000
jurisdictions × $100 per hour =
$32,000,000.
b. High Estimate—16 hours × 40,000
jurisdictions × $100 per hour =
$64,000,000.

Accordingly, DOE has concluded that it
is not necessary to prepare a Family
Policymaking Assessment.
G. Review Under the Treasury and
General Government Appropriations
Act of 2001
Section 515 of the Treasury and
General Government Appropriations
Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516, note)
provides for agencies to review most
disseminations of information to the
public under guidelines established by
each agency pursuant to general
guidelines issued by OMB. OMB’s
guidelines were published at 67 FR
8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), and DOE’s
guidelines were published at 67 FR
62446 (Oct. 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed
today’s action under the OMB and DOE
guidelines and has concluded that it is
consistent with applicable policies in
those guidelines.

F. Review Under the Treasury and
General Government Appropriations
Act of 1999

H. Review Under Executive Order 13211
Executive Order 13211, ‘‘Actions
Concerning Regulations That
Significantly Affect Energy Supply,
Distribution, or Use,’’ 66 FR 28355 (May
22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to
prepare and submit to the OMB a
Statement of Energy Effects for any
proposed significant energy action. A
‘‘significant energy action’’ is defined as
any action by an agency that
promulgated or is expected to lead to
promulgation of a final rule, and that:
(1) Is a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866, or any
successor order; and (2) Is likely to have
a significant adverse effect on the
supply, distribution, or use of energy; or
(3) Is designated by the Administrator of
the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs (OIRA) as a significant energy
action. For any proposed significant
energy action, the agency must give a
detailed statement of any adverse effects
on energy supply, distribution, or use,
should the proposal be implemented,
and of reasonable alternatives to the
action and their expected benefits on
energy supply, distribution, and use.
Today’s action would not have a
significant adverse effect on the supply,
distribution, or use of energy and is
therefore not a significant energy action.
Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a
Statement of Energy Effects.

Section 654 of the Treasury and
General Government Appropriations
Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105–277) requires
Federal agencies to issue a Family
Policymaking Assessment for any rule
that may affect family well-being.
Today’s action would not have any
impact on the autonomy or integrity of
the family as an institution.

I. Review Under Executive Order 13175
Executive Order 13175. ‘‘Consultation
and Coordination with Indian tribal
Governments’’ (65 FR 67249 (Nov. 9,
2000)), requires DOE to develop an
accountable process to ensure
‘‘meaningful and timely input by tribal
officials in the development of
regulatory policies that have tribal

emcdonald on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

Adding the potential training costs of
$32 million to $64 million to the costs
for the three steps indicates a potential
total costs ranging from $32.12 million
to $71.5 million. The high end of this
estimate is less than the $100 million
threshold in the Unfunded Mandates
Act. Accordingly, no further action is
required under the Unfunded Mandates
Reform Act of 1995.

Building Energy Standards Program: Final Determination Regarding 
Energy Efficiency Improvements in the Energy Standard for Buildings, 
Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-
2010

AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of 
Energy.

ACTION: Notice of final determination.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) has determined 
that the 2010 edition of the Energy Standard for Buildings, Except Low-
Rise Residential Buildings, American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI)/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE) Illuminating Engineering Society of North America 
(IESNA) Standard 90.1-2010, (Standard 90.1-2010 or the 2010 edition) 
would achieve greater energy efficiency in buildings subject to the 
code, than the 2007 edition (Standard 90.1-2007 or the 2007 edition). 
Also, DOE has determined that the quantitative analysis of the energy 
consumption of buildings built to Standard 90.1-2010, as compared with 
buildings built to Standard 90.1-2007, indicates national source energy 
savings of approximately 18.2 percent of commercial building energy 
consumption. Additionally, DOE has determined site energy savings are 
estimated to be approximately 18.5 percent. Upon publication of this 
affirmative final determination, States are required to certify that 
they have reviewed the provisions of their commercial building code 
regarding energy efficiency, and as necessary, updated their code to 
meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2010. Additionally, this notice provides 
guidance to States on Certifications, and Requests for Extensions of 
Deadlines for Certification Statements.

DATES: Certification statements by the States must be provided by 
October 18, 2013.

ADDRESSES: Certification Statements must be addressed to the Buildings 
Technologies Program-Building Energy Codes Program Manager, U.S.

I. Introduction

A. Statutory Requirements

 Title III of the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as amended 
(ECPA), establishes requirements for the

[[Page 64905]]

Building Energy Efficiency Standards Program. (42 U.S.C. 6831 et seq.) 
Section 304(b), as amended, of ECPA provides that whenever the ANSI/
ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1989 (Standard 90.1-1989 or 1989 edition), 
or any successor to that code, is revised, the Secretary must make a 
determination, not later than 12 months after such revision, whether 
the revised code would improve energy efficiency in commercial 
buildings and must publish notice of such determination in the Federal 
Register. (42 U.S.C. 6833 (b)(2)(A)) The Secretary may determine that 
the revision of Standard 90.1-1989 or any successor thereof, improves 
the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings. If so, then not 
later than two years after the date of the publication of such 
affirmative determination, each State is required to certify that it 
has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code 
regarding energy efficiency with respect to the revised or successor 
code. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) The State must include in its 
certification a demonstration that the provisions of its commercial 
building code, regarding energy efficiency, meet or exceed the revised 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i))
 If the Secretary makes a determination that the revised standard 
will not improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, State 
commercial codes must meet or exceed the last revised standard for 
which the Secretary has made a positive determination. (42 U.S.C. 
6833(b)(2)(B)(ii)). On July 20, 2011, the DOE published a determination 
in the Federal Register updating the reference code to Standard 90.1-
2007. See 76 FR 43287 (July 20, 2011).
 ECPA also requires the Secretary to permit extensions of the 
deadlines for the State certification if a State can demonstrate that 
it has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of 
section 304(c) of ECPA and that it has made significant progress in 
doing so. (42 U.S.C. 6833(c))

B. Background

1. Publication of Standard 90.1-2010
 ASHRAE and the IESNA approved the publication of the 2010 edition 
of Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-rise Residential Buildings, 
in October 2010.
 The Standard was developed under ANSI-approved consensus standard 
procedures. Standard 90.1 is under continuous maintenance by a Standing 
Standard Project Committee (SSPC) for which the ASHRAE Standard 
Committee has established a documented program for regular publication 
of addenda or revisions, including procedures for timely, documented, 
consensus action on requests for change to any part of the standard. 
ANSI approves addenda prior to their publication by ASHRAE and IESNA 
and prior to their inclusion in a new version of Standard 90.1. ANSI 
approved the final addendum for inclusion in Standard 90.1-2010 on July 
24, 2010. Appeals were made to several addenda and the results of the 
appeals process were not final until October 15, 2010. The 2010 edition 
was published on October 28, 2010.
2. Preliminary Determination
 In arriving at a preliminary determination, DOE first reviewed all 
significant changes between the 2010 edition and the 2007 edition. 
Standard 90.1 is complex and covers a broad spectrum of the energy 
related components and systems in buildings ranging from simple storage 
buildings to complex hospitals and laboratories. The size of buildings 
addressed range from those smaller than single family homes to the 
largest buildings in the world. The approach to development of the 
standard used in the 2010 edition was not changed from that used for 
the 2007 edition, with no changes to the scope or the way components 
are defined. DOE preliminarily determined that because no significant 
changes were made to the structure, scope, or component definitions of 
Standard 90.1-2007, a similar methodology used for the analysis of 
Standard 90.1-2007 could be utilized for the analysis of Standard 90.1-
2010, consisting of a qualitative comparison of the textual changes to 
requirements in Standard 90.1-2010 from Standard 90.1-2007, and a 
quantitative estimate of the energy savings developed from whole 
building simulations of a standard set of buildings constructed to both 
Standards over a range of U.S. climates. DOE used an extension of the 
procedure used for the Standard 90.1-2007 determination for the 
quantitative estimate of energy savings. The extension was that 
additional building types were added to the analysis. DOE used the same 
simulation tool and data for weighing the results by building type and 
climate as used for the 90.1-2007 determination.
 A detailed discussion of the analysis methodology, which was 
subject to public comment in 2010 and 2011, can be found in the Notice 
of Preliminary Determination for Standard 90.1-2007 and in the Notice 
of Preliminary Determination for Standard 90.1-2010. 75 FR 54117 (Sept. 
3, 2010) and 76 FR 43299 (July 20, 2011) respectively.
3. Public Comments Regarding the Preliminary Determination
 DOE accepted public comments on the preliminary determination for 
Standard 90.1-2010 until August 19, 2011. DOE received submissions from 
a total of six different entities.
 The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) submitted a written comment 
(Docket No. EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0002, pgs. 1-3) supporting the 
preliminary determination while stating the following four issues: (1) 
DOE should only use the results from its site energy analysis and its 
energy cost analysis to make its final determination, and not report 
the source energy analysis results in the final determination, (2) the 
energy savings, or at least a portion of the estimated energy savings, 
from addenda that include new federal energy efficiency standards or 
provide updates to energy efficiency standards should be incorporated 
into the final determination analysis, (3) EEI would request that the 
information about the impact of addendum ``bu&apos;&apos; be included in the 
final determination notice, and (4) in terms of primary energy 
associated with electricity, the value in this notice is overstated and 
that DOE should use a more realistic ratio for electricity in its 
estimates.
 In regards to EEI&apos;s first comment, the Department still believes 
that despite the fact that the source energy analysis results are 
estimates, it is important to the discussion of global resources and 
environmental issues to report them. Source energy (or primary energy) 
addresses the energy needed to deliver energy to the building in 
addition to the energy used at the building and thus provides a more 
complete view of the total energy expenditure used by a building than 
site energy. However, DOE realizes that site energy is the energy that 
typically appears on utility bills and that is seen by the consumer. 
DOE also realizes that it is energy cost (as shown on energy bills) to 
which many consumers react. It is for this reason that DOE provides all 
three metrics--site energy, source energy, and energy cost--in its 
determinations.
 EEI&apos;s second comment is in reference to the fact that the 
Department does not include the impact from new or updated federal 
energy efficiency standards in its determination of energy savings. For 
the quantitative analysis performed for the 90.1-2010 preliminary 
determination ( http://www.energycodes.gov/status/documents/QuantitativeAnalysisReport901-2010Determination.pdf ), DOE

[[Page 64906]]

incorporated only addenda that modified the prescriptive requirements 
of the Standard. New or updated federal efficiency standards are not 
independent requirements of the standard, but rather reflections of 
Federal manufacturing requirements. In specific circumstances, 
particularly with regard to requirements for certain heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, addenda to Standard 
90.1-2010 reflect changes to national manufacturing standards 
previously developed by DOE or enacted independently through Federal 
legislation. The energy savings that are attributable to these national 
manufacturing standards would accrue no matter what version of Standard 
90.1 is considered and regardless of whether they are reflected in the 
text of the Standards, therefore DOE has not incorporated these as 
changes contributing to energy savings for the purpose of the 
Determination.
 EEI&apos;s third comment requests that information regarding the impact 
of addendum ``bu&apos;&apos; be included in the final determination. Addendum 
``bu&apos;&apos; added equipment efficiency requirements for mechanical equipment 
serving computer rooms, however none of the prototype building models 
that DOE uses in its simulations have data centers and therefore the 
quantifiable impact of this addendum was not captured. DOE does note 
that the impact of addendum ``bu&apos;&apos; is captured in the qualitative, or 
text comparison analysis, where addendum ``bu&apos;&apos; is listed as a major 
positive and noted as a new efficiency requirement. When the prototype 
building models used in this determination were developed by DOE and 
later reviewed by ASHRAE, no data center models were included because 
at that point Standard 90.1 did not include efficiency requirements 
related to data centers. DOE did not add data centers to the prototype 
building models for this determination because the quantitative impact 
of this addendum would not change the fact that this is a positive 
final determination of energy savings. DOE is considering adding data 
centers to the prototype building models for future determinations.
 EEI&apos;s final comment suggests that DOE use a more realistic 
electricity ratio for determining primary energy associated with 
electricity production by crediting renewable energy production on the 
primary side of generation and on the on-site/delivered side of 
electricity consumption. The Department has chosen to be consistent 
within their energy analyses by using Energy Information 
Administration&apos;s (EIA) data and conversion factors solely and by 
choosing not to mix and match conversion factors. DOE recognizes that 
these conversion factors are estimates and that some types of utility 
energy inputs do not have known conversion factors and other inputs 
have multiple generally accepted conversion factors. The Department has 
chosen not to subtract primary renewable energy from the delivered 
electricity losses value because renewable energy generated as primary 
energy is still subject to losses in the delivery process to the site. 
Also, DOE has chosen not to add on-site generated renewable energy to 
the delivered electricity value when determining the electricity ratio 
because on-site generated renewable energy is not subject to the losses 
that are incurred when delivering primary energy from the plant to the 
site. Therefore the delivered electricity and delivered electricity 
loss values used in the preliminary determination are the same values 
used in this final determination and yield the electricity ratio of 
3.2, explained on page 31-32 of this notice, for converting how much 
primary (source) electricity is required per unit of site required 
electricity.
 The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) submitted a written comment 
(Docket No. EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0005, pg. 1) stating that it supports 
the analysis and states that until ASHRAE 90.1 addresses issues related 
to full fuel-cycle energy metrics and a single baseline building 
budget, the DOE preliminary determination is incomplete and misleading.
 The Department&apos;s preliminary determination does estimate source 
energy metrics, and DOE has not chosen to use a single baseline 
building budget because there are a multitude of building types with 
far different operating requirements and accompanying energy needs. A 
single baseline building budget would penalize certain building types 
while aiding other building types depending on how far away their 
respective baseline budgets were from a single average baseline budget.
 DOE also notes that while DOE has recently issued a notice of 
proposed policy (NOPP) related to full-fuel-cycle analysis for 
appliance and equipment standards (76 FR 51281, Docket No. EERE-2010-
BT-NOA-0028, ``Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products and 
Certain Commercial and Industrial Equipment: Statement of Policy for 
Adopting Full-Fuel-Cycle Analyses Into Energy Conservation Standards 
Program&apos;&apos;), this policy was not proposed for application to building 
energy codes and standards such as Standard 90.1. This policy was a 
direct offshoot of the National Academy of Sciences report discussed in 
conjunction with the comment below from Laclede Gas Company. DOE notes 
that GTI&apos;s comment takes issue with standard 90.1. DOE&apos;s role in 
determinations is to compare the latest version of Standard 90.1 with 
the previous version and to determine if the latest version improves 
the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings over the 
previous version. While DOE is a participant in the Standard 90.1 
development process, DOE does not control the content of Standard 90.1.
 The American Gas Association submitted a written comment (Docket 
No. EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0004, pg. 1) stating that the performance 
requirements for commercial electric storage water heaters greater then 
12kW appear to be less stringent than the current federal minimum 
efficiency requirements for this class of water heaters.
 DOE acknowledges the discrepancy between Federal standards for 
commercial electric storage water heaters and the requirements for this 
equipment in Standard 90.1-2010. For the purposes of this determination 
the performance requirements for commercial electric storage water 
heaters greater than 12kW in ASHRAE 90.1-2010 are not applicable as 
this determination is only concerned with whether the 90.1-2010 version 
improves the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings 
compared to the 2007 version of 90.1, and the performance requirements 
of this equipment did not change from the 2007 to 2010 version.
 The Laclede Gas Company submitted a written comment (Docket No. 
EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0007, pgs. 1-5) stating the following three 
issues: (1) Laclede contends there is a conflict of interest because 
DOE evaluates new versions of the ASHRAE 90.1 through its Pacific 
Northwest National Lab (PNNL), the staff of which participate in ASHRAE 
committees; (2) Laclede objects ``to the site-based energy efficiency 
metric because it does not fulfill the `scientific integrity&apos; 
objectives as ordered by the Presidential Scientific Integrity 
Memorandum of March 9, 2009&apos;&apos;; and (3) Laclede is concerned that ``DOE 
has limited its `Statement of Policy&apos; for implementing the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS) conclusions to the minimum efficiency 
standards of appliances. Laclede contends that the NAS conclusions 
should also apply to building efficiency standards.&apos;&apos;
 In response to Laclede&apos;s first issue, DOE acknowledges that staff 
members at

[[Page 64907]]

PNNL participate in ASHRAE. However, the determination analyses were 
reviewed by DOE management.
 In response to Laclede&apos;s second issue, DOE believes that its 
determination on Standard 90.1-2010 has indeed followed the 
requirements of the Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity. 
DOE has subjected the scientific and technological information it 
considered in this determination to well-established scientific 
processes and DOE made available to the public the scientific and 
technological findings and conclusions considered or relied on in this 
final determination by way of the preliminary determination and public 
comment period. DOE provides all three metrics--site energy, source 
energy, and energy cost--in its determinations. DOE does not mandate 
energy efficiency standards which give electric resistance heat an 
efficiency advantage over natural gas. DOE&apos;s role in determinations is 
to compare the latest version of Standard 90.1 with the previous 
version and to determine if the latest version improves the level of 
energy efficiency in commercial buildings over the previous version.
 In response to Laclede&apos;s third issue, DOE interprets the phrase 
``NAS conclusions&apos;&apos; to refer to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 
report entitled ``Review of Site (Point-of-Use) and Full-Fuel-Cycle 
Measurement Approaches to DOE/EERE Building Appliance Energy-Efficiency 
Standards--Letter Report (2009) (available at http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12670&amp;page;=1 ). DOE has not limited its 
``Statement of Policy&apos;&apos; because this NAS report is for the application 
to ``building appliances&apos;&apos; where DOE has statutory authority to set 
building appliance standards, and does not apply to determinations of 
energy efficiency for building energy codes. Today&apos;s determination is 
based on a review of the work of ASHRAE, as required by statute, and 
does not establish the efficiency standards of the ASHRAE code.
 The Building Codes Assistance Project (BCAP) submitted a written 
comment (Docket No. EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0003, pgs. 1-2) supporting 
the DOE&apos;s determination and suggests that DOE follow up with the States 
after publication of the Final Determination as well as making public 
which States comply with the statutory requirements to submit 
certification letters within two years of publication.
 DOE does list the States that have filed certifications and those 
that have or have not adopted new codes on the DOE Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy Web site at http://www.energycodes.gov/states/ . 
Once a State has adopted a new commercial code, DOE typically provides 
software, training, and support for the new code as long as the new 
code is based on the national model codes (in this case, ASHRAE 
Standard 90.1).
 The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) submitted a written 
comment (Docket No. EERE-2010-BT-DET-0050-0006, pgs. 1-2) agreeing with 
and supporting the Department&apos;s preliminary determination that ASHRAE 
Standard 90.1-2010 saves energy compared to ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and urges 
the Department to finalize this determination.

II. Summary of the Comparative Analysis

 DOE carried out both a detailed qualitative analysis and a broad 
quantitative analysis of the differences between the requirements and 
the stringencies in the 2007 and the 2010 editions.

A. Qualitative Analysis

1. Discussion of Detailed Textual Analysis
 DOE performed a detailed analysis of the differences between the 
textual requirements and stringencies of the 2007 and 2010 editions in 
the scope of the standard, the building envelope requirements, the 
building lighting and power requirements, and the building mechanical 
equipment requirements.
 The emphasis of DOE&apos;s detailed requirement and stringency analysis 
was on looking at the specific changes that ASHRAE made in going from 
Standard 90.1-2007 to Standard 90.1-2010. ASHRAE publishes changes to 
their standards as addenda to the preceding standard and then bundles 
all the addenda together to form the next edition. ASHRAE processed 109 
addenda to Standard 90.1-2007 to create Standard 90.1-2010. Each of 
these addenda was evaluated by DOE in preparing this final 
determination. No changes were made to the final detailed textual 
analysis from the preliminary detailed textual analysis.
 In addition, each standard has multiple ways to demonstrate 
compliance, including a prescriptive set of requirements by section of 
the standard, various tradeoff approaches within those same sections, 
and a whole building performance method (Energy Cost Budget or ECB). 
For each addendum DOE identified whether it applies to the prescriptive 
requirements, or one of the tradeoff paths provided for in the 
envelope, lighting, or mechanical sections, or the ECB whole building 
performance path. For each addendum DOE identified the impact on the 
stringency for that path to compliance.
 Overall, DOE found that that the vast majority of changes made to 
Standard 90.1-2007 to create Standard 90.1-2010 were positive or 
neutral (in the context of energy efficiency). Positive changes greatly 
outweighed the negative energy efficiency changes. Specifically, of the 
109 total changes:
 56 were considered positive;
 47 were considered neutral;
 6 were considered negative.
 The 56 positive changes greatly overwhelm the 6 negative changes in 
terms of a simple numerical comparison. In addition, the 6 negative 
changes were considered to be ``minor negatives&apos;&apos;, with 19 of the 
positive changes being considered ``major positive&apos;&apos; and an additional 
37 positive changes being considered ``minor positive&apos;&apos;. Not only do 
the positive changes outweigh the negative changes in raw numbers, but 
also in terms of the estimated impact.
2. Results of Detailed Textual Analysis
 Table 1 presents the results of DOE&apos;s addendum-by-addendum analysis 
of Standard 90.1-2010. Table 6 is a reformatted and slightly modified 
version of a table in the preliminary qualitative analysis. The 
complete preliminary qualitative analysis may be found on the DOE codes
