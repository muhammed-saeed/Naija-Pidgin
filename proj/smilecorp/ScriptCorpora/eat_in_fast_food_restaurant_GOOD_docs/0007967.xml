Tiffany Studios 16&quot; Woodbine on Green Lampshade Reproduction Package This plant, which belongs to the Honeysuckle family and is better known as Virginia Creeper, is represented by both a 14&quot; version and a 16&quot; version in the Tiffany col-lection.

Featured are the vividly colored five-fold clusters of leaves in the absence of flowers. They occupy the lower portion of the shade, which has no lower border row. The typi-cal five-fold leaves of the plant appear in a variety of colors: some are pink, with strong red striations, some white with pur-ple mottling, others green with orange striations; and the newcomers are orange with red streaks.

The background is green with yellow streaks, similar to the coloration of some of the leaves.

You will enjoy the challenge of this project, because when you have finished, you will have an heirloom which you will proudly cherish for years to come.

THE MATERIALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE OFFERED AS A COMPLETE PACKAGE. THEY INCLUDE THE LAMP FORM, THE COLOR CODED PATTERN, THE GLASS IN UNCUT SHEETS, AND A COLOR PRINT. THEY DO NOT INCLUDE FOIL, SOLDER OR FLUX.

Our full sized pattern is accurately copied from the eight color illustration on page 87 of Dr. Egon Neustadt&apos;s book, THE LAMPS OF TIFFANY. Our lamp form will allow you to build the lampshade to the proper shape, and allow you to make corrections as you go along so that you can make step by step checks of the color selection and the fine line work to your own satisfaction .

OUR GLASS PACKAGE CONSISTS MAINLY OF GLASS FROM THE YOUGHIOGENY STIPPLE GLASS PALETTE, WHICH CLOSELY APPROXIMATES THE COLORS AND MOTTLING OF THE ORIGINAL. Tiffany Reproduction Black-Eyed Susan 16&quot; Globe (#6230) Lampshade Kit with Form In the Black-Eyed Susan, the flowers are brilliant orange and taper off to pale yellow. Some are shown head-on, others in a side view. The foliage is a dark green which contrasts with the lighter green of the background.

The lamp base in the illustration is not now available. A 14 or 15 inch base is suggested, which you can choose from our catalog Section M.

This joyous pair are cavorting at their local Mac Donald&apos;s fast food restaurant. They have just scanned the supper offerings and celebrate their discovery that pork is not on the bill of fare.

One hopes that they will not come back on the morrow and notice the listing for Sausage McMuffin.

You may also wonder if the fiddle bow is made of cat-gut.

This cheerful scene is perfect for a window in a child&apos;s room, or in a den where you might be slaving over a computer keyboard. &quot;Life is just a bowl of Pig Jigs&quot;. $48.00 0844

W-D Stained Glass Pelican Pete Fun Pack Window Hanging Kit How many times have you wanted to do a stained glass project but didn&apos;t start because it seemed too complicated and time-consuming?

This 14&quot; x 20&quot; panel depicts one of our feathered friends (or rather one of your feathered friends. We no longer have any feathered friends since an unfortunate accident during a certain 1983 Easter egg hunt.)

President Woodrow Wilson is said to have composed the following limerick:

A wonderful bird is the pelican.
His beak can hold more than his belican
He can hold in his beak
Enough for a week,
And one wonders just how in the helican.

Whether or not President Wilson wrote the limerick, he was not referring to Pete, our pelican. Pete has been on an a fad diet and is having trouble with the part about avoiding shell fish during months whose names include the letter &quot;E&quot;. (Or is it &quot;A&quot;?) We expect that the diet or Pete will soon come to an end, so we suggest that you sort of expand the beak area to a more normal proportion. $26.47 0441

This charming stained glass window depicts two cats who, it is evident, are having a dialog. The Outside Cat is apparently offering a deal to which the Inside Cat is listening with more than the normal amount of catlike curiosity. One can only imagine the diabolical bacchanal which Outside is proposing to Inside. Do you suppose that Outside is a Tomcat, and Inside is a prim and proper Housecat? Is it possible? If you can suppress your disgust, we are sure you will enjoy constructing this stained glass panel to hang in your kitchen window. $35.50 0690

This stained glass panel is perfect for a den or recreation room.

These charming characters have just returned from the annual Teddy Bear&apos;s Picnic. Having imbibed certain libations, and enormous helpings of deviled eggs, ham sandwiches, tuna fish salad, dill pickles, chips and dips, apples, pears, grapes and chocolate cream pie, they have collapsed into a somnolent heap. The only sounds emanating from this contented pile is very heavy breathing and an occasional reverberating burp.

You will enjoy making this panel for display in your home, interrupting your work only to take an occasional snack of deviled eggs, etc. $48.49 0693

Tiffany Reproduction Tulip 16&quot; Globe (#2281) Lampshade Kit with Form The Deluxe Tulip Lampshade package contains glass from the palette of Youghiogheny Glass Company&apos;s High Strike and Stipple Glass series. Glass is provided in sheets, and coded to the pattern keys. Also included are the color coded pattern and the 16&quot; styrene lamp form upon which to build the shade.

 Tiffany Reproduction 16&quot; Globe Belted Dogwood (#2282) Lampshade Kit without Form This is one of the many versions of the Dogwood design which was a popular subject for Tiffany Studios. We show one version of this shade from page 82 of Dr. Egon Neustadt&apos;s book &quot;The Lamps of Tiffany&quot;. This design is called &quot;Belted Dogwood&quot; because of the floral belt which surrounds the shade. There are three rectilinear rows of glass below the flower belt, and six almost quadrangular rows above. As in many of the Tiffany Studios works, the designer of the shade has taken artistic license and shown the leaf and the floral bract in the design,although in nature the two features never appear at the same time.
The gridwork is probably the most difficult feature of this lampshade to construct. There are 32 vertical segments to the grid, and the design has three repeats. We have taken care of the problem of dividing 32 by 3 in a way which preserves the design. The glass for this project is furnished in uncut sheets. The flowers or bracts are pink. The small centers are yellow. The leaves are green, and the background is a tan or neutral honey color.

The lamp base shown in the illustration is not now available. We have used the #2211 Bowery Lamp Base, which is shown in section M of our catalog. $72.31 2303

This morning trio, all aquack in their eagerness, head toward the pond in the background. There they will banish all vestiges of sleep from eyes, ears, noses and other organs, by plunging into the bracing waters.

After these cleansing ablutions they will undoubtedly plow into the yucky bottom muck to dig out delectable slime for a hearty breakfast, lunch and snacks as needed. All the while their droppings will enrich the quality of life for the lower members of the food chain, including you and me, who might be inclined upon occasion to take a refreshing dip in a similar pond.

We hope that you will meditate upon these things as you contemplate this peaceful scene.

Ducks in a Row is a good choice as a window panel for a game room, or for one of your many mountain hunting lodges. $47.20 0841

We receive shipments of bevel clusters from time to time through the auspices of our roving emissary, Bernie (of the wide suspenders and high top shoes). The Nameless Glass Company in the Lesser Antipodes makes these bevels in the off-shift periods, just to use up the glass and to keep the machinery busy. The name of this glass company shall remain nameless.

These bevel clusters are bulk packed, which saves money both in packaging and shipping. We will send them to you packed separately in sets. The prices are very reasonable, and we have a fairly good supply although it is dwindling rapidly. If you will need clusters soon, now is the time to order. Opalescent Glass Opalescent glass from Spectrum, Wissmach and Youghiogheny. Includes stipple and mottled. Glass Packages for Bradley Sconces&amp;Torches Glass Packages for Bradley Bases Each of the Bradley Base patterns is accompanied by a bill of materials which shows how many square feet of each color of glass is needed to complete the stained glass lamp base. In each case, the list totals between 8-1/2 and 9 square feet. We calculate that less than 2-1/2 square feet of glass actually becomes part of the project, so that the extra will become part of your inventory, unless you waste a lot of it or drop it on the floor. We have used the higher figure in our calculations too, and will send about 16 pounds of glass in each package you order from us. Much of the glass is premium colors, as is usual with floral designs. In addition to the opalescent glass packages, we have devised an alternate scheme whereby we will furnish exotic glass chosen by our in-house colorist from our inventory of exotica from Youghiogheny Glass Company.

To add further to the confusion, if you request it we will choose alternate color schemes for you for the Belted Rose package. The original has yellow roses with a white background, but we will also select a glass package in pink, or in red if it will go better with the decor in which you intend to install your creation. The other shades do not lend themselves as well to such shennanigans, so we will let them be as intended.

Note: glass is furnished in sheets, not cut to size. One piece of each color glass in every package is marked with the number corresponding to the color code on the pattern sheet.

 As an assist in making these projects easier, we have put together glass packages of uncut sheets of glass in suitable colors for each shade, based on the manufacturers&apos; original description. Each glass package contains an over-supply of each glass to allow for grain selection and shading. This, when the shade is completed, you should have glass left over for other small projects. If you have special color preferences you may wish to buy just the pattern (or patterns) and the form. We will understand. 
 Spectrum Cathedral - Waterglass Beautiful cathedral glass from Spectrum, with a texture resembling ripples in water. Grape Trellis
Tiffany Reproduction Lampshade Package This beautiful project was featured in our catalogs from 1973 through 1978, but we had to withdraw it from sale because of the lack of a reliable supply of the glass required to build it. We now have ample glass of the right kind to enable you to embark upon and complete this impressive undertaking and create a creditable look-alike to the original, a Tiffany Studios production. We developed this project by studying the Tiffany Studios Grape Trellis Shade shown in eight-color process photography on page #254 of the book &quot;The Lamps of Tiffany&quot; by Dr. Egon Neustadt. The lampshade that was built from this set of drawings and instructions in 1973 is displayed in our building at the present time. It is 26 inches in diameter, and consists of more than 900 pieces of glass and took a craftsman more than 140 hours to build.
SPECIAL EFFECTS 
We achieved the authentic coloration by &quot;plating&quot; the glass, which means using two or more layers of glass to achieve the correct shade. The gradual lightening of the evening sky from the bottom of the shade to the top is done by using a pink opalescent over varying shades of purple or blue. The same method is used to depict varying ripeness in the grapes, and the ages of the leaves. In places where the vine or leaves cross over the trellis, the glass is raised to give a third dimension, which adds considerably to the authenticity of the depiction. 
CONTENTS OF THE PACKAGE 
The patterns occupy several sheets of pattern paper, because all of the eight panels are different. Detailed instructions are given for constructing a cardboard form from materials not included in the package. The Reproduction Package does contain all of the materials which will actually make up the shade. These materials consist of uncut sheets of various glasses in quantities sufficient (including a generous allowance for waste) for an experienced craftsperson to cut all of the pieces required for the shade.

Our package also includes a deluxe hardware package for hanging and wiring the lamp. In addition, we furnish the copper foil and black patina required.

Inland Cement System No stained or leaded glass work is really complete without cementing. It fills in all the spaces between the glass and the lead cames, and make the panel strong and waterproof.

For those of you who don&apos;t want the hassle of mixing your own cement, this Inland Cement System saves you the time and the mess. You&apos;ll just need to stir it up, because it will separate. It starts out a bit runny, so you might want to have some whiting handy to thicken it, much like you&apos;d thicken runny cake batter, only instead of being creamy and sweet, this stuff is most definitely not edible.

It&apos;s got a relatively short shelf life (a few months), so don&apos;t expect it to last as long as your own mix (which can be easily reconsitituted with turpentine if it begins to dry up). But it works well, and might be exactly the product for you. We&apos;ve tested it in our Basic Lead Class, and it got rave reviews.

Inland Cement System has a suspension agent that allows the cured cement to breath with changes in the weather, so the window remains solid and stable.

Price is per pound. ____________ ____________ ____________ ____________ Lower glass prices! On November 26, 2007, we lowered many of our glass prices. In fact, the list of glass items whose prices have been reduced is considerably lengthy -- about 225 of the 350 or so varieties of glass we carry. We would like to direct your attention to just a few:

- Our Drawn Antiques are now just $6.16 per pound, nearly 30% less than the old price of $8.65.

- Most of our Spectrum and Wissmach Opalescents have been reduced, from 10% to as much as 36% off the old price.

Please enjoy these new prices responsibly. Magnets with Pressure
Sensitive Adhesive backing The perfect solution to the problem of what to do when you want to hang a small sun catcher or other small stained glass piece onto the refrigerator. Rather than drive a nail into the refrigerator and having all the cold air come out, why not stick the sun catcher up there with a magnet. Why not indeed!? This magnetic material consists of a powdered steel substance combined with something else which allows it to be flexible, and also allows you to cut it with a scissors. Thus, you can use as much or as little as you wish, and stick it to the backside of the piece you want to hang up. Width is 1/2&quot;. Sold by the foot or in larger rolls.

When you study the expression on this goose&apos;s languid face, you may wonder what caused her satisfied smile.

You may remember the line from the song from the 1940&apos;s (although we can&apos;t imagine why) which ran &quot;She Smiled as She Whispered Mañana.&quot;

As you may suppose, a dream in which a Certain Gander is an important actor has engendered this soporific state. One can only imagine the particulars which left her in this pleasant reverie.

This is one of those projects which you should undertake for the sheer enjoyment of completing it and installing it in a prominent window where visitors will see it and carry the impression with them as they depart.

We do not offer even so much as a limited guarantee of this phenomena: we merely hint at the possibility that it might occur.

SCRAP GLASS PUT TO A USEFUL PURPOSE
After the original outlay for equipment and supplies, you can continue for years using the same equipment to make beautiful, useful items from small pieces of scrap glass left over from your traditional stained glass projects--glass that otherwise might be wasted or discarded

I then plug in my iron and wait for it to heat up. I test it from time to time until it is hot enough to melt a piece of solder being held against the tip. When this temperature has been reached, I unwind about 6 inches of solder from the roll and, holding the iron in one hand and the solder in the other, touch them together about 1/4&quot; above the first joint I wish to solder. I allow a bit of solder to melt onto the tip, and then transfer the melted solder onto the joint rapidly, and just as rapidly, remove the iron from the joint. The tip of the iron should stay on the surface of the lead just long enough to heat the lead and transfer the solder to it. At 800-1000 degrees, it doesn&apos;t take long to heat a piece of small lead came, so don&apos;t dally. After a few sessions you will notice that a rhythm develops, and soldering will become easy.



I Unplug the iron. and remove the nails holding the project in position. I then wipe off the excess flux with a piece of paper towel, turn the project over and apply flux onto the unsoldered side. (There is no need to hold the project in place with nails.) I proceed as before, and solder the second side.

Chanty (short for Chanticleer) is Cock of the Roost in Hanover, Massachusetts.

Chanty spent all of his adult summers to date entertaining the Boston chickens who come down to the South Shore for a relaxing vacation.

Chanty is obviously meditating upon this portion of his youth. He probably wonders what his life would have been like if he had chosen some other field of endeavor. All of us may have had this feeling at one time or another.

Here he is clearing his throat to announce his reluctant retirement from The Service. He has had some thoughts of becoming a stand-in for the rooster who used to announce the Pathe&apos; Newsreels in the movie theaters of yore. His agent is looking into this possibility. $69.98 0842

Take advantage of this rare opportunity to make these three heirloom lamp shades which are certain to increase in value as the years go by. We studied the photographs in Dr. Egon Neustsadt&apos;s book The Lamps of Tiffany, using a magnifying projector to assure that the patterns are accurate in every detail. These lamp shades are among the all-time favorites of Tiffany collectors.

You can order the three package collection at a generous saving over the regular prices if ordered separately. The standard glass packages are uncut sheets of glass, identified with the code shown on the pattern.

 Deluxe reproduction packages. For our customers who consider that their time is of vastly greater value than the cost of the standard reproduction package, we offer the deluxe package, which is made up of the Youghiogheny Tiffany Reproduction glass palette. They realize that the time required to painstakingly create these masterpieces calls for the most accurate glass selections available.

 The lamp shade form. All three of these lamp shades can be built upon the 16&quot; diameter lamp shade form. This styrene form is very hard. It resists the heat from the soldering iron, and can be used again and again. You can make as many lamp shades as you care to on this form. The lamp form is furnished with completely illustrated step-by-step instructions for its use. You can also buy blank pattern sets so you can design your own lamp shades.
