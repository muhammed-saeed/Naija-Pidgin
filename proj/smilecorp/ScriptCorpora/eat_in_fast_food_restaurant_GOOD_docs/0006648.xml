 When a Defective Product is Recalled and the Consumer Receives Notice of the Same or Doesn&apos;t Do Anything About it, Who is at Fault? 
 | Share 
Thanks to the efforts of committed product liability trial lawyers and increased government regulation, manufacturers and retailers are becoming more tuned in to the existence of defective products which may cause catastrophic injuries and, unfortunately, wrongful death.

Almost daily, a number of recalls are published, and some critics claim that consumers are experiencing “recall fatigue”. Over the past year, there has been a spike in food product recalls. In the last quarter of 2011, there were 176 food product recalls by over 150 companies. Last year, there were over 2,365 defective products recalled from pharmaceutical products to infant toys and chairs.

As an experienced Pennsylvania product liability attorney who has handled cases of death and serious injury for over three decades, I do not believe there is ever such a thing as “recall fatigue” as consumers must always have a right to know if there is a problem or defect regarding a particular product. Thank God, we live in an age of increased technology where it is easy to disseminate a message of a consumer recall for a potentially dangerous product. The federal government is also more involved with recalls of consumer products and operates a website http://recalls.gov as a single unified website. The USDA also offers consumers a twitter feed that will make recalls instantaneous. With the increased use of social media, including, but not limited to, Facebook, consumers and social networkers now increasingly take it upon themselves to provide a constant flood of dangerous product and recall information.

Historically, manufacturers seem to emphasize profitability rather than consumer safety and with increased monitoring by the government, as well as product liability lawyers, manufacturers can be held responsible if they fail to enhance the safety of their products in the field and may be subject to fines or lawsuits and even the ultimate blow to profitability, punitive damages.

Every year in America, unsafe products will cause approximately 30,000 deaths and even more injuries. Even after a recall when the manufacturer discovers the danger of the product, there may be additional legal liability. If a manufacturer intentionally conceals information and does a poor job of providing notice of a dangerous product in Pennsylvania or anywhere else in the United States, they may be subjected to additional damages, including punitive damages.

Each product liability case is unique and requires a careful evaluation to determine what entities may bear legal responsibility for the accident, injury, or death and in the case of a recall, all those in the product distribution chain may be held accountable including but not limited to distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. It is important if you were involved in an accident caused by a defective product or one that has been recalled to contact an experienced product liability lawyer who possesses the expertise to investigate and trace the chain of design, supply, and distribution.

The experienced Pennsylvania product liability lawyers of Reiff&amp;Bily understand that profitability should never trump consumer safety and always offer a free, no obligation consultation to those injured or killed due to the use of a defective or recalled product.

 A Beer Keg, Like Any Other Storage Container, Can Be a Deadly Weapon if Not Handled Properly 
 | Share 
Our thoughts and prayers go out to a brewery worker who died when a beer keg exploded at the Red Hook Brewery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on April 24, 2012. According to news sources, this tragic accident occurred when the worker had been filling kegs with air as part of the cleaning process to remove residual beer from the kegs when one exploded. Another worker sustained chest and head injuries.

As an experienced explosion accident lawyer for over three decades, I am aware that due to design defects, manufacturing defects, or improper handling, a relatively innocent looking beer keg or other tank can become an instrument of death.

Not so long ago, a 20 gallon beer keg overheated and exploded, killing the host of a fraternity party. Investigators determined that the keg which had been kept outside prior to the party had heated up in the sun causing the pressure to build inside the keg. When the host attempted to use the keg, it exploded projecting metallic shrapnel into nearby victims.

Over the years, I have worked with experts to investigate propane tank explosions, oxygen tank explosions, and gas tank explosions, which have all resulted in catastrophic injuries and in the worst cases, wrongful death. Most of these accidents have occurred from a combination of circumstances including damaged parts, corrosion, rust, incorrect inspection, improper storage, defective design, or deficient maintenance.

As a fan of the old beach party movies and other teen flicks, my memory goes back to beer parties on the beach where people were tossing things into the bonfire. Another beer keg explosion case involved the tossing of the keg into a bonfire, causing a deadly explosion that sent shards of metal into the crowd.

Unfortunately, not everyone has common sense and when you go to rent or use a keg of beer, the last thing you will probably ever think about is the keg exploding and injuring, or worse, killing, someone. Just as important as the contents inside the beer keg, or any tank for that matter, is the safety of users. Proper care, storage, and maintenance are necessary to protect those who come in contact with the beer keg or tank from any injury. Make sure that any tank or beer keg is stored in a clean, dry environment, and always check for corrosion and rust as well as connections to pressure sources. If transporting a beer keg or tank, make sure it is properly secured and always store them in an upright position where the pressure relief valves or safety valves are located. Never store tanks near a water heater, furnace, or potential source of ignition.

If you or a loved one has sustained an injury due to defective beer keg or other type of storage tank, you should have an unbiased independent investigation commenced immediately and make sure you do not dispose of or destroy any of the evidence.

 Don&apos;t Believe All the Claims that Retailers and Manufacturers of Sports Supplements Make 
 | Share 
 Many Sports Supplements are “Downright Dangerous” to Your Safety 

As an experienced Pennsylvania product liability lawyer who also happens to be a “health nut,” I frequently venture into vitamin shops across the country. I am always amazed to learn of many of the advertising claims made in the shops and on TV by the manufacturers of some new “wonder” product. Unfortunately, as a dangerous product attorney, I am all too familiar with claims of injuries and wrongful death that have occurred as a result of taking compounds that were successfully marketed, yet were found to be illegal and dangerous. Many times, the manufacturers of these supplements, and the retail outlets that they are sold in, make false and unsubstantiated representations concerning the safety and efficacy of these sports and health enhancement products. In fact, many of these products, when mixed with over-the-counter and prescription medications, can lead to toxic consequences.

Many of the enhancement products may contain dangerous additives including, but not limited to, suspected carcinogens. Many of our experts claim that they have diagnosed heart problems, kidney and liver issues, anxiety, depression, and addiction as well as death caused by tainted products sold openly as sports enhancers, performance enhancers, or dietary supplements in vitamin and health shops across the nation as well as on the internet.

Last year, Americans spent close to $30 billion dollars on supplements, multivitamins, and enhancers, marking a $5 billion increase of over the past five years. Although a majority of the supplements may be safe, as an experienced product liability attorney, I have repeatedly called for increased regulation to tackle the problems of safety.

If you or a loved one has been injured by a dangerous product, the experienced PA personal injury law firm of Reiff and Bily has successfully represented tens of thousands of claimants for over three decades. We always offer a free, no obligation consultation toll free at 1-800-421-9595 or online at www.reiffandbily.com.

 Who Is Responsible When A Car Crashes Through The Window Of A Restaurant Or Other Business Establishment Killing Individuals And Seriously Injuring Others 
 | Share 
This past weekend, I was asked to comment on a case where a car slammed into a restaurant, broke through the walls, and injured a number of customers killing another innocent and unknowing victim who was dining. The initial investigation of the incident revealed that the elderly driver of the car meant to hit the brakes but instead pressed the gas pedal crashing into the building.

Just last year, I was consulted on a similar case where an elderly gentleman also erroneously hit the accelerator pedal rather than the brake and crashed through the walls of fast food restaurant catastrophically injuring innocent patrons. This unfortunate scenario is more common than one can imagine.

A skilled catastrophic injury and wrongful death lawyer experienced in the arena of restaurant crash accidents, premise liability , car accident law , and automotive product liability should immediately begin a comprehensive investigation of the facts and work closely with authorities and independent investigators to determine the causation of the accident. Often many complex theories of law become intertwined in the investigation and litigation of car crash into restaurant cases.

The experienced Pennsylvania product liability , premise liability , and car accident lawyers of Reiff and Bily works with experienced and independent structural engineers, architects, building, safety, OSHA, and cognitive behavioral assessment experts to carefully analyze the facts of each individual case. We request that our experts credibly opine about the inadequacy of curb and building structures, as well as immediately look for product defects on the striking vehicle including but not limited to; defective braking system , failure of steering system , or faulty acceleration .

There are many ways that a vehicle crash into a restaurant can occur. Perhaps the driver was intoxicated or under the influence of mind altering drugs or prescriptions. Perhaps the driver was speeding, or perhaps there was a defect with the vehicle that prevented the driver from stopping or having his vehicle under control.

At any rate, one thing is for certain, when innocent bystanders are harmed due to a car accident or premise liability claim such as this, they are entitled to have a full independent investigation completed by an experienced car accident and premise liability attorney who understands how in just a matter of seconds a victim and their family’s lives can be changed. The victim and their family have a right to expect that they will be entitled to recover monetary damages for the harm caused to them by the wrongdoers.

The experienced Pennsylvania car accident , premise liability , and product liability lawyers of Reiff and Bily have over 30 years of experience representing the interests of catastrophically injured victims and their families, offering a free no obligation consultation and a zero recovery, no fee guarantee.

 Snow Blowers May Be Dangerous To Your Arms, Hands, Health, Safety, and Life Advises Pennsylvania Product Defect Lawyer 
 | Share 
When I was a young teenager, I watched one of my neighbors sustain the amputation of multiple fingers on his hand as he attempted to clear the discharge chute of a snow blower. The memory of this event has been forever instilled in my mind. Moving forward 40 years, with 30 of them spent as a Pennsylvania defective product and product liability attorney who has handled numerous lawn mower and snow blower injury cases, I am well aware of the fact that the number of snow blower injuries and amputations continues to soar.

On many snow blower models exit chutes tend to become clogged when their operators attempt to snow blow snow that is to wet or heavy for a snow blower to clear. Snow blower exit chutes can also become clogged as a result of a snow blower operator pushing the snow blower too quickly. All too often snow blower operators will attempt to clear the passage of the exit chute with their hands not giving thought that the machine’s dangerous blade mechanism is still operating within the chute. The blades inside a snowblower rotate at an extremely high rate of speed and are extremely sharp, easily able to cut through bone, tendons, muscles, and skin. According to statistics released by the CPSC (consumer product safety commission) 6,000 to 7,000 people are injured each year in snow blower accidents with a good percentage of those injuries involving amputation.

A single stage snow thrower uses an auger blade at the front of the unit to eject the snow. Two stage snow throwers use an auxiliary high speed impeller in the discharge chute to throw the snow. Standards and safety specifications for snow throwers indicate that a means shall be provided that will automatically stop the impeller in five seconds when the operator leaves the operator position. However, the standards do not speak to the method or methods that they use to insure that the impeller stops in five seconds. Many times, there are failures of the stopping mechanism which is actually an intolerable product defect since the operator has reason to conclude that the blades have been stopped. Many clutch mechanisms are designed to put a cessation to the impeller which would mitigate the chance for amputation or they are often improperly designed or defectively manufactured resulting in faults which can cause harm to innocent and unknowing victims.

If you have been injured or suffered an amputation in a snow blower accident , it is important to immediately secure the allegedly defective snow blower so that it can be properly investigated by a defective snow blower expert and engineer to establish:

 1. That it is not defectively designed;

2. Prove that there were safer alternative designs; or

3. That the manufacturer failed to provide effective warnings and instructions on how to safely remove clogged snow from the chute. 

The Pennsylvania product liability law firm of Reiff and Bily always offers a free, no obligation consultation to consumers injured by defectively designed or manufactured products . We believe that safety is priority number one. Contact us toll free at 1-800-421-9595 or online at www.reiffandbily.com .

 Philadelphia Bicycle and Car Accident Lawyer Salutes Pennsylvania Legislature Plan Designed To Protect Bicyclists – I Hope It Is Enforced! 
 | Share 
As an avid bicyclist and Philadelphia bicycle accident lawyer who has represented bicycle accident victims seriously injured in bicycle traffic accidents for more then 30 years, I salute the Pennsylvania Senate’s approval of a Bill known as the “Safe Passing Law&quot;. The “Safe Passing Law&quot; requires cars to leave a 4 foot clearance when passing a bicyclist and it applies in Pennsylvania cities, suburbs, and rural areas.

In Philadelphia and surrounding counties, even despite placement of bicycle traffic lanes adjacent to traffic, many avid cyclists know that they have had a close call by someone who was ignorant of the cyclist or has buzzed by them in an alarming way almost causing, or in fact actually causing, a catastrophic injury . Personally, I was almost struck by a SEPTA bus while riding my bicycle in a bicycle lane, causing me to flip over the handle bars and break my wrist. I have represented bicyclists who have suffered broken bones, brain injuries , amputations , and in the worse cases a wrongful death when they were struck by a motorist ignorant of their rights on the road. Hopefully the new “Safe Passing Law&quot; with proper enforcement by law enforcement officials will serve to educate other motorists on how to properly and safely pass a bicyclist. It will be interesting to observe how the new bicycle passing law is enforced, and whether the penalties have enough teeth to deter wrongdoers. Only time will tell.

The Pennsylvania bicycle accident law firm of Reiff and Bily remains committed to bicyclist safety and always offers a free, no obligation consultation to those injured in bicycle accidents caused by the fault of another or due to a defectively designed bicycle , a defectively manufactured bicycle , or a defectively designed bicycle component part .

 Size May Matter If You Are Engaged In Sports But It Should Never Matter When It Comes To Safety Of Automobile Occupants Advises Experienced Auto Defect Lawyer 
 | Share 
As an experienced automobile defect and car accident attorney for over three decades, I recognize one thing, cars should be designed safely for everyone whether they are adults or children. Unfortunately, when it comes to safety many of the large automobile manufacturers have sacrificed the interests of both children and those individuals that are above or below average sized individuals.

Each year, thousands of children are seriously injured and killed due to poor seat belt fit or improper restraint systems in the vehicle.

Many times child and infant car seats are improperly designed or have manufacturing defects presenting hidden dangers. Children between the ages of 4 and 8 under 80 lbs. are typically less than 48 inches tall and are exposed to a higher risk of catastrophic injury or
