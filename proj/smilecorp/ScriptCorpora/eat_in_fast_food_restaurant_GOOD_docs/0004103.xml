 Has anyone ever had their kid’s birthday party at a fast food restaurant with an indoor play area? 
   Dining Out   Add comments Aug 22 2010   
I’m considering this for my son’s fifth birthday (probably either at Burger King or Chick-Fil-A) because I just don’t think we have enough space in our house for a bunch of preschoolers. I’m just wondering if anyone else has done this, and if so, how it went.
I would rather have his party at a park too, but it’s at the end of October and you just never know what the weather will be like here in Ohio. It could be beautiful, or it could snow!

We have attended several. I would prefer to hold a party for my son at a park. The indoor play areas are germ factories. Take your child there and stop for cold medicine on the way home. As a further bonus, if you are allowed to eat in the actual play area, you’ll enjoy the fresh smell of urine to complement the ambiance.

My little sisters party was at a Burger King. It went pretty well they give you a cake, sodas, the decorate an area of the restaurant and you get like 2 or 3 hours in the indoor play area. You might want to check out Chuk. E Cheeses as well. There you get tokens pizza soda and cake plus they have a mechanical band for some kids though it can be scary.

On the one hand, I consider indoor play scapes at Burger Kings, etc. to be unsanitary. The management will tell you they are clean—in reality they are filthy. Go into one–crawl up in the playscape–look carefully. I have found dirt, diapers, feces, vomit, etc. It is the one topic that many moms and I have discussed over the years.

On the other hand, my children loved those playscapes until they were old enough to understand that 2-3 days after visiting one of those places, they would become ill with vomiting, fever, etc. The sickness would always followed. So, we stopped going. My children enjoy their birthdays just with family–it does not have to be an elaborate event.

For the love of common sense, NO.
But, if you like the idea of your kids contracting AIDS or some other plague by stepping in fecal material in the colour-ball pit, the by all means go ahead.

We have had our children’s parties at the indoor McDonalds playground for the past 5 years. You just go in and set it up your self and no rental cost. They do have a bday package that costs about 20-30 dollars depending on how many kids, but we just do the cake and decor ourselves. It has always gone over well.
