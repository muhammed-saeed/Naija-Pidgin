 Fund for jobless pay running out of money 

August 11th, 2008, 5:00 am· ·posted by Jan Norman, small-business columnist 
 
California’s fund that pays unemployment benefits will go bankrupt by the end of 2009 if the sluggish economy and higher benefits without reform continue, according to the state Employment Development Department .

A likely solution could end up costing employers their tax credit for payments into the state Unemployment Insurance (UI) Fund.

The EDD’s annual Unemployment Insurance Fund Forecast ( Acrobat Reader required) projects that the UI Fund balance that was $2.4 billion at the end of 2007 will be cut in half to $1.1 billion by the end of 2008.

The fund will barely escape bankruptcy in the first quarter, but will exceed total tax receipts by $2.7 billion by the end of 2009. Here’s the EDD’s chart:

 
“These estimated balances could change depending upon actual employment levels and claims filed,”the EDD forecast said.

Those numbers depend on the accuracy of EDD’s projection of the number of unemployed California workers receiving payments from the UI fund. Here are EDD’s numbers of people drawing unemployment:

 2006: 873,000 2007: 968,000 2008: 1,108,000 2009: 1,122,000 

A little worsening of the state’s economy could easily increase the 2008 and 2009 numbers. An economic boom would decrease them.

The UI fund went bankrupt in 2004, says the California Chamber of Commerce. The cause, then as now, is that the economy went south right after the legislature in 2001 approved a 95% increase in benefits without making any reforms in the program.

That benefit increase, implemented over three years, cut the UI fund’s surplus from $6 billion to $397,000.

The state only avoided wiping out the fund entirely by taking an emergency loan — for the first time in history — of $1.4 billion from the federal government plus increasing employers’tax to the highest allowable by law: an“F”level plus 15%.

Those federal loans cannot be repaid from the UI Fund. They must be repaid from the state’s general fund, but this time repayment is problematic because the state is $15 billion in the red already.

If the state in 2009 borrows from the federal government to cover unemployment checks, it could impact employers’tax credit for payments to the UI Fund, EDD said. After two years, the tax per employee would increase 37.5% and after four years, the tax would be $119 per employee compared to a $56 maximum now.

Maybe giving benefits to illegal aliens was a bad idea as the taxpayers have screamed in the government’s ears for two decades.

If they stopped paying benefits to illegal immigrants this state and country would be extremely wealthy. CLOSE THE BORDERS and stop the handouts.

I’ve read the report and this article. It looks like our legislature put a bandage on this problem by not reforming unemployment laws after the bankruptcy of the fund in 2004 when they should have done some major surgery. Increasing benefits and borrowing to keep the fund afloat are not only lousy fiscal management but appear to me to be a violation of the lawmaker’s fiduciary responsibility to the voters. EDD and legislators here is a recommendation–DO THE MATH! You broke it now fix it. As for my fellow employers, we are all going to have to suck it up if we want to continue to do business in California.

You guys are idiots. You people who think illegal aliens are draining social services need to do your research. That is one small part of the whole situation. It is due to the fact that health premiums go up and up and companies are being made to pay the difference, forcing numerous cutbacks (ie: letting people go). What you think farm workers and fast food restaurant employees are draining these services? Get a clue.

In addition, you have a declining dollar, increased gas prices, and food prices. Who do you think will pick our crops when you begin checking visas for some 300,000 farmers across the state? Then you will be complaining more when a head of lettuce is five dollars a batch. Use your brain please. Perhaps you should pick up a book instead of watching Bill O’Reilly or Lou Dobbs. Read…

California has the 7-8th largest economy in the world, largely due to the cheap labor provided by immigrants. Now you want to place all the blame on these people for performing jobs many Americans are unwilling to do? That makes no sense.

We should start looking at the small number of corporations experiencing record profit margins at the expense of millions of Californians. The health care system is broken, not just for illegals but for many Americans as well. We have a bunch of legislators [ on both sides of the aisle ] endorsing policies that do not make sense but agrees w/their financial supporters. This is a huge problem for not just in California but the U.S. as well.
