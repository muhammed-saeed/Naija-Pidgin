The burgers were awesome and cheap.
There&apos;s 4 steps.
1.  Pick your meat 1/3lb burger is $3.79 (there&apos;s chicken and veggie too)
2.  Pick your cheese ( i think there was 12 kinds or so )
3.  Pick your condiments from about 20 or so
4.  Pick your extras like sauteed onions, mushrooms, ect...

It&apos;s burgers and fry&apos;s.  It&apos;s fast, cheap and good.

Food was okay. I would compare this place to a chilli&apos;s with a fastfood atmosphere. I would go back to this place in the future. This particular location has a 10% military discount.

When they first opened the food was good and the burger pattys were freshly made. Now they use some flux meat patty that is pre-formed t look irregularly shaped. It is really kind of freaky. At any rate not he best burger in town and for the money the chain fast food stores have them beat.
