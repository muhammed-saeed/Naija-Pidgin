 America Runs on ... Sausage, Egg and Cheese Croissant 

Dunkin Donuts on Route 22 offers smart breakfast options, as well as several not-so-smart options
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Wednesday, July 20, 2011 
 
Springfield has its share of breakfast options, from West 22 to Bagel Chateau, from Bagels Supreme to Dunkin&apos; Donuts. Some are quicker and more convenient than others. A few months ago, when we had some time to kill before work after dropping a friend at the airport, we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast at West 22 Diner. This week, we return to the most important meal of the day, but with a meal better suited to those of us who don&apos;t have an hour to kill before work – a sausage egg and cheese croissant from Dunkin Donuts on Route 22. But before we get to breakfast, let&apos;s take a look at the lunch options. Last year, we checked out the flatbread sandwiches at the Dunkin Donuts on Mountain Avenue. Several varieties are offered, from the palatable…

 Japanese Fish, Korean Beef at Hinari Sushi 

With a large&quot;Grand Opening,&quot;sign, this tiny Morris Avenue restaurant fills its tables at lunchtime
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Tuesday, May 17, 2011 
 
Amid the countless “For Rent” signs on Morris Avenue is a sign that bucks the trend:&quot;Grand Opening.&quot;This isn&apos;t the launch of a new, risky venture. Rather, it&apos;s a sign of new ownership for Hinari Sushi, which has served Japanese food in this location for more than four years. Little has changed, however, inside Hinari Sushi. In fact, with the exception of a two flat-screen television in the front of the restaurant, it appears little has changed in years. Walls are wood-paneled on the bottom, off-white on top, with tiny fish stenciled along the walls. A whiteboard in the front lists the day&apos;s specials, and in the back of the shop are some framed photographs of sushi and sashimi. The new televisions show a slideshow of menu items while …

 Baked Ziti at Antonio Mozzarella Factory 

Choices abound at this Italian deli, and if you eat in-house, you might just forget that it&apos;s winter
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Tuesday, January 18, 2011 
 
The sunroom at Antonio Mozzarella Factory is perhaps one of the best places to enjoy a meal on a subfreezing winter afternoon. Snow may cover the ground outside, but sunlight pours into this room from three sides, bringing light, warmth and a reminder of the seasons to come. Several weeks ago, when I listed five of my favorite meals in downtown Springfield, a reader reminded me of Antonio Mozzarella Factory. While a stone&apos;s throw from the downtown, I omitted it from the list because of its awkward location on Springfield Avenue, near the Union and Millburn borders. The reader stated that the long menu can often be a problem, as it offers so many options. “One of the best lunches in town is definitely Antonio Mozzarella Factory,” the reader…

 Top Five Lunches of 2010 

A look back at our favorite sit-down bargain, burger, sandwich, bagel and salad.
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Tuesday, January 4, 2011 
 
This month marks one year since we started eating our way through the township&apos;s lunch options. Before we jump into another year of reviews, let&apos;s take a look back at the best lunches of 2010. Best sit-down bargain, Hunan Spring—All 27 lunch specials at this longtime Morris Avenue Chinese range from 6.95 to $7.95. Each special comes with a side of steamed white rice, steamed brown rice or roast pork fried rice; a starter of wonton, hot and sour, egg drop, chicken noodle or chicken rice soup; a pot of fragrant jasmine tea; and, of course, a fortune cookie. On a cold winter day, the spicy garlic chicken will warm you up. Served with tiny celery shoots, red bell peppers and water chestnuts, the entree included a generous amount of white meat …

 Fresh Fettuccini with White Wine, Tomatoes and Gorgonzola from Echoqua 

Spoil yourself with a sit-down Italian lunch in the Echo Plaza
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Thursday, November 4, 2010 
 
Though conveniently located at the intersection of Mountain Avenue and Route 22, Echoqua&apos;s tiny storefront is almost hidden, lost among Outback, Chen&apos;s 22 and the new Stew Leonard&apos;s liquor store. Once you find it, however, you&apos;ll be greeted with paintings of Venetian canals and Mediterranean villas and the voices of Frank Sinatra, Jerry Vale or Michael Buble coming through the speakers and a menu with a long list of lunch specials. For the health- and weight conscious, carbohydrate dishes aren&apos;t the most popular these days. Pasta makers could not have been happy with the diets that have come out of the last decade. But I embraced carbs. I am training for the New York City Marathon. I had to complete a 20-mile run, my longest run ever, and …

 Simple, Authentic Tacos from Picante 

Morris Avenue establishment offers a real taste of Mexico
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Wednesday, September 22, 2010 
 
From Tinga in Millburn to Tito&apos;s in Summit, from Taco Bell on Morris Avenue to Chipotle Mexican Grill on Route 22, we have our share of wannabe Mexican food joints. But hidden behind some multicolored curtains right in our own downtown, we also have the real thing—Picante Taste of Mexico. Diego Rivera prints and colorful pottery adorning the walls, Mexican music piped through the speakers and a menu void of chalupas, salmon burritos or BBQ tacos were good signs that Picante was authentic. Sure enough, as I chatted with the owner, I learned that he was a native of Acupulco. He has worked in American restaurants for years, but for the last three years, he is a resaturant owner. Having worked over commercial deep friers, he said he has no …

 Six Spots for Outdoor Lunches 

Eat outside and enjoy the temperate weather while you can
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Thursday, September 16, 2010 
 
With the hottest summer on record now behind us, it&apos;s time to enjoy the outdoors before we dust off our jackets. Unlike some of our neighbors (think Westfield and Millburn), Springfield doesn&apos;t have the widest or most beautiful selection of outdoor options, but we do have some. The following are six outdoor lunch spots in ascending order (i.e., starting with&quot;ehhh&quot;and working our way to my favorite spot): No. 6, Panera Bread. Sitting under an umbrella looking out on the Sports Authority parking lot isn&apos;t too appealing. And nor is the food here. But Health magazine recently named this Missouri-based chain America&apos;s healthiest fast-food restaurant. Some like the comfort of chain food. I&apos;m not a fan. Many of the healthy options have that …

 Rainbow Rolls from ShopRite 

Bright and bustling (but neither spacious nor modern), this grocery store offers several lunch options, at a price.
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Thursday, August 12, 2010 
 
The lunch hour is a convenient time for running errands, so if I can grab lunch while grocery shopping, two birds are killed with just one stop. The salad bars at Kings and Whole Foods, both just over the township&apos;s borders, have long been favorites of mine (Kings more so than Whole Foods). But Springfield&apos;s grocery stores never struck me as lunch spots: Food King I found depressing and ShopRite is less convenient for me, and it sits in the shadow of Kings. A week after being pleasantly surprised by the friendly deli counter at an otherwise dim, aged Food King, I drove up Morris Avenue to sample the food at ShopRite. As any passerby can see, the building itself is about as dated as the interior of Food King. Just outside the entrance, …

 NoonEats: Deli Sandwiches from Food King 

The store may be a downer, but don&apos;t underestimate the friendly deli counter
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Vincent Gragnani Wednesday, August 4, 2010 
 
I get depressed every time I go into Food King. Maybe I am spoiled by bright, spacious and modern grocery stores like King&apos;s in Short Hills and Whole Foods and Super Stop and Shop in Union. Perhaps it&apos;s the store&apos;s dim lighting or the feeling that little has changed in the store in decades. It&apos;s not an uplifting shopping experience. But the Morris Avenue location is convenient for me, and so on occasion I run in for a few groceries on my lunch hour. Last week, I tried the deli—and was pleasantly surprised. I didn&apos;t see sandwich selections or prices posted, so after a too-quick glance under the glass counter, I asked for ham and swiss. Given a choice of rye or roll, I went with the rye, with lettuce, tomato and mustard as well. Stocking all…

 Affordable, Adequate Italian Fare at Sofia’s 

Springfield’s newest culinary attraction offers middle-of-the-road cuisine and prices.
 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS Cindy Loh Monday, August 2, 2010 
 
Sofia&apos;s, the sister establishment of Marra&apos;s in Roseland, bills itself as serving fine Italian cuisine in a family-oriented atmosphere. A contradiction of sorts, the BYO restaurant is most successful in the latter. White tablecloths juxtaposed with prominently displayed flat screen TVs creates a strange ambiance in the large, catering hall-esque dining space, and service begins with an equally odd offering: a small dish of raw carrot coins in Italian dressing. It&apos;s hard to know where the meal will go from here. Starters include many of the usual suspects: fried calamari with sweet or hot sauce ($8.95), mozzarella and roasted peppers ($7.95), baked clams oreganato ($7.50), and pasta e fagioli soup ($6.95), as well as a nondescript Caesar …
