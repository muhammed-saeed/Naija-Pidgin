inscriptions.

Fast Food Event

Go into a fast food restaurant. Order one example of every item on the
menu. Line everything up in a row on the table. Starting at one end of the
row, begin eating the items one at a time. Eat each item before moving on

Eat as fast as possible without eating too fast. Eat neatly. Do not make a
mess.
