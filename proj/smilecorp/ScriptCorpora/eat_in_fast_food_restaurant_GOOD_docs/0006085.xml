I hate working fast food..
 Flag Uploaded by:  numfortytwo previous next random 
 Comment I understand that people pay for the food, but some problems are just so stupid. Friend I work with said this to me as he was raging about a customer today. Having a friend to work with makes it a million times better. But stupid customers make me mad

If you want quality, pay $5-$10 at a real restaurant...And if you think the people working there are retards, well, they probably are, but what do you expect? 5-star quality service?
 Hide Hide All +Fav (0) Reply +1 #586 to #582 - anonymous (02/27/2012) [-] I expect them to do their job, which is to take my order correctly and give me what I ordered. Just because I&apos;m paying less than I would at a&quot;real restaurant&quot;doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s acceptable for them to fuck up.

&quot;I got something that isn&apos;t what I ordered, but that&apos;s okay, it was only a dollar!!! What a bargain, I should just be grateful and eat what I didn&apos;t order, because it&apos;s cheap.&quot;

No, I don&apos;t think so.

 Hide Hide All +Fav (0) Reply 0 #596 to #590 - anonymous (02/27/2012) [-] I know, and I never complain unless it&apos;s a completely different order, like this time when the guy at the cashier gave me someone else&apos;s order and had me pay for that instead. I think it&apos;s not totally unfair of me to inform him of his mistake, and pay the correct amount of money, right? If they just neglected to take out something that I didn&apos;t want, that&apos;s fine, I&apos;ll pick it out myself without making a huge fuss.

The thing is, the guy that posted this is saying it&apos;s unreasonable for the customers to complain when they don&apos;t get what they want. And whether it&apos;s the kitchen guy&apos;s fault or the cashier guy&apos;s fault, someone is wrong, and there&apos;s this saying,&quot;The customer is always right&quot;, so it&apos;s not the customer. And again, if they have a reason to complain, someone did something wrong. And yes, it&apos;s unfair if it&apos;s the kitchen guy&apos;s fault and the cashier gets yelled at, but someone needs to be informed, and the customer is not going into the kitchen to tell the kitchen guy.

Tl;dr: The customer always has a right to complain if something is wrong with their order, no matter what establishment is serving the food. Unless it&apos;s a soup kitchen or something, but guess what, McDonald&apos;s isn&apos;t a charity.

 Hide Hide All +Fav (0) Reply +3 #561 - anonymous (02/27/2012) [-] I have no sympathy for you. Customers get mad when the employee doesnt do the job right, which is really sad because all you have to do is read a sign that tells you what to put on the burger. If you could learn how to correctly read a sign and execute what it says, all problems would vanish.
McDonalds employees, if you are reading this, I hate you. I really, truly hate you. You complain about a customer because you and your pea-brained co-workers cant perform one of the simplest tasks known to the food industry, so you are really just getting mad at yourself.
 Hide Hide All +Fav (0) Edit Image Reply +2 #581 to #561 - putbreze (02/27/2012) [-] Out of hundreds of orders a day, one person makes one simple mistake. If it&apos;s someoneone who makes the burger, the person at front counter shouldn&apos;t be getting yelled at. Besides, what kind of service do you excpect from 3 freaking dollars! Your order is not the only order, when 50 things are on screen that are pressured to be done, it&apos;s easy to make a mistake. So don&apos;t be a DICK just because you hate your own life and you have your own anger management problems.

YOU ARE A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. YOUR FUCKING JOB IS TO GIVE US THE FOOD HOW WE ORDER IT. WE WONT COMPLAIN IF YOU DO YOUR JOB, DIPSHIT.

 Sorry, fellow FJ&apos;ers. Comlaining McDonalds employees just really piss me off for some reason.

Worst of all, they didn&apos;t give me a receipt, which is generally in my bag, so they wouldn&apos;t give me them after I went inside to retrieve them.

 Show Hide All +Fav (0) Reply -11 #547 - anonymous (02/27/2012) [-] Learn to like the way mcdonalds burgers are normally cooked. They&apos;re always pre-made and it saves you so much time. Asking one for nothing on it takes like 10 times fucking longer.. and I don&apos;t even work at a fast food restaurant but I have a friend who always fucking asks for a a double cheese burger with no onions or sauce or anything just the burger, the cheese and the bun. Then I&apos;ll get my burger and finish it before he gets his because he&apos;s mister fucking picky pants. I mean Jesus fucking Christ. It&apos;s just a burger. If you complain about the quality of food your getting in McDonalds you need to go somewhere else to eat. I&apos;m sorry you weren&apos;t happy with you $1 burger, please, allow me to offer you this $1 shoelace instead. Make sure you don&apos;t eat it too fast. I mean holy fucking shit Be happy you&apos;re even able to get food at that price. Do you know who works at McDonalds? Teenagers and nowadays people who should have much better jobs because fuck the economy. The last thing they want is you, some spoiled fuck complaining about the food they just made. Again, they work in fast-food restaurants. Again, their job is not to make GOOD food, it is to make FAST food. Unless you are allergic to something then don&apos;t fucking complain. You have worse things to be worrying about than whether or not you consume a vegetable. I sued to insult Americans by saying&quot;The last vegetable you ate was probably on a McDonalds burger&quot;. Thanks for verifying that you fat lazy fucks won&apos;t even eat one there.

 Hide Hide All +Fav (0) Reply +1 #570 to #547 - anonymous (02/27/2012) [-] Just because McDonald&apos;s customers are paying a dollar for their burgers doesn&apos;t mean they have less of a right to expect a correct order. If the orders are meant to be so inflexible that taking out a few vegetables is going to take over 10 minutes, I&apos;m sure there would be a policy stating that orders cannot be altered, and customers shouldn&apos;t bother to ask for something other than what&apos;s shown exactly in the picture.

McDonald&apos;s isn&apos;t a fucking soup kitchen, we don&apos;t have to&quot;be grateful&quot;for what they serve because it&apos;s cheap or get used to what they serve the way it is. They still need to get the order right because at the end of the day, people are paying the full price for what they&apos;re serving, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s asking too much to change the order up a little.
