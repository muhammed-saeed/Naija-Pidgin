 Some Obama Allies Fear School Lunch Bill Could Rob Food Stamp Program

WASHINGTONIn her campaign to reduce childhood obesity and improve school nutrition, Michelle Obama has become entangled in a fight with White House allies, including liberal Democrats and advocates for the poor.
At issue is how to pay for additional spending on the school lunch program and other child nutrition projects eagerly sought by the White House. A bill that the House is expected to consider within days would come up with some of the money by cutting future food stamp benefits.
When the Senate passed the bill in early August, Mrs. Obama said she was thrilled. But anti-hunger groups were not. They deluged House members on Thursday with phone calls and e-mails expressing alarm.
It is wrong to take money from food stamps to finance child nutrition programs,said Edward M. Cooney, executive director of the Congressional Hunger Center, an advocacy group.You are taking money from low-income people in one program and spending it on low-income peoplemaybe the same peoplein another program.

Any sort of a school lunch program will do a much better job of guaranteeing kids get fed than drug-stamp programs.

There is nothing wrong with the school lunches now, unless they intend to station a trained chef in every school and cook gourmet cuisine

Funny how they don’t like it when these folks redistribute their money. Hypocrites.

food cards (stamps) currently run at .50 per dollar.

the best source to obtain them is from those in the community vans to the methadone clinics.

i $hit no one in the least.

better than hitting the food banks.

this is a sad fact.

You haven&apos;t bought into the notion that it&apos;s the government&apos;s job to guarantee that kids get fed, have you?

Where are all these kids that are supposed to be going hungry?

I don’t see thin kids anywhere except maybe playing lacrosse or soccer.

Go to the mall and they’re all chubby or worse, including the moms.

Have you eaten a school lunch lately? I’m not very picky, but I couldn’t eat it when I had lunch with my son at his school.

I live in Fairfax County, VA, one of the richest counties in America. One out of every four students in the 175,000 K-12 student population receives either free or subsidized school meals. It is not just the poor who are beneficiaries of these programs.

See my post #10. You should check with your school district to find out how many students are receiving free or subsidized meals at school. You will be amazed.

Is there any good reason that the kid&apos;s families can&apos;t guarantee that they are fed?
 12 posted on 09/23/2010 10:03:49 PM PDT by mountainbunny [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies ] To: fightinJAG I feed my child on about $1.00 to $1.50 per day. Fresh fruit, whole grain sandwich or low sodium healthy soup, chocolate milk with two cookies (treat). Lunches cost anywhere from $3.00 to $5.00 at the cafeteria for pizza, nuggets or hamburgers. Why don&apos;t the“poor”give up a six pack a week, get off their fat @sses and make their kids a healthy lunch? Can&apos;t they afford a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk a weeks worth of fruit in season with their food card? Guess some pigs ARE more equal than others.

Doesn’t Fairfax have a lot of illegals? Their kids would most likely be getting the free lunch program.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 10 | View Replies ] To: fightinJAG There are plenty of legal and illegal students in the Fairfax County school system. There are over 22,000 students in the ESOL program and 45,000 in the federal school meal program.
The fact is that the schools are manipulating the program for federal subsidies for meals to subsidize their food service operations and to lower the costs to paying students. It is a giant scam in many ways. I spoke to the County Supervisor of Prince William County who said that progably 50% of the students there receive these federal subsidies. The criteria are so broad that many qualify for assistance beyond the so-called poor.
 Here is a good study on the issue 
This country is going broke and it is no wonder when you see programs like this one. In this case, there is such a thing as a free lunch.
