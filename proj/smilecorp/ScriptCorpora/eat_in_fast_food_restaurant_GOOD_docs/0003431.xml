 Sonic Drive-In is a fast food restaurant chain in the United States. Every day it offers over 3 million customers, like you, the facility to drive in their automobiles in any of its more than 3,500 restaurants and enjoy dining. It was established in 1953 and is currently operational in forty-four states of America.

Www.TalkToSonic.com is the site through which its corporate office at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma aims to gather its customers’views about this unique dining experience. You, too, can share your recent dining experience and express your candid views to the company by participating in its‘Guest Satisfaction Survey’through this site. To participate in this survey, you need to enter the ID number located at the bottom of your receipt and complete the survey within 14 days of your recent dining. Your views are very valuable to the company and to show its gratitude, the company will award you a validation code at the end of the survey. You can redeem this code to get a free SONIC Burger on a purchase of medium tot or Single-Patty Burgers, during your future visit to any of its drive-ins.
