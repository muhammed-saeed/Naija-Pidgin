 [ edit ] Get around 
 Casco Bay Ferry in the Old Port. 
Portland, and Maine in general, does not have an extensive public transportation system, so renting a car is generally the best option. While 5 o&apos;clock traffic can get a little congested, driving in Portland is not a daunting task.

 Metro , 114 Valley St, +1 207 774-0351, [7] . Bus line has a regular schedule, and provides a high level of service for a city of its size. Metro is not the best option for late night socializing; there are numerous taxicab companies. Walking is probably the best option downtown and especially in the Old Port or by the waterfront.

The Old Port and Downtown Arts District areas are very walkable and pedestrian friendly. The pedestrian always has the right of way, with or without a cross walk. This is a state law and is very much enforced. The punishment for non compliance is a $500 fine and 6 month license suspension.

Maine has a tough OUI (operating under the influence) law which applies to not only cars but also boats, horses, and even lawn mowers. The legal limit is .08 (~5 drinks); the standard punishment is 60 days in jail, license suspension for one year, and a $2500 fine for the first offense. After a second offense, the driver license will be revoked permanently, not merely suspended, and the driver will be fed to a pack of satanic lobsters.

 [ edit ] Staying Safe 

In keeping with Maine&apos;s reputation as a relatively crime-free U.S. State, there is no place in Portland a visitor should feel like they shouldn&apos;t visit during the day. As in any city, be alert in areas that are not well lit at night or deserted. Act with common sense and you should have no trouble.

Maine state liquor laws require all bars to close promptly at 1 am. The Old Port&apos;s numerous bars empty into the street at this time. Some rowdiness is to be expected, but there is always an increased police presence on busy nights.
