 A List of Vitamins in Fast Foods 
 Nov 27, 2010 | By Natalie Stein Photo Credit Jupiterimages/Brand X Pictures/Getty Images 
If you are always busy at meal times and find that your only option is fast food, remember that some fast foods provide essential nutrients. Although fast foods may provide many B vitamins as well as vitamin C, they may also be high in calories and fat. Try to check the nutrition information for fast foods before you place your order so that you know whether it will fit into your diet.
 
Vitamin C

The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health states that vitamin C is an antioxidant that is also essential for wound healing and immune function. According to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, vitamin C is in many fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, strawberries, red and green peppers and broccoli. You can also get vitamin C from fast foods made with potatoes such as French fries or hash browns. A medium baked potato has about 20 mg vitamin C, or about 33 percent of the daily value. Even though the potato dish that you order from a fast food restaurant may provide vitamin C, remember that it may also be high in calories, fat and sodium if it is fried and seasoned. If you are at a fast food restaurant, a healthier source of vitamin C could be orange juice, with about 80 calories and 60 to 90 mg vitamin C per 6-oz. serving.
 
Niacin

Niacin, or vitamin B3, is in many different foods that you might order at a fast food restaurant. You need niacin to get energy from the fats, carbohydrates and proteins in the foods you eat, and the Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Information Center also notes that niacin allows the synthesis of fats and cholesterol within your body. You will get niacin if you order a beef burger, salad or sandwich with chicken breast or tuna salad. The daily value for niacin is 20 mg, and a 3-oz. serving of cooked lean ground beef has 3.1 mg niacin, 3 oz. of skinless white meat chicken provides 7.3 mg and a 3-oz. portion of canned tuna in water has 11.3 mg niacin. Niacin is also in enriched flour, so your hamburger bun or sandwich bread may also have niacin.
 
Riboflavin

The Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Information Center states that riboflavin helps you metabolize food and produce energy. The daily value for riboflavin is 1.7 mg per day, and deficiency is unlikely if you eat an adequate and varied diet. From a fast food restaurant, a cheeseburger or chicken sandwich would provide riboflavin, since beef and chicken have 0.08 to 0.16 mg per 3-oz. serving, enriched white bread has 0.08 mg per slice and cheddar cheese supplies 0.11 mg per oz. You may also get riboflavin from your dessert if you order a milkshake, or from your breakfast if you have eggs. Each 8-oz. serving of fat free milk provides 0.34 mg riboflavin, and a cooked large whole egg provides 0.27 mg.
