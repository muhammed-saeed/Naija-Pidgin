 Movie Post [10 Mar 2006| 05:47pm ] Today, I bussed to best friend&apos;s place and kept him entertained... he&apos;s having a very bad day. So we decided we&apos;d do what we always do... go to the cinema!

here are the movies I&apos;ve seen recently with Jan


Date Movie : Funny... not the best comedy i&apos;ve seen latelly, but it cracked me up a few times. The scene where they copied Mr. And Mrs. Smith was the best.

16 blocks : If you enjoy Bruce Willis, you&apos;ll love this movie. It somehow made me think about John Q (amazing &apos;hostage&apos; movie with Denzel Washington). Really good movie, sometimes predictable and at others, not at all! It was great, i consider you watch it.

Running Scared : I didn&apos;t like the movie that much at first, but I keep talking about scenes latelly. It was good afterall. The pimp is the best guy ever. and (SPOIIIIIIIIIIIILERRRRRRRRRRRRRR) pucks to the face and setting a guy&apos;s dick on fire is on my to do list now. The editing in this movie is awesome, somehow made me think of CSI.

Ultraviolet: You&apos;d think a movie by the guys that made Equilibrium (amazing movie with Christian Bale in it) would make another awesome movie. This movie started with a scene with ninjas in it... but they were quickly killed and the rest of the movie totally blew chunks. gigantic chunks. It sucked. Don&apos;t see this piece of crap. I swear, it&apos;s horrible!

I saw Shanan today when I was eating at the McDonald&apos;s with Jano. She isn&apos;t aware of it because she was outside with her brownhaired friend (who&apos;ve Ive forgot the name of... starts with a J maybe?) when I saw her. So Shanan, I lost my opertunity to say &apos;Zombies!&apos; and possibly kidnap you so you could see a totally awful movie. hazaahhh!


thats it.

P.S. &apos;Fuck&apos; and &apos;No&apos; are the best words ever. 6 comments | post comment
