2. Bumbu Bali - Tanjung Benoa

If ypu’re looking for an introduction to Indonesian and specifically traditional Balinese cuisine then a visit to Bumbu Bali should definitely be at the top of your list of places to eat.
The brainchild of Swiss born chef Heinz Von Holzen, former Executive Chef of the Grand Hyatt, Bumbu Bali is not so much an interpretation of local cuisine as a scientific study in progress of Indonesian recipes, many of with had never been recorded until Heinz set out to document them for the heart of Benoa styled as Balinese village and serving outstanding local food to otherwise‘warung-shy’visitors to the island.
The menu houses some fantastic treats. We opt for the Balinese Rijstaffel and are rewarded with a selection of satays and a personal favourite, the kambing meukahlamb slow simmered in coconut milk and spices. The ox tongue in sweet nutmeg sauce and the siap mepanggang (grilled chiken with a roasted coconut sauce) is also strongly recommended.
Cooking classes are also available and both informative and good fun. Check with the restaurant for more information.

7. The Italian, Amanusa–Nusa Dua

As with the things Aman in this worldit is the allure of lexury that tempts, both in the elegant poolside setting and naturally, the foodstuffs that find their way onto the end of your knife and fork.
I was under orders (explicit ones at that) from my dinner date to indulge in the antipasto table selections after her previous foray to the table some weeks ago.
At IDR 190.000 it’s an expensive enough entrée or a reasonable investment as main course, given that you can load your plate with slices of cured proscuitto, silvers of equisite salami and formidable array of fungi, not to mention the requisite tomato and feta salad, a large bowl of mixed olives and exceptionally tasty doorstop chuck of frittata.

My compatriot predictablysteered herself in the direction of whatever shrimpt might have found its way into the kitchen earlier in the day and ordered the Gamberoni freshwater prawns whilst I found my self contending with the wild boar bolognaise. As the menu rotates on an almost daily basis it’s hard to predict what the chef will have in store for his guests. This faultless sweet, with just the subtlest and of MArsala, a nutty expresso flavouring through the biscuit, velvety mascarpone and a heavy coating of cream on the top layer, has been many visiting diners to Amanusa a new addiction to placate.

17. BELLA SINGARAJA, Bali Intercontinental, Nusa Dua
The last word on fine Italian dining in the Jimbaran area rests rather peacefully at the beautiful Bella Singaraja restaurant in the ground of The Intercontinental Resort. Intriguingly the story behind the rather abstract name of this restaurant harkens to a haunting tale of a cross-cultural love affair between a Balinese maiden was said to maintain a solitary watch over the seas for her lover to return, scanning the horizon of Jimbaran Bay to no avail.
Obviously the price for the best story behind a restaurant in Bali goes to Bella Singaraja but what about the dining? No disasters and the Italian gent would, we’re sure, be very much appeased by the devotion of the chefs to his home country cuisine. With a choice between seating in the glass conservatory or al fresco on the decking overlooking the resort gardens, diners can indulge in various antipasti, appetizers, salads, pastas and an abundance of superior imported meat and seafood fresh from Jimbaran shorelines. As expected the wine cellar is huge and choice almost endless lending it self to some of the best Italian cuisine on the island.

19.di MARE, Karma Kandara, Uluwatu

Previously at the Karma Jimbaran Resort, di mare has upped and left for the heady heights of the new Karma Kandara property o the chef side of Uluwatu and what a transformation for chef Raymond Saja and the crew.
What we have here is arguably Bali’s restaurant with a view. What ofher chiff huggers on the Bukit peninsula should have done with such staggering panoramic views, di Mare has accomplished. Perched eight metres above sea level with the horizon lingering over your table and the word at your feat you might be forgiven for thinking that you’re never dine in such a grand location over again.
The success of Raymond’s Mediterranean at the previous di Mare has been transplanted with ease into the new surround. Be sure to try the grill opakapaka (caught off the water of Bali) with tomato carpaccio or the prawn trio chilled with tomato-horseradish sauce amongst many other offerings.
The resort inclinator will ferry guests down to the beach and the option of barbeque dining where you can pick the day’s from the lobster cages sunk of the Uluwatu reefs. An unusual and extremely recommended restaurant with a location to die for.

Most people who come to Bali want to know where the best seafood restaurant are. They have heard tales of fresh lobster, squid, giant prawns and sumptuous snapper just waiting to be sampled.
You don’t have to go to fancy or expensive restaurant to get the best seafood in Bali, because Jimbaran offers score of beachside restaurant. At night the restaurant put out touches and musicians wander from table to table serenading for tips. The atmosphere at once festive and romantic as you dine within steps of the waves on a gorgeous white sand beach.
There are too many restaurant to name them all, but one favourite is Quattro. Situated of the northern end of the beach, this restaurant provides both indoor and outdoor seating. It offers all the same great grilled seafood dishes, but some innovative ones as well like their‘Seafood Paella’, which come with an impressive assortment of oceanic fare.
Sharkey’s which is close by is another popular place. All of the restaurant charge by the kilo so you can eat as much or as little as you like at a moderate price. Jimbaran Bay is a great place to enjoy delicious fresh seafood at moderate prices but be prepared to bargain on prices and demand the‘local menu’.

21. HONZEN, Ritz-Carlton, Jimbaran

For those who want to seriously indulge in top end Japanese and Korean cuisine the answer lies within the leafy compound of The Ritz Carlton and its flagship honZEN restaurant.
I ordered a la carte from the menu, starling with the Kobe Beef then onto several gluttonous repeat orders of Torro tatty tuna before moving off in the direction of the set Sushi Mori before spying my old flame, the Bo Gyouza–pan fried pork dumpling. What the Japanese go for in taste the Korean camp more than make up for in sheer volume of food served to the table. Taking pity on my pleas for raw fish the staff presented an Aburi Sushi selection before trying to take my life with the ONION set menu.
Mercifully my dining companion had skipped breakfast and helped out with the stacked array of salads, fish, Bibimpap (cooked rice, vegetables, pickles and the raw egg to combine the ingredients) before the staff brought out the big guns with the deluxe beef sirloin, beef belly and salted beet tongue and left us toto our own devices with the coal barbeque grill in the center of the table. Teppanyaki is also an option in the two grill rooms.
honZEN might be an expensive option for Japanese cuisine in Bali but for unparalleled indulgence in the finest produce and skill of the chefs one has to be prepared to make a small financial sacrifice.

The restaurant provide a mix of local Asian and Western cuisine. The red lentil and Italian tomato soup is a recommended entrée before sampling the fine Indonesian cold salad GAdo-GAdo, a mix of bean sprouts, chillies and local vegetables, combined with egg and a spicy peanut sauce–a classic Indonesian dish that need no introduction and is definitely one of the archipelago’s finest cuisine offerings. The Bebek Memedi is a tender duck dish, slow cooked in hot chili sambal and lalapan (fresh vegetables).
Desserts dont drop in standard here with another local speciality–the banana fritters firmly in place on the menu and the classic Western favourite the humble apple pie present and correct.
Jendela can cater to parties up to 600 people and is a pleasing Indonesian diversion if you’re searching for a dining option on the Bukit.

28. SANGKAR, Bvlgari Resort, Uluwatu

Indonesian for‘bridcage’the favoured lunchtime spot at Bvlgari is one of the most picturesque spots in Bali for a light Asian bite or exquisite International fare.

Attempting to write the review as I overlook the stunning panorama of the South Indian Ocean proves to be as distracting as choosing from the expertly composed. Sangkar menu.

Take chef Andrew Skinner’s recommended of the cappuccino of sweetcorn with smoked salmon and chives or opt for the authentically Indonesian tum bebek (roasted duck with cassava leaves and spices cooked traditionally in banana leaves) and soto ayam Madura (a broth of chicken, candlenut and tumeric) before indulging in the island most luxurious nasi goreng with a lobster tail and wagyhu satay twist.

Other main course attractions include the North Sumatran dish–sambal udang (seared jumbo tiger prawns) and the bestselling Kobe beef burger. As with all thing Bvulgari attention to detail and presentation, not to mention the quality of ingredients is faultless.

Dessert is the highlight of any meal as Sangkar and is not to be skipped under any circumstance. The Alor Island Vanilla Crème Brulee with coconut cream and English favourite (betraying Andre’s roots) Apple Crumble with honeycomb ice cream are standouts.

40. KORI, Poppies Area
Kuta isn’t very well known for its culinary prowess. A million restaurant crowed the tiny interlocking lanes between Poppies Gang one and two, some good, most just the same menu repeated ad nauseam for the benefit of the backpacker market, cheap as chips, high on the MSG count and frankly pretty poor.

If you are looking for something more than just a calorie intake than the one exception to the Kuta rule is Kori, a long standing establishment that take its food seriously and succeeds, a fact that qualified by the restaurant remaining in business for the last ten years in a part of town where the average life expectancy of most eateries is somewhere around the six mount mark.

Try the Singaporean chili crab or giant meaty spare ribs, two of the most frequently ordered main courses by the Kori regular. Hot stone cooking is another popular pull for dining punters. Take your pick of the prime beef fillet, pork medallions or locally caught river prawns and cook your own dinner on the table to just the way you like it.

The restaurant comfortably seats 200 upstairs and downstairs in the Bale and private
Gazebo areas, and the best part of dining at Kori? You don’t have to brave the traffic out of Kuta to the more up market dinning establishment in Seminyak.

48. THE PLACE , Kuta Galeria
Big money cant always guarantee a big taste experience in Bali or anywhere else in the world for that matter. At IDR 39.500 for an all you can eat menu, lunches have been knows to stretch an entire afternoon at this Dim Sum emporium atop the Tiara Supermarket in Kuta Galery complex.
The literal Cantonese translation of‘dim sum’is touch the heart or order to your heart’s content, which is precisely the modus operandi of most diners when entering the hallowed doors of the restaurant, restraint doesn’t factor in to the equation when ordering lunch. Heaped plates of fried and steamed shrimp and pork dim sum appear then disappear before being restocked by the lingering wait staff.
Translunces rice flour gow is a difficult task to prepare but the chef almost always seem to do a fine task. The sui mai (small steamed dumplings with a pork inside a thin wheat flour wrapper) is consistently one of the best dishes on the menu, as is the steamed pork spare ribs with a black bean sauce.
Sundays are a holy day at The Palace, when the dim sum trolley does the rounds at the same price as the set menu and we are informed the restaurant get packed very quickly with the resident Chenese folk in Bali and visiting tourist alike looking for a cheap Asian style brunch.

55. TANAYA’S CAFÉ
Tanaya’s café was established in 1992. Soo after word began to spread about the Teppanyaki grill, eventually giving rise to the constant appreciation from return to the restaurant. Tanaya’s Café has become a favourite spot for casual Teppanyaki dining.

In Japanese,‘teppan’means iron plate or steel sheet, and‘yaki’means stir-fried food or stir-frying. The whole experience of having Teppanyaki, however, proves that these words are far more than the sum of their parts. Teppanyaki is stir-fried meat and vegetables, cooked and eaten off a large, table-top grill.
A mount-watering type of cuisine, which continues to increase in popularity as variations are made to suit all taste preferences.

Teppanyaki chefs have ample opportunity to demonstrate their skill, in spectacular displays of ingenuity, the chefs cut, stir, season and divide each guest’s portion onto plates on the teppan, keeping the food warm. Watching the chef prepare Teppanyaki is an important and exciting part of the meal. Veteran diners will eat and converse while glancing at the spectacle I front of them, whereas firs times will most likely have great difficulty taking their eyes off the performance.

59. BALE SUTRA, hotel Tugu
And now for something completely different. Possibly the most decadent dining experience on the island is realized in faultless lexury at Tugu Bali, home at the last bastion of interactive Indonesian heritage, and dining at Bale Sutra never fails to impress.
A 300 year old Kang Xi period temple that was almost demolished in the 1990’s in Java has been painstakingly reconstructed in its entirety and stands as symbol of harmony between the ancient Peranakan (Indonesian Chinese) and the ancient Balinese culture.
This temple is housed inside the dining room with a strong red theme running throughout. Dinner here is served on lavish antique silver and Ming Style tableware on an antique dinning table with 18th century gold-threaded Chinese silk and illuminated by rows of red candles.
The menu is billed as a royal dinner for the Chinese Dynasties so expect only the finest menu of traditional oriental cuisine served in a banquet procession.

60. BLOSSOM, Petitenget

Blossom’s winning menu has been given a partial overhaul, still including the best selling Thai dishes from the previous chefs but now including the global menu.
Start with the seared scallops, crispy duck, lime life, coconut and Thai basil and searedfoie gras with com cakes and creamed crab brandy snaps.
Main courses from the global menu include the confit of pork belly with vodka and cranberry jelly and braised red cabbage, and the Wagyu tenderloin with café de paris butter, light jus and crème potato blinis.
Dessert in Blossom is now much more of a treat for those that weren’t previously disposed to glutinous Thai sticky rice at the end of a meal.
Try the soft scented caramel and cumin pudding with white chocolate ice cream or the chocolate X 3 for a total cocoa overload of the palate. Gone are the crowds of Jakarta socialites crowding the bar and in their place is a more refined dining experience for the elegant discemer.

62. Café Bali, Jl.Laksamana
Café Bali opened back in April 2007 to a fanfare among the local expatriate crowd with their conservatively priced menu ranging from Japanese to France cuisine with a dabble in just about every continent in between.
The concept is very homely actually being a near replica of the Dutch architect Annelines Van Houten’s home. A colonial Javanese style seating with a very light and pretty ambience houses distressed, vintage style white furniture, comfly sofas and lot of picture frames. Its like a trip to tasteful grandmother’s living room and should by rights be an ill conceived hotchopotch of contrasing, ill executed ideas, but reassuringly it hangs together without being an all out assaulst on the senses.
The Hahkao dim sum sells well as does the beef carpaccio and the pepes ikan (teamed Balinese fish in banana leaves) from the Indonesian menu. The French style desserts are a treat from the very capable hands of chef Ibu Wayan (previously of Warisan fame), the apple tarte tatin, moelleux chocolate pudding and lemon meringue tart are all firm favourites with return visitors but not so much as the oversized strawberry margaritas being served in the adjoining bar with many people meeting just to sample this brain freeze creation.

The casual and relaxed café environment of Marzano has proven to be a big hit with expatriates in Bali and the quality of the home style Italian food being served here is testament to their continued success.
MArzano sits pretty on the up and coming Jl. Kunti Street, already home to some of Bali’s cheapest (and best) small restaurants. With the mix of outside dining by the roadside (perfect for people watching activities) or air conditioning interior (a necessity on hotter Bali evenings) you will very rarely find the place inhebited by any less than a full house.
Big appetites apply herein, try the foccacia starter followed by any one of the pizzas or calzones or try the tortellini panna and prosciuttio with its winning sauce, exemplary in its creaminess and texture whilst the pasta is cooked to perfections, not too al dente for its wonderfully buttery accompaniment.
The proscuitto is of the finest quality, this could be the dish worth stopping in at Marzano for launches here run a similar menu to evening service with a buffet option for those with less than gargantuan appetites. Specials rotate daily on the paper tablemats.

67. FRESH
Fresh is Japanese cuisine as you and I know it but with some modern twists and inventive new direction. Sure, you’ll be able to order your tuna sashimi and California maki rolls in confidence that you’ll be getting top notch quality but the real allure or fresh is in the assortment of oddball creations that tantalise and intrigue the dinner’s palate.
Take, for instance, the signature foie glas and mongo sushi or the funky fungus shitake fusion rolls, obscenely delicious turns of squid with salmon and cream cheese baked on a thin slice of lime with a teriyaki sauce.
Quite simply the spy rolls are the most inventive sushi combination I’ve discovered yet on the island.
The charm of fresh doesn’t stop at the al fresco style dining arrangement, it’s a perfect spot to sit and watch the world go by on the comfy wicker sofas whilst polishing off another jug or two of fruity cocktails.

70. GROCER&amp;GRIND, Petitenget
Originally the idea behind Grocer&amp;Grind was that of a one stop deli selling salads, antipastos, meats and of course sandwiches at sensible prices, something that can still be considered a foreign concept in this particular area of Seminyak where wallets seems to empty themselves at an alarming rate three times a day.
However, than the option of extending the deli into an adjoining restaurant arose the allure proved to be just too tempting for owner Marie and so the dining arm‘Grind was born’.
The supper club offers a small selection of well prepared tenderloin and fillets, open sandwiches, fish,risottos, soups, salad and pastas whilst the lunch options are predictably a salad and sandwich affair with a large antipasti selection of imported goodies. This breakfast menu with its morning after bloody marys, Moroccan eggs with spicy lamb sausage and the‘red carpet breakfast’make Grocer&amp;Grind an attractive mid range stop in for lazy recovery sessions in villasville.
White it maybe a relatively quite dining option compared to the crowded café and restaurants of Jl. Laksamana, Grocer&amp;Grind offers a mix relative serenity and the Australian style café culture to the area and they didn’t skimp on the parking facilities either.

74. KHAIMA, Jl.Laksamana- Oberoy
If you’re looking for something out of the ordinary where tasty dishes dance on the palate, with Kasbah ambience, belly dancers who seduce with delight, then you have come to the right place.
If you are in a diet, then this is not the place to come; thirty four individual spices go into the preparation of the cooking, most of which are imported from Morocco, whilst meat is imported from Australia. Every one of the four Moroccan signature dishes is as authentic as they come.
Couscous, the national dish of Morocco makes an appearance, served with marinated Australian lamb vegetables and an assortment of condiments for that acquired taste. Than come the desert, the Khaima Sampler a light and tasty pastry that dissolves in the mouth.
Finish up with a shot of bitter Moroccan coffee and the dining part is complete, now all you have to do is lie back and enjoy the floorshow as the bevy of belly dancing beauties add to the experience of Bali’s most well loved Moroccan restaurant.

75. Ku De’Ta, Jl.Laksamana–Oberoy
The institution that is Ku De Ta keeps on trucking years after attracting hordes of wannabe Seminyak poseuurs even though the real traiblazing people left the building econ ago.
Nowadays visitors here can expert to find a mix of holidaying families, bus load of vacationing Korean and Japanese as well as smattering of Western Stetsons presumably outlawed to Bali on charges of heinous crimes against good taste back in their native homelands.
And that is why we all love the place so. There still isn’t any other beachfront locations on the island that takes itself so seriously but is so much fun to dabble in. some come for the high seasons parties, others for the sundown cocktails but must to eat in what is one of the most expensive restaurant in the area. The cuisine has moved on somewhat from the‘modern Australian’menu pioneered back the early days and has grown to include more Asian fare including a‘grazing menu’designed to complement the new cocktail selection.
When laughter turns to tears (usually around the time the diner bill arrives) console yourself that Ku De Ta still has one of the best and tastiest breakfast deals in town and is definitely worth a return visit the following morning to sample.

76. LA LUCCIOLA , Oberoy
Here’s the places that really needs no introduction to the dining guide. The original Seminyak fine dining institutions on the Beach is still going strong after countless years and is packed to the upper floor rafters almost every night of the week in the winter peak season months. It is still one of the quintessential Bali restaurant to enjoy the setting sun whilst gracefully sipping quality cocktails and partaking in some of the very finest nouveau Australian cuisine.

The oysters topped with roe to start, served on rock salt are an excellent match to a strong martini or two. There may not be a huge amount of choice from the main courses with only seven dishes on offer but each is a journey into a divine taste experience. The grilled black Angus beef tenderloin with sweet potato puree, balsamic vinegar and roast shallots made its way to the table prepared to a perfect medium rare whilst the seafood stew with scampi, king prawns, snapper and cuttlefish met with the approval of my dinning companion.

Other templations from the main course menu include grilled Tasmanian salmon with dried tomato, lemon, celery and saffron aioli and the pan fried Hiramasa kingfish with artichoke hearts, baby spinach, Aeolian capers and citrus vinaigrette. The valhorna nought chocolate soufflé is amongst the best dessert find in Bali and segues perfectly into a bitter espresso the beautifully maintained grass lawn and sentimental palms overlooking the beach.

77. LA SAL, Jl. Drupadi
History reads that Alfonso (under doctor’s orders) was told eat small partions of food in between meals washed down with wine. Once healthy The King decreed that the pubs of Castilla not serve any wine without food. It was a wise choice, as in the world of our La Sal proprietor Gonzalo,‘the alcoholic vapours would not include the garlic prawns in a garlic and truffle oil (a plate of crunchy mushrooms with red capsicum aioli).
Then there’s the good, old fashioned paella served in a very traditional manner (a landmark dish for La Sal and the reason most diners return time after time) and the close contender for the winning dish, the twice cooked lamb. Finish up with a divine Argentinean toffee pancake and chocolate mousse tart served with a fantastic balsamic vinegar reduction that lands just the right amount of acidity to the richness of the dessert.
Hands down the best authentic Spanish restaurant yet in Bali.

87. PAUL PLACE THAI KITCHEN, Jl. Laksamana- Seminyak
Now, here’s the place that’s out of the norm for most diners in The Seminyak area: part spa, part fashion boutique, and part furniture store with the restaurant thrown in the good measure. The actual open the restaurant, up on the third floor, with a cool view over the last remaining Laksamana rice field is reason enough to hoist your self up the stairs and when you get up there you realise the food and cocktail on offer aren’t half bad either.
Owner Paul Meng claims that Paul’s simply an extention of his own personal taste, a place where he can entertain, as if it was his home and its this nation behind the Thai Kitchen that makes the restaurant arm on the enterprise such a joy to indulge. For starters the cocktail here are amongst the best on the block; try the lychee martini here and you’ll be hooked instantly, the same as the ribs that are the best I’ve come across south of Ubud.
The menu navigates across the boundaries of Thai food into some great sushi dishes with a passing nod the international tastes along the way. Check out the Thai sweet coconut rice with mango for dessert and take a few moments to appreciate just how unique this lesser known restaurant actually is. Paul’s place is a lot of fun in a very casual and relaxed environment and far more intimate than slogging it out with a hundred other diner in the bigger restaurants around this side of Bali, so you can expert the service to be excellent and the most part it certainly is.

89. QUEEN TANDOOR, Seminyak
Firmly planted on the cushions upstairs in Queen Tandoor, with a bird’s eye view over Legian, diners can watch the street parade of motorcyclist and foot soldiers batting their way up and down one of Bali’s busiest streets as they tuck into same very fine Indian cuisine.
Green pea, potato and cashew samosas gave way to a perfectly barbequed leg of tandoor chicken. There’s not much in my book that beats a free-range satay chicken, Indonesian style, but this come a very close second in the taste department for the quality of the meat used and of course the preparation with the tandoor spices and cooking in the Queen’s clay oven.
Next up try the prawn Goa curry with a rogan josh and a delightful buttered moong dhal accompanied by sweet Kashmiri naan and a mound of imported long grain basmati.
Plates of fragrantly spiced South Indian delights appear here as if by magic, a mix of dosas and snapper served in a fierce dhal that doesn’t appear on the menu but will in the near furniture the owners inform us.
Round off your Queen’s meal with some(distinctly un Indian) chocolate brownies and there you have arguably the island best Indian meal in one of Bali’s most respected Indian restaurant’s.

There’s so much variatation on offer on Seminyak‘eat street’it can sometimes be a chore trying to decide where to park oneself for dinner. Its easy to lose track of the amount of drive bys that can be conducted on various establishment when searching for some hunger abating inspiration.
Firs up the tuna in filo rolls, pink in the center and fresh enough that can still smell the ocean in the flash, so good you’ll be more than likely to throw the pot in and order a second helping before maybe opting for a 200g Rumors special tenderloin, cooked blue with a generous side order of Cajun spiced potato wedges and green pepper sauce eased down with a very rude Rumors frozen margarita.
Third and final is the brulee with a twist to the classic recipe, its oven baked with lime zest that takes the saccharine edge off the crime anglaise. The lid is crispy without a hint of burned caramel, top marks. I’ll event stick my neck out and say this could possibly be the best brulee on the island so the hunt is on for a worthy contender.

92. SUKERTIS, Jl. Pantai Berawa, Canggu
Its not very much to look at from the outside; there’s no fussy décor, fancy pathways to the restaurant or water installations in the garden to gawp at, there’s not even a view to take in.
It all looks a bit like a pretentious warung and with the family name Sukertis you could be forgiven for expecting the place to serve some upscale nasi goreng may be with a couple of European dishes thrown on the chalkboard to make it‘truly international’as so many places in Bali do. However on closer inspection the menu betrays a much more ambitions project at hand.
A duck liver parfait with mango salsa and consommé jelly, salmon, swordfish and seaweed terrine on rondels of cucumber, Seared tuna fish salad nicoise, tamarind grazed pork, the list goes on and on than you notice the specials charkboard and take a further step back in disbelief.
The chef, Paul Burrows, is a veritable food junkie having spent fifteen years in Bali and clearly creates with great pride.
Once you have discovered this place (and it does take some discovering in the maze of country lanes) you’ll find it hard not to return time and time again.

104. ARENA, By pass Ngurah Rai, Sanur
Without prior intelligence Arena is a hard place to stumble across: situated right next to McDonalds on the Sanur by pass its not the beach dining scene that visitors demand.
If you don’t know about the reputation that owner Olaf and the restaurant have garnered in the four and a half years Arena has been open you’ll never give the dowdy exterior of the place a second glance, let alone entertain the nation that it might be one of Bali’s premier eating spots.
The cavernous, pub like interior plays home to an extremely well stocked bar (an expatriate demand), extensive wine cellar with selections primarily from Chile and Australian and two pages of the menu devoted to the joys of beer. Ciusine wise the menu successfully veers across several countries.
The most popular dish on the menu is the much imitated in Bali but really bettered honey back pork ribs, the real reason to darken the doors of Arena and without the shadows of a doubt some of the best ribs on the island, period. If it’s a quest for perfect steak than you will be well rewarded with the generous portions of filet supremely roasted on the volcanic grill and served with a choice of sauces. A great spot for some home cooked soul food visited frequently by some of Bali’s most revered chefs.

106. MEZZANINE, Jl. Cemara
With the menu playing host to cuisine from Thailand, Japan and the West (not the mention a Teppanyaki grill) the choices on offer at Mezzanine are virtually endless.
First up as trip to France for the pan fried duck foie gras served on short grain rice and avocado puree with honey and soy, an interesting and bold combination but rather heavy for a starter. My dining partner is for more restrained and take flight to Japan for some very well prepared sushi and sashimi ordered a la carte.
Main courses are served and I choose the slow roasted rack of lamb with miso and blue cheese and my companion hands off the Thailand for sizeable, very fresh bowl of tom yam goong, prepared by Mazzanine’s resident Thay chef.
Dessert is next and the highlight of the meal for me is the hefty serving of a very simple Toblerone chocolate mousse, one of the least fussy, but most rewarding sweets I’ve encountered in Bali.
Whatever your culinary predilections there’s something to satisfy every plate when dining here.

107. SLAVYANKA, Jl. By Pass Ngurah Rai
With all the red and whites on display in Slavyanka you’d be forgiven for thinking that you’d stumbled into an extremely patriotic Indonesian fine dining establishment. One entire wall pays homage to the great Tsar of Russia from the Rurik to the Romanov Dynasties whilst the rest of the premises celebrate the latter day marvel of fine wines, champagnes and well, Vodka!
Try the Bag of Pilgrim, pork wrapped in dough pouches or the Herring Under Greatcoat, a salad of boiled vegetables and herring covered in beetroot to start.
The pancake with Frenc Blame (miced chicken and spices cooked in a white wine sauce and wrapped in a pancake) that are already firm favourites amongs expatriate visitors to the restaurant, the Armenian Shashlik from the outdoor grill and Venison with Cranberry sauce are both standouts from the main course selection.
The real winner on the menu is the excellent Hussar’s Stile Chicken Liver, pan fried chicken liver with onion, and than cooked in clay pot with sour cream and red wine.
A very different dinging experience for anyone looking to sample cuisine out of the norm, and yet further evidence that Bali’s is home to a very diverse dining circuit.

109. THE VILLAGE, Jl. Danau Tamblingan, Sanur
These guys keep on producing the goods when it comes to quality Italian cuisine in Sanur and for good reason. Chef Giargio Boattini has devoted his life to serving top drawer food and has run no less than seven restaurants in his time prior to finding his way to Bali and into the hearts (and mouths) of many an Italian dining aficionado, not to mention publishing a book based on the dishes he prepared for Ristorante la Pineta Fasello Pontinvrea in Savona back in the early eighties.
Stars with the traditional ceasar salad before sampling the fusilli pasta with gorgonzola cheese and spinach prepared perfectly al dente and the scaloppini al vivo bianco, a thin sliced beef fillet flambéed with white wine sauce served with mixed vegetables and roasted potatoes.
The firewood pizzas are a great option if you’re looking for a lighter evening bite ao try the outstanding ossobuco con piselli, braised veal shark with tomato sauce, angel hair pasta and green peas, a favourite of a particularly well known Ubud chef resident in the Sanur area. The dolci course doesn’t disappoint either, with the cream al caramello, vanilla custard served with caramel sauce being graciously accepted by our table. Some places just get it right time after time and The Village is one of them, very highly recommended.

110. ARY’S WARUNG, Ubud Main Street
One of Ubud’s better known restaurants (primarily for its location right on the main street Ubud road) has endured a makeover to drag it into the 21st century without losing too much of its original aesthetic appeal to lunch and dinner visitors. Gone is the warung atmosphere of old (Ary’s was originally part of an old Balinese family compound) and instead a plush and modern interior on two floors replaces the dining benches of yesteryear.
What Ary’s is exceptional for is its people watching: take a seat on the comfortable sofas at the front of the downstairs floor and the carnival of Ubud life on the street outside will both entertain and mesmerize as you indulge in the six course contemporary Asian degustation menu with dishes such as the confit pork belly and zucchini flowers and kaffir lime chocolate of Ubud.
Most come here for the relaxed ambience, decent music(at last, somewhere that plays decent jazz on the island, and at the respectable rate of decibels), martinis and to relax after a long day of temple viewings and shopping in the adjacent boutiques that litter the streets of Ubud.
Ary’s also offers an extensive wine list from their cellar and cigars on the downstairs floor whilst the open plan upper level commands views over the village temple and water garden temple.

119. LAMAK, Jl.Monkey Forest–Ubud
Dramatic design by renowned architect and landscape artist Made Wijaya is complemented by steel sculpture from Pintor Sirait lending to the restaurant a bright and contemporary appearance (love those blue table).
On two floors the vibe is very relaxed: downstairs in a tropical fresco dinning environment whilst upstairs is more a formal, classical dining affair that manages to retain the funky flair of Wijaya’s design eye.
The real treat at Lamak is the excellent menu from chef Ronald (also the man in charge of Warung Enak, another Ubud taste Insitute). You can expect to be surprised and rewarded in equal measures with a cuisine on offer. The open lobster lasagna, gratinated ocean trout, sesame crusted seared scallops with kung pao sauce and lamb rack cutlets are all outstanding dishes on the menu.
Just when you think matters cant improve any further the sweet menu looms, into view with a show stopping raspberry soufflé. Once bitten by Lamak you’ll be back for return visits, most likely on a daily basis. Open for lunch and dinner.

121. MOZAIC, Jl. Raya Sanggingan–Ubud
Possibly Bali’s best restaurant, Mozaic rewrites kitchen rules with a hyberd France/ Asian menu that both evades and defies description.
Opt for the specials tasting menu and let Cris Salans steer you into the unknown, sit back and sup your Chardonnay as the outdoor kitchen breathes life into the twinkling candelit sunken garden, savor the cool mountainous, atmosphere as the plates start arriving.
It’s a tour de force dining experience, six courses with optional (but recommended) wine pairing. From the exceptional Crispy Seared Duck Foie Gras, Young Balinese Starfruit and Sweet and Sour Broth to the Rosemary Braised Tasmanian Salmon Fillet in a Pernod infused Bouillabaise Emulsion.
The plates are combined and matched to the wine list with such razor precisions that any distractions from other tables in the garden become insignificant, save for the roaming gaze of your dining compatriots as they scope the next dish being presented by the knowledgeable and personable service staff.
The recently lauched, Miele sponsored cooking school and private dining table to the rear of the garden are worth exploring should you wish to improve your culinary knowledge or simply indulge in a private dining experience with Cris at the helm.

122. MURNI’S WARUNG, Jl. Raya Campuhan- Ubud
This landmark restaurant overlooking the Campuhan ravine really needs no introductions as it truly one of Ubud and Bali landmark dining establishments. Presided over by the ever gracious Ibu Murni, the four tier restaurants leads guest into the natural hearts of the gorge with shadowy bamboo and rustic stone complimented by Indonesian atwork on display to create a very surreal and traditional Balinese dining experience.
Order the house specialty the Balinese duck, stuffed with local spices and baked so the meat is tander and juicy, sit back and let the echo of the waterfall carry you to a bygone era of Ubud. A garden era where Charlie Chaplin, Margaret Mead, Noel Coward and other pioneering Bali visitors would have occupied your very spot, most propably have ordered similarly and have been entertained by Ibu Murni’s mother’s food. The menu is an eclectic collision of Indonesian styles, the service impeccable and the surrounds truly beautiful.
Upstairs in the entrance to the warung is Ibu Murni’s gift shop selling reasonably priced home wares and Balinese artifacts. There is also the option of accommodation, again at budget friendly prices.
Rarely ever busy, simply because not that many people know about its existence, Murni’s Warung is a real find if you are in Ubud and comes highly recommended.

123. NAUGHTY NURI’S, Jl. Singgingan
The reputations of Nuri’s is legendary. Name me other warung in the archipelago that attracts such as diverse collections of characters and I’ll eat my pencil.
Anthony Bourdain visited after a disastrous run in with a sprig of parsley down the road, Donna Karen’s poked her nose in, Dolph Lungdren’s been sofed propping up the bar wondering why no one’s pastering him for an autograph and event Travis Bickle himself Robert de Niro has been spied behind a dark pair of glasses and a large hat, presumably chomping the pork ribs, one of the two reasons has become such a must visit place in Bali.
The other reasons, and one that many people favour over the barbecue ribs, is the ridiculously potent, downright dangerous martinis served up, so strong and expertly crafted that Bourdain himself proclaimed them the‘best outside New York’.
Thursday see Tuna night from the grill and are a draw for expatriates across the island. Hot Dogs, burgers and an assortment of Indonesian cuisine is also on the menu throughout the week. Drink sensibly here; those martinis are virtually pure alcohol.
Expect to meet a wide variety of dubious local characters cluttering up the place.
