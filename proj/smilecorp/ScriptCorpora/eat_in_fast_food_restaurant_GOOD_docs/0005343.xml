STAMFORD -- Sheila Davalloo, the self-represented defendant on trial for the 2002 murder of Anna Lisa Raymundo , rested her case Tuesday after centering her defense on testimony from a convicted burglar and questions over whether she made the 911 call alerting police to the homicide.

Prosecutors accused Davalloo, a 42-year-old former pharmaceutical researcher from Pleasantville, N.Y., of killing Raymundo because of an obsessive desire to rekindle an affair with her boyfriend, a co-worker at Purdue Pharma in Stamford. It&apos;s part of the same motive Westchester County prosecutors used to convict Davalloo of attempted murder in 2004, a year after she stabbed her former husband while playing a game involving handcuffs and blindfolds.

A central witness in Davalloo&apos;s defense, Gary Riley , a former Stamford resident who served a five-year prison sentence for burglary, testified to seeing a man and woman arguing outside a Harbor Drive housing complex before police found Raymundo dead in her waterfront condo from multiple stab wounds and blunt head trauma on Nov. 8, 2002.

The prosecution, in turn, picked apart Riley&apos;s credibility, casting him as a drug-addled alcoholic who changed his story several times in order to cut a deal for his release from prison.

His testimony comes during the third week of testimony in Davalloo&apos;s murder trial at state Superior Court in Stamford. Davalloo began mounting her defense last week following nearly eight days of testimony from more than a dozen prosecution witnesses. In contrast, Davalloo called one witness last Friday and five more on Tuesday before resting her case. She faces 25 to 60 years in prison if convicted. She is serving a 25-year prison sentence for trying to kill her husband.

Riley, 51, wore tinted glasses and a black fleece jacket as he testified. He said he was fishing off a nearby hurricane barrier on the morning of Raymundo&apos;s death and passed through her condo complex as he walked to his car. He said he saw a man and woman arguing outside the complex.

Riley said he couldn&apos;t hear what the man and woman argued about. When Davalloo presented him with a photo of Raymundo, he couldn&apos;t positively identify her as the woman he supposedly saw that morning.

Riley said after leaving the condo complex that morning he went to a fast food restaurant on Shippan Avenue; a woman called 911 from this restaurant at 12:13 p.m. to alert police to the Raymundo homicide. Officers interviewed him there and questioned him about the homicide at police headquarters. Police ruled him out as a suspect because of several lies he told investigators.

Stamford police investigators arrested Riley for burglary after finding stolen fishing poles in his car shortly after the homicide. While testifying on Tuesday, Riley admitted he stole from boats docked off Harbor Drive.

Riley said police took several statements from him in the months following the Raymundo homicide, and a final one in 2008. In the last statement, he told police he lied about seeing two men throw a knife into the water at the Czescik Marina docks and that he saw an older woman make a 911 call from the fast-food restaurant.

Riley said he couldn&apos;t remember the 2002 incident or the several statements he gave police.

&quot;I didn&apos;t recall half of what I said back then,&quot; Riley said.

&quot;Because it&apos;s difficult to remember lies, right?&quot; said the prosecutor, Supervisory Assistant State&apos;s Attorney James Bernardi .

Bernardi read portions of the 2008 statement to jurors. In one, Riley apologized for all the lies he told police during their investigation. In another, he said he only saw a woman walking her dog and another woman crouching behind a stairwell in the condo. Riley told Bernardi the argument he testified about did not occur near Raymundo&apos;s condo.

Bernardi spent more than an hour attacking Riley&apos;s credibility, moving to impeach him because he omitted witnessing the argument in his 2008 statement. Judge Richard Comerford denied the motion, but moments later removed the 16-person jury and chastised Bernardi for trying to turn Riley into a prosecution witness as he continued to recount his inconsistent statements.

Comerford pulled Bernardi into chambers, and after a short recess the prosecutor finished his cross-examination of Riley by asking him about cooperating with police in 2003 to get out of jail. Davalloo hadn&apos;t asked Riley about the two times, according to her arrest affidavit, that he accused other people of the murder, so the accusations did not come up during Bernardi&apos;s cross-examination.

Davalloo had several former co-workers from Purdue Pharma testify about the 911 call made from a fast food restaurant pay phone the day Raymundo was killed. Earlier in the trial, Bernardi played the recording of a frantic woman telling a 911 dispatcher she saw a man attacking her neighbor. Two former co-workers said they could not say for certain whether the voice on the 911 call belonged to Davalloo. One said the voice did not belong to Davalloo.

Two weeks ago, a voice recognition expert testified he used digital voice analysis software to determine Davalloo was the 911 caller. The expert said he took a recording of Davalloo&apos;s voice in 2004 and failed to find a match when he compared it to the 911 call. Last year, however, he used more recent software to make a second comparison, this time finding a match between Davalloo&apos;s voice and the 911 caller.

Davalloo asked Stamford police Officer Ed Rondano , the final defense witness, whether Nelson Sessler , Raymundo&apos;s boyfriend and Davalloo&apos;s former lover, had visible injuries on the day Raymundo was killed.

Davalloo had previously asked Sessler about a red knuckle, swollen cheek and scratched back when he testified during the first week of the trial. Sessler denied the injuries. Rondano said investigators photographed Sessler the night of Nov. 8, 2002. He could only recall Sessler having a discolored mark on his shoulder and back that could have been a scratch. A different officer described the other injuries in his own report, Rondano said.

Before resting her case Tuesday afternoon, Davalloo tried to introduce several pieces of evidence, including information about cell phone towers, a recorded conversation between her and Sessler in 2003, and a mitochondrial DNA test on a hair sample found somewhere in the crime scene. She also wanted to have jurors hear about a bloody sock found in the condo complex parking lot more than month after the Raymundo homicide. Comerford denied each piece of evidence based on relevancy concerns and the lack of expert witnesses to testify about the more complex issues.

Comerford scheduled closing arguments for 2 p.m. Wednesday, giving Davalloo the morning to prepare. Each side gets an hour to pitch their case to the jury. Davalloo motioned for an acquittal just before court adjourned.

&quot;This is a circumstantial case,&quot; Davalloo said. &quot;I understand it&apos;s in the hands of the jurors, the triers of fact. There are no eyewitnesses or murder weapon. No one knows what the intent of the perpetrator was.&quot;

Comerford denied her motion, saying the court heard enough evidence to let a jury decide a verdict. The judge added that a jury can also determine intent.
