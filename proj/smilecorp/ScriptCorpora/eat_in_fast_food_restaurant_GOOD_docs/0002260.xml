I left this establishment with a full tummy (for those that know me this is rare).

Had the #1 Chicken dish for $9 after tax.  Portions are great, 1/2 lb chicken, 1 cup yellow rice and 1 cup of black beans.  The whole dish is unbelievable, chicken just melts off the bone, juice in every bite (makes great left overs), beautifully seasoned and compliments the beans and rice.

We were at the far end of Duval and needed something to eat. The place did not look promising, with it&apos;s fast food look counter combined with former tenants decor on the walls and a bad lay out. But what they didn&apos;t  put into remodeling and decorating they put into the food.
It was one of the best meals we had in Key West. The wife had the 1/4 chicken and I had the pork chop meal. Very well spiced  with very tasty side dishes of plantains, black beans and yellow rice.  A huge meal that left me stuffed for the night.
The prices were very reasonable with meals running from $7 to $10 dollars.
Go there before they decide they have to Americanize for the tourists.

Reasonably priced Peruvian food in a casual &quot;fast food&quot;-like setting. The food is actually  prepared fresh, so it is not really &quot;fast food&quot;, but the prices and setting are like a fast food restaurant. I ordered the ceviche mexito and was amazed at the size of the huge pile of ceviche I received. It was very tasty! I have not been to Peru but I have visited Ecuador and this ceviche was similar to what I tried various places in Ecuador, therefore I judge it as being reasonably authentic.. Also tried the chicken, which is a Peruvian style rotisserie chicken and was great.   The Duval Street strip in Key West is full overpriced tourist traps this place is a break from that scene with high quality food.  The one problem is that seating is rather limited, the manager explained to me that this is because the city of Key West charges an exorbitant rate for a license for each seat and table in the restaurant and this resulted in somewhat limited seating capacity. So if it is busy, just get your food to go and walk down the street to a park and eat your food on a bench..

We missed lunch and we saw this little store. so we tried the food. I had the 1/4 lb chicken special. Naturally when i saw the pic it just look like a chicken leg and i thought to myself i could eat it. It was half a chicken leg with rice, bananas and black bean soup. For three people it was reasonably priced. I think we spent $30.00 dollars. It was clean and the staff were friendly. It recently open so it wasn&apos;t crowded but their were people coming in and out. It appeared they do takeout too. If we ever go to The florida keys again i&apos;ll eat their again.
