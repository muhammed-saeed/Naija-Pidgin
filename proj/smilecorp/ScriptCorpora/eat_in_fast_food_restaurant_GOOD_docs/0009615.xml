It&apos;s not a buffet, so everything is prepared to meet the customers&apos;requests, which makes it better than most local Chinese restaurants. However, the language barrier creates a problem if you want to make changes to a menu item. My co-worker is a vegetarian and wanted a dish prepared w/o meat and the waitress acted as though she understood, but... More

I live in the DC area now, and I have yet to find a Thai restaurant that is as good and as consistent as banana leaf. I Took the place for granted when I lived in Frostburg and only went for special occasions. The green curry is the real deal, and the service is on point. If you like Thai... More

Living in DC, food is evetywhere. My favorite neighborhood chinese place open for 30 years closed. This place is the next best thing. Great, friendly service, great prices for the portions given (which are on the large side) and delicious food. Nothing on the menu isn&apos;t delicious. Support this awesome local business please!

We almost always have the mussamen curry -- mostly because it is excellent and we have never found anything else on the menu we like better even though everything I have tried has been very good.
Service is always excellent.
Ambience is good -- I think the place is an old fast-food restaurant so don&apos;t expect anything fancy.
As in... More

Several different restaurants have been in this location in the past, but this is the best iteration yet. There are two different menus: Thai and&apos;standard Americanized Chinese&apos;, and honestly you can&apos;t go wrong with either.

My husband and I LOVE the Banana Leaf! I&apos;ve been eating here periodically since 2003, and the food and service have always been great. It&apos;s never crowded (they get a lot of take out business), so you can always grab a seat. Order the jasmine tea. I recommend the chicken soup to start, it&apos;s got coconut milk, chicken, mushrooms, and... More

We were told there is no good Asian restaurant in Western Maryland. Not! The Banana Leaf serves both Thai and Chinese. My preference is Thai and I have never been disappointed with any of the meals I have tried so far. Servings are large (we often order a&quot;dinner&quot;at lunch and take home enough for at least one home... More
