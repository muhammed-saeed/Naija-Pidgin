Sneaky Ways to Save Money
 Submitted by Kristy on May 16, 20088:00 am 12 Comments 
We all know that saving money is hard, especially given the way the economy is going. It’s always the same thing. We say we’ll save on the next raise or when the car is paid off, but we never do. Savings has become something that we do when all of our other bills are paid off and, unfortunately, that’s not working for us. The reality is that there usually isn’t anything left over after we’ve paid all of our bills so we have to change our mindsets in order to achieve any savings .

Now, I say we because I have been guilty of this in the past. I’m very good at maxing out my contributions and then some to my retirement accounts; however, I’m not always so good with my liquid savings . Ideally, you want about six months worth of expenses saved, just in case . And in an economy where the job market is so uncertain, this really becomes important.

Now then, how do we build up a savings account and not feel the crunch anymore than we already do? Here are some tricks I’ve tried that have worked for me (and, they’re working for other people too because Bankrate.com posted a similar article about sneaky practices.)

 1.) Treat your savings like a bill 

I personally set my savings account up as a bill in my online bill pay that is automatically drafted every pay period. I tried having my employer just take a portion from my check and deposit it to savings, but that didn’t work because in my mind I still had that money. Thinking of it as a bill changes my perspective. I don’t think of that money as mine anymore. It belongs to the savings account. Ok, so technically it’s still mine; however, since I changed my mindset I haven’t pulled from the account like I would before when it was just a transfer from my paycheck.

 2.) Live at least one raise behind 

When you get your next raise, don’t include the extra money in your budget. Put that money in savings. You’re already used to living on the old salary, so instead of increasing your spending put the extra money away for a rainy day. Then, on the next raise, increase to what the previous raise was and put the rest away. You live behind the raises and it will help you spend less than you make, plain and simple.
 
 3.) Get cash back 

Anytime you go shopping and you’re asked if you want cash back, say yes. I know, I know. That sounds very defeatist to what we’re trying to accomplish, right? Not really. You’re not going to spend that money. Take and make a deposit to your savings or put it in a piggy bank you can stash away in your home. Don’t just leave it in the account and think you’ll transfer it because that rarely works out. Plus, as cash back you count it as part of the original purchase and then forget about it. Pretty sneaky, huh?

 4.) Fast Food Jar 

This works a lot like a curse jar where you add money when you curse. Every time you eat out at a fast food restaurant, add a dollar (or whatever amount you prefer) to the jar. This works on two things at once, if you think about it. If you eat out a lot, this method is going to show you just how much. Each time you add the dollar (or whatever you chose) you’ll see that jar building up with money. It’s great for your savings, but it’s going to make you really consider eating out. It does require some discipline, though. You can’t commit to this and then cheat because you don’t want to pay the jar a dollar. If you don’t think you can do this one, I recommend choosing other methods!

 5.) Start your own laundry mat 

Put a jar over the washer and dryer and each time you use either, add a quarter. Like the fast food jar, you have to be committed, but it’s a great way to see your savings add up. Once the jars are full, take them to your bank or local grocery store and exchange them for larger bills TO BE PUT DIRECTLY INTO SAVINGS. 

 Can you think of any other sneaky ways to save?

I had just read this article, and then you have almost the exact same method for #1!

The only problem I see with the Fast Food jar and the Laundry Jar, I never have cash with me, I guess I could do the fast food one with my ING account, for every time I see it on a statement move x dollars over to another“Jar”account.

I do really like the idea of the eating out penalty, it helps against health reasons too!

Hi Philip,

That’s funny that the reader who posted the question in your link does have a similar method. And here I thought I could really market that technique! (Just kidding). But, it really is effective to think of it as a bill. Totally different mind set.

The Fast Food Jar is one of my favorites too, because I do eat out a lot. I stay within my budget, but if I were to eat at home more, I’d have more money to save. So, I implemented this method and it has helped a lot. There are days that I just know it’s a fast food day, so I pull a dollar out of my account before I leave work and I’m good to go. I will say with your twist to this method, that’s a good idea; however, make sure you actually stick to it. If you’re only doing it once a month when you look at your statement you run the risk of not“having”the money once bills are due and then it just defeats the purpose. But, if you’re disciplined enough to make it work, go for it! Be sure to pop back in and let us know how it’s working for you!

Thanks for the laundry mat idea. I’ll have to use that one.

You’re welcome! I hope works for you!

Hey there! I just stumbledupon this site and I’m enjoying what I see so far. I love this article.

I really like #1 and #2. This will be very helpful to me in the near future. I never thought of it like that but thanks to you now I can!

#4 would be great for saving for me as well, as I tend to eat out A LOT.

A variant on the cash back idea–I collect the coin change from my drive-thru trips for coffee and food and deposit it into savings every few weeks.
 Rob says: July 12, 2008 at 10:10 am 
I take an Oberweis glass milk jug and put all of my singles and fives into it from the cash I have on hand. I only keep bills on me that are tens and up to pay for goods. Once it gets packed to the top, you can start fishing the money back out so long as you folded it nicely to get it in the hole in the top.

It makes you think about taking that money out and using it, as it’s quite difficult to fish out all of the money. Once you have it filled up, it’s usually worth a few hundred dollars and it shows how easy it is to save a little at a time to get a nice reward! Keep a second jug for change, as putting both in the same jug makes less room for the cash.

Rob, I do the same thing. 1′s, 5′s, and change go into jars. Also, I have online banking, so I have my account set up to withdraw 10 from checking to savings 2 times a month. Also, I don’t allow myself to know what is in savings. Also, you can start a COD at your bank, ask your teller how. And another trick is when i buy myself a treat like candy or such, I match the price into my savings jar. It makes you think twce before buying, because the price tag has suddenly doubled.
