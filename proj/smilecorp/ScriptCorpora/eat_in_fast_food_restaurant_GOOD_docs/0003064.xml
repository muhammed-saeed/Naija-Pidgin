 8-31-08 Modesto Bee Calif. land use subject to global warming review...DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer...8-30-08 http://www.modbee.com/state_wire/story/412966.html For decades, California cities and counties knew one way to grow - by sprawling outward. That approach, which has led to ever longer commutes, jammed freeways and worsening air quality, is being challenged under a bill that was approved Saturday in the state Legislature. The bill would require local governments to plan their growth so homes, businesses and public transit systems are clustered together. The goal is to help California meet the emission mandates spelled out in a wide-ranging greenhouse gas reduction law passed two years ago. At the same time, it will encourage housing to be built closer to where people work and shop while discouraging the type of suburban sprawl that has characterized California&apos;s development pattern for decades. It requires local governments to submit regional development plans to state air regulators for approval, making them eligible for billions of dollars in state and federal transportation grants. Sen. Darrell Steinberg, the bill&apos;s author, said it has drawn support from groups that typically are adversaries: home builders, environmentalists, advocates for affordable housing and local government officials. He called it&quot;the coalition of the impossible.&quot; Steinberg said the legislation&quot;allows California to grow, but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals.&quot; California would be the first state to impose such statewide requirements on local land-use decisions and connect them to concerns about global warming. It is one of many steps the state is taking to meet the mandates of the 2006 law, which requires all greenhouse gas emissions statewide to be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. The state Senate approved the bill on a 25-14 vote. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has championed the 2006 law, has not indicated whether he will sign it... His bill requires the California Air Resources Board to work with local governments to set regional targets for reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Those targets would be used in transportation plans for each of the state&apos;s 17 metropolitan regions. Similarly, the state would create regional housing plans that take into account the transportation plans, putting more homes near rail and bus lines and within a short commuting distance of major employers. Local governments and transit agencies that comply would get faster regulatory approval, including an easing of the usual environmental review requirements. That provision allows a major concession to developers by making it more difficult for opponents to sue them as a way to stop projects... Fresno Bee Bill to reward smart growth Bipartisan effort addresses several of state&apos;s biggest problems...Editorial http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/story/833236.html An innovative bill changing the way land-use decisions are made in California is moving through the Legislature and should land on the governor&apos;s desk soon. It may wait there a while, since the governor is still determined to hold up most legislation until a budget deal is achieved. But the measure, Senate Bill 375, by Sen. Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, is a carefully crafted effort to rein in sprawl, cut greenhouse gas emissions, boost mass transit and increase the amount of affordable housing in the state. It deserves the governor&apos;s signature. The bill is complicated, reflecting the fact that Steinberg has worked hard on it for two years, trying to assemble an unlikely coalition of environmentalists, the residential building industry and local governments . But basically, it would reward local governments for adopting&quot;smart growth&quot;policies in their general plans that encourage denser urban growth, the use of mass transit and shortened commute times. The incentive, in return: Growth that meets those standards would have a higher priority for state transportation funding than areas that don&apos;t comply. The state&apos;s Air Resources Board will be setting targets for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, part of the process of implementing Assembly Bill 32, California&apos;s historic effort to attack global warming. Local and regional governments would have to create land-use policies that reflect those goals to move ahead in line for transportation funding. Cities and counties would still be free to sprawl to their hearts&apos; content, but growth outside the target parameters wouldn&apos;t qualify for the funding break, a powerful incentive to grow wisely. SB 375 is a real breakthrough. As Steinberg remarked at a press conference earlier this month, it is&quot;the first time in the country that the issues of land use, transportation, housing and climate change have been brought together in a comprehensive piece of legislation.&quot;... Opponents of SB 375 include some business groups and Republicans in the Legislature -- among them Assembly Minority Leader Mike Villines, R-Clovis. They argue it will reduce consumer choices in housing and local control. But eight Republicans joined the majority Democrats to pass the bill in the Assembly, 49-22, making it a truly bipartisan effort. SB 375 is a carefully crafted bill that addresses some of the biggest issues facing California communities. Steinberg should be congratulated for his landmark work, and the governor should sign his bill. 
 Sacramento Bee Foreclosures keep piling up in region...Tony Bizjak http://www.sacbee.com/101/v-print/story/1199017.html New data show Sacramento homeowners continue to take a big hit as the nation&apos;s foreclosure crisis churns through a second difficult summer. One of every 145 households in Sacramento, El Dorado and Placer counties faced foreclosure in July–5,290 properties–according to Realtytrac, Inc. data service, saddling Sacramento with the 11th worst foreclosure rate in the country. Foreclosures nationally were up 55 percent over July of last year, and mortgage experts say they see no letup in the litany of lost houses anytime soon. &quot;There still are a lot of high-risk loans out there at risk for foreclosure,&quot;Daren Blomquist of Realtytrac said.&quot;A lot are resetting in the next few months, which is the trigger that can cause a foreclosure.&quot;... In just 30 days, the federal government will launch its landmark&quot;Hope for Homeowners&quot;mortgage assistance program–$300 billion in refinancing funds to help homeowners get out of risky adjustable loans and into safer 30-year fixed loans... &quot;Unfortunately, the bill isn&apos;t for everybody,&quot;said Ed Cordona of NeighborWorks HomeOwnership Center in Sacramento.    •Homeowners can&apos;t have secondary debt on their home.    •The house payment must represent more than 31 percent of the owner&apos;s monthly income.    •And, perhaps most critically, the owner&apos;s lender has to be willing to agree to participate in the federal program... Lenders may resist renegotiating the loan if the homeowner hasn&apos;t yet missed any monthly payments... Editorial: Who&apos;s old enough to drink? It&apos;s worth debating http://www.sacbee.com/110/v-print/story/1197228.html The debate is as old as beer, and so are the arguments.&quot;If you&apos;re old enough to fight for your country at 18, you&apos;re old enough to drink legally,&quot;proponents of lowering the drinking age insist.&quot;Never!&quot;opponents counter. Lowering the drinking age will increase the number of drunken teenage drivers. Opponents won the debate almost a quarter-century ago when Congress pressured states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 or risk losing state highway funds. All states have done so. Now a coalition of college presidents thinks the country ought to reconsider. More than 100 have signed onto the Amethyst Initiative, calling for a national debate on the national drinking age. Presidents from prestigious institutions including Dartmouth, Duke and Johns Hopkins say the 21-year-old drinking age is not working, that a&quot;a culture of dangerous, clandestine &apos;binge-drinking&apos;…has developed.…&quot; They don&apos;t want to change the law yet. Instead, they call upon elected officials&quot;to support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age.&quot;They are looking for&quot;new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.&quot; It&apos;s impossible not to be sympathetic. In Europe, where drinking is allowed at younger ages, binge drinking is not so common. Could a less rigid approach to alcohol in the United States reduce irresponsible drinking among the young? The college presidents are right. This is a question worth asking, a national debate that&apos;s long overdue. Drinking age at 18? Sacramento State president says no...Ed Fletcher...8-24-08 http://www.sacbee.com/education/v-print/story/1181022.html   Turning 21 is treated as a rite of passage by most Americans. Friends are called to hit a bar, or several, and proceed to get the celebrant smashed. But a growing collection of high-powered academics is challenging the norm–suggesting there is nothing magic about the age 21. To date, 129 college presidents have signed on to the Amethyst Initiative, which seeks to reopen debate on the current legal drinking age. While the list now leans to Eastern schools, with the presidents of Duke University, the University of Maryland, the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and Ohio State University, a handful of California college presidents also have signed on. Closer to home, though, the reaction has been mixed: President Alexander Gonzalez of California State University, Sacramento, rejected the initiative. University of California, Davis, Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef is neutral. &quot;Sacramento State is not taking part in the Amethyst Initiative and does not support lowering the minimum drinking age to 18,&quot;Gonzalez said in an e-mailed statement.&quot;Alcohol consumption is the leading cause of highway fatalities involving teenagers, and keeping the minimum drinking age at 21 will help ensure that more young people are not added to that national tragedy.&quot; Meanwhile, Vanderhoef has asked that the issue be considered among all 10 of the University of California chancellors at an upcoming meeting. Vanderhoef is still gathering information before taking a personal position, a spokesperson said. Backers of the initiative said administrators at the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University are also&quot;considering&quot;signing on. Further north, Paul Zingg, president of California State University, Chico, said he has no interest in lowering the legal drinking age... &quot;What bothers me about the Amethyst Initiative, is it almost strikes me as throwing up our hand and saying, &apos;We can&apos;t do anything about underage drinking,&apos;&quot;Zingg said. &quot;If you push (the legal drinking age) down to 18, you push it into the high schools,&quot;he added. Zingg&apos;s administration has worked hard to change the reputation and psyche of the campus Playboy once said was the nation&apos;s top party school... Behind the Amethyst Initiative is the three-person nonprofit Choose Responsibility. The Vermont-based group insists that the 21-year-old drinking limit encourages overconsumption, often at off-campus private residences... Manteca Bulletin By freeway, by rail, by jet cargo, by sea - Manteca can move goods... Staff reports of the 
 http://www.mantecabulletin.com/main.asp?SectionID=28&amp;SubSectionID=58&amp;ArticleID=59122&amp;TM=51377.04 Manteca is at the heart of a transit hub unsurpassed for moving goods to West Coast markets whether it is by freeway, rail, air, or water.
Manteca&apos;s location along California&apos;s two prime north-south freeways - Interstate 5 and Highway 99- allows trucks to reach markets with more than 40 million consumers within 10 hours.
The cross-country movement of goods loaded on trucks is made efficient by two key truck-to-rail loading facilities.
The Union Pacific Railroad&apos;s truck-to-rail-to-truck (intermodal) station handles more than 1,200 tractor trailers a week at the Lathrop facility located just a mile west of Manteca.
Sante Fe Railroad&apos;s own intermodal facility is eight miles north of Manteca. The proximity of the two intermodal facilities allow the time-efficient shipping of consumer goods to and from key Northern California markets in the Bay Area, Sacramento, and the Central Valley.
Stockton Metro Airport is 10 miles to the north of Manteca. It has established cargo service plus Pacific Rim market connections for perishable items through its unique Farmington Fresh cold storage service. Runway expansions have been put in place to accommodate oversized cargo jets.
The Port of Stockton - dubbed California&apos;s Sunrise Seaport due to how far east it is from the Pacific Ocean - handles cargo ships moving raw construction materials, grain, and consumer goods... San Francisco Chronicle Protected status cold comfort to tortoises...Mike Stark, Associated Press http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/31/MNNN12HLNF.DTL&amp;type=printable It&apos;s been 18 years since the federal government decided to protect the shy, slow-moving Mojave desert tortoise. Despite that step, wildlife officials still don&apos;t know whether it has done any good to stop the tortoise&apos;s widespread decline in the scrubby desert lands of California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. In some places, biologists went looking for desert tortoises only to come up with empty shells, said Roy Averill-Murray, desert tortoise recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Reno. &quot;We know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines,&quot;Averill-Murray said.&quot;From that, it&apos;s probably not too big a leap to think it&apos;s probably at least somewhat true across the board.&quot; The long list of established threats - urbanization, predators, wildfire, disease, human interference and others - isn&apos;t letting up. And that says nothing of the predicted shift toward higher temperatures and less precipitation that could threaten the tortoise&apos;s food supplies. &quot;The biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change,&quot;Averill-Murray said.&quot;That is the wild card for sure.&quot; The agency is now proposing to tweak its plan for recovering tortoises, mainly by focusing on a more coordinated approach between dozens of state, federal and local agencies that control land where the tortoise lives. Wildlife officials are also trying to figure out better ways to monitor recovery progress. That approach is too weak and too vague in the face of ongoing declines, according to Ileene Anderson in the Los Angeles office of the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group. She said the new proposed plan, released as a draft earlier this month, waters down important measures from a 1994 plan meant to reduce the effect of disruptions like grazing or off-road vehicle use. &quot;To me it&apos;s a plan that says they&apos;re going to do more planning,&quot;Anderson said.&quot;There&apos;s no reason to think this is going to make any difference.&quot;... Rainwater collectors work to ease shortages...MALIA WOLLAN...8-30-08 http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/08/30/state/n114429D25.DTL&amp;type=printable Tara Hui climbed under her deck, nudged past a cluster of 55-gallon barrels and a roosting chicken, and pointed to a shiny metal gutter spout. &quot;See that?&quot;she said.&quot;That&apos;s where the rainwater comes in from the roof.&quot; Hui is one of a growing band of people across the country turning to collected rainwater for non-drinking uses like watering plants, flushing toilets and washing laundry. Concern over drought and wasted resources, and stricter water conservation laws have revitalized the practice of capturing rainwater during storms and stockpiling it for use in drier times. A fixture of building design in the Roman empire and in outposts along the American frontier, rainwater harvesting is making a comeback in states including Texas, North Carolina, and California... The average American uses 101 gallons of water a day at home and in the yard. Add in agricultural and industrial water use and that climbs to an average of 1,430 gallons per day per person. Scientists warn that climate change will result in more severe droughts and erratic storms worldwide, and this spring was the driest in California&apos;s 114 years of record-keeping. Extreme drought and abnormally dry conditions persist across large swaths of the country, with states in the West and Southeast hardest hit... This fall, San Francisco will try to recruit more people to hoard the rain. The city will be putting $100,000 toward hosting how-to workshops and offering rebates and discounts on rainwater catchment tanks. In addition to conserving water, these efforts help alleviate the problem of storm runoff. Asphalt-covered roads, sidewalks and parking lots repel storm water, forcing it down storm drains and into creeks rather than allowing it to soak into soil. Big flushes of storm water in water treatment systems can send raw sewage flowing into the ocean. Overloaded streams can cause flooding and damage salmon habitat. Elsewhere, roofs are being used to collect rain from Austin to Seattle... Inside Bay Area County asks Tracy to oppose Delta plan...Mike Martinez, Tri-Valley Herald http://www.insidebayarea.com/search/ci_10345223 TRACY—The San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors has asked the city of Tracy to pass a resolution opposing the Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force recommendations for the Delta. In a letter to Tracy Mayor Brent Ives, the board expressed&quot;numerous and substantial&quot;concerns about the conclusions reached by the task force this year, but mainly focused on three: that the recommendations promote an&quot;isolated or dual conveyance system&quot;or peripheral canal; ignore 100-year-old water rights; and fail to adhere to the state&apos;s water plan. The City Council is expected to discuss the matter at its regular meeting, at 7 p.m. Tuesday in City Hall. &quot;Although an isolated or dual conveyance system in the Delta could potentially provide a higher quality water supply via the Delta Mendota Canal to the City of Tracy, the numerous other concerns outweigh this benefit,&quot;city staff members wrote. According to a staff report, the cities of Lathrop, Ripon, Lodi and Manteca have passed similar resolutions supporting the board... Water users in Southern California say piping fresh water around the Delta would safeguard their water supply while leaving the Delta undisturbed for fish and other species. Northern Californians, who led the previous revolt against such a canal, fear such a system would divert too much water south. Those who farm in the Delta worry their water supply would grow saltier if too much fresh water is diverted... Los Angeles Times Caltrans director not a happy camper over state budget...Steve Hymon http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/bottleneck/2008/08/caltrans-direct.html Caltrans&apos; media office called me Thursday afternoon and asked if I would like to chat with Will Kempton, the director of Caltrans . Sure, I said. I try never to pass up a chance to complain about traffic to public officials. Kempton wanted to talk about the state budget, or the lack of one. He was steamed -- although polite -- about the fact that the Legislature may borrow gasoline tax revenues to help erase the $15-billion budget deficit, setting off a chain reaction of delays for Caltrans road and rail projects. &quot;I sure wish we&apos;d get a budget, it&apos;s as bad as I&apos;ve ever seen it and I&apos;ve been in and around state government for 35 years,&quot;Kempton said.&quot;And it&apos;s certainly not helping us with our transportation&quot;plan. The gist of the problem, Kempton said, is that the California Transportation Commission has approved about $500 million for a variety of projects, and the agency wants to go forward with construction. But they can&apos;t because the Legislature needs to budget the money. Caltrans&apos; media office called me Thursday afternoon and asked if I would like to chat with Will Kempton, the director of Caltrans . Sure, I said. I try never to pass up a chance to complain about traffic to public officials. Kempton wanted to talk about the state budget, or the lack of one. He was steamed -- although polite -- about the fact that the Legislature may borrow gasoline tax revenues to help erase the $15-billion budget deficit, setting off a chain reaction of delays for Caltrans road and rail projects. &quot;I sure wish we&apos;d get a budget, it&apos;s as bad as I&apos;ve ever seen it and I&apos;ve been in and around state government for 35 years,&quot;Kempton said.&quot;And it&apos;s certainly not helping us with our transportation&quot;plan. The gist of the problem, Kempton said, is that the California Transportation Commission has approved about $500 million for a variety of projects, and the agency wants to go forward with construction. But they can&apos;t because the Legislature needs to budget the money. And what if the Legislature decides to suspend Prop 42, the voter-approved initiative to ensure the state gas sales tax is used for transportation needs ? A cascade of delays for those projects, Kempton said. In particular, he said that 20% of next year&apos;s projects would be delayed, 70% of the projects scheduled for 2009-10 would be pushed back and 90% of the 2010-11 projects would be started at a much later date. Among the projects are carpool lanes for the 5 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley and adding tracks to the rail corridor between Commerce and Fullerton. That&apos;s part of the plan to speed up and offer more commuter rail service between Orange County and Los Angeles. &quot;The implications are literally catastrophic for the transportation program,&quot;Kempton added. So I asked him this: It&apos;s hardly news that the Legislature gets stuck hammering out a budget every year, so what about doing something to raise revenues for transportation? And I provided an example. Last weekend I drove to San Francisco on the 5 Freeway. It&apos;s a two-lane road in each direction through most of the San Joaquin Valley despite heavy car and truck traffic. Why not make it a toll road, I asked, as a way to pay to widen it? I&apos;d pay $5 or $10 to not have to sit behind three trucks full of tomatoes. &quot;We have to look at a new way of doing business,&quot;Kempton said.&quot;The bonds&quot;-- Prop 1B, approved by voters in 2006 --&quot;were a significant down-payment on our transportation needs. We have been pressing for the authority for performance-based infrastructure and looking at private investment to get facilities that we need. Those would involve tolling...We&apos;ve not proposed and we&apos;re not particularly interested in taking existing facilities and converting them to toll roads.&quot; Fair enough. In the meantime, the Legislature is headed into Labor Day weekend and there&apos;s no end in sight for a budget. Whether or not the Legislature sees fit to preserve transportation funds for transportation projects remains to be seen. Washington Post Oil Group Joins Alaska in Suing To Overturn Polar Bear Protection...Kari Lydersen http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/30/AR2008083001538_pf.html CHICAGO -- The American Petroleum Institute and four other business groups filed suit Thursday against Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director H. Dale Hall, joining Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin &apos;s administration in trying to reverse the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species. On Aug. 4, the state of Alaska filed a lawsuit opposing the polar bear&apos;s listing, arguing that populations as a whole are stable and that melting sea ice does not pose an imminent threat to their survival. The suit says polar bears have survived warming periods in the past. The federal government has 60 days from the filing date to respond. One of the plaintiff in Thursday&apos;s lawsuit, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), lauded the choice of Palin as the Republican vice presidential nominee for reasons including her advocacy of Alaskan oil and gas exploration, which many fear could be affected by the bear&apos;s protected status. NAM and the petroleum institute were joined in the lawsuit by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the National Mining Association and the American Iron and Steel Institute . They object to what they call the&quot;Alaska Gap&quot;in relation to the special rule the federal government issued in May in conjunction with the polar bear&apos;s protected status. The rule, meant to prevent the polar bear&apos;s status from being used as a tool for imposing greenhouse gas limits, exempts projects in all states except Alaska from undergoing review in relation to emissions. NAM Vice President Keith McCoy said the group sees the rule as unfairly subjecting Alaskan industry to greenhouse gas controls and also opening a back door for greenhouse gas regulation nationwide... The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit, notes that greenhouse gas emissions worldwide contribute to global warming. It says projects in Alaska should not be subject to special scrutiny because of the polar bear&apos;s status. Kassie Siegel , climate program director for the Center for Biological Diversity , which originally petitioned to list the polar bear as an endangered species in 2005, decried the assertion in the Alaska suit that science does not prove polar bear populations are declining. The center is also suing the federal government, seeking to change the polar bear&apos;s official status from&quot;threatened&quot;to&quot;endangered.&quot;... There are now at least four federal lawsuits challenging aspects of the polar bear listing. In addition to the suits filed by Alaska, the industry groups and the Center for Biological Diversity, the trophy-hunting group Safari Club International filed suit opposing a federal ban on importing skins or other&quot;trophies&quot;of polar bears killed in Canada. The lawsuit is American Petroleum Institute et al v. Kempthorne et al .

 8-30-08 Merced Sun-Star Dairyman gets five-star rating by national quality-control organization...CAROL REITER http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/427594.html Tony Machado wanted more than to just be a successful dairyman. He also wanted to be a good steward of the land. Because of his love of the land, Machado opened his dairy to an independent environmental evaluation by the Milk&amp;Dairy Beef Quality Assurance Center in Stratford, Iowa. Machado was recently awarded a five-star rating by the center. Earning five stars is based on a series of self-audits, participation in local education programs and a walk-through of the dairy itself... &quot;Machado went through a process of verification with his veterinarian and his feed manager,&quot;said Colette Johnston, associate director of the center. The program is voluntary, and Johnston said that dairies all over the United States are having their operations inspected. In California, there are more stringent laws governing what dairy owners can and can&apos;t do. J.P. Cativiela, program coordinator for Dairy Cares, an environmental coalition for the dairy industry, said that there is a lot more focus lately on the environment of dairies... Teaching dairy owners to use natural fertilizer like the nutrients in the lagoon instead of chemical fertilizer is not just good for the environment, it&apos;s good for the dairies, too. &quot;We all share the same water resources and the same air resources,&quot;Cativiela said.&quot;A lot of the water in California is underground.&quot; It&apos;s imperative that the underground water resources are not contaminated, he said. And it&apos;s not just the ground that dairy owners are trying to save, it&apos;s the air too. &quot;Everything that a dairy owner does impacts the air,&quot;Cativiela said.&quot;Any type of combustion engine, or even dust from the tractors makes a difference.&quot; Keeping the land that they live on as environmentally sound as possible is the goal of every dairyman. In Machado&apos;s case, his life on a dairy has shown him that he can be good to the land while making a living. &quot;I&apos;m protecting the soil and taking care of the land,&quot;Machado said.&quot;We have pride in doing what we can for the environment and for our animals. Crop dusting: A fading art Industry shrinking as costs of equipment escalate...DENNIS POLLOCK, The Fresno Bee http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/427606.html Bob Gudgel, 77, is grounded now, his crop-dusting days behind him. Gudgel flew his final flights over cropland this spring, forced to give up the controls after 54 years because of macular degeneration in his left eye. But even as the industry shrinks around him -- and the romanticized notion of pilots as barnstormers goes the way of canvas-covered biplanes -- Gudgel has no plans to shut down his operation, Gudgel&apos;s Aero-Ag in Chowchilla. Tucked into a corner of the tiny Chowchilla Municipal Airport, Aero-Ag has younger pilots in training and Gudgel says he believes aerial applications for agriculture will continue. But it&apos;s a new world: Operators are fading as costs of equipment escalate.&quot;It takes a lot of cotton rows to get a million-dollar airplane,&quot;Gudgel says... Ralph Holsclaw, president and owner of Growers Air Service in Woodland, says there has been a lot of consolidation in recent years. His is three businesses combined, he says.&quot;Two competitors went by the wayside,&quot;he says. Ground rigs have evolved as competitors, and when it&apos;s dry as it was this past spring, they may be the preferred option. It can be easier to control drift from the ground, and the rigs can apply material to the undersides of leaves. Charlie Witrado, who owns American West Aviation in Five Points, says he purchased a ground rig business to diversify. Most powdered chemicals have been replaced with liquids as the term&quot;crop duster&quot;fell out of fashion. And the number of pilots who apply agricultural materials has declined... Local colleges appear to benefit from state&apos;s sour economy...DANIELLE GAINES http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/427578.html There are more students strolling around town than ever before this fall. UC Merced and Merced College are both experiencing record enrollments at a time when stories about growth are mostly negative in Merced County. At Merced College, there is a 10 percent increase in the number of full-time students. &quot;Across the country and the state as the economy has taken a downturn, many people have come back to community colleges,&quot;Merced College President Benjamin Duran said.&quot;Starting last year we have seen a surge that has taken us to an enrollment that is over 10,000.&quot; And after some disappointing years, UC Merced is attracting more transfer students and high school graduates than ever Continued growth Merced College has seen a steady increase in enrollments for two years... When the college surpassed 10,000 full-time students, it officially became labeled as a medium-sized college. That occurred in the spring semester of last year and led to $1 million in official state funding. A buzz about campus UC Merced is also celebrating increases in student interest... Of the 2,956 institutions California test-takers sent their scores to, UC Merced ranks 22...  UC Merced dining hall gets even greener...DANIELLE GAINES http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/427613.html UC Merced students can now watch their food grow, and eat it too. This week, the college unveiled a new, landscaped terrace at the Yablokoff-Wallace Dining Center on campus. The terrace features a culinary herb garden where dining center chefs can pick rosemary, lavendar, basil, thyme and mint, among other things. &quot;We felt the dining terrace and herb garden were a natural complement to the dining center,&quot;said Elizabeth Wallace, who funded the terrace and garden through a donation with her husband Joel...

For students taking their food to go, eco-friendly recyclable containers are available... Our View: At last, a plan for the bypass After waiting 40 years, work in three phases will start to run Highway 152 around Los Banos. http://www.mercedsunstar.com/177/story/427605.html So, Los Banos is going ahead with a 10-mile freeway bypass that will put the much traveled Highway 152 around that busy eastern Merced County city. Plans for the bypass have been around for more than 40 years. But finding funding for the project has always been a problem. The team of agencies looking into the bypass has finally come up with a plan they think will work: Breaking the $450 million project into three phases... Highway 152 for many has been a popular route for truck drivers and commuters crossing the Valley from Highway 99 to Interstate 5 and over the Pacheco Pass into Gilroy and southern Santa Clara County. The Pacheco Pass has been upgraded over the last few years to the Highway 156 turnoff to Hollister where a flyover is being built to smooth out traffic flow. Also, if Proposition 1A is passed in November, it looks like the Pacheco Pass may be the eventual route for high-speed rail into the Bay Area. This plan for the Los Banos bypass by breaking it into three pieces could drive up the cost by the time it is finally completed. Each year the project is delayed will add $5 million to $10 million to the costs, experts say. But it will provide a lot of construction jobs that the Valley needs. Also, that section of 152 has been the site of many accidents, including fatalities, over the years. The growth of Los Banos has only worsened the problem. With a start date of 2013, the bypass should quickly start easing the congestion because the phases will be opened as soon as they are built. Most jurisdictions in the county have approved increases in transportation impact fees that developers pay to fund the bypass. There is really no downside to the Los Banos bypass. Let&apos;s get going. Fresno Bee Builder files for Chapter 11 plan Woodside Homes has subdivisions in Fresno area, South Valley...Sanford Nax http://www.fresnobee.com/business/story/832442.html The worst home-building climate in decades is buffeting another developer, forcing Woodside Homes into bankruptcy court in Riverside. The company, with headquarters in Salt Lake City, has subdivisions throughout California, including three in Fresno and Clovis and five in Visalia and Tulare. A group of five insurance companies holding more than $155 million in notes filed an involuntary petition, asking a judge to force the builder into bankruptcy. Instead, Woodside agreed on Wednesday to file a Chapter 11 reorganization petition by Sept. 16. In the interim, the company agreed to operate in a normal manner without making any large transactions or selling any assets, said Jennifer Mercer, a company spokeswoman. She said creditors wanted a structured reorganization and weren&apos;t seeking to put Woodside, which has 500 employees, out of business. The company is listed in BigBuilderOnline as one of the top 10 private builders in the nation... Woodside is the latest builder to fall on hard times. Lafferty Homes of San Ramon and Dunmore Homes of Roseville left the Fresno marketplace, and Beazer Homes of Atlanta said it will stop building here Sept. 30. Statewide, builders are constructing a record-low number of homes in the midst of a deteriorating economy and a huge inventory of foreclosures. &quot;It is challenging for any builders operating in this climate,&quot;said John Mahoney, who heads the Real Estate Institute at California State University, Fresno. &quot;Home builders who are well-positioned with liquidity will be the ones to survive this downturn.&quot; Sacramento Bee Spawning salmon traumatized by fishing technique...Matt Weiser http://www.sacbee.com/101/v-print/story/1197426.html Fishermen are targeting salmon returning to spawn in the American River and other Central Valley streams, despite a virtual ban on all salmon fishing this year. Even worse, some anglers are using a technique called&quot;flossing,&quot;intended to hook salmon in the body, fin or face. The method is considered unethical by many fishermen. It appears to slip through a loophole in regulations designed to protect salmon. &quot;They&apos;re traumatizing these big fish,&quot;said Alan Weingarten, a state Department of Fish and Game warden who has observed the practice on the American River. He said flossing is also happening on the Feather, Yuba and Sacramento rivers. Flossing is generally done for sport; most fish are returned to the river. Yet game regulators are upset that salmon are being harassed... Rules adopted in May ban anglers from keeping salmon from Central Valley rivers. The unprecedented emergency rules followed predictions of the worst salmon run in history this fall. Commercial and recreational salmon fishing at sea are also banned. However, officials did not ban catch-and-release salmon fishing. They urged anglers in a July 2 press release to&quot;use a very conservative approach&quot;and&quot;refrain from any catch-and-release fishing that specifically targets salmon.&quot;... ...Salmon don&apos;t eat during their spawning run, but constantly open and close their mouths while parked, to breathe and clean their gills. Flossing is designed to take advantage of this behavior:... &quot;If the practice continues…the harassment will cause some problems for the spawning family (of fish),&quot;said Larry Barnes, tackle manager at Elkhorn Outdoor Sports... He said it is difficult to regulate because anglers can say they&apos;re not going after salmon... Studies have shown that routine catch-and-release fishing in the ocean kills about 15 percent of salmon caught. A similar estimate for in-river fishing has yet to be developed... Stockton Record General Plan lawsuit settlement draws specific criticism Lively discussion precedes vote to postpone decision...David Siders http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080830/A_NEWS/808300312 STOCKTON - It was a rare scene Tuesday when, during consideration of Stockton&apos;s landmark General Plan, it was builders and developers, not environmentalists and slow-growth activists, who fidgeted in their seats at City Hall, jaws agape and eyes rolled. The City Council was meeting to consider settling a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club in a bid to undo the plan. The club said the General Plan&apos;s call for subdivisions at the city limits and for Stockton&apos;s population to about double by 2035 blessed sprawl and would harm the environment and the economic standing of downtown. And California Attorney General Jerry Brown, similarly concerned, had threatened to join the environmentalists in court. Stockton Mayor Ed Chavez opened the hearing by recounting his first meeting with Brown in March in Sacramento. &quot;The three of us, the city manager, the city attorney and I, went up and met with the attorney general,&quot;he said.&quot;And I will share with you, as I&apos;ve shared with others before, that that first meeting was not encouraging. He had our General Plan map laid out on his conference room table. He looked at it and he looked at us and he said, &apos;This map is bad.&apos;&quot; That meeting was followed by more meetings between City Manager Gordon Palmer and City Attorney Ren Nosky, and Brown and his staff, the two sides negotiating for months before making public on Aug. 22 terms of a proposed deal. It would require the council to consider a number of environmental protections, among them reducing greenhouse gas emissions, forcing construction of new homes to meet green building standards and amending the General Plan to ensure suburban growth is not&quot;out of balance&quot;with infill development. On Tuesday, Palmer and Nosky were recommending the deal. Developers and builders opposed it, saying the provisions were too burdensome and impractical, or were at least too uncertain to act on that night. They had lobbied council members over the weekend and early last week to put off the settlement&apos;s adoption to afford time for review. But Chavez forced the matter to a hearing. He supported the proposal, saying it would both allow for growth and help make Stockton green. One of the first to speak in opposition was attorney Steve Herum, who represented A.G. Spanos Cos., one of the city&apos;s largest and most influential developers. &quot;The first point is that I would respectfully ask on behalf of my clients that this matter be continued,&quot;said Herum, who also was representing the Martin Dairy and the Committee for Jobs, a committee he said was formed to address the matter at hand.&quot;Issues of due process and fairness require us to take more time on this.&quot; The terms of the proposed settlement had only been made public Friday, Herum said. Second, he said, the settlement would not end litigation over the General Plan. A lawsuit by the Morada Area Association, a group of east San Joaquin County residents, remains in court. &quot;This would be different - it would be San Bernardino (San Bernardino County settled a dispute with Brown over its General Plan last year) - if indeed it made all the land-use challenges to the General Plan go away,&quot;he said. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t. You&apos;re buying a pig in a poke.&quot; The city would gain little by settling and has no reason to&quot;run scared from the attorney general,&quot;he said.&quot;With all due respect to the attorney general, let&apos;s not forget he did flunk the bar the first time he took it.&quot; Third, Herum said, the settlement would undo five years of work. City staff said in December, when the council adopted the General Plan, that the document was legally sound, and officials have said as much since. Nothing has changed, he said. &quot;If I were a client, I would be very unhappy about having my attorney and my staff advise me one way, you make a decision and then months later they turn around and say, &apos;No, it&apos;s really something else,&apos;&quot;he said.&quot;That&apos;s not the way it&apos;s supposed to work.&quot; Reasons to delay And then he went nuclear. Not only would provisions of the proposed settlement have a&quot;chilling effect&quot;on business and increase the cost of housing, but they also would cause a&quot;chain of events that&apos;s going to lead to urban decay,&quot;destroy neighborhoods and debilitate attempts to solve high unemployment and low high school graduation rates, he said... &quot;What this agreement does is create a new policy in the city of Stockton, which is that all of our efforts will be directed to that downtown area, and if you&apos;re south of Charter you don&apos;t count, even though your needs may be as great, if not greater, than the downtown area,&quot;Herum said... Predictably, he had set Councilwoman Susan Eggman off. She tapped her finger on the dais and said the settlement would not undo the General Plan, only add&quot;concrete policies that will actually put some teeth into the fluffy language we had.&quot; Furthermore, said Eggman, who cast the dissenting vote in the council&apos;s 6-1 adoption of the plan last year,&quot;The things you&apos;re trying to say to scare council member Nabors about south Stockton just is not true.&quot;Infill housing, she said, would be spread across the city, not just downtown. Favoring the settlement Those who filled council chambers Tuesday were mostly of that mindset. On the other side - in favor of the settlement&apos;s adoption - were the Downtown Stockton Alliance, the Sierra Club and a representative of Brown. The questions raised by developers and builders would be addressed when the council considered implementing specific provisions of the settlement, not the settlement itself, they said... Postponing the vote ...The council voted 4-2 to defer the matter until its next meeting, Sept. 9. Chavez and Eggman dissented. Councilman Steve Bestolarides was absent. State plans to audit Delta bond spending...The Record http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080830/A_NEWS/808300317 SACRAMENTO - The state Controller&apos;s Office announced Friday that it will conduct an audit of San Joaquin Delta College&apos;s management of $250 million in voter-approved bond money. The audit was requested by state Sen. Michael Machado, D-Linden. In a letter to Delta administrators, Jeffrey Brownfield, chief of the Controller&apos;s Office Division of Audits, said he would examine whether bond proceeds were properly managed and spent, among other things. Delta trustees were told in June that they must cut $62.5 million worth of projects that were to have been funded by the 2004 Measure L bond. A satellite campus in Mountain House has been scaled back, and officials are considering significantly altering a proposed campus in Lodi, because there&apos;s not enough money left. Among other problems, the San Joaquin County civil grand jury reported in June that Delta trustees squandered millions when they decided to build that south county campus in Mountain House rather than Tracy. The college has blamed past consultants for underestimating the cost of a number of bond-funded construction projects. Inside Bay Area Delta College board under more scrutiny...Mike Martinez, Tri-Valley Herald...8-29-08 http://www.insidebayarea.com/trivalleyherald/ci_10338035 STOCKTON—It appears the San Joaquin Delta College Board of Trustees isn&apos;t out from under the microscope just yet. State Controller John Chiang&apos;s office is preparing to audit the board at the request of state Sen. Michael Machado, D-Linden. In a letter dated Friday, the college&apos;s vice president of business services was informed about a review of bond-money expenditures relating to the San Joaquin Delta College Facilities Master Plan... According to the letter, the primary objectives of the audit are to determine: ·  Whether Proposition 1D, the Measure L Bond Program, and other funding sources were properly and legally spent; ·  Whether bond proceeds and interest were accounted for properly, and not used to fund unauthorized projects; and ·  Whether the college adequately managed and monitored the bond programs and bond project managers... The audit team is also expected to examine the causes of any shortfalls and why costs exceeded budgeted amounts and if any projects were cancelled or delayed as a result of overspending. The audit is expected to begin Thursday. The announcement comes a little more than two weeks after Machado called for a review of the board. &quot;Delta Community College Trustees have disappointed the public,&apos;&apos; Machado said in a prepared statement.&quot;The people deserve to know how the bond money was spent and this fiscal audit by Controller Chiang will provide that information and so we can resolve the issues and move forward with the much needed educational facilities.&apos;&apos; The college is still bruised from a critical grand jury report... The board was crafting a response to the civil grand jury report claiming it wasted millions of taxpayer dollars and violated open government laws by discussing closed-session matters outside its meetings. On Tuesday, it sent the response back to staff for some&quot;fine-tuning&apos;&apos; of the language before forwarding the document to the presiding judge. According to the grand jury report, which was released in June, at a closed-session board meeting on Feb. 9, 2006, the college&apos;s attorney and administrative team said a developer would be missing the deadline for delivery of letters of credit, resulting in a breach of contract. The board then discussed returning to a deal offered by the city of Tracy to put the campus on the corner of 11th Street and Chrisman Road. The day after the closed-session meeting, the report says, phone calls and a faxed letter indicated that one or more board members had relayed confidential information about the breach-of-contract&apos; discussion to the developer, Gerry Kamilos, and his consultant, Dean Andal, the Republican nominee for the 11th Congressional District seat in November. Andal has denied receiving any closed-session information despite detailed journal entries from one board member saying Andal called him the night of the meeting. Two months later, on April 12, Kamilos donated $500 to Trustee Dan Parises&apos; campaign for San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors, according to campaign finance reports. At their regular meeting two weeks ago, board members and the public wanted someone to identify themselves as the source of the leak, but no one did. San Diego Union-Tribune Reservoir&apos;s renovation San Diego, water agency officials work to resolve concerns...Michele Clock http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080830-9999-1m30vicente.html A massive project to increase water storage at East County&apos;s San Vicente Reservoir has taken on added importance as the region copes with tightening water supplies. Starting Tuesday, the reservoir will close to the public for up to nine years so crews can complete what the San Diego County Water Authority is calling the largest dam raise in the country. The reservoir will continue to supply water to San Diego residents during construction, though boaters, wake-boarders and water-skiers will have to find somewhere else to go. San Diego city officials have questioned whether the region will have enough storage during the project and whether plans are adequate for maintaining water quality... The $568 million effort is part of a $1 billion-plus project by the water authority to create new emergency storage and pipeline connections if the region&apos;s imported water supply is cut off. When the project is complete, the reservoir will hold enough additional water to supply 40 percent of the county&apos;s population for a year in case of emergency or drought. The reservoir&apos;s capacity will more than double. In the meantime, the reservoir&apos;s water level will drop to about half-full so crews can raise the dam from 220 to 337 feet... San Diego&apos;s water supplies are already tight. Mayor Jerry Sanders last month declared a water emergency due in part to historic dry conditions in the areas from which San Diego imports its water, such as the Colorado River basin and Northern California. Since the beginning of this year, the region has seen a 30 percent cut in agricultural water supplies. Depending on pumping restrictions and this winter&apos;s rain and snowfall, the region may face further reductions and even mandatory water restrictions as early as spring, said John Liarakos, a spokesman for the water authority... T he heart of the San Vicente project–placing concrete for the bigger dam–is expected to take about seven months. But with a list of other tasks including building a new marina and refilling the reservoir, the project could take until 2017, water authority officials said...

 8-29-08 Merced Sun-Star G Street underpass at train tracks and Campus Parkway get millions in funding...SCOTT JASON http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/425415.html ...The California Transportation Commission approved a $9 million award for the city that will pay half the cost to build a railroad underpass at G Street. The rest of the construction will be funded by the Redevelopment Agency, impact fees paid by developers and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. The state commission also OK&apos;d $12 million for the Campus Parkway, which will connect Highway 99 to Yosemite Avenue. The first phase, funded by the award, will go from the Mission Avenue interchange to Childs Avenue. The money depends on the state passing a 2008-2009 budget... Both awards are victories for the county, city and university, which lobbied hard for the funding. The projects will ease traffic congestion, make trips to the burgeoning campus quicker and encourage more growth. The underpass, set to break ground by early 2010 and finish in the fall of 2011... The Campus Parkway project will probably go to bid in November, and construction will start in March, county spokesman Mark Hendrickson said. Trial of UC Merced grad student accused of making meth delayed Investigators say he stole from school and tried to produce a superdrug....VICTOR A. PATTON 
 http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/425401.html A UC Merced grad student accused of stealing equipment and chemicals from a university lab to make methamphetamine made an in-person appearance in court Thursday. Dressed in a gray jailhouse jumpsuit, 36-year-old Jason West stood briefly in Merced Superior Court for a preliminary hearing in his case. Commissioner Ralph Cook then rescheduled West&apos;s hearing to Sept. 11 to allow defense attorney William Davis more time to review reports in the case. West was arrested earlier this month at his home... Merced County sheriff&apos;s investigators said that he had stolen more than $10,000 in chemicals and equipment from UC Merced. The investigation revealed that he improved on a 30-year-old method of making the drug that avoids using ephedrine or pseudoephedrine -- chemicals which are under federal regulation, according to investigators. The regulations help investigators track the people making meth. West remains in jail in lieu of $1,045,000 bail. Legislature approves metal theft bill...E.J. SCHULTZ, The Fresno Bee http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/425407.html SACRAMENTO -- Ending two years of debate, the Legislature on Thursday gave final approval to a bill aimed at stopping metal theft, a growing problem in the Valley and elsewhere. Metal theft is an especially troublesome crime in rural areas... Assembly Bill 844 requires junk dealers and recyclers to collect more information from customers that could help with investigations, including thumbprints and photos of the metals being recycled. Also, customers would not get cash payments until three days after they sell the metals. Irregular customers could only be paid by check. The Assembly approved AB 844 with a unanimous vote. Gov. Schwarzenegger is expected to sign the bill, though he has vowed to ignore most bills until lawmakers reach a deal on the state budget, now 60 days late. Assembly Member Tom Berryhill, R-Modesto, has been pushing the bill since last year. His goal was to ensure the bill did not override existing -- and in some cases tougher -- rules already in place in several counties. Recyclers resisted, fearing the proposal would open the door for local ordinances that they said would be tough to comply with. A compromise was reached allowing local governments to enact stronger ordinances, but only if two-thirds of a board of supervisors or city council agree... Letter: How to clean up air...KARA MIDDLEBROOKS, Merced http://www.mercedsunstar.com/180/story/425422.html Editor: Amidst our budget woes, there is still a way the governor can help clean up the Valley&apos;s air for free. A year ago. the legislature passed Senate Bill 719 allowing the governor to appoint a physician and scientist to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District board. In April, he appointed Fresno cardiologist Dr. John Telles but has yet to fill the post for the scientist seat. This voice is critical to the passage of smart policies aimed at reducing air pollution that causes one in five Valley children to carry asthma inhalers with them to school. I know there are several great minds at UC Merced who would qualify for this seat. It would be a wonderful use of resources to tap someone from our newest University of California as well as allow Merced&apos;s voice to be at the table. Letter: Supports Wal-Mart...HENRY XIONG, Merced http://www.mercedsunstar.com/180/story/425418.html Editor: As a resident of Merced for six years, I have known so many people who have lost their job and their home. Currently, the housing crisis, the cost of gas, food and high unemployment rate are the major problems for Merced residents. In order to resolve this issue, we need more employers and more jobs. So I encourage every resident to support the Wal-Mart distribution center that will bring jobs, economic benefits, tax revenue, money and growth for the county and other future employers. The City Council should support the distribution center because jobs and unemployment is the No. 1 issue in Merced, according to Voter/Consumer Research in May 7-8, 2008. In addition, Wal-Mart&apos;s 2007 generation truck fleet will have innovative design features that will reduce fuel consumption and idling. Their environmental goals are simple and straightforward: To be supplied 100 percent by renewable energy; to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain their resources and the environment. Modesto Bee Diablo Grande has buyer, but no deal Resort asks 12 days to close agreement...TIM MORAN http://www.modbee.com/local/story/411431.html SACRAMENTO -- Diablo Grande officials have identified a potential buyer, but still have not completed a sale. The buyer is World International LLC, a corporation reportedly formed by partners who are Mexican nationals with broad experience in resort, hotel and industrial development, with properties in Cancún, Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas. Michael Ahrens, an attorney representing the partnership that owns Diablo Grande, revealed the buyer in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Thursday. He asked the court for an additional 12 days to complete a sale agreement and settlement among the creditors. World International offered $21 million for Diablo Grande. ...Four bids were received and World International&apos;s was the highest, Ahrens said. World International&apos;s bid was $5 million less than the minimum bid specified by the Diablo Grande partnership, Ahrens said... Judge Robert S. Bardwil continued to express misgivings about the sale and settlement agreement, which defines how the money from the sale is disbursed among creditors, including an $850,000 pool of money for unsecured creditors. Bardwil said the settlement bypasses the payout process spelled out in bankruptcy codes. The judge said he was concerned about how insiders such as Panoz, Davis and various corporations they control are treated in the settlement. More than $11 million owed to Diablo Grande by insiders is released in the agreement, Bardwil said. &quot;It suggests the settlement is made to the benefit of insiders,&quot;Bardwil said.&quot;The lack of disclosure is strongly suggestive of insiders trying to pull a fast one.&quot;... Ahrens said that wasn&apos;t the case and told the judge the deal came together under intense time pressure with hectic telephone negotiations between the major creditors, the partners and the resort... Attorneys for several creditors pleaded with the judge to accept the sale and settlement, saying the alternative was a Chapter 7 liquidation, with disastrous results for homeowners at the resort. A Chapter 7 likely would result in years of litigation, a government takeover of the water system and continued health issues with water quality, attorneys said. Ahrens said that Diablo Grande was running out of money to operate and needed an additional $900,000 to continue through the end of September. He is negotiating with the partners for the money, he said. Bardwil agreed to continue the hearing until Sept. 9 in Sacramento, so the sale agreement can be made final and the settlement payout issues can be resolved. Diablo Grande, first proposed in 1990, survived numerous lawsuits filed by environmentalists over its water sources and impact on the oak-studded valley. The first golf course opened in June 1996, followed by some estate homes and a winery. The hotel, convention center and spa -- part of Panoz&apos;s original dream -- never developed. Instead, single-family homes sprang up in the center of the development. The second golf course opened in May 1998. Crisis Testimony U.S. House banking committee chief will hold hearing on valley foreclosures...J.N. SBRANTI http://www.modbee.com/business/story/411233.html STOCKTON -- Testimony on how foreclosures are hurting the Northern San Joaquin Valley will be offered during a House Committee on Financial Services&quot;field hearing&quot;Sept. 6 in Stockton. Valley housing experts and community leaders will share their views with members of Congress. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, the committee&apos;s chairman, will attend the event and gather information on behalf of the full 70-member congressional committee. The public is invited to listen to testimony offered during the hearing, which will start at noon in the Stockton Arena, 248 W. Fremont St.... Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced, and Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, asked Frank to hold the hearing in Stockton. San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Merced counties have the highest foreclosure rates in the nation. More than 20,000 homes have been lost to foreclosure in the past year, and the volume of defaults keeps rising. Nearly 12 percent of all mortgages are 90 days or more delinquent in Stanislaus County and more than 15 percent are delinquent in Merced County, according to research firm First American CoreLogic. &quot;This is an incredibly serious problem and getting worse,&quot;Cardoza said.&quot;For us, this is as devastating as Hurricane Katrina. ... If it had happened in one week, the federal government would have sent in Army troops to help us, but it happened over time&quot;so the impact isn&apos;t widely understood. Persuading the Committee on Financial Services, formerly the Banking Committee, to hold a hearing in Stockton is key to raising awareness on how bad the situation has become. &quot;We need to make our plight more high-profile,&quot;Cardoza said. He wants Frank to better understand the region&apos;s fore- closure crisis.&quot;I need someone else to pound the table with me. This hearing is a way to galvanize the attention of Congress as a whole.&quot; The hearing&apos;s formal title is&quot;The Effects of the Foreclosure Crisis on Neighborhoods in California&apos;s Central Valley: Challenges and Solutions.&quot;... Although testimony at the Stockton hearing is by invitation only, Cardoza is encouraging people who have been hurt by foreclosures to write to him by Sept. 5. He said he will submit those letters to the committee, and they will be read by its key staff members. &quot;The individual cases are compelling, dramatic stories,&quot;Cardoza said. Such stories can help document the far-reaching effect of the problem. Letters to Cardoza should be sent to: 137 E. Weber Ave., Stockton, 95202. One conclusion from all the data...J.N. SBRANTI http://www.modbee.com/business/story/411235.html Four sets of housing data were released recently, all of which show how badly the Northern San Joaquin Valley home market is doing. When it comes to home values for existing houses, Merced, San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties are the worst in the nation, according to the government&apos;s Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. That office&apos;s House Price Index, which tracks same-house sales prices and mortgage refinancing over time, calculated that home values dropped 34.5 percent in Merced, 31.7 percent in San Joaquin and 28.5 percent in Stanislaus during the year that ended July 31. By comparison, homes throughout California lost 15.8 percent of their value and U.S. homes lost 1.7 percent. Those who bought homes five or more years ago, however, still are doing OK. Since 2003, the federal office calculates that Stanislaus home values are up 15.2 percent, San Joaquin is up 9.5 percent and Merced is up 8.6 percent. California values rose 34.8 percent and national values rose 41.8 percent in the past five years. A new method for comparing mortgage default rates has been released by First American CoreLogic, a private firm that collects and analyzes mortgage data. In Stanislaus, 11.7 percent of mortgage loans were 90 days or more delinquent this June. The delinquent rate was 15.2 percent in Merced. Compare that to the 4.1 percent loan delinquency rate for the nation as a whole. With so many existing homes losing value or in mortgage default, the region&apos;s home building industry is suffering. New housing building permits have plummeted, according to the Construction Industry Research Board. During the first seven months of 2008, 1,278 building permits were issued in Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced counties. More than seven times that many permits -- 9,202 -- were issued during the same period in 2005, which was the peak of the region&apos;s housing boom. To sell the few homes that have been built during the past year, builders have had to drastically slash prices, new statistics from Hanley Wood Market Intelligence show. The median new home price plunged to $299,990 in Stanislaus this June. That&apos;s a one-year drop of 30.2 percent. Merced prices fell to $279,990, down 12.5 percent, and San Joaquin fell to $328,865, down 29.7 percent. New home prices statewide were $365,000, down 16.5 percent. Bay Area real estate investors get dose of Merced reality...YVONNE HOLT http://www.modbee.com/opinion/community/story/411197.html The duplex across the street went into foreclosure Monday. I met the owner when she bought the building -- a nice woman looking to invest in Merced with the hopes of providing a place for her son to live as he attended Merced College and then transferred to the University of California at Merced. But the transfer fell through and her son moved out. She&apos;s been renting both units to two reliable renters ever since, but many problems have compounded to force this foreclosure. First, she bought the building when the market was at its peak. She paid, I believe, around $390,000 for a duplex in a low-income, high-crime neighborhood. A common friend tried to tell her that she was paying too much, but she was sure that property values would only increase with the growth of UC Merced. My friend and I did the math. The mortgage payment alone would have been more than $3,500 a month. To meet the mortgage, she would have to charge more than $1,500 a month rent. But in this low-income neighborhood, my friend and I knew she could never get such high rents. Average rents for the block had already increased by a few hundred dollars, but had settled at around $900 a month... The owner had a problem with her first tenants... She moved in her son and another tenant, who were good at paying rent -- so long as it was $900 a month... But she had to take a second job to make up the difference in the mortgage payment. Then she took a well-deserved but ill-advised vacation that caused her to miss a mortgage payment. Now the duplex is being auctioned off. Her story is common to many investors in my neighborhood. A swarm of Bay Area people bought duplexes and apartment buildings in anticipation of the new UC Merced growing, and promptly raised rents to meet their mortgage payments. Unfortunately, they didn&apos;t factor in the reality that salaries and wages here in Merced are among the lowest in the region. The apartments down the street are an illustration of poor planning on the part of real estate investors. The minute the owner raised the rents, low-income tenants started moving out... The owner of the building next door has the same problem -- neither can attract higher-income tenants to the neighborhood due to the unfortunate existence of gang activity. ...this unit could end up in foreclosure, too. One unfortunate result of all that investment during the peak market is that it keeps rents high. The owners can&apos;t lower rents as they try to make high mortgage payments. Renters can&apos;t afford them because their incomes are fixed. So the apartments and rentals will remain empty.

UCLA official accuses school of illegal admissions ... The Orange County Register, http://www.ocregister.com http://www.modbee.com/state_wire/story/411164.html A UCLA professor resigned from an admissions committee Thursday, saying he suspects officials are cheating to illegally admit more black students but have blocked access to data that would prove it. Political science professor Tim Groseclose said he was concerned because&quot;applicants often reveal their own race in the essay portion of the application,&quot;according to an Orange County Register story. University officials said admissions evaluators don&apos;t see the names, race or ethnicity of applicants and that they&apos;re following the law. They also said privacy concerns prevent them from giving Groseclose the data he wants. California&apos;s public universities are banned from using race as an admissions criteria, but campus officials have been under intense pressure to increase numbers of black students... Groseclose said there&apos;s&quot;circumstantial evidence to suggest some back door racial preferences are going on.&quot; Groseclose wanted to use statistical analysis to examine whether students were being admitted by race. He asked for 1,000 student files, including essays, with the names removed, which officials refused because of privacy issues. Groseclose said he resigned from the admissions committee because of the&quot;lack of transparency&quot;in the process, but supports offering preferences to recruit and admit more black students. After a furor over black enrollment in 2006, UCLA adopted what officials call an&quot;holistic&quot;admissions system... Yucca Mountain opponents send petition...Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com http://www.modbee.com/state_wire/story/411575.html Opponents to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository have delivered a petition to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The petition urges the nuclear safety agency to reject a Department of Energy application to build the nuclear waste complex 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Sen. Harry Reid initiated the drive earlier this summer with other members of the state&apos;s delegation. His office says the petition had about 4,000 signatures. Energy Department officials are seeking permission to build a below-ground repository and aboveground waste handling complex for 77,000 tons of radioactive spent nuclear fuel from commercial power plants and government-generated nuclear waste. Legislators: Dry up or water supply will...Editorial http://www.modbee.com/opinion/story/411200.html How long have Sacramento&apos;s politicians been arguing over a water bond? A year? A decade? Or does it just feel like forever? As the politicians go round and round without budging, it&apos;s only natural to come full circle. And so we have. A couple of months ago, Gov. Schwarzenegger proposed a $9.3 billion water bond -- his second try for such a bond in two years. On Aug. 15, Assembly Democrats proposed a $9.8 billion water bond, their second try in two years. After looking at the two very similar ideas, it&apos;s clear we&apos;ve been here before. And the same issue that kept our elected officials from getting a bond onto the ballot in 2007 is likely to kill it again in 2008... Now it&apos;s August 2008, and it&apos;s déjàvu all over again. We have competing water bond proposals with very similar elements. The most significant difference is in how to allocate the money. Fresno Assemblyman Juan Arambula is the leading proponent for the Democrats&apos; effort. He says his bill is a good compromise -- except that it isn&apos;t, because it still contains the&quot;annual allocation.&quot; Assemblyman Tom Berryhill, R-Modesto, is leading the charge for the governor&apos;s proposal (originally carried by Sen. Dave Cogdill). Berryhill has guaranteed that not one Republican will vote for a plan that includes annual appropriations because such annual review provides too many&quot;offramps&quot;for the money. So we&apos;re back to the same old debate, and we&apos;re likely to get the same old result. The deadline for putting a water bond on the Nov. 4 ballot probably is Monday. Meanwhile, after two years of drought, cities up and down the state are restricting water use by 10 percent or 20 percent. Arguing over water can be thirsty business. We just hope the politicians&apos; mouths run dry before the state does. Sacramento Bee Water authority wins grant for meters, appliances...Matt Weiser http://www.sacbee.com/101/v-print/story/1195240.html The Regional Water Authority has won a nearly $2 million state grant to help local agencies install water meters and expand rebates for efficient appliances. The California Department of Water Resources grant announced Wednesday is one of 52 totaling $17 million that comes from Proposition 50 passed by voters in 2002. The water authority will make half of its $1.97 million grant available to urban water agencies in the metro area to subsidize water meter installations. Most of the region is unmetered, but state law requires meter installation by 2013 or 2025, depending on water source. Stockton Record Canal foes: Delta promises broken Farmers, anglers say health of estuary neglected...Alex Breitler http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080829/A_NEWS/808290337/-1/A_NEWS The government should keep its promises. So said farmers, anglers and water lawyers who got one last chance Thursday to protest a plan proposing a peripheral canal as the&quot;linchpin&quot;of the state&apos;s future water system. The canal would take water from the Sacramento River near Hood and skirt it around the central Delta to state and federal pumps near Tracy, and from there to farms and cities as far south as San Diego. One problem, critics say: The government historically promised that the Delta&apos;s needs would come first. Only surplus water would be shipped south. &quot;What is currently conveyed to the south is already too much water, and the Delta tells us so,&quot;said Dave Scatena, a fisherman. In Stockton to hear his angst was retired environmental attorney Richard Frank, one of seven members of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force. The team has written a report to be made final by the end of October. That report will go to the governor and help shape legislation next year to tackle the Delta&apos;s numerous problems, at an estimated cost of $12 billion to $24 billion over the next 15 years. While Thursday&apos;s meeting was their last chance to publicly condemn the draft report, canal opponents vowed they would continue to fight. And many are seasoned veterans... Many observers, however, say they feel the whole thing is a done deal. While the report says the environment and water supply should be treated as&quot;co-equals,&quot;and while a canal would be only part of the proposed solution, critics note that the report fails so quantify how much fresh water will be needed to keep the Delta healthy. Indeed, that answer might never be known, according to the report. What the government did know as far back as 20 years is that it would eventually need more water, said Stockton lawyer Dante Nomellini, who represents Delta farmers. Millions of acre-feet of water were supposed to come from rivers on California&apos;s north coast - rivers that were deemed wild and scenic and could not be tapped. Even though that water never materialized, exports from the Delta soared. &quot;You people have bought into this idea of co-equality&quot;of the environment and water supplies, Nomellini told Frank.&quot;That turns upside-down the whole promise ... that the needs of Northern California come first.&quot; Nomellini said he expects a decade-long court battle. Frank said Thursday&apos;s arguments were&quot;well thought out&quot;and that he&apos;d share them with the rest of the task force. &quot;We have absolutely no power&quot;in the ultimate outcome, he said. ...but it will be up to the lawmakers after that. And perhaps the judges. A telling quote...Alex Breitler&apos;s blog http://blogs.recordnet.com/sr-abreitler Opponents of a peripheral canal rest much of their argument upon past promises by the government -- promises that the Delta&apos;s needs would come before those of the water exporters. Consider these words, spoken by Secretary of the Interior Julius Krug on Oct. 12, 1948: &quot;Let me state, clearly and finally, the Interior Department is fully and completely committed to the policy that no water which is needed in the Sacramento Valley will be sent out of it.&quot; Sacramento Valley = Delta, since most of the fresh water flowing into the Delta comes from the Sacramento. Words to ponder for your Friday morning. San Francisco Chronicle Water logjam...Kelly Zito, Village Green http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=50&amp;entry_id=29595 I&apos;ve researched California&apos;s water crisis in lots of different ways: Watching a well drilling rig bore into the ground near a golf tee, listening to a San Leandro couple explain how they collect water&quot;scraps&quot;and standing in a parched almond grove where you could almost hear the leaves shriveling. This week, it was time to travel to another setting -- the one that matters most. Sacramento. On Tuesday (originally it was scheduled for Monday. Go figure!), Assembly members on the special committee on water met to talk about various plans to fix the state&apos;s water supply problems. A few proposals are on the table, and they&apos;re competing for a place on November&apos;s ballot. Gov. Schwarzenegger&apos;s water bond calls for $9.3 billion, more&quot;surface storage&quot;(read: dams and reservoirs) and a specially appointed group to dole out the money. A Republican water bill that came out a day later is similar to Schwarzenegger&apos;s plan, but it totals nearly $10 billion. The Democrats appeared to use the governor&apos;s plan as a template -- with several important differences. Their bond calls for $9.8 billion, leaves appropriation powers with the legislature and earmarks $250 million for water recycling projects. The plan also stipulates no bond money could pay for a peripheral canal -- a 1980s era (leg warmers, synth pop and peripheral canals are so in!) solution to repair the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by funneling water around the estuary. During Tuesday&apos;s information hearing on the Democrats&apos; bond proposal, the two sides alternately seemed close to a compromise plan, and far, far apart. Department of Water Resources chief Lester Snow noted that the differences between the Administration and Democrats comprised a very short list. With the deadline for the November ballot looming and water managers increasingly worried about water stores heading into fall, we may learn within days just how short that list is. Water board sues U.S. over mothball fleet...Kelly Zito http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/BA3R12K9BU.DTL&amp;type=printable A regional water board is readying a lawsuit against the U.S. Maritime Administration claiming federal authorities have allowed toxic chemicals and metals from the mothball fleet to continue to leach into Suisun Bay. The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board contends the 50-plus decrepit ships - some cargo ships dating to World War II - have dumped asbestos, used oil and as much as 19 tons of mercury, lead and copper from their hulls and pose hazards to water quality, commercial and sport fishing, fish migration and endangered species. Unless federal maritime officials halt the pollution discharges in 60 days, the water board plans to file suit in U.S. District Court in Sacramento under the Clean Water Act. Last fall, three environmental organizations sued to force the Maritime Administration to remove the ships from Suisun Bay. That case is winding its way through the federal court in Sacramento and is on track for a September 2009 trial date. Meantime, the ships remain - about 57 considered badly corroded. Despite ongoing complaints, maritime officials said the water board&apos;s move was disappointing and highlights the agency&apos;s rock-and-a-hard-place position in the Bay Area. In essence, the Maritime Administration said it cannot move the ships without first cleaning them, according to a U.S. Coast Guard requirement under the National Invasive Species Act. Cleaning the ships, however, can release more toxic substances into the water, thereby violating the Clean Water Act... Industry groups file lawsuit over polar bear rule...DINA CAPPIELLO, Associated Press Writer http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/08/28/national/w115753D86.DTL&amp;type=printable Five industry groups have sued the Interior Department over a rule to protect the polar bear that they say unfairly singles out business operations in Alaska for their contribution to global warming. Groups representing the oil and gas, mining, and manufacturing industries asked a federal judge Wednesday to ensure that laws designed to protect the bear, which was recently designated a threatened species, are not used to block projects that release heat-trapping gases in the state. The American Petroleum Institute was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Iron and Steel Institute in the lawsuit, which explicitly challenges three words—except in Alaska—that appear in a 62-page rule issued in May. That&apos;s when the polar bear became the first species with a population that the government has classified as threatened by global warming. The bear depends on sea ice, which is expected to melt as temperatures climb, for survival. The Bush administration made clear that it did not want the polar bear&apos;s status to become a tool of environmentalists seeking to regulate the gases blamed for global warming. On the day it announced the polar bear as a threatened species, which bars harm to the bear or its habitat, the administration also issued a special rule limiting the types of projects that could be evaluated. To further block attempts to use endangered species law to control greenhouse gas emissions, it exempted projects in all states but Alaska from undergoing reviews. The groups say the three words—which they refer to as The Alaska Gap—are unlawful and run counter to the administration&apos;s belief that it is impossible to link emissions from a single project to the increasing temperatures that threaten the polar bear... The lawsuit filed Thursday is the latest to target the polar bear. Environmentalists and the state of Alaska have also sued the Interior Department over the polar bear&apos;s protection. In the meantime, energy companies have paid billions for the right to explore for oil and natural gas in polar bear habitat. The Interior Department would not comment on the lawsuit. Brendan Cummings, the oceans program director for the Center for Biological Diversity, which is challenging the rule in court on the grounds that it is illegal, said Thursday that the lawsuit brought by industry is another attempt to&quot;make the polar bear&apos;s protections more meaningless than they already are.&quot; Private management of S.F. golf courses urged...Marisa Lagos http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/BADQ12K9AM.DTL&amp;type=printable San Francisco&apos;s five public golf courses should be operated by private management firms, according to a city-commissioned report that immediately drew heat from opponents of privatization. The report, obtained Thursday by The Chronicle, advises the city to enter 15- to 20-year lease agreements with private management firms, and says that the leases should require the new operators to make much-needed capital improvements to the aging parks and share gross revenues from the courses with the city... The 93-page document found that golf is so popular in the Bay Area that the city&apos;s courses would be profitable if they were improved and marketed properly. But it recommends cutting the 18-hole Lincoln Golf Course to nine holes to allow for other recreational opportunities. The report drew fire from a number of parks advocates, including Nancy Wurfel, who accused the city&apos;s Recreation and Park Department, which oversees the courses, of stacking the deck for privatization. &quot;This is a fait accompli to give away as much public land as possible,&quot;Wurfel said... The city has been struggling for years over how to manage its golf courses, most of which are in need of millions of dollars of repairs and upgrades... Study disappoints some The study was finished in July but not released in its entirety until Wednesday, after several members of the task force in recent weeks submitted public records requests to the park department. The final version was apparently altered after park department employees reviewed a draft... A city wary of privatization The park department did not comment on the complaints, but Supervisor Sean Elsbernd, who agreed with the recommendations, scoffed at the accusation that the report was influenced by the park department... Another task force member, Brent Plater, said the report&apos;s recommendations for Sharp Park Golf Course in Pacifica - restoring the course to its original design - could leave the city open to civil and criminal penalties. The course is located adjacent to a lagoon and is the habitat of an endangered species, the San Francisco garter snake, which is protected under state and federal laws; restoring the original design would jeopardize that species, he said. &quot;The parks department wants to divest themselves of the problem,&quot;by contracting out the management, he said,&quot;but they can&apos;t escape liability for killing an endangered species.&quot;...

A police officer at UC Irvine earned almost $65,000 for extra work. And 60 UC employees made more than $50,000 each in overtime pay during 2007, up from 43 employees the year before. The annual overtime pay throughout the 10-campus UC system rose by 12.4 percent to a total of $135 million. It was shared among 49,218 employees, according to an analysis of UC&apos;s $8.9 billion annual payroll... &quot;We need to monitor all our personnel-related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well,&quot;said UC President Mark Yudof.&quot;At the same time, overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public, such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies, or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff.&quot; The majority of the top 100 overtime earners across the system in 2007 were nurses or other health care workers, such as ultrasound technologists. UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said overtime is often needed when permanent positions are unfilled because of budget constraints, turnover or labor shortages. Overtime is also used to cover the work of employees on vacation or maternity leaves, he said. Among the 10 campuses, UCLA paid out the most overtime, $41.5 million. However, it had 53,228 employees on its payroll - more than any other campus - and it has a major hospital operation...

The court is expected to decide next week whether to lift the injunction preventing the university from beginning construction. If the court decides to hear the appeal, the injunction could be extended for a year or so, attorneys for both sides have said... Keep the drinking age at 21...Robert A. Corrigan, president of San Francisco State University http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/ED5V12JHGR.DTL&amp;type=printable Universities exist to improve lives. Faculty, administrators and staff devote their careers to helping people - many of them young people - to fulfill their promise. Nothing is more difficult for us to bear than the loss of a student, cut down in his or her prime because of an accident, illness or poor choice. And we know, from years of experience, that one major path toward making poor choices is excessive consumption of alcohol. Yes, college is an important time to learn lessons not only about history, science, literature and art, but about life. There simply are some lessons that 18-to-20-year-olds - away from home and parental supervision for the first time in their lives - simply should not have to master: accompanying a classmate to the ER for treatment of an alcohol overdose; waking to a partner in bed and no recollection of what transpired there; grieving for a friend killed in an auto accident where alcohol was involved. If our nation reduces the drinking age from 21 to 18, as a coalition of university leaders has proposed, we will turn our campuses into the wrong kind of learning labs... The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates lowering the drinking age to 18 will increase fatalities by 10 percent. The American Medical Association reports that the brains of adolescents are so vulnerable that even short-term or moderate drinking can impair memory, learning, information recall and socialization - some of the very reasons for which we send our youth to college. We take a strong stand against underage drinking at S.F. State, as do all 23 campuses in the California State University system. Our trustees adopted a comprehensive alcohol policy in 2001 that applies to students of all ages. It is considered the most comprehensive alcohol policy of any university system in the country - and it works. Since the policy was adopted, campuses report a decrease in students driving after consuming alcohol and DUIs; fewer incidents of alcohol-related misconduct; reduced underage drinking and reduced binge drinking... Despite our efforts, and a drinking age of 21, we still have occasions where students drink excessively and make dangerous choices. Consider that half of the sexual assaults reported on our campus last year involved excessive alcohol consumption by victims under 21. Consider that we still witness alcohol overdoses, still break up parties where legal IDs are in short supply, still catch an occasional driver who can&apos;t pass one of college&apos;s most important tests - a sobriety test. A change in federal law that enlarges the pool of college students who can legally drink simply won&apos;t help. Discussing the drinking age The Amethyst Initiative, a proposal to debate lowering the drinking age to 18 from 21, was signed by about 100 college presidents across the country. They say laws encourage binge drinking on college campuses, where alcohol abuse is a problem.

Inside Bay Area Port&apos;s anti-pollution plan falls short, critics say State, regional air boards say they want more specifics...Denis Cuff http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_10327887 The Port of Oakland&apos;s long-awaited proposal to cut diesel air pollution—and the higher cancer risk it brings to neighbors miles away—is inadequate because it lacks details and deadlines, environmental regulators and groups say. The plan has taken on added sensitivity because a state report in March concluded that West Oakland residents face a cancer risk four times higher than the general Bay Area population because of diesel pollution from trucks, ships, railroads and equipment. The port pollution also elevates cancer risks to a much lesser degree in communities miles away in western Alameda and Contra Costa counties, state officials said. In releasing the Maritime Air Quality Improvement Plan last month, port managers said it would cut the elevated cancer risk in West Oakland by 85 percent through a mix of cleaner fuels and vehicles, and installation of pollution filters in vehicles and equipment. The Bay Area and California air pollution boards, however, lead a chorus of groups saying the plan fails to spell out who would do what, by when, to cut pollution—and who would foot the bill. &quot;The draft plan does not provide clear and sufficient commitments to meet the goal, nor does it convey a sense of urgency to do so expeditiously,&quot;said Jack Broadbent, chief executive officer of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.&quot;It needs to be beefed up to assure greater protection of public health.&quot;... Los Angeles Times Assembly Democrats prevail on water bill With three days left in the session, legislators also vote to ban dogs on drivers&apos; laps and put warnings on &apos;alcopops.&apos;...Nancy Vogel http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-legis29-2008aug29,0,2250196,print.story SACRAMENTO—In a heated debate Thursday, Assembly Republicans and Democrats agreed that California needs more reliable water supplies.
But Republicans voted against spending $820 million from voter-approved water bonds because, they said, Democrats had not consulted them and too much of the money was dedicated to studies instead of construction.
&quot;I&apos;m studied out,&quot;said Assemblyman Joel Anderson (R-San Diego).&quot;What my constituents want is brick and mortar.&quot;
But the dominant Democrats overrode Republicans&apos; objections and passed a bill to spend $820 million from four water bonds.
The money would go toward preparing for an earthquake in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, from which most of the state&apos;s drinking and irrigation water is pumped; finding supplies for rural communities with contaminated aquifers; and projects around the state for conservation, recycling and groundwater cleanup. &quot;This is about putting to work money the voters want us to put to work,&quot;said Assemblywoman Lori Saldana (D-San Diego).
With three days remaining to approve or reject bills, the Legislature also acted to ban dogs in drivers&apos; laps, improve patients&apos; access to information on end-of-life care, adjust laws on abandoned newborns and put warning labels on fruity drinks called&quot;alcopops.&quot;

Orange County judge keeps storm-drain runoff standards in place for now An earlier ruling against the rules had frozen them, preventing builders from getting necessary California state permits. A Los Angeles regional board must review the standards...Jean Merl 
 http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-water29-2008aug29,0,7483889,print.story A judge ruled Thursday that water quality standards designed to protect the region&apos;s beaches from polluted storm-drain runoff will remain in place, at least for the time being.
Orange County Superior Court Judge Thierry Patrick Colaw granted a request from a coalition of environmental groups that sought to keep the standards in place while the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board complied with the judge&apos;s order to review its runoff standards.
This summer, Colaw had ruled in favor of a consortium of local inland cities and a building industry association that had filed a lawsuit -- against the state Water Resources Control Board and the local board -- seeking to overturn the regulations.
The local board said the ruling, which applied to most cities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, left regulators without a major tool to deal with storm water runoff into the ocean.
Builders could not get the necessary permits from the state board because the standards had been frozen.
&quot;The court&apos;s decision provides much-needed relief and just in time for our Labor Day celebration,&quot;Francine Diamond, chairwoman of the local board, said Thursday.
David Beckman, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council representing environmentalists, also hailed the ruling. &quot;If you drink water or like to swim in the ocean, today was a very good day,&quot;Beckman said, adding that the environmental groups would still probably appeal the judge&apos;s ruling that the standards be reviewed and modified.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the local board had failed to consider whether the standards could be reasonably met and what economic effect they would have.
The disputed standards were imposed to try to end bacterial contamination at local beaches, some of which are among the most polluted in the state. Pathogens flowing from storm drains into the surf can cause rashes, ear infections and other maladies. Court: US can block mad cow testing...From the Associated Press 
 http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-madcow30-2008aug30,0,4982005,print.story WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration can prohibit meat packers from testing their animals for mad cow disease, a federal appeals court said Friday.
The dispute pits the Agriculture Department, which tests about 1 percent of cows for the potentially deadly disease, against a Kansas meat packer that wants to test all its animals.
Larger meat packers opposed such testing. If Creekstone Farms Premium Beef began advertising that its cows have all been tested, other companies fear they too will have to conduct the expensive tests.
The Bush administration says the low level of testing reflects the rareness of the disease. Mad cow disease has been linked to more than 150 human deaths worldwide, mostly in Great Britain. Only three cases have been reported in the U.S., all involving cows, not humans.
A federal judge ruled last year that Creekstone must be allowed to conduct the test because the Agriculture Department can only regulate disease&quot;treatment.&quot;Since there is no cure for mad cow disease and the test is performed on dead animals, the judge ruled, the test is not a treatment.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned that ruling, saying diagnosis can be considered part of treatment.
&quot;And we owe USDA a considerable degree of deference in its interpretation of the term,&quot;Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote.
The case was sent back to the district court, where Creekstone can make other arguments.

Officials said the number of cases from the nation&apos;s largest epidemic of food-borne illness had slid to non-outbreak levels in early August and there had been no clusters of victims since early July.
The produce industry and its customers felt a prolonged -- and often crippling -- burden lift.
&quot;Unquestionably, we&apos;re relieved,&quot;said Tom Nassif, chief executive of the Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., whose members cultivate about half of the nation&apos;s produce.&quot;But we don&apos;t want this thing swept under the rug. We still have a lot of people out there hurting.&quot;
The industry response is estimated to have cost between $130 million and $250 million, and workers who lost jobs and growers who planted a smaller crop this year will continue to feel the aftershocks.
Several produce executives accused the Food and Drug Administration of running a lengthy, uncertain investigation that shifted suspicion from tomatoes to jalapeno and serrano peppers, shattering consumer confidence.
Infections were first reported in mid-April, leading the FDA to issue a warning against certain tomatoes in early June. By the time the advisory was lifted in mid-July, many retailers had removed all tomatoes from shelves.
Weeks later, the FDA fingered Mexican jalapeno peppers after contaminated samples were found in a victim&apos;s home and a Texas distribution center. Soon after, the agency said it discovered salmonella in a serrano pepper and irrigation water on a Mexican farm. Mexican officials said tests by their investigators cleared the farm as the source. American produce executives griped that at the beginning of the investigation health officials zeroed in too quickly on domestic tomatoes and refused to consider other possible sources. The FDA also shunned offers by produce producers to supply information that could have helped narrow the trace-back, they said. Still, in a conference call with reporters Thursday, federal health officials suggested that there would be no tidy finale to the outbreak drama... Officials also said they could not be sure they had the final or only origin of the outbreak.
 San Diego Union-Tribune Agency seeks changes on bighorn sheep habitat...7:25 a.m. August 29, 2008 
 http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080829-0725-1bo29bighorn.html The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service this week issued its economic analysis of proposed changes to protections for bighorn sheep and announced two public hearings about the issue. The agency might reduce the federally designated“critical habitat”area for the sheep from 815,000 acres to roughly 400,000. It said some of the current land is already protected by other conservation programs or isn&apos;t really critical habitat. Conservationists said the agency&apos;s plan lacks adequate safeguards for the species. Over the next 20 years, the Fish and Wildlife study projects, the revised critical habitat program would cost about $411,000 to manage. To read the analysis, go to www.regulations.gov and search for“bighorn sheep economic analysis.” Hearings on the proposed habitat area will be at 1 and 6 p.m. Sept. 10 at The Living Desert zoo, 47900 Portola Ave., Palm Desert.

Paul Hubka, who was not at the hearing, was placed on three years&apos; probation and ordered to complete 100 hours of community service at any nonprofit agency within six months. San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne said yesterday that the officer will no longer work with canines. San Diego Superior Court Judge Dwayne Moring also ordered Hubka to pay the department $5,000 for the dog. The amount was outlined in a memo issued by Lansdowne and referenced in court... The officer, a 22-year veteran of the department, is accused of leaving the dog in a police cruiser with the windows rolled up on a day when East County temperatures exceeded 100 degrees. Washington Post Calif. farmers use guns, poison to safeguard crops... TRACIE CONE, The Associated Press 
 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082902119_pf.html FRESNO, Calif. -- Farmers in&quot;America&apos;s Salad Bowl&quot;are turning into hunters _ stalking wild pigs, rabbits and deer _ to keep E. coli and other harmful bacteria out of their fields. It&apos;s part of an intense effort to prevent another disaster like the 2006 spinach contamination that killed three people, sickened 200 and cost the industry $80 million in lost sales. The exact source of the contamination was never discovered, but scientists suspect that cattle, feral pigs, or other wildlife may have spread the E. coli by defecating near crops. The pressure to safeguard crops comes from the companies that buy fresh greens. In response, some farmers are taking gun-safety classes to learn how to shoot animals that could carry the bacteria. Others are uprooting native trees and plants and erecting fences to make their land inhospitable to wildlife. Spinach grower Bob Martin has even poisoned ponds with copper sulfate to kill frogs that might get caught in harvesting machinery or carry salmonella on their webbed feet... But some officials have questioned whether such drastic measures are necessary based on limited evidence... Concern over contamination is most pronounced in the Salinas River Valley, where valuable farmland and sensitive wildlife have coexisted for centuries. The lush valley, described in John Steinbeck&apos;s&quot;East of Eden&quot;and nicknamed&quot;America&apos;s Salad Bowl,&quot;grows 60 percent of the nation&apos;s lettuce. The nonprofit Resource Conservation District of Monterey County, which works with landowners to sustain wildlife habitat, surveyed 181 leafy greens growers who manage more than 140,000 acres. The survey showed that more than 30,000 acres had been affected by trapping, poisoning, fencing or removal of natural habitat. The survey also indicated that 32 percent of respondents were convinced by corporate food-safety auditors to remove non-crop vegetation. More than 47 percent had been asked to&quot;remove&quot;wildlife, and 40.7 percent of those surveyed complied. Growers, packers and shippers adopted new food-safety standards last year for farms, including a requirement that farmers establish 30-foot buffers between their fields and grazing land for cattle, which are known carriers of E. coli. The standards acknowledged that wildlife could also carry the bacteria, but they had no requirement for buffers between wildlife habitat and fields. &quot;I think there&apos;s a little brinksmanship going on,&quot;said Hank Giclas of Western Growers, who was part of the committee who wrote the standards. He worries that processors are exceeding the rules to gain a sales advantage without good science... Industry representatives defend their above-and-beyond restrictions. Fresh Express, with 41 percent of the bagged greens market, demands a mile between farm fields and feedlots for cattle instead of the agreement&apos;s recommended 400 feet. The company also requires that a field intruded on by a wild pig be kept idle for two years... Earthbound Farms also exceeds regulations in many areas, especially in seed and water testing and its one-mile requirement between farms and feedlots. But the company views fencing and removal of natural habitat as a counterintuitive last resort. Habitat is what animals want.&quot;If you remove it, they will go into the field,&quot;said Will Daniels, Earthbound&apos;s vice president of quality, food safety and organic integrity. Fresh Express has funded a $2 million study into methods of potential E. coli transmission. Results are due next month. The Western Institute for Food Safety and Security is conducting a separate study funded by the federal government. It plans to analyze carcasses and anal swabs from 7,000 birds, wild pigs, cattle and other animals collected by state officials. Hunters are being asked to turn in deer colons for the research. Officials are also collecting 13,000 soil, water and plant samples in the hope that the study will rule out wildlife as risks and ease buyers&apos; fears. &quot;We have two extraordinary resources in this area: wildlife and our agricultural community,&quot;said Terry Palmassno, a senior wildlife biologist at the California Department of Fish and Game.&quot;It&apos;s our position that you don&apos;t need to destroy one in order to save the other, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re working on doing.&quot; New York Times California Moves on Bill to Curb Sprawl and Emissions...Felicity Barringer http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/29sprawl.html?sq=conservation&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=5&amp;pagewanted=print SAN FRANCISCO— California , known for its far-ranging suburbs and jam-packed traffic, is close to adopting a law intended to slow the increase in emissions of heat-trapping gases by encouraging housing close to job sites, rail lines and bus stops to shorten the time people spend in their cars. The measure, which the State Assembly passed on Monday and awaits final approval by the Senate, would be the nation’s most comprehensive effort to reduce sprawl. It would loosely tie tens of billions of dollars in state and federal transportation subsidies to cities’and counties’compliance with efforts to slow the inexorable increase in driving. The goal is to encourage housing near current development and to reduce commutes to work. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican, has not said whether he will sign the bill. The number of miles driven in California has increased at a rate 50 percent faster than the rate of population growth for the past two decades. Passenger vehicles, which produce about 30 percent of the state’s heat-trapping gases, are the single greatest source of such emissions. The fragile coalition behind the measure includes some longtime antagonists, in particular homebuilders and leading environmental groups in California. Both called the measure historic. “What California is doing for the first time,”said Ed Manning, a lobbyist who represents the state’s 25 largest homebuilding companies,“is planning for housing needs, transportation needs and climate-change needs all at the same time.” Thomas Adams, the board president of California’s League of Conservation Voters, said the changes were“all going to support a development pattern that will help the state meet its climate goals.” The bill yokes three regulatory and permit processes. One focuses on regional planning: how land use should be split among industry, agriculture, homes, open space and commercial centers. Another governs where roads and bridges are built. A third sets out housing needs and responsibilities—for instance, how much affordable housing a community must allow. Under the pending measure, the three regulatory and permit processes must be synchronized to meet new goals, set by the state’s Air Resources Board, to reduce heat-trapping gases. Seventeen regional planning groups from across the state will submit their land-use, transportation and housing plans to the board. If the board rules that a plan will fall short of its emissions targets, then an alternative blueprint for meeting the goals must be developed. Once state approval is granted, or an alternative plan submitted, billions of dollars in state and federal transportation subsidies can be awarded. The law would allow the money to be distributed even if an alternative plan fails to pass muster. State Senator Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat who is sponsoring the bill, said in an interview that he expected the Senate to approve the bill soon... Environmentalists have long blamed profit-driven land-use planning around the country for creating the expansive, sometimes redundant network of roads that have carved up farmland near urban areas. They have also praised regional planners in Portland, Ore., for that city’s clustered growth and pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly communities. The tools Portland planners have used are called urban growth boundaries, efforts to control sprawl by encouraging higher density development within an area and largely prohibiting it outside. These boundaries have gained little traction in California, where developers have seen them as too restrictive and local governments have been jealous of their own planning powers. Sacramento and San Diego have recently tried to build coalitions to support clustered development. Most environmental groups strongly support the pending bill. Among them is the Natural Resources Defense Council , a major force in the development two years ago of the landmark state law to limit heat-trapping emissions from all sectors of the economy. But some groups have expressed reservations, objecting to the relaxation of some existing environmental constraints on developers... Communities that take part in the process will be able to revise their housing plans every eight years instead of five; developers working with a state-approved plan will have to do less extensive environmental reviews of their projects... Because there is no assurance that regions would lose transportation dollars if their plans fail to win state approval, a few environmental groups stayed in a neutral corner. But Mr. Adams, with the League of Conservation Voters, said that“a land-use bill of this magnitude had not been successful since the 1976 passage of the California Coastal Act.”   8-29-08 Department of Water Resources California Water News A daily compilation for DWR personnel of significant news articles and comment … August 29 , 2008   1. Top Item - Assembly Democrats prevail on water bill: With three days left in the session, legislators also vote to ban dogs on drivers&apos; laps and put warnings on &apos;alcopops.&apos; - The Los Angeles Times- 8/29/08 Assembly approves plan to invest in urgent water needs - The California Chronicle- 8/29/08 Canal foes: Delta promises broken: Farmers, anglers say health of estuary neglected - The Stockton Record- 8/29/08 Water bill divides county&apos;s reps: Malfa, Wolk disagree on climate change, effects of analyzing it - The Woodland Daily Democrat- 8/28/08   Assembly Democrats prevail on water bill: With three days left in the session, legislators also vote to ban dogs on drivers&apos; laps and put warnings on &apos;alcopops.&apos; The Los Angeles Times - 8/29/08…By Nancy Vogel, Staff Writer 

In a heated debate Thursday, Assembly Republicans and Democrats agreed that California needs more reliable water supplies.

But Republicans voted against spending $820 million from voter-approved water bonds because, they said, Democrats had not consulted them and too much of the money was dedicated to studies instead of construction.

&quot;I&apos;m studied out,&quot;said Assemblyman Joel Anderson (R-San Diego).&quot;What my constituents want is brick and mortar.&quot;

But the dominant Democrats overrode Republicans&apos; objections and passed a bill to spend $820 million from four water bonds.

The money would go toward preparing for an earthquake in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, from which most of the state&apos;s drinking and irrigation water is pumped; finding supplies for rural communities with contaminated aquifers; and projects around the state for conservation, recycling and groundwater cleanup.

&quot;This is about putting to work money the voters want us to put to work,&quot;said Assemblywoman Lori Saldana (D-San Diego).

With three days remaining to approve or reject bills, the Legislature also acted to ban dogs in drivers&apos; laps, improve patients&apos; access to information on end-of-life care, adjust laws on abandoned newborns and put warning labels on fruity drinks called&quot;alcopops.&quot;

The water measure, SB 1XX by Senate President Don Perata (D-Oakland), passed 43 to 25 and goes next to the Senate for approval of amendments.

Of the $18.5 billion California voters have agreed to borrow since 1996 for water projects, nearly $11 billion has been spent.

The measure to help terminally ill people received final passage in the Assembly on Thursday. It would require doctors and nurses to describe all legal end-of-life options for them, such as hospice care at home and the right to refuse treatment.

Republicans rejected the bill as a&quot;slippery slope&quot;that could encourage a sick person to seek death rather than burden family with their care.

&quot;Life is precious and given by God,&quot;said Assemblyman Ted Gaines (R-Roseville),&quot;so why are we looking for an opportunity to end life early?&quot;

Democratic Assemblywoman Patty Berg of Eureka, author of the measure, AB 2747, said it was&quot;built on a simple premise that better information leads to better outcomes.&quot;The measure passed 42 to 33.

The Assembly also passed bills that would ban people from driving with pets in their arms or on their laps starting next July and require makers of flavored alcoholic drinks -- often packaged to look like lemonade, cola or fruit drinks -- to put the uppercase phrase&quot;Contains Alcohol&quot;on each bottle.

The pet bill, AB 2233 by Assemblyman Bill Maze (R-Visalia), and the&quot;alcopops&quot;bill, AB 346 by Assemblyman Jim Beall Jr. (D-San Jose), have not been sent to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because he has threatened to veto any non-budget bill sent to him before the Legislature approves a spending plan. The budget is 60 days overdue.

Meanwhile, in the state Senate, lawmakers approved a measure that would extend from 72 hours to seven days the period during which a newborn may be safely surrendered to a fire station or hospital with no prosecution for abandonment.

In L.A. County, where parents have a 72-hour amnesty period, four babies have been safely surrendered since January. County supervisors, saying existing law was adequate, opposed the bill.
Still, AB 2262 by Assemblyman Alberto Torrico (D-Newark) passed 33 to 3 and returns to the Assembly for final approval.

Senate Bill 1xx by Senate President pro Tem Don Perata (D-Oakland) appropriates approximately $820 million in funds from bonds including Proposition 84 and Proposition 1E, which voters passed in 2006.

&quot;This week, during a hearing of the Special Committee on Water, Californians from throughout the state whose livelihoods depend on adequate water supply urged the state to step up and take the necessary steps to provide for this state´s water needs. Today, the Assembly responded by passing SB 1xx, which allocates funds desperately needed to provide relief from the current drought, help stabilize the failing Sacramento San Joaquin Bay Delta, and invest in water supply quality and reliability,&quot;said Assemblywoman Lois Wolk (D-Davis), chair of the Assembly´s Water, Parks, and Wildlife Committee and Special Committee on Water, who presented the bill on the Assembly floor.

&quot;This measure is a first step to providing Californians throughout the state with a safe, reliable, long-term water supply. It is essential that we allocate these funds immediately in response to the state´s most urgent needs,&quot;she said.

SB 1xx makes a number of appropriations, most significantly $325 million to help stabilize the Sacramento San Joaquin Bay Delta, which supplies roughly two-thirds of the state with drinking water, and is the heart of California´s water and agricultural system. Funding targeting Delta projects includes:

135 million to the Department of Water Resources for essential emergency preparedness supplies and projects, particularly for projects that protect and improve Delta water quality and drinking water supplies.

100 million to prevent catastrophic failure of Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta levees, consistent with the Delta Vision Strategic Plan. Projects would improve the stability of the Delta levee system, reduce subsidence, and assist in restoring the ecosystem of the Delta—giving priority to projects that improve conditions for Delta smelt and other native fish.

50 million for drinking water intake projects to improve the quality of drinking water supply from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, including projects within Solano County. 
Additional funds allocated by the measure include:

50 million for drinking water systems for small communities;

50.4 million to clean up contaminated groundwater aquifers; and
181 million for integrated regional water management planning and implementation of water projects to help provide Californians long-term, quality, sustainable water supply.

&quot;This bill is the first step to addressing California´s long-term water needs,&quot;said Senator Perata, in a statement issued when the measure was approved Tuesday by the Special Committee on Water.&quot;SB 1XX gets money out the door so water agencies can tackle the most pressing problems, boost supplies, and improve water reliability for all Californians.&quot;

Wolk urged her colleagues to put voter approved funds to immediate use.

&quot;It has been 22 months since voters approved these bonds funds. We need to get this money into our communities where it can do some good,&quot;she said.&quot;This isn´t a partisan issue. It´s not an urban, agricultural, or environmental issue. It´s not a north, south or an east, west issue. This is money for emergency preparedness, for drinking water quality, for groundwater contamination cleanup and other critical projects that water agencies and experts throughout the state have supported and worked very diligently to put to work in communities throughout the state.&quot;

The measure is supported by a broad coalition of water districts, local governments, business, labor and environmental organizations including the Association of California Water Agencies, Solano County Water Agency, California Alliance for Jobs, Nature Conservancy, California Water Association, and Planning and Conservation League. It now goes to the Senate for approval.

This week, the Assembly also plans to take up companion legislation to SB 1xx, AB 7xx by Assemblywoman Wolk. The measure works to prepare the state´s water system for the threats of climate change, by incorporating climate change information into California´s existing water planning efforts.# http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/72556   Canal foes: Delta promises broken: Farmers, anglers say health of estuary neglected The Stockton Record - 8/29/08…By Alex Breitler , Staff Writer   The government should keep its promises.   So said farmers, anglers and water lawyers who got one last chance Thursday to protest a plan proposing a peripheral canal as the&quot;linchpin&quot;of the state&apos;s future water system.   The canal would take water from the Sacramento River near Hood and skirt it around the central Delta to state and federal pumps near Tracy, and from there to farms and cities as far south as San Diego.   One problem, critics say: The government historically promised that the Delta&apos;s needs would come first. Only surplus water would be shipped south.   &quot;What is currently conveyed to the south is already too much water, and the Delta tells us so,&quot;said Dave Scatena, a fisherman.   In Stockton to hear his angst was retired environmental attorney Richard Frank, one of seven members of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force.   The team has written a report to be made final by the end of October. That report will go to the governor and help shape legislation next year to tackle the Delta&apos;s numerous problems, at an estimated cost of $12 billion to $24 billion over the next 15 years.   While Thursday&apos;s meeting was their last chance to publicly condemn the draft report, canal opponents vowed they would continue to fight. And many are seasoned veterans.   Rogene Reynolds, who lives on Roberts Island, brought a blazing red&quot;Stop the Canal&quot;button - a keepsake from the successful 1982 campaign against a similar proposal.   &quot;This is a simple rehash of what we had 30 years ago,&quot;she said.   A Delta Vision spokesman said very little of the report is&quot;in concrete&quot;and that the public comments taken Thursday would help shape the final version.   Many observers, however, say they feel the whole thing is a done deal.   While the report says the environment and water supply should be treated as&quot;co-equals,&quot;and while a canal would be only part of the proposed solution, critics note that the report fails so quantify how much fresh water will be needed to keep the Delta healthy. Indeed, that answer might never be known, according to the report.   What the government did know as far back as 20 years is that it would eventually need more water, said Stockton lawyer Dante Nomellini, who represents Delta farmers.   Millions of acre-feet of water were supposed to come from rivers on California&apos;s north coast - rivers that were deemed wild and scenic and could not be tapped.   Even though that water never materialized, exports from the Delta soared.   &quot;You people have bought into this idea of co-equality&quot;of the environment and water supplies, Nomellini told Frank.&quot;That turns upside-down the whole promise ... that the needs of Northern California come first.&quot;   Nomellini said he expects a decade-long court battle.   Frank said Thursday&apos;s arguments were&quot;well thought out&quot;and that he&apos;d share them with the rest of the task force.   &quot;We have absolutely no power&quot;in the ultimate outcome, he said.&quot;We&apos;ve been asked to hear from folks like you and come up with recommendations,&quot;but it will be up to the lawmakers after that.   And perhaps the judges.# http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080829/A_NEWS/808290337/-1/A_NEWS   Water bill divides county&apos;s reps: Malfa, Wolk disagree on climate change, effects of analyzing it The Woodland Daily Democrat - 8/28/08… By ROBIN HINDERY 
 Yolo County&apos;s two Assembly representatives clashed Tuesday over legislation that seeks to incorporate climate change prevention into state and local water-planning efforts.   The bill, authored by 8th District Assemblywoman Lois Wolk, D-Davis, was approved 8-4 Tuesday by the Assembly Special Committee on Water, of which Wolk is chairwoman.   Assemblyman Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale, whose 2nd District shares Yolo County with Wolk&apos;s district, is also a member of the 12-person committee and voted against the bill, along with the three other Republican members.   The bill would require the state Department of Water Resources, or DWR, to include climate change analysis in all of its water management reports and plans, including surface storage feasibility studies and plans related to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.   After Jan. 1, 2011, the DWR would be prohibited from approving any integrated regional water management grants for plans that do not include such analysis.   To assist local water agencies in sifting through the ever-expanding body of research related to climate change, the DWR would be required to identify the most reliable climate change information.   &quot;This bill will be the first comprehensive statute to begin preparing California to adapt to the climate change threat to California water resources,&quot;the bill summary states.&quot;Those threats include a reduced Sierra Nevada snowpack and prolonged droughts in the Colorado River basin.&quot;   Supporters of the measure assert that water use and conveyance are significant contributors of greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change.   The bill analysis Wolk submitted to the water committee Tuesday cited a 2005 California Energy Commission study that found that water use amounts to 19 percent of California&apos;s total electricity usage.   LaMalfa, who has long said he does not agree with&quot;the global warming theory,&quot;said the bill&apos;s efforts to guard against future environmental threats were both&quot;premature&quot;and&quot;wasteful.&quot;   &quot;This bill is really just a backdoor attempt to hinder the construction of any new surface water storage in California,&quot;he said in a press release Tuesday.&quot;If this bill passes, it will mean that no local water agency will receive any state grant funds unless the agency agrees with the author&apos;s belief in global warming.&quot;   In addition to trying to make future water-planning efforts greener, Wolk&apos;s bill would also fund a study by the DWR examining how existing water recycling and conservation efforts throughout the state have helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   Some opponents of the bill worry that funding for such efforts would come from the state&apos;s overdrawn general fund, but Wolk and other supporters say funding could likely be found elsewhere, such as through Proposition 84, a safe drinking water bond passed in 2006.   The bill now moves to the Assembly floor, where it is scheduled to come up for a vote Thursday, according to Wolk spokeswoman Melissa Jones. The deadline to pass bills for the 2008 Legislative session is currently set for Sunday.# http://www.dailydemocrat.com/news/ci_10325295   2. Supply– Editorial: How dry we are! Let&apos;s act like it, too - The Sacramento Bee- 8/29/08 Perata&apos;s Measure to Improve State&apos;s Water System Passes Assembly Committee - California Political Desk   Editorial: How dry we are! Let&apos;s act like it, too The Sacramento Bee - 8/29/08   The exposed stumps and shoreline of Folsom Lake tell the story this year.   With reservoir levels so low, Californians can&apos;t afford to waste a drop. Conservation has to be part of a multi-pronged strategy to stretch supplies and survive droughts.   To that end, Assemblyman John Laird is trying to pass a bill that would require a 20 percent reduction in urban per-capita water usage by 2020. Cities and counties would have flexibility in how to reach this target, but they could no longer casually water their sidewalks, as occurs almost every day in Sacramento, Los Angeles and other cities.   Laird&apos;s legislation, AB 2175, has passed the Assembly but is in trouble in the Senate. Its survival could depend on two local senators–Mike Machado of Linden and Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento.   Machado, a farmer, has long had his sights on AB 2175. Originally, the bill included a conservation target for agriculture, the largest consumer of water. Machado and other growers objected to this provision, so Laird weakened it to require just&quot;best management practices&quot;for farmers.   Despite that concession, Machado has continued to press for additional amendments. He seems determined to derail the bill.   For his part, Steinberg supports AB 2175 but is wavering on serving as its floor jockey in the Senate. With Folsom ordering mandatory cutbacks and the state facing a water crisis, the incoming Senate president needs to be out in front on this important conservation bill. A 20 percent reduction goal is doable. It shouldn&apos;t need to wait until next year.# http://www.sacbee.com/110/story/1194414.html   Perata&apos;s Measure to Improve State&apos;s Water System Passes Assembly Committee California Political Desk The California Chronicle - 8/28/08   Legislation by Senate President pro Tem Don Perata (D-Oakland) that would fund water storage, reliability and conservation efforts with already approved bond money cleared the Assembly Special Committee on Water.

SB 1XX (Second Extraordinary Session) appropriates $842 million in Proposition 84 and Proposition 1-E dollars that voters passed in 2006. These funds are desperately needed by water agencies to address the current water drought and fire crisis and to provide immediate investments in water supply reliability.

&quot;This bill is the first step to addressing California´s long-term water needs,&quot;Perata said.&quot;SB 1XX gets money out the door immediately so water agencies can tackle the most pressing problems, boost supplies and improve water reliability for all Californians.&quot;

The legislation includes $200 million to help stabilize the Sacramento San Joaquin Bay Delta, the fulcrum of the state´s water supply system. The funding will help prevent catastrophic failure of the Delta´s levees and accommodate pumping restrictions mandated by a federal court ruling.

In addition, SB 1XX provides $100 million to help clean up ground water basins in Southern California that can store more water than the entire volume of Lake Tahoe.

Unless federal maritime officials halt the pollution discharges in 60 days, the water board plans to file suit in U.S. District Court in Sacramento under the Clean Water Act. Last fall, three environmental organizations sued to force the Maritime Administration to remove the ships from Suisun Bay. That case is winding its way through the federal court in Sacramento and is on track for a September 2009 trial date. Meantime, the ships remain - about 57 considered badly corroded. Despite ongoing complaints, maritime officials said the water board&apos;s move was disappointing and highlights the agency&apos;s rock-and-a-hard-place position in the Bay Area. In essence, the Maritime Administration said it cannot move the ships without first cleaning them, according to a U.S. Coast Guard requirement under the National Invasive Species Act. Cleaning the ships, however, can release more toxic substances into the water, thereby violating the Clean Water Act. Public affairs Director Shannon Russell said her agency complied with the water board&apos;s January 2007 request to stop moving ships out of Suisun Bay for fear of water contamination and environmental damage. Working with the water board over the last two years, the federal agency attempted to create technology that would contain up to 90 percent of pollutants discharged from cleaning the ships&apos; hulls. Russell said the water board was not satisfied with the technology. Meanwhile, the Maritime Administration disposed of more than a dozen obsolete and decaying ships from Virginia and Texas, all of which were in better shape than the vessels in Suisun Bay. &quot;Other states have concluded that it is better for the environment to remove these vessels in a timely manner,&quot;Russell said in an interview. But Bruce Wolfe, executive officer of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, said the cleaning technology was less than convincing. More importantly, he said, maritime officials have dragged their feet on painting the ships and removing debris - measures that would help stem the noxious flow of chemicals and metals. Recently, the Maritime Administration offered to move four ships to Mare Island in Vallejo for dismantling, Wolfe said. Still, Wolfe complained that maritime officials are not moving fast enough. &quot;That leaves over 50 ships out there,&quot;Wolfe said.&quot;And there are so many problems it&apos;s obvious they&apos;re going to be there for a while. They need to take aggressive action to maintain those ships.&quot; Wolfe suggested that the ships be sent to dry dock to be patched together and repainted. However, there are concerns that the ships may be too fragile to be raised out of the water.# http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/BA3R12K9BU.DTL   5. Agencies, Programs, People– Editorial Legislators: Dry up or water supply will - The Modesto Bee- 8/28/08 Orange County judge keeps storm-drain runoff standards in place for now: earlier ruling against the rules had frozen them, preventing builders from getting necessary California state permits.

A year? A decade? Or does it just feel like forever?   As the politicians go round and round without budging, it&apos;s only natural to come full circle. And so we have. A couple of months ago, Gov. Schwarzenegger proposed a $9.3 billion water bond -- his second try for such a bond in two years. On Aug. 15, Assembly Democrats proposed a $9.8 billion water bond, their second try in two years.   After looking at the two very similar ideas, it&apos;s clear we&apos;ve been here before. And the same issue that kept our elected officials from getting a bond onto the ballot in 2007 is likely to kill it again in 2008.   In 2007, Schwarzenegger proposed a $9.1 billion water infrastructure package with a down payment on two dams (Temperance Flat near Fresno and Sites Reservoir west of Sacramento), an improved&quot;conveyance&quot;(call it anything except a peripheral canal) and conservation programs. Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, countered with a $6.8 billion proposal, but his figures went up. When they did, the plans became similar in all ways but one: how the money would be allocated.   The governor&apos;s proposal was based on a&quot;continuing&quot;allocation, meaning once projects were approved there would be only regulatory oversight in spending the money. Perata&apos;s proposal required an&quot;annual allocation&quot;by the Legislature, which meant projects would be subject to annual review before the money to build them would be released.   Political principles can be adjusted, but divvying up money allows for no compromise. So the water bond never reached the ballot and Californians never got the opportunity to secure their liquid future.   Now it&apos;s August 2008, and it&apos;s déjàvu all over again. We have competing water bond proposals with very similar elements. The most significant difference is in how to allocate the money.   Fresno Assemblyman Juan Arambula is the leading proponent for the Democrats&apos; effort. He says his bill is a good compromise -- except that it isn&apos;t, because it still contains the&quot;annual allocation.&quot;   Assemblyman Tom Berryhill, R-Modesto, is leading the charge for the governor&apos;s proposal (originally carried by Sen. Dave Cogdill).   Berryhill has guaranteed that not one Republican will vote for a plan that includes annual appropriations because such annual review provides too many&quot;offramps&quot;for the money.   So we&apos;re back to the same old debate, and we&apos;re likely to get the same old result. The deadline for putting a water bond on the Nov. 4 ballot probably is Monday. Meanwhile, after two years of drought, cities up and down the state are restricting water use by 10 percent or 20 percent.   Arguing over water can be thirsty business. We just hope the politicians&apos; mouths run dry before the state does.# http://www.modbee.com/opinion/story/411200.html   Orange County judge keeps storm-drain runoff standards in place for now: earlier ruling against the rules had frozen them, preventing builders from getting necessary California state permits. A Los Angeles regional board must review the standards. The Los Angeles Times- 8/29/08…By Jean Merl, Staff Writer   A judge ruled Thursday that water quality standards designed to protect the region&apos;s beaches from polluted storm-drain runoff will remain in place, at least for the time being.

Orange County Superior Court Judge Thierry Patrick Colaw granted a request from a coalition of environmental groups that sought to keep the standards in place while the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board complied with the judge&apos;s order to review its runoff standards. This summer, Colaw had ruled in favor of a consortium of local inland cities and a building industry association that had filed a lawsuit -- against the state Water Resources Control Board and the local board -- seeking to overturn the regulations.

The local board said the ruling, which applied to most cities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, left regulators without a major tool to deal with storm water runoff into the ocean.

Builders could not get the necessary permits from the state board because the standards had been frozen. &quot;The court&apos;s decision provides much-needed relief and just in time for our Labor Day celebration,&quot;Francine Diamond, chairwoman of the local board, said Thursday.

David Beckman, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council representing environmentalists, also hailed the ruling.

&quot;If you drink water or like to swim in the ocean, today was a very good day,&quot;Beckman said, adding that the environmental groups would still probably appeal the judge&apos;s ruling that the standards be reviewed and modified.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the local board had failed to consider whether the standards could be reasonably met and what economic effect they would have.

The disputed standards were imposed to try to end bacterial contamination at local beaches, some of which are among the most polluted in the state. Pathogens flowing from storm drains into the surf can cause rashes, ear infections and other maladies.# http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-me-water29-2008aug29,0,7708109.story?track=rss   A fearful New Orleans prepares for a potential Hurricane Gustav: The tropical storm is about five days away from possible landfall in Louisiana and is predicted to build to a Category 3 hurricane. Three years after Katrina, the mayor and other politicians are decis The Los Angeles Times - 8/29/08…By Miguel Bustillo, Staff Writer 

NEW ORLEANS—Fear and foreboding gripped this still-mending city Thursday as a potential Category 3 hurricane whirled toward the Gulf Coast on the eve of Hurricane Katrina&apos;s three-year anniversary.

Tropical Storm Gustav, which was lashing Jamaica after Haitian officials said it had killed 51 people there, was still almost five days away from the Crescent City, according to the National Hurricane Center. Projections varied greatly, putting its path anywhere from the Florida panhandle to southeastern Texas by Tuesday.

But Louisiana seemed the most likely place for Gustav to make landfall, and politicians here were acting decisively to prepare for the worst -- a sharp contrast from the response to Katrina, which was widely criticized as disorganized and sluggish. New Orleans avoided a direct hit from Katrina on Aug. 29, 2005, but flooding after it came ashore led to levee breaks that inundated four-fifths of the city, killing more than 1,500 people in Louisiana.

New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin left the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday and announced that he would order a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans if a Category 3 storm got within 60 hours of his city. Meteorologists predict Gustav will swell into a Category 3 hurricane, defined as a storm with winds between 111 mph and 130 mph.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, in my estimation I feel we are ready for this threat,&quot;Nagin said Thursday during a City Hall news conference. He added that he did not expect an evacuation until Saturday.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency, activated the National Guard and triggered a government contract that allowed him to bring up to 700 buses to the hurricane zone to help with evacuations. The rising GOP star also said he was prepared to skip next week&apos;s Republican National Convention, where he is scheduled to speak.

&quot;We have to take this storm seriously,&quot;Jindal said during a news conference in the capital, Baton Rouge. He added that state and federal authorities would ensure no looting occurred following an evacuation.&quot;We want people to know their property will be safe.&quot;

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator R. David Paulison also traveled to Louisiana on Thursday to coordinate disaster response. Chertoff said during a news conference with Jindal that search-and-rescue teams and other emergency personnel were already mobilizing.

Officials&apos; biggest fear by far was a direct hit to New Orleans, where post-Katrina rebuilding remains a work in progress. Roughly two-thirds of the population has returned and countless homeowners have used their savings to fix up their properties. But many homes still lie in disrepair, and the byzantine system of canals, pumps and levees that is supposed to protect the city from flooding remains incomplete.

&quot;Although we have made strong strides in rebuilding our infrastructure, the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an $800-million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems,&quot;Nagin said earlier in a statement.

Tourists nonchalantly strolled through the French Quarter on Thursday afternoon, and restaurants were filled with diners eating shrimp po&apos; boys and catfish almondine as usual. But the city canceled some of the events it had planned for the third anniversary of Katrina, including a jazz funeral, and in neighborhoods hit hard by Katrina locals were apprehensively watching the Weather Channel.

A report published Thursday found that almost half of the deaths from Hurricane Katrina were people 75 or older, and drowning was the leading cause. Elderly residents may have disregarded warnings, feared abandoning their homes to possible looting, or simply didn&apos;t want to leave familiar surroundings, according to the study, which was published online and will appear in the October print edition of the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness.

Everyone was making plans to get out of town this time -- so much so that hotel rooms were already impossible to find in Baton Rouge. Some New Orleanians reported having to search as far as Arkansas to find emergency lodging.

&quot;I&apos;m going to tell you right now -- this time I&apos;ll be going,&quot;said Tom Allen, 46, as he helped rebuild a house on a concrete slab in the Lower 9th Ward, a neighborhood devastated by Katrina that is still largely vacant. Last time, Allen admitted, he thought he could brave it out. He had to rescue his elderly neighbors when floodwaters rose and wound up with thousands of others inside the fetid Louisiana Superdome.

&quot;No use lyin&apos; to you: I&apos;ve got no faith in these levees,&quot;added Allen&apos;s work partner, Leonard Jacobs, 75, who had recently rebuilt his own home in the neighborhood.&quot;We&apos;re in a soup bowl right here.&quot;

The threat of Gustav had already caused oil companies to evacuate more than 1,300 workers from offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, driving the price of crude past $120 a barrel by Thursday afternoon. Another threat, Tropical Storm Hanna, also emerged Thursday, posing a potential threat to the Southeastern U.S.

In Chalmette, a city outside New Orleans in St. Bernard Parish that was also overwhelmed by floodwaters three years ago, neighbors watched Gustav&apos;s motions with squeamish stomachs.

A year ago, much of the area was still empty, and many vowed they would not return. There were still a fair number of damaged homes, including one still shrouded with a big blue roof tarp, but many residents had decided to rebuild after all, discovering that they missed the close-knit world of&quot;Da Parish.&quot;
Lonney Sciortino leaned over his pickup truck, talking to neighbor Frank Lewis about how he was planning to take a gun with him during the evacuation, in case chaos ensued on the highway.

Both thought about boarding up their homes before deciding there was no use. Chalmette&apos;s potential problem, they agreed, would be flooding from failing levees, which is what inundated homes with more than 7 feet of water here after Katrina and after Hurricane Betsy four decades before.

&quot;A lot of people were proud they rebuilt here a few days ago, but right now, it&apos;s a different mood,&quot;said Sciortino, 57, who lamented that his children, who used to live down the street, were now living in Gulfport, Miss., and Abita Springs, La.&quot;If we get hit here one more time, we&apos;re done. Chalmette will be abandoned.&quot;# http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-usgustav29-2008aug29,0,3546049.story?track=ntothtml   Eastern Municipal Water District has own &apos;cop&apos; chasing down water wasters Riverside Press- Enterprise - 8/28/08…By JENNIFER BOWLES   The sun is just rising over the Inland region and Bill Stephens is on his cop beat, chasing down abusers. Water abusers, that is. Perhaps the region&apos;s first and only water cop, he arms himself with a camera looking for over-saturated lawns across a vast area of western Riverside County from Moreno Valley to Murrieta that is served by Perris-based Eastern Municipal Water District.   &quot;I just saw a spot back there,&quot;he said, bringing his van to an abrupt halt. He jumps out to check a broken sprinkler head outside a large commercial facility in Perris. The leaking water drenched the sidewalk and gushed down the curb to the road.   &quot;That&apos;s running pretty good, I&apos;d say a good six to seven gallons per minute,&quot;Stephens said.   Although Stephens scours the region only for runoff outside commercial and industrial complexes, the district&apos;s employees will start looking at residential yards for similar violations starting Monday. Fines beginning at $100 will be assessed if two warnings go unheeded.   &quot;Pretty much anywhere that water leaves the property over the sidewalk and into the gutter, we&apos;re going to look for, taking pictures,&quot;he said.   Bill Stephens, a conservation program specialist with the Eastern Municipal Water District, has additional duties these days. He checks out signs of water runoff at commercial and industrial complexes. After two warnings, a fine will be issued.   In a time of drought and court-ordered restrictions on Northern California water that have reduced deliveries by at least 30 percent, agencies are taking a stronger look at the biggest water hog -- outdoor lawns. Lawns can account for 60 to 80 percent of a home&apos;s total water use.   The $100 fine assessed by Eastern will show up on a customer&apos;s water bill if a third violation occurs within 12 months of the first warning. The fine jumps to $200 and $300 for the fourth and fifth violations, respectively, and never goes beyond $300. People won&apos;t be penalized for runoff if they are washing their cars, the district said.   Like the commercial and industrial offenders, residents will have 14 days to fix the problem.   Stephens takes note of the offense outside the commercial facility, snaps a few photos and, like throwing a dart, tosses down his calling card on the soggy earth: a gray flag that reminds folks to&quot;Use water wisely. Stop runoff.&quot;   &quot;We don&apos;t want to collect the money. We want to get their attention,&quot;Stephens said.   The Water Beat Since November, Stephens has been driving by schools, city parks, warehouses and other commercial properties in Perris, Moreno Valley, Murrieta, San Jacinto or Hemet.   Normally a conservation program specialist for the district, he tracks streams of water cascading over sidewalks and onto streets.   Sometimes the stained asphalt reveals a repeat offender. Other times, he has to crouch below bushes to find the culprit, whether it is a broken sprinkler head or an overactive irrigation system.   &quot;This water is coming from somewhere,&quot;he says as he follows the trail to the front of a housing development. There, water from the sprinklers arcs over patches of browning grass, and instead waters the sidewalk and creates a canal at the bottom of the slope.   Stephens explains that the problem can be as simple as fixing the nozzle.   &quot;It needs to be fine-tuned so you get that curtain of water, and so it picks up the brown spots,&quot;he said.   Other water agencies in the Inland region have talked about the idea of employing a water cop like Stephens but have yet to do it. Still, many Inland water agencies in the last couple of years have promoted drought-resistant plants and efficient sprinkler systems to homeowners as a way to reduce the amount of water used on landscaping.   Considering Hot Lines Dennis Mahr, a spokesman with the Coachella Valley Water District, said desert cities have considered developing joint hot lines that would allow neighbors to report runoff.   At Eastern Municipal, which serves about 660,000 people, the water district has set up an e-mail account for residents to report overwatering. In Long Beach, more than 3,000 reports of overwatering and other water-use violations have been logged in the last year on a city-run hot line, e-mail and Web site, said Ryan Alsop, a spokesman for the Long Beach Water Department. It is part of a major campaign that has helped the coastal city set 10-year record lows in seven of the last 10 months, he said.   Violation Means Letter After a water violation report, the city sends a letter to remind people of the dire water-supply situation, but there is no fine, Alsop said.   Eastern&apos;s board approved the runoff fines for their residential customers in May as part of an update to its overall water-use efficiency plan.   Melanie Nieman, a district spokeswoman, said she hoped that once customers get a warning about runoff, they will call the district to get more information or request a water audit, where a district specialist would help them pinpoint their problem spots inside and outside the home.   She said recommendations may be as simple as turning down the irrigation system to fewer minutes or fewer days of the week.   &quot;It&apos;s something that people can do without sacrificing their quality of life,&quot;she said.   Board member Randy Record, a San Jacinto farmer, said although he voted for the plan, he believes a tiered rate structure that would charge more for those who use more water than allocated would provide a stronger incentive. The district is working on that pricing system, which will start as early as spring.   &quot;I&apos;m going to reiterate to staff that that is the last resort,&quot;Record said of residential fines.   Record said he prefers the program to continuing to scrutinize large public landscaped areas that sit outside commercial and industrial venues. He said he still comes across vast amounts of runoff at a major intersection in San Jacinto, most likely coming from a gas station and a fast-food restaurant.   &quot;Until we get those kind of situations resolved, I don&apos;t want to go after homeowners,&quot;he said.   Still, Record said, he doesn&apos;t think the public understands the depth of the water-supply problem. Water rationing could be in the region&apos;s near future, he said.   &quot;If it doesn&apos;t rain this winter,&quot;he said,&quot;it&apos;s going to be really serious.&quot;# http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_watercop28.47b28b7.html       -------------------------------------------------------------   DWR&apos;s California Water News is distributed to California Department of Water Resources management and staff, for information purposes, by the DWR Public Affairs Office.
