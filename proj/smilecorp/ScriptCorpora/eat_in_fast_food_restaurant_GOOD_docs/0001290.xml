 What&apos;s a best place for a 17 year old to work in?

I’m 17 and I want to start working after school so I’d like some opinions on what stores/places are nice to work for. I’m not looking for things like&quot;Work at a fast food restaurant.&quot;I’m looking for opinions on specific stores. For example, if you work at Mcdonalds, I’d like your opinion on what’s nice about working there and what you don’t like about it and what the pay is per hour.
Can you tell me what the pay is in those stores please?

Dont work at Sears or Dunkin Donuts. Any retail job for the most part will suck because its endless hours of just standing and not alot of buisness, on weekdays. Dunkin Donuts was the worst job ive ever had because there would be a half hour of REALLY busy non stop moving, then hours of nothing going on. However the worst part was that i would go home feeling physically ill because all the grease and just…everything they use to make their donuts sticks to you and makes you feel really gross.

Local‘ma and pa’shops have been the best places to work in my opinion because its laid back, and can actually be fun.

Dunkin paid 8.50 an hour if you have worked at one before and i think…7.50 if you havent. Sears was 7.50 or 7.75. Little places are usually between 7.25-7.75 ( i live in the MA area)

Seek employment at the hottest restaurant in town. Start out busing tables if you have to. Really good money.

Starbucks is a great place to start when you are young. Not only do they pay a living wage, they have flexible schedules and a generous benefits package that is available to even their part time staffers.

In fact, I know a couple of full-time teachers who work part time at Starbucks because the benefits are better than what they get through the state.

They also have wonderful plans to help you pay for college!

Look at working in a Chain Clothing Store, Department Store, Book Store, Cafes

They are nice places to work in, good pay.

First off i can’t tell you what the pay is gonna be simply because I don’t know where your from. If I were seventeen and looking for work I would work at a grocery store or a clothing/shoe shop. You get the best discounts and the best costumer service and retail experience comes from stores like these. They look the most respectable for when your applying for other jobs out there that look and grade hard on those qualifications. My first pick would be a sporting goods store. They usually pay out between 6-7.50 per hour. Stay away from fast food places and stuff like that because you don’t benefit from them when it comes to a better job in the future. Also I would recommend working in a hardware store. You talk about easy money and the usually pay well too. Good Luck!

When I was 17, I worked in a movie theater. I saw free movies, before the films were even scheduled to come out. I made lots of friends, and I identify the times spent at the movie theater, seeing movies after work as one of the highlights of my youth. I was paid 7/hr, but that was six years ago.

Part of me wishes that I would have worked at a job that would help me figure out what I wanted to do for a career. If you are thinking about working in some area of health-care when you grow up, I would try to get a job in the dietary department of a hospital for the evening shift (about 8/hr). If you are thinking about working in business when you grow up, I would try to get a job as a teller in a bank on Saturdays (about 10/hr). Some banks want you to have experience as a cashier first, but they do hire high school students.

I recommend food service in a sit down restaurant. Invaluable experience that can be applied to any future job or career: Team work, social skills, customer relations, public speaking, organization of thought and product, details, dealing with all types of stress, personalities and situations; think on your *censored* and roll with the punches with grace; exposure to a variety of people (who also may be able to offer you you other avenues or ideas); lots of opportunity to learn to see business as business and not to take things too personally and MONEY every work day!
