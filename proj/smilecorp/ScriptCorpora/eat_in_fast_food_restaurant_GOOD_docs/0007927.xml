Cheap Gas and Clean Bathrooms. When on the road, you crave to find a bathroom that will not leave you feeling that youv&apos;e contracted Hep C and Lost Hills is not only Hep C free, but also a great stop on the way from Southern California to Northern California.

I know I&apos;ve done the review under Loves and although Love&apos;s does have cheap gas, I&apos;m going to make a general note about the options you get at this rest stop. You can find a lot of eating options and what was interesting is that Taco Bell had a new menu that rolled out and Lost Hills was one of the first to feature the items. If you are driving on i5, then this definitely should be a scheduled stop until you head on *if you require facilities*.

Despite the reasonable gas prices and great variety of food choices, the customer service rep at the main counter simply doesn&apos;t care if you ever come back. I took up a bottled water, can of beer and chips to the counter and the rep asks me if I need a bag; my environmentally friendly response was &quot;no thanks&quot;. The rep immediately says: &quot; do you want to get a ticket ? &quot;
I don&apos;t know if its illegal to drink the beer that you bought on the premises, even though its a restaurant environment. I guess these reps are just too unhappy about their job and disgruntled about their company.
But, definitely wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone whose expecting any friendly smiles to stop by here......

I love this place. Every time I drive to LA, I stop here to top off. The gas prices are reasonable and there&apos;s a great cold drink/coffee/snack selection. I&apos;ve never encountered someone unfriendly. The only problem I&apos;ve ever had was there being long bathroom lines or long lines at the pump if I managed to poorly time my trip and get stuck in Lost Hills with every traveler on the road.

I always stop here when I&apos;m on Highway 5.  ALWAYS.

Cheapest gas in the middle of no where, clean bathrooms (and many many many stalls, complete with sales ads on the doors), and they sell lotto.  I am definitely a huge fan of this place.  It even has an adjoining Arby&apos;s!

Almost always has the best prices across a major portion of highway 5. I always get in and out quickly, there&apos;s usually no wait for the bathrooms, though I usually hit this stop later in the evening. Store prices are decent. I&apos;m giving 5 stars primarily for their consistently low gas prices.

BTW, I have stopped here at least 5 times per year for a few years.

WOW I have never purchased gas that was so cheap and long lasting! You get more than what you pay for. The bathrooms are really clean and I didn&apos;t feel as though I had to put a bunch of seat covers to use their toilets... haha
I wish they brought Love&apos;s down to the LA area as I would prefer their gas versus Chevron or Shell or maybe even Costco.

This is a nice pit stop.  The prices are lower than other gas stations along Highway 5.  The restrooms are clean.  And the convenience store is well-stocked.

Cheap gas. Fast in and out.  Clean washrooms.  Knocked off a star because they had no lemonade.  I&apos;ll be back on the next trek to LA, but this time I bring my own lemonade.

Love&apos;s is an essential gas up and rest stop on the way from L.A. to points north. And the connected Arby&apos;s has great fries and tasty snack foods to consume with that pent-up highway energy,

Even though I have never seen it the movie the Road makes me think of route 5 to Nor Cal.

Anyways......about the gas station.

Theres like 5/6 pumps here total

Some person decided to leave their car at the pump (or got stabbed going to the bathroom) and EVERYONE was waiting for them to come back.

It took the store over a hour just to ask the person to come to their car.

FAIL. (Please no hate mail Lost Hills yelpers)

On the plus side I did have subway so I can scratch that off  my bookmark list of must try yelp places!

Cheap gas, warm store, clean restrooms...as good as it gets.  At least in the middle of nowhere.

I spend a whole lot of time driving up and down the 5 freeway between NorCal and Los Angeles.  One of the pitfalls of that drive is the sparse nature of the businesses that line the route.  You are lucky to find a gas station and restaurant every 30 or 40 miles.  It is really hit or miss on the price of gas...it will either be cheaper than the big cities or 20 percent more expensive...it just all depends on the exit you take.

That is why I love stopping here at this Love&apos;s.  They have gas that is among the lowest price on the whole drive and the whole location itself is a pleasure to use.  When it was freezing outside the store itself was nice and toasty warm.  Last time I stopped here it was 2am and the person working inside the store greeted me with an enthusiastic &quot;Good morning!&quot;.  The restrooms are wayyyy better than stopping at a nasty public rest stop...they keep them up very well.  There is an Arby&apos;s inside the store and a Jack in the Box right next door so not only can you get gas on the cheap but you can also get some food for your journey.

I highly recommend this as a stop on your drive up or down the 5 freeway.  It is nice to find something so nice while out and about on a long...boring drive.

It&apos;s important to have go to places to stop, stretch your legs, potty and get some refreshments!  Stockton to LA is a haul and not one I enjoy much but it&apos;s nice to know there are a few oasis like places along the way.  Clean, friendly with lots of refreshment choices.

Driving the I-5 isn&apos;t so bad when you know you gotta little bit of LOVE waiting for you along the way. Love&apos;s travel stop in Lost Hills (?) is one of three in California so if you&apos;re in the neighborhood, correction - the middle of nowhere, stop by.

Their &quot;country store&quot; has a vast selection of gizmos and gadgets, most of which are useless to any civilized individual, but the fun factor is definitely a 10 out of 10. I think my last purchase was &quot;The Terror&quot; on DVD for $5 - worth it? Not really. But it was fun!

My only complaint is that they got rid of their old style Love&apos;s coffee mugs, which were practically spill proof. I&apos;ve never seen another mug like it and I lost the top to mine - damn!

Check them out... they&apos;re all over the country too.

I road trip to where I grew up in LA 5 or 6 times a year and I know its time to stop and stretch my legs or get gas if I see that heart in the distance. The gas here is cheap in comparison to everywhere else along the 5. The store has a ridiculous amount of crap that is fun to look like while you&apos;re waiting for your pal to come out of the loo. Straw cowboy hat? Van Halen cd? Plus they always play country music which goes along with the ambiance of being in the middle of nowhere. Clean restroom too... Nice that there is more than one stall for those busy holiday weekends.

This is a truck stop on I-5 where it meets California Route 46 in Lost Hills. There&apos;s a gas station, a large mini-mart, clean restrooms, and an Arby&apos;s fast food restaurant in the same complex. It&apos;s a good place for a pit stop on I-5 near Bakersfield.

Love&apos;s in a chain based out of Oklahoma, so they&apos;re mostly located in the South. They seem to cater to the RV and trucker crowd, so I can see more Californians buying the novelties for their kitsch factor instead of out of a true affinity for Larry the Cable Guy.

I LOVES this place!

They have everything you would need on a road trip, plus some things you don&apos;t need but end up buying anyway. The gas is usually a little cheaper here compared to the surrounding stations, and always a lot cheaper when compared to other stops on i-5. Its always great to stop here, and a comfort that after driving for hours seeing a huge loves sign up in the air.

Plus, a love&apos;s lighter is only like 70 cents!

I used to love coming to this stop for gas and a restroom break.  They usually have pretty cheap gas and clean restrooms.  They also have good deals on drinks and snacks.

However, the last two times I came here, they ring up the wrong price on deals.  This last time I went I bought 2 cokes (where the price tag said 2 for 2.22), but they rung it up as 3 something.  I know it&apos;s a dollar, but they should have given me the correct price.  I told them that the price tag said a certain price, and they responded that it was tax, but I know CRV is only 5 cents per bottle.  They didn&apos;t even go check the price themselves when I told them, and they were very adamant they were correct.  I was pretty pissed at that point, but then one of the clerks pulled out a dollar and said &quot;here you go&quot; very rudely.  At that point I was fuming and just left.

So for restrooms and gas I would give them four stars, but for tricking customers and being impolite employees, I give them 2 stars.

A good stop along the way for gasoline. Whenever I make a road trip up to SF, I will usually stop off here or another gas station on 46 because of their reasonable prices compared to that found in Santa Nella, Buttonwillow, or Coalinga, and Lebec or any other stop for gas along the way... so check them out if you driving up the 5.
