Fast Food People: That &quot;Cup of Ice&quot; Request at Closing Time Can Turn Into A Robbery

 &quot;Cup of ice,&quot; my ass. 
​ Our first professional job, which didn&apos;t last long, was working at a fast-food restaurant. One thing we vividly remember is the absolute heated scorn every employee felt for some schlub coming up at the last moment and demanding to be fed as we were closing and trying to escape burger hell.

So it boggles our mind that Crime Stoppers is on the lookout for a team of robbers who approach fast-food places as they&apos;re locking the doors, asking to buy a cup of ice , and then take out guns and demand money.

 Ice ? Sure, that means less clean-up than ordering two burgers, a fish sandwich, fries and a shake, but you&apos;re letting in last-second losers for ice ?

America, have you lost all sense of fast-food employee slacker customer-hating shame? Is the economy so bad that you are actually trying to help customers?

Kids today. Anyway, here are the details on the suspects, who are suspected in five armed robberies of fast-food restaurants:
 Suspect #1 is described as a black male, 20-25 years of age, 5&apos;08&quot;-5&apos;09&quot;, weighing 150-180 lbs. The suspect was wearing a gray jacket, dark pants, and black tennis shoes.
Suspect #2 is described as a Hispanic male, late teens to early twenties, 5&apos;05&quot;, weighing 160 lbs.

The suspect vehicle is described as a maroon 4-door Buick with tinted windows 

The Buick also has &quot;a neon light around the rear license plate,&quot; because that&apos;s how these guys roll.
