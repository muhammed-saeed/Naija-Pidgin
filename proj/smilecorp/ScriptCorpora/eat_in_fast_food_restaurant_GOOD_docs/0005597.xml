 Reviews for McDonald&apos;s: 5           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING Don&apos;t go there. By A Yahoo! Contributor , 3/21/10 Mcdonalds food is the worst I have ever tasted, the employes who prepare your food there rarely wash their hands. I have seen them wipe things down and then they will go and touch the food, it&apos;s totally disgusting. Their serving plates are disgusting and unsanitary. Don&apos;t even get me started on their Ice cream, they haven&apos;t even cleaned out their machine in months because theyre lazy bastards. My friend who works there actually told me that, he had warned me about the Ice cream there. Plus the managers who work there don&apos;t care about anything they let things slip, they&apos;re all stupid! in my opinoin they could barely keep that reasturaunt organized or even at least clean. DONT EVER GO THERE IT&apos;S THE WORST PLACE EVER&gt; I REPEAT AGAIN DONT EVER GO THERE. Iv&apos;e never seen a Mcdonald&apos;s reasturaunt before like this one. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING Mc Donald&apos;s is Review By A Yahoo! Contributor , 11/10/09 Mcdonald&apos;s service is not the best. There Ice cream cones suck last time Ive gone in there to purchase some dipped cones they were all sticky and the Ice cream and the chocolate was melting all over my hands, they just seem like they didnt put enough effort into making the cones correctly . Not to mention the drive thru teens give you the wrong orders. The front counter people I can say are friendly and do a good job, and they look more concetraed on what there doing than the other teens working by Drive thru. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING Why bother By A Yahoo! Contributor , 4/30/07 I have been going to this McDonalds for about 4 years now. Over the last year or so the service and accuracy has been going down hill fast. If your planning to go here do not expect your order to be accurate, especially if your going through the drive through. My last few orders have been about A1/2 right this includes getting my food in a bag. I get napkins when I ask for them, but dona(TM)t get any if I dona(TM)t specifically ask for some. Oh and try your drink before you drive off nine times out of ten when I ask for Coke, I end up with Diet coke. As far as service, forget it! If youa(TM)re driving through AVOID this place like the plague. There is a very nice McDonalds in Sherwood and another good one in McMinnville. There is almost no reason to visit this place so do yourself a favor and go to another place. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING Can we get a FULL order of fries, Please!?! By Tammy , 7/18/05 I love McDonald&apos;s fries. Sometimes I go there just for them. We rarely go in to the restaurant to eat because it is usually at lunchtime and of course time is limited! I really, really, really wish that there could be a rule that the fries have to be a FULL order and not just half full for a large fry that costs $2.00 now!!! Just had to vent about it because it does no good to say anything to the McDonalds employees. They seem to get a frustrated that you want what you pay for!!! Thanks for listening. T.L.

It&apos;s much cleaner than the old one and the atmosphere inside is very interesting. Their new two lane drive thru is great! Service is always very fast and usually correct. The teenagers that work the drive thru can sometimes be obnoxious in that their more interested in their co-workers than they are in getting your order. But for the most part Mcdonald&apos;s in Newberg is a quick and enjoyable fast food restaurant. PROS: quick service CONS: teenage employees Was this review helpful?
