		Do You Burp After Eating
 
 Burp, burp, burp.

It is right after a sumptuous meal. In some places like... was it ancient Rome?, people burp to show satisfaction of the meal and extend appreciation to the host.

Yet nowadays, people might turn around and stare at you if you burp. I don&apos;t burp. If I burp, that&apos;s because it is out of my control. :P

What about you? Do you burp to tell the world it is a good meal? Do you try to muffle the sound as you burp? Or do you try not to burp at all?

sounds like a bullfrog.i guess i&apos;ll take that as a compliment since i cook the food LOL [scarlet_woman]

 If I do burp it is involuntary. However as a child I had the unusual talent (??) of being the winner in burping challenges when I could force myself to burp over 100 times in the shortest time.lol [whiteheather39]

 I don&apos;t want to burp, but if I eat quickly or too many food ,I always burp. It&apos;s really unpleasant, but I know how to stop it . I usually control my breathing to stop burp. [Icewaterwarm]

 Hi there. Actually there have been a few times, where Ive burped after eating or drinking, with me I think its certaint foods I eat at the time. I&apos;d rather burp it all out then to keep in and end up copping a sore guts. Have a great day... [Nardz13]

 I always burp when we are in the house, I don&apos;t know, I guess I have so much gas in me. I just burp and burp every now and then. But, talking about eating with friends, I will not burp in front of them to show how much I enjoy the food,LOL, There are several ways to let them know and burping for me is not ideal! [checapricorn]

 happyI sometimes burp after I eat a lot. Though I always try to burp when I&apos;m alone, not in public. It is considered rude here, to burp in public. I&apos;m the kind of person who will stare at someone who burps on the table or in front of me. My parents taught me like that. [ucancallmedissy]

 Nope I never burp it is very rare that I do, if I am drinking some Soda I might burp. but I don&apos;t drink much pop. [marciascott]

 Hi lordwarwizard! To be honest with you, as much as I want to burp so I can release the excess air in my stomach and esophagus, I just can&apos;t. It is very rare that I burp and I am very happy when I do. However, if I am in my home and eating alone with my hubby, and all of a sudden, I will be fortunate enough to burp, I will and with so much enthusiasm and no inhibitions at all. haha..But if I am dining out or in a party, I wouldn&apos;t burp with that much enthusiasm. haha..Anyway, those rare times that I burp, no one would even notice because it is very soft and shy! haha..
Take Care and God Bless! Celebrate Life! happy

 we find it funny when we hear people burp and when they burp they say excuse me..i don&apos;t burp after meal..regardless how good my meal is but they say burping is good i don&apos;t know why..i burp when i drink soda because of the acid..family members of mine burp and they try to muffle the sound to make it more funny..when i burp drinking soda i tried to to make it sound loud..i thought it was embarrassing.. [angel_of_charm]

 I&apos;m not much of a burper.. but I think it is funny when we party with some friends, drinking a little beer and some seem to think burping is important as going along with beer drinking! I&apos;m thinking of just one or two funny friends, most of our friends don&apos;t burp at all! I think also, it has to do with how much beer they drink!lol [flowerchilde]
 Not personally. I prefer wine to beer. w00trasp [lordwarwizard] 
 Hello lordwarwizard :)

I am like you in regard to burping. I do not burp unless it is out of my control. When I do loose control and a burp is forthcoming, I will try to muffle the sound of it.

There are, however, times when I wish that I could burp, but alas, I am not able to make myself do so. [Transdisc]
 Yup yup, in today&apos;s times, that seems to be the most polite option. lol [lordwarwizard] 
 If I eat in public, I never seem to burp. If I eat at home, I burp...not that I am trying to. [Yestheypayme2dothis]
 Lol, maybe it is the privacy available issue. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 Sometimes. It all depends on what I eat and where I am eating at. I will burp sometimes if I am at home around my husband and my daughter but if I have company, I will hold my burp or let it out in silence. I do not burp in public places either unless I can do it quietly also. [stephcjh]
 Yup yup, seems only polite and considerate. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I can&apos;t even remember the last time I burped. It seems as if I am unable to burp. You made me come to that realization. I am going to try to burp now. My mom always taught me when I was little that it was rude and un-lady-like to burp at all so I tried to hold in all my burps even when I was alone. I guess it just stuck with me. [leatherandlatex]
 It is a great habit that is now ingrained in you. [lordwarwizard] 
 I burp after eating,and before I ever eat anything. I could be just looking at TV and here it comes. I&apos;ve noticed this a lot lately. [Remmie7]
 sometimes it just comes all of a sudden..no time to prevent it...I dont burp intentionally.They say eating fast causes burping as the gas inside a empty stomach comes up when stomach gets filled by food at a fast rate.....!!! [saverio]
 Time to take it slow when eating then! w00t [lordwarwizard] 
 I consider burping as an appreciation of good food. A burp will do. I burp, but instead of saying &quot;excuse me&quot; I say &quot;thank You.&quot; It is my way of saying thanks to Him for the grace that I received and will be receiving. Burping reminds me of how lucky I am, compared to the less fortunate fellows. [hoswe15]
 LOL, you have reached another stage of body language. rasprasprasp [lordwarwizard] 
 Well, I think burp is a normal things and we shouldn&apos;t avoid to burp it. I burp freely when I eat with family. But I&apos;ll hold it if I eat with colleagues or boss or in public occasion. This is due to I have to be &quot;polite&quot;. [lieanat]
 Yup. I agree with you too. Have a nice day. [lieanat] 
 For me it sounds ugly. I do not need to show my satisfaction in that way. My facial expression is good enough to reflect my pleasure. And obviously I have seen elderly people who burp after a heavy meal. I do not like that sight at all. [nilzerous1]
 Yea, just say THANK YOU lol. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I can&apos;t recall when was the last time I burp...
I think it was really due to the type of food intake. If i do remember correctly, during younger times, I burp quite often after I finished my Fast Food with a big cup of &quot;COKE&quot;. 


Nowadays, diet has become lightly, less meat, and rarely take carbonated drinks, thus, burping has become less.


I don&apos;t like people burping....Some people will burp and then generate unwanted smell....
 [serena_wai]
 I think it is the coke, Serena. The gas and bubble and all. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I do beleive it is still in practice I think its India for I knew a man that would burp all the time after meal and I do beleive they are from India.
 and sometimes those burps just come out never try too tho lol [Lakota12]
 Oh yea? lol rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I do not and would not burp after a meal, unless one came out of my control decided it was time to burp and then I would hope that it came out muffled. Hmmm I thought for some reason it was Italians that burped to show satisfaction of a meal! Though I&apos;m not sure either, at any rate you are correct some people do burp to show appreciation of a meal. [terri0824]
 Maybe the more traditional ones, hehe. lol [lordwarwizard] 
 As a &quot;Southern Belle&quot; I was always taught it was impolite to burp. I think men like to do it as loud as they can. My husband and son burp a lot. I know some foods make me burp but I try to do it quietly. My husband laughs at me because if I drink a soda (I rarely drink them) I always burp after my first swallow. [jillmalitz]
 Yup, might not look good for a lady to burp loudly. [lordwarwizard] 
 I don&apos;t eat that much so basically, my stomach is half full after each meal. Occasionally, I will burp after drinking soda or soft drink. There is something in the soft drink that causes you to burp no matter how you tried to avoid it. 

But really, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything gross about burping.blink It is a natural reaction that is unavoidable. If people stared at you, just say &quot;excuse me.&quot; End of story. happy [charms88]
 Yea, that&apos;s because of the gas, I guess.

Yea, it can&apos;t be grosser than farting. blinkrasp [lordwarwizard] 
 It&apos;s better to burp than fart. That&apos;s embarrasing when that happens LOL As long as you say excuse me then it should be fine! [maddysmommy]
 Oh yea, you bet! w00t [lordwarwizard] 
 hi it depends on the meal and on where I am..... lol..... when I am at home ( you know my home is my castle) its a little embarrassing when it happens but no catastrophe. I dont drink fizzy drinks such as coke or carbonated mineral water when I eat so that limits burping to a minimum.

But when I am not at home eating but in our cafeteria at work or in a restaurant then burping is out of the question, of course. [book1962]
 its the beginning of digestion, getting the fizz of the fizzy drinks out of your body again..... lol [book1962] 
 I&apos;m with you my friend. I do not burp if I can help it but occasionally it just comes out. If that is the case I excuse myself and continue about what I am doing. What else can you do? [eeyore39]
 Yup, pretty much nothing else. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 My answer is simple- It&apos;s not bad manners, it&apos;s just good food. Everyone does it, it&apos;s a natural way to expel stomach gases. It&apos;s how we act afterwords that is respectful or disrespectful. [jessigirl116]
 lordwarwizard i do not burp on purpose but sometimes
I cannot help it so I do try to mask it if I am
not alone, otherwise I could care less as there
are usually just me myself and I when I am eating.lol
If I am with a group I hope I won&apos;t burp but usually
&apos;I find myself doing it anyway.lol [Hatley]
 Oh yea, if it is just yourself, who cares? lol [lordwarwizard] 
 Haha that was funny! First off, I kind of new here but so far I&apos;m enjoying reading comments and posts. Anyways, burping is not really bad. Actually it&apos;s a good thing to do in a way, cause it means that we had a great meal. However, if people are in in public places, they don&apos;t want to cause embarrassment by burping just to show that they had a great food. I think that would be totally unethical, I think others couldn&apos;t agree more with that. But hey, if you are with your friends, family or yourself, after having a great meal, I don&apos;t think that would be really a big deal if a person burps pretty loud one. I think it could be a good thing to start of a great bonding. I myself, I think I usually muffle my burp, I think it&apos;s already my thing, sometimes, I don&apos;t even notice that I burp at all. Lol [smooch091784]
 Yup yup, if it is with familiar faces, wouldn&apos;t hurt.

Welcome to myLot! lol [lordwarwizard] 
 Well, as I&apos;m usually the cook, I guess if I burp after a meal, I&apos;m complimenting myself LOL! I don&apos;t usually burp to be honest. If I do, it&apos;s totally involuntary and can&apos;t be helped. 

I was brought up being told that burping after a meal was to show satisfaction and a compliment to the chef. But I remembered thinking about how I always got told off for burping at the table lol. Talk about double standards. rolleyes [angelwhispers30]
 LOL, people might think you are drunk. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 Yes I do Burp after when I eat vegetables! and when I do I cover my mouth and do it softly.. [shikimurei]
 Vegetables? How interesting. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I donb&apos;t burp. I leave the males of the household to make disqusting nosies. If i have no choice i go to another room and make my nosie in private! [cjgrooms]
 i burp. thers an old saying that if you burp it ios a compliment to the cook [wagster41]
 I burp so that I do not fart later! LOL It seems to be a natural function, and if I do not burp, I may end up with a pain in my bellie! [olivemai]
 I guess I am burping demon! LOL [olivemai] 
 I don&apos;t view it favorably. I don&apos;t like it. I know that in some Middle Asian countries one should burp as a courtesy to the hos ts after a meal, showing appreciation and satisfaction with the meal.

In also remember the all time favourite movie, Ben-Hur. In that film also the actor at a place after his meals, did not burp and then he was asked to do so by his friend in order to please the host.

Well, if burping is part of culture of a society, let it bew so. [asahibza]
 Do as the Romans do in Rome. But if you are not in Rome... :) [lordwarwizard] 
 Not all the times since we are a group of bachelors living together and we cannot cook proper food. Once in a while when i eat at my relatives place i may burp. But that is a very few rare cases that i burp. [crackhead]
 LOL, can&apos;t say you are wrong. [lordwarwizard] 
 I don&apos;t burp after eating, I rarely do proper burps, I just tend to do a little gurgling noise and that is as close to a burp as I ever really get. I think that burping is rather disgusting as it smells, okay it is natural, but if people do burp they should apologise for it, &quot;Beg my pardon&quot;. [Elixiress]
 Not too gentlemanly or ladylike too. [lordwarwizard] 
 I muffle, but I do burp. I even burp after drinking water! But I don&apos;t project. I think it is rather disgusting when someone belches really loudly. I guess that is why boys like to do it. LOL

I used to work with male employees who would have belching contests to see who could belch the loudest. I guess they never grew out of it.

There are/were cultures that thought it was a sign of a good meal. I&apos;m not sure why some people belch more easily than others. I know that some people can belch on cue. Not a talent I ever developed, however. [youdontsay]
 Maybe you are drinking it too fast? [lordwarwizard] 
 hi
i wud love to burp-sometimes its uncontrollablebut its the worst thing to do-its considered very indecent. [amirev777]
 Lol
This takes me back to childhood. My dad used to burp after a meal and my mom would glare at him. He always said, &quot;Not bad manners, good food&quot;. [makingpots]
 Lol, couple friendly &quot;bickering&quot;. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I don&apos;t burp often after a meal but I sometimes do after too many fizzy drinks! I always try not to pass ANY sort of wind in public and will hold it in til I can excuse myself and do it in private! xxx [mummymo]
 Yea, the gas and all. angry [lordwarwizard] 
 I never burp at all, I would make a terrible guest at a greek occasion for they determine the the goodness of a meal by the number of burps afterwards...lol. I really don&apos;t know why I don&apos;t burp, but my daughter does it enough for both of us...:}. [sumofalltears]
 Lol, that would make for one burping contest. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I burp after a meal specially if I had a softdrink. I try to muffle it of course. But when I got pregnant I had heartburn and couldn&apos;t stop myself from burping a lot. It was either burp or suffer. lol Luckily my husband didn&apos;t mind so much. The only thing is I still am doing that even though I had my baby 3 months ago. :) [mimm45]
 Yea, too much fizzy fizz fizz. [lordwarwizard] 
 no i dont usually burp after eating a meal. but when i drink a lot of soda or water i might let out a small burp. [babystar1]
 Blame the soda. lol [lordwarwizard] 
 nope i dont control it if im on a restaurant i just cover my mouth and utter something of sorry or excuse coz burping in public is i guess un ethical for me..i dont know about the others though...i seldom burp after meal...i remember the last time i did it was when i eat my dinner at a later time and im very hungry... [vanities]
 Most people don&apos;t. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I used to burp and it was loud and couldnt be stifled . But now it does not happen [naseeha]
 i think it&apos;s in arab countries that burping after meals is considered being grateful to the host. i also burp a lot of times but its really involuntary. but its not only after meals. i think that after drinking soda or softdrinks, i&apos;d burp several times. when i&apos;m seated where the aircon vent is directed i also burp and burp and burp. I really try to muffle the sound of my burp specially if im in a public place. but if im with my friends or family, they really wouldnt care at all. [kuting]
 dont think we can control it... maybe try to muffle the sound.. happy

..dont you think that some people just burp much often and easier than others ?.. my second daughter burps more often than the rest of us.. and she burps even louder than her daddy... lol

in our culture.. if you eat till you burp.. in our culture.. it mean you are &apos;over-eating&apos;, and that is not really good thing, or good manners - because.. we are are taught to eat &apos;moderately&apos;... 
so.. though you cant control/stop it.. it is a good idea to muffle the sound... [4mymak]
 I think it is a disorder of sort... [lordwarwizard] 
 yeah~~you are same to me,if i burp,it is out of my control,too.When it happens,i always try to muffle the sound.You know,mostly,the sound is out of control.My mother tell me that drink much water when you burp,but i don&apos;t think it is an useful method.OK,let&apos;s regard it as the satisfaction and appreciation to the meal and the host if you burp,it is a good ideal~~~~~ [xiaojing1226]
 That&apos;s only polite at most places. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I usuallu burp if I drink pop or soda. The bubbles make me burp. When I do burp, I will cover my mouth and say excuse me. Some places the host or hostess get offended if you don&apos;t burp. [Polly1]
 Im only burp when im eating too rapidly, too much lol or when im drinking a lot of pepsi for examplelol Im not burp in front of people to show them that im appreciating meat. I do it has a joke sometimes to my friend. But I hate burp. [julie85]
 Take it slow. Don&apos;t rush. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I seldom burp, but if i consume too much coke, may be I will start burp. Not a happy experience when i started to burp, usually it will last for half a day. [WilsonXu]
 Yea, too much gas. [lordwarwizard] 
 No,I don&apos;t burp ,even though I had more foods.I have no the habit to burp and don&apos;t like to hear the voice of burping.In China ,it&apos;s unpolite to burp.And if you are withe some important customers together,you should say &quot;sorry &quot; or &quot;excuse me&quot;,or you are unpolite. [sanzi1201]
 Same over here. [lordwarwizard] 
 lol interesting,,,i will burp if i am too full,,,and i will have some drinks to stop burpping! [littlewhite]
 Oh? Being full will make you burp? [lordwarwizard] 
 I do burp sometimes but not always and If I am with other people I am very careful to make it the simpler way as possible. Although you know, most of the time burping do happen even if you don&apos;t like because it is gas that really has to come out. It usually happens after eating especially if we have eaten so much and have taken in lots of gas while swallowing our food and drinks. Also if we take in softdrinks or soda drinks all the more burping is encourages because they contain extra gas.

And yes, it looks impolite to burp out loud when you are with other people so when it is really unavoidable and you feel that the burp is already coming on... just say &quot;Excuse Me&quot;. ha! ha! ha! [salonga]
 Yea, actually it is quite a natural reaction. [lordwarwizard] 
 I burp very rarely. I don&apos;t even know why I burp or why I don&apos;t burp. I consider burping to be a bit vulgar and I do try to minimize it if ever I burp. He he he! So I don&apos;t burp loudly. Its a ladylike burp if there is such a thing. [cdparazo]
 It is a natural body thingy. [lordwarwizard] 
 I find that if I drink anything fizzy around the time I have a nice meal that I can&apos;t help but burp, so don&apos;t do it while dining out. [Erratic]
 I don&apos;t usually burp after eating.If I burp I try not to make any sound or try not to burp at all coz I don&apos;t want to catch other&apos;s attention. [bestie]
 Yup, be inconspicuous. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 wow this got many comments . I dont really , but if i have to i will . who cares really . [metschica25]
 Yea, nobody cares. [lordwarwizard] 
 No. Burping. At. All.

In my home and hubby&apos;s culture, it&apos;s EXTREMELY rude to make any sort of noise during meals, much or less burp. 

A lot of people assume that just because I&apos;m Chinese, I&apos;m prone to slurping my food or stuffing myself silly at the dinner table while making tonnes of noises at the top of my voice. I don&apos;t. I actually find that sort of behaviour to be rather impolite.

The world doesn&apos;t need to know that I had a good meal. How good a food is depends on the person eating it so it varies from one person to another.

So yes, no burping for me at all. [meiteoh]
 Wow, EXTREMELY. rasp

Geez, who thinks that of Chinese? angry [lordwarwizard] 
 i don&apos;t burp after eating... in fact, i very seldom burp... once in a while i burp accidentally... but that is not because of the meal... but it is because of drinking soda... i never try to stop myself from burping... take care and have a nice day... [lingli_78]
 You too, my friend. :) [lordwarwizard] 
 sometimes i will,you know.after a sumptuous meal....
you can&apos;t control not to burp.
but i won&apos;t tell the world it is a good meal through burping.i don&apos;t try not to burp at all.even i have dinner in restaurant.it&apos;s a normal thing.no need to hide.... [xialinye]
 Oh yea, there are times when it is just impossible to control. blush [lordwarwizard] 
 I don&apos;t often eat so full for each meal. And therefore I seldom burp. I think it&apos;s somewhat embarrassing to burp in pubic after a meal.

I love China [youless]
 I burp frequently though I really don&apos;t want to burp.My mum always scold me after burp,she says it&apos;s terrible thing to a girl.hehe..but it&apos;s not easy to control after eat a lot.
Ah, I foget mention,I have womenresouces one disease that I can&apos;t control to eat more and more,even lunch is going boom,I still eat until spew.So almost i burp after each meal. [camilla_l]
 Hehe, not too ladylike. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I feel it is not a good habit to burp loud..I was told the same thing when I was young..I tell the same thing to my family members also. I ask them to make it private or soundless. I too do not burp aloud..This is the first time I have read that burping aloud is said to be a way to show the fullness.This is quite interesting..may be I can look over..But according to modern etiquettes, I think burping aloud is a bad manner. [smilyn]
 Yea, etiquette thingy. [lordwarwizard] 
 not at all times. i can&apos;t control my burping. but i really love it sometimes when i burp. feels like i&apos;m really full.=) [neiloid]
 Oh yea, sometimes it is just beyond us. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 How can try not to burp if it really comes to you? I did burp occasionally, it happened after full meals or during stomach empty, and being a woman, if burp publicly would not be decent, are you agree? [Dorislee]
 You can&apos;t control it sometimes. [lordwarwizard] 
 burping comes naturally to me, literally !! Most of the times I can&apos;t control it, and actually controlling it is sometimes very painful..and except among family and friends it is looked down upon as downright rude.. [adityakawatra]
 yap, i do burp after eating it means my stomach is full and sometimes when i drink softdrinks i got 3-4 times burping haha.. ^^ [buzzer88]
 Haha, so much soda.:P [lordwarwizard] 
 Burping is a normal process carried out to release the oxygen and nitrogen gas from our body..When m at home, i eat fast and as a result i burp but witout much noise...In public places i dont do that...But when i have carbonated drinks, i burp.. [PriyaValli]
 Oh yea, perfectly normal really. [lordwarwizard] 
 I try not to but if I do is because it is out of my control... like you :) [maplaver]
 I don&apos;t burp after a meal.....even though it&apos;s not considered rude where I am from. In fact, a host/hostess will be very pleased if a person burps after eating at their place. It shows they have enjoyed the meal.
I rarely burp and if I do, it&apos;s mostly in private. [SViswan]
 Well, it is just that here, burping isn&apos;t usually expected. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I usually leave it to nature. If I feel like burping, then I do it quietly without attracting too much attention, but I try not to force it or do it regularly. I just let my body decides when it wants to burp and get on with it. :o) [MsCYPRAH]
 Lol, of course we try not to force for the sake of forcing. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 i don&apos;t usually burp after my meal, sumptuous or not. maybe it has got to do with chewing. i chew all my food into very small pieces before i swallow. my friend who wolfs down his food does burp sometimes. the only times i would burp is when i drink gassy drinks. i love to take big gulps of icy cold gassy drink. but after that it&apos;ll be a long burp. i don&apos;t mind others burping in front of me, as long as they cover their mouth when they burp. it&apos;s important as burps usually are followed by a nasty smell. cheers. [applefreak]
 In fact, I think most would not burp. [lordwarwizard] 
 There are still places in the world today that a burp is an indication of enjoyment of a good meal.

Not in most of the U.S., however. [ElicBxn]
 hey !i do one in a while but most of the time.. with my friends.. !
they nevermind.. they just laugh .. 1:)
no ..i never tried to muffle.. the sound... never ever try to force ur body ..reations.. thats wat i believe..! [kethavat]
 Only with familiar faces. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I dont burp so loud and not so often also, there are times i burp because i drink sodas. It&apos;s normal for a person to burp everyone knows it. [honeyfyona]
 I burp. Even not immediately after a meal. I guess that got constipated. That is totally unintentional. But if I can control it, I will control it. Burps make me feel more comfortable especially after a very heavy meal... [neildc]
 Hard to control sometimes. [lordwarwizard] 
 I just let nature take it&apos;s coarse. Burp or fart. Let er rip. You sure wouldn&apos;t feel good keeping it in so why bother? [jdyrj777]
 If I burp--it is also out of my control, usually after I drink soda. It does bother me when people make themselves burp. One of my daycare boys does this all the time--and it drives me crazy. One of my biggest pet peeves you could say. [SweetVTmom]
 Yup, natural body reaction. Yet some are embarrassed if they do burp. [lordwarwizard] 
 Hello lordwarwizard, actually I don&apos;t burp after meal, but there is always air in my stomach, which make me feel uncomfortable. In late afternoon, the air will come out of my body in the form of wind from bowels.;-) [chunshuibingdou]
 well,i sometimes do that when am overfilled also in my culture people tend to look at you in a bad way if you burp after eating but of course you cant avoid it if you have been overfed by your host,i do it but i try as much as possible to do it silently when in the midst of people but if am alone i take liberty [BYOLA2871]
 what would you say about farting in the midst of people?hahahaah!w00t [BYOLA2871] 
 ALWAYS! OF COURSE! Anyone that says they don&apos;t burp after eating has something wrong with them or they are full of it. Really. It is a natural, normal and necessary bodily function.

I know some cultures say that it is a compliment to burp after the meal, but really, it just has to happen. [AnnieOakley1]
 First time I am hearing this. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 It is there in our country also .We show satisfaction that whatever we have eaten has satisfied us.But nowadays this system is going as it is thought to be ill manner.But still in home when there is informal environment we do it. [rb200406]
 Yup yup, when it is family. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I try not to burp at all. If I do feel a burp coming on I try to muffle the sound. [gberlin]
 If I had to burp pal I would try to muffle the sound , I can&apos;t remember the last time I did it to be honest , :) xx [weemam]
 I do not burp intentionally. I think it is rude to do so and when I cannot help it, I excuse myself. How it could be consider the sign that you enjoyed the meal is beyond me. To me, it would be the sign that I ate too much and that I made a pig out of myself. I really do not think that is a sign of respect so I try not to burp. [suspenseful]
 That was long ago... but now... [lordwarwizard] 
 Sometimes I burp after dinner because I have too much. The air is out of my control form my stomach... [leafgxu]
 Yea, uncontrollably. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 Yep I do. Better out than in I always say. It&apos;s healthy. [deskue]
 If I must burp, I do try to muffle it. If I am around home though that may not be the case. [jer31558]
 If I am in public, I most likely will try and muffle the sound or not burp at all if possible. If at home though, I may burp out loud though nothing to shake the walls. [jer31558]
 Yup, to be considerate.:) [lordwarwizard] 
 no....i get an urge 2 burp very rarely....but wen i get it i burp 2 my heart&apos;s fill :P, coz 1 shud nt stop dis urge [amajumdar52]
 Of course friend,

Burping is a natural thing, which is some times unavoidable.

Many cases we can avoid burp. Ofcourse it is symbol of showing that meal is good. [jyo_sa2]
 Yup, can&apos;t avoid sometimes. [lordwarwizard] 
 Burping is actually a natural bodily function and it depends on where I am how I handle it. When I am out in public, I try not to burp loudly but I also do not try too much go hold it in as it is uncomfortable. I am always polite enough to excuse myself if I do burp. When I am at home, I will burp when I feel that I need to since I have no one to answer to. My youngest daughter could win burping contests, she burps so loudly. She tells the story of being in a club one time and how poorly the women in a burping contest burped on stage but she didn&apos;t enter. She was concerned that they would ask the contestants to do more than just burp. My mother always used to say that there was more room than there is in whenever she was burping. [idowrite72]
 Thanks for sharing! lol [lordwarwizard] 
 i do lol i burp after i eat most of the times. sometimes i even burp when i don&apos;t eat anything lol [rhane7315]
 That is something I dont have control over. After a meal no matter where I am and I burp.I will cover my mouth and say, Excuse me/or sorry. No one stairs me down. [sun2day]
 Yup, sometimes it can be really hard or impossible to control. [lordwarwizard] 
 I burp mostly because im too full! hahaha! I always consider burping with a hanky to cover my mouth. I would rather burp it out than turn it to flatulence! :p [islawpalitaw]
 Too much gas. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 I do burp after meals but not always. Actually the sound and when it is about to come out can be controlled. I can control my burping in public but when at home...I just let go. I dono if anyone has controlled their burping? [eagle_f15]
 We can try to minimize to almost not noticeable. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 I do burp sometimes but i didn&apos;t mean to do it.Its just happened,lol. [giePortlandOR_08]
 Yup I do burp a lot after a meal whether it is a big meal or just a snack. I feel uncomfortable when I don&apos;t burp. But I try to control the sound of my burp i don&apos;t like people getting offended when they hear me burping. [quawertz]
 Oh... maybe something to do with your digestive system. [lordwarwizard] 
 I don&apos;t try to burp, but sometimes it just happens. I always say excuse me afterwards, and sometimes (depending on who is around) I will say that it&apos;s not bad matters, it&apos;s good food. But it really depends on if I am at home and who is around me if I say that. [lovespecialangel]
 I know babies need to be burped after a meal. However, adults? I find it disgusting and sort of rude if adults were to burp after a meal to show satisfaction. I would think it is more for personal pleasure for I do enjoy that occasional reflexive burp if I were to gulp down an icy cold gassy drink. [whyaskq]
 burping? i&apos;ve been teached n i&apos;ve learned n saw n burping loud in front of people is rude...i duno about that...but i do feel uncomfortable if im eating when suddenly sum1 burps loudly.ahahahah.i would control my burp..if i really wan to burp...i&apos;ll close my mouth n burp so dat the noise wont be so loud.eheheh.cheers. [taqinaka]
 Actually if we think about it, it is quite a natural body reaction. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 In Japan and other Asian countries, it is considered rude if you don&apos;t burp after a meal. Burping shows how much you appreciated the food, and also makes room for you to eat more, which the Japanese love getting you to do. lol.

Burping is natural, and if you don&apos;t, well the gas has to come out somewhere and unfortunately, that means from your bum and is often smellier and louder.

burping is the best way to get rid of excess gas in your digestive system. [newzealtralian]
 Different places, different cultures. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 Of course I can&apos;t control it when I have to burp, but I can control the noise level. After I eat a meal I almost always burp. I guess when I eat I get a lot of air in my stomach because I burp a lot. I guess I need to learn to chew with my mouth closed so i get less air.lol There is nothing wrong with burping, just to have the manners to try to cover it up. [chrislotz]
 Yea, same here. [lordwarwizard] 
 Well osmething after eating i will made the sound burp.that is no the sound to shown any satifaction or disatifation sound,it is the sound csnnot control by ourself. Normally i will made burp sound after eating the fly and oily food. It is the burp sound we made is good for us? [moveadlung76]
 Yea, sometimes we just can&apos;t control it. [lordwarwizard] 
 NO, but my darling, beautiful, dainty, blonde hair, blue eyed little grand daughter can burp better than most rednecks! This little one lets one out and you&apos;d swear Paul Bunyan just did it! Funniest thing cause she is so dainty and perfect - looks like Dakota Fanning at age 6 - and then this huge horrible sound comes out of that dainty perfect little mouth. [coffeebreak]
 Young expert! rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 check this out:.. http://bux.to/?r=omermansur [omermansur]
 i don&apos;t burp either. i don&apos;t know, but i think it is because proper table manners say so that it is unethical to burp aloud when you are in public places. it also turns me off when someone i am not that close to, or someone that i just met burps in front of me. but i think there&apos;s nothing wrong with burping, i just grew up being told not to do it in front of people in public places. [julyteen]
 i don&apos;t burp after eating. it&apos;s one of the lessons taught to us when it comes to table manners. in college, we are taught that it is unethical to burp out loud in public places. so when i feel like burping, i try to control it&apos;s sounds. [julyteen]
 Yes you are right, to burp after a meal was to show appreciation of the meal and to not do so would be classed as an insult. Somehow though that seems to have changed and is now found to be rude and disgusting or common to some people. I have to do it because once I do I can fit more food in, and if I hold it in I get tummy ache and sometimes it just comes out without me knowing it was there in the first place! [gemini_rose]
 At some places! rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 good day.. I usually don&apos;t burp but when I do I don&apos;t do it on public. [blackmantra_x]
 not 2 much I usually burp whenever I drink pop. [coco526]
 I never burp. Even if the temptation to burp comes, I resist it with great power and determination. That is because burping is a bad habit, in my opinion. Oneshould never burp.
But these days, you see everybody is burping. This is because of heavy food. People consume lot of red meat, pizza etc, and these foods will cause one to burp more and mre. [kangallo]
 Sometimes it is simply... irresistible! rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 Hi lordwarwizard,

I do burp but it&apos;s also out of control. I don&apos;t burp just to show how I appreciate the meal being served.LOL! It&apos;s not acceptable in the environment where I am. But, in the house, I burp all the time not because I want it but I just have a lot of acid within..LOL! [checapricorn]
 Hard to control really, sometimes. rasp [lordwarwizard] 
 It is always the other way around for me.I burp a lot when I feel hungry.May be the hyper acidity.happy [balasri]
 i don&apos;t usually burp after a meal. the thing that will definitely make me burp is gassy drink. a long gulp of gassy drinks is enough to make me burp. but food doesn&apos;t really do that to me. i rarely burp after eating, unless the meal is accompanied by gassy drinks. ;p [applefreak]
 i burp alright but i cover my mouth when i do. i can&apos;t stop it and if i am able to stop it, it would hurt on my chest. so i just let it out and cover my mouth while doing so. my burp is usually low and i only burp noisily if i drink some softdrinks. happy 

reminds me of an incident when me and my friends ate at Mcdonald&apos;s in Tagaytay. this guy friend of mine, he had the nerve to burp like there was no tomorrow, all the customers looked at us, surprised and shocked! we immediately stood up and left that guy friend of ours and he followed us laughing! not a little embarrassed. so we just laughed at it too. lol [secretbear]
 Yup, I try to make it as unobtrusive as I can. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 no, i don&apos;t burp after eating... but i burp a little when i drink and eat so much gassy foods.., but its always late and not to much noisy..hehe.. [cuttyrish]
 Yea... that is understandable. happy [lordwarwizard] 
 that&apos;s a stupid post!!! just burp.. who cares!!!! burp sound can be control.. no such thing as poeple try not to burp at all.. that&apos;s stupid!!!!!! stupid post or forum!!! [CLEVERMIND]
 Well, I can burp freely if I&apos;m at home, but outside and in public places or when I&apos;m with someone, I really try hard not to burp. [autumndreamer]
