Gyros Express has nothing on this place! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 1 of 1 Yahoo! Users found this review helpful           USER RATING By Roger , 7/13/09 Dont ever patronize this place - ever. Ordered take out and got home and half the order was in the bag and the other half was barely cooked. Called to voice my concerns and was told&quot;dont come back - we are busy&quot;. Called back a second time and was hung up on. Drove back up to the place looking for a refund and first was told&quot;no&quot;, then was told they were going to call police on me, then was asked to leave the store, then they offered to replace my order and when I said I wanted my money back for the 10th time they said again they were going to call the police. This is how they treat customers!!!!!!!!! When they finally did offer to refund my money the guy tried short changing me. I&apos;d rather starve then eat here and I hope they go out of business. NEWS FLASH - you need me more than I need your half cooked food. Everyone I know has promised to never go back! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 2 of 4 Yahoo!
