 ★★★☆☆ QUESTIONABLE SANITATION Fast Food At Best 
 Jonathon N. 3 Firewood Caf 
 
I first emailed the owners about their reasoning of silverware not being in wrap or instead in a basket where everyone&apos;s hands reached in to pick up a utinsil. They ignored my email.

It&apos;s flu season. There&apos;s a open basket where reuseable silverware is there for the taking (this is a semi fast food self serve restaurant) and EVERYONE reaches in this basket with their hands.

You order yourself fast-food style forming a line and then take a table. Food is later delivered.

Bring your own water as none is offered.

Wine prices were stiff at $7.00 to 9.50 a glass for a very small pour.

Pizza was good. Pasta&apos;s were weak.

As long as you don&apos;t mind paying restaurant prices for a no-service semi fast food restaurant, FIREWOOD will work for you.

 ★★★☆☆ Extremely thin, crispy pizza but the pasta is so-so

Nice atmosphere. Prices are within reason and the pizza...well, technically this is pretty good pizza but it&apos;s the kind that&apos;s so thin it&apos;s almost into matzoh cracker territory and some people don&apos;t care for that. I don&apos;t mind the style but it&apos;s not particularly filling and makes this pizza more of an appetizer than a meal. The sauces and toppings are okay but not soul-thrilling or innovative. This is mall food and for that it&apos;s not bad. I did order a vegetarian tortellini that turned out to be inedible balls of not-quite-cooked vegetable paste in doughy casings. It was in a passable marinara sauce but even the sauce could not hide the structural failure of these tortellini. Mushy and underdone.

Stick with the pizza. The kid&apos;s portion pizza is excellent. Our 5 yo gobbled it up and (owing to the thinness of this pizza) started in on her parent&apos;s food. The service was fine. Cafeteria style, self-seating. They accepted my rejection of the mushy tortellini and brought me a pizza margherita I ate and enjoyed.

So to sum up: Thin to insubstantial but reasonably tasty pizza crackerlettes running at about $8.95 each. Useful as a snack but you will be hungry again within 2 hours.
