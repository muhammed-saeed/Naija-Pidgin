 Have you ever Been taken on a date to McDonald&apos;s fast food restaurant? Q: A: When you have been with your husband for almost 8 years, yes. We always go on&quot;dates&quot;to McDonalds. Its cheap and we get to make fun of all the strange people that go there to eat. Its fun - I wouldnt trade it for the world! LOL!!...Seriously Have you ever been in a fast food restaurant when one of the staff starts wiping/cleaning your own table? Q: If you are trying to enjoy your meal at a McDonald&apos;s and the cleaning staff comes to wipe the small table you&apos;re sitting at with a rag, is this acceptable? Or is it rude? What if they wipe the rag within inches of your food? A: I think it&apos;s rude, if the table would have been obviously dirty I wouldn&apos;t have been sitting there in the first place. I think it&apos;s pretty disgusting because I&apos;ve seen them wipe of the lid of a trash can and then proceed to wipe down tables. It makes my skin crawl. Has anyone ever won anything big from these games that fast food restaurants are always playing? Q: Scrabble is going on at Subway and Monopoly at McDonald&apos;s and I know that other places must be playing games as well or have in the past. Just wondered if anyone ever actually won anything besides free food. I did actually win a bike from Taco Bell about 15 years ago. A: Nothing more than a free soda or buger sometimes.When the game piece gives me instructions to go to a website , i just toss it.I don&apos;t want to have to look up stuff. Just let me peel off or scratch the damn thing&amp;let me know if I won already. TOP
