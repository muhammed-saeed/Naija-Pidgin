 The methods used for repairing and replacing windshields have become efficient and standardized, which brings more parties into the business. Quality of repairs may be about the same from one provider to another. Competition keeps the repair fees down. There seems little reason to choose one repair shop over another. However, the repair shop may be able to get bulk discounts on certain goods and services which consumers, in turn, can redeem at full value. The consumer may choose the particular shop instead of a competitor, or instead of just leaving the windshield cracked for a while. The shop gets revenue. The car wash / restaurant / retailer may bring in one more customer, who may become a repeat. It&apos;s all about people wanting to get their part of the economy going full-steam.

 THink about how many window or glass repair shops there are, and then consider how often anyone ever actually breaks their windshield.

It&apos;s simple math.

 Generally, windshield repairs are paid for by insurance. If you were paying your own costs, they would get business by offering low prices. But if you are covered by insurance, all prices are the same to you - zero. So they offer you goodies, paid for (effectively) with the insurance money,

 Maybe they have a deal with the businesses they are offering the incentives from so that those businesses can in turn get more customers.
