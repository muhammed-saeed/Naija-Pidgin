Singles Scavenger Hunt (San Francisco)?
 I&apos;m part of a singles group in San Francisco and helping to organize a Scavenger Hunt where teams will be organized with same number boys/girls in a particular age range. Hopefully, sparks in each team will fly but, if nothing else, it&apos;s a great way to meet new people.

It&apos;s probably pretty obvious but the goal is to send teams around San Francisco, with a digital camera and ziplock bag, to find&quot;whatever&quot;based on the clues -- meet up a few hours later and see who wins.

Anyone have some fun ideas that are borderline sexy/naughty (since it&apos;s a singles group) but not to raunchy since people don&apos;t know each other (fully) yet?

I have basic ideas like&quot;Photo of girls sitting on boys lap while on a cable car&quot;or&quot;Get a flower from street vendor&quot;or&quot;receipt from a round of beers at XXX&quot;….

but would love to hear some new ideas!…
Please?! And, many thanks!
