Whataburger: Bland, Disappointing Burgers

 More: Lettuce Coupons Couponing Burger King Whopper 
 Flag Close Post a comment In the past 6 months, I have been seeing these blue and white buildings, with orange- and white-striped roofs. When I looked at the sign, they are called Whataburger. I then realized that we had one fairly close to home.
We are not big burger eaters although I have to admit that Len and I do have the odd Burger King Whopper from time to time. A couple of days ago we just couldn&apos;t decide where to eat. I looked in my Entertainment Book and saw that there were several buy one get one free coupons at Whataburger so off we headed.

It was lunchtime so we expected the place to be jamming. Wrong. The restaurant was almost empty. It is a fast food restaurant with a twist. You place your order but they deliver it to your table. I can remember this sometimes happening at Long John Silver&apos;s restaurants many years ago, when they were behind in orders, so they gave you a number and then brought it to your table.

There were two young ladies behind the counter and they greeted us politely and with a smile. We commented on that. I asked if they could give us a few minutes, as this was our first visit. Behind them was the usual board with an array of food and drinks to chose from.

As I had the coupon for the Whataburger we both decided to try it @ $2.29. The young lady said it comes with lettuce, tomato, mushroom, onion, pickles, and mustard, is that all right? We both said yes and I asked for extra pickles on mine. We order medium fries for Len @ $1.39 and a small coke @ $1.29. I had water as I had already been to a restaurant for breakfast and couldn&apos;t take other cup of coffee.

We were given our number and our drink cups. We only waited a few minutes and our meals were delivered to our table. The young lady also brought a basket of condiments. Len and I chatted to her for quite awhile.

The food was lovely and hot and the burger looked big. They state it is a 5-inch bun. I opened mine up to see a thin piece of meat, the 100% pure American beef, loads of lettuce and the other items. Len took half his lettuce out to eat his burger. I got a knife and fork to tackle mine. All I could taste was the mustard. It had a strong flavor and so much of it. I had been thinking that this would be a healthier burger than the Whopper as they were replacing mayo with mustard. Now I wish I had said hold the mustard. I took a piece of the beef, from the bottom, to do a taste test. It was so bland and extremely disappointing. I helped Len out with the fries and they were good.

While Len was getting a refill of his diet coke I went to the bathroom. It was spotlessly clean, but in a new building I would have expected nothing less. Upon my return I looked at the windows and it stated open 24 hours a day. There was a poster on the wall saying that the chain was started in 1950.

Getting back to the menu board they had 8 combos from $3.99 - $5.89. There were chicken and fish items too.

There were 5 breakfast combos from $2.99 -$3.69.

The kids had 2 meals to choose from @ $2.99.

There were side dishes and salads from $2.99 - $4.68.

To finish off there were apple pie @ 99 cents, cookie @ 79 cents and cinnamon roll @ $1.49.

Drinks consisted off coffee, soda, shakes, malts, juice, etc.

This Whataburger is store 870 located at:

4205 U.S. 19,

New Port Richey,

Florida 34652.

Telephone 727-848-7776.

They have a suggestions number at 1-800-6burger. Perhaps I should phone them as I probably won&apos;t be going back to use the 5 remaining coupons. I am sure this burger was much healthier than my Whopper but Burger King I&apos;ll take you anytime.

Sounds like the out-of-state places get the shaft. I&apos;ve never had a disappointing one here in Texas, actually about to go there now...

You people are all ignorant and dumb. It doesnt matter if the restuarant is bad or not you are your own dam person go out and try the food instead of listening to some random person you will never ever meet.

Whataburger in Texas is the best fast food burger by a long shot. I can&apos;t speak for other states, but it&apos;s not even close here.

You probably have better meat in Texas.

I&apos;m a real fan of Whataburger and I think that they are one of the best fast food burgers around. My wife and I always stop at Whataburger when we visit our relatives in Texas.
However, I noticed that Whataburger franchises that are located in other states are of a poorer quality. Maybe there&apos;s a higher standard of quality in Texas because that&apos;s where they started and their corporate hq is located.

I certainly don&apos;t want to try this one. Thanks for your well written, honest review.

Great Burger, lame service. After hearing over and over about how great they are, after one finally opened in bumfark georgia, had to try it. Oh well. I thought GW Bush was good in 2000. Live and Learn.

Sounds like they were friendly, at least. (Plus you saved a bit with the coupon!)
 Veronica Davidson 12/29/2007 
I LOVE WHATABURGER!! It&apos;s one of my favs!

I&apos;m not into burgers, except veggie burgers, but this place sounds really disappointing.
