 Specialty Stores&amp;Restaurants 
 
 
 
 
 A Specialty Store or Restaurant is a store, usually retail, that offers specific and specialized types of items or foods. These stores focus on selling a particular brand, or a particular type of item or food. For example, a store that exclusively sells cell phones or video games, or a restaurant that uses all organic foods, would be considered specialized. 
 
 The flourishing  Specialty Food Industry is being fueled by new flavors, new products and growing consumer interest in artisanal and organic foods. Retail sales of specialty foods rose 9.2 percent between 2010 and 2011 as specialty food consumers cut back on restaurant meals in favor of purchasing more specialty and natural foods to enjoy at home.
