 Hammer K3 Perform Panel Saw Spec 

 by ondablade »Wed Jul 07, 2010 5:45 pm
 I&apos;ve a bit of a tussle going on with Felder over the specification of the single phase K3 Perform 2,500mm sliding table panel saw they supplied me with a few months ago.

The brochure and website pricing/configurator page i ordered against, and more recently the User Manual all seem to agree that the single phase K3 Perform is supplied as standard with a 4kW/5.5HP motor. Which was a big factor in my deciding to order one - my old Robland X 260 combo at 3HP could struggle on deep rips with a 10in blade unless the blade was dead right, and the K3 runs a 12in.

The machine low and behold surfaced with a 3kW motor fitted which was a big disappointment. But the literature i&apos;ve seen doesn&apos;t even list a 3kW motor as an option for the Perform on it. The smaller Basic and Winner models are fitted standard with 3kW. Yet the sales guy is arguing that the 3kW is standard on the Perform.

It&apos;s not been run yet as the shop is being done up, but time is getting tight.

Does anybody have one of these saws, and do you know what motor you have? Alternatively, do you have any insight/information into what the story might be here? Could there be any technical reason why 4kW has become a problem? If 3kW was to turn out to be the only option do you have any feeling for how it might do on thick cuts in hardwood on a 12in blade?

 I can&apos;t comment on the Hammer machine, and you appear to be correct having just browsed the Felder/Hammer website, but... I have the Felder KF700 in single phase, and the largest motor they supply on that is 5HP/3.6kw, and that is a pricey extra because it is basically 3-phase motors with an inverter built in for variable speed control.

So having said that, I&apos;d very much doubt that they would fit a hobby/light trade machine with a 5.5HP motor as standard (and at no extra cost according to their pricelist), so I&apos;m afraid I think their literature is incorrect, but you&apos;d certainly have a very big case to argue with them for a significant reduction in price if they sold it to you on the basis that you would be receiving a 5.5HP motor. davyowen Site Admin   Posts: 1498 Joined: Fri Sep 28, 2007 12:19 pm Location: Port Toilet, South Wales, UK

 My C3/41 has 3KW/4HP motors which I thought were standard. The Robland was a 3HP motor so your Hammer is still has 33% more power. I regularly rip 3&quot;Douglas Fir without problem and it is certainly a superior animal to the Robland.

My understanding is that they are in fact 3 phase motors with the 3 phase supply being produced by two coke can sized capacitors in the selector starter box, certainly mine is. This is an old idea but I had not previously come across it myself.

You will need a 240V/16A supply but I doubt if you will feel it is underpowered. Cheers

 When i bought my Felder. They sent a specification through for me to check before confirming the purchase. If you have such a sheet what does it say? mine was several pages of Felder part references which was very hard to follow but the detail was in there.

If all the blurb says 5.5 HP then you have a case for either a refund or a serious renegotiation on price as they have not supplied what you and they contracted for.

Even if the web site says one thing and the specification something else you may still have a case PAC Occasional Poster

 If you look right at the top of this page it says under Equipment that it has a 4HP but the spec below says 5.5 is standard so they may argue that it comes with 4hp. Does seem something is wrong, I always thought part of the perform package was the bigger motor.

 http://www.ukhammer.co.uk/gb-en/product ... pment.html 

And I&apos;m sure they have a bit of small print that says spec may vary

 I don&apos;t know what the situation on single phase motor sizes is in the wider Felder range is Davy. It&apos;s certainly no problem to buy single phase motors on the open market off the shelf up to at least 5HP, and the extra cost isn&apos;t that much. I gather you can go bigger to order. i.e. this would be no problem for an OEM. I wonder if the extra cost in the case of the KF 700 isn&apos;t mostly to do with the variable speed control, as i don&apos;t think (?) there&apos;s such a thing on the K3 Perform. Whatever the logic/technicalities there&apos;s a 5kW single phase option listed for the K3 Perform in the handbook as well.

If their literature is incorrect it&apos;s pretty comprehensively so, in that single phase 4kW motors are offered on the F3 and A3 41 too. Not to mention that the 4kW single phase option is listed for the K3 Perform not just on the web page, but also in the 08/09 catalogue and as i said very clearly in the user manual provided with the saw. It&apos;s a bit more than a typo.

A quick check on the website suggests Modernist that the combos even in the Perform model are specified with 3kW motors - that the stand alone K3 Perform panel saw is the only machine i can see that lists a 4kW single phase motor as standard.

The website has a lot of glitches anyway. Clicking on Felder Group Ireland&apos;s Hammer page for example brings up the Iranian web page, on my laptop anyway. Another website peculiarity is the &apos;equipment&apos; page you list Jason with the mention of the 3kW/4HP motor at the top: http://www.ukhammer.co.uk/gb-en/product ... pment.html I&apos;d not seen it before as I&apos;d worked from the configurator/pricing page which I took to be the definitive price/specification page - but either way this mention doesn&apos;t say that the stock single phase motor on the Perform is 3kW/4HP.

The fact is that the configurator/pricing page doesn&apos;t even mention the availability of a 3kW single phase motor on the K3 Perform: http://www.ukhammer.co.uk/gb-en/product ... rator.html It&apos;s logical however that it can be fitted as 3kW is used on most of the other machines, and they presumably have the same saw spindle set up.

There was the typical order confirmation document Pac, it was this showing the motor as 3kW that brought up the question of motor size in the first place. The whole affair has been delayed by the fact that my Felder guy when I brought the motor size issue up with him insisted that the stock single phase motor on the K3 Perform is the 3kW - I had to go back to check the documentation to confirm that my recollection of the literature was correct.

Anyway. Time will tell how it shakes out. It&apos;s not that serious an issue provided 3kW will comfortably power a 12 in blade in deep cuts on hardwood, but I&apos;m in need of convincing about that. I&apos;ve told the sales guy that just blindly insisting that 3kW is standard is not good enough given how 4kW single phase is listed right through the literature...

Thank you for all your inputs, I&apos;ll update as and when.

 I suspect that the salesman, either by design or incompetence, has dropped one. Don&apos;t take No for an answer and don&apos;t accept what they initially offer by way of price reduction. Whether or not it can handle your cutting requirements is neither here nor there. It comes down to what they contracted to supply you with.

Their website quite clearly shows it comes standard with the larger motor. I&apos;d grab a screen grab of their website asap though. The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time.

 I would have thought this was covered by the&quot;Sale of Goods Act&quot;

Web site and documents say one thing. reality is another........

call Trading Standards and ask their opinion.

Then call the supplier and suggest you will be referring to TS. I may have the solution to your cutting problems. cuttingsolutions Occasional Poster

 The &apos;Perform&apos; is a package which includes, among other things, a 5.5HP motor. I have catalogues going back a few years specifying this, unless they have just changed the spec. Knowing them, it&apos;s a cock-up. If you want the 5.5HP, ask them to swap it rather than refunding. It&apos;s their problem and it&apos;s reasonable to lend you that machine until they can deliver. &apos;Refund&apos; will send the Austrian mindset into a spin anyway. They won&apos;t give you the price of a cup of tea if they can help it.

 The web page says
 Motor 4.0 HP (5.5/7.5 HP)... 

So the standard motor is 4HP with 5.5HP and 7.5HP motors as options. 4HP is a tad under 3KW so nowhere near 5.5kw. I think you must have been misreading the information. Nick Webb, Fine Furniture, Cambridge

 But further down that page (line 008) it says that the standard motor is 5.5hp. However, lines 001 and 003 indicate that 3 phase is standard and single phase is an option. So, if you opt for a 1 phase m/c you&apos;ll get a 4hp motor and if you buy a 3 phase m/c you have a choice of 5.5 or 7.5hp.

I&apos;m not registered on the site so can&apos;t see what happens to the configurator when you choose a single phase motor - if it changes the spec to show a 4hp motor is fitted when the 1 phase box is ticked then the web site is ok, but if it still shows a 5.5hp motor and this spec is carried through to the ordering stage then Felder have made a mistake.

 Just checked and it was quite happy to configure me a single phase 7.5HP motor. The 5.5HP is the standard offering. The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time.

 That&apos;s not how i interpreted it at all Steve, in that I can&apos;t see that it matters whether single or three phase is designated as &apos;standard&apos; - what matters is what HP/kW options come up after the &apos;single phase&apos; selection is made. The point is that 3kW/4HP isn&apos;t even mentioned anywhere as a motor option in the configurator.

Click &apos;single phase&apos; in the configurator and as TNAF says 4kW/5.5HP is the option displayed that is marked &apos;S&apos; or standard - with absolutely no indication that it&apos;s only a three phase option. What&apos;s more 4kW motors are offered as optional extras on the single phase F3 and A3 41.

The &apos;equipment&apos; tab as you say mentions the possibility of a 4HP motor for the Perform in the general heading Modernist, but this is not the pricing and configuration tool, and was in fact only brought to my attention yesterday. Even there it&apos;s pretty ambiguous as to what &apos;4.0HP(5.5/7.5HP)&apos; might mean - it makes no mention of single or three phase options, and has nothing to say about what&apos;s standard or an optional extra. Against that the configurator, the brochure and the user manual all absolutely specifically list 4kW as the standard option/specififcation - the latter in a column clearly titled &apos;single phase&apos;.

Since yesterday I&apos;ve spoken to my local Felder guy again, he&apos;s absolutely adamant that 3kW is (and always was) the only single phase option available on the K3 Perform. My point to him is that I&apos;m not sure how he expects me to take that on trust with the weight of three separate factory documents saying otherwise, with no mention of a 3kW option for the Perform, with 3kW clearly listed as standard on the smaller sliding table saws, and a 4kW single phase motor listed as an option on the A3 41 and F3. He may even be correct on this, but to me it beggars belief that the literature and website could be so full of typos/errors/ambiguities on such a basic selling point.

He&apos;s decided that since the issue seems to stem from the factory literature to pass it on to somebody there to resolve.

My take at this stage is that it&apos;s pretty much unarguable but that the literature lists 4kW as standard on the single phase K3 Perform. Which leaves the only question to be answered at this stage that of whether or not this somehow is in error.

If it was to turn out that there is or was at any time a single phase 4kW motor available on the K3 Perform (specifically the Perform as the other models are listed with 3kW) this would beg some tough questions. If not then I think it&apos;s most probably a typo or some other sort of boob... ondablade Occasional Poster

I have got the machine in question but just try getting to the motor plate It is still my understanding that all single phase Hammer machines had a 3KW/4HP motor/s. I suspect it may be the same 3 Phase motor as the 5.5 but only produces 4 owing to the phase converter/emulator from single phase.

Hammer reps are notorious for their ignorance - just try ordering spares. Add to that the legendary intransigence of the Austrian manufacturer and it&apos;s just as well the basic machines are worth the hassle. Cheers

 I&apos;ve asked the question on FOG Jason. One slightly ambiguous reply possibly saying that 4kW is not available in single phase (but nothing about the historical position), with maybe more to come. One gent has pointed out that some of the Felder combo machines from about 10 years ago only had 2kW motors on them.

I have the 09 brochure, printed copies of the configurator page and the user manual TNAF. Also the order confirmation which by showing 3kW triggered this whole deal. Trouble is i only twigged it after i took delivery - i guess i was thinking German efficiency (i know it&apos;s Austrian ) so that having agreed the machine i wasn&apos;t super picky in checking the paperwork.

Thanks you for taking a look Brian. I too had to call a halt - the covers are held on by button head screws so tight they feel like they have been hit with a strong threadlocker. Heat (soldering iron) or maybe impact driver or both required.

You may have said so, but my head is a mess so here goes again. Can you say if your machine single phase? Do i recall your saying it&apos;s pretty adequately powered? If it is OK, what&apos;s the heaviest/most power hungry work you do on it?

What you say about single phase machines using an on board inverter is interesting Brian. I wonder just how feasible it may be to DIY upgrade these machines to larger motors, or to switch them to three phase? Or whether it&apos;s as simple as buying a new motor and inverter, and wiring it through the switches. There&apos;s braking and stuff that presumably would complicate the issue?

There&apos;s times in this stuff where i start to wonder if i&apos;m losing it or not. It doesn&apos;t seem unreasonable to me to select a machine based on catalogue/factory information, but makers in general in woodwork seem to be so loose about this sort of thing.

Anyway. It&apos;ll be interesting to hear from the factory.... ondablade Occasional Poster

 Most single phase motors these days only go to 4hp, if you want more than this on a Felder you&apos;ll need the electronic inverter fitted to take you to 5.5hp, which as you&apos;ve discovered is an optional extra which includes speed control. woodworker Occasional Poster

 Re: Hammer K3 Perform Panel Saw Spec

 I can still recall the brain ache I suffered trying to sort out specs with Hammer What I have is a single phase C3 41 in my home shop along with a single phase 4400 and a 3 phase 3m Perform Panel saw at work work. Don&apos;t even dream of trying to change anything once the order has gone to the factory - it&apos;s beyond them 

Power has not been an issue for me on any machine. I tend to use the panel saw for thinner stuff so it&apos;s never been really tested but the Universal certainly has. Obviously it depends on what you need to do and, no doubt, it will not keep up with a Wadkin rip saw, but I do rip down a lot of 75mm Douglas fir which is sticky and don&apos;t have a problem providing you are working sensibly. Yes if you were doing that all day you would benefit from more power but most people are not. What I do like is the engineering on the saw mechanism which is top drawer (for the price) and light years ahead of the Robland range.

The electrical situation is confusing. The capacitor converter does appear to work and does not seem to require any additional kit and the motors are reputed to be 3 phase. We really need the input from a top spark here which I am not. If that is correct it would seem likely that with a change of switchgear you could run on 3 phase supply with more power on the same motors. You do, of course, require a decent supply as the single phase setup draws about 60A on start-up (As measured by Scottish Power when our lights dimmed:D ) and needs a 16A supply with a slow blow trip Cheers

 Thank you for that Brian. My focus (and heaven knows where it will go) is cabinetry and &apos;artistic&apos; stuff, and not heavy cutting like e.g. window and door joinery.

There will be less frequent (?) heavy rip cuts and the like in hardwoods for legs and stuff as well as lighter cuts in sheet and strip material - i&apos;m eyeing up the possibility of designs with a sculptural element which means starting from fairly chunky material. But since there presumably won&apos;t be too many to do, and since careful and largely custom work seems likely to be the norm anyway slightly slower cutting might not be the end of the world - your feedback on the single phase C3 41 sounds promising. Borderline power with bogging down etc won&apos;t do however - and i&apos;m mindful that on the face of it running a 12 in blade is likely to require something approaching +20% power and torque compared to the 3hp 10in dia i have experience of.

It&apos;ll all be a bit moot if it turns out that 4kW is simply not available and never has been in single phase on the K3 Perform, and that upgrading it is not practicable. I&apos;m thinking the fall back (re. the bandsaw/resaw thread) may be a properly arranged 3phase industrial bandsaw on a converter/inverter. (most used larger bandsaws available round here are 3 phase) It&apos;s starting to look like i may need to buy one given the deep ripping and re-sawing limitations (thinking of solid door panels, drawer bottoms and the like) i&apos;ve run into on my current bandsaw

Maybe this could become the ripping tool of choice (?) Trouble is I don&apos;t have the experience to judge how feasible this is.

3-4hp indeed seems to be the upper limit by normal single phase woodworking machine standards WW. That said up to 5HP motors seem readily available off the shelf here in single phase from motor suppliers, with a bit larger to order. i.e. easily obtained by an OEM.

The start up surge (current/amps draw) is usually the limiting factor in deciding how large a single phase motor is feasible in woodworking situations, but in my electrically inexpert and inexperienced mind i rationalised that since the factory literature said 4kW single phase that it must be so, and that the factory had maybe added some fancy electronics to the saw to control the start up surge. (e.g. an inverter achieves this by delaying the ramping of the rpm)

So while I knew it wasn&apos;t typical of other makers it didn&apos;t sound impossible to me.

I thought i&apos;d found the answer to the maiden&apos;s prayer in the K3 Perform, with the result that the apparent availability of 4kW in single phase was a big part of my decision to remain on single phase when upgrading the workshop after selling my Robland combo...

 Initial switch-on surge is not that big a deal per se as it is only (or should be) a momentary surge. More critical is the size of power conductors feeding it. If the conductors are too small (sounds as if Brian found that out!) then the switch on surge current will:

cause a large voltage drop down the cable which in turn means:
less volts at the motor to fire it up which in turn means:
that it is taking the starting current for longer which in turn means:
there is a danger of over-heating the motor.

My Sedgwick MB has a listed switch-on surge of 80A. I only have a 4mm cable feeding the workshop (installed way before I got into this woodworking malarkey). My saving grace is that our house is fed by a transformer on a pole and my nominal voltage in the workshop is 252v and this drops to 228v on switch on and so well within the specs for the machine. The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time.

 If the order confirmation says 3kw then you got what you ordered I&apos;m afraid. I had a BF6-31 for years which had single phase, 3HP motors (these were uprated to 4HP for the later 7 series, which came out before mine was delivered, and at a cheaper price - try that for feeling pissed off!). I did loads of work on it and it was only the spindle moulder that felt underpowered at times. If it&apos;s predominantly furniture you&apos;re planning on making, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed.

Thereby hangs a tale! When I complained about poor supply they measured the voltage drop to 185V!! When this in turn was investigated it transpired that the builder had tapped in to the street lamp supply by twisting the tails together and covering with insulating tape (this was 1969). The EEC regulation only allows about 5% below 220V IIRC so the outcome was a complete new supply from the sub-station 1/4 mile away. I live in a fairly isolated location and it must have cost a fortune with 4 vans, digger and cable laying lorry for a week. Thank you Scottish Power as I now have 3 ph as far as the meter but all my kit is single phase. 

I think for furniture making 4HP single phase will be OK. I&apos;m not sure where you are but you are welcome to call in for a test session with your hardest Oak. Cheers

 Re: Hammer K3 Perform Panel Saw Spec

 Thanks for the info TNAF. As luck would have it my supply is pretty good as the transformer is fairly local to me too, and was i gather fairly recently upgraded due to extra houses being built. I suppose in the end that having the right cabling minimises the consequences of the surge.

That was a bit of a bummer on your machine spec John. No question but that i should have checked the confirmation more carefully. It wasn&apos;t like i didn&apos;t, but i over looked the kW issue in the confirmation because a couple of months + passed between doing the research/selecting the machine (based on the literature, and verbals) and checking the quote in detail before placing the order. I basically spent a few weeks heavily immersed on saw selection, but by two months later had forgotten the minutiae. My focus by then was more to make sure all the agreed (as opposed to standard) items were included, as the negotiation was quite difficult.

That there should be a conflict between the consistently published information (against which the machine was sold) and the eventual paperwork must carry considerable weight though.

This kind of scene gets up my nose too Brian - i&apos;ve already described how the understanding that the saw came with 4kW was a very big factor in my decision to stay single phase. The point is that quite small technicalities can have had quite major consequences - especially at the level of the not so highly expert one man shop that depends a lot on advice, and where funds to rectify errors are limited...

I&apos;m heading off for a week in the morning, but will update when i can and have information. Thank you all for your help....

Oh, how stupid of me Not really a useful analogy, Jake. When you order a machine, they send you a list of every component and option with a request that you check to make sure all is correct. If/when you are happy, you sign a copy and send it to them. This has to happen before any money changes hands and definitely before an order is sent to the factory. I&apos;m as critical as anyone when it comes to Felder&apos;s admin/sales but I don&apos;t know what else they could do in this case. Ask,&quot;are you sure you have checked everything like you have signed to say you have?&quot;? With every machine being custom made, it&apos;s obviously important to make sure you&apos;re both singing from the same hymn sheet and this is the, very reasonable in my view, mechanism to take care of that. Not that I&apos;m knocking Ian for making an understandable mistake. The standard Perform saw has power at 5.5HP and motor is 3 phase. Single phase is a cost option but it doesn&apos;t say anywhere that the 240v version comes with 4HP power but, in any case, as has already been said, it&apos;s probably the same motor with the loss of power consequent to the inverter being used. It will, though, have been made clear on the order confirmation as confirmed by Ian.

 But it doesn&apos;t, John. When I looked at the configurator, I selected single phase and the more powerful motor..which was marked as Standard. The only extra you have to pay is if you go for the 7.5 HP motor as far as I can see.

 Roger, there is a massive difference between the online configurator and the order confirmation that is sent out after a deposit is paid.

As John pointed out, Felder send out a detailed order confirmation letter showing every option, the price, delivery estimates, payment requirements etc, and request that you either sign and return the letter to confirm the order if everything is as it should be, or failing that, after 14 days without contact it is considered confirmed. Any discrepancies should be made known to them within that time.

Now we are all liable to make mistakes, but if the order confirmation that was signed or not contested, says the saw ordered will come with a 4HP motor, then I can&apos;t see there being much room for complaint. I still believe that there is an error in the literature, and lots of them, because (and this is based on assumptions I admit) Hammer is the lowest end of the spectrum produced by Felder, and if they don&apos;t offer a 5.5HP motor in single phase on the 500 or 700 series (which they don&apos;t) then why would they offer it on hobby/light trade machines and not on their more industrial models? davyowen Site Admin   Posts: 1498 Joined: Fri Sep 28, 2007 12:19 pm Location: Port Toilet, South Wales, UK

 FWIW I have an old 3 phase B3 and there are 3 phase 4hp motors fitted.

Brian - I believe that they may be using a&quot;Steinmetz connection&quot;(or variation of) such as shown at the end of this doc, but would be interested in seeing how they have connected your motors if you have a wiring diagram...

 Hi guys. We&apos;ve arrived and i couldn&apos;t resist looking in on what&apos;s become an interesting topic. I&apos;ll be quick as i&apos;m supposed to be on hols, and will be killed if caught on line ...

Some thoughts on what&apos;s been said.

I&apos;m less than happy at myself for missing the issue, but that said it surely cannot be the case that a manufacturer of standard equipment with only a small number of options sold off a catalogue can unilaterally negate the entire context of a sale and associated agreement (the catalogue and the negotiations) by a typo or whatever change buried in an order confirmation document - especially when that change (a 3kW motor) relates to something that is not according to the published literature even an option.

The law is often an ass, and that approach might appeal to a bureaucrat, but it certainly wouldn&apos;t be fair. My sense is that if that was permitted then chaos would quickly follow.

On motor HP. Why should the K3 Perform as the top of the range full size panel saw not have as large or larger a motor than some Felder machines? Motor sizing is about function, and the Perform is (unlike the other saws in the Hammer range) very specifically pitched as &apos;Perform - the powerful Hammer line, perfectly suited for the constant demand of daily use in various trades and industries&apos;. The K700S Felder is available with a 3.6kW motor....

Not withstanding all of this it&apos;s surely not going to come down to detail legalities. I bought three machines at the same time, and must constitute a good customer. I&apos;ve bought accessories since. In the meantime i&apos;m confident that a company with the reputation of these guys is unlikely to seek to turn the whole thrust of a deal on its head over something like this - where in the first instance the literature is pretty clearly at the root the problem, and in the second all concerned have acted in good faith.

The practicality is the matter of what may be reasonably available or not. If 4Kw can be provided relatively painlessly in single phase then it&apos;s (barring major technical barriers) a no brainer to sort out. If not, then it&apos;s a matter for co-operative discussion to figure something else out. The point here is simply not to be left with a saw that will struggle on reasonably paced full depth cuts in hardwood.. ondablade Occasional Poster

Why not? Put yourself in their position. They have a piece of paper signed by you to say you agree to everything. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to say it&apos;s &apos;buried&apos; anywhere since it will have been made perfectly clear. There is no &apos;small-print&apos; aspect to this. Having stuck the boot into Felder on many occasions, I find myself in the unusual position of defending them on this.

 ondablade wrote: perfectly suited for the constant demand of daily use in various trades and industries&apos;. 

........with the standard offering requiring three phase power which is expected in an industrial setting. You don&apos;t tend to get powerful, single-phase motors which is why people often go to a lot of trouble and expense to arrange a 3 phase supply. If anything, the sales person was lacking in not explaining the pros and cons of single phase/three phase and the power hit you would have to take if opting for single phase.

But, and I hope you don&apos;t mind me saying this, you could spend a lot more time doing and less time worrying about what is almost certainly a non-issue. I made tons of stuff on my 3HP Felder. I only upgraded because I moved to a bigger workshop with space for a larger slider and to take advantage of the three phase supply which was one of the attractions of the workshop in the first place. Since you do not have a three phase supply, the Felder solution is pretty good value since you would pay a lot more for for a suitable converter which would, incidentally, result in a loss of power anyway. On the plus side, it will probably hold its value better since the single phase version will be less common second-hand.

 I&apos;m sure Felder will sort something out, but it probably will not be a new motor. I would guess that they would offer you something as a goodwill gesture, perhaps some accessories or blades. But as mentioned, the basic fact that can&apos;t be avoided is that you had a chance to check the spec, and you didn&apos;t. I hope you don&apos;t think I am having a go at you, but on a very expensive order, I can&apos;t understand why you wouldn&apos;t have checked everything. I know when I ordered the KF700 I read the entire spec about 6 times, then left it a day and then checked it twice more. The motor is almost always the very first item on the list so I think you&apos;ll struggle to argue that it was &apos;buried&apos;.

And going back to why the Hammer should have it, and the Felder 500&amp;700 series shouldn&apos;t, well I can&apos;t think of any reason for it. Regardless of whether its the biggest in the Hammer range, the Hammer range is the lowest in the overall Felder range, and if anyone needs the extra power it will be those people who need the extra accuracy and durability of the 500/700 series but who aren&apos;t fortunate enough to have 3-phase. Which is why I point out that it would be strange for Felder to offer it on a light trade machine, and not the industrial machines.

And yes the KF700 comes with a 3.6kw motor, but it is a £900 optional extra. davyowen Site Admin   Posts: 1498 Joined: Fri Sep 28, 2007 12:19 pm Location: Port Toilet, South Wales, UK

 I wouldn&apos;t lose any more sleep over it and, believe me, if you take up issues with Felder/Hammer you will. There is also a difference in the response to problems depending on whether it&apos;s Felder of Hammer which, while it is understandable, is disappointing

So long as you have a decent supply the 4HP single phase motor will do everything you need for furniture making.

I&apos;ll post my wiring diagram later so that we can bottom the motor electrics issue. Cheers

 Thanks for all the views guys. Time will I guess tell. I&apos;m not chasing some sort of recompense, only to make sure I&apos;m not left with a saw that won&apos;t don&apos;t my work and the reports of good experience with similar sized saws are encouraging. The choice of single phase was quite deliberate in my case though - 4kW motors are widely available in single phase, and i made the decision to go with the Perform in light of the published fact that it was supplied with a 4kW motor.

The K3 Perform seems to suffer from being regarded as a cheapie DIY option. It&apos;s not that at something over £5,000. That&apos;s quite a bit less than the K700, but the latter has a considerably higher mechanical spec, so there&apos;s no reason to think that the savings in the K3 don&apos;t leave room for a decent motor at that price.

It seems very unlikely that there could have been an attempt to mess me around, the situation is surely the result of some sort of genuine crossing of the wires. But the fact remains that multiple sources in the literature on which the deal was based list 4kW as standard.

As before i&apos;ll fall on my sword, do penance, be more careful next time or whatever over the 3kW on the confirmation if it&apos;ll help - despite carefully reading it the 3kW slipped past me. But i didn&apos;t create the perception that the stock motor was 4kW, and the expectation that the documents would automatically reflect this - and i didn&apos;t issue the document.

It clear that some organisations would dive for the fine print/legalities in this situation, but as before that seems rather more short sighted than is wise in this business. Not to mention that it would ignore integrity and goodwill, not to mention the reality of the deal.

Finally if it actually was to come down to legalities. I&apos;m no legal eagle, and i could be off base - but i seem to recall from years ago that while implied terms in a contract (e.g. those in this case brought into being by the literature) are normally outweighed by express terms (e.g. those in any subsequent written contract), that there is law which specifically excludes this in the case of claims made in sales literature.... ondablade Occasional Poster

 I&apos;m not sure if you will get much out of Felder, if you signed the order for the 3kW Perform I can not see that they will be legally obliged to do anything. The confusion comes from them spec&apos;ing everything as 3 phase, in my catalogue there is one single phase option (3kW) and two 3 phase options at 4 and 5.5kW.

But for furniture I can&apos;t see that you will have a problem with the machine, I&apos;ve only got single phase in the workshop and had to go for a 3kW Felder K700, and with the right blade it will easily cut through 4&quot;oak. If I was cutting this sort of timber all day long then a more powerful motor would be better, but for occasional use it is no problem.
