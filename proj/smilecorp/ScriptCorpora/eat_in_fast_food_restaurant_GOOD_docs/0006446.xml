The New Jersey Senate was established as the upper house of the New Jersey Legislature by the Constitution of 1844, replacing the Legislative Council. From 1844 until 1965 New Jersey&apos;s counties elected one Senator, each. Under the 1844 Constitution the term of office was three years. The 1947 Constitution changed the term to four years. Since 1968 it has consisted of 40 Senators, who are elected in a &quot;2-4-4&quot; cycle, representing districts with average populations of 210,359 (2000 figures). The &quot;2-4-4&quot; cycle was put into place so that Senate elections can reflect the changes made to the district boundaries on the basis of the decennial United States Census. (If the cycle were not put into place, then the boundaries would sometimes be four years out of date before being used for Senate elections. Rather, with the varied term, the boundaries are only two years out of date). Thus elections for Senate seats take place in years ending with a &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot; or &quot;7&quot; (i.e. next elections in 2011, 2013 and 2017).

He organized the famous Army of the Potomac and served briefly (November 1861 to March 1862) as the general-in-chief of the Union Army. Early in the war, McClellan played an important role in raising a well-trained and organized army for the Union. Although McClellan was meticulous in his planning and preparations, these characteristics may have hampered his ability to challenge aggressive opponents in a fast-moving battlefield environment. He chronically overestimated the strength of enemy units and was reluctant to apply principles of mass, frequently leaving large portions of his army unengaged at decisive points.

James II&amp;VII (14 October 1633–16 September 1701) was King of England and King of Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685. He was the last Catholic monarch to reign over the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Increasingly Britain&apos;s political and religious leaders opposed him as too pro-French, too pro-Catholic, and too much of an absolute monarch. When he produced a Catholic heir, the tension exploded and the leaders called on William III of Orange (his son-in-law and nephew) to land an invasion army from the Netherlands. James fled England (and thus abdicated) in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was replaced by William of Orange who became king as William III, ruling jointly with his wife (James&apos;s daughter) Mary II. Thus William and Mary, both Protestants, became joint rulers in 1689. James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns, when he landed in Ireland in 1689 but, after the defeat of the Jacobite forces by the Williamite forces at the Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690, James returned to France. He lived out the rest of his life as a pretender at a court sponsored by his cousin and ally, King Louis XIV.

The terms Non-Hispanic Whites or White, Not Hispanic refers to people in the United States, as defined by the Census Bureau, who are of the white race but not of Hispanic or Latino origin/ethnicity. They are of white race from colonial origin, Europe, North Africa, Middle East, South Asia,Canada, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans are white; like the overall non-Hispanic population of the United States, Hispanics and Latinos can be of any race: white, black, Asian, etc, as race and ethnicity are considered independent of each other. Since the population of descendants of people from Spain in the United States is vastly outnumbered by those from Spain&apos;s former colonies, the Non-Hispanic White category can also be effectively used to give a good estimate of the directly descended European population in the United States (European Americans).

 New Jersey ( i / n uː ˈ dʒ ɜr z i / ) is a state in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by the U.S. state of New York , on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean , on the west by Pennsylvania , and on the southwest by Delaware . New Jersey is the 4th least extensive , but the 11th most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States . New Jersey lies mostly within the sprawling metropolitan areas of New York City and Philadelphia . It is also the third wealthiest by 2009–2010 median household income . [ 7 ] 

The area was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements. [ 8 ] The British later seized control of the region, [ 9 ] naming it the Province of New Jersey . It was granted as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . At this time, it was named after the largest of the British Channel Islands , Jersey , Carteret&apos;s birthplace. [ 10 ] New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary War .

In the 19th century, factories in cities such as Elizabeth , Paterson , and Trenton helped to drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey&apos;s position at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast, and Philadelphia, Baltimore , and Washington, D.C. to the southwest, fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the 1950s and beyond.

New Jersey is bordered on the north and northeast by New York (parts of which are across the Hudson River , Upper New York Bay , the Kill Van Kull , Newark Bay , and the Arthur Kill ); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by Delaware across Delaware Bay ; and on the west by Pennsylvania across the Delaware River .

New Jersey can be thought of as five regions, based on natural geography and population. Northeastern New Jersey, the Gateway Region , lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area , and some residents commute into the city to work. Northwestern New Jersey, or the &quot; Skylands &quot;, is, compared to the northeast, more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The &quot; Shore &quot;, along the Atlantic Coast in the central-east and southeast, has its own natural, residential, and lifestyle characteristics owing to its location by the ocean. The Delaware Valley includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area . The fifth region is the Pine Barrens in the interior of the southern part. Covered rather extensively by mixed pine and oak forest, it has a much lower population density than much of the rest of the state.

New Jersey also can be broadly divided into three geographic regions: North Jersey , Central Jersey , and South Jersey . Some New Jersey residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right, but others believe it is a separate geographic and cultural area from the North and South.

The federal Office of Management and Budget divides New Jersey&apos;s counties into seven Metropolitan Statistical Areas , including sixteen counties in the New York City or Philadelphia metro areas. Four counties have independent metro areas, and Warren County is part of the Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley metro area. (See Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey for details.)

It is also at the center of the Northeast megalopolis .

Additionally, the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Growth,&amp;Tourism Commission divides the state into six distinct regions to facilitate the state&apos;s tourism industry. The regions are:

 Gateway Region , encompassing Middlesex County , Union County , Essex County , Hudson County , Bergen County , and Passaic County . Skylands Region , encompassing Sussex County , Morris County , Warren County , Hunterdon County , and Somerset County . Shore Region , encompassing Monmouth County and Ocean County . Delaware River Region , encompassing Mercer County , Burlington County , Camden County , Gloucester County , and Salem County . Greater Atlantic City Region , encompassing Atlantic County . Southern Shore Region , encompassing Cumberland County and Cape May County . 

 High Point , in Montague Township , Sussex County , is the highest elevation, at 1,803 feet (550 m). The Palisades are a line of steep cliffs on the lower west side of the Hudson River .

Major rivers include the Hudson , Delaware , Raritan , Passaic , Hackensack , Rahway , Musconetcong , Mullica , Rancocas , Manasquan , Maurice , and Toms rivers.

 Sandy Hook , along the eastern coast, is a popular recreational beach. It is a barrier spit and an extension of the Barnegat Peninsula along the state&apos;s Atlantic Ocean coast.

 Long Beach Island (&quot;LBI&quot;), a barrier island along the eastern coast, has popular recreational beaches. The primary access point to the island is by a single bridge connection to the mainland. Barnegat Lighthouse is on the northern tip.

Areas managed by the National Park Service include:

 Appalachian National Scenic Trail Delaware National Scenic River Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Ellis Island National Monument Gateway National Recreation Area in Monmouth County Great Egg Harbor River Morristown National Historical Park in Morristown New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange 

Prominent geographic features include:

 Climate [link] 

As with many other geographic features, New Jersey&apos;s climate divides into regions. The south, central, and northeast parts of the state have a humid mesothermal climate, while the northwest has a humid continental climate ( microthermal ), with slightly cooler temperatures due to higher elevation. New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. [ 12 ] 

Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of 82–88 °F (28–31 °C) and lows of 60–70 °F (16–21 °C); however, temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average 25 days each summer, though rarely exceed 100 °F (38 °C) . Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of 38–46 °F (3–8 °C) and lows of 26–32 °F (-3–0 °C) for most of the state, but temperatures could, for brief interludes, be as low as 10–20 °F (-12–-7 °C) and sometimes rise to 50–60 °F (10–16 °C). Northwestern parts of the state have slightly colder winters with average temperatures just below freezing. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer. [ 13 ] 

Average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 51 inches (1,100 to 1,300 mm), uniformly spread through the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from 10–15 inches (25–38 cm) in the south and near the seacoast, 15–30 inches (38–76 cm) in the northeast and central part of the state, to about 40–50 inches (1.0–1.3 m) in the northwestern highlands, but this varies from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can in some years experience &quot; nor&apos;easters &quot;, which are capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. Hurricanes and tropical storms (such as Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999 [ 14 ] ), tornadoes , and earthquakes are rare.

 History [link] 
 Main article: History of New Jersey 
Around 180 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period , New Jersey bordered North Africa. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains . Around 18,000 years ago, the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic , as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges. [ 16 ] 

New Jersey was originally settled by Native Americans, with the Lenni-Lenape being dominant at the time Europeans arrived. The Lenape were loosely organized groups that practiced small-scale agriculture (mainly based on corn ) in order to increase their largely mobile hunter-gatherer society in the region surrounding the Delaware River , the lower Hudson River , and western Long Island Sound . The Lenape society was divided into matrilinear clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign: Turtle, Turkey , and Wolf . They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through fur trade .

 Colonial era [link] 
 Main article: Colonial history of New Jersey 
New Jersey was first claimed by the Dutch. The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of modern Middle Atlantic states. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape , Dutch West India Company policy required their colonists to purchase land which they settled. The first to do so was Michiel Pauw who established a patronship named Pavonia along the North River which eventually became the Bergen . Peter Minuit &apos;s purchase of lands along the Delaware River establish the colony of New Sweden . The entire region became a territory of England in 1664, when an English fleet under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is today New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam , annexing the entire province.

During the English Civil War the Channel Island of Jersey remained loyal to the Crown and gave sanctuary to the King. It was from the Royal Square in St. Helier that Charles II of England was first proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, Charles I . The North American lands were divided by Charles II , who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later King James II ), the region between New England and Maryland as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony ). James then granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the English Civil War : Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton . The area was named the Province of New Jersey .
 The campuses of Rutgers University (originally chartered as Queen&apos;s College in 1766) include buildings of a variety of architectural styles. 
Since the state&apos;s inception, New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity. New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of 100 acres (40 ha), a few rich proprietors owned vast estates. English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings. Unlike Plymouth Colony , Jamestown and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and commercial farming only developed sporadically. Some townships, such as Burlington on the Delaware River and Perth Amboy , emerged as important ports for shipping to New York and Philadelphia. The colony&apos;s fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers, and New Jersey boasted a population of 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule was along Hackensack River and Arthur Kill and settlers came primarily from New England. Unlike other colonies that were settled by immigrants from Europe, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of settlement from communities already established on the North American continent. March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to Quakers in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony. ( William Penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time.) New Jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces, East and West Jersey , for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, at times part of the Province of New York or Dominion of New England .

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a royal, rather than a proprietary, governor. Edward Hyde , Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738. [ 17 ] 

 Revolutionary War era [link] 
 Main article: New Jersey during the American Revolution 
New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution . The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain . It was an act of the Provincial Congress, which made itself into the state Legislature. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain.

New Jersey representatives Richard Stockton , John Witherspoon , Francis Hopkinson , John Hart , and Abraham Clark were among those who signed the United States Declaration of Independence .

During the American Revolutionary War , British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is often referred to as &quot;The Crossroads of the Revolution.&quot; The winter quarters of the revolutionary army were established there twice by General George Washington in Morristown , which was called the military capital of the revolution.

On December 25, 1776, the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River . After the crossing, he surprised and defeated the unprepared Hessian troops in the Battle of Trenton . Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton , on January 3, 1777, American forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis&apos;s charges at the Second Battle of Trenton . By evading Cornwallis&apos;s army, Washington made a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated the British forces there. Emanuel Leutze &apos;s painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware became an icon of the Revolution.

American forces under Washington met the forces under General Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington attempted to take the British column by surprise; when the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Americans retreated in disorder. The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges.

In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton University , making Princeton the nation&apos;s capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783) , which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution , which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey, as it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging and keeping tariffs on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the Bill of Rights .

The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote to &quot;all inhabitants&quot; who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and blacks, but not married women, because they could not own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of &quot;petticoat electors&quot; (entitled to vote or not); on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage, excluding paupers. (This was less revolutionary than it sounds: the &quot;constitution&quot; was itself only an act of the legislature.) [ 18 ] 

 19th century [link] 
 Main article: New Jersey in the 19th century 
On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual scale-down of the slave population. By the close of the Civil War about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen . New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States&apos; black population.

In 1844, the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the State Senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of Mercer County ) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1962 by the decision Baker v. Carr . While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

Unlike the Revolutionary War, no Civil War battles took place within the state. However, throughout the course of the Civil War, over 80,000 from New Jersey enlisted in the Northern army to defeat the Southern Confederacy .

New Jersey was one of the few Northern states (the others being Delaware and Kentucky ) to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national elections, and sided with Stephen Douglas (1860) and George B. McClellan (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan later became governor (1878–81). During the Civil War, the state was led first by Republican Governor Charles Smith Olden , then by Democrat Joel Parker .

In the Industrial Revolution , cities like Paterson grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been granted 1,093 patents , many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison&apos;s facilities, first at Menlo Park and then in West Orange , are considered perhaps the first research centers in the U.S. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey.

 Iron mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. Bog iron pits in the Southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources of iron for the new nation. [ 19 ] Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the Morris Canal . Zinc mines were also a major industry, especially the Sterling Hill Mine .

 20th century [link] 
 Main article: New Jersey in the 20th century The Statue of Liberty and Jersey City 
Through both World Wars, New Jersey was a center for war production, especially in naval construction. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were all made in this state. In addition, Fort Dix (1917) (originally called &quot;Camp Dix&quot;), [ 20 ] Camp Merritt (1917) [ 21 ] and Camp Kilmer (1941) [ 22 ] were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both World Wars. New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the Cold War . Fourteen Nike Missile stations were constructed, especially for the defense of New York City and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania. PT-109 , a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy in World War II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne. The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped. [ 23 ] In 1962, the world&apos;s first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the NS Savannah , was launched at Camden.

New Jersey prospered through the Roaring Twenties . The first Miss America Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City, the first drive-in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden, and the Holland Tunnel opened in 1927. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents, [ 24 ] the zeppelin airship Hindenburg crashed in flames over Lakehurst , and the SS Morro Castle beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea.

In 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike opened, permitting fast travel by car and truck between North Jersey (and metropolitan New York) and South Jersey (and metropolitan Philadelphia).

In the 1960s, race riots erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey. The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964. Several others ensued in 1967, in Newark and Plainfield . Other riots followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, just as in the rest of the country. A riot occurred in Camden in 1971.

As a result of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably, the New Jersey legislature reluctantly passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax. [ 25 ] 

 21st century [link] 

Originally competing at Giants Stadium before moving to adjacent MetLife Stadium in 2010, the Giants and Jets franchises felt the Meadowlands and its sports venues were outdated by today&apos;s professional sports standards. This also led to the Devils&apos; relocation from the Izod Center to the Prudential Center in Newark at the start of the 2007–08 season. The Brooklyn Nets , also formerly based at the Izod Center, left for the Prudential Center in 2010 for two NBA seasons. The team then relocated to Brooklyn, New York at the Barclays Center for the 2012–13 season.

 New Jersey population distribution 
 State population [link] 

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of New Jersey was 8,821,155 on July 1, 2011, a 0.33% increase since the 2010 United States Census . [ 4 ] Residents of New Jersey are most commonly referred to as &quot;New Jerseyans&quot; or &quot;New Jerseyites&quot;. As of the census [ 27 ] of 2010 [update] , there were 8,791,894 people residing in the state. The racial makeup of the state was 68.6% White , 13.7% African American , 0.3% Native American , 8.3% Asian , 6.4% from other races , and 2.7% from two or more races. 17.7% of the population were Hispanic or Latino . Non-Hispanic Whites were 59.3% of the population in 2010, [ 28 ] down from 85% in 1970. [ 29 ] 

The United States Census Bureau , as of July 1, 2009  ( 2009 -07-01 ) [update] , estimated New Jersey&apos;s population at 8,707,739, [ 30 ] which represents an increase of 268,301, or 3.2%, since the last census in 2000. [ 31 ] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 343,965 people (that is, 933,185 births minus 589,220 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 53,930 people out of the state. [ 31 ] Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 384,687 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 438,617 people. [ 31 ] As of 2005 [update] , there were 1.6 million foreign-born living in the state (accounting for 19.2% of the population). [ 32 ] 

As of 2010, New Jersey is the eleventh-most populous state in the United States, and the most densely populated, at 1,185 residents per square mile (458 per km 2 ), with most of the population residing in the counties surrounding New York City, Philadelphia, and along the eastern Jersey Shore , while the extreme southern and northwestern counties are relatively less dense overall. It is also the second wealthiest state according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ 33 ] 

The center of population for New Jersey is located in Middlesex County , in the town of Milltown , just east of the New Jersey Turnpike . [ 34 ] 

New Jersey is home to more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere else in the world. [ 35 ]

It has the second largest Jewish population by percentage (after New York); [ 36 ] the second largest Muslim population by percentage (after Michigan ); the largest population of people from Costa Rica in the United States; the largest population of Cubans outside of Florida; the third highest Asian population by percentage; and the third highest Italian population by percentage according to the 2000 Census . African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos , and Arabs are also high in number. It has the third highest Indian population of any state by absolute numbers. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] It has the third largest Korean population, fourth largest Filipino population, and fourth largest Chinese population, per the 2000 U.S. Census. The five largest ethnic groups are: Italian (17.9%), Irish (15.9%), African (13.6%), German (12.6%), Polish (6.9%).

 Newark is the fourth poorest city in America, [ 41 ] but New Jersey as a whole has the second highest median household income. [ 42 ] This is largely because so much of New Jersey consists of suburbs, most of them affluent, of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey is also the most densely populated state, and the only state that has had every one of its counties deemed &quot;urban&quot; as defined by the Census Bureau &apos;s Combined Statistical Area . [ 43 ]

Metropolitan statistical areas and divisions of New Jersey ; counties shaded in blue hues belong to the New York City Metropolitan Area ; counties shaded in green hues are in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area . Mercer County is located in the Greater New York Metropolitan Area. Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland Counties are located in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. Warren County is considered part of the Lehigh Valley . 
The state has very sizable enclaves of different non-English-speaking communities. Some of these languages include:

 Spanish – spoken throughout the state. Italian – spoken throughout the state. Polish – spoken throughout the state. Gujarati – spoken throughout the state. Hindi – spoken throughout the state. Tagalog – spoken throughout the state. Mandarin Chinese – spoken throughout the state, most prominently in the northern and central counties. Korean – spoken prominently in Bergen County . Telugu – spoken prominently in Middlesex County and Hudson County . Tamil – spoken prominently in Middlesex County and Hudson County. Malayalam – spoken prominently in Bergen County. Portuguese – spoken prominently in the Ironbound section of Newark . Turkish – spoken prominently in the Little Istanbul section of Paterson . Russian – spoken prominently in the Fair Lawn borough of Bergen County. 

Each county&apos;s largest ethnic group, according to the 2000 Census, is:

 Italian — Passaic, Bergen, Union, Hudson, Morris, Somerset, Middlesex, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic, Cumberland [ 40 ] Irish — Sussex, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Cape May [ 40 ] German — Warren, Hunterdon, Salem [ 40 ] 

6.7% of its population was reported as under age 5, 24.8% under 18, and 13.2% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 51.5% of the population.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census , 12.31% of the population aged 5 and over speak Spanish at home, while 1.12% speak Italian, 1.03% speak Portuguese, and 1.02% speak Tagalog (Filipino). [ 46 ] 

In 2010, illegal immigrants constituted an estimated 6.4% of the population. This was the fourth highest percentage of any state in the country. [ 47 ] [ 48 ]

 Economy [link] 
 The New Jersey State Quarter, released in 1999, with a depiction of Washington Crossing the Delaware . 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Jersey&apos;s gross state product in 2010 was $487 billion. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] As of January 2012 [update] , the state&apos;s unemployment rate is 9%. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] 

 Affluence [link] 

Its per capita gross state product in 2008 was $54,699, 2nd in the U.S. and above the national per capita gross domestic product of $46,588. [ 55 ] Its per-capita income was the third highest in the nation with $51,358. [ 55 ] The state also has the highest percentage of millionaire households. [ 56 ] It is ranked 2nd in the nation by the number of places with per capita incomes above national average with 76.4%. Nine of New Jersey&apos;s counties are in the wealthiest 100 of the country.

 Fiscal policy [link] 

New Jersey has seven tax brackets for determining income tax rates. The rates range from 1.4 to 8.97%. The standard sales tax rate is 7%, applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law. Exemptions include most food items for at-home preparation, medicines, clothing (except fur items), footwear, and disposable paper products for use in the home. Approximately 30 New Jersey municipalities are designated as Urban Enterprise Zones and shoppers are charged a 3½% tax rate, half of the rate charged outside the UEZs. Sections of Elizabeth and Jersey City are examples of communities that are subject to the lower sales tax rate. New Jersey has the highest tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of $68 billion in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of $7,816 at a rate of 12.9% of income. [ 57 ] All real property located in the state is subject to property tax unless specifically exempted by statute. New Jersey does not assess an intangible personal property tax, but it does impose an inheritance tax .

 Federal taxation disparity [link] 

New Jersey has the highest disparity of any state in the United States between what it gives to the federal government and what it receives. In fiscal year 2005, New Jersey taxpayers gave the federal government $77 billion, while only receiving $55 billion. This difference is higher than any other state and means that for every $1 New Jersey taxpayers send to Washington, the state only receives $0.61 in return. This calculation is applied correctly after making the federal government deficit neutral, as sometimes the federal government spends more than it receives. [ 58 ] As of 2005 [update] , New Jersey has never been above 48th in rank for per capita federal spending (with a rank of 50th for the majority of that time) since 1982, while being second or third in per capita federal taxes paid to Washington.

New Jersey runs into deficits frequently and has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation. [ 59 ] Factors for this include the large federal tax liability which is not adjusted for New Jersey&apos;s higher cost of living and Medicaid funding formulas. As shown by the study, incomes tend to be higher in New Jersey, which puts those in higher tax brackets especially vulnerable to the alternative minimum tax .

 Industries [link] 
 Cranberry harvest. 
New Jersey&apos;s economy is centered on the pharmaceutical industry, the financial industry, chemical development, telecommunications, food processing, electric equipment, printing and publishing, and tourism. New Jersey&apos;s agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products. New Jersey ranks second among states in blueberry production, third in cranberries and spinach , and fourth in bell peppers , peaches , and head lettuce . [ 60 ] New Jersey harvests the fourth-largest number of acres planted with asparagus. [ 61 ] 

Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy consumption is only 2.7% of the U.S. total, and its carbon dioxide emissions are only 0.8% of the U.S. total. Its comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to nuclear power. According to the Energy Information Administration , nuclear power dominates New Jersey’s electricity market, typically supplying more than one-half of State generation. New Jersey has three nuclear power plants, including the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station , which came online in 1969 and is the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country. [ 62 ] 

New Jersey has a strong scientific economy. New Jersey is home to major pharmaceutical firms such as Johnson and Johnson , Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis , Pfizer , Merck , Hoffman-LaRoche , and Bristol-Myers Squibb . New Jersey is home to major telecommunications firms such as Verizon Wireless , Avaya , Alcatel-Lucent and AT&amp;T Communications . Furthermore, New Jersey draws upon its large and well-educated labor pool which also supports the myriad of industries that exist today.

New Jersey is the ultimate bedroom community since the state is right next to New York City and Philadelphia. Thus, there is a strong service economy in New Jersey serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. Some of these industries include retail sales, education and real estate. Newark Liberty International Airport is ranked seventh among the nation&apos;s busiest airports and among the top 20 busiest airports in the world.

Shipping is a strong industry in New Jersey because of the state&apos;s strategic location, the Port of New York and New Jersey the busiest on the East Coast . The Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal was the world&apos;s first container port and is one of the world&apos;s largest container ports. New Jersey also has a strong presence in chemical development, refining, and food processing operations.

New Jersey hosts several business headquarters, including twenty-four Fortune 500 companies. [ 63 ] Paramus is noted for having one of the highest retail sales per person ratios in the nation. Several New Jersey counties such as Somerset (7), Morris (10), Hunterdon (13), Bergen (21), Monmouth (42) counties are ranked among the highest-income counties in the United States . Four others are also in the top 100.

 Natural resources [link] 

New Jersey&apos;s greatest natural resource is its location, which has made the state a crossroads of commerce. Other commercial advantages include its extensive transportation system, which puts one quarter of all United States consumers within overnight delivery range. Lake and seaside resorts such as Atlantic City have contributed to New Jersey&apos;s rank of fifth among the states in revenues from tourism.

Almost half of New Jersey is wooded. The chief tree of the northern forests is the oak. A large part of the southern section is in pine. Jersey oak has been used extensively in shipbuilding.

The mineral resources in New Jersey are small. The state, however, does rank high in smelting and refining minerals from other states. Some mining activity does still take place in the area in and around the Franklin Furnace , which was long a center of zinc production (see New Jersey Zinc Company ).

New Jersey is second in the nation in solar power installations, enabled by one of the country&apos;s most favorable net metering policies, and the renewable energy certificates program. The state has more than 10,000 solar installations. [ 64 ]

In 2010, there were 605 school districts in the state . [ 65 ] 

Secretary of Education Rick Rosenberg, appointed by Governor Jon Corzine , created the Education Advancement Initiative (EAI) to increase College admission rates by 10% for New Jersey&apos;s high school students, decrease dropout rates by 15%, and increase the amount of money devoted to schools by 10%. Rosenberg retracted this plan when criticized for taking the money out of healthcare to fund this initiative.

In 2010 the state government paid all of the teachers&apos; premiums for health insurance. [ 65 ] 

Census data reveal that New Jersey spent more per each public school student than any other state except New York in 2009, amounting to $16,271 spent per pupil, with 41% of the revenue derived from state sources. [ 66 ] 

According to 2011 Newsweek statistics, students of High Technology High School in Lincroft , Monmouth County and Bergen County Academies in Hackensack , Bergen County registered average SAT scores of 2145 and 2100, respectively, [ 67 ] representing the highest and second-highest scores, respectively, of all listed U.S. high schools.

 Map of New Jersey showing major transportation networks and cities The George Washington Bridge , connecting Fort Lee , Bergen County, New Jersey to Manhattan in New York City, is the world&apos;s busiest motor vehicle bridge. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] See also: List of New Jersey State Highways 
The New Jersey Turnpike is one of the best-known and most-trafficked roadways in the United States. This toll road carries interstate traffic between Delaware and New York, and the East Coast in general. Commonly referred to as simply &quot;the Turnpike,&quot; it is known for its numerous rest-areas named after prominent New Jerseyans as diverse as inventor Thomas Edison ; United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton ; United States Presidents Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson ; writers James Fenimore Cooper , Joyce Kilmer , and Walt Whitman ; patriot Molly Pitcher ; Red Cross advocate Clara Barton ; and football coach Vince Lombardi .

The Garden State Parkway , or simply &quot;the Parkway,&quot; carries more in-state traffic and runs from the town of Montvale along New Jersey&apos;s northern border to its southernmost tip at Cape May for 172.4 miles (277.5 km). It is the trunk that connects the New York metropolitan area to Atlantic City and is consistently one of the safest roads in the nation. With a total of 15 travel lanes and 6 shoulder lanes, the Driscoll Bridge on the Parkway, spanning the Raritan River in Middlesex County , is the widest motor vehicle bridge in the world by number of lanes [ 72 ] as well as one of the busiest.

New Jersey is connected to New York City via various bridges and tunnels. The George Washington Bridge at 300,000 vehicles per day carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of any bridge in the world [ 70 ] [ 71 ] from Fort Lee, New Jersey in Bergen County to the Washington Heights neighborhood in Upper Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway carrying I-95, US 1, and US 9. The Lincoln Tunnel connects to Midtown Manhattan carrying New Jersey State Route 495 and the Holland Tunnel connects to Lower Manhattan carrying I-78. These are the three major Hudson River crossings that see heavy vehicular traffic. New Jersey is also connected to Staten Island by three bridges. From the southernmost to northernmost; the Outerbridge Crossing , Goethals Bridge , and Bayonne Bridge .

Other expressways in New Jersey include the Atlantic City Expressway , the Palisades Interstate Parkway , Interstate 76 , Interstate 78 , Interstate 80 , Interstate 95 , Interstate 195 , Interstate 278 , Interstate 280 , Interstate 287 , Interstate 295 , and Interstate 676 . Other major roadways include U.S. 1 , U.S. 9 , New Jersey Route 17 , New Jersey Route 4 , and U.S. Route 46 .

New Jersey has interstate compacts with all three neighboring states. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , the Delaware River Port Authority (with Pennsylvania), and the Delaware River and Bay Authority (with Delaware) operate most of the major transportation routes into and out of New Jersey. Bridge tolls are collected in one direction only — it is free to cross into New Jersey, but motorists must pay when exiting the state. Exceptions to this are the Dingman&apos;s Ferry Bridge and the Delaware River – Turnpike Toll Bridge where tolls are charged both ways. The Washington Crossing and Scudders Falls (on I-95) bridges near Trenton, as well as Trenton&apos;s Calhoun Street and Bridge Street (&quot;Trenton Makes&quot;) bridges, are toll-free. In addition, * Riverton-Belvidere Bridge , Northampton Street Bridge , Riegelsville Bridge , and Upper Black Eddy-Milford Bridge are free Delaware River bridges into and out of NJ.

New Jersey is one of only two states (along with Oregon ) where all fuel dispensing stations are required to sell gasoline full-service to customers. It is unlawful for a customer to serve him/herself.

New Jersey&apos;s Highway Maintenance Program was rated &quot;Extremely Poor&quot; by Reason Foundation &apos;s &quot;17th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems.&quot;

 Airports [link] 
 New York City skyline from Continental Terminal C in Newark Liberty Airport . 
 Newark Liberty International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the United States. Operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which runs the other two major airports in the New York metropolitan area ( John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport ), it is one of the main airports serving the New York City area. Continental Airlines is the facility&apos;s largest tenant, operating an entire terminal at Newark, which it uses as one of its primary hubs . FedEx Express operates a large cargo hub. The adjacent Newark Airport railroad station provides access to the trains of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit along the Northeast Corridor Line .

Two smaller commercial airports, Atlantic City International Airport and Trenton-Mercer Airport , also operate in other parts of New Jersey. Teterboro Airport , in Bergen County , is a general aviation airport popular with private and corporate aircraft, due to its proximity to New York City. Millville Municipal Airport , in Cumberland County , is a general aviation airport popular with private and corporate aircraft, due to its proximity to the shore.

Two Hudson-Bergen Light Rail trains in Jersey City , New Jersey. 
The New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. NJ Transit is a state-run corporation that began with the consolidation of several private bus companies in North Jersey. In the early 1980s, it acquired the commuter train operations of Conrail that connect towns in northern and central New Jersey to New York City. NJ Transit has eleven lines that run throughout different parts of the state. Most of the trains start at various points in the state and most end at either Pennsylvania Station , in New York City, or Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken . NJ Transit began service between Atlantic City and Lindenwold in 1989 and extended it to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania, in the 1990s.

NJ Transit also operates three light rail systems in the state. The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail connects Bayonne to North Bergen , with planned expansion into Bergen County communities. The Newark Light Rail is the only subway system entirely in the state, but it is only partially underground. Its Main Line connects Newark Penn Station in Downtown Newark with outer parts of the city, ending at Grove Street station in Bloomfield . The Broad Street Line of the subway, the first component of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link , connects Newark Broad Street Station to Newark Penn Station . The last of the three light rail lines is the River Line which connects Trenton and Camden .

The PATH is a subway and above-ground railway which links Hoboken , Jersey City , Harrison and Newark with New York City. The PATH operates four lines that connect various points in North Jersey and New York. The lines all terminate in Hudson County , Essex County or Manhattan in New York City.

The PATCO High Speedline links Camden County and Philadelphia . PATCO operates a single elevated and subway line that runs from Lindenwold to Center City Philadelphia. PATCO operates stations in Lindenwold, Voorhees , Cherry Hill , Haddonfield , Haddon Township , Collingswood , and Camden , along with four stations in Philadelphia.

 Amtrak also operates numerous long-distance passenger trains in New Jersey to and from neighboring states and around the country. In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway stations include Trenton Rail Station , Metropark , and the grand historic Newark Penn Station .

 SEPTA also has two lines that operate into New Jersey. The Trenton Line terminates at the Trenton Transit Center , and the West Trenton Line terminates at the West Trenton Rail Station in Ewing .

 AirTrain Newark is a monorail connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the Northeast Corridor to the airport&apos;s terminals and parking lots.

Some private bus carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these carriers of which Coach USA companies make up the bulk. Other carriers include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from other parts of New Jersey, New York City, Philadelphia , and Delaware to the casino resorts of Atlantic City.

 Ferries [link] 

On the Delaware Bay , the Delaware River and Bay Authority operates the Cape May-Lewes Ferry . The agency also operates ferries between Fort Mott (New Jersey) and Fort Delaware and Fort DuPont in Delaware . The Delaware River Port Authority operates the RiverLink Ferry between the Camden waterfront and Penn&apos;s Landing in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania.

In the Port of New York and New Jersey , New York Waterway has ferry terminals at Belford Harbor , Jersey City , Hoboken and Weehawken , and Edgewater Landing . There are slips are at Port Liberte , Liberty Harbor, Exchange Place in Jersey City, Port Imperial and Lincoln Harbor in Weehawken, Hoboken Terminal and 14th Street in Hoboken.

 Governance [link] 
 Main article: Government of New Jersey Further information: Governor of New Jersey ,  Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey ,  New Jersey Legislature , and  2006 New Jersey State Government Shutdown 
 Executive [link] 

The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010 the governor was the only statewide elected office in the state appointed numerous government officials. Formerly, an Acting Governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as President of the New Jersey State Senate , thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. In 2002 and 2007, President of the State Senate Richard Codey held the position of Acting Governor for a short time, and from 2004 to 2006 Codey became a long-term Acting Governor due to Jim McGreevey &apos;s resignation. A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President from becoming Acting Governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senate. Chris Christie ( Republican ) is the Governor .

The governor&apos;s mansion is Drumthwacket , located in Princeton Township .

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor . Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and took office on January 19, 2010. She was elected on the Republican ticket with Governor-Elect Chris Christie in the November 2009 NJ gubernatorial election. The position was created as the result of a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution passed by the voters on November 8, 2005 and effective as of January 17, 2006.

 Legislative [link] 
 The New Jersey State House is topped by its golden dome in Trenton . 
The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature , consisting of an upper house Senate of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one State Senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; State Senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. (The others are Kentucky , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Virginia .) New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year. Thus, the last year when New Jersey elected a Governor was 2009; the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2013, with future gubernatorial elections to take place in 2017, 2021, 2025, etc.

 Judicial [link] 

The New Jersey Supreme Court [ 74 ] consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. All are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Courts , where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

New Jersey&apos;s judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity , like its neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U.S. states. The New Jersey Superior Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level.

The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division , which functions as the state&apos;s intermediate appellate court . Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a Tax Court , which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the Director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the Governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

 Counties [link] 
 Further information: List of New Jersey counties 
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently Union County in 1857. New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called &quot;Freeholders,&quot; governing each county as part of its own Board of Chosen Freeholders . The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other 5 counties ( Atlantic , Bergen , Essex , Hudson and Mercer ), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.

 Municipalities [link] 

New Jersey has 566 municipalities; the number was 567 before Pahaquarry Township was absorbed by Hardwick Township in 1997. Unlike states in the west and south, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor Jon Corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs. [ 75 ] In May 2009, the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission (LUARC) began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation. [ 76 ] 

 Types of government [link] 

When the types of government were devised in the 19th century, the intention was that cities would be large built-up areas, with progressively smaller boroughs , towns , and villages ; the rural areas in between would be relatively large townships . This is still often true, although Shrewsbury Township has been divided over the years; today it is less than a square mile, consisting only of a single housing development. Some townships — notably Brick , Hamilton , Middletown , and Toms River  — have, without changing their boundaries, become large stretches of suburbia , as populous as cities, often focused around shopping centers and highways rather than traditional downtowns and main streets.

Short Hills, Murray Hill, and many other locations in New Jersey are not municipalities but rather neighborhoods, with no exact boundaries. Often the cluster of houses, the traditional neighborhood, the postal district, and the Census designated place will differ.

 Forms of government [link]

The five types of municipality differ mostly in name. Originally, each type had its own form of government but more modern forms are available to any municipality, even though the original type is retained in its formal name. Only boroughs can (but are not required to) have the &quot;borough form&quot; of government.

Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the Walsh Act , enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature , which provided for a 3- or 5-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law , which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced Council-Manager government with an (ideally apolitical) appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The Faulkner Act , originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council , Council-Manager , Small Municipality , and Mayor-Council-Administrator . The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the Council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey&apos;s residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature .

While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government. The other three villages— Ridgefield Park (now with a Walsh Act form), Ridgewood (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and South Orange (now operates under a Special Charter )—have all migrated to other non-village forms.

 Social attitudes and issues [link] 

Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as pro-choice , although a majority are opposed to late trimester and Partial Birth Abortion and public funding of Abortion. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In a 2009 Quinnipiac University poll , a plurality supported same-sex marriage 49% to 43% opposed. [ 79 ] 

In April 2004, New Jersey enacted a domestic partnership law , which is available to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples aged 62 and over. During 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 that state lawmakers must provide the rights and benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian couples. Moreover, effective February 19, 2007, New Jersey became the third state in the U.S. (the other two being Connecticut and Vermont ) to offer civil unions to same-sex couples, conferring over 850 rights, privileges and responsibilities of marriage; legislators declined, however, to use the term &quot;marriage&quot; for same-sex unions. Thus, three separate government-recognized relationships are now in effect in the Garden State: domestic partnerships, civil unions, and marriage.

New Jersey also has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the U.S. These include bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and even slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. BB guns and black powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws. [ 80 ] 

New Jersey has a severe city/urban litter reputational problem, as noted in the report, &quot;New Jersey: America&apos;s Ugly Urban/City Litter (Trash) State.&quot; The state still has no statewide anti-litter slogan and its 1986 Clean Communities Act has been controversial in failing to help abate litter and debris on public streets, roadways and properties.

In past federal elections, New Jersey was a Republican bastion, but recently has become a Democratic stronghold. Currently, New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senate, 22–18, and Assembly, 48–32), both U.S. Senate seats, and 8 out of the state&apos;s 13 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives . The state had a Republican governor from 1994 to 2002, as Christie Todd Whitman won twice with vote percentages of 47 and 49 percent.

In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie defeated incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine . Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the party&apos;s candidate for governor, the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor are members of the Republican Party. The governor&apos;s appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party. (The 2009 Attorney General appointee is a Democrat.)

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the Democratic Party . For many years, however, it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948 , 1968 , and 1976 . New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960 , 1968 , and 1992 . The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was Clifford P. Case in 1979. ( Nicholas F. Brady was appointed a U.S. Senator by Governor Thomas Kean in 1982 and served for eight months, after Harrison A. Williams resigned the Senate seat following the Abscam investigations.)

The state&apos;s Democratic strongholds include Camden County , Essex County (including Newark , the state&apos;s largest city), Hudson County (including Jersey City , the state&apos;s second-largest city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton ), Middlesex County , and Union County (including Elizabeth , the state&apos;s fourth-largest city).

The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean County and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially Morris County , Sussex County , and Warren County . Other suburban counties, especially Bergen County and Burlington County had the majority of votes go to the Democratic Party . In the 2008 election, President Barack Obama won New Jersey with approximately fifty-seven percent of the vote, compared to McCain&apos;s forty-one percent. Independent candidate Ralph Nader garnered less than one percent of the vote.

About one-third of the state&apos;s counties are considered &quot;swing&quot; counties, but some go more one way than others. For example, Salem County , the same is true with Passaic County , with a highly populated Hispanic Democratic south (including Paterson , the state&apos;s third-largest city) and a rural, Republican north. Other &quot;swing&quot; counties like Monmouth County , Somerset County , and Cape May County tend to go Republican, as they also have population in conservative areas.

To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 29 days prior.

 Capital punishment [link] 

On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey is the first state to pass such legislation since Iowa and West Virginia eliminated executions in 1965. [ 82 ] Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death Row prisoners&apos; sentences from &quot;Death&quot; to &quot;Life in Prison with No Parole.&quot; [ 83 ]

New Jersey currently has four teams from major professional sports leagues playing in the state, although the Major League Soccer team and two National Football League teams identify themselves as being from New York City. A fifth team, the Women&apos;s National Basketball Association &apos;s Liberty , are temporarily playing in Newark until renovations for Madison Square Garden are completed in 2013.
 The Prudential Center in Newark, home of the NHL&apos;s New Jersey Devils. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , home to the NFL&apos;s New York Giants and New York Jets. Red Bull Arena in Harrison , home of the MLS&apos;s New York Red Bulls. 
The National Hockey League &apos;s New Jersey Devils , based in Newark at the Prudential Center , is the only major league franchise to bear the state&apos;s name, However, most of the Devils fans are in the Northern part of the state; the southern part of the state, is an overwhelming fan base for the Philadelphia Flyers , due to the region&apos;s close proximity to Philadelphia, leading to an intense rivalry between the two teams.

The Metropolitan Area&apos;s two National Football League teams, the New York Giants and the New York Jets , both play in East Rutherford , at MetLife Stadium . [ 84 ] At completion, with a construction cost of approximately $1.6 billion, [ 85 ] the venue is the most expensive sports stadium ever built. [ 86 ] On February 2, 2014, MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host Super Bowl XLVIII .

The New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer play in Red Bull Arena , a soccer-specific stadium located in Harrison outside of Downtown Newark.

The sports complex is also home to the Meadowlands Racetrack , one of three major harness racing tracks in the state. The Meadowlands Racetrack along with Freehold Raceway in Freehold are two of the major harness racing tracks in North America. Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport is also a popular spot for thoroughbred racing in New Jersey and the northeast. It hosted the Breeders&apos; Cup in 2007, and its turf course was renovated in preparation.

 Collegiate sports teams [link] 
 See also: List of college athletic programs in New Jersey, USA 
New Jerseyans&apos; collegiate allegiances are predominately split among the three major NCAA Division I programs in the state — the Rutgers University (New Jersey&apos;s largest state university) Scarlet Knights , the Seton Hall University (which is the state&apos;s largest Roman Catholic university) Pirates , and the Princeton University (the state&apos;s Ivy League university) Tigers . Both Rutgers and Seton Hall compete in the Big East Conference , and the rivalry between the two teams has always been an intense one. Rutgers and Princeton likewise have an intense rivalry—stemming from the first intercollegiate football game in 1869—though the two schools have not met on the football field since 1980. They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women&apos;s basketball programs. The university is planning a large expansion to the on-campus Rutgers Stadium —to accommodate the rising number of fans—and the teams play in Piscataway , which is adjacent to the New Brunswick campus. The university also fields rising basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers&apos; fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and Middlesex County , not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.

Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, also has campuses in Camden and Newark (in addition to its main campus in New Brunswick). The Rutgers-Camden athletic teams are called the Scarlet Raptors . The Rutgers-Newark athletic teams are called the Scarlet Raiders . The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA Division III .

Seton Hall, unlike Rutgers, does not field a football team. Its basketball team, however, has been one of the most storied programs in the Big East, and it plays its home games at the state-of-the-art Prudential Center , located in downtown Newark . The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominately Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the Jersey Shore .

The state&apos;s other Division I schools include the Monmouth University Hawks (West Long Branch), the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders (Newark), the Rider University Broncs (Lawrenceville), and the Saint Peter&apos;s College Peacocks and Peahens (Jersey City).

 Fairleigh Dickinson University competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the Northeast Conference and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the Middle Atlantic Conferences&apos; Freedom Conference and NCAA Division III.

Among the various Division III schools in the state, the Stevens Institute of Technology Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men&apos;s lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.

 Gambling [link] 
 Main article: Gambling in New Jersey 
In 1978, the New Jersey legislature approved casino gambling in Atlantic City . At that time, Las Vegas was the only mega-casino resort. [ 88 ] By 1978, Atlantic City was in decline. It was no longer the seaside resort that it once was. With the institution of casino gambling, Atlantic City has come back as a resort city. There are numerous famous casinos, with its main contributor being Donald Trump . Many lie along the Atlantic City Boardwalk, the longest boardwalk in the world.

Motion picture technology was developed by Thomas Edison , with much of his early work done at his West Orange laboratory. Edison&apos;s Black Maria was the first motion picture studio. America&apos;s first motion picture industry started in 1907 in Fort Lee and the first studio was constructed there in 1909. [ 95 ] DuMont Laboratories in Passaic , developed early sets and made the first broadcast to the private home.

A number of television shows and films have been filmed in New Jersey. Since 1978, the state has maintained a Motion Picture and Television Commission to encourage filming in-state. [ 96 ] New Jersey has long offered tax credits to television producers. Governor Christopher Christie suspended the credits in 2010, but the New Jersey State Legislature in 2011 approved the restoration and expansion of the tax credit program. Under bills passed by both the state Senate and Assembly, the program offers 20 percent tax credits (22% in urban enterprise zones ) to television and film productions that shoot in the state and meet set standards for hiring and local spending.

 Culture [link] 

 General [link] 

Like every state, New Jersey has its own cuisine , religious communities , museums , and halls of fame .

New Jersey is the birthplace of modern inventions such as: FM radio , the motion picture camera, the lithium battery , the light bulb , transistors , and the electric train. Other New Jersey creations include: the drive-in movie, the cultivated blueberry , cranberry sauce , the postcard, the boardwalk , the zipper , the phonograph , saltwater taffy , the dirigible, the seedless watermelon , [ 99 ] the first use of a submarine in warfare, and the ice cream cone.
 A diner in Freehold 
There are mineral museums in Franklin and Ogdensburg.

 Diners are common in New Jersey. The state is home to many diner manufacturers and has more diners than any other state: over 600. There are more diners in the state of New Jersey than any other place in the world. [ 100 ] 

New Jersey is the only state without a state song. &quot;I&apos;m From New Jersey&quot; is incorrectly listed on many websites as being the New Jersey State Song, but wasn&apos;t even a contender when in 1996 the New Jersey Arts Council submitted their suggestions to the New Jersey Legislature . [ 101 ] 

 Legends and ghosts [link] 

A long-circulated legend says a creature, the Jersey Devil or the Leeds Devil, terrorizes the population of the Pine Barrens . The New Jersey Devils are named for this mythical creature. New Jersey is also home to several other legends, such as the ghost of Annie&apos;s Road — a section of Riverview Drive between Totowa Road and Union Boulevard in Totowa , which is said to be haunted by a &quot;Lady in White&quot;; [ 102 ] and the haunted and demon-possessed Clinton Road in West Milford . Cooper Road in Middletown is said to be haunted by strange, ghostly people who jump out from behind trees at cars traveling down the unpaved portion of the road. The unpaved section has no street lights and thus is very dangerous as it has sharp turns where the ghostly people are said to jump in front of the cars from behind trees, causing them to crash. There is also the Atco Ghost — the ghost of a little boy who runs across the street late at night in Atco . It is also rumored that Jimmy Hoffa , the late leader of the Teamsters Union, is buried beneath Giants Stadium or the New Jersey Turnpike . However, on the popular television show MythBusters , the myth of Jimmy Hoffa being buried under Giants Stadium was debunked using ground penetrating radar .

The magazine Weird NJ (the creators of which later started Weird U.S. ) was started to catalog and explore the ghosts, legends, and prevalence of otherwise &quot;weird&quot; things in the state.

 Jersey , officially the Bailiwick of Jersey , French : Bailliage de Jersey (   / ˈ dʒ ɜr z i / , French:  [ʒɛʁzɛ] ; Jèrriais : Jèrri ), is a British Crown Dependency [ 5 ] off the coast of Normandy , France. [ 6 ] As well as the island of Jersey itself, the bailiwick includes two groups of small islands that are no longer permanently inhabited, the Minquiers and Écréhous , and the Pierres de Lecq [ 7 ] and other rocks and reefs.

Jersey is a self-governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy , with its own financial , legal and judicial systems. [ 8 ] 

The island of Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands . Although the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as &apos;the Channel Islands&apos;, they are not a constitutional or political unit. Jersey has a separate relationship to the British Crown from the other Crown Dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man . [ 9 ] It is not part of the United Kingdom , [ 10 ] and has an international identity separate from that of the UK [ 11 ] but the United Kingdom is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey. [ 12 ] Jersey is not a part of the European Union but has a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods. [ 13 ]

 Etymology [link] 

The Channel Islands are mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as following : Sarnia , Caesarea , Barsa , Silia and Andium , but Jersey cannot be identified specifically because none correspond directly to the present names. [ 35 ] Furthermore, later records evoke Angia (also spelled Agna  ). [ 36 ] 

 Andium is a Latinized version of the Gaulish (Celtic) *Andion , with and- the Gaulish intensive prefix meaning &quot;very&quot;, &quot;much&quot;, &quot;big&quot;. Andium roughly translates as &quot;big Island&quot;, Jersey being the largest of the Channel Islands. The spelling Angia could be an ultimate development of *Andia .

Some others identify it as Caesarea , a late recorded Roman name influenced by the Old English suffix -ey for &quot;island&quot;; [ 37 ] [ 38 ] this is plausible if, in the regional pronunciation of Latin , Caesarea was not [kaisarea] but [tʃeːsarea] . Another theory is that the variation of the &quot;J&quot; sound today could be connected with phonetical cousins &quot;g&quot; and &quot;k&quot; ( International Phonetic Alphabet ) through variable pronunciations based on similar spelling. Theoretically, if Caesarea was originally pronounced with a &quot;k&quot;, that may have naturally developed into a &quot;g&quot; sound for locals (or foreigners), making Gersei, Gersoi, or the other spellings relatable. Because &quot;g&quot; is pronounced as both a hard glutteral &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;go&quot; or a soft &quot;j&quot; as in &quot;gym&quot; or &quot;gem&quot;, the spelling of Jersey could be a result of the variance in its pronunciation.

 Angia could be a misspelling for *Augia , that is the Latinized form of Germanic *aujō (&gt;Old English ī(e)ġ &gt;is-land). [ 39 ] ), that could have extended before the Viking Age along the coast of France, as for île d&apos;Yeu ( Augia , Insula Oya ) or Oye-Plage ( Ogia 7th C.) and constitutes the suffix -ey in Jersey, Guernsey ( Greneroi ), Alderney ( Alneroi ) and Chausey ( Calsoi ). [ 40 ] Chausey can be compared with Cholsey (GB, Berkshire, Ċeolesiġ 891), interpreted by Eilert Ekwall [ 41 ] as &quot; Ċeola &apos;s island&quot;.

These -ey names could have been reinforced by the Viking heritage, because -ey is similar, so that it is possible to interpret the first part of the toponym as an Old Norse element. The source of it is unclear. Scholars surmise it derives from jarð (Old Norse for &quot;earth&quot;) or jarl (earl), or perhaps a personal name, Geirr (&quot;Geirr&apos;s Island&quot;). [ 42 ] 

 History [link] 
 Main article: History of Jersey 
Jersey history is influenced by its strategic location between the northern coast of France and the southern coast of England; the island&apos;s recorded history extends over a thousand years.

Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. Archaeological evidence of Roman influence has been found, in particular the coastal headland site at Le Pinacle, Les Landes, where remains of a primitive structure are attributed to Gallo-roman temple worship ( fanum ). [ 43 ] Evidence for settled Roman occupation has yet to be established [ dubious – discuss ] .

Jersey was part of Neustria with the same Gallo-Frankish population as the continental mainland. Jersey, the whole Channel Islands and the Cotentin peninsula (probably with the Avranchin ) came formerly under the control of the duke of Brittany during the Viking invasions, because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them, however they remained in the archbishopric of Rouen . Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the ninth century, and was eventually annexed to the future Duchy of Normandy , together with the other Channel Islands, Cotentin and Avranchin, by William Longsword , count of Rouen in 933 and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William&apos;s descendant, William the Conqueror , conquered England in 1066, the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch. [ 44 ] The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island, and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman-French Jersey family names. King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II Augustus , but retained possession of Jersey and the other Channel Islands. The islands have been internally self-governing since then. [ 45 ] 

Islanders travelled across the North Atlantic to participate in the Newfoundland fisheries in the late 16th century. [ 46 ] In recognition for help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, Charles II gave George Carteret , bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies in between the Hudson and Delaware rivers which he promptly named New Jersey . It is now a state in the United States of America . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 

On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men (of whom half didn&apos;t arrive) landed to take over the island. The battle by 9,000 men to defend the Island, although touch-and-go, and decisive, only lasted about half an hour. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and 600 French prisoners were taken. Both commanders were slain. [ 49 ] 

Trade laid the foundations of prosperity, aided by neutrality between England and France. [ 50 ] The Jersey way of life involved agriculture, milling , fishing, shipbuilding , and production of woollen goods. 19th century improvements in transport links brought tourism to the island.

During World War II, Jersey was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1 July 1940 until 9 May 1945, when Germany surrendered. [ 51 ] During this time the Germans constructed many fortifications using Russian slave labour. After 1944 supplies from mainland France were interrupted by the D-Day landings and food on the island became scarce. The SS Vega was sent to the island carrying Red Cross supplies and news of the success of the Allied advance in Europe. The Channel Islands were one of the last places in Europe to be liberated.

 Politics [link] 
 The States building in St. Helier. Main article: Politics of Jersey 
Jersey&apos;s unicameral legislature is the Assembly of the States of Jersey . It includes fifty-one elected members: ten senators (elected on an island-wide basis), twelve Connétables (often called &apos;constables&apos;, heads of parishes ) and twenty-nine deputies (representing constituencies), all elected for four year terms as from the October 2011 elections . [ 52 ] There are also five non-voting members appointed by the Crown: the Bailiff , the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey , the Dean of Jersey , the Attorney General and Solicitor General. [ 53 ] 

The government is a Council of Ministers , consisting of a Chief Minister and nine ministers. [ 54 ] Each minister may appoint up to two assistant ministers. [ 55 ] A Chief Executive is head of the civil service. [ 56 ] Some government functions are carried out in the island&apos;s twelve parishes .

The Bailiff is President (presiding officer) of the States Assembly, [ 57 ] head of the judiciary and as civic head of the island carries out various ceremonial roles.

As one of the Crown Dependencies, Jersey is autonomous and self-governing, with its own independent legal, administrative and fiscal systems. [ 58 ] In 1973, the Royal Commission on the Constitution set out the duties of the Crown as including: ultimate responsibility for the &apos;good government&apos; of the Crown Dependencies; ratification of island legislation by Order in Council (Royal Assent); international representation, subject to consultation with the island authorities before concluding any agreement which would apply to them; ensuring the islands meet their international obligations; and defence. [ 59 ] 

 Elizabeth II &apos;s traditional title as Head of State is Duke of Normandy . [ 60 ] &quot; The Crown &quot; is defined by the Law Officers of the Crown as the &quot;Crown in right of Jersey&quot;. [ 61 ] The Queen&apos;s representative and adviser in the island is the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey . He is a point of contact between Jersey ministers and the United Kingdom government and carries out executive functions in relation to immigration control, deportation, naturalisation and the issue of passports. [ 62 ] Since September 2011, the incumbent Lieutenant Governor has been General Sir John McColl .

 Legal system [link] 
 Main article: Law of Jersey 
Jersey is a distinct jurisdiction for the purposes of conflict of laws , separate from the other Channel Islands, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [ 63 ] 

 Jersey law has been influenced by several different legal traditions, in particular Norman customary law , English common law and modern French civil law . [ 64 ] Jersey&apos;s legal system is therefore described as &apos;mixed&apos; or &apos; pluralistic &apos;, and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main working language of the legal system is English.

The principal court is the Royal Court , with appeals to the Jersey Court of Appeal and, ultimately, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . The Bailiff is head of the judiciary; the Bailiff and the Deputy Bailiff are appointed by the Crown. Other members of the island&apos;s judiciary are appointed by the Bailiff.

 Parishes [link] 
 Main article: Parishes of Jersey The parishes of Jersey 
Administratively, Jersey is divided into twelve parishes . All border on the sea. They were named after the Christian saints to whom their ancient parish churches were dedicated:

 Grouville (historically Saint Martin de Grouville ; incorporating Les Minquiers ) Saint Brélade Saint Clément Saint Helier Saint John Saint Lawrence Saint Martin (historically Saint Martin le Vieux ; incorporating Les Écréhous ) Saint Mary Saint Ouen Saint Peter Saint Saviour Trinity 

The parishes of Jersey are further divided into vingtaines (or, in St. Ouen, cueillettes ), divisions that are historic. Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.

The Connétable is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the Assembly of the States of Jersey . The Procureur du Bien Public (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003 ; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the Loi (1804) au sujet des assemblées paroissiales ). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The Parish Assembly is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.

Each parish elects its own force of Honorary Police consisting of Centeniers , Vingteniers and Constable&apos;s Officers . Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the Chef de Police ) deputised for the Connétable in the States of Jersey when the Connétable was unable to attend a sitting of the States. This function has now been abolished.

 International relations [link] 
 Jersey Airport greets travellers with &quot;Welcome to Jersey&quot; sign in Jèrriais . 
Although diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown, Jersey has been developing its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains the Bureau de Jersey in Caen, France , a permanent non-diplomatic representation, with a branch office in Rennes . A similar office, the Maison de Normandie in St. Helier, represents the Conseil général of Manche and the Conseil régional of Basse-Normandie . It hosts the Consulate of France.

Jersey is a member of the British-Irish Council , the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie . Jersey wants to become a full member of the Commonwealth in its own right. [ 65 ] 

 International identity [link] 

In 2007, the Chief Minister and the UK Lord Chancellor signed an agreement [ 11 ] that established a framework for the development of the international identity of Jersey. The agreement stated that:

 the UK has no democratic accountability in and for Jersey; the UK will not act internationally on behalf of Jersey without prior consultation; Jersey has an international identity that is different from that of the UK; the UK recognises that the interests of Jersey may differ from those of the UK, and the UK will seek to represent any differing interests when acting in an international capacity; and the UK and Jersey will work together to resolve or clarify any differences that may arise between their respective interests. 

In January 2011, the Chief Minister designated one of his assistant ministers as having responsibility for external relations; he is now often described as the island&apos;s &apos;foreign minister&apos;. [ 66 ] 

 Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) have been signed directly by the island with several countries, including: the United States of America (2002); the Netherlands (2007); Denmark , the Faroes , Finland , Greenland , Iceland , Sweden and Norway (2008); the United Kingdom, France, Australia and New Zealand (2009); Portugal (2010); People&apos;s Republic of China , Turkey , Mexico , Canada , Indonesia , Czech Republic , South Africa , Argentina , and India (2011). [ 67 ] 

 Relationship with the European Union [link] 
 See also: Special member state territories and the European Union 
Jersey is neither a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union . It does, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. [ 68 ] Protocol 3 and other relevant treaty provisions are made part of Jersey Law by the European Communities (Jersey) Law 1973. [ 69 ] The relationship between the Channel Islands and the EU cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of all Member States and Island authorities. [ 70 ] 

Under Protocol 3, Jersey is part of the European Union Customs Union of the European Community . The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States . EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. [ 71 ] Nor is Jersey part of the single market in financial services . It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. Jersey plans to incorporate such measures where appropriate, with particular regard to the island&apos;s commitment to meeting international standards of financial regulation and countering money laundering and terrorist financing .

British citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another Member state of the European Union , are not considered to be European Union citizens . [ 72 ] They have &apos;Islander status&apos; and their Jersey-issued British passports are endorsed with the words &apos;the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment&apos;. [ 73 ] 

Jersey residents do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament . Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions. [ 74 ] Jersey is particularly concerned about European Union legislation and reforms that may affect its trading partners in international financial centres round the world.

 Independence [link] 
 See also: Devolution in the United Kingdom  and European microstates 
The question of Jersey&apos;s independence has been discussed from time to time in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. In 2005-2008, a working group of the States of Jersey examined the options for independence, concluding that Jersey &apos;is equipped to face the challenges of independence&apos; but making no recommendations. [ 75 ] Proposals for Jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the States . [ 76 ] 

 Geography [link] 
 Satellite view of Jersey. Coastline of Bonne Nuit Map of islands of Bailiwick of Jersey Main article: Geography of Jersey 
Jersey is an island measuring 118.2 square kilometres [ 5 ] (65,569 vergée  / 46 sq mi), including reclaimed land and intertidal zone. It lies in the English Channel , about 12 nautical miles (22  km ; 14  mi ) from the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy , France, and about 87 nautical miles (161 km; 100 mi) south of Great Britain. [ 77 ] It is the largest and southernmost of the Channel Islands, with a maximum land elevation of 136 m (446 ft) above sea level at WA 57795 06708 (current UTM30 grid).

The climate is temperate with mild winters and cool summers. [ 78 ] The average annual temperature, 11.6 °C (52.9 °F) is similar to the South Coast of England and the mean annual total sunshine is 1912 hours. [ 79 ] The terrain consists of a plateau sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north. The plateau is cut by valleys running generally north-south.

 Economy [link] 
 Main article: Economy of Jersey 
Jersey&apos;s economy is based on financial services (43% of GVA in 2009), tourism (hotels, restaurants and bars making 3% of GVA in 2009), electronic commerce , and agriculture (2% of GVA in 2009). [ 80 ] 

Thanks to specialisation in a few high-return sectors, at purchasing power parity Jersey has high economic output per capita, substantially ahead of all of the world&apos;s large developed economies. Gross national income in 2009 was £3.7 billion (approximately £40,000 per head of population). [ 80 ] However, this is not indicative of each individual resident&apos;s purchasing power, and the actual standard of living in Jersey is comparable to that in the United Kingdom outside central London. The island is recognised as one of the leading offshore financial centres . In June 2005 the States introduced the Competition (Jersey) Law 2005 [ 81 ] to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth. This competition law was based on that of other jurisdictions.

Tourism supports not only hotels, but also retail and services: in 2009 there were 685,200 visitors spending £230 million. [ 80 ] Duty-free goods are available for purchase on travel to and from the island.

In 2009 57% of the Island&apos;s area was agricultural land (an increase on 2008). Major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce; agriculture&apos;s share of GVA increased 5% in 2009, a fifth successive year of growth. [ 80 ] Jersey cattle are a small breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream; although the quality of its meat is also appreciated on a small scale. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The herd total in 2009 was 5,090 animals. [ 80 ] Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey&apos;s marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009. [ 80 ] 

Farmers and growers often sell surplus food and flowers in boxes on the roadside, relying on the honesty of customers to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want. In the 21st century, diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the roadside stalls.

53,460 people were employed in Jersey as of December 2010: 24% in financial and legal services; 16% in wholesale and retail trades; 16% in the public sector; 10% in education, health and other private sector services; 10% in construction and quarrying; 9% in hotels, restaurants and bars. [ 80 ] 

Jersey along with Guernsey has its own lottery called The Channel Islands Lottery that was launched in 1975.

On 18 February 2005, Jersey was granted Fairtrade Island status. [ 84 ] 

 Taxation [link] 

Until the 20th century, the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey. The levying of impôts (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body&apos;s tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during World War II.

Because VAT has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way.

Although Jersey does not have VAT, the States of Jersey introduced a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on the 1st June 2011. Some supplies are taxed at 0% and others exempt. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK, food is also not exempt unlike with VAT.

Jersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation and its Zero-Ten legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation as of 31 December 2011, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group. The Code of Conduct Group, at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The European Commission has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited &quot;political&quot; authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.

 Currency [link] 
 Twin cash machines at a bank that dispensed a choice of Bank of England or Jersey banknotes. Since the intervention of the Treasurer of the States in 2005, cash machines generally (with the exception of those at the Airport and Elizabeth Harbour) no longer dispense English notes. Main article: Jersey pound 
Jersey issues its own Jersey banknotes and coins that circulate with UK coinage, Bank of England notes, Scottish notes and Guernsey currency within the island. Jersey currency is not legal tender outside Jersey: However, in the United Kingdom it is acceptable tender [ 85 ] and can be surrendered at banks within that country in exchange for Bank of England -issued currency on a like-for-like basis.

 Coinage [link] 

Designs on the reverse of Jersey coins :

    1p Le Hocq Tower (coastal defence)    2p L&apos;Hermitage, site where St. Helier lived    5p Seymour Tower (offshore defence) 10p La Pouquelaye de Faldouet ( dolmen ) 20p La Corbière Lighthouse 50p Grosnez Castle (ruins) 

The main currency of Jersey is the pound, although in many places the euro is accepted because of the positioning of the island. Pound coins are issued, but are much less widely used than pound notes. Designs on the reverse of Jersey pound coins include historic ships built in Jersey and a series of the twelve parishes&apos; crests. The motto around the milled edge of Jersey pound coins is Insula Caesarea (English: Island of Jersey). Two pound coins are also issued, but in very small quantities.

 Demographics [link] 
 Mont Orgueil was built in the 13th century to protect Jersey from French invasion. Main article: Demographics of Jersey 
Censuses have been undertaken in Jersey since 1821. In the 2011 census, the total resident population was estimated to be 97,857, of whom 34% live in Saint Helier , the island&apos;s only town. [ 86 ] Only half the island&apos;s population was born in Jersey; 31% of the population were born elsewhere in the British Isles, 7% in Portugal or Madeira, 8% in other European countries and 4% elsewhere. [ 87 ] 

The people of Jersey are often called Islanders or, in individual terms, Jerseyman or Jerseywoman. Some Jersey-born people identify as British and value the special relationship between the British Crown and the island.

 Religion in Jersey has a complex history and much diversity. The established church is the Church of England . In the countryside, Methodism found its traditional stronghold. A minority of Roman Catholics can also be found in Jersey. There are two Catholic private secondary schools: De La Salle College in Saint Saviour is an all-boys school, and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Helier is an all-girls school; and FCJ primary school in St. Saviour. A Catholic order of Sisters has a presence in school life.

 Immigration [link] 

Jersey belongs to the Common Travel Area [ 88 ] and the definition of &quot;United Kingdom&quot; in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together. [ 89 ] 

For immigration and nationality purposes, the United Kingdom generally treats Jersey as though it were part of the UK. Jersey is constitutionally entitled to restrict immigration [ 90 ] by non-Jersey residents, but control of immigration at the point of entry cannot be introduced for British, certain Commonwealth and EEA nationals without change to existing international law. [ 91 ] Immigration is therefore controlled by a mixture of restrictions on those without residential status purchasing or renting property in the island and restrictions on employment. Migration policy is to move to a registration system to integrate residential and employment status. [ 91 ] Jersey maintains its own immigration [ 92 ] and border controls. United Kingdom immigration legislation may be extended to Jersey by order in council (subject to exceptions and adaptations) following consultation with Jersey and with Jersey&apos;s consent. [ 93 ] Although Jersey citizens are full British citizens, an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in European Union states other than the UK is placed in the passports of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. [ 94 ] Those who have a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom, or who have lived in the United Kingdom for five years, are not subject to this restriction.

Historical large-scale immigration was facilitated by the introduction of steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people , mostly half-pay officers and their families, had settled in Jersey. [ 95 ] In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian , Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napoléon &apos;s coup of 1851, more French proscrits arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.

Seasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on Bretons and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following Liberation in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom – the demands of reconstruction in mainland Normandy and Brittany employed domestic labour.

Until the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population. From the 1960s Portuguese workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.

A trend that has developed over the past few years is the setting up of recruitment agencies in a number of countries in the world, to employ either cheap labour (often from poor countries) or qualified/experienced labour. Amongst the countries that have been targeted for this type of recruitment are: Australia , Cyprus , Kenya , Latvia , Nigeria , Poland , Portugal , and South Africa .

 Culture [link] 
 Main article: Culture of Jersey Jèrriais road sign (&quot;The black road&quot;) in Saint Ouen . 
Until the 19th century, indigenous Jèrriais – a variety of Norman – was the language of the island, though French was used for official business. During the 20th century an intense language shift took place and Jersey today is predominantly English-speaking. Jèrriais nonetheless survives; around 2,600 islanders (three percent) are reckoned to be habitual speakers, and some 10,000 (12 percent) in all claim some knowledge of the language, particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes. There have been efforts to revive Jèrriais in schools, and the highest number of declared Jèrriais speakers is in the capital.
 Actress Lillie Langtry , nicknamed the Jersey Lily . 
The dialects of Jèrriais differ in phonology and, to a lesser extent, lexis between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in Jèrriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. Anglicisation of the toponymy increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.

Some Neolithic carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey. Only fragmentary wall-paintings remain from the rich mediaeval artistic heritage, after the wholesale iconoclasm of the Calvinist Reformation of the 16th century.

The island is particularly famous for the Battle of Flowers , a carnival held annually since 1902. [ 96 ] Other festivals include La Fête dé Noué [ 97 ] (Christmas festival), La Faîs&apos;sie d&apos;Cidre (cidermaking festival), [ 98 ] the Battle of Britain air display, Jersey Live Music Festival, Branchage Film Festival, food festivals, and parish events.

The island&apos;s patron saint is Saint Helier . [ 99 ]

 Music [link] 
 The Band of the Island of Jersey play at many events [ 107 ] 
The traditional folk music of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid-20th century. It cannot be separated from the musical traditions of continental Europe , and the majority of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants, particularly in France . Most of the surviving traditional songs are in French, with a minority in Jèrriais.

In contemporary music, Nerina Pallot has enjoyed international success. Music festivals include Jersey Live , Rock in the Park, Avanchi presents Jazz in July, the music section of the Jersey Eisteddfod and the Liberation Jersey Music Festival. [ 108 ] 

 Cinema [link] 

In 1909, T.J. West established the first cinema in the Royal Hall in St. Helier, which became known as West&apos;s Cinema in 1923 (demolished 1977). The first talking picture , The Perfect Alibi , was shown on 30 December 1929 at the Picture House in St. Helier. The Jersey Film Society was founded on 11 December 1947 at the Café Bleu, West&apos;s Cinema. The large Art Deco Forum Cinema was opened in 1935 – during the German occupation this was used for German propaganda films.

The Odeon Cinema was opened 2 June 1952 and, was later rebranded in the early 21st century as the Forum cinema. Its owners, however, struggled to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group, which opened a 10 screen multiplex on the waterfront centre in St. Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Forum closed its doors in late 2008. In August 2006, plans were revealed to convert the former Odeon building into a department store while retaining the landmark architecture.

Since 1997, Kevin Lewis (formerly of the Cine Centre and the New Forum) has arranged the Jersey Film Festival, a charity event showing the latest and also classic films outdoors in 35 mm on a big screen. The 2011 festival was held in Howard Davis Park, St Saviour, on the 13–19 August 2011. [ 109 ] First held in 2008, the Branchage Jersey International Film Festival [ 110 ] attracts filmmakers from all over the world.

 Food and drink [link] 
 Jersey wonders , or mèrvelles , are a favourite snack consisting of fried dough, found especially at country fêtes. According to tradition, the success of cooking depends on the state of the tide. 
Seafood has traditionally been important to the cuisine of Jersey: mussels (called moules in the Island), oysters , lobster and crabs – especially spider crabs – ormers , and conger .

Jersey milk being very rich, cream and butter have played a large part in insular cooking. (See Channel Island milk ) However there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey fudge , mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.

 Jersey Royal potatoes are the local variety of new potato , and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.

Apples historically were an important crop. Bourdélots are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter ( lé nièr beurre ), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. Cider used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Apple brandy is also produced, as is some wine.

Among other traditional dishes are cabbage loaf, Jersey wonders ( les mèrvelles ), fliottes, bean crock ( les pais au fou ), nettle ( ortchie ) soup, vraic buns.

 Sport [link] 
 Main article: Sport in Jersey A statue of Jersey golfer, Harry Vardon , stands at the entrance to the Royal Jersey Golf Club 
In its own right Jersey participates in the Commonwealth Games and in the biennial Island Games , which it last hosted in 1997 and will next host in 2015. [ 111 ] 

In sporting events in which Jersey does not have international representation, when the British Home Nations are competing separately, islanders that do have high athletic skill may choose to compete for any of the Home Nations – there are, however, restrictions on subsequent transfers to represent another Home Nation.

Jersey is an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The Jersey cricket team plays in the Inter-insular match among others. The Jersey cricket team competed in the World Division 4, held in Tanzania in October 2008, after recently finishing as runners-up and therefore being promoted from the World Division 5 held in Jersey. They also competed in the European Division 2, held in Guernsey during August 2008. The youth cricket teams have been promoted to play in the European Division 1 alongside Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Guernsey . In two tournaments at this level Jersey have finished 6th.

For horseracing, Les Landes Racecourse can be found at Les Landes in St. Ouen next to the ruins of Grosnez Castle .

The Jersey Football Association supervises football in Jersey. The Jersey Football Combination has 9 teams in its top division. The 2006/07 champions were Jersey Scottish where Ross Crick is the top scorer. The Jersey national football team plays in the annual Muratti competition among others.

 Wace is Jersey&apos;s earliest known author. Printing arrived in Jersey only in the 1780s, but the island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and Jèrriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished (see Jèrriais literature ).The first Jèrriais book to be published was Rimes et Poésies Jersiaises de divers auteurs réunies et mises en ordre , edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include Elinor Glyn , John Lemprière , Philippe Le Sueur Mourant , Robert Pipon Marett , and Augustus Asplet Le Gros .

 Early life, education, and family [link] 

Chris Christie was born in Newark, New Jersey , the son of Sondra A. (née Grasso) and Wilbur James &quot;Bill&quot; Christie, a certified public accountant. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Christie is of Scottish, Irish, and Sicilian descent. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] He was raised in Livingston , graduating from Livingston High School . [ 9 ] Christie graduated from the University of Delaware with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1984 and Seton Hall University School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1987. Christie was admitted to the Bar of the State of New Jersey and the Bar of the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, in December 1987. After being elected the Governor of New Jersey , he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Rutgers University , the state university of New Jersey, and Monmouth University in 2010. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] 

In 1986, Christie married Mary Pat Foster, a fellow student at the University of Delaware. After marriage they shared a one-room apartment in Summit, New Jersey . Mary Pat Christie pursued a career in investment banking, eventually working at the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald . She left the firm in 2001 following the September 11 attacks , only recently returning to work part-time. [ 3 ] They have four children: Andrew (born 1993), Sarah (born 1996), Patrick (born 2000), and Bridget (born 2003). [ 12 ] Christie and his family reside in Mendham Township . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] 

 Early career [link] 

 Lawyer [link] 

In 1987, Christie joined the law firm of Dughi, Hewit&amp;Palatucci of Cranford, New Jersey . In 1993, he was named a partner in the firm. Christie specialized in securities law, appellate practice, election law, and government affairs. He is a member of the American Bar Association and the New Jersey State Bar Association and was a member of the Election Law Committee of the New Jersey State Bar Association.

 Morris County Freeholder [link] 

Christie, at the time a resident of Mendham , was in 1994 elected as a Republican to the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders, with Christie and a running mate having defeated incumbent freeholders in the party primary. After that election, the defeated incumbents filed defamation lawsuits against Christie based on statements made during the primary campaign. Christie had incorrectly stated that the incumbents were under investigation for violating certain local laws. The lawsuit was settled out of court. [ 15 ] 

As freeholder, Christie required the county government to obtain three quotes from qualified firms for all contracts. He led a successful effort to bar county officials from accepting gifts from people and firms doing business with the county. He voted to raise the county&apos;s open space tax for land preservation; however, county taxes on the whole were decreased by 6.6% during his tenure. He successfully pushed for the dismissal of an architect hired to design a new jail, saying that the architect was costing taxpayers too much money. The architect then sued Christie for defamation over remarks he made about the dismissal. [ 16 ] 

In 1995, Christie announced a bid for a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly ; he and attorney Rick Merkt ran as a ticket against incumbent Assemblyman Anthony Bucco and attorney Michael Patrick Carroll in the Republican primary. Bucco and Carroll, the establishment candidates, defeated the up-and-comers by a wide margin. After this loss, Christie&apos;s bid for re-nomination to the freeholder board was unlikely, as unhappy Republicans recruited John J. Murphy to run against Christie in 1997. Murphy defeated Christie in the primary. [ 17 ] Murphy, who had falsely accused Christie of having the county pay his legal bills in the architect&apos;s lawsuit, was sued by Christie after the election. They settled out of court; nevertheless, Christie&apos;s career in Morris County politics was over by 1998.

 Lobbyist [link] 

In 1998 Christie registered as a lobbyist for the firm of Dughi, Hewit&amp;Palatucci, alongside fellow partner and later, gubernatorial campaign fundraiser Bill Palatucci. Between 1999 and 2001, Christie and Palatucci lobbied on behalf of, among others, GPU Energy for deregulation of New Jersey&apos;s electric and gas industry; the Securities Industry Association to block the inclusion of securities fraud under the state&apos;s Consumer Fraud Act; Hackensack University Medical Center for state grants, and the University of Phoenix for a New Jersey higher education license. [ 18 ] 

 United States Attorney [link] 

Christie served as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey from January 17, 2002, to December 1, 2008. His office included 137 attorneys, with offices in Newark , Trenton and Camden . Christie also served as one of the 17 U.S. Attorneys on Attorney General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales &apos; advisory committee .

 Appointment [link] 

On December 7, 2001, Christie was nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey . He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on December 20, 2001, and sworn into office on January 17, 2002.

Controversy surrounded his appointment; some members of the New Jersey Bar professed disappointment at Christie&apos;s lack of criminal law experience and his history as a top fundraiser for George W. Bush &apos;s 2000 presidential campaign . [ 19 ] The extent of the role played by Bush&apos;s political adviser, Karl Rove , also became an issue after Christie&apos;s law partner, William Palatucci, a Republican political consultant and Bush supporter, boasted that he had selected a United States attorney by forwarding Christie&apos;s résumé to Rove. [ 20 ] 

Christie has stated that his distant familial connection to Genovese crime family leader Tino Fiumara never came up during his Federal Bureau of Investigation background check for his position as a U.S. Attorney; he told The New York Times in 2009 that he had assumed that investigators were aware of the connection. [ 21 ] During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Christie recused himself from his office&apos;s investigation, indictment, and prosecution of Fiumara for aiding the flight of a fugitive. [ 21 ] A 2011 commentary on MarketWatch identified Fiumara as Christie&apos;s aunt&apos;s husband&apos;s late brother and said Christie has dismissed the relationship as a &quot;private matter&quot;. [ 22 ] 

 Achievements [link] 
 Christie in 2004 as the United States Attorney for New Jersey. 
Despite the initial misgivings over his degree of experience, Christie received praise for his history of convictions for public corruption. During his tenure, Christie&apos;s office won convictions or guilty pleas from 130 public officials, both Republican and Democratic , on the state, county and local levels without losing a single case. [ 23 ] The most notable of these convictions included those of Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski in 2002 on bribery charges, [ 24 ] Essex County Executive James W. Treffinger in 2003 on corruption charges, [ 25 ] former New Jersey Senate President John A. Lynch, Jr. in 2006 on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion, [ 26 ] State Senator and former Newark mayor Sharpe James in 2008 on fraud charges, [ 27 ] and State Senator Wayne R. Bryant in 2008 on charges of bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud. [ 28 ] 

 Claims of misuse of deferred prosecution agreements [link] 

Christie has been accused of using his office&apos;s role in crafting deferred prosecution agreements to award lucrative federal monitoring positions in no-bid contracts to friends, supporters, and allies. [ 29 ] Questions first arose after Christie awarded a multimillion-dollar no-bid contract to David Kelley, another former U.S. Attorney, who had investigated Christie&apos;s brother, Todd Christie, in a 2005 fraud case involving traders at the Wall Street firm, Spear, Leeds&amp;Kellogg . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Kelley had declined to prosecute Todd Christie, who had been ranked fourth in the investigation—initiating a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint among twenty traders who earned the largest profits for their company at the expense of their customers. The top three were indicted, as were eleven other traders. [ 32 ] 

Christie was similarly criticized for his 2007 recommendation of the appointment of The Ashcroft Group , a consulting firm owned by Christie&apos;s former superior, the former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft , as a monitor in a court settlement against Zimmer Holdings , an Indiana medical supplies company. The no-bid contract was worth between $28 million and $52 million. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Christie defended the decision, saying that Ashcroft’s prominence and legal acumen made him a natural choice. Christie declined to intercede when Zimmer&apos;s company lawyers protested the Group’s plans to charge a rate of $1.5 million to $2.9 million per month for the monitoring. [ 29 ] [ 35 ] Shortly after the House Judiciary Committee began holding hearings on the matter, the Justice Department re-wrote the rules regarding the appointment of court monitors. [ 36 ] 

Christie also faced criticism over the terms of a $311-million fraud settlement with Bristol-Myers Squibb . Christie’s office deferred criminal prosecution of the pharmaceutical company in a deal that required it to dedicate $5 million for a business ethics chair at Seton Hall University School of Law , Christie&apos;s alma mater. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The U.S. Justice Department subsequently set guidelines forbidding such requirements as components of out-of-court corporate crime settlements. [ 39 ] 

In June 2009, Christie was called before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its consideration of new regulations on deferred prosecution agreements. In his testimony, he defended his decisions to award no-bid, high-paying federal monitoring contracts to law firms that his critics say constitute a conflict of interest. Christie left the meeting after two and a half hours of questioning, against the requests of the Committee&apos;s chairman, stating that he had to attend to pressing business in New Jersey. [ 29 ] [ 40 ] 

 Claims of partisan attacks [link] 
 Christie at a town hall meeting in Union City, New Jersey February 9, 2011. 
Christie has been criticized for subpoenaing Senator Robert Menendez during his contested 2006 campaign, just two months before the election. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Christie&apos;s aides have insisted that they initiated the action in response to an article that appeared in The Record , which reported that in 1994, when Menendez was a U.S. Representative , he had leased his former home to a social service agency that he had helped obtain federal financing. [ 41 ] The non-profit group paid Menendez more than $300,000 over nine years to rent the building. Menendez claims to have cleared the arrangement with the Congressional ethics office, a step that had also been reported previously by New Jersey newspapers. [ 41 ] According to Menendez, just prior to signing the rental lease, he cleared it by phone with a lawyer on the staff of the United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct . Following the subpoena, the lawyer, who no longer works with the Committee, came forward to say that while she doesn’t recall the conversation, it probably happened—and that if she were advising Menendez now, she would tell him—as she apparently did then—that there was nothing improper about the arrangement. [ 43 ] As of August 2009, nothing has come from the investigation. [ 41 ] 

 Cell phone monitoring and alleged entrapment [link] 

In 2005, Christie prosecuted the Hemant Lakhani terrorism case, in which the defendant claimed that he had been entrapped . In that case, Christie&apos;s office relied on an informant who had been dismissed by the FBI as unreliable for fabricating claims of terrorist activity. For more than a year, the informant, working with the U.S. attorney&apos;s office, solicited Lakhani for access to arms. Lakhani was unable to obtain anything until an undercover agent contacted him and supplied him with a fake missile. In an interview with the public radio program This American Life , [ 44 ] Christie brushed off suggestions that Lakhani was entrapped by law enforcement, defending the Lakhani prosecution.

In April 2009, the ACLU publicized records showing that Christie had obtained court orders authorizing warrantless cellphone tracking of people in 79 instances. Christie responded that the practice was legal and court approved. An ACLU attorney stated that federal law does not address cell phone or GPS use in surveillance and added that the ACLU believes a law requiring warrants for such use is needed. [ 45 ] 

 Governor of New Jersey [link] 
 See also: New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009 Main article: Governorship of Chris Christie 
Christie filed as a candidate for the office of Governor on January 8, 2009. [ 46 ] In the primary on June 2, Christie won the Republican nomination with 55% of the vote, defeating conservative opponents Steve Lonegan and Rick Merkt . [ 47 ] He then chose Kimberly Guadagno , Monmouth County sheriff , to complete his campaign ticket as a candidate for lieutenant governor . On November 3, Christie defeated Corzine by a margin of 48.5% to 44.9%, with 5.8% of the vote going to independent candidate Chris Daggett . [ 48 ] 

Christie took office as Governor of New Jersey on January 19, 2010. He chose not to move his family into &quot; Drumthwacket &quot;, the official governor&apos;s mansion, and instead resides in a private Mendham, New Jersey , residence.

On February 9, 2010, he signed Executive Order No. 12, which placed a 90-day freeze on the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) and established the Housing Opportunity Task Force to examine the State&apos;s affordable housing laws, constitutional obligations, and the effectiveness of the current framework. [ 49 ] 

On February 11, 2010, Christie signed Executive Order No. 14, which declared a &quot;state of fiscal emergency exists in the State of New Jersey&quot; due to the projected $2.2 billion budget deficit for the current fiscal year (FY 2010). [ 50 ] In a speech before a special joint session of the New Jersey Legislature on the same day, Christie addressed the budget deficit and revealed a list of fiscal solutions to close the gap. Christie also suspended funding for the Department of the Public Advocate and called for its elimination. [ 51 ] Some Democrats criticized Christie for not first consulting them on his budget cuts and for circumventing the Legislature&apos;s role in the budget process. [ 52 ] In late June 2011, Christie utilized New Jersey&apos;s line item veto to eliminate nearly $1 billion from the proposed budget, signing it into law just hours prior to the July 1, 2011, beginning of the state&apos;s fiscal year. [ 53 ] 

On August 25, 2010, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services announced $400 million in federal Race to the Top education grants to New Jersey would not be funded due to a clerical error in the state&apos;s application made by an unidentified mid-level state official. Christie responded by saying the Obama administration bureaucracy had overstepped its authority and that the error lay in an administration failure to communicate with the New Jersey government. [ 54 ] However, information later came to light that the issue had already been raised with Christie&apos;s Education Commissioner Bret Schundler , and in response Christie had asked for Schundler&apos;s resignation; Schundler initially agreed to resign, but the following morning asked to be fired instead, citing his need to claim unemployment benefits. Schundler maintains that he told Christie the truth and that Christie is misstating what actually occurred. [ 55 ] The New Jersey Education Association rebuked Christie by suggesting that his rejection of a compromise worked out by Schundler with the teachers&apos; union on May 27 was to blame.

During his second year in office, Christie signed into law a payroll tax cut that is projected to save workers $190 million in taxes. Effective for calendar year 2012, the tax cut approved by Christie authorizes the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development to calculate a new payroll deduction rate to finance the Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) fund. As a result, most workers will see their TDI income tax reduced from $148 to $61 per year, for a savings of $87 per worker. The changes took effect on January 1, 2012. [ 56 ] The authorizing legislation was sponsored by Senator Shirley Turner of Lawrenceville.

On January 23, 2012, Christie filed the first nomination to the New Jersey Supreme Court of an openly gay man, Bruce Harris , and an Asian American, Phillip Kwon. [ 57 ] Kwon&apos;s nomination was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the first gubernatorial nominee for the Supreme Court in modern times to fail to be approved. [ 58 ] Two months later, the Senate Judiciary rejected the nomination of Bruce Harris, purportedly on grounds that he lacked courtroom experience. [ 59 ] The partisan impasse over Christie&apos;s appointments to fill the vacancies on the New Jersey Supreme Court continues.

On February 17, 2012, he vetoed a bill that would have legalized same sex marriage in New Jersey. He stated his belief that such a change requires a constitutional amendment and asked the legislature to provide for a referendum on the issue. He also called for creation of an ombudsman to ensure compliance with the state&apos;s existing civil union law. [ 60 ] 

Continuing the tradition of earlier New Jersey governors since the 1980s, Christie traveled to Israel in April 2012. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Media reported his itinerary as including Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , Tiberius , and the Golan Heights . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The official title given to the trip was &quot;Jersey to Jerusalem Trade Mission: Economic Growth, Diplomacy, Observance&quot;. [ 65 ] The visit to Israel was Christie&apos;s first official overseas trip since taking office. [ 66 ] During the visit, which included meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres , Christie commented that &quot;[Jerusalem] has never been better or freer than under Israeli control.&quot; [ 67 ] [ 68 ] From Israel Christie continued with his family to Jordan , as guests of King Abdullah II . [ 69 ] 

 Consideration of presidential run in 2012 election [link] 

Christie was the subject of ongoing speculation that he would attempt a run for President of the United States in 2012 by competing in the Republican primaries . He consistently denied any interest in launching a presidential bid. In September 2011, a number of press stories cited unnamed sources indicating Christie was reconsidering his decision to stay out of the race. An Associated Press story dated September 30 indicated a decision on whether he would run for president in 2012 would be made &quot;soon&quot;. [ 70 ] In a late September speech at the Reagan Library , he had again said he was not a candidate for president, but the speech also coincided with his &quot;reconsideration&quot; of the negative decision. One commentator at that time reviewed reported support from David H. and Charles G. Koch , Kenneth Langone , and others for Christie&apos;s potential candidacy. [ 22 ] Retired GE CEO Jack Welch went on Charlie Rose to articulate his and others&apos; support for a candidacy, [ 71 ] and Langone went on the interview show October 4. [ 72 ] 

On October 4, 2011, Christie acknowledged he had in fact reconsidered his decision but then, again, declined to run. [ 73 ] It was &quot;for real this time&quot;, as one report put it. &quot;Now is not my time,&quot; Christie said. [ 74 ] &quot;New Jersey, whether you like it or not, you&apos;re stuck with me,&quot; Christie added in the one-hour Trenton press conference held to announce the decision. [ 75 ] 

On October 11, 2011, Christie endorsed Mitt Romney for President of the United States. [ 76 ]

 Dennis John Kucinich (   / k uː ˈ s ɪ n ɪ tʃ / ; born October 8, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for Ohio&apos;s 10th congressional district , serving since 1997. He was furthermore a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections . [ 1 ] 

The district includes most of western Cleveland as well as suburbs such as Parma and Lakewood . He is a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce .

From 1977 to 1979, Kucinich served as the 53rd mayor of Cleveland , Ohio, a tumultuous term in which he survived a recall election and was successful in a battle against selling the municipal electric utility before being defeated for reelection by George Voinovich .

Through his various governmental positions and campaigns, Kucinich has attracted attention for consistently delivering &quot;the strongest liberal&quot; perspective. [ 2 ] This perspective has been shown by his actions, such as bringing articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , and being the only Democratic candidate in the 2008 election to have voted against invading Iraq [ 3 ] , although eventual nominee Barack Obama had also opposed the Iraq War at the time it was started, even though he had not been in Congress at the time.

Due to redistricting by the Republican-controlled state legislature following the 2010 state elections, Ohio&apos;s 9th congressional district absorbed part of Cuyahoga County , abolishing Kucinich&apos;s district and pitting him against 9th district incumbent Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 Democratic primary, which he lost.

 Personal life [link] 
 Dennis and Elizabeth Kucinich in 2008 
Kucinich was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 8, 1946, as the eldest of the seven children of Frank and Virginia Kucinich. [ 9 ] His father, a truck driver , was of Croat ancestry; his Irish American mother was a homemaker . [ 10 ] Growing up, his family moved 21 times and Dennis was often charged with the responsibility of finding apartments they could afford. [ 11 ] 

He attended Cleveland State University from 1967 to 1970. [ 12 ] In 1973, he graduated from Case Western Reserve University with both a Bachelor and a Master of Arts degree in speech and communication. [ 13 ] Kucinich was baptized a Roman Catholic . [ 12 ] Kucinich married Sandra Lee McCarthy in 1977; they had a daughter named Jackie in 1981 and divorced in 1986. [ 14 ] He married his third wife, Elizabeth Harper , a British citizen , on August 21, 2005. The two met while Harper was working as an assistant for the Chicago-based American Monetary Institute , which brought her to Kucinich&apos;s House of Representatives office for a meeting. [ 15 ] 

Dennis was raised with four brothers, Larry, Frank, Gary and Perry; and two sisters, Theresa and Beth Ann. On December 19, 2007, Perry Kucinich, the youngest brother, was found dead in his apartment. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] On November 11, 2008, his youngest sister, Beth Ann Kucinich, also died. [ 19 ] 


 Early career [link] 

Kucinich&apos;s political career began early. After running unsuccessfully in 1967, Kucinich was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1969 at the age of twenty-three. [ 10 ] In 1972, Kucinich ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing narrowly to incumbent Republican William E. Minshall, Jr. After Minshall&apos;s retirement in 1974 Kucinich sought the seat again, this time failing to get the Democratic nomination, which instead went to Ronald M. Mottl . Kucinich ran as an Independent candidate in the general election , placing third with about 30% of the vote. In 1975, Kucinich became clerk of the municipal court in Cleveland and served in that position for two years. [ 20 ] 

 Cleveland mayoralty [link] 
 Main article: Mayoral administration of Dennis Kucinich 
Kucinich was elected Mayor of Cleveland in 1977 and served in that position until 1979. [ 21 ] At thirty-one years of age, he was the youngest mayor of a major city in the United States , [ 10 ] earning him the nickname &quot;the boy mayor of Cleveland&quot;. [ 22 ] Kucinich&apos;s tenure as mayor is often regarded as one of the most tumultuous in Cleveland&apos;s history. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] After Kucinich refused to sell Muni Light , Cleveland&apos;s publicly owned electric utility, the Cleveland mafia put out a hit on Kucinich. A hit man from Maryland planned to shoot him in the head during the Columbus Day Parade , but the plot fell apart when Kucinich was hospitalized and missed the event. When the city fell into default shortly thereafter, the mafia leaders called off the contract killer. [ 24 ] 

Specifically, it was the Cleveland Trust Company that suddenly required all of the city&apos;s debts be paid in full, which forced the city into default, after news of Kucinich&apos;s refusal to sell the city utility. For years, these debts were routinely rolled over, pending future payment, until Kucinich&apos;s announcement was made public. In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored him for having had the &quot;courage and foresight&quot; to stand up to the banks, which saved the city an estimated $195 million between 1985 and 1995. [ 25 ] 

 Post-mayoralty [link] 

After losing his re-election bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept a low profile in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles , California , where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine . [ 26 ] During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. [ 12 ] It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. [ 26 ] On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. [ 26 ] When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, &quot;When I was growing up in Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It&apos;s one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through.&quot; [ 26 ] 

In 1982, Kucinich moved back to Cleveland and ran for Secretary of State ; however, he lost the Democratic primary to Sherrod Brown . [ 26 ] In 1983, Kucinich won a special election to fill the seat of a Cleveland city councilman who had died. [ 27 ] His brother, Gary Kucinich, was also a councilman at the time.

In 1985, there was some speculation that Kucinich might run for mayor again. Instead, his brother Gary ran against (and lost to) the incumbent Voinovich. Kucinich, meanwhile, gave up his council position to run for Governor of Ohio as an independent against Richard Celeste , but later withdrew from the race. [ 27 ] After this, Kucinich, in his own words &quot;on a quest for meaning,&quot; lived quietly in New Mexico until 1994, when he won a seat in the Ohio State Senate . [ 27 ] 

 House of Representatives [link] 

In 1996, Kucinich was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 10th district of Ohio . He defeated two-term Republican incumbent Martin Hoke by three percentage points. However, he has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has since been re-elected six times. [ 28 ]

 Domestic policy voting record [link] 
 Main article: Political positions of Dennis Kucinich Kucinich outside the Capitol in June 2007 
Kucinich helped introduce and is one of 93 cosponsors (as of Feb. 22, 2010) in the House of Representatives of the United States National Health Care Act or HR 676 proposed by Rep. John Conyers in 2003, [ 29 ] which provides for a universal single-payer public health-insurance plan.

In 2008, Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives against President George W. Bush for the invasion and occupation of Iraq . [ 30 ] 

Although his voting record is not always in line with that of the Democratic Party , on March 17, 2010, after being courted by President Barack Obama , his wife and others, he reluctantly agreed to vote with his colleagues for the Healthcare Bill without a public option component. [ 31 ] 

Kucinich voted against the USA PATRIOT Act , against the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , [ 32 ] and was one of six who voted against the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Act . [ 33 ] He also voted for authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds existed for the impeachment of Bill Clinton . [ 34 ] 

Kucinich criticized the flag-burning amendment and voted against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton . His congressional voting record has leaned strongly toward a pro-life stance, although he noted that he has never supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion altogether. In 2003, however, he began describing himself as pro-choice and said he had shifted away from his earlier position on the issue. [ 35 ] Press releases have indicated that he is pro-choice and supports ending the abstinence-only policy of sex education and increasing the use of contraception to make abortion &quot;less necessary&quot; over time. His voting record since 2003 has reflected mixed ratings from abortion rights groups. [ 36 ] 

He has criticized Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions ) for promoting voting machines that fail to leave a traceable paper trail. [ 37 ] He was one of the thirty-one who voted in the House to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the United States presidential election, 2004 . [ 38 ] 


 Foreign policy record [link] 
 An earlier Congressional photo of Kucinich 
Kucinich has criticized the foreign policy of President Bush , including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and what he perceives as growing American hostility towards Iran . He has always voted against funding it. In 2005, he voted against the Iran Freedom and Support Act , calling it a &quot;stepping stone to war&quot;. [ 39 ] He also signed a letter of solidarity with Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 2004. [ 40 ] 

He advocates the abolition of all nuclear weapons , calling on the United States to be the leader in multilateral disarmament. [ 41 ] Kucinich has also strongly opposed space-based weapons and has sponsored legislation, HR 2977, banning the deployment and use of space-based weapons . [ 42 ] 

Kucinich advocates US withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because, in his view, it causes the loss of more American jobs than it creates, and does not provide adequate protections for worker rights and safety and environmental safeguards. He is against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for the same reason. [ 43 ] 

Kucinich is also in favor of increased dialog with Iran in order to avoid a militaristic confrontation at all costs. He expressed such sentiments at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey which included Chuck Hagel , Javad Zarif , Nicholas Kristof , and Anders Liden to discuss Iranian-American relations , and potential ways to increase dialog in order to avoid conflict. [ 44 ] 

He believes the US should move aggressively to reduce emissions that cause climate change due to global warming [ 45 ] and should ratify the Kyoto Protocol , a major international agreement signed by over 160 countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by each signatory. [ 46 ] 

Kucinich and Ron Paul are the only two congressional representatives who voted [ 47 ] against the Rothman - Kirk Resolution, [ 48 ] which calls on the United Nations to charge Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the genocide convention of the United Nations Charter based on statements that he has made. Kucinich defended his vote by saying that Ahmadinejad&apos;s statements could be translated to mean that he wants a regime change in Israel , not death to its people and supporters, and that the resolution is an attempt to beat &quot;the war drum to build support for a US attack on Iran.&quot; [ 49 ] In October 2009, Kucinich and Ron Paul were the only two congressional representatives to vote against H.Res.175 condemning the government of Iran for “state-sponsored persecution of its Bahá’í minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights.”

On January 9, 2009, Kucinich was one of the dissenters in a 390-5 vote with 22 abstentions for a resolution recognizing Israel &apos;s &quot;right to defend itself [against Hamas rocket attacks ]&quot; and reaffirming the U.S.&apos;s support for Israel . The other 4 &quot;no&quot; votes were Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, Maxine Waters of California, Nick Rahall of West Virginia, and Ron Paul of Texas. [ 50 ] 

Kucinich is the only congressional representative to vote against [ 51 ] the symbolic &quot;9/11 Commemoration&quot; resolution. [ 52 ] In a press statement [ 53 ] he defended his vote by saying that the bill did not make reference to &quot;the lies that took us into Iraq, the lies that keep us there, the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home.&quot;

In a visit to the rest of the Middle East in September 2007, Kucinich said he did not visit Iraq because &quot;I feel the United States is engaging in an illegal occupation.&quot; [ 54 ] Kucinich was criticized for his visit to Syria and praise of the President Bashar al-Assad on Syria&apos;s national TV. [ 55 ] He praised Syria for taking in Iraqi refugees. &quot;What most people are not aware of is that Syria has taken in more than 1.5 million Iraqi refugees,&quot; Kucinich said. &quot;The Syrian government has actually shown a lot of compassion in keeping its doors open, and being a host for so many refugees.&quot; [ 56 ] 

Despite Kucinich&apos;s committed opposition to the war in Iraq , in the days after the September 11, 2001 attacks he did vote to authorize President Bush broad war making powers, [ 57 ] the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists . The Authorization was used by the Bush Administration in its justification for suspension of habeas corpus in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and its wiretapping of American citizens under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . Kucinich voted along with 419 of his House colleagues in favor of this resolution, while only one Congresswoman opposed, Representative Barbara Lee .

In March 2010, the House rejected a Kucinich resolution regarding the War in Afghanistan by a vote of 356-65. [ 58 ] The resolution would have required the Obama administration to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Kucinich reportedly based the resolution on the War Powers Resolution of 1973. [ 59 ] 

In March 2011, Kucinich criticized the Obama administration&apos;s decision to participate in the UN intervention in Libya without Congressional authorization . He also called it an &quot;indisputable fact&quot; that President Obama&apos;s decision is an impeachable offense since he believes the U.S. Constitution &quot;does not provide for the president to wage war any times he pleases,&quot; although he has not yet introduced a resolution to impeach Obama. [ 61 ] In response, Libyan officials invited Kucinich to visit that country on a &quot;peace mission&quot;, but he declined, stating that he &quot;could not negotiate on behalf of the administration.&quot; [ 62 ] 

 2004 Presidential campaign [link] 
 Kucinich speaks out against the occupation of Iraq at the 2004 Democratic National Convention . 
Kucinich was criticized during his 2004 campaign for changing his stance on the issue of abortion. [ 35 ] His explanation was &quot;I&apos;ve always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women to be able to have an abortion if they need to protect their health. So when I saw the direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose.&quot; [ 63 ] 

 Ralph Nader praised Kucinich as &quot;a genuine progressive&quot;, [ citation needed ] and most Greens were friendly to Kucinich&apos;s campaign, some going so far as to indicate that they would not have run against him had he won the Democratic nomination. However, Kucinich was unable to carry any states in the 2004 Democratic Primaries, and John Kerry eventually won the Democratic nomination at the Democratic National Convention .

 Press coverage [link] 

On December 10, 2003, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced the removal of its correspondents from the campaigns of Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton . [ 64 ] 

The announcement came one day after a Democratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News&apos; Ted Koppel , in which Koppel asked whether the candidacies of Kucinich, Moseley Braun and Sharpton were merely &quot;vanity campaigns&quot;, and Koppel and Kucinich exchanged uncomfortable dialog. [ 65 ] 

Kucinich, previously critical of the limited coverage given his campaign, characterized ABC&apos;s decision as an example of media companies&apos; power to shape campaigns by choosing which candidates to cover and questioned its timing, coming immediately after the debate. [ 64 ] 

 ABC News , while stating its commitment to give coverage to a wide range of candidates, argued that focusing more of its &quot;finite resources&quot; on those candidates most likely to win would best serve the public debate. [ 65 ] 

 Polls and primaries [link] 

In the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination race , national polls consistently showed Kucinich&apos;s support in single digits, but rising, especially as Howard Dean lost some support among peace activists for refusing to commit to cutting the Pentagon budget. Though he was not viewed as a viable contender by most, there were differing polls on Kucinich&apos;s popularity.

He placed second in MoveOn.org &apos;s primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, particularly Internet -based ones. This led many activists to believe that his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls had been saying. However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.

In the Iowa caucuses , he finished fifth, receiving about 1% of the state delegates from Iowa ; far below the 15% threshold for receiving national delegates. He performed similarly in the New Hampshire primary , placing sixth among the seven candidates with 1% of the vote. In the Mini-Tuesday primaries, he finished near the bottom in most states, with his best performance in New Mexico where he received less than 6% of the vote, and still no delegates. Kucinich&apos;s best showing in any Democratic contest was in the February 24 Hawaii caucus, in which he won 31% of caucus participants, coming in second place to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and winning Maui County , the only county won by Kucinich in either of his presidential campaigns. He also saw a double-digit showing in Maine on February 8, where he got 16% percent in that state&apos;s caucus.

On Super Tuesday , March 2, Kucinich gained another strong showing with the Minnesota caucus, where 17% of the ballots went to him. In his home state of Ohio, he gained 9% in the primary.

Kucinich campaigned heavily in Oregon , spending 30 days there during the two months leading up to the state&apos;s May 18 primary . He continued his campaign because &quot;the future direction of the Democratic Party has not yet been determined&quot; [ 66 ] and chose to focus on Oregon &quot;because of its progressive tradition and its pioneering spirit.&quot; [ 67 ] He won 16% of the vote.

Even after Kerry won enough delegates to secure the nomination, Kucinich continued to campaign until just before the convention, citing an effort to help shape the agenda of the Democratic Party. He was the last candidate to end his campaign. He endorsed Kerry on July 22, four days before the start of the Democratic National Convention. [ 68 ] 

 2008 Presidential campaign [link] 
 Main article: Dennis Kucinich presidential campaign, 2008 Kucinich speaking on the campaign trail, January 2007. 
On December 11, 2006 in a speech delivered at Cleveland City Hall, Kucinich announced he would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party for President in 2008. His platform [ 69 ] for 2008 included:

 Creating a single-payer not-for-profit system of universal health care that provides full coverage for all Americans by passage of the United States National Health Care Act . The immediate, phased withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq; replacing them with an international security force. Guaranteed quality education for all; including free pre-kindergarten and college for all who want it. Immediate withdrawal from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Immediate repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act . Fostering a world of international cooperation.

Legalizing same-sex marriage . Strongly promoting workers&apos; rights. Ending the H-1B and L-1 visa Programs Restoring rural communities and family farms . Strengthening gun control . Legalizing medicinal marijuana and decriminalizing non-medical possession. 

Kucinich described his stance on the issues as mainstream. [ 70 ] 

Kucinich told his supporters in Iowa that if he did not appear on the second ballot in any caucus that they should back Barack Obama :
 
&quot;I hope Iowans will caucus for me as their first choice ... because of my singular positions on the war, on health care and trade,&quot; Kucinich said. &quot;But in those caucus locations where my support doesn&apos;t reach the necessary threshold, I strongly encourage all of my supporters to make Barack Obama their second choice.&quot; [ 71 ] [ 72 ] 
 
At a debate of Democratic presidential candidates in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC &apos;s Tim Russert cited a passage from a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO from her home in Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine&apos;s assertion was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former US president Jimmy Carter has. [ 73 ] Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans say they have witnessed a UFO. [ 73 ] 

On November 16, 2007, Larry Flynt hosted a fundraiser for Kucinich at the Los Angeles -based Hustler - LFP headquarters , attended by Kucinich and his wife, which has drawn criticism from Flynt&apos;s detractors. Attendees included such notables as Edward Norton , Woody Harrelson , Sean Penn , Robin Wright Penn , Melissa Etheridge , Tammy Etheridge , Stephen Stills , Kristen Stills, Frances Fisher , and Esai Morales . Campaign representatives declined to comment. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] 

In December 2007, author Gore Vidal endorsed Kucinich for president. [ 76 ] 

Kucinich&apos;s 2008 presidential campaign was advised by a steering committee including Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) Founder Steve Cobble, long-time Kucinich press secretary Andy Junewicz, former RFK, McCarthy, Humphrey, McGovern and Carter political consultant Michael Carmichael, former Carter Fundraiser Marcus Brandon, Ani DiFranco Tour Manager Susan Alzner, West Point Graduate and former Army Captain Mike Klein, former Communications Director of Democrats Abroad Sharon Manitta and New Jersey -based political consultant Vin Gopal. The campaign was seen as a platform to push progressive issues into the Democratic Party, including a not-for-profit health care system , same-sex marriage, increasing the minimum wage , opposing capital punishment, and impeachment.

On Monday, January 7, 2008 actor Viggo Mortensen endorsed Kucinich&apos;s presidential campaign in New Hampshire . [ 77 ] On Thursday, January 10, 2008, Kucinich asked for a New Hampshire recount based on discrepancies between the machine-counted ballots and the hand-counted ballots. He stated that he wanted to make sure &quot;100% of the voters had 100% of their votes counted.&quot; [ 78 ] 

On Tuesday, January 15, 2008, Kucinich was &quot;disinvited&quot; from a Democratic presidential debate on MSNBC . A ruling that the debate could not go ahead without Kucinich was overturned on appeal. [ 79 ] Kucinich later responded to the questions posed in the MSNBC debate in a show hosted by Democracy Now! [ 80 ] 

Kucinich dropped his bid for the Democratic nomination on Thursday, January 24, 2008, and did not endorse any other candidate. He later endorsed Barack Obama after he had won the nomination. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] On Friday, January 25, 2008, he made a formal announcement of the end of his campaign for president and his focus on reelection to Congress. [ 83 ] 
 Kucinich gestures to the audience following his speech on the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver , Colorado . 
On August 27, 2008, he delivered a widely publicized speech at the Democratic National Convention . [ 84 ] 

 Congressional campaigns [link] 

Kucinich has always been reelected to Congress by sound margins in his strongly Democratic-leaning district. Kucinich has so far won primary challenges against him for the Democratic nomination convincingly.

 2006 [link] 

Kucinich defeated another Democratic primary challenger by a wide margin and defeated Republican Mike Dovilla in the general election with 66% of the vote.

 2008 [link] 
 See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2008#District 10 
His opponents included Cleveland City Councilman Joe Cimperman and North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O&apos;Grady. In February 2008 Kucinich raised around $50,000 compared to Cimperman&apos;s $228,000, [ 85 ] but through a YouTube money raising campaign he managed to raise $700,000, surpassing Cimperman&apos;s $487,000. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] 

Cimperman, who was endorsed by the Mayor of Cleveland and The Plain Dealer , criticized Kucinich for focusing too much on campaigning for president and not on the district. Kucinich accused Cimperman of representing corporate and real estate interests. Cimperman described Kucinich as an absentee congressman who failed to pass any major legislative initiatives in his 12-year House career. In an interview, Cimperman said he was tired of Kucinich and Cleveland being joke fodder for late-night talk-show hosts, saying &quot;It&apos;s time for him to go home.&quot; [ 88 ] [ 89 ] An ad paid for by Cimperman&apos;s campaign stated that Kucinich has missed over 300 votes, but by checking the ad&apos;s source, the actual number was 139. [ 90 ] However, Kucinich is well known for his constituency service. [ 91 ] 

A report suggested that representatives of Nancy Pelosi and American Israel Public Affairs Committee would &quot;guarantee&quot; Kucinich&apos;s re-election if he dropped his bid to impeach Dick Cheney and George W. Bush , though Kucinich denies the meeting happened. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] It was also suggested that Kucinich&apos;s calls for universal health care and an immediate withdrawal from Iraq made him a thorn in the side of the Democrats&apos; congressional leadership, as well as his refusal to pledge to support the eventual presidential nominee, which he later reconsidered. [ 88 ] 

Kucinich took part in a debate with the other primary challengers. Barbara Ferris criticized him for not bringing as much money back to the district as other area legislators and authoring just one bill that passed during his 12 years in Congress. Kucinich responded &quot;It was a Republican Congress and there weren&apos;t many Democrats passing meaningful legislation during a Republican Congress.&quot; [ 94 ] 

Kucinich won the primary, receiving 68,156 votes out of 135,589 cast to beat Cimperman 52% to 33%. [ 95 ] 

Kucinich defeated former State Representative Jim Trakas in the November 4, 2008 general election with 153,357 votes, 56.8% of those cast.

 2010 [link]

Kucinich defeated Republican nominee Peter J. Corrigan and Libertarian nominee Jeff Goggins in the November 2, 2010 general election with 101,343 votes, 53.1% of those cast. [ 96 ] 

 2012 [link] 
 See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 9 
 Redistricting by the Republican-controlled state legislature threw Kucinich into the same district as another Democratic incumbent, Marcy Kaptur . The two competed in the Democratic primary on March 6, 2012, but Kucinich lost after an increasingly-bitter campaign. Kucinich had been endorsed by another House member, Barney Frank of Massachusetts . [ 97 ] 

 Political positions [link] 
 Main article: Political positions of Dennis Kucinich 
Based on his voting record in Congress, the American Conservative Union (ACU) gave Kucinich a conservative rating of 9.73%, [ 98 ] and for 2008, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) gave him a liberal rating of 95%. [ 99 ] 

 Monetary reform [link] 

In the aftermath of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , Kucinich has called for the Federal Reserve System to be put under control of U.S. Treasury . [ 100 ] Additionally, banks shall no longer be allowed to create money, putting an end to fractional-reserve banking . [ 101 ] He cites Stephen Zarlenga as the initiator of that proposal.

 Plan for Iraq [link] 

On January 8, 2007 Kucinich unveiled his comprehensive exit plan to bring the troops home and stabilize Iraq. His plan includes the following steps: [ 102 ] 

 Announce that the US will end the occupation, close the military bases, and withdraw. Announce that existing funds will be used to bring the troops and the necessary equipment home. Order a simultaneous return of all US contractors to the US and turn over the contracting work to the Iraqi government . Convene a regional conference for developing a security and stabilization force for Iraq. Prepare an international security peacekeeping force to replace US troops, who then return home. Develop and fund a process of national reconciliation. Restart programs for reconstruction and creating jobs for the Iraqi people . Provide reparations for the damage that has been done to the lives of Iraqis. Assure the political sovereignty of Iraq and ensure that their oil is not stolen. Repair the Iraqi economy . Guarantee economic sovereignty for Iraq. Commence an international truth and reconciliation process, which establishes a policy of truth and reconciliation between the people of the US and Iraq. 

Kucinich has criticized the Bush administration for supporting the People&apos;s Mujahedin of Iran terrorist group in Iraq and other insurgent groups that have attacked the Iranian state. [ 103 ] 

 Space Preservation Act of 2001 [link] 

Kucinich introduced the first Space Preservation Act, on October 2, 2001, with no cosponsors. The bill was designed to &quot;preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind.&quot; The bill was referred to the House Science , the House Armed Services , and the House International Relations committees . The bill died in committee (April 9, 2002) because of an unfavorable executive comment received from the Department of Defense . [ 104 ] 

 Impeachment proceedings against Dick Cheney [link] 
 Main article: Attempted impeachment of Dick Cheney 
 Wikinews has related news: Democrat submits resolution to impeach Cheney 

 Wikisource has original text related to this article: US House Resolution 333 

On April 17, 2007, Kucinich sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues saying that he planned to file impeachment proceedings against Dick Cheney , then Vice President of the United States . [ 105 ] Kucinich planned to introduce the impeachment articles on April 24, 2007, but in light of Cheney&apos;s visit to his doctor for an inspection of a blood clot , Kucinich decided to postpone the scheduled press conference &quot;until the vice president&apos;s condition is clarified.&quot; [ 106 ] 

Kucinich held a press conference on the evening of April 24, 2007, revealing House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Cheney. He charges Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq&apos;s weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq&apos;s connection to al-Qaeda , and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence , and stated: &quot;I believe the Vice President&apos;s conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation. Today, I have introduced House Resolution 333, Articles of Impeachment Relating to Vice President Richard B. Cheney. I do so in defense of the rights of the American people to have a government that is honest and peaceful.&quot; [ 107 ] 

During the first Democratic Presidential debate at South Carolina State University , [ 108 ] none of the other candidates&apos; hands went up when the moderator, Brian Williams , asked if they would support Kucinich&apos;s plan to impeach Cheney. In response, Kucinich retrieved a pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution from his coat and expressed the importance of protecting and defending constitutional principles.
 This is a pocket copy of the Constitution which I carry with me, because I took an oath to defend the Constitution. We&apos;ve spent a lot of time talking about Iraq here tonight and America&apos;s role in the world. This country was taken into war based on lies. This country was taken into war based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and Al Qaeda&apos;s role with respect to Iraq, which there wasn&apos;t one at the time we went in. I want to state that Mr. Cheney must be held accountable. He is already ginning up a cause for war against Iran. Now, we have to stand for this Constitution, we have to protect and defend this Constitution. And this vice president has violated this Constitution. So I think that while my friends on the stage may not be ready to take this stand, the American people should know that there&apos;s at least one person running for president who wants to reconnect America with its goodness, with its greatness, with its highest principles, which currently are not being reflected by those who are in the White House. —Dennis Kucinich,  New York Times , April 27, 2007 [ 109 ] 
By January 29, 2008, 24 other Congressional representatives became cosponsors. [ 110 ] Six of these were members of the House Judiciary Committee : Tammy Baldwin , Keith Ellison , Hank Johnson , Maxine Waters , Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson-Lee . In addition, Congressman Robert Wexler , supported by Representatives Luis Gutierrez and Tammy Baldwin, began openly calling for impeachment hearings to begin.

 Cheney impeachment articles introduced [link] 

On November 6, 2007, Kucinich used special parliamentary procedure and moved for a vote on impeaching the Vice President. [ 111 ] House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Pelosi opposed the measure and stood by previous comments that, &quot;impeachment is not on our agenda,&quot; and they initially moved to table the bill. When that attempt failed, Mr. Hoyer quickly moved to refer the bill to the House Judiciary Committee. That motion succeeded. [ 111 ] 

 Opposition to H1B/L1 visa programs [link] 

Kucinich has been a vocal opponent of the H1B and L1 visa programs. In an article on his campaign website, he states: [ 112 ] 
 The expanded use of H-1B and L-1 visas has had a negative effect on the workplace of Information Technology workers in America. It has caused a reduction in wages. It has forced workers to accept deteriorating working conditions and allowed U.S. companies to concentrate work in technical and geographic areas that American workers consider undesirable. It has also reduced the number of IT jobs held by Americans. 
 Plan to ban handguns [link] 

In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre in Blacksburg , Virginia , Kucinich proposed a plan that he says would address violence in America. Kucinich is currently drafting legislation that includes a ban on the purchase, sale, transfer, or possession of handguns by civilians. [ 113 ] 

The congressman has pushed for gun control, even as a city councilman. He kept a pistol in his house for a period in 1978 (under the recommendation of the police) when he was the target of a Mafia plot. He no longer keeps the pistol. [ 114 ] 

 Support for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine [link] 

Kucinich is also involved in efforts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine , requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time , which he and other critics of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney , Vermont&apos;s independent Senator Bernie Sanders , and others have joined him in this effort. [ 115 ] Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood , academia , new media , and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] 

 Animal welfare and rights [link] 

Kucinich addresses the issue of factory farming in his policy encouraging independent, family-owned, and organic farming . This would help lead to &quot;the meat that we consume coming from happy and healthy free-range animals,&quot; Kucinich states on his campaign website. [ 119 ] 

Kucinich is one of the few vegans in Congress. [ 9 ] He has maintained a diet for many years that excludes animal products in accordance with his conviction that &quot;all life on our Earth [is] sacred.&quot; [ 119 ] [ 120 ] 

 Free Market Drug Act [link] 

Kucinich believes that the prices for patented drugs are unreasonably high, and that patent monopolies have created a restricted, unfree drug market. &quot;Simply put, if drug manufacturers were operating in a free market like most other businesses in the US, drug prices would be significantly lower.&quot; On September 29, 2004, he introduced H.R. 5155, the Free Market Drug Act ; a system where the National Institutes of Health would fund research, thus disconnecting the manufacturing of drugs from research and increasing competition among private manufacturers. [ 121 ] 

 Energy policy [link] 

As mayor of Cleveland in the 1970s, Kucinich favored the city&apos;s existing Municipal Light System and opposed construction of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant and Perry Nuclear Power Plant on Lake Erie . Kucinich opposed a planned regional radioactive waste dump, and has long advocated renewable energy and efficient energy use . [ 122 ] 

In 2010 Kucinich stated that new nuclear reactors are not cost-effective, and that they are a slow way of meeting electricity needs as it takes five or six years for new reactors to come on line. He also said that new nuclear reactors are a risky way to meet electricity needs. [ 123 ] 

 Attempts to impeach George W. Bush [link] 
 Main article: Movement to impeach George W. Bush 
On June 10, 2008, Kucinich introduced 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush on the floor of the House of Representatives. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] On June 11, the resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee .

Calling it &quot;a sworn duty&quot; of Congress to act, co-sponsor Robert Wexler stated: &quot;President Bush deliberately created a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people and the charges detailed in this impeachment resolution indicate an unprecedented abuse of executive power.&quot; [ 127 ] 

On July 10, 2008, Kucinich introduced an additional article of impeachment accusing Bush of misleading Congress into war. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] 

On July 14, 2008 Kucinich introduced a new resolution of impeachment against George W. Bush, charging him with manufacturing evidence to sway public opinion in favor of the war in Iraq. This resolution was also sent to the judiciary committee.

Democratic leaders Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi opposed the impeachment efforts. [ citation needed ] None of them ever progressed to a full House vote.

 Youth rights [link] 

In a Democratic debate during the 2008 Presidential Election, Kucinich and Mike Gravel were the only two candidates who favored lowering the legal drinking age to 18 as it is in the vast majority of the world. Kucinich further said that the voting age should be lowered to 16. [ 131 ] 

 Military intervention in Libya [link] 

Kucinich objected to the 2011 military intervention in Libya missile strikes and questioned whether they weren&apos;t impeachable offenses. Kucinich also questioned why Democratic leaders didn’t object when President Barack Obama told them of his plan for US participation in enforcing the Libyan no-fly zone. He said Obama&apos;s action in Libya was &quot;a grave decision that cannot be made by the president alone&quot;, and stated that failing to first seek approval of Congress was in violation of the Constitution . [ 132 ] [ 133 ] 

On August 31, Al Jazeera reported that a document had been found in the headquarters of the Libyan intelligence agency which according to the author appears to be a summary of a conversation between Kucinich and an intermediary for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in which the congressman asked for informations about the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC), possible links of it to al-Qaeda and corruption evidences, to lobby US lawmakers to put an end to NATO airstrikes and suspend their support for the NTC. [ 134 ] It also listed information necessary to defend Saif al-Islam against International Criminal Court war crimes charges. [ 134 ] Kucinich defended himself in a message to The Atlantic Wire , saying that the document in question is simply a summary of Kucinich&apos;s public positions on the Libyan campaign by a Libyan bureaucrat who never consulted with Kucinich himself. &quot;Al Jazeera found a document written by a Libyan bureaucrat to other Libyan bureaucrats. All it proves is that the Libyans were reading the Washington Post... Any implication I was doing anything other than trying to bring an end to an unauthorised war is fiction.&quot; [ 134 ] [ 135 ] 

 Electoral history [link] 
 Main article: Electoral history of Dennis Kucinich 
 Recognition [link] 

In 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award , an annual award bestowed by the Religious Society of Friends -affiliated organization Promoting Enduring Peace . [ 9 ] 

After Kucinich lost to Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 Democratic primary, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said of Kucinich, &quot;At the end of the day, we’re really going to miss Dennis. Dennis is a transformative leader. He stood up and spoke eloquently, passionately about Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran. He was a consistent voice for peace... He almost didn’t vote for the health care bill because it wasn’t good enough.&quot; [ 136 ]

 The Liberty Bell Temple in Los Angeles, Hollywood Boulevard, founded by Edward Forchion in 2009 
 Robert Edward Forchion (born July 23, 1964), and also known as NJWEEDMAN , is a cannabis activist and a perennial candidate for various New Jersey elected offices. He is a resident of the Browns Mills section of Pemberton Township, New Jersey .

Forchion identifies himself as a member of the Legalize Marijuana Party and campaigns primarily on the single issue of cannabis legalization. Forchion has performed various stunts to bring attention to cannabis legalization, including smoking cannabis in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia , as well as attempting to legally change his name to NJWeedman.com. [ 1 ] As a result of such antics, Forchion has appeared before U.S. courts multiple times - both as a defendant facing marijuana possession charges, and a plaintiff in civil rights actions pertaining to marijuana advocacy and consumption.

 Life before politics and activism [link] 

In his online autobiography, [ 2 ] Forchion claims smoking his first marijuana cigarette at age 16; he &quot;instantly was impressed with its medicinal healing powers, in regards to his [asthma]&quot;. He also states in interview by The Trentonian : &quot;I was 15 when I first got busted for smoking weed by my parents. And to this day my mother is against it, and just wishes I would shut up about it.&quot; [ 3 ] 

In 1982, upon graduation from Edgewood Regional High School in Atco, New Jersey , he enlisted in the New Jersey National Guard and enrolled at Claflin College , Orangeburg, South Carolina . [ citation needed ] In 1986 he received an honorable discharge from the NJ National Guard and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps , and without marijuana, he had an asthma attack and was medically discharged. [ citation needed ] After being discharged from the Marine Corps , he changed his name to Edward and enlisted in the United States Army . While in the army he used cannabis despite the warnings from the government, to control his asthma. [ citation needed ] On April 18, 1988 he married his first wife Pam in Fort Bliss, Texas , and in 1990 he receive an honorable discharge from the army. He became a coast-to-coast trucker using his own truck he purchased in 1994.

According to his website, Forchion is a practicing Rastafarian . [ 2 ] 

He proudly admits he was a &quot;marijuana smuggler&quot; [ citation needed ] , driving hundreds of pounds of cannabis from Arizona border towns to east coast cities such as Cleveland, Ohio , Philadelphia, New York City and Camden, New Jersey . His Mexican/Cuban suppliers in Arizona were the first to dub him The New Jersey Weedman, because while other drugs were available for transport he only wanted to transport cannabis.

 Legal matters [link] 

Edward Forchion has several convictions, as well as a pending case, for marijuana possession. Forchion puts himself at risk for arrest for laws criminalizing the consumption, possession, and transport of the drug, as he interprets U.S. Constitutional protections on religions freedom to allows him to circumvent these laws. As outlined in the following sections, Forchion has challenged, and U.S. courts have so far rejected, his interpretation of the law: [ 4 ] 

 2000 marijuana conviction [link] 

On November 24, 1997, Forchion was arrested on marijuana trafficking charges by the Camden County Drug Task Force and locally-based DEA agents, after being found in possession of approximately 25 pounds (11.3 kilograms) of the drug. As trial commenced, a plea deal was offered: Forchion would plead guilty in exchange for a flat 10-year prison sentence. On September 20, 2000, he was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana by Judge Ronald Thompson and started his sentence. [ 5 ] 

Forchion was released after 17 months on April 3, 2002 into New Jersey&apos;s Intensive Supervision Parole (ISP). He was ordered forbidden from &quot;promoting the use of marijuana&quot; as a parole condition. Parole officers considered Forchion&apos;s speaking to the press, in specific, The Trentonian and &quot;various Philadelphia newspapers&quot;, as a violation of this condition. Furthermore, parole officers were informed that &quot;[Forchion] had been handing out fliers and protesting in front of the Burlington County Courthouse regarding the legalization of marijuana&quot;. Forchion was re-imprisoned because of this on June 6, 2002, only to be released four days later. Continuing to violate the conditions of his parole, Forchion contracted with Comcast Communications to air a series of marijuana-advocacy commercials, and continued updating his website, www.njweedman.com , which he was ordered to refrain from doing. Finally, on August 19, 2002, he was imprisoned in lieu of an ISP violation hearing scheduled for January 17, 2003. [ 5 ] 

Seeing that the parole violation was a restriction of his Constitutionally-protected First Amendment right to free speech , Forchion attempted to obtain relief in Federal court. He filed both a habeas corpus petition and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 First Amendment civil rights violation petition. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey then consolidated the actions; the Court then issued an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued reinstating the Plaintiff to the ISP program and oral argument was held on January 21, 2003. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas&apos;s determined that Forchion was precluded from appealing the ISP Resentencing Panel and raising his constitutional challenges. The injunction was granted, Forchion v. Intensive Supervision Parole, et.al. , 240 F.Supp.2d 302 (2003), freeing Forchion from prison and ordering ISP officials to give him forty-eight (48) hours notice of further intentions to violate his parole.

 2005 marijuana conviction [link] 

To celebrate his freedom, Forchion held monthly Rastafarian religious services at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, where he consumed marijuana at around 4:20PM. As a national monument under U.S. Park Service jurisdiction, this eventually resulted in a Federal case against Forchion that culminated in United States v. Forchion , when park rangers issued citations on multiple dates (December 20, 2003, March 20 and April 17, 2004) for possession of a controlled substance. He would use this case as an opportunity to argue that Constitutionally-protected freedom of religion allows Rastafarians to consume marijuana as a sacrament .

The case ended up in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , where a bench trial before a Magistrate Judge found Forchion guilty. On July 22, 2005, an appeal before District Judge Stewart Dalzell affirmed the convictions. Higher appeal to the U.S. 3rd Circuit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because appeal was not timely filed.

 DNA sample litigation [link] 

Forchion simultaneously fought the state of New Jersey&apos;s newly enacted DNA law, for several months his case put on hold the state&apos;s new DNA law. Eventually Forchion won his DNA case and was not obligated to surrender his DNA. [ 6 ] 

 Name change petition [link] 

The Camden County Prosecutor&apos;s Office and the State of New Jersey successfully fought his petition to legally change his name to that of his website: NJWeedman.com. Claiming his name would be an endorsement of criminal activity and led to other such name changes such as herionman, cocainemen etc., etc.,.. [ 7 ] 

 Name change petition #2 [link] 

In April of 2010 Forchion once again attempted to change his name legally to NJWEEDMAN.COM, this time in the State of California, at the trial the court ruled his &quot;.com&quot; name would be confusing and denied it. Forchion appealed to the California Appeals Court which upheld the denial. .,.. [ 8 ] 

 Move to California [link] 
 Liberty Bell Temple Lounge on Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles 
In 2008 Forchion fled to California seeking asylum, leaving the Garden State for the pot-friendly environs of Los Angeles. Forchion claimed he was living in political exile, having fled the official persecution of NJ State authorities for his political views on marijuana legalization. [ citation needed ] 

In 2009 he opened a Rastafarian Temple on Hollywood Blvd., named the Liberty Bell Temple II , after a series of protest he held at the Liberty bell in Philadelphia. At the Liberty Bell Temple he provided marijuana to hundreds of sick people every week, doing what he preached about in New Jersey. Being in Hollywood he quickly became a &quot;hollywood personia&quot;, providing marijuana to patients and celbrities alike. NJweedman opened a party promotions company called NJWEEDMANPROMOTIONS . He stopped calling himself a &quot;marijuana activist&quot; and instead insisting he was now a &quot;marijuana capitalist&quot;. He started hosting huge marijuana mansion parties in the Hollywood Hills where he openly provided marijuana to all the guests. The Television Show TMZ covered him three times in 2010.

In 2010 Forchion became an author, of his own biography titled NJweedman Super-heroes of the Potheads ISBN/1450530311 first published on Jan 18th, 2010 ironically the same day New Jersey legalized Marijuana for medical purposes making Forchion feel vindicated for his decade of activism.

In February 2011, Forchion made the cover of SPLIFF Magazine. The article, written by Alisia Bolivar (Vol. 3, Issue 1; page 42), discusses Forchion&apos;s most recent court case( April 1st 2010), jury nullification, a brief history of jury nullification, and Forchion&apos;s Rastafarian ministry in Los Angeles, California.

 Political ambitions [link] 

In 1998 as a way of supporting his planned Jury Nullification defense to the charges he was facing he announced the formation of the Legalize Marijuana Party and his intention to run for a seat on the Camden County Freeholders board and the first district Congressional seat. He now claims this was a successful tactic and has since continued to run for offices as a protest to the cannabis laws. Forchion now has a history of running for various state and federal offices as an independent candidate. Forchion has never been successful in any of his attempts for public office, which he acknowledges isn&apos;t even his goal.

 2005 Governor of New Jersey race [link] 

Forchion ran for Governor of New Jersey in 2005 under the slogan of “Legalize Marijuana (G.R.I.P.)- Get Rid of Incumbent Politicians”. As with his prior campaigns, Forchion ran largely on cannabis legislation. In his official statement mailed with the sample ballots to registered New Jersey voters, Forchion accuses the &quot;Christian Government and law enforcement officers who rely on this ungodly racist WAR ON DRUGS for their livelihoods&quot; as interfering with his rights to freedom of religion and speech. In particular, he notes that his religion of Rastafari and his &quot;belief that our herb/sacrament is good&quot; is oppressed. His statement ended with the slogans &quot;TAKE A TOKE, THEN VOTE&quot; and &quot;ENEMY OF THE STATE&quot; written in capital letters.

The Governor election was held on November 8, 2005. Of the ten candidates appearing on the ballot for Governor, Forchion came in sixth place with 8,271 votes, according to unofficial election results provided by the State of New Jersey. [ 9 ] The election was won by Democrat Jon Corzine .

 2006 United States Senate election, New Jersey [link] 

Forchion ran for US Senator from New Jersey in 2006. He was placed on the ballot with the same “Legalize Marijuana (G.R.I.P.)&quot; slogan. Forchion came in fourth place with 11,593 votes, or approximately 0.5% of the vote according to the official vote tallies. [ 10 ] Forchion finished behind Democratic incumbent Bob Menendez , Republican candidate Thomas Kean, Jr., and Libertarian Len Flynn, but ahead of five other candidates.

 2008 Congressional Campaign, New Jersey [link] 

Forchion announced that he would run for the 3rd Congressional seat in New Jersey being vacated by Jim Saxton . He will be running under the &quot;Legalize Marijuana (G.R.I.P.)&quot; Party, from California. He was the only independent running against Republican Chris Myers and Democrat John Adler . [ 11 ] The Burlington County Democratic Party challenged Forchion&apos;s petition and he was removed from the ballot due to insignificant number of valid signatures.

 2011 State Assembly Campaign, New Jersey [link] 

Forchion announced from California he would run for the state assembly seat in New Jersey. He will be running under the &quot;Legalize Marijuana Party, from California. Forchion received 1,476 votes but generated a lot of press because of his being admitted to the ballot because he resided in California, while New Jersey great Carl Lewis was kicked off the ballot for the same reason.

 Other elections [link] 

Forchion ran in 2005 for a Congressional seat from New Jersey, garnering 4,914 votes, approximately 1.6% of the vote. He lost to incumbent Jim Saxton , Republican. [ 12 ] In both 1998 and 2000, Forchion ran and lost against incumbent Congressman Rob Andrews , Democrat, receiving 1257 votes [ 13 ] and 1959 [ 14 ] votes, respectively. In his 1998 campaign, Forchion had not yet taken the moniker of NJWeedman, and instead ran as an independent simply as &quot;Rob.&quot;

Besides the above campaigns for Congress, Forchion also ran for New Jersey General Assembly . In 1999, Forchion received 947 votes and lost to incumbents Francis L. Bodine and Larry Chatzidakis, both Republicans.




 Incarceration history [link] 

Forchion was incarcerated in Camden, New Jersey for various drug related charges. The dates of his incarceration were between December 1, 2000 and April 3, 2002. Forchion’s offenses included the following: [ 15 ] 

 1 count/merged count of : 2C:5-2*2 Conspiracy 1 count/merged count of : 2C:35-5*2 CDS/Manufacture, Distribute, Dispense 1 count/merged count of : 2C:20-7*3 Receiving Stolen Property 1 count/merged count of : 2C:20-3*3 Theft by Unlawful Taking/Disposition 

According to his official statement [ 16 ] mailed with the sample ballots during his 2005 candidacy for New Jersey Governor, Forchion notes that “I’ve been jailed without the right to a fair trial (2000), imprisoned for simply saying LEGALIZE IT”. Forchion describes himself as a former political prisoner for his views. [ 17 ] 

Forchion was jailed from August 19. 2002 - Jan 24, 2003 by the State of New Jersey for attempting to air political ads calling for the end of the war on drugs. [ 17 ] He was charged with advocating criminal activity; Forchion claimed it was a violation of his first amendment rights and filed a writ of habeas corpus . U.S. District court Judge Irena&apos;s held hearings and agreed that his imprisonment was a violation of his right to freedom of speech and ordered him freed saying; &quot;Many elected public officials have called for a liberalization of the nation&apos;s drug laws. Simply put, Plaintiff&apos;s place in this debate will do nothing to harm a public that is already itself debating the current state of our nation&apos;s drug laws.&quot; Forchion was represented by New Jersey criminal defense attorney John Vincent Saykanic . [ 18 ]

The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.

1. Personal Information Collection and Use

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).

When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.

In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.

2. E-mail addresses

We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.

E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of
collection.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.

3. Third Party Advertisers

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information on cookies, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com.

4. Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
