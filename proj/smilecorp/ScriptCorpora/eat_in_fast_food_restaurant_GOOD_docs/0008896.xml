I went to the mega-McDonald&apos;s because it is next to the hotel my conference is being held.  I found it to be depressing on many levels. This review is going to be wholly negative, but keep in mind that I&apos;m only in a bad mood because this McDonald&apos;s has temporarily sucked away all of my happiness.

Some of the recent reviews mention how this McDonald&apos;s serves gourmet food like &quot;pasta and pizza.&quot; It makes me sad to see it described as &quot;gourmet.&quot;  It&apos;s the same sort of sadness you feel on Christmas Eve when you go to Walgreens and see a procrastinating parent buying a bunch of last-second, crappy Christmas presents.

A different reviewer mentioned how the &quot;workers are unenthusiastic.&quot; Of course they are. What is there to be enthusiastic about? They work at a giant and abnormally loud McDonald&apos;s. I actually appreciated their lack of enthusiasm. It helped me form a real human connection with them, and it gave me the feeling that we were in this thing together.

There are multiple videogames on the ground level and the upstairs level. It is just like Dave n Buster&apos;s only a) there is zero excitement b) nobody is smiling c) the customers are all big, slow, and have no peripheral vision, so you&apos;ll feel like young Marshall Faulk weaving through a crowd of linemen.

Having spewed all that negativity, let me say that this isn&apos;t the worst place in the world, and it is actually a great restaurant for those who enjoy being overcome with profound sadness. :-(

I roll through the drive thru at all hours of the day and night, so I can tell you how it&apos;s going to be at what times.  During the mornings, I like the old style of breakfast burritos which probably don&apos;t sell that well, however, I still would like them to be fresh  .  I normally get a hard tortilla that&apos;s been around for a while.  Also, late nights are hit or miss for food quality as well.  I don&apos;t mind waiting for fresh food at 1:00 in the morning.  Consistency is the name of the game in fast food.

I usually don&apos;t like posting bad reviews, but my recent experience was pretty rediculous.  If it wasn&apos;t for the big menu selection and the novelty value, I would have rated this 1 star. Why such a low rating?  I had extremely poor service from a manager (Stephanie) not honoring an active coupon from the local &quot;Enjoy Florida Magazine&quot; that was created for this specific location.  This place surely isn&apos;t the typical McDonald&apos;s.

This place is way better than the average Mc Donalds because ...... They serve gourmet food from pasta and pizza (plus their original) and also have an arcade! The interior is really fun because you feel like you just stepped into a whole different place. We sat by the jungle/pond looking area and went upstairs for all the fun. If I had this as a chid I would have wanted my birthday here.

This is like the Busch Gardens for a 4 year old. It&apos;s so cool here! It&apos;s a really cool experience even for a college student myself.

where do you take 7 hungry kids and 8 hungry kids on a budget?  the world&apos;s largest mcdonald&apos;s in florida!

we thought we were just stopping into a bigger than normal mickey dee&apos;s with a normal menu.  wrong!  on top of the regular menu, this place had a bistro section (pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, etc), ice cream section (serving shakes, big scoops of ice cream), and a 2nd floor full of games. (think chuck e. cheese meets mickey dee&apos;s meets baskin robbins meets an italian place).

there was definitely lots to do for the kids but finding a place to sit was tricky.  cleanliness wise, it was just OK.  the floors felt sticky and it was hard to find a clean table.  service wise, they seemed efficient but on one of our second trips to the register, the lady helping me seemed clueless about how to punch in an order for french fries.  random, right?

would still recommend checking this place out though.

Yes, I am giving McDonalds 5 stars. Why you ask? Well this is not your typical McDonalds. They serve other types of food. Pasta from Mcdonalds? It sounds nuts but its really good. Inside this place is like a theme park. Tons of arcades upstairs and some cool things on the bottom level. I like that this place is 24hrs.

::BATHROOM UPDATE::: This has to be the cleanest bathroom I&apos;ve seen at this type of place. The cool thing is that there is tons of mirrors inside the bathroom. It&apos;s really fun. They have this plastic thing that is on the toilet that you press and it disinfects every-time for people who actually sit on the toilet.

If you have kids I would highly recommend you bring them here. Also there is a spot where you sit on a bench and you can take photos w/ a fake Ronald McDonald.

This is one of the largest McDonalds in the world and they have a large selection of Gourmet food.

The breakfast here is far superior to standard McDonalds.

There is a huge game room inside and lots of games for kids.

I can&apos;t believe that I am reviewing a McDonald&apos;s but this place is just too cool not to mention.  I was attending a conference at a hotel down the street from this restaurant.  A friend and I were walking around trying to figure out what to do for lunch when we saw this McDonald&apos;s.  After we walked inside I realized that I had seen this place on TV.  It is kind of a madhouse and you can suffer from sensory overload.

There are lots of quirky things that make this McDonald&apos;s different than your father&apos;s Mickey D&apos;s.  The menu is vastly expanded including meatball sandwiches, Panini sandwiches, wraps, cheesesteaks, pizza, hand scoop ice cream and a whole lot more... I had a cheesesteak which was just okay.  Upstairs there are video games, an expanded kids playhouse, and the types of games where you can win tickets which are exchanged for prizes.  Downstairs you can get your hair braided, watch fishes swimming in huge tanks, listen to the animatronic moon dude playing the piano and play some games.  Even some of the seating is non-standard with fanciful tables and chairs.  Plus, the trash cans say &quot;thank you&quot; when you use them ;)

World&apos;s Biggest McDonald&apos;s! Game fl upstairs!
Went 1 yr ago.
I looked at the menu (on the side of restaurant) in shock&amp;amazement reading things like quesidillas, pasta, belgian waffles, peanut butter explosion cake...  And even display cases! Where the eff was I?!
I ordered tri-color tortellini(!) alfredo w garlic bread&amp;a wild berry smoothies (smoothies weren&apos;t MCD staple back then)!! They trew in shrimp for free! I didn&apos;t even know they HAD shrimp!

Hope it wasn&apos;t from The Gulf...

Tasted GREAT! If I am to be picky, slightly salty-tasting, BUT this is MCDONALDS, so I&apos;m sure it had much more bad stuff, incl sodium than I can imagine.

Most majestic bathrooms you&apos;ll ever see.
I passed some fat white lady on the way on the phone saying she told someone not to prostitute herself. Weird.

Only getting a 2nd star because the food from the bistro was good.

They completely messed up our order inside and in the drive thru.  Games at the arcade weren&apos;t fully fuctional.  They are also more expensive than a regular McDonald&apos;s.

I&apos;ll be back when visiting Orlando only because it is sort of a landmark, but service wise, you can skip this one if you want.

Uhhh.. for the world&apos;s biggest McDonalds, my expectations were definitely let down. It&apos;s simply a bistro (not sure if it&apos;s from mcdonalds or not), a mcdonalds, and a game area upstairs. Only food difference is the bistro, which is completely separate from the mcdonalds.

A few games on the first floor as well.. definitely very filthy place. Garbage cans say thank you and a crushing noise when you throw your trash in.. I was too amazed or anything.

You know the bovine growth hormones that they give cows to produce more milk? There was a genetic mutation of it which found it&apos;s way into this McDonald&apos;s and made it supersized. Yes, they let you know everywhere that this is the World&apos;s Largest Entertainment McDonalds.

Do you want a pizza? A &quot;gourmet sandwich&quot;? A &quot;gourmet burger&quot;? A panini? Spaghetti? Omelet? Belgian waffle? Yep...those are all here on a menu board which is the size of most McDonalds themselves.

Now that you have your order figured out, where do you sit? In one of the retro-style chairs? At a table where you can be serenaded by Mac Tonight on the piano? Upstairs?

This entire experience is sensory overload including the play area which occupies the majority of the second floor with their arcade games and McDonalds merchandise store.

I might have given them 4 stars because it does look cool from the outside. But I had to actually go inside. Twice. I&apos;m giving myself 5 stars for that feat of bravery and 3 to McDonalds.

I have to say this was probably one of the best parts of my vacation, sounds weird, I know! Until you actually experience this McDonald&apos;s you really can&apos;t judge, it&apos;s awesome! They have the regular mcdonald&apos;s side and the bistro cafe side. There&apos;s also an arcade and playplace upstairs. Each day they have an activity for guests which range from face painting to a reptile show. Yes, there was an alligator inside this place while I was eating!!

Me and my friend both ordered different items and split them. The food is surprisingly not bad. We tried a turkey wrap, ravioli, bistro burger, and philly cheesesteak.

There is a really cool machine where you can record your own songs, we did a duet and though we sounded horrible, it made for great laughs. I also played a game where you had to operate a claw that had a razor on it to cut the string of your prize. I won three of these and each prize was a stuffed animal, silly bands, and a generic Ipod that looked like the real thing.

If you&apos;re vacationing in Orlando this should definitely be on your list.

I was having one of those fabulously random nights with total strangers who quickly became friends.  We started out at Parliament House and then found ourselves several miles down I-4 at someone&apos;s hotel room for an after-hours party.  Several drinks later me and my crew were starting to wind down and needed some food to absorb all of the liquor we&apos;d consumed.

First, we found a cab.  Then, we saw those Golden Arches and I unintentionally found myself at the world&apos;s biggest McDonald&apos;s.  It reminded me of the dining options at Six Flags.  Clean enough to feel comfortable eating, but so many places to form a line that made it awkward.

I didn&apos;t see any of the crazy fish tanks that I had heard about (although, I wasn&apos;t looking).  I can appreciate anyone that serves me food at 4:30 AM and trusts me enough to enter the dining room instead of waiting in a never-ending drive-thru line.

OK, I never thought I&apos;d give any fast food place more than a few stars.  However, I needed to grab something quick for lunch, this place was close by and let&apos;s face it, who among us hasn&apos;t &quot;slummed it&quot; at least a few times in our lives and done the quick and nasty BK or Micky D&apos;s run when needing to grab something to fill you up in a hurry?

This McDonalds, however, was different than any other I&apos;ve ever been to.  Suffice it to say I never thought I&apos;d be &quot;impressed&quot; by a McDonalds until I saw this one.  Not only is it the worlds largest Entertainment McDonalds&amp;Playplace and was ranked #2 on the Travel Channel&apos;s list of most unique McDonalds, but the menu is what made this particular location stand out to me.

While they do have typical Micky D&apos;s fast food fare here, they also have a bistro gourmet menu that you won&apos;t find at just every McDonalds...Pizzas, wraps, gourmet sandwiches and paninis, a pasta station, etc. and everything there is made to order, it&apos;s not just pre-cooked burgers and greasy fries.  Prices are not out of line, either; I had the roasted turkey club meal with fries and a soda (served on proper plates..Not the usual styrofoam containers and boxes) and I paid under $8.

This is the biggest McDonalds in Orlando and it is pretty busy during the day with tourist but if you come in late at night it is pretty empty and you will get your food served pretty quick.&apos;

They are open 24 hours so when ever you are hungry you can stop by and get a bite.

They have two floors and in the second floor they have arcades and enough space to have private party&apos;s etc.   The food is fresh most of the time but like most place it depends on the time you come in.

This &apos;gourmet bistro mcdonalds&apos; may be fun for kids as it does have arcade games (guitar hero, airhockey, basketball shot etc), bowling lane (small one lane) and its own gift shop where you could redeem tickets for prizes... but to me it felt a bit run down.

Dining upstairs was not enjoyable with all the game sounds and lights flashing. It also seemed a bit odd as there was also two fish tanks and a ticket area where you could buy tickets to the theme parks (universal, disney, seaworld) a bit random.

Positives:
- truly a different...slightly bizarre dining experience. good for out of towners
- icecream station where they would prepare icecream mixes similar to how cold stone creamery mixes in toppings
- garbage cans that say thank you
- automatic toilet seat changer

Negatives:
- felt like a run down Chucky cheese
- random decor; needs a more united theme
- pastrami sandwich was better than expected but less tasty then a real deli sandwich

It&apos;s the world&apos;s largest McDonalds and they were totally right. It&apos;s humongous!! I didn&apos;t know where I was supposed to order at. They have a special bistro menu which includes eggs benedict and french toast I believe.

Upstairs is a huge arcade area for the kiddies. You could totally throw a birthday party there for a little kid. Think of it as Chuck e Cheese&apos;s but without the pizza and mouse. I think there is pizza though, but it&apos;s not from Mcdonald&apos;s. There are other vendors in there.

I didn&apos;t like this place very much because you can tell the people here do not care about their jobs very much. The people were talking amongst themselves while we were waiting. Obviously we wanted to order. Also, I asked to have no cheese on my breakfast sandwich and they couldn&apos;t even do that. It&apos;s not rocket science. I&apos;m also trying to save you money for telling you to keep your ingredients.

A great fun place for the whole family! This 24 hour World&apos;s Largest Entertainment McDonald&apos;s&amp;PlayPlace is definitely not your typical Golden Arches. This Micky D&apos;s has two levels including the restaurant/bistro and tourist info center on the first floor and PlayPlace, arcade games, and games with prizes on the second floor. Much love to the cool vintage Mac Tonight in the dining room! There&apos;s also a gift shop here which sells some cool McDonald&apos;s souvenirs and apparel. I would love to have my birthday party here if I was 5 yo again!

This McDonald&apos;s offers not only the typical core menu of Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, Filet O&apos; Fish, Egg McMuffins, etc., but also a Bistro Gourmet menu with breakfast (Belgian waffles, omelettes, French toast), gourmet sandwiches&amp;paninis, wraps, pizza, pasta dishes, taco salads, chimichangas, desserts (Blue Bunny ice cream, cookies, cakes, cheesecake), and more.

There are over 40 Extra Value Meals (Breakfast&amp;Lunch/Dinner) offered which include the core McD&apos;s meals (with fries/hash browns&amp;drink) and the Bistro Gourmet meals (offers choice of fries or side salad&amp;drink), under $10 each. You can order inside&amp;see the display case of actual bistro items or also use the drive-thru to order bistro items.  Check out the details, menu items, online coupons, and other Bistro theme locations at http://www.mcfun.com 

Since I went out on the town very late last weekend, I was getting hungry and stopped here around 2AM for the #30 Extra Value Meal Pastrami Sandwich with Side Salad&amp;Medium Diet Coke ($8.49). I was so &quot;McLovin&quot; it here!!! However, I didn&apos;t try to buy any booze with a Hawaii fake ID and ride around with the Police or go to any house parties like the McLovin character in &quot;Superbad&quot; who really cracks me up!!

LOCATION: Sand Lake Rd&amp;International Dr, right smack in the middle of tourist central!

This place has some major shock and awe factor being the world&apos;s largest McD&apos;s with playpen.

It&apos;s also a gourmet bistro, your order cooked when ordered.

Bfast for regular items (egg mcmuffin, big breakfast) end at 11.
Bfast for gourmet items (omelets, belgian waffles and the like) end at 10.

Ordered the ravoli w/ meatballs. Quite oversauced and too salty.

The 4 stars is definitely for its shock and awe and because you can only expect so much from a McD&apos;s....rate accordingly! :)

Prior to our visit to Orlando, my boyfriend and I were watching World&apos;s Best McDonald&apos;s on Travel Channel late one night. We&apos;re not big McDonald&apos;s fans, but it was interesting to watch. To our surprise, this one was named one of the best and it was located right next to where we would be staying. I was ecstatic, like a little kid in a candy store. I thought it would be so cool to visit a world renowned eatery. I made it a mission to visit this McDonald&apos;s. Who doesn&apos;t want to see a McDonald&apos;s shaped like a french fry box!?

Inside the actual restaurant, there is so much going on for kids. There was an arcade area, but it was closed while I was there. There were two seperate menus. One was filled with gourmet food that consisted of wraps, pasta dishes, deli types of meals. The other menu had the traditional burger, etc items that every McDonald&apos;s has to offer. Hershey&apos;s Ice Cream was served here, as well. The only downside was the prices were pretty steep for some fast food. It was my first time ever having a Big Mac and this was my first meal in Orlando -- a cheerful way/place to start out our vacation! :)

3 stars for the awesome decor, inside and out.

Went here 2 weeks ago for our annual DW vacation, but never went here before until this year.  This place is great for kids.  We came here twice to let our 3 year old blow off some steam in the play area, which is huge.  You could come here just to let your kid play for free and have a cheap happy meal.  I saw a lot of kids having a blast running up and down and through the tunnels, which were two stories high.

We never bothered playing the arcade games, which were a bit much, and we can always get a bargain at Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s.

We ate the normal fare, and not the bistro food, but I did get the banana splits, which were under $4.  We went twice and each time I got it.  So good with the whipped cream, bananas, and shaved almonds.  Freaking banana splits at Baskin Robbins in the D.C. area are $7.  Ate in front of the beautiful aquariums.

Can&apos;t go wrong with Mickey D&apos;s and a three year old.  We haven&apos;t been to a fancy restaurant since the kid was born.

Used to be the world&apos;s largest McD&apos;s!  Now they&apos;ve changed it to the world&apos;s most unique McD&apos;s.

They serve gourmet food!  We had the Pastrami sandwich and Fresco burger.  They were very good!

The dining area was very large.  There was an arcade inside and an upstairs gift shop.

Very unique McD&apos;s.  This place has tons of games, and it&apos;s own cafe with a completely different menu.  If you have smaller kids and are hoping for a nice play area, this particular McDs is not for you.  Unlike your typical Playland, customers *cannot* eat anywhere near the play area!  With that, you cannot let the kids blow off some steam right before lunch... and it&apos;s so busy, crazy, and loud, it is simply far from ideal for smaller kids who need closer supervision.

Now, older kids will love this place.  On another positive note, I did enjoy the McDonalds shrimp alfredo!

Ugh.

This place is billed as the worlds largest &apos;entertainment&apos; McDonalds.  Not sure what that means.  This is basically a normal sized McDonalds counter with a 2nd restaurant inside.  You order at one place and can pick from standard McDonalds items or something else from the bistro menu.  The McDonalds food is picked up in one area, the other food in another.  This other food is NOT McDonalds food, the gourmet burger I got from the bistro area was just OK.

They have a large play area on the first and second floor.  It is a mish mosh of everything, arcade games, tourist booths, hair braiding stations.  It all really did not go together.  What sums this up best is the Bill Cosby cutout leaning against a wall (picture attached).  He was popular in the 80&apos;s and hardly funny then.  Why they have him up in the McDonalds makes no sense.  I guess he fits in with everything else that is out of place.

Topping it off, the place was rather dirty.  I rarely eat at McD&apos;s, but if I had the craving in Orlando I would go elsewhere.

I&apos;m pretty much only rating this fast food restaurant b/c I thought it pretty cool that a McDonald&apos;s exists that serves something other than your typical McD&apos;s food. This place - you can get paninis, Belgian waffles, and even build your own pasta! AND it&apos;s open 24/7 for both the drive-thru AND dining area! Insane...  The wife and I stopped here after an exhausting day @ Magic Kingdom and kept it pretty simple (regular hamburger, fries), so I can&apos;t comment on the quality of the unique offerings. But if you&apos;re looking for some late-night variety in a familiar building, and don&apos;t feel like a Friday&apos;s, Perkins, or Denny&apos;s, this might be the option for you.

I freakin&apos; wish Alabama would pull this kinda thing and take a chance on doing something out of the ordinary. Orlando: 28 - Birmingham: 0

Okay, I admit it...as someone who tries to stay away from McDonald&apos;s whenever possible (except when I&apos;m out and about and get the craving for a shake or some fries), it feels a bit unusual to be reviewing a McDonald&apos;s, but this is no ordinary Mickey D&apos;s joint.  It just so happens to be the biggest McDonald&apos;s on the face of the earth.  Around 3am one night, some friends and I stopped by after leaving a screening of the Rocky Horror Picture Show at Universal City Walk, and we were amazed that this McDonald&apos;s, in addition to its standard menu offerings, served pasta, ice cream, gourmet cakes and pies, and then some!  More than what you&apos;d ever expect to find at the average McDonald&apos;s, right? Not only that, it&apos;s a bi-level building, complete with a downstairs seating area and an upstairs arcade/kid zone and birthday party areas on each floor!  For the first time in my life, despite the fact that it took quite some time for my friend to get her Happy Meal even though the other 2 of us received our orders before she did, I never thought I&apos;d say this, but I&apos;d come back!

Since this was a bistro, my son had the pasta and I had the cheesesteak. Had to come here after hearing this was the world&apos;s biggest mcdonalds. Food ok considering it is a mcdonalds. Game room upstairs and had a rustic feel downstairs. Glad I went for the experience.

&quot;Woohoo! As good as it gets!&quot; for a McDonalds.  Compared to others, this is probably the bets one I&apos;ve been to.  They have a full on arcade in the restaurant on both the first and second floors.  The play credits are cheap!  This also has a bistro section that you can order sandwiches and paninis from...

McDonalds food is always consistent.  Definitely try it out if you are in the area.  its a good time!

Victim of its own success...
Keeping it short as possible, I love the food/selection.  My daughter loves coming here and I can have a decent meal too.  The playland is the biggest one I have ever seen.  The video games are pricey and occasionally out of order...now for the expanded view...the people at the front are overwhelmed.  Many people don&apos;t know how to order using the crowd control system in place and frequently crowd the area that is being controlled.  This location could easily be twice the size and frankly it needs it.  McDonalds does try to keep order with plenty of employees in the front areas and with tiered registers.  Its just a popular location and undersized even being twice the size as most McDonalds.  Since it is such an exciting location for the kids its a complete madhouse.  I always get hammered with a full tray of food by kids running unescorted and my daughter frequently leaves with headaches because the music is so loud.  If its your first time or on vacation, stop by-the food on the expanded menu will help make your McDonalds visit a memorable experience.  Personally, I like the pasta bar and the pizza. If you are 5-6 trips in like I am, bring aspirin, patience and a time limit...

I am in Orlando with my daughter on vacation.  It was raining buckets outside.  We made a go at a Disney Park but it was just too wet. So, I looked around to find something fun and indoors for us to do.  i was so excited to find this McDonald&apos;s and give it a try.
I will say there is one great thing there and that&apos;s the play house.  The set up is nice where it&apos;s got one entrance so it&apos;s easy to make sure kids are safe inside.
My daughter and I were both excited about the gaming area as well, because she loves wining tickets and getting prizes.  Well, they are paperless there and you buy this credit card where you add money to buy games (no problem) but it is also supposed to culminate your total winnings on there to go and get prizes.  IT DID NOT!!  The worst part is my daughter won the jackpot on this one game where you hit the button and a ball drops down and lands in a hole with a point value.  she was sooooo excited to win the jackpot because she could get a bigger prize.  Plus she did pretty well on others too.  50 points here....25 there...
But when we went to gift shop our card only showed 200 points and not the jackpot. The guy looked at the card in the computer and saw there were several places where it just didn&apos;t accrue the wins.  He told me he would credit me back so she could re-play the games.  I was so mad!  I said that wouldn&apos;t work because the odds of her winning the jackpot again were pretty slim and asked him to add the points won to the card.  he said no, he couldn&apos;t do that.  Then he proceeded to tell me there was no manager after 4 pm.  (which is ridiculous)  Anyway my daughter was really bummed she ended up with a few sheets of stickers.
The other reasons I am marking this with low stars was that it&apos;s just so dirty.  Not the play area in general but the restaurant and bathrooms.  Of all the empty tables there was not one clean.  The staff is not friendly and it&apos;s set up so poorly for ordering and pick up it&apos;s just awful.
I say boooooooo to McDonald&apos;s for the underhanded way they get away with not giving people points on their cards.  I say booooooo for upsetting my daughter on her birthday vacation and I say get a mop and some cleaning supplies and by gosh if you work there please smile once in a while!!!!

This may be &quot;the world&apos;s best&quot; but the service is not. My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and it took us 30 minutes to get through the line, and then once we ordered, we got our fries and then had to wait a whopping FORTY FIVE minutes for the rest of our food. It was infuriating to say the least, but luckily we got a full refund after complaining to the manager.

This place has a huge playplace, and some pretty awesome videogames, but if you are coming here for the food, be prepared to wait and complain, at least if you go on a Sunday.

So what makes a McDonalds the largest in the world? Two separate ordering counters, a giant dining room, a huge play area upstairs, and a video arcade full of fun redemption value type games.

I&apos;d never been to this location until we had our son&apos;s birthday party there today. The crew assigned to make my son&apos;s day special was on the ball and right there with anything we might need.

Food choices were great. Better than you&apos;d expect from a McDonalds. After the party they gave us cards pre-loaded with tokens and we got to explore the game area upstairs.

I would totally recommend this location as a birthday spot over that other place with the pizza and the mouse.
