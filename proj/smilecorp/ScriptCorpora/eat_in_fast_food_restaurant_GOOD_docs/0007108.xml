The next generation cordless telephones will require multiple base stations to implement the&quot;micro&quot;cellular approach. Fast food restaurants will become a logical terminal point for these systems. The implementation of a totally ubiquitous telephone communications system requires the installatibn of base station units in the field by a service provider. The present approach would require the service provider to lease sites from common entities such as fast food chains. The prevalence of fast food chains makes them an excellent choice for site locations. If the telepoint could provide a value added enhancement to the fast food industry, this would allow: - The service provider to minimize leasing cost @erhaps even charge for the service). - Increase acceptance of the product concept. - Speed the implementation of the system.
