 You May Need To Apply For a Fictitious Business Name Regisration 



Starting your own Fast Food Restaurant 
 businesses using a company name in Anoka County need to get a(n) DBA Doing Business As Trade Name Registration. For example, your are a home based business doing busines as your website domain name &quot;www.AA
 Fast Food Restaurant
 Merchant. com &quot;. The domain name must be registered as a DBA Doing Business As Name or if you are using another trade name that one you will need to file as well.. 
 

If you are thinking of hiring help, you will need a state employer ID and an IRS number employer ID. 
 I.e., a MN Federal Tax Id Number and a(n) MN State Employer Tax Number Note that there are two state tax IDs: a state employer tax ID (EIN) and a sales tax ID ( seller&apos;s permit).
 
 
Instead of filing a fictitious business name DBA Filing in 
 Minneapolis, Incorporate in MN or form a(n) MN LLC 
Most likely, you will need to file a trade name certificate. If you incorporate or form an LLC, you don&apos;t need to get a trade name unless the LLC or Corporation Name is different from the trade name. So, for example, your LLC is called &quot;XYZ&quot; LLC but you do business as &quot;Electronics Discount Haven&quot;. You will need to file a fictitious business name under the LLC for that DBA name. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Instead of filing a Anoka County fictitious business name (our service fee includes dba business name filing and legal paper publication) you can elect to incorporate in 
 Minnesota or form an MN LLC (starts @ $199 for most states&amp;includes bylaws and LLC operating agreement).. 

 
 If you do form an Home-Based Business llc or incorporate your Fast Food Restaurant business instead of just filing a fictitious business name (dba), 
 it will help you avoid legal and financial personal liability arising out of business transactions and you will not have to register the Minneapolis business name.
If you employ workers, you will need a federal EIN and a State EIN tax ID number.
 Note that there are 3 tax ID numbers: A federal tax ID number, a state employer tax ID number and a 
 sales tax ID number ( seller&apos;s permit).

Partnerships, corporations and llcs are required to get a federal tax Id number in addition to other tax ids above. Click on the tabs ( 1,2,3,4,and 5, above ) for more information

 Description 
 Starting a restaurant business is perhaps a good idea because most people today want to eat out or take food home.  Even though we have about 1,000,000 food service establishments as of 2012, there may still be some opportunity out there.
Most consumers want to have a fast and tasty meal, quickly.  That makes the to go food industry more attractive but some say, even despite  that, the restaurant business is not the easiest to make a lot of money.
If you can provide real good food and service coupled with great people to serve it, as well as a good a simple operation, you may have a good chance of succeeding in this business.  However, if you don’t know about serving or cooking food, a restaurant may not be for you.
But who your clients are going to be?  
Those from 15 to 25 year old eat out and usually they eat to go or fast foods.  So a fast food restaurant may be a good idea to target them.  The 25 to 45 crowd likes a more gourmet but yet fast type of service.  So a regular, not so formal restaurant may be ok If you want to cater to this group.  To serve the crowd from 45 and above, you may want to have an upscale restaurant and or a family upscale restaurant.    
Finally, keep everything clean, smelling well and elegant and you may be able to make some money operating a restaurant.
