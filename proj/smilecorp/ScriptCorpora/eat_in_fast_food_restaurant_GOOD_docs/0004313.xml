Masala Zone?  Are you kidding me?  I&apos;m not going to eat at somewhere named Masala Zone, that sounds terrible.

Wrong.  This place is the tasty-ness.  If you didn&apos;t eat here because of the name then you just fucked up.  oops.

Lets talk for a minute about why MZ is the hotness.
1.  If you have to eat out alone a lot (obvious I eat out alone, look at this review, you think I have friends?) they have a huge bar thats perfect for eating some lone tasties and not feeling like as much of a weirdo. They also are good about not keeping you waiting if you are on your own.  nice.
2.  If you are jetlagged and eating at odd hours they have super cheap deals. Get on that.
3.  You can do your laundry next door while you eat.  Look how efficient you are.
4.  Thalis mean you don&apos;t really have to make up your mind, Just order big and eat all kinds of goodness.
5.  The desserts look delicious but I&apos;m always so full I&apos;ve never been able to try them.
6.  Way cheaper and way better service than Chor Bizarre.  Whack ass Chor Bizzare, get that shit out of my face.

Whatever, lists are weaksauce, I&apos;m sorry for even doing that.  I eat here all the time.  ALONE.  Come on, if that isn&apos;t going to persuade you to eat here then stop reading yelp, you are beyond helping.

Masala Zone was a recommendation from our hotel Concierge and a nice walking distance from where we were staying in London.

We were seated right away on a busy Saturday night. Service was excellent.  The waitress explained the menu to us and took our drink orders immediately.

The decor is modern and cozy. Soft lighting throughout the restaurant but still very upbeat with a combination of large party groups and tables for two.

We each ordered the Grand Thali, thanks to our gluttonous behaviour!
The Grand Thali consists of a canapé, papadum and chutney, a choice of curry, two vegetables, dal (lentil), raita (yoghurt), salad, chapati (indian bread)&amp;rice. It sounds like a lot of food, but each of the dishes come out in mini bowls so you get to try a bit of everything. Price was 10-12GBP each.

Also on the menu is a good selection of starters; cold and hot, as well as &apos;street food&apos; appetizers. We wanted to try some; however, resisted since our eyes are always bigger than our stomach.

Very satisfied with this meal, as it was the end of our Europe trip.

I dined with two friends (26 October 2011) at Masala Zone in Soho. We had early dinner reservations (6pm), as we flew in that morning from the USA and Canada. The place is quite lively and filled up quickly. The acoustics was pretty bad, but we still had a very nice time together.

My friend Lee selected Masala Zone for its Thali, which we all ordered. Thali is a medley of different dishes served on large platters. I selected the butter chicken for my meat course (you can choose chicken, lamb, shrimp, etc), which came with curry vegetables, lentils, raita, chapatis (whole wheat bread), and rice, all for about £11.50. Everything was scrumptious and the chicken tender!

While this is a chain restaurant, I thought the food was well prepared (the flavors of each dish blended well), and reasonably priced, especially in expensive London. I would definitely return here the next time I&apos;m in London. I&apos;ll have to search out for a similar type of place where I live.

BEST Indian food I&apos;ve tried (but i&apos;ve only tried LA Indian food). Luckily, Yelp has extended it&apos;s reach to the UK, otherwise I would&apos;ve never found this place. The staff was extremely kind and helpful with our dining choices.
It has been a month since I ate here but I STILL remember the name of the dishes I tried --

The Grand Thali came with plenty of food (your choice of curry and different kinds of side dishes that were great for dipping your bread). If there&apos;s one thing you MUST try it&apos;s the DAHI PURI. No need for explanation just get it. You won&apos;t be disappointed. :)

I come here a lot.

I mean, a LOT.

Mainly because of a promotion that gets me half price food to be honest. This makes their thalis a great lunch treat if I&apos;m feeling like a chilled lunch. The grand thali is a fantastic beast comprised of a curry of your choice alongside several vegetable side dishes; always different, always a delight. Round it off with some rice, chutneys and a chapatti and you have yourself a meal. I&apos;m that weird kind of person who doesn&apos;t mind taking a gamble on menus so this sort of pot-luck approach to the thali is awesome and encourages repeat visits.

Quality of the food is good. The meat is cooked decently, never dry, and the curries have a great combination of flavours. The fact that the majority of your meal is in fact vegetarian and still fantastically tasty is testament to the chefs here (yeah, I&apos;ll say it, a lot of vegetarian food is bland and pointless)

At full price the dish is decent value; at half price I&apos;m planning my return trip on the way out of the door.

Oh, one word of warning. Don&apos;t order the masala cola. Grim.

Very tasty food. I am very very partial to the Thali, especially the Managalore chicken curry. The regular thali was a bit much for me, in terms of portion size. I had trouble finish it up but forced my self anyway.Something to keep in mind, for next time, I should skip lunch if I am heading out here for dinner.
My husband had the butter chicken with naan and a chicken biryani. The portions were huge and he was able to finish it up quite easily.
Service is very good. I was quite surprised how attentive the waiters were.Always had our glasses of water topped up.
One of the few good Indian restaurants in the Covent Garden area. Good find, definitely going back.

This place is a favorite of mine, and offers amazing Indian fusion food for the price.

It is located on a street that isn&apos;t as busy with stupid tourists and frenzied shoppers, which is nice if you are a calm person like myself.

The service at Masala Zone is top-drawer all the way, and the servers are very good and personable.

The menus offers a great deal of choices, and it is a good place for vegetarians too.

Does exactly what it says on the tin. There are plenty of these all over London but this was always my regular; another one of these default places you go to when you can&apos;t think of anywhere else to go. Excellent food at value for money pricing. friendly attentive and rapid staff make this place great. Can be pretty boisterous and busy at times but hey this is Soho.

Wow, this place was good.

I think I got the Thali (regular not grande) with butter chicken for about 8 GBP - I believe? The quantity was not too large, but the quality was definitely good. Actually, it&apos;s probably better that the quantity was average because you would get full. Unless you have a really large appetite, just get the regular thali.

The thali came with a potato salad type dish (which was excellent), green mint/coriander dish, and I can&apos;t recall. Either way, I enjoyed it and would definitely go back again.

Apparently, the owner is supposed to be similar to Tayyabs, which is another good Indian joint. (Don&apos;t take me for my word...this is what I heard from another person who lives here.) I have been to Tayyabs, and the wait is RIDICULOUS.

Masala Zone is quite nice. Not loud. Nice ambiance. Good food. Would go back again. =)

This review is for the desi who&apos;s sick of eating bland Indian food that caters to the western palate.

Let me begin with saying that the &apos;chaat&apos; was perfect! We tried the sampler plate&amp;they were all good. The chaat may not be as grand as that which you get in Delhi or Mumbai but it comes darn close.

For mains we ordered the regular &apos;thali&apos; and there wasn&apos;t one thing in there that we could complain about. The thali was fairly spicy, though (both my husband&amp;I had to blow our noses once through the meal). The portions are large, so we were stuffed&amp;didn&apos;t try the desserts.

The service was friendly&amp;quick (we went after peak time&amp;the restaurant wasn&apos;t full). We had 2 different restaurant staff walk over&amp;ask if everything was OK.
The bathroom area door is deeply recessed&amp;you don&apos;t get to see the insides of it each time someone opens it (yay!)
The &quot;show&quot; kitchen is visible from the dining area but it&apos;s pleasant to watch the activity in there. There main kitchen is behind recessed double doors&amp;not visible. I liked the understated decor here (Warli murals on the walls) no Maharajas in gilded frames. The place is well lit.

It is handicap accessible (call ahead for assistance).

I have seen a number of reviews deriding this as merely a &apos;chain&apos; as if that immediately detracts from its capability to deliver tasty robust and reasonably genuine Indian food. However when that chain has the parentage of the much respected Veeraswamy and Chutney Mary restauarants you tend to ignore that. Indeed as a &apos;chain&apos; it has grown considerably but the quality of the food has not changed since there were one or two of them.

Thankfully I have at least a good enough comparison of food having been to India and living in an area where there is a large Indian community and award winning restaurants. So I can say that this is very well done and very well presented food. The spicing is as it should be and pungently aromatic at times. Well priced for the West End and with friendly and efficient service, this is a favourite of mine.

It can easily cater for couples or groups as they have tables of varying sizes. The menu caters for what they call &apos;street food&apos; and is presented really as a fast food Indian experience. But that would be doing it down as these dishes are well worth savouring.

It&apos;s not a restaurant to bring a romantic date nor is it one where the wine list will leave you breathless but for excellent and extremely tasty Indian food, well presented and efficiently served, you can&apos;t go wrong.

I&apos;ve been to masala zone several times now and I still haven&apos;t decided whether it is good or not.  However, since I only ever come here about once every year and it is pretty low on my list of places to go for an indian, I think honestly, the verdict is leaning towards &quot;no, I don&apos;t particularly like it&quot;.

My friend and I arrived at peak hour- just after 8 and were asked to wait for a few minutes to be seated- however, during the 10 minutes we waited, there was a table close to the door that was free, and lo and behold! that was our table.  I guess this was to be expected as all the staff seemed very busy and in my personal opinion, the restaurant could have benefited from at least 1 if not 2 more servers this evening.  I was impressed that the staff were calm and friendly after running around in frenzy, although they did forget our extra order of poppadoms and had to be prompted for them.

We both had the butter chicken thali and the chicken was good, spices were well balanced.  The chapati was a large round pita/ naan without substance rather than a traditional chapati, so I was a little disappointed as I expected well, a chapati.  Personal bugbear of highly spiced poppadom was here and the daal tasted like Chinese red bean (aduki bean) soup without the sugar, underspiced and under salted (total failure in my point of view).  Aloo gobi was ok and the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced.  Actually I take that back; the poppadom was so over spiced, I believed the non-descript veggie curry was over spiced- I am not entirely sure on that one.

I really like the idea of a fast food type thali restaurant serving good quality Indian food at reasonable prices.  However, I also believe that good indian food is delicately spiced- i.e. bursting with flavor; you can taste all the spices but not all screaming bloody murder in your mouth at the same time, then replaced by a bland hotness.  Masala zone comes in a little heavy handed with their spices, and that is just not the kind of indian that makes me food happy...  I want to taste be able to taste all the different dishes, I don&apos;t want to just slop different types of goop in my mouth.

All in all, I probably won&apos;t come back for at least another year, and by that time I would probably have forgotten what made me upset about the Masala Zone.  It is a lot of food for the money they charge though.

At least I have tayyabs to look forward to tomorrow!  Yum.

Fun stuff.
A place like Masala Zone could only exist in a densely-packed and highly concentrated Indian enclave like London, New York, or possibly San Jose.

Naysayers will snub Masala Zone and call it a chain restaurant, but it&apos;s really quite nice and their concept is sound.  That and the fact that their food is quite good.

Their focus is thalis, and in my mind, this really is the best way to serve Indian food if you&apos;re not into the &quot;all you can eat buffet&quot; kind of thing.  A thali is pretty much a complete meal served on a large steel platter.  The rice is in the center and it is surrounded by small bowls (katoris) of condiments, side dishes, and whatever the kitchen was in the mood for making that day.
The ordering process is a little confusing at first, but easily understandable:

Step 1: Decide on which thali you want, regular or grand.
Step 2: Decide on your main protein or veg (e.g. chicken, prawn, veggie, etc.)
Step 3: Decide on the style of your main protein or veg (e.g. curry, tikka masala, butter chicken, etc.)
Step 4: Wait for your platter and chow down.

Thalis come in regular or grand, and they&apos;re a pretty good deal ranging from 9-12 pounds for a complete meal.

Papadum are so thin, you can almost see through them.  Chapatis are whole wheat and have a nice texture too.

Staff are friendly and eager to guide you through the maze of choices on their menu.

Atmosphere and decor is hip and casual.

Complain all you want about the chain restaurant thang, but I&apos;d kill for a masala zone here in the States.

Not a HUGE fan of Indian food, but  this place gets a 3 star rating. They&apos;re decently priced, always a plus when the food tastes decent too.

When in London, I usually end up eating here at some point during my stay. Again, not into Indian food, but this place makes the cut.

Its not good when you have it delivered, so be sure to visit a location.

If I were you, I would order:
the grand thali with veges or prawns (the prawns are not good in Indian food from what I&apos;ve been having...they&apos;re just way too small&amp;unfulfilling)

This grand thali comes served on a huge round silver tray with little silver bowls of a crazy variety of spices, herbs, sauces, salads, veges, indian bread, rice, and lentils.

I&apos;ve never had Indian food served like this until this place, so it was unique. The whole layout of this particular place is pretty nice, simple, oak/wood decor, bar like seating in some areas, not usually crowded.

I don&apos;t know if there is a specific way, or a specific order to eat everything on these trays, but I just graze about, trying all the different colored&amp;textured randomness. Works for me every time.

I don&apos;t like the yoghurt they serve with the entrees, nor do I like their special herb sodas, SOO GROSSS. Don&apos;t do it, don&apos;t.

This place is better than any other Indian place I&apos;ve tried. I really don&apos;t like buffet styled restaurants, and most of the Indian places I&apos;ve been to are, so good on ya Masala Zone for taking the road less traveled.

Everytime I&apos;ve passed through Carnaby Street/Soho I&apos;ve always found myself saying I must try Masala Zone and now I finally have!

Being located in a busy area the restaurant is simply but elegantly decorated like a canteen styled eatery. Menu is easy to read and the staff are very helpful explaining what everything is. I love food and I love curry, so I instantly went for a grand thali which is basically enough to count or a starter and main course. There wasn&apos;t a long wait till our huge platters arrived. I was a bit anti-social as I was concentrating so hard as I didn&apos;t know where to start with all the little bowls of delicious things. I accompanied my food with a yummy mango lassi which in hindsight I should have ordered for desert.

We had a voucher for 2-4-1 mains but there were 4 of us the and waiter kindly re-printed another voucher for us making the evening even more sweeter! However everything is very reasonable anyway considering the quality and quantity of food.

A big must for a quick fix curry or for a group occasion.

The Masala Zone chain is a favorite in general for reliably good Indian food, but this location seems to be the best of the bunch.

It&apos;s located on a quiet street behind the bustle of Regent and Carnaby Streets, and is a welcome respite from the flotillas of stressed-out holiday shoppers.

I almost always go for the chicken tikka kabob, which changes flavors on a daily basis so we can be surprised when it arrives.  And the garlic baby spinach dish from the side order menu is a must have which we always share no matter what else we order.

Don&apos;t let the fact it&apos;s a casual dining chain keep you away - Masala Zone is under the same ownership as the fantastic and upscale Veeraswamy on Regent Street (which you must treat yourself to at least once in this lifetime).

Masala Zone is a chain of Indian restaurants serving mainly thalis - combination of different dishes on one plate. I like dining here when I come to London on my own as it&apos;s relatively cheap to get a complete meal for one person with starter, main course, rice, naan and condiments without breaking the bank.

There is a lot of flexibility as to what you want on your thali plate as well as how many curries etc, with price obviously increasing with the number of items you choose. There is also a nice section of starters, which can be ordered separately.

For me, the food is competent and the portions are generous but the flavour is average. Perhaps I&apos;m spoiled by having the curry houses of Tooting so close to home. However, I do still return here when I&apos;m in town and fancy a curry for one.

I like Masala Zone for 3 reasons:

-Thalis (I love everything that comes with more than 3 different kind of food on it)
-Gol guppa or &quot;pani puris&quot;
-Indian street food without having to spend 3 days in ICU after it (I will review the indian healthcare in YELP Bombay as soon as someone creates it, I promise...)

Thumbs up, Masala Zone!

Lets say you were dating someone that was British-born Indian and you had never really had curry before and you asked them to bring you somewhere legit for your first curry experience.  Would you expect to be brought to a chain restaurant?

Let&apos;s just say I was mildly furious at the lack of effort.

Let&apos;s also acknowledge that the term &apos;mildly&apos; is an understatement.

So I have to say the only curry I had before this was on a flight on Air India on which I was weighing the probability of statistical outcome on which would kill me first:  the shotty plane, the pilot that seemed to like to create turbulance where it probably didn&apos;t exist, or the botched airline food that came in containers, none of which I could identify other than the one that said &quot;water&quot;...

So this being my first &quot;curry&quot; and living in the land of &quot;curry or go home&quot; I expected to prepare and deliver some speech on how &quot;oh gosh, this is what I&apos;ve been missing, I feel so cultured&quot;  but instead I recited, &quot;hmm ok... well, thanks for ordering for me.&quot;

Maybe Indian food isn&apos;t for me, it was ok, I&apos;ve since walked by what seems like zillions of Masala Zones and have yet to be tempted to go back in.  As my date pointed out, there were other Indian people eating there and that was a good indication, so apparently it&apos;s somewhere close to legit.

I&apos;ve been taken to two other places since then, one was supposed to be the top top top amazing and one was apparently supposed to be &quot;pretty good&apos; for Brick lane standards, and they all tasted and looked the same to me but had different price tags.  I say this with the caveat that I&apos;m apparently not a curry-person, but if someone is making me go get one with them, I&apos;d rather just go to Brick lane.

I really liked this place. Perhaps the best Indian I&apos;ve had in awhile. The thali was a good size and I felt satisfied without being over stuffed. The flavors were really great and you get a little taste of everything. Solid choice in London.

This is one of my must-do&apos;s everytime I visit London and is often my first real meal after getting off a flight.

Anyone that is with me has to experience it and I have yet to have someone who was disappointed by the experience.

The Thalis are definitely the way to go.  They offer quite a variety and for someone who loves to have multiple options during a meal they are great.

Been to this Masala Zone several times now and still think its great. Their food is delicious, if not incredible. Most importantly,  its different from the standard curry house - in a good way!

They have plenty of room but you should expect to wait a little while on busy nights as they&apos;re very popular.

Food wise the thali is my favourite, you get a range of starter dishes and your own choice of main course but they also do a great line in tandoori. As if that wasn&apos;t enough the cocktails are delicious!

There are a couple of negatives... I&apos;d say that its a little impersonal and sometimes rushed. The menu is also not very extensive, you&apos;ll quickly find yourself returning to the same old thing.

On the whole its well worth a visit, there are some great dishes and a great night to be had!

I typically start with one of their delicious Mango lassis and then jump straight into either a Grand Thali or Regular Thali plate depending on whether I am going to share. The Thali plates come with a bunch of little bowls filled with dal, various vegetables, yogurt, and other things that are great for dipping. You also get to choose a curry. I can personally vouch for the butter chicken, chicken mangalore, and the other spicy green chicken curry.

The prices are already pretty reasonable, but if you want to have a very reasonably priced meal and there are two of you, try splitting a Grand Thali and throwing in an extra nan. You can also throw in an extra side bowl of curry. Even with the lassis the two of you can probably escape for just around 20 GBP.

I think the only area that Masala Zone could significantly improve on is their nan. It lacks the freshness and fluffyness of excellent nan.

Cheers

Even though its a chain restaurant its really good, Grand Thali was awesome and served the way its supposed to be (stainless steel plates). Very filling and satisfying. Only thing the drink prices are too expensive and desserts even more.

One of the best things about being in London is experiencing the Indian food! So it&apos;s ideal not to be disappointed when your food arrives. Masala Zone packs in an explosion of old world tastes into a new world setting.

One of the first things you&apos;ll learn when you enter the restaurant and talk to your waiter is that masala means spice. Here you&apos;ll find &quot;street dishes&quot; that are fit for royalty! Be sure to try the pan bhaji- yum!

Ok, so it&apos;s not the most authentic in the entire world, but it&apos;s pretty good value, especially for the veg thali.

Service better than average.  Usually easy for a walk in after the theatre.  Recommended.

for a chain, this is pretty good.  we shared the veg thali (not the grand thali, just the regular one), chana dabalroti, and the dahi puri.  i loved the dahi puri.  the chana dabalroti had more bread than i expected, and i was hoping for more lotus root.  the thali was great, and i liked that we were able to pick the curry we wanted.  it came w/ 2 chapatis, so it was plenty of food for 2 of us.  to drink, i had a mango bellini.  yum!

masala zone.
i love you.

its funny. since ive moved here, about once a week i crave Indian food. some might argue that Masala Zone isnt that great, but for what it is, its pretty fantastic. its reliable, its fast, it tastes amazing. any questions?

it serves until 11, so my friends and i often meet here before a night out. only once has the service been bad - and that time it was a nightmare - but the management took care of part of our bill with out us even saying anything, just reading the looks of horror on our faces. and hey, ive been back again, so...

and their toilets are labeled &quot;Toilet Zone.&quot; if thats not hilarious, i dont know what is....

One of the things we wanted to try when we visited the UK was Indian food.  Masala Zone did not disappoint!  It was some of the best food we had on our European vacay.  Everything on our thali plate was delectable!  It was a great dining experience and a nice way to end our trip.

This place has become like my second kitchen. I eat from here nearly everyday! You think I&apos;m joking but I&apos;m not. It helps that I live right next door but that isn&apos;t the only reason why I keep coming back. I love fresh food with flavor at bargain prices and that is exactly what I get here! How do I know it&apos;s fresh? Well, I see the delivery truck loaded with fresh fruit and veg everyday! Furthermore, I can smell the delish aromas of real Indian cooking creeping through the crevices of my windows and doors everyday!

Typically my partner and I will order the regular sized thalis. The thali is basically like a set meal which comes with  sides of veg, potato, and lentils of the day, along with two sauces to eat with your popadoms, and then of course the main which is normally rice with whatever curry you choose. I usually go for the Prawn Malai. To me this curry is a perfect blend of creamy coconut milk based sauce with a barely there spice.
My partner likes to get the Lamb Korma. I am a pescatarian so I cant personally comment on this curry, but I take it from the numerous people that have tried this dish that it is pretty damn good.
There isn&apos;t really any difference between the regular and large thali as you aren&apos;t getting larger portions with the latter. In fact, the extra bit is some naan bread, little salad, and small samosa. Regular thalis are about £6-7. I definitely recommend this set as you&apos;ll get to taste a little of everything without spending more.

Dining in is also a nice option since staff are very congenial! The place itself is not posh but more casual. The look they&apos;re going for is maybe an underground clay like hut but creative and Indian inspired nonetheless.
Compare this place to all the little restaurants on Brick Lane and Masala Zone would still come out on top for me. Only reason why this place didn&apos;t receive 5 stars is out of homage to my Indian friend&apos;s mum&apos;s cooking, who by far is the best at Indian cooking ever!

This place is convenient and ubiquitous and it definitely fixing any instant curry cravings -- but honestly - the food you get here is not much better than something you get at a corner store in south hall -- beggar&apos;s can&apos;t be choosers in some parts of central london -- so this place is passable for indian food - its really sad thought - because the concept is really great -- and i think they even served on thalis at one point - but the whole things is easier on the eyes than it is on the stomach -- don&apos;t get me wrong - its not bad! But if you have the time and the energy to go get some real Indian food  - then this wouldn&apos;t be your first stop!

It was one unfortunate evening when the restaurant we had planned to go for dinner was not what we expected, and without a table reservation we ended up wandering along the streets of Soho with no luck of finding a restaurant with table  for six persons. Masala Zone was the only one welcoming us, and hungry and thirsty we were just glad to get into a any place.

The impression I got from the restaurant is that they offer fast food with Indian influence. My dish was actually very extraordinary mix of potato and banana (yes!) in a curry sauce and not bad at all. Creative at least! My friends experiences varied, but overall the food was ok. It was the service that gave us the empty feeling.

The waitresses were really fast, and little too effective, and gave us this in-and-out fast food restaurant feeling. You know as soon as you lie your fork and knife on the empty plate, it vanishes! We felt like we were pushed out as by that time there was already queue to this restaurant as well but that just left us a bit disappointed by the experience.

I am not an Indian food expert (although I eat it quite a bit in the US).  I had reservations about this being a chain, but the food was - my butter chicken (aka tikka masala, aka whatever) was good, and the accompanying side dishes in the Thalis were good.

Nice restaurant deco....except the day I visited the air-con wasn&apos;t working and it was extrememly hot.  I had the lam and the mint apple juice.  I love the apple juice.  The food was decent and has a nice selection of sides.  This places emphasis is on vegetables.  Decent food but average for Indian food.

Its a good place to catch a quick meal. Decent food, decent prices.  Nothing mindblowingly tasty.  Ambience: meh.  I wouldnt go there if I specifically wanted to have Indian food .  I&apos;d go there if I was hungry on the road and this was right in front of me.
