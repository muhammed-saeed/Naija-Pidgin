 Mr. Charlie 
 Mr. Charlie is a family recipe my parents made for me when I was little. Now, I make it for my boyfriend, and he loves it. He wanted to know where the recipe came from. He even asked Yahoo answers. He got an answer back. A person said that it came out of an old Navy cookbook.  That would make since, since my dad had been in the Navy.
When I make mine, I kind of do it a cheating way. The real way involves buying plain elbow pasta. I start with a box of cheap macaroni and cheese. I would call this a one pot meal, but it really takes two.
Ingredients:
1lbs Ground Beef
1 Medium to Large Onion, Chopped
1 Can Tomato Soup
2 Cups Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese
1 Box Macaroni and Cheese
1/2 Cup Milk
1 Can Diced Tomatoes
1 Can Mushrooms
Salt and Pepper to Taste
  Most of the Ingredients I forgot the tomatoes. Also not pictured: 1/2 Cup of Milk Start by browning the ground beef and chopped onion in a 2 to 4 qt pot. While that is cooking, in another pan, start boiling the elbow pasta as instructed on the box of Mac &apos;n Cheese. After the beef is cooked, drain the grease off.   Ingredients before Pasta is Added I then, start adding all of the other ingredients into the pan with the beef. I drain the mushrooms and add those. Then, I add the can of tomatoes without draining them. I dump the cheese powder from the box of Mac &apos;n Cheese into the pan. I add about a 1 and a 1/2 of the shredded cheese to the pan. I put in the can of tomato soup in. I then pour the 1/2 cup of milk into the soup can to rinse out the left over soup. I pour that into the pot, then. After that, I add a very small amount of salt and a very large amount of ground pepper. I like pepper!      Drained Elbow Pasta When the pasta is done, I drain it. I then add it to the pot of ingredients. This is when I start tasting. I usually add more shredded cheese at this point. You can use any cheese you like, but I like the shredded sharp cheddar or Colby. I let the cheese and other ingredients simmer for about ten minutes.   Mr. Charlie This dish is very flexible! You can add Italian seasoning to it and go one way, or add Chili Powder to it and make it a Tex Mex Dish. You could also change the can of tomatoes to a can of Rotel Tomatoes and Chilis to go in the Tex Mex direction.  Mr. Charlie with a Roll This is an easy meal that can be made to your taste. You can serve it with tortilla chips or with a roll. This is also a little piece of my family&apos;s history! Enjoy!

 Mexican Pizza: Homemade 
 This may be a trade secret, but when you work at a restaurant, a lot of food experimenting goes on in the kitchen. When I worked at Arni&apos;s in Lafayette, after hours, if we were really nice, we could ask the cooks at the Pizza Counter to make us a Mexican Pizza! I started thinking about this last week and decided, I should try to make one at home!
Ingredients:
1 Lb. of Taco Meat (I&apos;m using ground beef. You could probably use Fajita Chicken or Steak.)
1 8oz. Bag Shredded Mexican Cheese
1 8oz. Bag Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
1/2 Sliced Large Onion
2-3 Sliced and/or Diced Roma Tomatoes
1 Can Pillsbury Pizza Crust (I used the 11oz. Thin Crust.)
1/2-1 16oz Jar Picante Sauce
3-4 Cloves Garlic
3-4 Tbl. Spoons Olive Oil
*Preheat the oven according to the instructions on the can. The one I had said 400 degrees.
 Picante Sauce and Toppings I used the Crust Trick I blogged about previously. (This is when you use the garlic cloves and the olive oil.) Then, I baked the crust for about 7 minutes. I took it out and started adding my ingredients. First, I put on the Picante Sauce. I used about half the jar. If you want it saucier, go ahead and use more. Then, I put on the taco meat I had made for tacos earlier in the week. I used a little more than a half a pound. After that, I put on the tomatoes and onions. The cheese comes next! I love cheese! I put on the entire package of Mexican cheese. Than, I used the entire package of Mozzarella.   Super Cheesy! Yum! I cooked the pizza in the oven for eleven more minutes. I took it out and let it set for about ten more minutes. When cooking with stoneware, the stoneware stays hot after it&apos;s taken out of the oven for a while. This means, the food continues to bake or cook more while sitting on it.   Finished Pizza This pizza turned out awesome! It tasted really great with the picante sauce. I was little worried, but I really liked it! I used the veggies I keep normally around the apartment. Next time I make it, I may try to get some multi-color fresh peppers on it.   Sour Cream Garnish I garnished this with sour cream. I would have loved to have some fresh guacamole on it. I didn&apos;t happen to have any made this evening. I would recommend this pizza for anyone that likes to try different foods, and especially Mexican foods. It came out tasting awesome, and didn&apos;t take a lot of time to make!  Posted by Heather Pechin at 1:30 PM No comments: Email This BlogThis!

 Spinach Artichoke Dip 
 When you go out to eat, do you order the Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer? This recipe is way better than any Spinach Artichoke Dip I&apos;ve had out at the restaurants.
Ingredients:
1 Package Frozen Chopped Spinach Defrosted/Rinsed/Drained
1 12oz Can Artichokes Drained
1 16oz Package Shredded Parmesan Cheese
1 16oz Container Sour Cream
1 Cup Mayonnaise
1-2 Tbs Garlic Powder
1 Brick Cream Cheese
Ground Black Pepper to Taste
*Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
 Spinach Artichoke Dip I start by throwing the spinach and artichokes into my food processor for about 30 seconds. I throw it in my bowl after that. I use a mixing bowl that I can stick in the oven. That makes life easier! With the spinach and artichoke mixture, I put in all of the other ingredients, except the Parmesan. I put in half of the bag of Parmesan. I mix all of these ingredients together. Then, I put in in the oven and bake for around 30 minutes. I take it out at that point and put the rest of the Parmesan cheese on top. I stick it back in the oven for ten to fifteen more minutes. When the cheese is turning a pretty golden color and the edges are starting to crisp up, I take it out. I let the dish rest for ten to fifteen minutes.
I serve this with tortilla chips, french bread, and/or petite toasts. It tastes awesome! It turns out creamier than some of the recipes I&apos;ve used, or the appetizers I&apos;ve tried at the restaurants. This makes a lot of dip! Be prepared to share it with people! I&apos;ve tried to make it with light cream cheese and low fat sour cream. It came out a little bit on the watery side, but it wasn&apos;t awful. I&apos;ve seen recipes that just use mayo and another ingredient like cream cheese, but I think you need all three ingredients, the mayo, cream cheese, and sour cream to get the full creaminess!

 Pechin&apos;s Pizza Pockets 
 Ian asked me on a previous blog about making Pizza Pockets. I thought I would give it a try today. They came out OK!
Ingredients:
1 Can Home Style Biscuits
1-2 Cups Sauce (I used a jar sauce for this one.)
1 Cup Shredded Mozzarella
1 Package Sliced Pepperoni
Spray Olive Oil
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
*Preheat the oven to the temperature recommended on the can of biscuits. 
  Biscuits I opened the can of biscuits. I started by flattening out one biscuit.   Biscuit with Toppings I put on about a tsp of tomato sauce. I put on three pepperoni, and then, about a Tbl. of shredded Mozzarella. Then, I flattened out another biscuit and put it on top. After that, I pressed the sides with a fork.  The Edges Pressed with a Fork After I got them all together, I placed the pizza pockets on the pizza stone that I had spritzed with olive oil. I spritzed the top of the pockets with olive oil, and then, shook on a little bit on garlic powder on their tops. When that was done, I stuck them in the oven.  
 Pockets in the Oven I cooked them for about ten to eleven minutes. Then, I took them out and let them set on the stone for a couple more minutes. Pizza stones are known to stay quite hot even after being taken from the oven.   The Finished Pizza Pockets 
 One Pizza Pocket Pizza Pocket as a Side with Spaghetti My pizza pockets turned out pretty good! They are good by themselves, 
and they also work as a side. I served them up with Spaghetti. Posted by Heather Pechin at 11:00 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Heather Pechin , Pizza , Pizza Pockets , Pockets , Recipe

 BBQ Party Weenies 
 My favorite food at a party is always the weenies! They are always so warm and comforting sitting in that crock pot! I&apos;ll make these even if I just want them to eat at home on a cold day.
Ingredients:
2 Packages Weenies (Or More. Depends on how big your crock pot is, and how many people you need to feed.)
3 Tbs Worcester Sauce
1 Tbs Garlic or 2 Minced Garlic Cloves or Garlic Powder
1 16oz Jar Grape Jelly
1 Bottle Chili Sauce
1/3 ish Cup Water (To rinse out the Chili Sauce Bottle)
Sometimes, to get a spicier flavor, my sister adds horse radish to it. I do not.
  Ingredients in the Crock Pot 
I put the weenies in my crock pot. Then, I put in about 8 oz of the grape jelly in. I pour in my bottle of Chili Sauce. I put about 1/3 cup of water in the bottle, put the lid on the bottle, and shake it. Then, pour the water into the crock pot. Put in the Worcester Sauce and Garlic Powder. Put on the lid and walk away. I let this cook in the Crock Pot for a little over three hours. Then, I opened it and stirred.
 BBQ Weenies Cooked When the weenies and the sauce are done, they should look like this after they are stirred. You can also use this same sauce with the frozen meatballs that a lot of people buy. Some times, I even use this sauce when I&apos;m making a batch of pulled pork. I might amp it up a bit with more garlic, chili sauce, and I&apos;ll add a little bit of chili powder for seasoning. If you&apos;re in a hurry, or don&apos;t have a crock pot, you can cook the sauce in the weenies on the stove in about twenty minutes, and they still taste pretty good. I would recommend these BBQ Weenies for any party, whether it&apos;s a Birthday or Family Reunion! These will definitely be a hit!

 Little Caersars: Pizza Pizza! 
 For lunch today, Ian brought me a Sausage Pizza and Crazy Bread from Little Caersars Pizza. I&apos;m not a huge fan of this &quot;Ready when You&apos;re Ready&quot; pizza. In fact, Ian went last week and asked for a sausage pizza and was told, they only have pepperoni pizzas ready at lunch. That it would be at least five more minutes before a sausage pizza would be ready. This was a tad annoying, so, he went ahead and got pepperoni. Today, he went early enough that he could get the sausage pizza for lunch.
 Here&apos;s Little Caesars home page. No where does it say on the page that pepperoni is the only pizza available at certain times without a wait.
 
If you don&apos;t know what Little Caesars is, it&apos;s a pizza restaurant that advertises pizzas ready to go when you walk in the door. You don&apos;t need to call ahead or wait on your order or &quot;Hot-n-Ready&apos; like the box says. That was what my previous complaint about the sausage pizza was about. They also carry other things like Wings and Crazy Bread. My personal favorite from Little Caesars is the Crazy Bread. 

 I&apos;ll be the first to admit, Little Caesars may be quick and easy, but their pizza isn&apos;t always quality. It has improved in flavor over the last two years. In fact, when the Little Caesars opened across the street from my apartment, I ran over and bought a pizza and Crazy Bread. That night, the pizza had barely any flavor! Luckily, today was different! My favorite thing at Little Caesars is the Crazy Bread! It&apos;s so soft and chewy! It also comes with cheddar cheese sauce for dipping! The seasoning that&apos;s on the bread is Parmesan and garlic, which I really like.
You can tell today&apos;s was super greasy though! The bread was still pretty good!
I give Little Caesars 1 1/2 pizza pies out of 4. It&apos;s pizza is not one of my go to pizzas. It&apos;s improving it&apos;s flavor. I do like the Crazy Bread. That&apos;s what I really go back for, not the pizza.  Posted by Heather Pechin at 7:25 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis!

 Sausage Fiesta Dip 
 I love dips! This one is a quick easy dip that can be taken to parties or just eaten at home!
Ingredients:
1 Lb. Roll of Hot Sausage (Mild can be substituted.)
1 Can of Rotel Tomatoes and Chilis
1 Brick of Cream Cheese
1 Bag of Tortilla Chips
 Sausage Fiesta Dip Brown the sausage. While that&apos;s browning, put the brick of cream cheese in a microwave safe bowl. Open the can of Rotel and drain a little of the water off. Put the Rotel on top and microwave for a minute. Take it out and see if you can stir it. If the cream cheese is still stiff, heat for another 45 seconds. Take it out and stir again. When the meat is down browning, drain off the grease. Then, put it in the microwave safe bowl with the other ingredients, and stir them up.   Serve this with the tortilla chips. With the hot sausage, it can get really spicy. That&apos;s why I use mild sometimes, give my stomach a break. I like the flavor both ways.
