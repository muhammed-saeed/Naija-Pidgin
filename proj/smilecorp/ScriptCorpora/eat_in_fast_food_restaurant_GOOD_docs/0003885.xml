I wanted to give Chick-fil-A a try for many many months but every time I had the opportunity to go I realized it was a Sunday and they&apos;re closed Sunday!

Finally, I got a chance to go on a weekday around 6:30PM.  It must of been meant to be because there was no drive-thru wait!  I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwhich, and an order of nuggets.  The service was great, the people at the window gave the impression they were excited to be at work.  It was kind of strange, but it added to the experience of going for the first time!

The Spicy Chicken Sandwhich was great.  I can&apos;t really describe how the chicken tasted but it was nice and hot, and had a &quot;light&quot; feeling when chewing.

The only problem I have with this place is the price, but I&apos;d rather pay for quality tasting food and that it is.  Unfortunately due to this high price it kept me from ordering another sandwhich -- but that didn&apos;t last for long, the last time I went I order a Spicy Chicken Sandwhich and an order of nuggets.  The nuggets were good, especially with the dipping sauce but beware of the high fructose corn syrup in the sauce.. you might want to stray away from the sauce if you&apos;re over weight and at risk of diabetes!  Just saying.. but hey, you&apos;re at a fast food joint.. pay up and eat up!!

My mom was eager to stop at Chick-fil-A since this is in her comfort area, anywhere outside this... she is not going to venture to.  Also, no worries because she had me, her personal chauffeur!  Off we went to Chick-fil-A, which was quite busy... and by busy, I mean lots of children and babies.  We went in and stood in line, but the line went really quickly.  I went with the classic sandwich, while my mom went with the deluxe one with lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  The lady asked if we wanted any sauces, so I asked for BBQ, although I was hesitant because at some of the Chick-fil-As I have been to, they charge for sauces (and yes, I am surprised to hear there is a location where the sauces are just out as a self serve...)!

While I think it is great that they bring your food to you, it seems like they need to work on this aspect of their service.  Sure the staff are friendly, but efficiently... well they need work.  The first instance, one of the waitresses was walking around with a tray of food, but couldn&apos;t find the people who ordered it.  She just kept walking around.  The lady taking orders at the counter finally came out, saw what had happened, then said, &quot;She already got her order.&quot;  This all happened as they stood behind the lady who&apos;s order had been replicated and she looked rather annoyed.  Our order came out, but no extra BBQ sauce.  Had we been charged for it, I would&apos;ve tracked her down, but seeing as they had other orders missing things left and right, I figured sauce was the least of their worries.

A couple next to us were missing a sandwich and told the guy who delivered their order.  He walked off, then a few minutes later asked what happened, so the couple again said that they were missing a sandwich.  So he went back and got a receipt, came back and looked very confused.  The couple was getting agitated.  He disappeared again.  Yes... I was watching all of this as my mom was on the phone with work, another state inspection... and people watching is a past time of mine.  Anyway, finally the guy came back and explained that he rang up something else instead of a sandwich and the lady would need to follow him back to the register and pay for the difference.  Needless to say they weren&apos;t very happy.  There were a couple more orders delivered that were missing items and one order was out and being delivered before the lady found a table to sit down because she was busy getting condiments!

Like I said, I do like my food being brought out, instead of waiting awkwardly in everyone&apos;s way for my food, but I think they may waste more time running back and forth because they are delivering incorrect orders or orders that have not been completed.  Other than that, the food was as I expected... I like Chick-fil-A, but only once in awhile... when I want something that I haven&apos;t had in awhile.  The staff needs to work on efficiency.

I&apos;m embarrassed to admit my son and I usually find our way here 2x/week.

I am loud and proud to tell everyone that while the food is okay (better than other FF choices); I mostly come because the people that work there are so polite and it is an absolutely refreshing experience.

I bet I&apos;ve told at least 5 people I go here just so I can hear someone in the service business act as though they are actually appreciative of my business and glad to take my order.  I&apos;m certain it&apos;s all a part of their training program; I for one don&apos;t care how they do it; I am just glad that they do.

Awesome job in all aspects.......they have young energetic staff members who enjoy service.  It is really not fair to call this fast food because they actually create an experience around the customer not a factory built to churn thru product and people quickly.  All the people smile, speak English, and take care of ur needs.

Another convenient location!  I usually don&apos;t eat fast food, but at least chick-fil-a uses real chicken.  I&apos;ve done protein style before with just the lettuce wrap and it&apos;s pretty good; it just doesn&apos;t get you full.

Scored a groupon deal for 120 nuggets for $23 and split that 4 ways.  Nuggets are the real deal with real chicken and not that MCD pink slime.  Also, these nuggets are smaller than your MCD ones.

Overall, I don&apos;t feel like crap after eating here, but that all depends on what I order.  Fast food will always be fast food.

It&apos;s hard for me to put the politics of the company aside, but the nuggets sure are good.  I give Chick-fil-A a permanent -1 based on their founder&apos;s Southern Baptist rhetoric.

I can&apos;t say that I am a HUGE fan but you&apos;re looking for an alternative to a greasy burger, CFA is not a bad choice.

Don&apos;t come in here thinking you&apos;re going to get a fryer here because they only serve sandwiches and wraps along with a variety of sides. Unlike other places, CFA&apos;s healthy choice, the char grilled chicken is very good.  The sides vary from tasty (waffle fries) to healthy (fruit cup) with a few selections in between.

For me personally, this will never replace the classic burger joint however if I am really feeling health conscious on any given day, CFA is a-ok in my book.

This place provided my work free sandwiches a week or so before opening, about a few hundred people. I was at another location working that day = (

But I was given a coupon for some free sandwiches and used one yesterday. I got the breakfast biscuit, I loved the actually biscuit and was surprised at how large the sandwich was! The girl asked me if I wanted any dipping sauce and I said no, because I thought they would have them all laid out at the sauce station, but no? The Chick Fil A in Temecula has TONS of sauces, all I saw here was hot sauce and ketchup, mustard, etc. No BBQ, Honey mustard, special sauces. BOOOOOO!!
I&apos;ll probably come back for the chocolate peppermint shake though.

OK, so I must say that I&apos;m a fan of Chick-fil-A&apos;s chicken strips with Polynesian sauce, buffalo sauce and the occasional Chick-fil-A sauce.

Now that I know they have free wifi, this is a great stop after I pick up the kid from school. The play area is clean and enclosed so all the ruckus stays inside and I can still keep an eye on the sitch.

I haven&apos;t had a salad here and it doesn&apos;t sound like I will anytime soon from the other reviews, but this is one of my fav local stops with the kids.

Okay, at first I thought it was okay. But me and my fiance kept coming back because it&apos;s close and he likes it. Now, it&apos;s grown on me. I usually order the spicy chicken sandwich on a wheat bun, waffle fries, and sweet tea. Tasty!

Star #1: Flavorful food. Check.
Star #2: Food causes cravings. Check.
Star #3: Price worthiness. Check.
Star #4: Decent service. Check! They bring out your food to you!
Star #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). No.

4/5 stars. Not bad!

Oh side note: Watch out if you try to cross the street on the left side of the building by the drive through. It&apos;s a blind spot for the drivers. I always watch out whether or not I&apos;m in the car or on the street. Don&apos;t want to hit someone or get hit!

The good: friendly service. the little kid area. the sauces. the breakfast.

the bad: if you want to eat healthy, don&apos;t come here...the grilled chicken sandwiches are not good.  it&apos;s always busy at this location.

Ask for the different sauces!

I wish I had Yelp-searched *before* I went. Looks like this place is taking just one long shower of shit from the public these days. I would have given 1-star, but I feel bad for the arrogant owner lady who could use a 3-star assist right now, just to keep from going any further down.

Look, I expected grilled, not fried, breaded, oily.  I hate that stuff. I feel as though it was not as advertised and my experience seems to be shared.

Somebody please get a message to that southern lady who snootily refused to even consider my complaint when I brought it to her attention that I was looking for grilled. Basic courtesy ought to get a person to think about what they can do to help a customer out. I got none of that.

3-stars is a lifeline southern bosslady! Take the hint.

I used to go to another 3-syllable place down from L.A. that specialized in what is supposed to be good, clean chicken, but they seem to have vanished from San Diego.

This particular Chick-Fil-A offers &quot;wilted and slimy&quot; salad, others have said. Some have claimed food poisoning and fear of food poisoning. Well me too.

I know there is a drought on and it is tough economic times, but gosh, can&apos;t people pay attention to food safety anymore? Something like that makes me worry that the kids I saw running the place wouldn&apos;t know a listeria outbreak if it bit them in the leg.

Better tighten up that kitchen protocol my friends! I&apos;d be happy to try you again when you do since the pictures of the chicken look yummy.

After reading the reviews (and one by a friend I saw), I had to go see if it was really as bad as all that today, especially since they are right across the street from me in CMR. Look, if you read my other stuff you can see that I am about kid-friendly and cleanliness. Nice non-processed chicken nuggets are about as kid friendly as it gets.

Food-borne illness is NOT! What they say about salad is still not fixed.

So you may say: Why not just avoid that salad, Em? Well, its like the old adage of &quot;if you see one cockroach, there are more to be lurking out of sight&quot; or the phrase &quot;tip of the iceberg.&quot; If the lettuce is mishandled, what else is being mishandled? I think that is a fair question.

I am going to give this place a few more months to pull their personal thing together and whip staff into shape, then do a return visit and update. I would *love* for this place to be a reliable place to take the kiddies.

We had been past the Chick-Fil-A a number of times but had not ever gone in. The place is always heaving and the queue for the drive through is always long.

We had been moving into our new place and needed something substantial to eat so we chose Chick-Fil-A it was average.

I have to say that:
a) I have no idea why it is so popular, its barely average food.
b) They put too much ice in the drink so you dont have enough drink to go with your food.
c) It didnt fill me up. Yes I went for just chicken pieces rather than in a bun but still you would expect it to be filling.
d) The cross cut fries were cold- yes I should have complained but having waited about 10 minutes to get served and a further 10 for the food I was in a bad mood.

Will I go again? Possibly. Maybe it was a bad day... though given the other reviews I may well be avoiding!

This Chick-Fill-Lay is super new and so it is super spiffy clean. Even the indoor kiddie romper room is still (probably) free of the usual typhoid that contaminates these things as the little ones drag their gummy noses on the surfaces.

It actually looks like the same people who do Carl&apos;s and the new McD&apos;s layouts did the interior of this place. Seems to be there is an &quot;off the shelf fast food modern&quot; interior design available.

I simply do not like how much grease remains on my chicken here. The 3-lettered chicken place has less even. I wish they would somehow blot this better, but I am not even sure that would help. I must warn others who dislike oil to beware.

BTW: The cow holding the sign saying &quot;Elekt chikin for brekfist samwich&quot; is cute, so they get more than zero stars.

I think my reviews have made clear what I think of grease. I have also said how I don&apos;t like it on floors, with Smashburger PQ being a prime example to be not like. In food, even less so.

I am hoping for better than what I had: drippy, gloppy, not what I have been told to expect from this brand. I wonder if these franchisees are going to get a talking to from corporate about letting the product slide like that.

I see the other reviews calling for them to get better. I will make my review update substantially better if I see progress.

I know it&apos;s a newer location but this location has major issues with customer service.

I go through the drive through.  I get a breakfast combo.  I order coffee.  I ask if they can add the cream and sugar.  I have now been told 4 times - they can&apos;t do that.  They always say &quot;It will be my pleasure&quot; but every time I ask about this I am told they wont do it.  And the worst part is they always overfill the coffee cup so when I go to add in the cream and sugar it spills all over me.  I just love going to work with stained clothes stinking of coffee.

Today I went through the drive through hoping the weekend service was better.  We were on our way to a birthday party.  I asked what they had for a kids breakfast meal and they tell me something about a 4 count.  I have my son screaming in the back seat that he wants a toy.  I said I will take that kids meal.  I don&apos;t know what the car in front of me ordered - but there was just one car.  We sat there for about 15 minutes - I timed it - waiting on the order for that one car.  I get to the drive through window and they hand me my order.  It&apos;s cold.  And they have a 4 count breakfast mini thing.  With no toy.  They don&apos;t apologize for the horrific wait.  At least at Mc Donalds they would have sent the first car to park and given the rest of the line their order and they would have apologized about the wait.

At this point I&apos;m annoyed - the drive through line is now wrapped all the way around the store so I park and take my son in.  I have to wait in line AGAIN and ask to speak to a manager.  I explain that I wanted a kids meal.  She tells me I must have ordered wrong.  I asked if they couldn&apos;t hear Mikey screaming that he wanted a toy?  I specifically said a meal for a kid.  Why is she arguing with me?  I thought the customer was always right?  Then I ask about the cream and sugar.  She says they can&apos;t put cream and sugar into a drink because it&apos;s a health department regulation and it&apos;s considered tampering with the drink.  Now I&apos;m really really annoyed and I point out that McDonalds and Burger King will do this.  She quickly backtracks and says they will do it on request.  I state that I had been there 4 times that month and was told they couldn&apos;t do it.

So I overpaid for the kids meal I had to walk in to get and didn&apos;t even get an apology or a refund of the difference.  I wasted 25 minutes on a visit that should have taken 5 and was late to the birthday party.  And I would up smelling like coffee because the cup was overfull AGAIN.

I obviously like the spicy chicken biscuits or I wouldn&apos;t have gone back - but this last visit may have killed it for me.

After an early morning flight, getting a rental car, making my way to my friend&apos;s house, bringing in my luggage, picking up a grocery list, hitting up a Costco, dropping off items from Costco, having to go to another Costco, then Sprouts, I was hungry and man oh man, was I happy to see Chick Fil-A.

I am a long term Chick Fil-A fan since my childhood in Phoenix when they would offer free samples of delicious chicken at Metro Center Mall but I digress. Why I cannot give this place 5 stars is because of their politics but damn, that chicken is fried to perfection and they do have some great iced tea.

It was a successful stop, relatively inexpensive and if/when given another opportunity, I would eat here again.

Oh, just a reminder folks, this company is closed on Sundays...

So what would you want from a fast food franchise? Fast and food, right? I got neither here. I guess it is karma.

I had high hopes for a fast, clean-eating lunch here, because it is so convenient to my work. Nope.

They have bugs in their system they need to iron out. Seriously. They can&apos;t count change, they can&apos;t take an order right, they make you repeat yourself three times and still blow it, then they make you wait. The reason the drive thru always has such a long line is probably not because of demand. It is because they are slooooooow.

Let&apos;s see if I can just go ahead and land a punch here: what a scheisseloch for service!

Do your people get *any* training in customer service? Mumbling and muttering and basically not apologizing is a ridiculous way to behave.

Why? I had received the wrong order twice on the same day during dine-in service. It was like they got their number system all mixed up. Sort of a waste of time if you ask me.

Nice and new. In 2 years it will be sticky everywhere with that thin sheen of old grease that all fast food places have, and then they will be left with nothing but the goofy service unless they pull their thing together.

Chick Fil a provided my work with sandwiches a week before their opening in the area and it reminded me of how yummy they are. I love the spicy chicken sandwiches with the criss cut fries. They have a great spicy chicken salad called the southwest that you can get with a spicy dressing that is great.

You do need a little patience when coming here because they are not the fastest fast food restaurant.

I try to avoid fast food as much as possible, but I was really busy and really  starving one day while up in Carmel Mountain, so I decided to try Chick Fil a.

I got the 8 piece chicken nuggets.  These were not your ordinary processed  chicken nuggets.  These were hot and fresh and actually shredded like real chicken.  It wasn&apos;t the mashed ball of stuff that I am used to in fast food nuggets.

I felt like there was a lot too!  So by the time I got home, I added some fresh lettuce to it and made a what I think was a pretty decent salad!

I feel like I can eat at Chick Fil a and feel a little better about what I ate than most fast food places.

I still won&apos;t be there often, but I am a fan now :)

The food and service at this location is horrible, Ive eaten here twice the first time is when they opened so, i decided to give them another chance same story nothing is fresh chicken was cold fries where cold the service is below average. Maybe management should take a really good look at its operation.

After hearing so many great things about Chick Fil a I finally decided to try it. The service was pretty fast and very polite. But food quality I was definitely disappointed.

The number 2 was lacking in sauce and the chicken was just mediocre. I had heard that this place was better than McDonalds and KFC but definitely not. I would take either over Chick Fil a. I think I will try something beyond their standard sandwiches in the future. Their sides look very appetizing.

Fries were flavorless and I felt like I had to drown everything in sauce in order to make it edible. The reason that I give this establishment two stars instead of one is the fact that this place has a play pen so it is friendly for children and I do feel like the service here is a little better than your typical fast food restaurant.

I will be coming back to try other foods, I might have just ordered the wrong thing.

Love chick fila. I&apos;m from the south and grew up with it. Always hits the spot. This particular location doesn&apos;t seem to have the service process ironed out yet. Still good chicken though.

YES!

This place is a couple-minute drive away from my workplace.

As with all Chik-Fil-A&apos;s, the food is great.  I&apos;m used to going to the ones in Walnut and Moreno Valley back in LA and the Inland Empire, respectively.

I stayed in the car since it was lunch time and they&apos;re having mega promos (it looked rather busy from the outside).  But the lunch rush didn&apos;t affect their drive-thru window... I had my #3 meal with a sweet tea in less than two minutes and got some Honey Roasted BBQ sauce to go along with it.

The Spicy Chicken Sandwich is the perfect balance of heat and tender meat.  The tea is refreshing and really, really easy to finish off in a couple sips (it&apos;s times like this I wish I&apos;d eaten in the store so I can capitalize on the free refills).

The only reason why I didn&apos;t give these guys a 5-star rating is because I felt a bit short changed on the waffle fries.  They need to fill that sucker up to the brim at least (I don&apos;t like seeing the top curve of the box bare).  Back at home, the waffle fries spilled out of the container.

My husband and I came to Chick fil A this weekend to grab a bite to eat late at night. My husband is on a strict diet, so he just got a salad. I had the spicy chicken sandwich. My chicken was undercooked and pink. The salad he got was wilted and slimy. He ended up getting food poisoning from eating the salad. He has not gone out to eat at a fast food place in a long time, so he was already hesitant. Id never go back again. Unless you want food poisoning like my husband.

This place is ran like a well oiled machine.  I got there and I was immediately helped and given my order number.  As I sat down in my booth, I could see that even though it was busy, the workers made sure the tables were clean.  I also noticed one of the managers telling his staff to sweep up the floors.  Like I said a well oiled machine and super clean. I ordered the crispy chicken club and it was delicious.  Some of my potatoes were a little soggy though.  Hence the four star rating.  Overall a good experience.

Absolutely delicious! Their chicken sandwiches are fried, yes, but in peanut oil so it&apos;s healthier! :) The food is always hot, fresh, and delish! Also, the customer service is supurb! Me and the Hubby must have been asked 3 times if we needed a refil and if we were doing okay! I grew up with this place in Georgia and I am so happy to have it here in my neck of the woods! :)

My kids love this place because of the indoor play room. I like it because there are two sizes of kids&apos; meals and I can get a tasty bowl of chicken soup and a salad or a grilled chicken wrap that&apos;s big enough to save half for dinner.  We have never had to wait long and the service has always been friendly.

Although this place has decent food, they have got my order wrong for the 4th time in a row!! There is something ALWAYS MISSING or wrong! I have tried speaking clearly and making sure they hear me and all they can say is &quot;it&apos;s my pleasure&quot; and it is so annoying!! It&apos;s like are you even listening to my order? Anywho, make sure you always check your to go bag before leaving this place cause you don&apos;t want to pay for something you NEVER GOT!

I never had chick fil a but saw it around.  This place is a great alternative to the burger.  Chicken is the best in fast-food.  Great sauce.  Nice design.

why is chick fil-a so good ?

why do they have so many delicious sauces ?

why do they make bomb milkshakes ?

yummo-o.

This place used to be the sleep-train... completely moved the sleep train to another spot on the strip mall so they could open up this beauty just in case anyone was wondering &quot;didn&apos;t this used to be a sleep train!?&quot;

I have been to other Chick-Fil-A&apos;s and this one is bad compared to the others.  The food was good, but the service was slow.  The staff was very nice but they were clueless about running the place.  It took them 40 minutes to prepare my order.  The line was out the door and the staff looked lost.  I thought it was just a busy day, so I gave this location another chance since I&apos;m a big fan of Chick-Fil-A.  The second try was not busy but they still seemed lost.  Please corporate send someone out to train these people

Kinda surprised to see so many bad reviews for this place. I eat here once in awhile for lunch since I work not too far away. Granted, this place still is fast food, but compared to chicken you would get at most fast food spots, I feel there&apos;s is a cut above. Unfortunately, and why it loses stars, its also priced higher than any other location. I could understand if it was due to higher material costs, but walk into this location just once, and you know its spent on payroll. I had one person take my order, who turned around to give my order to someone else, who gave it to the kitchen, who then gave it to someone else to give to me.... this was all within an area of 4 feet. I understand they pride themselves on customer service but that was just absurd. It was a job that should&apos;ve and would&apos;ve been done by one, maybe two people in any other spot. And thats not even mentioning the two managers they had behind the counter at the same time this was happening. So to sum it up, I believe there were three registers, with about 8-9 people behind the counter making this place run. But other than that, I haven&apos;t had any other issue with this location, and wont have any issue coming back.
