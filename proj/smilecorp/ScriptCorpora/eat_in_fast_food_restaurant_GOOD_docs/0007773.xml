 (Newser) –
 There are a lot of theories as to why Sbarro filed for bankruptcy last month—including“too-rapid growth”and the decline of malls. But Justin Peters has“a simpler explanation: Nobody likes Sbarro,”he writes in Slate .“Devoid of atmosphere, charm, and gustatory relevance, with no signature product to call its own, it&apos;s America&apos;s least essential restaurant.”On top of that, a simple slice of pizza sets you back $3.49.

But plenty of people do eat at Sbarro. Peters set out on a mission to find out why, stopping by four locations in three states. A Sbarro in Illinois was full of teens; DC’s Union Station branch was full of commuters and tourists; in New York City, two Sbarros were“packed.”Essentially, it“seems as though Sbarro courts the indifferent eater—tourists, children, people who just want a slice and a place to sit while they talk about the amazing pants they saw on sale at The Limited.”These days, however, that may not be enough.
