 Here at Frieling,we seem to do a few things differently than other companies (for the better,we think). That&apos;s in fact how the Frieling Feeling was coined - a befitting expression that suddenly appeared. Is it contagious? You bet! Is that bad? We don&apos;t think so,because so many of our customer friends have been with us since the beginning and come back for more of that Frieling Feeling. Frieling constantly seeks better solutions to make life in the kitchen easier,healthier,more enjoyable,more convenient. Such a focused approach synergistically integrates several product categories,creating a convenient&quot;one stop shop&quot;for the American consumers.

 Pizza Express near the Tower of London 

 Advantages: Nice location, good food, family friendly
 Disadvantages: None


...Pizza Express has long been one of my favourite restaurants for a little bit of Italian food, be it pizza, pasta or some sweet Italian treats. Now I am a mum too I know its a good choice for my little girl when it comes to a family friendly restaurant with good wholesome food that she will be able to eat and enjoy.

We recently went to London Zoo for the day and afterwards we went to meet my husband at his office in Trinity Square which is right opposite the Tower of London. Its a beautiful location and just round the corner from that is a Pizza Express restaurant so it was a great place for is to go for an early dinner that everyone would enjoy. 

We went in about 6pm and at that time the restaurant was not too busy so we had our pick of seats which was nice. We chose to go near the back as this way were were out of the way a bit if my...

Review of Pizza Express , London 
 
 Pizza Express Margherita Pizza 

 Advantages: Tasty, easy to cook, good value for money
 Disadvantages: None


...Since becoming a mummy, life has changed a lot. No more care-free drunken nights out on the town&amp;no more meals out whenever I and my boyfriend feel like it. Instead, we stay in pretty much every night with a film and a meal in, which sounds boring but I love it! I usually make all of our meals from scratch, however last Saturday we had to make a quick trip to Tesco to get some Easter eggs for some family members and I noticed these pizzas perched at the end of one of the aisles on offer - I love pizza express so I picked one up and popped it into my basket as at 2.50 instead of the full RRP of 5 it was a bargain!

There was only the largest (510 and 480 gram) pizzas reduced and there are smaller ones too - 245 grams and 305 grams (RRP 4 each). Although the full RRP for the large pizzas (5) does seem expensive, in my opinion it...

Review of Pizza Express Margherita 12 inch Pizza 
 
 Pizza Express Pinner 

 Advantages: Good quality pizza, nice ambience and decor, money off vouchers accepted
 Disadvantages: Honestly, none that I can think of considering the good level of service and pretty good pizza


...Introduction

I have been a customer of Prezzo and Pizza Express restaurants for many years, and occasionally I do like visiting a wide range of restaurants from a range of cuisines. The Pizza Express chain like Prezzo specialise in making good pizza. The Pizza Express is Italian style pizza restaurant. The one thing I have noted in Pizza Express chain restaurants over the years is that the restaurant products and service is the same whichever restaurant that is visited, although the decor is slightly varied from appearing slightly rustic to a more modern contemporary style. 

Getting There

We drove here as it is very close by to places such as Ruislip as well as Harrow on the Hill. There is a Metropolitan line tube station a short walk to the restaurant as well. There are plenty of buses that serve commuters from Harrow...
