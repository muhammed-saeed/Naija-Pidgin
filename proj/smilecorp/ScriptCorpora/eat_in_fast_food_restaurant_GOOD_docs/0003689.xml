 User: When McDonald&apos;s entered into an agreement with a French entrepreneur who wanted to own and operate a McDonald&apos;s fast-food restaurant in Paris, it saw the new restaurant as an opportunity. Unfortunately, the restaurant in Paris was not maintained at the cleanliness standards prescribed by McDonald&apos;s but at the cleanliness standards acceptable to the French. McDonald&apos;s brought legal action to have the restaurant closed. This example illustrates: 
 a. an opportunity for McDonald&apos;s to enter into more joint ventures
 b. a need for McDonald&apos;s to curtail its international franchising
 c. a cultural threat against McDonald&apos;s
 d. a weakness within the McDonald&apos;s franchising system
 e. a problem with franchising in different cultures

 Weegy: The best answer is E. a problem with franchising in different cultures. Rationale: cross-cultural franchises are especially vulnerable to cultural conflicts and misunderstandings.
