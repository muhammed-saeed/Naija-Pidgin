Hard to find even though it&apos;s on 9A in ELmsford (RIght next to Wendys fast food restaurant)  This place has great Hot Dawgs.  I love the New York City Dog with Sauerkraut and mustard and the Zorro with secret chipotle sauce, sauteed onions and relish.

If you are anywhere near Elmsford, NY this place is certainly worth finding if your hungry for a tasty hot dog or two or three!

This place is down the road from where I work. I had no idea it was there until a bunch of us stumbled upon it. It&apos;s set back from the road so hard to see.
They&apos;re specialty is hot dogs. You can a wide variety of toppings. My favorite is &quot;Cheddah Heaven.&quot;
They also have cheesesteaks, chicken wings, onion rings (which are the best I&apos;ve ever had)
The people working there are also very friendly.
Everyone at my job have become regulars there.

What a find!  A great hot dog is not easy to find and these are perfect.  All beef dogs with a snap to them.  They have a big selection of topping to match anyones taste.  Be careful to not drive by this place.  Well worth the stop.

They really take their time to make the most amazing stuff! Try the AM hotdog. You will be surprised how good it is. We had to call them back and let them know just how good!
