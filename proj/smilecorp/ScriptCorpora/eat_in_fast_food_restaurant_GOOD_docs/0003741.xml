 Hampton Commonwealth&apos;s Attorney candidates spar at debate 
 By Peter Dujardin, pdujardin@dailypress.com | 757-247-4749 | May 29, 2012 Two Democratic candidates for Hampton&apos;s top prosecutor post sparred Tuesday in a spirited forum at Hampton City Hall over voting histories, residency issues and money for a witness protection program. Deputy Commonwealth&apos;s Attorney Anton Bell, one of the candidates for the post, assured the audience that he voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, telling a questioner that any notion that he voted for John McCain that year is false. His opponent, Dee Vantree-Keller, has been contending in recent weeks that she&apos;s the &quot;only Democrat&quot; in the race, in light of Bell&apos;s statement to pastors that he voted for Mike Huckabee in the 2008 Republican presidential primary.

 Virginia&apos;s judge-selection process criticized by Lt. Gov. Bolling 
 By Ashley Kelly and Peter Dujardin | December 11, 2011 A man planning to be Virginia&apos;s next governor wants the state to revamp its judicial selection system. Lt. Gov.

 A More Playful Kind Of Detective Work 
 By DAVID CHERNICKY Daily Press | June 28, 1998 Baseball cards never interested Detective Morgen Tietjens as a young boy. Neither did collecting stamps, coins or other memorabilia. It wasn&apos;t until a lieutenant in the Newport News police department introduced him to Road Champs, a series of die-cast model police cars, that Tietjens adopted his first hobby. &quot;There was a friend of mine who gave me a reproduction of the Phoenix police car. She had bought it in Phoenix while attending a school there,&quot; Tietjens said. He wondered whether the company reproduced patrol cars of other states and departments in the same 1:43 scale and asked Lt. Larry Roberts, commander of the department&apos;s Crime Scene Technical Unit. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Next NEWS
