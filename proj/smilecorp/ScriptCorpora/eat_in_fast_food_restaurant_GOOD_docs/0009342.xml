 Marshawn Lynch Serving Up Beast Mode at Chick-Fil-A 
 Posted by ddish81 on Jan 28, 2012 in New Post , NFL | 5 comments 
 
Marshawn Lynch has taken up an off-season job at Chick-Fil-A and is serving up a huge helping of Beast Mode!

Marshawn is a hard-working man, so when the NFL season wrapped up he took up a winter job serving chicken sandwiches with Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Josh Johnson at a Chick-Fil-A. Watch as Lynch and Johnson take orders from surprised fans who are just looking to get a little lunch. Marshawn does not look that out-of-place working at a fast food restaurant and the service he provides is about on par with an actual Chick-Fil-A employee.

Here are a few more pictures from Mr. Lynch’s fast food adventure :
