We played a bunch of games of this once it arrived. It&apos;s a shame that
you need three players to play, but we got our non-gamer friend to
play and she really liked it.

The element of being close to winning, trying to create a string of
cards makes the game exciting. A good mix of strategy and chance.

We are a group of eight year old girls, and we like this game very much -- it is easy to learn, and easy to play. It is fast moving, and so we can play several games, and more of us get a chance to win. The card art and text are silly and fun. Passing the brain around is a great idea, and winning when you&apos;ve played all your cards also works well. We also enjoy the 3 Stooges card game, and play the Settlers of Catan card game when we have the time.

Just one of many ways to lose your brain in this fast, fun, and exceptionally silly game. But don&apos;t worry, someone will drop it soon, and you&apos;ll have posession of the brain again. Simply thinking about this game gives me a chuckle. It&apos;s perfect as an icebreaker game, or to close the evening out - esp when you don&apos;t have time to start a long game. The brain [actually a 6 sided die that you supply] gets passed around more than a glass pipe at a Phish show. It usually plays pretty quick, say under 20 minutes. While the jokes can get weak with extended play, it never gets stale at my house. We play it whenever someone asks for it or when new people come over for games. That&apos;s just about right.

The zombie artwork and captions will keep everyone in stiches.&apos;What&apos;s that on the sneeze guard?&apos; A zombie making change by cutting up a dollar bill. &apos;That&apos;s NOT mayonnaise... but whatever it is, you don&apos;t want any.&apos;
