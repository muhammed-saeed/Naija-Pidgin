 “Dream as if you’ll live forever, live as if you’ll die today.” ~James Dean

   How often do you sit back and reflect? It happens to me often. I find myself calm, relaxed, and gazing off in to what is my past. I often wonder just how I got to where I am and, naturally, what the future will hold. Too others I am staring off into space but inside, in my mind I am looking through a window in to my past. Seeing events unfold, feeling happiness and loss, and in general just reflecting on what I’ve decided on for my life.

   I’ve noticed for a while now that time seems to have no relevance for me. Others can tell you what happened to them yesterday, last week, and if it was memorable two weeks ago or even a year ago. For me everything in my life appears to have happened yesterday. It’s like the timeline is blurred or has even been removed but the events are oh so vivid. Everything for me happened yesterday, you see.

   Yesterday, I was sitting in my bedroom consumed by learning to teach my brand new Commodore Vic-20 how to say“Hello World!”. Yesterday, I was walking through the halls of my high school laughing with my friends. Yesterday, I was a night shift maintenance man for a fast food restaurant and married. Yesterday, I was working for a security company answering telephones and getting divorced. Yesterday, I was living in Upstate New York and driving eight hours one way to spend weekends with my girlfriend. Yesterday, I moved back home to Indiana and began driving a tractor-trailer. Yesterday, that tractor-trailer nearly killed me and my brother altering my perceptions forever. And yesterday I got on an airplane in Indiana and got off of that airplane in Arizona to once again start my yesterdays over again but with the love of my life. Yesterday, I kissed her for the first time as I got off of that airplane. Now, I’m told that I actually got off of that airplane nearly two years ago but you see, too me it was ALL just yesterday. Too me it is so VERY clear, in my mind.

   And in looking through the looking-glass I find that, for the most part, I’ve always wanted the same things and always truly loved the same things. I value silence, I require calm, and I need someone to love me. I am happiest when these things are in place. My happiest moments have always been sitting with the woman who I love and in casual conversation looking into her eyes and seeing myself in the reflection. You can see a lot if you pay close enough attention, you can see someone’s soul. The women that I’ve been with have had to learn that they truly can not lie to me. You can tell me that you’re happy, you can even put on a smile, but I can see it. I can see it in your eyes. If your eyes aren’t smiling then something’s not right.

   Some of the things I’ve learned through time is in order to maintain my calm I have to leave some things alone. For instance, I don’t watch the news. The media, in general, is completely filled with negativity and I can’t allow that into my life. Evidently that negativity sells, I guess people love misery. I’m not sure about others, but for me I prefer the calming feeling deep inside of me that comes from being blissfully ignorant of what society is feeding you tonight.

   Some lessons I’ve learned throughout my time, easy things that you likely already know but simply refuse to apply to your life are firstly I am in control of me. I am in control of my happiness. Happiness does not come from things, or other people, or ANY external source. Happiness is within you, it’s how you view life, it’s you. I think it’s a shame that as we grow into adulthood most of us lose sight of our childhood dreams and even worse we seem to simply stop dreaming altogether as it’s impractical. I prefer to be impractical, I suppose, because I’ve never really lost touch with that kid inside of me.

   Most people don’t even know that I’ve always wanted to be a writer. When I was younger I would write, in pencil or pen on paper, all the time. I wanted a typewriter but don’t recall ever having one. Then, as I grew, I lost sight of that dream. Lost in the daily grind that our society would have you to believe is the way life is supposed to be. Well here I am fulfilling that dream now, though it may have taken me around thirty years (remember that everything happened yesterday for me, but based on my age this is a pretty good guess).

   What I hope that people will learn from me is pretty simple really. Stop being in such a hurry. Life has trained you to rush. So much so that on your day off, from whatever it is that you do, you are still in rush mode. Don’t believe me? On your next day off, on an outing to the store or the mall or where ever you are going take inventory of yourself. Check out why it is that you are speeding, even just a little bit, or why traffic is really bothering you so much. Why are you in a hurry exactly? Then there is that whole“living for the weekend”mentality. Do you realize that there are FIVE days in the week and only TWO on the weekend? If you are so unhappy with your choices in life that you only wish to live TWO out of SEVEN days then I’d suggest that you take a step back and seriously decide what makes you happy and then GO DO THAT instead. The World is full of people but what the world truly needs is ALIVE people. So find what makes you truly happy, and live everyday as if it were your last. After all, tomorrow is promised to NO ONE.

   Every moment of everyday is yours, no one else’s. If you choose to share that moment with someone then you’ll most definitely grow, learn, and likely enjoy that moment even more. But it is your moment so the choices are yours. Take time, reflect, take it slow. You know if you wish to truly be happy you truly do just need to look within. Find your inner child once again, reconnect with him / her and never lose touch with yourself again. Just as you must put food into your mouth to feed your body you must feed your soul and I believe to do that you must be doing what you truly enjoy and you must be stopping to smell the flowers along the journey.

   Step back and take stock of yourself, take time to find yourself again, and believe in dreams. If you allow your inner child to begin dreaming again you’ll find your inner peace and you’ll find yourself along the way. Fulfill your dreams, strive for what you truly want in life, be and stay inspired. Be ever-present in today, think positively for your thoughts are everything, and wear a smile. You’re only here for a short time so make the very most of it, be true to yourself and you’ll truly be happy!

   Yes, I find the looking-glass most enjoyable and most calming. Even the bad moments because they show me just how wondrous the good moments truly are. It use to bother me that my looking glass’time line appears to be broken but I’ve come to realize that time is irrelevant anyway. What truly matters is what truly matters to you, what does matter to you? What causes you to come alive?

 

   When you find yourself daydreaming, what is it that you were dreaming off? Enjoy every moment, be truly ALIVE in all that you do. And remember that all things are decided by you, if you’re not happy then you’re wasting time being unhappy, and time is a very precious thing indeed. Time is all that we have, memories are all that we have in the end. Make certain that you are happy more than you are not, so that when you’re sitting back and looking through the glass the next time you at least have a smile on your face to the person that sees you are daydreaming.

I like this article. It says many things. I think we all need more time to reflect, and sit back. I am often busy doing things, and dont spend the time to reflect.
