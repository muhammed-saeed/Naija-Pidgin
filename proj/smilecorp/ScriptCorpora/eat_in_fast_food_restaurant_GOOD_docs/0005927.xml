One-third of Central New York superintendents would take pay cuts if governor&apos;s salary cap proposal becomes law

 Follow 161 Tweet Share close Digg Stumble Upon Fark Reddit Share Email Print Gloria Wright / The Post-Standard Liverpool school superintendent Richard N. Johns would face a $5,000 pay cut if the bill becomes a law. &quot;It certainly looks like a political ploy to me,&quot; Johns said. &quot;Superintendents are an easy target. It&apos;s basically a distraction from the reality of the governor&apos;s proposed $1.5 billion cut in school aid.&quot; 
Syracuse, NY -- About one-third of school superintendents in Central New York could face pay cuts if Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s proposal to put a cap on their salaries becomes law.

Search consultants working to fill vacant superintendent positions in CNY also fear a cap could hinder their ability to attract quality candidates.

Cuomo introduced his bill last month to put a cap on the six-figure salaries based on the district’s student enrollment. Superintendents in school districts with less than 250 students could make up to of $125,000. For superintendents in the largest districts, with more than 6,501 students, the cap would be set at $175,000.

“It certainly looks like a political ploy to me,”said Liverpool Central School District Superintendent Richard N. Johns.“Superintendents are an easy target. It’s basically a distraction from the reality of the governor’s proposed $1.5 billion cut in school aid.”

Johns’salary would be reduced to $175,000 from $180,000 when his contract expires, if the cap is approved. The average superintendent salary is the state is $166,000. A year ago, the state average was $163,000, just over the national average of $160,000. The average salary in CNY is $143,404.

In CNY, 12 superintendents make more than the state average. Under the cap proposal, 37 percent of the superintendents would take a pay cut when their contracts come up for renewal, based on their current salaries.

Right now the proposal is under review in the Assembly, said Sisa Moyo, spokesperson for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. It’s not clear whether the bill would have support in the Assembly, but political experts expect it would have a hard time passing the Assembly.

The bill already has support from a number of members of the Senate Republicans, said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republican majority.

“We are interested in finding ways to help school districts control their own spending,”Reif said.“And with school aid cuts this year, we need to find ways to reduce spending and keep more resources in the classrooms.”

Cuomo’s proposal would cap the salaries of school superintendents to bring those salaries back in line with other senior public officials, according to the bill. The governor, for example, makes $179,000 a year, although Cuomo has agreed to a 5 percent pay cut to bring the salary to about $170,000.

Cuomo’s staff said the superintendents’salary cap would save taxpayers about $15 million.

Syracuse common councilors considered a proposed limit of $190,000 on the salary Syracuse City School District’s next superintendent. Councilor Ryan McMahon, a Republican, said a cap would be appropriate at time when the district is eliminating 450 positions.

On Monday, the council voted 6-3 against a local cap. The governor’s proposal would cap the Syracuse superintendent’s pay at $175,000.

John Bishop, an associate professor in human resource studies at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the $15 million in savings is too small and won’t make a difference compared to the governor’s proposed $133 billion budget. The savings from the cap is about .01 percent of the governor’s total budget proposal.

“Superintendent’s work is very difficult work and the cap won’t fix the financial problem the state is facing,”said Bishop, who is an expert in education research.“Lowering superintendent salaries won’t improve education, it’s merely a distraction.”

Robert Lowry, of the New York State Council of School Superintendents, also said the proposal is a distraction from Cuomo’s $1.5 billion cut to school aid.

“This is an attempt to create an argument over $15 million rather than have $1.5 billion school aid cut that he has purposed,”he said.“My interpretation of the cap is (Cuomo) would rather have the focus be on superintendent salaries than on what school districts will have to do with the deep cuts they are facing.”

Skaneateles Superintendent Philip D’Angelo makes $179,417 a year and would lose almost $24,000, the second largest drop in CNY, if the cap became a law. (The largest cut in salary, if the cap was approved, would be Jamesville-DeWitt’s Alice Kendrick, who would see her salary drop $27,000.)

“I’m frustrated,”D’Angelo said.“I have two master’s degrees and I’m working on my doctorate. I started teaching earning $17,000 a year. I’ve paid my dues.”

D’Angelo said being a superintendent is a 24/7 job and feels that it should be left to the boards of education to decide the pay for each superintendent.

Bill Speck, superintendent of Cayuga-Onondaga BOCES, agrees that decisions on the superintendents’pay should be left to school boards. And he fears that the cap could make filling vacancy more difficult.

Speck is currently leading a search for a superintendent in the Jordan-Elbridge school district. The school board has agreed on a salary range of $120,000 to $140,000, which is below the governor’s cap of $145,000 for the district that currently has 1,481 students enrolled.

“This is a specific salary range the community group and the board of education thought was appropriate for this time, place and location,”Speck said.“My belief is it should be the local board’s decision and authority to set salaries.”

Jessica Cohen, district superintendent and chief executive officer of the Onondaga-Cortland-Madison BOCES, is also leading searches in CNY and fears that a salary cap could hurt her ability to find qualified candidates.

Cohen said there has been a cap on BOCES superintendent salaries since 1993. The cap was originally set at $128,000 and adjusted five times in the past eight years. The cap is now at $166,572.

“I believe the salary cap will have and has had a tremendous effect on superintendent searches,”Cohen said. She said candidates have withdrawn from open BOCES superintendent seats because of the salary cap.

Cohen also agrees that the bill takes away local control from boards of education.

“In New York state, school boards, by law, make the decisions of who gets hired and what salaries and benefits are given to superintendents,”Cohen said.“What this legislation does is take away that local control.”

According to Cuomo’s bill, local control will be preserved. The bill would allow voters to override the cap if“the community believes it is in the best interest of the school district.”

DeAngelo made me laugh! Being a superintendent is a 24/7 job. REALLY...how do you find time to work on your doctorate AND be a superintendent ?

These clowns don&apos;t get it. A cap on their pay would be a start and then push down though the rest of the system. Yesterday someone posted that a shop teachers at CNS was making $94,000. Pure waste. So you want to put a &quot;doctor&quot; in front of your name. Good for you, but don&apos;t expect the rest of us to give you a bonus.

They absolutely do not get it. None of them can explain why they deserve to be paid as much or more than the Governor of New York State. With them it is tax and spend, just like the good okd days.
&quot;The best candidates&quot; are taxing people right out of their houses.
It is interesting that you mention CNS. After a 2 3/4 school tax hike last year, Melvin now wants a huge 5 3/4 tax hike. &quot;Do the math&quot;, Superintendent Melvin&quot;, home owners can&apos;t afford the explosion of taxes anymore. How about YOU do more with less?

A superintendent&apos;s salary should be the average of all the teachers in his or her district. That&apos;d lower the curve...

tonyb, do you have any proof? A name perhaps? If not, your comment has no merit behind it.

Yes. The statement “I have two master’s degrees and I’m working on my doctorate. I started teaching earning $17,000 a year. I’ve paid my dues.” illustrates a big part of the problem.

So just because you started your career at a lower pay somehow now you are entitled to something? Just because you went to school and earned degrees, the public owes you a certain amount of money? BS

This is the typical entitlement mentally for people on the public dime. I could have a PHD in my field and 25 years of experience, but unless I can turn that education and experience into something valuable to my organization my employer is not going to just keep raising my pay. Even with this, there are always limits. No fast food restaurant manager makes seven figures!

Oh, and last time I checked the product known as &quot;public education&quot; in New York was unbelievably expensive and lacking in quality.

Very well said fleethecity! The education doesn&apos;t entitle you to anything other than possibly being considered in the interview. What will get you a good paycheck you EARNED is a good school district that is that way through your own hard work.

Have not read all the posts but completely agree with this comment and those I have read. Waste, unfocused, inexcusable. Is there not just one county executive/supervisor. Se we really need a supervisor for each district? Does Skaneateles need a supervisor to over the entire empire of an elementary, middle and high school. Does anyone remember when consolidation was a topic that made sense? Both for schools, and the vast empire of village, town, city and county government? No wonder taxes are what they are. At what point will someone give up their kingdom and admit for the public good that things just have to change?

But nooo! Consolidation is the devils work! It&apos;s an evil trick devised by Liberals who want to create a new world order!

Fantastic posts on here. It&apos;s about time these real prizes had to do some good, and actually be accountable. Wisconsin has it right, and those out there that aren&apos;t doing a good job are really running scared now. They tout &quot;the law&quot; until it goes against their pocketbook, then they do things AGAINST the law. Hypocrites. Mouthy lying hypocrites. Now watch our locals threaten to cause havoc, because they are scared of the same thing here, too. If you aren&apos;t doing a good job, out you go. No tenure allowed. Lazy? out you go. Same as in the REAL world. Go ahead and leave if you&apos;re so upset, my gosh, look at the broken system you&apos;ve created here in the US. We can&apos;t WAIT for you to leave, if you won&apos;t do a good job teaching! Now we can&apos;t even compete with other countries because of this excuse for an education system. What are we ranked in math, science, tech, vs. other countries, like 1000th now?!?! Stop gossiping in your lunchrooms about who&apos;s having some affair with who, and start teaching! And all you good teachers.........THANK YOU. I KNOW you&apos;re out there, and we know you are as disgusted with these losers with their fangs in the system, both the fellow teachers AND the administrators.

&quot;Just Do it for the Children.&quot; The Education Biz has become a Scam. More and more money for poor results. We need competition school vouchers etc. It should be a profession that means more than an easy 9 month a year gig with an sweet early retirement.
