Which Of My Two Beginnings Do You Prefer?
Chapter 1

Maë’s Point Of View

I stood in a narrow hallway looking around,
I got the vague feeling that I recognised this place.
I looked to my right and saw an ornately carved door,
it was white, which stood out compared to the blood red walls.
I walked towards the door, as if it was calling to me.
And then I realised,
I was dreaming,
it hit me like a fist to the stomach,
I turned around expecting to see the same boy but he wasn’t there.
I turned back around and the door was gone,
I was inside the most gorgeous room I had ever seen.
The walls are a creamy-gold colour which went well with the white carpet.
He has a dark coloured oak bed with cream bedcovers
“you never know who’s going to come along” a voice from behind me stated.
I turned around in shock,
the boy, who’s bedroom I was in was stood behind me,
a smirk plastered on his face,
and Oh My God was he fit. He has short brown hair, that when straightened would go to just below his ears (like emo style), and grey eyes, like the colour of the sky just before a storm.
I could have easily got lost in his eyes if he hadn’t started laughing.
“ummm hi” I said, trying to regain my hurt pride.
“hi, so I see you’ve found your way to MY room” he replied the smirk still in place
“sorry, I was outside in the hallway and saw the door” I started to blabber on
“don’t worry about it, wanna see the rest of the house?”
I nodded slowly unsure of what to think with him around,
god if this is a dream he definitely makes it worthwhile I thought to myself.
We walked out of the door but without one quick glance back at the room.
The creamy-gold walls, white carpet, 102inch Samsung plasma TV, more DVD’s and CD’s then a fully stocked music shop (HMV or something like that). In the corner a small looking CD player with speakers all around the room to make it louder, then I was yanked out of the room.
We walked down the hallway silently until we got to a flight of stairs, they was made of concrete, we arrived at the floor below and carried on walking,
frames of people all along the corridor, some of the lad I was walking with.
We reached the main staircase at the top of the entrance way,
or should I say foyer?
It was massive with golden walls and white wood floor (they like the colours white and gold don’t they?)
I walked down the black marble staircase, I could imagine walking down here to go to a ball and everyone looking at me, it made me smile just thinking about it. We walked through to the living room, where the colour scheme changed to baby blue carpets and lemon coloured walls. The furniture is brown fabric material, the kind you can just sink into, and not have any problems with. Mounted on the wall was another plasma TV and a wall length window, that you could see out onto the massive front garden and city beyond that, just on the outskirts of the city I could see a battle just about to take place, I ran out of the room and down a narrow hall trying to get closer, when a stroke of lightening hit the wall in front of me,
I fell to the ground and scrunched in a tight ball, before losing consciousness.

What should I call this poem?
She got herself a glass of water and took a couple sips
Before setting it on the shelf
Then she settled in to watch TV with her happy family

They needed some ice cream
From the corner store
So her mammi and her pappi took her sister to the store
When they were gone this little girl fell asleep
Watching bugs bunny reruns with her fluffy tie-die slippers

The next morning she woke up
The house was quiet and still
Though she was scared she went about as normal
A slice of toast for breakfast
She dropped the butter
But there was no one there to hear it

A few days later she was still alone
When a knock on the door broke her silent frenzy
The police took her to the station
To identify the bodies

She looked at their empty eyes
And fixed the hair that was out of place
She tucked the sheets in around them
As they would have done for her
Upon her infant sister’s pale skin
Blood stained though it was
She placed a single chapped lip kiss
But did not feel a thing

When she was taken home
To collect her things
She picked up the stagnant glass from that night
But did not take a sip

If you visit the house now
Dusty dank and cobwebbed
You will see the mouldy spot and shattered glass
Upon the shelf

You tell a poignant tell well. This makes me feel such sadness for the child.

You have succeeded in making a reader feel, react, respond. No greater compliment belongs to a poet, for you truly are one.

I’d call it Sophie—it is the name that came to me as I read about the child. gg

frederm acne gel, what do u think of it?
i used it after seeing it on tv, was a little shocked at the £8 price tag tho.
i tried it and then i lost the tube,it did make my skin less spotty, im 25 and have had bad skin since i was about 11 and had allsorts of lotions and potions off my dr.
this cream is amazing, i used it for a few weeks before i missplaced the tube and now i use clean and clear spot reducing clensing lotion, i also dont use fsce make up any more just eye makeup and lip gloss and my skin still needs some work but is at the best it has ever been
if ur spotty as much as i was then this is the product for u and dont worry about the price, worth the money.

I haven’t used it before…I do these things:

Mix baking soda and witch hazel/or water together until it comes to a good constancy, and then spread on your face and leave it on for 10-15 minutes. these two things are very inexpensive and it’s very easy to do since there is only two ingredients.

Toothpaste is good for drying out your pimple (for some people). Put only a little bit before you go to sleep. Some people use this as a mask but DON‘T EVER DO THIS! It can change your skin tone and make your face discolored.

Aloe vera helps scars lighten and less noticeable (lemon, cocoa butter, witch hazel, and tea tree oil do the same thing). Use the gel (of the aloe plant) or the real thing.

Try to buy a cleanser that works for you, and when you wash your face, open your pores with hot water (not too hot, or it will dry out your skin) and massage it gently into your skin. Then, use cold water at the end to close you pores. The smaller your pores are, the less likely you’re prone to pimples. Clearasil, Neutrogena, and proactive are good choices to start if you want a cleanser. Don’t use body soaps because they dry out your skin. Don’t scrub too hard either, because it can irritate your skin.

An egg yoke can be used to make you pores smaller. I used this when I had pimples. Just take the egg yolk (the yellow part) and leave it on your face for 10-15 minutes and rinse off with warm water and then splash your face with cold water.

Keep your hair out of your face because the oils in your hair could go into your pores. Change you sheets because they’re are trapped with dirt, oils, etc.

Zinc (type of vitamin) is the one of the best things you can use to get rid of pimples. You can buy these almost about any large store (such as Wal-Mart or Shaws.) Have one tablet per day and try to cut down the junk food and replace it with vegetables and fruits. Drink lots of water and don’t pop you acne. Popping acne can lead to acne scars.

If you have sensitive skin, don’t use make up. Some of the things in make up can clog your pores and cause pimples.

Can you give opinions on my story?
“I can’t find the channel to CW.”Elisha told her friends in her father’s rented-out penthouse.“Can someone get the TV guide?”

Jen walked over to the wide-screened television and plucked the pamplet from behind it. Elisha and her friends had been in New York for nearly seven hours and they still hadn’t done anything. Elisha looked out the window, watching the heavy snow fall from the sky. The weather man said it would clear up in the next couple of hours, but she was ready to do some shopping. She didn’t want to escape Indiana for the next couple of days only to not do anything. She thrived on having fun.

“Ah!”Holly let out a deep sigh, tucking her long, dark-brown hair behind her ear.“Has anyone seen my earring? It fell off.”

Elisha gasped. Everyone knew that was a five hundred dollar earring Holly’s father had given her Christmas of 2007. If Holly were to lose it, she would be in serious trouble. Immediately everyone started looking in every nooks-and-crannies for Holly’s earring. Elisha and Reese took the the route to the bathroom where the inside of it was systmetatically clean. Reese let out a low whistle as she traced her manicured fingers on the ivory colored sink. Studio lights flickered on her face as she glared into the circular mirror. Elisha rolled her eyes, looking under the trash-bin.

Voila! Elisha thought to herself.

She picked the diamond studded earring off the floor. Feeling like a hero, she returned to Holly who was lounging on the expensive Italian leather couch.

“Here you go.”she grinned, handing her the stray earring.

“Shanks, babe!”Holly said breezily, reattaching the earring to her ear.“Now, let’s talk about our Christmas vacation. What are we going to get for each person.”
Elisha sat on the couch, crossing her pale legs. She had thought about it for a while. She had over twenty people to buy presents for. It was hard trying to think of the perfect present from her friends. She already knew what Holly wanted. The new perfume set that Hilary Duff was coming out with. And Andy and Reese both needed new athletic shoes. She had no idea what Savannah, Carter, Andy, Danielle, Maris, Courtney, Jen, Mark, and her other friends wanted. She had so many. Christmas shopping was going to be really hectic for her. Everyone would probably be rushing in the stores trying to find their friends and families the perfect gift. Mark was the main problem on her mind. Mark loved soccer, but he had every soccer thing that was ever invented. So did Andy. She was out of ideas for Mark. Strolling downtown was going to be her hobby for the next few days in New York.

“Guys, I’m leaving.”announced Savannah, putting on her cream trench coat.

“Where are you going?”Reese asked.

“Hanging out with Carter.”she answered, adjusting her ear muffs over her ears.“We’ll be back soon.”

“Beware of the cold!”called Maris, hanging upside down on the couch reading a Gossip Girl novel.

“Kay!”shouted Savannah, shutting the door behind her.

“Aren’t you hanging out with Mark?”asked Courtney, turning her attention to Elisha.

Elisha shrugged. She hadn’t talked to Mark since the other day. She kind of didn’t want to hang out with him right now because she needed time to think about what she was buying him for Christmas.

“Maybe.”she said nonchalantly, plopping on the love seat next to Palma.

“Well, I’m gonna see John in a minute.”applied Reese, brushing her long blond hair in the Victorian mirror.

“Why is everyone going out?”asked Courtney.“I swear, I’m the only girl who doesn’t have a boyfriend.”

“What about me?”Danielle asked, placing her hands on her hips.“If you’re talking about me dating that foreign guy, it was only for two weeks. That hardly justifies as a relationship.”

“Whatever. You’re right.”Courtney said with the wave of her hand.“I can just flirt with some New Yorker boy.”

Elisha liked Courtney’s idea. Courtney was the wildest girl in the bunch. Every boy that met her always fell for her. She had this charm that every boy liked. No boy can resist Courtney Hoftstadter.

“I’m going to meet Andy now.”Palma said for Courtney’s benefit.“See ya!”

They all laughed as Courtney shot her a look of death. Palma just shrugged and strided out of the apartment door. Elisha leaned back in her seat, taking a sip from her hot chocolate in her custom made mug. The hot sensation sizzled down her throat as she engulfed her tongue with the chocolate goodness of the drink.

Just then Mark entered the room with a coat on. He made his way in as everyone took a look at him. He seemed to have been in a chipper mood. Elisha loved it when Mark wa

Ten worst gifts to buy a woman?
1. Never give a woman any kind of household appliance or something that is going to make“housework”easier. For instance, a blender, a toaster, a new vacuum, one of those mops they advertise on tv that does everything but suck the life out of you, anything in a informercial. The only wise choice is a new washing machine with a turbo spin cycle. (Makes laundry day go by pretty fast when you can at least sit on it during spin-dry and end up smiling the rest of the day.)

2. Any bulk cleaning supplies,“honey, I got you that large box of Tide you have been wanting.”“This Windex should last you a while.”“I got a good deal on the industrial strength toilet bowl cleaner.”All I can say is, be prepared to run. I have faith that if you would have at least stopped and thought about what would be a much more intimate gift, you would have had the sense to spring for the $5 Chia Pet you were eyeing in Kmart.

3. Any sharp objects made by Ronco which slices or dices, or a set of ginsu knives. These may one day be used as a weapon against you when you come home with lipstick on your collar after a“night out with the boys.”

4. Do not buy gifts for yourself and pretend they are for her.“Honey, I’m sure you’ll get a lot of use out of the new drill I bought you.”By then she will have put it to good use by drilling a quarter inch hole into the side of your skull for even thinking she would accept such a lame gift. After a gift like this, you probably won’t be around for NEXT Christmas.

5. Any lingerie made of flannel, such as a pair of feet pajamas with a trap door in back. A Little Mermaid or Barney cartoon character nightgown. It gives her the idea that you do not consider her the sexy woman that she is. Take out that wallet and buy her something sexy from Victoria Secret (just like you did for your mistress or other girlfriend).

6. No name perfume which costs you $1.99, such as Eu de Toilet, which actually smells like the bathroom, moldy fruit, or your dirty socks. If you are going to buy her perfume, spring for the brand names.

7. Any type of cubic zirconia jewelry you see on the Home Shopping Network. It will be quite embarrassing when she is showing off that fabulous diamond to her friends and tries to cut glass with it. (We actually test them you know.) Also, now would not be a good time to buy her that set of diamond nipple clamps you always wanted to, you know how we like to show off our jewelry and it could get embarrassing at the New Year’s party when she decides to show them off to your buddies.

8. Please do not buy her clothes because you think for one minute you have good taste in woman’s clothing. Well, perhaps you might if you are a transvestite, but all in all, believe me, she’ll smile and say its beautiful while choking back tears and mumbling under her breath,“were the hell would I ever wear this outfit without being arrested for bad taste?”An additional hint, plaids do not go with stripes (even though you think your golfing outfit looks just fine). Its a known fact to the rest of the world that that is a taboo. In the Northeast, thats like wearing white after Labor Day.

9. Do not give her a gift certificate to Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers. Most men would know better, especially the ones who have learned the correct response to“do these pants make me look fat.”If you are one of the poor souls who still doesn’t get it and purchased a gift like this, be prepared for the silent treatment for a month. (Although that may be something you would actually look forward to.) A better alternative would be hiring a Chippendale dancer as a personal trainer to get her motivated into getting fit.

10. Last but not least, never buy a woman anti-wrinkle cream, or a book on“How not to be Nasty Sunday through Saturday.”These are not considered gifts, they are considered reasons for seriously injuring the person who bought it and just may stand up in court of law.

Dear Skyler,

I don’t really know how to tell you this, but your nostrils are insulting. I think I realized it when you smacked my butt at the mental hospital and I saw you pour syrup on my father. I’m sure you’re open enough to understand that we’re related. I’m returning your Hannah Montanna underwear and bra to you, but I’ll keep your glass eye as a memory. You should also know that I confessed today about the moose poaching and you should get that embarrassing rash checked .

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t see any way possible to overcome this..Super long?
I’ve been so, so sad for as long as I remember. Yes, we all have our happy times here and there, but not one thing has in my life. Not family, not love, not trust, nothing. I’m only 16 years old and I wish I was never born. I was beaten, molested, etc. by my step dad for 10 years, starting when I was 3 years old. I never said anything to my mom until I was 10 because and this is sickening, it’s all I never knew. I thought it was normal for step fathers to do that. I learned later it wasn’t, but then I saw something on the tv like a CSI show where the step dad killed the mother because the little girl told so I suffered just to keep my mom alive because I actually thought he would because my step dad was so violent to me. But you can only hold on so long when you’re little and EVERY day is hell to you, so I told her when I was 10. She didn’t believe me, but asked my step dad. Of course he denied everything, but beat me. Oh god did he beat me I didn’t want to eat for days because it just hurt so bad to do anything, but lay on the ground. My mom did nothing to help me. Did not once come check on me in my room and completely ignored the fact that I just told her my own step father had abused me for 10 years and just went about life like nothing happened.. I told her when he was away and she promised he would never do it again, lie. Maybe it’s just me, but if I ever had a daughter just seeing that fear of my life in her eyes as she can’t even breath by trying to tell you about him, I couldn’t handle myself. Since that every day, I have no trusted a single person. I swear I can remember that like it was earlier today. Anyway, yeah he beat me and just started beating me more often along with molesting just as much. Every day, god it was horrible, omg you just don’t know. I don’t even know how I make it now, he’s gone, but I don’t know how I make it. Why can’t I just go to sleep and not wake up? He finally went away when I was 13, but not because I told her again, because she got a hold of my diaries and I just blew up that day. I couldn’t take one more day, I just couldn’t. He was a police officer (how ironic, supposed to be protecting people and all) and tried to shoot me so I didn’t really have a choice, but to run into the woods. So she kicked him out that day. I guess it takes your own husband to try and shoot your daughter to finally make you do something. They’re still married and she still goes on“work trips”to see him. She never had a single work trip until he moved out. Well I was finally getting to be okay even if my own mom stayed with that monster, until I found out my entire family knew the entire time. My dad, he was my BEST friend, I thought if he knew, he would do ANYTHING to help me because I would do the same thing. I didn’t eat for days, I honestly thought I was going to die from a broken heart at times it felt like my very heart was just ripping apart. I found out at one of my brothers baseball games, we were on the UF campus and it was really hot outside, I was fighting with my mom and my step dad came up in the arguement, no surpsrise there and I asked my dad…have you really known? He couldn’t even look back at me. The one single person I thought who honesty might have loved me, lied to me and did nothing to protect me. We used to go get ice cream and just hang out, he was basically my only friend because I always had such a hard time trusting and wanting to get close to other kids, but that day, that very moment changed EVERYTHING. He even asked me, why don’t we hang out as much as we used to, as if he really doesn’t know. He recently got in a motorcycle accident and broke his neck, my mom called and told me and I didn’t even feel a thing. I felt no remorse or regret for words said, I didn’t even care if he had died. I just think when I found out he knew, if I had any love at all, was ripped away from me in that very second I found out. Now here I am, with not even two friends in high school. One is moving to Alabama so pretty soon I’ll only have one and this is her senior year and I’ll have no one my senior year. I live in a small town and you’re pretty much stuck with whoever you chose in elementary school. I get wierd faces because the town found out I wanted to kill myself, thanks mom. No one wants to be my friend. I honestly feel at this point, I will never make friends. The senior friend is my best friend and I know we’ll still be friends when she’s in college, but still she’ll be 2 hours away. I recently just went to drivers ed, it wasn’t that hard to talk to people because I didn’t know anyone, but no one really seemed like me. They were so mean in there, just sitting there watching them it was quite unbelievable how they must be so mean to people they don’t even know. Me personally, I never judge people by just what they’re weari
Well yeah people who know my story don’t even know how I can possibly handle it, but you know it’s no where near as hard they think. They wouldn’t even be able to imagine it. Yeah I can sometimes overcome something that happened that day, but guess what? There’s a brand new challenge right after that one. At this point it’s just like…I’m so tired of trying to find someone..I feel as if I’m suffacating my best friend and I know that’s not good for any friendship, but I need her so bad. I need someone just one person on this earth who I know will take the time to listen to me, but she’ll be leaving in a year and then what? I”m so scared because if it’s already close to rock bottom now, what the hell am I going to do when she leaves? I won’t have a single person. I’ll be stuck in this house alone with all of these haunting past memories and no one to just be in company with to let me know I’m not alone. Come senior year, life is going to be horrible
What can they really do? I wanted to go to authorities when I was little and learned that you could do that, but then I thought, what can they really do? Take me away from everything I’ve ever know and probably put me with someone who probably won’t like me either. Besides, my family told everyone I lied about the whole thing because I was“mad about my parents divorcing”and the police would have never believed me if my entire family was sticking to the same story. I wish I was never born, my family is horrible. Just because I was the first to have something happen to me, doesn’t mean I’m strange. You can’t expect me to be given that kind of life and come out normal.
But it’s like yeah I know I’m still alive, but what does that matter when everyday you hate yourself? When it’s like everyday you see no hope for the future, no innocence, and absolutely no love from anyone,but the single friend you have which btw isn’t even your family. It’s just like I’m going through the motions, I’m just a lifeless body going to school and coming back.
I have wanted to kill myself, I still do every day. I actually dream about ways that I kill myself. But you know I’ve been raised in this so called‘christian’household and I know how the religion is and if you aren’t christian then you’re bound to this horrible place called hell for eternity. I mean I really don’t understand it, I really don’t. It feels as if I’m the only person who has logically thought this through. If I truly loved someone, I wouldn’t even draw them into existence in the first place, they would never even have to suffer. The bible pretty much completely contradicts itself and this god person doesn’t seem as loving when you really look at the big picture. life is hell! UGH I’m so tired of suffering how can even without a single normal relationship if my own damn mother or father dislikes me???

My goodness girl–how have U survived. UR a very strong young lady which will be to UR benefit as U mature. I wish I could just grab U and HUG U my wee one, as I can’t believe U have survived all of this. I don’t understand why U never went to the authorities? Even though U live in a small town, U have a phone, U have the internet, U can get help. Take this advise and follow through. I don’t know what else to tell U my child, but U must protect UR self and it looks as though U need this protection from UR own mother. I sincerely wish I could offer more to U, but I am just dumbfounded. I wish U all the success that life can bring to U&amp;filled with much happier days in the future. Now take care of UR self and get in touch with the authorities.

Since it’s human nature to resist and detest oppression and enslavement, do blacks have a right to hate whites?
I’m not looking to fire the furnace, but I know that’s going to happen anyway. Let me state my case, and then you may take it where you want to. Slaves always revolt because it is an unnatural state for human beings. A POW camp will always have those who would rather die than be held captive. Blacks may not be working in cotton fields anymore, but the social constructs and conditioning in the USA mimic the chains of slavery. For example, everyday we turn on TV, here is a blond haired, blue eyed white chick telling us about what hair cream makes the hair beautiful. What kind of hair? White folks hair of course, and the cream doesn’t do anything but tangle up black hair. Up until“Princess and the Frog”, there were no major children’s movies featuring a black girl as the beautiful princess. The black girl was the maid, the servant the jolly cook. Even in“Princess and the Frog”Tiana was a cook with dreams of a typically“black”role in white movies, cooking for white folk.

Many of us don’t know our family history, because that has been taken from us. That is another form of oppression because we don’t know who our people are and where our true roots lie. That’s why you see so many blacks on this Erykah Badu shizz and joining racist groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites, because they are searching for something to identify themselves as. It’s hard to be a lost people being force-fed a steady diet of white is right propaganda and smile-in-your-face racism and discrimination. It’s everywhere, so no need to deny it. I’m a frail, small framed woman, and white women look at me when I am out running as if I am a criminal out to mug them. Most of them are big enough to sit on me and whip my butt, if they only knew, but that’s beside the point.

If you had to deal with this mess day by day, and your people had this legacy from whites, who could blame a black person for hating them, right? I’m not saying *I* do, I’m just saying.
No need to get mad white people it’s a valid question. You can simmer down, it’s not like my query is going to take your white privilege away from you. LOL! Ha ha ha.

what do you think of my story so far ?
Avery watched on as he swung once more, aiming for the face, she cringed inside upset with herself for not getting up and pushing him out of the way, next time she whispered quietly to herself, next time it would be different. She closed her eyes and pictured herself 5 years ago, sitting on the wooden counter top, next to the worn out cutlery and the creaky cupboards, in the 2 bedroom house she lived in, talking to her brother Alex about the surprise he had for her. It was one of her fondest memories, when Alex had taken her out to the town carnival, they’d bought candyfloss and rode on all the rides. She had wondered why Alex was being nice that day, not that he wasn’t nice normally, it was just that he was being extra nice. Avery remembered his voice when he’d tucked her into bed that night, he sounded tired and full of regret, he was only 4 years older than her making him 13 at the time, but it seemed as if he carried too much weight on his shoulders for a 13 year old.‘Remember im always going to be here for you, ill never leave you .. not really.’The last words he’d ever said to her. He’d lied, he said he would never leave but when she woke up 9 hours later, she found his keyring the one of his initials A.H on her bedside table and a note beneath it. She opened the note and read the simple words written in capitals, her english wasn’t very good as she’d never been sent to school, Even now 5 years later she still remembered what the letter said,‘im sorry, i cant do this no more, take care of Mom, i love you.’such simple words, yet they left a hole in heart and an emptiness inside of her, even today.
Her mind was pulled back to the present, when she heard sirens outside her house and men shouting saying there coming in. Avery looked around at her Dad curled up in the corner by the rocking chair, he mimicked it rocking back and forth, she wanted to laugh at how funny he looked, but knew it was nor the time nor place, she turned her head around to look through the hallway and saw men breaking down the door, police officers and paramedics. In the corner of her eye near the old cupboard which held the old 70′s tv, she saw a red carpet, only when bought it wasnt red she remembered it being a cream colour she favoured alot. A split second after seeing the now red carpet, she heard a gut-wrenching scream she would never forget, and put her hand against her mouth to stop herself from screaming anymore, it was useless, choked sobs came after and escaped through her hand covering her mouth. She heard a mans voice, and felt someone rub her shoulder, trying to give her abit of support, but she shrugged him of. Her eyes started to burn because of the constant tears falling from them. The man who was rubbing her shoulder only a second before was talking to her now, yet she wasnt registering a wordof what he was saying, she heard glimpses of‘He was a bad man’&amp;‘Its guna be okay’The cop was wrong about both things, he wasnt a bad man he was a disgusting,foul man who deserved a worse punishment than death, and no nothing was going to be okay, because all she could see now, was the woman she was supposed to take care of, the woman who she’d promised her self to make sure was okay, dead on the floor. She’d failed. Everyone left her, her brother had left, her dad no doubt would go to a prison now, and her mom was lying breathless on the floor. Dead.

Please read this and give me feed back,?
Chapter one
I finished the last of the vanilla ice cream, and I turned off the TV. This afternoon at the beach my boyfriend for 2 years broke up with me because he met someone else. I loved him since Middle school. And he broke my heart by text and I have been watching romantic movies ( like that would help) and eating ice cream the whole day. There was a bunch of tissues on my bedroom couch from all my crying.

My ex-boyfriend has short black hair with brown eyes and is 5’6 and 2 cm

My name is Alexis Shield and I’m a freshmen at Lesley park high school. I have light blue eyes with brown wavy hair with side bangs, I’m 5’5, and I just started high school 3 weeks ago. Thinking it would be the best possible. I have a lot of friends and I passed two test with flying colours but my boyfriend broke up with me and I thought this was only the beginning.

The next morning I got on my school bus and sat next to my best friend Lily. Lily has straight dirty blond hair and one strick of hair is always a different colour today was yellow. She is 5’6 with hazel eyes.

”I heard the news.”Revealed Lily.

“Already?”I asked.

”Yeah I’m sorry that Blake broke up with you I heard he is going out with Olivia now.”She mentioned

”I should have known.”I hissed.

Just the other day Olivia Dryden went up to Blake and started to flirt with him. But me not being a person who needs to know what her boyfriend is doing every second wasn’t scared of him going out with her because I didn’t think he would. Olivia hated me and I hated her every since 5th grade when she kissed my crush on the lips and I swore revenge and I got it one day in 6th grade Olivia started liking a guy named brad and I dated him for all of 6th grade but then came a long handsome Blake and he ask me out so I answered yes I mean who wouldn’t say yes to his gorgeous brown eyes, but anyways Olivia and I had been fighting dirty all these years and Olivia always gets the upper hand she is the most popular girl in the grade and every guy is always drooling over her but she consistently harasses other girls, just so she can feel good That’s high school who would have known?

The bus arrived and I ran off to meet up with Abigail. Abigail has red curly shoulder length hair with blue eyes like me and is about 5’2 she is the smallest in the class but she doesn’t really care.

“ Hey Abby I heard you need tutoring in science .” I assumed

“ Wow news travels fast in this school.” She advised

“ Yeah trust me I know.” I chuckled.

“ But yep I need a torture.” Abby Admitted

“ Well I could be your tutor Science has been my best subject since first grade and last year I got all A+ through each semester.” I bragged

“ That’s great! It’d be better to have a friend as a tutor than some random person.” She Implied

“ I assume that’s a yes I’ll meet you at the library tonight a 6.” I insisted.

As I walked in the school hallway over to my locker to get my books. I heard whispering and snickering about “ Alexis this Alexis that.” I started to get annoyed and tried to ignore it but what made it worse was when I passed by Olivia’s locker and saw Blake and Olivia talking and giving romantic looks. When Olivia saw me she glanced over and gave me a dirty look. I knew Olivia was only doing this to make me mad and sad at the same time and it was working but even I wouldn’t steal someone’s boyfriend even if I did hated them for over 4 years. That would be rude and horrible to someone who had a two year relationship. But obviously Blake couldn’t see through those fire flaming eyes. Olivia has straight strawberry blond hair with layers and forehead bangs she has natural light blond highlights. She had brown eyes and is about 2 cm taller than me.

When the bell rang for every one to get to class I was the last to get in. I wanted to avoid “ The Rush.”
I slid into my seat to find a note attached to my desk writing this:

Dear Alexis

Are you happy to see how great a couple me and Blake are! You were a great couple too when he was your boyfriend but we make a better couple! So how is your sucky life going huh? I am I making it miserable ?
Well at least you still have your dignity. But remember your never going to make it far in life with me around.

P.S feel under your desk.

From: Olivia

Olivia threatens me and harasses me but I’m not scared of her so she took my boyfriend away but I don’t need a boy to complete my life. I felt under my desk to find my hand stuck to Olivia’s gum. What a pleasant surprise I jerked my hand and shook the desk a little and got my hand off of her gum. When a small note fell on the floor. I picked it up with my gummy hand thinking it would still be from Olivia but it wrote something more friendly:

Dear: Alexis

I Admire you so much so I wrote you a poem:

Roses are beautiful
And so are you

Mountains are magnificent
And so are you

Nature is the world
And my world is you

On the Verge of an Angel, Devil, Or Mortal

I was sprawled on the cream colored leather couch, inspecting my glistening black satin colored nails. I lay upside down and glued my eyes toward the blank plasma TV screen that stuck to the wall panel facing me. I didn’t feel like graduating today. No more friends, no more fun or good times. After today and on, I’ll have to go to some dumb country down below the ground of clouds. I’ll have to watch over the country, grant human’s wishes if they deserve it, make sure if they’re doing some good or bad for the entire planet, blah blah blah, but no more heaven, tommorow I will be an official Angel. I didn’t want my angel-in-training life to end. Plus, I didn’t want to give up my room. I was so used to living in this apartment.You see, useless humans, that they are little rooms for the students of the school so they can live, and if we’re leaving, the building’s new rooms belong to new newbie angels.
After a moment of silence and thought, I quickly finnished my cherry custard tart, and got dressed and ready for the last day of school.
Angels must be so relieved they’re leaving here. One, I’m leaving, and they’re so scared of me, and I don’t know if it’s my devious looks or whatever. Two, they’ll be departing from the building you call a school….

I burst through the doors of the Graceful Wings school. Dumb name, right? The students
checked out my partly gothic outfit, nodding approvingly but a scared expression was spead across their delicate faces. I had a reputation here and angels always thought I would turn out to be a devil.
I flew swiftly, kind of embarrassed, toward my friend,Chelsea’s, locker. “Hey,” I spoke with a gleeful tone, hiding the sad one.
“Hey, what’s up?” she replied, smacked her colorful locker shut. Without a word, she dropped her textbooks in my hands and started to apply ballerina cherry lipgloss on her tight lips, without letting me answer. I cringed, but not in fear, how could she wear such girly stuff? But I guess opposites attract…“ So what country are you going to after graduation?” she questioned out of nowhere. I winced, the question I despised. I had no idea what country to go to. Half my friends want to go to France, US, and Spain.I shrugged and handed her books back in one quick motion.
“See you later,” I mumbled as I flew with speed, while dodging careless flyers, toward room A16, whooppeee my favorite class to begin with….. the Use of Powers class, before that tiring late bell rang.

Chelsea and Dana, my other friend came over my house, I mean apartment, after school. Dana is not as drool worthy (or drop dead gorgeous) as Chelsea but she’s hilarious and has a bubbly personality. So anyway they came over my house and we did eachother’s hair, makeup, and all that beautifying stuff. We were getting dolled up for our graduation. I hated every look they tried on me but it kinda worked out. I tried to make our fun last for this night so I started a heavenly well known fight, Angel Dust Fight, where we fling angel dust at eachother, to see who looks most like a monster, but for our version, whoever loses and is covered up the most, buys us dinner..

The shining moon had risen and was full against the navy sky. I could feel it barely touching my pale skin. I was wearing a black sleevless, knee low dress that fanned out at the bottom and had a thick midnight black sash around my waist, with red gloves, and red flats, and dark makeup. Chelsea complimented me saying I looked nice but I knew she just envied the dress. I tugged my curled black hair and bit my deep red lips. I was nervous. I felt like mini angels were flying in my stomach. I gazed at them at the corner of my eye. Chelsea had her strawberry wispy blonde hair straightened till it fell a couple inches above her hips. She placed little flowers on her halo. She wore a white silky dress with spagghetti straps holding her ruffled dress. The angelic dress had sparkles all over it. She flew with gleaming white high heels. Her makeup was perfect in every way, medium pink colors on her cheeks, lips, and the mascara was just right.
Dana on the other hand, made her shoulder length brown straight hair wavy and wore a pink satin sleevless dress that was ruched beneath her hips. Dana wore a hibacus flower in her hair, and a sterling silver necklace with an angel on it. She didn’t believe in wearing makeup.

I was the bravest one to step forward and open the school door. “After you…” I murmmured to my soon-to-be-gone friends. They showered my we quiet thanks. It felt awkward. As I stepped in, a dark shadow loomed ahead. Professor Tedesca stopped me. Dana and Chelsea sneakingly slipped away from the Professor’s evil clutches. I gave a big sigh. Nothing worse than being stopped by a teacher, who’s hobby is lecturing, and having no friends to be there and witness it w

Can dogs sense spirits, demons or ghosts?
I am wondering if I have a spirit, possibly a demon, haunting me, I guess you could say. And it’s brought to my attention by my dog, who is a very intelligent dog and sometimes I swear I can have a conversation w/ her just by her facial expressions and the way she acts. There have been 2 significant times she has acted so weird it’s freaked me out to the point of hysteria and crying.
First experience was about 6 months ago, it was a Sunday I remember b/c I went to church that morning and our pastor preached a sermon on a possessed man that went up to Jesus in a church and Jesus cast the demon out of him. That definitely didn’t help the way my dog acted. I was sitting in a chair in my room watching TV when my dog“Rocko”started whimpering kind of. So I got up and walked over to her bed (which is at the foot of my bed) and started petting her saying“what’s wrong baby?”But she wouldn’t look at me, she was looking around me and past me. She was staring at something above my head and then her eyes would dart to the side of my head as if she were looking past me. While doing this she would alternate between whimpering and then wagging her tail like she was seeing something she liked. I kept calling her name but she WOULD NOT look at me. I thought maybe there was a bug or a shadow she was looking at so I moved to a different area of the room…. she followed me every place in the room I went and continued the same behavior. I went and got my roommate and said,“come here and see if the dog is acting weird to you”When he walked in the room she ran up to him wagging her tail and panting, like there wasn’t a thing wrong. But as soon as he left the room, she started looking around me again.
My second experience was last night and this scared me more than the first. Rocko came into my room and stopped at the end of my bed and looked at me for a minute, then jumped up on my bed like something was wrong, she had a scared look on her face. I said“No Rocko, down”(She’s not allowed up there b/c I just bought an expensive cream colored comforter) so she jumped down quickly onto her bed and was sitting leaned up against the wall. I can’t stand telling her no about anything so I got down on her bed and started petting her. She started frantically licking my face, then she started leaning away from me as I was petting her, like she was trying to get away. She then bit onto my hand so I thought she wanted to play, we rough house w/ her and she loves it, when she plays she’ll barely clamp down on your hand or arm and then let up. Well she was not playing. She was growling and gnarling her teeth at me and was actually biting me, HARD. I still kind of disregarded it and so when we’ve had enough of playing w/ her we’ll go“shhh”and rub her side or belly and she gets the hint that it’s time to settle down and she’ll stop. Well last night b/c she was biting me so hard I started doing that but she kept gnarling her lip w/ a low growl and would try to get to my hand or arm to bite it. So I sat up on the foot of my bed and she had this look I’ve never seen before, like I was a threat to her or something. She literally got up growling and jumped at me and bit my arm. I yelled“NO Rocko what is your problem ?!?”She immediately sulked back down in her bed and began cowering like she was scared, but she wasn’t cowering from me, she was looking past me again. I called her name over and over and she her eyes never moved, she was looking at something behind me and I could tell by her mannerisms she was scared. By this time I was starting to get freaked out b/c she was doing what she had done the first time. So I scooted further back on my bed and she stayed in hers for a few more minutes and then all of a sudden jumped up, walked to the side of my bed and gave me that“Follow me”look she gives when she either wants to go outside or wants a treat (I’ve spoiled her to death w/ treats). So I got up and said“what is it rock?”She started to walk and every few steps she would turn and make sure I was still behind her. She walked right past the door, didn’t need to go out, right past where I keep her treats, which is VERY strange, and walked into our living room or den area and stopped. She began staring over towards one area of the room, she was sniffing the air and her ears kept perking up. She began circling me, rubbing against my legs so hard she was knocking me backwards. Ok, I was definitely spooked by this time and so I looked at Rocko and said,“C’mon let’s go back to the room”and usually she’ll follow me, but she didn’t this time. I walked until I got out of her sight and stopped, I wanted to see what she was going to do next, so I peeked my head around the corner and she was up on the coach sitting at attention like in a guard dog manner. She was just staring either at me, or in my general direction. I walked on back to the room and tried to shake it off but I can’t. I’ve heard of dogs being able to sense spirits and things we can’t. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? Please, somebody, let me know I’m not going crazy!

I think your dog is seeing a demon near to you and that is why he is acting so bizarre. Therefore I suggest that you pray and ask Jesus Christ to protect you and your family and ask him for help. By praying I mean simply going somewhere privately and just talk to God (like you would a normal person) and ask him to protect you and your family and to explain clearly why this is happening to you.Then if your dog start acting strange again immediately command the demon to leave you and your house alone in the name of Jesus Christ. By commanding them I mean telling them forcefully as if you could see them (like you would a human being) to leave you and your house alone, using the name of Jesus Christ. If you are still having problems ask a pastor to bless your house, to pray for the safety of you and your family and to give you advice on the matter.

This dream was so real, I believed it. But it’s not.?
I had a dream and it was really vivid. One quick detail before I write; I am not adopted.
I was sitting in what seemed like a living room and all I could see was a cream-coloured couch and a lady with a black skirt sitting on it (Well, actually, all I could see was the tip of her black business-like skirt while her right leg was crossed and she had black high heels while she used her hands to gesture..) and a young couple on a brown couch nodding and saying something at times. The room was bright, filled with early morning sunshine and the walls were cream coloured. There were pictures hanging on the wall behind the the couple’s couch, a tall black lamp with a white shade on the fall wall that I was able to see as well as a bookshelf with light brown wood which was large enough to put a TV in it. I was sitting facing the far wall from the other side of the room, on a rocking chair. The lady put a few papers down on a dark cherry wood and glass coffee table and she seemed like she was done talking. (I wasn’t listening to the conversation…besides, I couldn’t even if I wanted to! I couldn’t hear any sound at that point.)
The couple smiled and looked at me. At that point I coud tell that they were Japanese.The lady in the black business skirt said something (voice was muffled) to me and the man stood up and walked over to me. He seemed extremely happy. I could see that he had brown-coloured rims on his glasses, brown eyes, black/brown hair that kind of hit the middle of his neck, a random fly-away hair in the back of his head and a kind smile. He bent over and said,“Get on.”(In English) and I got onto his back, since he was giving me a piggy back ride. He was wearing a brown long sleeved sweater and jeans. Behind the wall (which is behind the brown couch) was a hallway that led to a very nice kitchen with stainless steel pots and pans hanging on the ceiling and in between white banister and the wall was a staircase leading upstairs. He carried me up the stairs (at that point, I was worried that I was too heavy for him to carry me) and hit his head at the top of the stairs on what I think was a door frame. Automatically, I said (please excuse this probably fail grammar and wording. It was in the dream .)“Daijoubo desu ka, sensei?”He laughed and continued on. I sounded like myself for once, which was odd. Once we were inside of the place we were headed, another woman, not as old as the woman with the man, came in and greeted me. (no audio) I saw a large, dark wood window/door heading out to a white patio balcony thing and a peach tree behind that with entirely green leaves. The bright early morning sun was dimmed through cream coloured curtains that covered the window/door thing. There was a rug with red, yellow and green on it and on top of that was a small, dark, cherry wood round table with a vase with some sort of yellow flowers in it and there were all sorts of yellow and white plastic bags on the table. The woman(2) sat at a chair, which matched the table, and I sat down in a chair that had a checkered blue, green and white cushion on it. The woman who was with the man stood next to the woman who was sitting and I was looking at them. I could feel that I was smiling happily. The man said something (no audio) and I turned around and saw him holding a yellow bag to me. I took it and looked inside. It had a nice, light blue cell phone inside of it. It was like a cordless house phone and it was about 4 1/2 inches tall.(about 11.43 centimeters…I think) I said,“You didn’t have to get me anything,”because, it seemed like they were waiting for my arrival. The younger woman called the phone and I picked it up. She was talking in Japanese, but there was a male voice that sounded like a recording talking over her. Maybe it was a setup system or something, but I wasn’t really sure what it was. My conscious self didn’t know what she was saying, but my dream self understood her. I was very happy, but then I accidentally hit the end call button, but she didn’t notice. I could hear her better without the male voice, though. She finished speaking and I could see the whole family smiling. Of course, I had to show here that I accidentally hit the end call button and she just laughed. The man handed me the bag again and I saw my own toothbrush and tooth paste. When I went to grab the bag, I saw a blue, Transformers bag and I laughed. Then, I said,“Arigatou gozaimasu.”Then, the dream ended.
–
I really want to know why I dreamed this or what it means.
Any ideas?

PLEASE READ…What do you think?
Recently my best friend for many years and I got in an argument. I started yelling and he said“Don’t talk to me like you talk to your mom”then he also said“I don’t think we’re best friends anymore, we’re growing apart”It killed me, Imagine your BEST FRIEND telling you this, anyway I sent him this email today, what do you think…

My shoulders hold the pressure like the bottom of the ocean, it weighs too much on my emotion, It’s like I’m paralyzed, I don’t want to move I’m hypnotized, I try to fight it but it pushes and squeezes tears out of my eyes, I just hide it no one knows, sees or could realize, I’m sick of everybody and every thing, don’t want to think about what tomorrow will bring, cause it’ll just be more bullshit, 14 years now my moms been sick, there’s strains on every one of my relationships, so now where does this lead me, to my best friend tells me were not best friends anymore it kills me inside believe me, before you judge me please hear me out, I hold this shit in but now the truth I shall shout, I am not perfect there is no doubt, sometimes I speak harshly even to my own mom, It is something that I am not fond, but you must understand we have a bond, so what you see and hear it goes far beyond, for we hold an ocean you just see a pond, Imagine your mom waking you up at 4 in the morning hardly breathing, gasping and wheezing, my heart starts pounding, but I have to stay calm, if my composure dies then so does my mom, cause you see the more relaxed she is, the easier to breathe, inside i’m scared to death with shakin knees, But on the outside I’m collected so that’s what she sees, outside is calm, place her hand in my palm, inside I’m thinkin where the hell is the ambulance, holding the panic in is like stopping an avalanche, I wish you could have been there with me at least one of those nights, helplessly watching as my mom struggles and fights, just for air, it’s just not fair, within a year my parents got divorced, my dad moved away, my brother went into the Navy, me and my mom stayed, then she got sick, and I got scared, it happened so quick, my life started to end then and there, what once was an average family of four, became just me and her bedridden and poor, from gt’s and tv’s, to foodstamps and welfare, from Ice cream and popsicles, to regular ambulance rides to hospitals, from glad with mom and dad, to home and all alone, It finally got so bad, we were not gonna make it, we had to move close to family, we just couldn’t take it, so we sold our car, packed a uhaul and hit the road, Imagine moving across the country at only 16 years old, my friends and I huddled and cried, that day another small part of me died, music was what got me through the dark nights, someone stole my whole book of cd’s out of the cab of the uhaul that night, the bad thing is that it was one of my“friends”, what a goodbye, way to make amends, homeless and broke, friendless no joke, not even music to help me cope, but I did have my mom, a radio and the open road, a truck and us two bearing a heavy load, we had to use most of the money to get a room in Flagstaff,’cause her asthma acted up that fast, she barely got through it and we were ok, then we got a flat tire the very next day, staying at random relatives houses on the way, we were gonna make it no matter what you do or say, we arrived in Indiana December 2007, the groud blanketed with snow it looked like heaven, we stayed at relatives houses’til we got on our feet, I started a new school alone consumed with defeat, I went to a school where no one knew me, everyone seemed to look right through me, then I finally met a good group of friends, they helped more then they’ll ever know in the end, helped to ease some of the depression, it meant the world they made an impression, mom was still sick and takin new meds, they made her hallucinate and messed with her head, so now I get wakened not only by lack of breathing, but also by her running in my room screaming, through all this shit I always made it to school the next day, my eyes drooping, so tired, head starting to sway, but I had new friends to help me find a way, gave me a reason to be, a reason to breathe, so i guess what I am trying to express is don’t look at me and just see what you see, cause you didn’t walk in my shoes, you never drove down my highway, I have no excuse for what I choose, I just do it my way, cause I’ve been all alone since I was 13, you could never know of the hurting, the many nights that I hid and I cried, the nights that the kid in me died, cause I was forced to grow up too quick, get so depressed that I throw up so sick, so before you rush to judge me or my mother, open your eyes get out from under the cover, and if you happen to tell your best friend they’re not, understand that you may be all they got, anyway that is ALL TRUE, if you know me you know I would not lie to you, so don’t ever question any thing with me and my mom, that’s how we are and you are so wrong, and if you aren’t my best friend then I guess it’s so long.
 
 sash says: July 12, 2011 at 7:43 pm 
That was very sad to read, Im very sorry for what you are going through. It sounds like tho that you are a very good person because of it. You stand by your mom and that is wonderful, I know you love her very much. I can’t even imagine what your going through.

I’m sure your friend will still be there for you. Just understand this tho, it is not his fault what is happening to you. Also remember even tho you have a right, he may not excuse you for acting out because of how your life is. He may feel like because of all of what you have said that he should feel sorry for you and not be able to express his real feelings to you.

It really sounds like you need someone to talk to besides a friend. You have alot to deal with at your age. Maybe you can get the school counselor to set you up with someone who can help you to deal with all that you have to live with. I understand how scary this is for you.

You really said alot, I’m glad you know how to express what is inside of you. I don’t know how you do this alone. I hope someone comes along somehow in your life that can help you with your mom. you have your hands full. Are there any relatives there who can help or does she have any close friends to help? Does your dad pay child support? I hope that someone will read this that can help you in some way. This is so very heart touching. Im afraid I will say wrong words. I really hope you can get a social worker or someone to help you. I fear this is to much for you. I know you must stay stong for your mom and I;m sure your mom trys to stay strong for you. You are a blessing to her. You will not regret taking care of her and I feel because of this that good things will start to happen to you in your life. I wish you the best of luck and I pray it all works out for you.

You sound like such a good person that I’m sure you will have plenty of friends to be there for you. Don’t give up on your friend so easy ok he may have things going on in his life too. I’m sure they don’t compare to yours but still, it sounds like he means alot to you so you two need to talk this out.

Best of luck to you and your mom!

What do you think of my short story?
What do you think?
i wrote this for school and wondered what people thought
its about a girl, who finds out her best friends dad hits her

“Josh asked me to the dance, but so did Charlie…. and James…. who should I go with?”I asked Callie. Callie just kept playing with the grass.
“Callie?”
“huh?”Callie looked up confused.
“Never mind, who are you going to the dance with?” I asked.
“No one”she said simply.
“What why not?”I asked confused.
She shrugged “I just don’t want to go”I stared at her as if she were crazy.
“Did anyone ask you?”I’m sure someone had asked, she is very beautiful with her long brown hair. Hazel eyes and freckled skin.
“Yes a few guys did ask me I just really don’t want to go”.
“But you’ve never been to a school dance, you are always sick or something”.
“My parents just don’t want me to go…”
“Your parents don’t let you do anything.”
She made a face“that’s not true”she argued
“Yes it is”
She sighed“ok maybe it is…they are just…..protective”
She rolled up her long sleeves “it’s hot”
“Mmm”I noticed a few small bruises on her arm
“Where did those come from?” I asked and touched them lightly
She rolled her eyes“me and my brother were playing around and he grasped my arm just a bit too hard”
I didn’t believe her because she and her brother Anthony hardly ever play around
“Okay”
“Hey lets get some ice cream and go to your house”she said and helped me up.
I smiled“okay”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We sat at Savannah’s house eating our ice cream.
“I’m wondering if I should get a new dress for the dance….. and I don’t know who to go with……”
Savannah is lucky she can even go to the dance and she had a lot of boys ask her…I had two but I can’t go anyway. My dad would hit me again just for asking.
She always gets what she wants and she is beautiful with her long fiery red hair and emerald eyes, she has perfect skin and is tall. I am short plumpy and plain looking. Everyone loves her she has at least a million friends. She sings like an angel and can dance me on the other hand….. I have one friend being savannah and I like to stay in the background. I love to write and draw.“Callie?”she said looking at me.
“Yeah you should go w/ josh and you should wear your strapless emerald dress to match your eyes”
She smiled satisfied.“Now how are we going to get you to the dance?”
I look at her as if she was stupid”uhh my parents would kill me for going”Literally I thought
She wasn’t listening “you can spend the night at my house and you can borrow a dress of mine…. who asked you again?”
“James and Brian”I mumbled.
“Who do you like more?”she asked
“Brian but I can’t go so it doesn’t matter.”
She still wasn’t listening “you can wear my baby blue dress”she said crossing the room to her closet.
Her room is another thing I’m jealous of. She has a huge room with a king sized bed a desk a TV a computer a huge mirror and a closet bigger than my room.
“Fine I will go to the dance but my parents can’t find out and if they do it’s your fault you forced me to go”I said giving up.
“YES!!!!!”she screamed and ran over and hugged me”you will have a lot of fun I promise”
I smiled I couldn’t help it her smile makes anyone want to smile“yeah now let me see this dress and what about shoes oh and I need to call Brian”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Do I really look okay in this dress? And how is my hair? And my make up? What if Brian doesn’t show up what if he really doesn’t like me?”Callie is freaking out as usual.
It’s the night of the dance and she looks gorgeous, she is wearing my baby blue satin dress that goes just below the knees and white heals her hair is up on her head and she has simple brownish eye shadow and pale pink lips.
“yes you look amazing you hair is cute and your make up is perfect Brian just called and said him and josh are on their way and im pretty sure he likes you if he asked you out”
I tell her and she relaxes a bit. I am wearing my sparkly emerald strapless dress with black heals. My hair is curly and wild, im wearing green eye shadow to match my dress and light red lip gloss. Earlier we had gotten our nails done to match our dresses. The doorbell rings and she immediately become tense again.
“Oh no oh no how do I look are you sure I look ok do I smell ok how’s my breath?”
I smile and shake my head.“You will be fine you smell good and im sure your breath is ok”
I link arms with her and we go downstairs.
The guys look great as usual josh is wearing nice jeans and a button up red shirt that makes his golden hair and almost orange brown eyes stand out even more, with the sleeves rolled up. His hair is a mess and he is all smiles. Brian is wearing casual dress pants and a green button up shirt with a black tie. His usually messy hair is brushed to look nice and he seems to be starring off into
This is all ive written so far, as soon as i write more i will put more up! thanks!

You don’t need to put the dialogue at the beginning of a sentence“He murmured,‘you look real nice today,’as he shoved his hands into his pockets.”(little example for you) and you don’t need to press that little Enter button beside you everytime they say something. If it is the same person then you can keep it on the same line. (unless you would like to add emphasis).
I liked your dialogue. It was very believable. keep up the nice work.

Please tell me what this piece makes you feel. (: x x

How can I escape my mother’s clutches?
You see, my sister and I get along great. (ages 16&amp;19) We’re like a two peas in a pod; wherever she goes, I go sort of thing. Anyway, our mother is slowly going nuts. She’s always been a tad on the angry side. Easily frustrated, easily stressed out. With that, she brings misery to everyone around her. A good amount of my childhood memories consist of me trying to avoid her. Since our parents got divorced, she’s been having financial problems as well, which only make things worse. She’s lost all sense of practicality and rational thinking. (she feeds the dogs cat food, even though I tell her it will give them major health problems, just to give some kind of example) Or even thinking at all. When she’s not working, she’s either gardening or her eyes are glued to the TV. She won’t even go grocery shopping! And when she does, it’s always junk food.Yes, our pantry is always stocked with chips and our freezer with ice cream. She never buys vegetables or fruit. When I asked her why she doesn’t ever buy vegetables or other ingredients for meals, she says its too expensive. I told her that if you cut out all the extra junk food costs, it’s actually about the same. She replied with“I don’t need a reason, it’s my money and I’ll do what I want with it”(that’s her reason for everything, by the way, it’s a control issue) But enough is enough! I want to be healthy! I want to be able to walk around my own house and be able to relax for once and not have to worry about her coming in and standing in my doorway repeating the same nonsense for sometimes even a half hour! (yes, you read that correctly. sometimes she will stand in my doorway and b!tch at me for a half hour, literally repeating the same thing in different ways)

I think she would be happier without having to support us. And I KNOW my sister and I would be jolly as can be if we could just get away and not be found.

So, my question to you is how do we go about leaving our oppressive, absolutely miserable life, and start new somewhere else without the law finding us and sh!tting all over us?
I’m kind of leaning towards Lord of Naught’s answer. just going ahead and moving out without permission sounds all well and good, but we need a sure-fire way to do this withOUT getting caught at all.

actually, moving out of the country and changing our names sounds good. we even picked out what names we would use.
Buuuuutt~ there is still the issue of money…I mean, we’re only 16 and 19 years old. plus, only one of us has a job. at publix. part time.
’nuff said.

Took in stray kitten few days ago,has fleas,now our Yorkie is scratching(de-wormed/de-flead Yorkie)What else?
Took kitten to vet and was injected with a broad spectrum antibiotic, anti-flea drops on her coat, anti-worm tablet, antibiotic eye cream for an infection. No offence to anyone but while we want to look after the kitten and will, our Yorkie comes first. We’re dog people more than cat people–but we’ll still look after the kitten. Couldn’t just leave the kitten to die in our garden (was weak, very thin, crying, disorientated, hungry, tired but amazingly timid and friendly) We gave our Yorkie an anti-worm tablet and we de-flead her with drops from the vet. We also got a 7in1 booster vaccine injection for her (from a vets) which we’re going to administer to her today (first time doing it ourselves!) It’s called“Vanguard DA2PI”and“Vanguard CPV-L”(covers the usual suspects: lepto, parvo, distemper etc) I think vets in the US say only inject every 3 years or something but vets here in Ireland say inject the 7in1 yearly.

Got something similar for the kitten (again we’ll have to inject it into her ourselves) Vets would charge €50 to vaccinate a cat or dog, that’s €50 each. We bought the stuff from a vets for €15 each (€30 to cover both)

Anyway, what else can we do to protect our Yorkie. If she is still scratching in a day or two it’ll probably mean the flea drops (called Advocat or something) didn’t work on her–can we then get more and de-flea her again? Thanks.

Btw, how do you introduce a Yorkie and a kitten? She goes ballistic when she sees the kitten but kitten doesn’t seem to have a clue what’s going on and remain very timid. We’re keeping them separate right now of course (Yorkie would probably kill her) Yorkie roaming house as normal and in her cage that we have in out tv room when we go to bed and kitten is in a toilet/shower room upstairs with the light on and the air ventilator on. Thanks.
Yeah, I know the q is a bit long. It’s a f****** essay not a question, lol. Thanks.
Pike: Yeah, we thought of that but as far as we know here in Ireland animal shelters don’t operate no kill policies. They’ll take the kitten but if a home can’t be found the kitten will be put down after x amount of time. As for local advertising, we’d be worried about that too–we know we’ll take care of her but we don’t know how someone else would treat the kitten.

Biggest woman problems to date..?
Okay, that’s it. I have had it up to my eyebrows with women. I’m a nice guy even if I may be an overweight man with not-so-good credit. Now before you feminists start ragging on me, hear me out here. No, I wasn’t rejected by some hot woman–on the other hand, I just got laid the other day. No, she didn’t cut my balls off or dump a brown log during intercourse. As you can see from this picture: http://i42.tinypic.com/28b880l.jpg I am a very neat man.

Here goes nothing: I often patron a local Starbucks near my workplace after 5pm armed with my laptop to read CNN while sipping French Vanilla. Until recently, I never considered any of the other regulars who sit at the tables and couches near me. That all changed on the second of April when another regular (female) came up to my table and asked if she could sit near me. On a more off-topic note, I opened my umbrella at work and got showered in confetti the day before that day. It was funny until I got stuck cleaning it up. Back on topic: I was reading a story about how an MMO led to a baby’s death in South Korea when I looked up to see a woman I could only describe as ravishing: she had Mediterranean features, smooth and tanned skin, gray eyes, full pouty lips and a body to die for. Of course I said yes: I had no idea that she would change my life forever.

We talked extensively about the economy, celebrities and for some strange reason, the topic veered off into pit bull breeds. It must have seemed strange to the other patrons: a fat ugly guy talking to a slim goddess. She didn’t come off as geeky or desperate: on the other hand, there were three guys checking her out as we left later on. What lured me in besides her looks was her personality: she wasn’t self-deprecating in her speech nor was she rambling about something stupid, like most women these days. Heck, she didn’t even look disgusted when I finished off five bear claws. I also noticed that she seemed overly charming, lighthearted and seemed a bit forward. I should have taken the hint then and there, but hey: I’m a desperate loser, right?

We arrived at her place: a small house that was 30 minutes from my condo. When I entered I noticed she was neat, but had food everywhere. She had a bookshelf full of stuff written by Shakespeare. She didn’t drag me to the bedroom, but I felt like she insisted on me with the tone and words she used.‘She didn’t need to’, I thought, so I went in. Long story short, I was now on the bed with the oddest and yet the most fascinating woman I had ever met. To be honest, the foreplay wasn’t that great, because it felt like she wasn’t really into it. She finally drags it for about another half-minute and then she finally talks. The minute she opened her mouth during sex, everything went downhill. She tells me that she wants to try something“different”–I’m thinking,“Whatever will help her get into it, I guess.”

Turns out,“different”turns out to be her gyrating on top of me, feeding me everything from powdered doughnuts to bananna cream pie–on her bed, naked. There I am getting pastries swiftly shoved into my fat pie hole, worrying about crumbs on the bedsheets and honey glaze and frosting in my hair. I can only describe this experience as revolting and dehumanizing: I had never felt so low in my life, besides that time I jerked it to a 40 year old woman on a home cooking show, because there was no porn in the house and my TV watching experience was heavily censored. I even tried to protest at one point, but she just kept shoving them in and I could barely breathe. After five more minutes of this, I pushed her off as hard as I could, put on my clothes, cleaned my face with napkins from the kitchen and drove off. When I finally got home, I collapsed on the floor and threw up all over the carpet. After dabbing the carpet with some wet soapy towels, I sat on my couch wondering why I couldn’t attract a normal woman who respected me because I was a nice person, not because the only thing she saw was a fleshy, sweaty bag of lard that happened to get her off. I think a long time ago, I told myself that I wanted this:“If only there were hot women who liked fat guys”, I joked to myself. Now that I got it, my self esteem and my dignity have reached new levels of low that I never thought possible, bringing with it an insatiable anger and a feeling of hopelessness and frustration. The good news is: at least I know I have standards now. So I decided instead to accept the facts and get help from the Internet.

So, my question to you is: Do you know any cheap RealDolls out there? Somewhere in the area of less than $5,000? I can’t afford the $11,000 ones and the inflatable ones look like something that came out of a horror film. I’m willing to buy used, if you like.
 
 ya no estoy , ya me fui says: July 19, 2011 at 7:17 pm 
you need to calm down…look at the problem, you said“If only there were hot women who liked fat guys”…why sshe has to be“hot”?…you are doing the same with girls that maybe are not”hot”as the bloody publicity say…

I thought I was a pretty girl, but nobody used to date me because I’m not the dam skinny girl, I’m a real woman with curves and little over weight…sometime I wonder“is there any guy who like me even if I’m not perfect?”and then years later I thought“wtf I am pretty, so if they don’t want to see it to hell with them…someone will have a heart for me”

and lucky me—I found him

What is the cream on the face of women with cucumbers on their eyes? look at Q for more info pls!?
i have seen many times on tv, as a part of adverts or in soap operas etc, a woman wearing a bathrobe (usually white) and with her hair wrapped in a towel. and on her face she has a cream covering all her face except her eyes and around her mouth. and on her eyes are cucumber slices.

what i would like to know is just what type of cream does the woman have on her face?

thanks!
what do the creams do? are they depilatory creams or skin–softening?
 
 bball7 says: July 26, 2011 at 11:24 am 
The cream is usually some sort of mask. Some harden over time, some peel off, but most of them are washed off after a certain period of time. There are many different kinds of facial masks, and many can be purchased at drugstores and beauty-supply stores. The masks can be used for a number of different things such as skin-softening, moisturizing, and exfoliation.

Is this a type of schizophrenia?
I’m in my early 20′s.
I’ve researched all the different types of schizophrenia and I wonder if I might have it. If I do, it’s not in a serious stage or anything but I do think I have it. I don’t have hallucinations so it’s not paranoid although I am a paranoid person. I’m not always like this. I bounce back and forth from seeming like a normal person to seeming schizophrenic.
When I’m out in public…especially around teenagers and/or loud people…I get really anxious because I feel like they’re reading my mind. I have to think to myself,“shut up. shut up”so I won’t think something stupid. If they laugh, I think it’s because they can hear my thoughts and they think I’m stupid.
When I was working as a janitor and if I was using the restroom, I’d look all over the place to make sure they didn’t have any hidden cameras. I made sure I always worked efficiently so that if there was a camera in the bathroom, they wouldn’t think I was a bad worker.
In the backyard sometimes if I’m trying to hide something, I think my stepdad has hidden cameras so that he can keep an eye on everything. If I’m going into my parents’room, I usually think my stepdad has cameras in the room and their bathroom so that he can see things.
I sometimes think there’s an invisible demon following me. As I said before, I don’t see things but I sense them. I try to ignore them but if the anxiety gets so bad, I’ll elbow them or turn around and whisper“shut up! leave me alone!”
One time, I was afraid there was a serial killer in my closet. I wouldn’t look at the closet because I was afraid that if he knew I saw him, he’d kill me anyway. But if I pretended I didn’t know he was there, he would change his mind and leave me alone.
When I’m using the bathroom at home, the shower curtain has to be closed so no one with hidden cameras can watch me through the window above the shower. I never turn on the light directly above the shower so they won’t know I’m there.
Every night when it gets dark, I close all the blinds in the house (dining room and living room) because I don’t want them to watch me. I’ve never seen anyone in my backyard but I’m always afraid that someone is watching me. I can’t watch the TV comfortably if I know someone can see me.
In the past few days, I’ve been disorganized. I was dishing out ice cream and I almost left the carton open on the counter but I saw it in the corner of my eye and realized I forgot. The other day, I left my light on in my room and I didn’t even notice. That’s uncommon for me. I always keep my light off and my door shut so people don’t go in and snoop around.
When I send emails to certain people, sometimes I’m careful about what I write because I’m afraid the government raided that person’s house and is reading their emails.
So even though I don’t see or hear things and it’s not all the time (as I said before, sometimes I feel normal), is it possible I’m schizophrenic?

 SyntheticGirl says: July 26, 2011 at 6:49 pm 
I think it is possible. I’m schizophrenic, but I hallucinate too, that’s probably linked to the amount of LSD I take or because my mum is schizophrenic. The part about the serial killer in your closet is something I can really relate to because I used to think things like that; It was because when I was little my parents always told me monster stories. Not to make me behave [which is a horrible way to make your children behave anyway], but just because it was funny to them&amp;if I went into a panic attack or started crying they thought it was fun&amp;told me to grow up.
Did your parents do that? Because that might be what’s caused it; I don’t know how to fix it but atleast it’s a starting point.

I also get paranoid about the government spying on me. If I look at bondage I think other people are hacking me&amp;watching it too. If I’m listening to music through my earphones I start thinking it’s coming out of a speaker in my MP3 player [which, up until 2 days ago when I got a new one, didn&apos;t even have a speaker]. I hate it when people look at me; I can’t look at a stranger who’s looking at me. I’m always scared there’s groups of chavs behind me on the street shouting abuse at me and I just can’t hear it clearly, some times it’s so bad I run all the way home, even if I’m out of breath.&amp;I almost always sleep with my friend; If she’s not in I look a little for her and get worried about it, and if I know she’s staying somewhere for the night I keep all the lights on when I go to bed.

See a doctor :]&amp;Don’t settle for a 5-minute appointment, make sure they have a good listen&amp;a good think about your situation. Challenge their opinions and advice if you doubt them.

I hope you get better :]

Chapter 1

Katie boarded the Champion cruise boat, awaiting what she would find. She looked around, a young woman greeted her and took her bags, this could be fun. She thought. Katie’s family and her walked to there cabin. 3 beds, cream silk bedding with a touch of pear green accents. The flooring was solid Oak, and the paint was the exact color of the accents on the bedding.
Their bags were all laid down on their beds, one for Katie, one for her little sister Ellen, and their parent shared one. It was classy with a price. Royal luxury!
They unpacked there bags, hanging there clothes in the closets and dressers. Katie disappeared, she went to the bathroom.
Marble counter tops, golden sink, white pearl toilet, and granite bath tub. Still more, she ran to the living room, Plasma! Big Flat plasma screen TV, she had never ever seen one in her life! Leather sofa with adjustable seating so you could lay down!
“Oh my goodness” she panted
The kitchen, the kitchen was the kitchen looked so good there wasn’t an adjective to describe it!
There was a shake in the boat, sirens went off in a flash making it impossible to speak, sirens that Katie couldn’t take sirens that…
“MOM!!!!!! DAD!!!! ELLEN!!!” Katie screamed.
There was no response to the yelps.
“HELP!!!!!!!!!” She screamed again.
Ellen came running in
“Katie!!! Help me!!!” Ellen screamed
“What???” Katie replied
Katie grabbed Ellen in her arms as the boat tipped over, they couldn’t spot there family anywhere and the boat was suddenly flooded with the Caribbean sea.

Chapter 2

Katie still had Ellen clutched in her hands. Katie saw an opening in the window. She saw Ellen’s face, and looked dead. She couldn’t let her sister go, in all of the years, NO! she couldn’t Katie swam out of the shattered glass window, She scraped her knee with the precise point. She gulped a big chug of water. She kicked and with her free hand she pushed the water back, pushing, kicking, pushing, and kicking.
She wouldn’t let anything kill her, anything! She wouldn’t let anything kill her sister either. She came up to the surface trying to catch her breath, her sister still in her arms she swam parallel. She blinked repedily until she could find sight, she couldn’t see anything but open water, she gave up. Had no courage, nothing just a 11 year old girl. She turned back to face the boat, she saw a speck of something. Like land, and island. It was pale, but miles away, she couldn’t swim that far, especially with Ellen in her hands. But she couldn’t let Ellen go.
Katie pushed herself, pushed herself to swim another mile for hope of survival. Again, she pushed the water, kicked her legs.
25 minutes had passed, she still hadn’t made it. Katie began treading water, treading, and treading it. She swam again, still doing freestyle ad pushing, and kicking. Another 25 minutes passed, and another, and another. She still didn’t make she needed one last burst of her energy and she would make it.
She looked up, there it was right in front of her, her home, Just and island with sand and vines. Vines that were green bright green. She stood up onto the hot sand. She laid Ellen on her back, giving her CPR repedidly. Until she had breath. Ellen laid there. Blank, all she was, was blank. Katie wept.
“No!” she cried. “This couldn’t happen this wouldn’t happen, No , NO, NO!!!” she looked at Ellen. One last time she gave her CPR. She checked her heart beat. Single, she heard, beat….beat… She didn’t know if she had any pulse. She didn’t take Science that year.
Katie walked up the Island, and heard a cough, she looked back at Ellen. She saw squinting eyes and ran back.
“Katie,” she said.
“Oh my gosh your alive!!!” Katie began tearing
“Where is mom and Dad?” Ellen asked
“There dead.” Katie teared
“oh.” Ellen replied

Chapter 3

Ellen and Katie watched as the sunset set. There eyes filled with tears. Ellen hugged Katie. Katie hugged back. They looked at the reflection at the water, and the very tip of the cruise boat. Katie walked away, Ellen fallowed.
“We have to look for food, somewhere there hast to be food!” Katie said with hope. She looked in her pockets a pack of gum, a quarter, hand sanitizer, and a cell phone. Which was now useless. Ellen looked in her pockets, a sticker, and lip balm.
“Here,” Katie said while handing her sister a stick of gum.
“Thanks” Ellen replied. She unwrapped the gum and put it in her mouth.
Ellen spotted something reddish, something big. She ran over to it. It was circular, round and hard. She found a rock.
“What are you doing?” Katie asked
“Look, come here!”
Ellen hit the red fruit on the rock and juice spurted out of it, same with little tiny seeds with some sort of pulp around it. Ellen licked it, knowing nothing about it.
“mmm, tastes sweet” Ellen said
“let me taste it,” Katie exclaimed. Ellen handed her the round fruit. Katie licked it,
“mm, this is ummm, a …..I don’t know what it is, but it’s good, where did you did this” Katie asked. Ellen ran to the tree where she found it. They were all hanging there, looking like round apples. Katie jumped to reach one, They were too high.
“Ellen, how did you get one?”
“I found it on the ground see!”
There they were, plump red and beautiful all ready to eat. Katie grabbed to , same with Ellen. They put them near the rock where Ellen hit them to unleash there juices and seeds.
Katie stopped,
“How do we know these are edible? Katie asked. She gagged for a moment. About to vomit onto the sand. She threw up. Red juice appeared on the sand, and bits of seeds and other unnamed objects appeared.
“eeew!” Ellen said
“Sorry” Katie scrunched.
Ellen dropped the fruit. Thinking Katie was right. She kicked them into the sea and watched them float.
“Why did you do that?” Kati asked while wiping her mouth with her jacket.
“Cause you threw up, I thought they were poisonous!” Ellen exclaimed.
“I threw up because of the grilled cheese sandwich I ate!” Katie said.
Ellen walked over to the tree, kicked it, and 3 of the fruits fell onto the dirt. Ellen picked them up and put them near the rocks silently. Katie wondered. She walked around the tree, she saw some dead woods, and hit the tree. 2 fruits fell down. She smiled! She put them near the rock and kept hitting the tree. They were set with food, for now.

Ellen hit the red fruit on the rock and juice spurted out of it, same with little tiny seeds with some sort of pulp around it. Ellen licked it, knowing nothing about it.
“mmm, tastes sweet” Ellen said
“let me taste it,” Katie exclaimed. Ellen handed her the round fruit. Katie licked it,
“mm, this is ummm, a …..I don’t know what it is, but it’s good, where did you did this” Katie asked. Ellen ran to the tree where she found it. They were all hanging there, looking like round apples. Katie jumped to reach one, They were too high.
“Ellen, how did you get one?”
“I found it on the ground see!”
There they were, plump red and beautiful all ready to eat. Katie grabbed to , same with Ellen. They put them near the rock where Ellen hit them to unleash there juices and seeds.
Katie stopped,
“How do we know these are edible? Katie asked. She gagged for a moment. About to vomit onto the sand. She threw up. Red juice appeared on the sand, and bits of seeds and other unnamed objects appeared.
“eeew!” Ellen said
“Sorry” Katie scrunched.
Ellen dropped the fruit. Thinking Katie was right. She kicked them into the sea and watched them float.
“Why did you do that?” Kati asked while wiping her mouth with her jacket.
“Cause you threw up, I thought they were poisonous!” Ellen exclaimed.
“I threw up because of the grilled cheese sandwich I ate!” Katie said.
Ellen walked over to the tree, kicked it, and 3 of the fruits fell onto the dirt. Ellen picked them up and put them near the rocks silently. Katie wondered. She walked around the tree, she saw some dead woods, and hit the tree. 2 fruits fell down. She smiled! She put them near the rock and kept hitting the tree. They were set with food, for now.
sorry i did it twice oops!

Why do people treat me so bad?
Please read this, i know it’s long but i’m gonna freak out if i don’t hear an advice soon.

I’m an intelligent student. I do lot of things good and i’m a complete nerd with maths. I’m not a nerd, i love to dance, go to the park, to the movies, just be with my friends without talking about class. Recently i entered to youth and now i’m feeling the need of having friends to share my time, but i just can’t find them. I tried to with lot of people, but if they don’t call me a gay, they think i’m a nerd or a stupid guy that only likes reading. Teachers love me and everybody can see that, even a French teacher that i have said in front of the class that she has never seen a guy as clever as me in the whole france. Recently a new guy and girl entered to my school. THEY ARE GORGEUS. They are models, and lot of time are doing photoshoots. The boy is white, blue eyes, blond hair, tall, perfect nose and ears and the girl is 10 times more beautiful. I fall in love with her but she rejects me in front of the people, and it hurts to see that EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL is with them just because they look like 2 greek gods. When i saw that the things didn’t workout with the pritiest girl i went to another girl that’s AMAZINGLY GORGEUS, but i found out that more than 15 girls of my class have a crush with the model guy that goes to my class.People HATES ME and they tell it to me. And recently the model guy was approaching to me, but i found out that he was using me so that the teachers put a good grade to him. My skin color is brown, my mouth is 4 times the size of a regular mouth and my nose is horrible and my hair is short.
People can stop saying that i look like a gorila and that i’m a freak with 2 feet that loves maths more than girls. I haven’t been able to stop crying these past days. People in my class even have a little forum on my class’s page in wich they talk how stupid and ugly i am. And by the time i keep being showed on TV and the local’s newspaper they hate me lot more. I hate going to school everyday and watch the mean looks the guys in class give me.

Why are they so b1tchy with me? It sucks to be all by myself on satuday’s afternoon eating ice cream at the park. Now i understand that girls don’t look inteligence and maturity in guys, they just look a good body.

I’m 14 and i’m also good at sports and y play 2 instruments.

I couldn’t stop crying writting this…It’s hard to face reality this way.

Hello. Don’t worry about the kids at your school. They are bit*** that don’t appreciate life. And they hate on you. When you grow up and have a very good job, they are going to end up in the local dumpster LOL. It must feel really bad huh? Well don’t worry! Nobody is perfect! And don’t worry about how you look! Fu** your classmates! Dont worry and well….just keep been smart and remember that God wants you to be happy. So think about God and don’t think about who likes you at school and who doesn’t like you, ok? You’re who you are and you’re awesome the way you are. I wish everyone saw things the right way, but some people are just h03$ and they will never undertand nothing. DON’T WORRY ABOUT ANYONE OK? BE YOURSELF!

Please read this! It’s important!?
I saw this in a question on Yahoo not too long ago. My husband’s work is organizing a drive for troops in Iraq (for things like toothpaste, toothbrushes, razors, shaving cream, etc). I made a few signs and posted this on each of them. What do you think?

You stay up for 16 hours
He stays up for days on end.
You take a warm shower to help you wake up.
He goes days or weeks without running water.
You complain of a‘headache’, and call in sick.
He gets shot at as others are hit, and keeps moving forward.
You make sure you’re cell phone is in your pocket.
He clutches the cross hanging on his chain next to his dog tags.
You talk trash about your‘buddies’that aren’t with you.
He knows he may not see some of his buddies again.
You walk down the beach, staring at all the pretty girls.
He patrols the streets, searching for insurgents and terrorists.
You complain about how hot it is.
He wears his heavy gear, not daring to take off his helmet to wipe his brow.
You go out to lunch, and complain because the restaurant got your order wrong.
He doesn’t get to eat today.
Your maid makes your bed and washes your clothes.
He wears the same things for weeks, but makes sure his weapons are clean.
You go to the mall and get your hair redone.
He d oesn’t have time to brush his teeth today.
You’re angry because your class ran 5 minutes over.
He’s told he will be held over an extra 2 months.
You call your girlfriend and set a date for tonight.
He waits for the mail to see if there is a letter from home.
You hug and kiss your gi rlfrie nd, like you do everyday.
He holds his letter close and smells his love’s perfume.
You roll your eyes as a baby cries.
He gets a letter with pictures of his new child, and wonders if they’ll ever meet.
You criticize your government, and say that war never solves anything.
He sees the innocent tortured and killed by their own people and remembers why he is fighting.
You hear the jokes about the war, and make fun of men like him.
He hears the gunfire, bombs and screams of the wounded.
You see only what the media wants you to see.
He sees the broken bodies lying around him.
You are asked to go to the store by your parents. You don’t.
He does exactly what he is told even if it puts his life in danger.
You stay at home and watch TV.
He takes whatever time he is given to call, write home, sleep, and eat.
You crawl into your soft bed, with down pillows, and get comfortable.
He tries to sleep but gets woken by mortars and helicopters all night long.
I’m not running this. I’m only helping out a bit. Yes, cutting it down a little.
Not trying to guilt them at all! Just trying to show them how bad soilders have it and that we are blessed.

This is SO true. Soldiers put up with crap and they get treated like crap. I don’t think that everyone knows what a soldier goes through when they are one. My husband is a marine and he got home from Iraq a week before our twins were born. My husband has been deployed 3 times in the past two years.
They go through all this. I am so thankful for what our troops do and thankful for everything we have.

Ok, I started to write a book a while back?
but it is terrible lol, I will have to rewrite the whole first 2 chapters, but I dont know about this one, its chapter 3. story is a girl who has landed a job in New York as a stylist. She is just setteling in, in this chapter what do you think?

As I enter Gaz’s apartment it reminds me of my mothers’house . Everything is perfect, not one thing out of place. Its all white; the sofa’s, the wall‘s, the unit’s, even the TV. I have to pinch myself, it’s so easy to mistake it for heaven. Oh god it is heaven, I must be dead…just my luck ! I’m just expecting Gaz to turn around any moment, with a 6ft wing span and say”hi darling, welcome to the big house in the sky, you got in the elevator and crash, bang…..well you know the rest”.

“So England eh? I’ve never been, what’s it like?”Gaz says as he rolls up an exercise mat; which, is the only thing in the house that has any color ; a lovely shade of blue, reminds me of this gorgeous dress I have.

“Yeah its ok, New York looks far more interesting though”I say still slightly stunned at the perfect and clean apartment he has going on .

“Oh it is darling, it’s just fabulous, any who would you like a green tea?”He asks as he walks into the big….wait for it .. white kitchen. God how does he not get lost in here ? Everything blends in together, I would walk into everything; I would constantly be in hospital”Yes doctor, sorry I walked into the wall again, trying to find the door”.

“So have you been in New York long?”I ask. He nods his head up and down, while stuffing his face with a big cream cake.“Yes sweetheart, I’m a New Yorker born and bred “. As we go back into the living room, me with my hands out in front; trying to feel for the sofa. We sit down and I have an awful thought. Oh god imagine Mother Nature just decided to come along right now, how would I explain that one, on his gorgeous sofa too, well the place does need a bit of color, no Sophie stop being a bitch, doesn’t suit you. I notice the gorgeous glass table he has in front of the sofa, but it’s not what catches my eye, it’s the mountain of vogue magazines sitting on top of the table.

”Your girlfriends into fashion then?”I ask, oh why did you ask that Sophie? He is obviously gay. See I get nervous in certain situations and this is one of them, I can tell because my red face is reflecting of the walls, and it seems like the whole room is glowing with me.

“Ha ha, no darling, I do not do girls, I think you have to ask Eugene the address of his opticians”he laughs.

“So what you here for ?”asks Gaz, now stuffing a massive bag of crisps into his mouth, how does he do it ? If that was me that cream cake would have gone straight to my hips, and they crisps right down to my ass.

“You know GLAM UP ! Well, I’m the new stylist”.

”OH MY GOD”he screams.“You…have…got…to…be…kidding…me”he shrieks while clapping his hands like a performing seal at deep sea world.“You have got to take me one day with you, please, I will be good“. I barley even know this guy, and its just a new job I’m starting, as if I’m really going to take him.“Ok, yeah no Probs, maybe one day“. I say, hoping he won’t mention it again. I suppose he is cool in a way.

“So anyway, can you turn the music down, so I can try to get some sleep, please?”I ask.“Sure thing darling, anything you want , if it means I might meet some gorgeous celebs. I will do whatever you want.“ Oh no he isn’t going to forget it is he? Maybe he will walk into one of his doors, and bang his head so hard he will forget. He will just think I’m the cool English girl , knows the beckhams, and moans about the music.

PLEASE learn the correct use of the apostrophe. In the first paragraph alone I see mothers’sofa’s wall’s….. at which point I gave up reading.

If you’re going to write, it is ESSENTIAL to understand the rules of language.

R&amp;P: Remember the Rollins Interview I Promised?
I want to thank those who participated in providing question suggestions the last time I posted my Henry Rollins question. Even though I extended it as long as i could, I decided it was unfair to pick a“best answer”since you all were awesome in providing questions.

So, here I am posting a raw transcript of my interview with Henry Rollins which is yet to be pulished in a couple of weeks. If you see your question answered, pat yourself on the back 

Interview with Henry Rollins: February 2, 3:42 p.m. Mountain Time

Q: Lenny Bruce, Brother Theodore, George Carlin: Did any of these outspoken performers play any influential role in your spoken-word technique or philosphy?
A: Bruce and Carlin certainly have given me a lot of courage. When you consider what Bruce got shut down for, he is a true child of the First Ammendment. Carlin made me understand the power of words and I always admired how long he stayed working. I know that I will have not nearly the span of Carlin but people like him, Lenny Bruce and Brother Theodore are so rare.

Q: At what age did you discover your“wayward/insubordinate”self? When did you probably start questioning authoritative society (e.g. Orwell’s“Animal Farm”is what did it for me in fifth grade)…
A: The aforementioned as well as The Clash, The Sex Pistols and my friend Ian MacKaye made me see things differently. I guess all of that started happening in my early teen years.

Q: Do you think Pop Culture has dumbed down our nation?
A: If it has, it can’t be a new phenomenon. Pop music has been with us for decades. I think that corporate media has done Americans a great disservice in that they have deprived America with any consistent degree of transparency. I think we are not as religiously fundamental as other nations in spite of all the attempts to make us so.

Q: It’s every liberal’s dream to tell Ann Coulter to“shut the fuck up”. I recall once, in your“Letters From Henry”portion of The Henry Rollins show, you directed a letter to her; how gratifying was that? Ever get a response?
A: It didn’t do anything for me, really. Ms. Coulter is just a professional wrestler who has not nearly the fan base that many would think. I have never heard from her. I think at one point, Fox News barked at me but no one really watches Fox.

Q: I have heard stories that you and Ian MacKaye met while working at a Hagen Daaz? Is this true? If so, how old were you both? What’s one of the earliest memories that crosses your mind?
A: I met Ian behind his mother’s house while riding my bike. This was many years before I was working at the ice cream place. I have known Ian since I was about 12 or 13. I am 49 now. Ian is the first person of my age group that had his own opinion that I was aware of. I was nothing like that.

Q: You are both credited with sparking the“straight edge”movement, so how did you feel about singing songs like“Six Pack”and“TV Party”during your time in Black Flag, even though you don’t drink alcohol or engage in that sort of behavior?”
A: I had nothing to do with straight edge really. The songs you mention are parodies as the lyrics make obviously clear.

Q:“Eye Scream”was probably my favorite of the books that I’ve read, that you wrote. There was something very“beat”. Did any of the City Lights Books roster of writers influence you?
A: I tried to read Burroughs and could never complete a book. The Beats never grabbed me besides Ginsberg’s Howl, which I thought was incredible. The thing I wrote in Eye Scream called Everything, is a tribute to Howl.

Q: Being a publisher yourself, have you ever had the chance to get to know Lawrence Ferlinghetti?
A: No.

Q: Jello Biafra, even Hunter S. Thompson, who followed a somewhat punk ethic, attempted politics. Is it within the realm of possibility for you to ever consider, maybe down the line, running for some sort of office to change things directly (or would that go against the grain of what you stand for?)
A: I have not the intellect or stamina to get any traction in that arena. I like being a private citizen, it gives me a lot of lattitude.

Q: When you played the role of AJ Weston in the FX television series“Sons of Anarchy”, did you have to“empathize”to a certain degree with the white supremist’s character to play the part convincingly? Did it ever disgust you?
A: No. It’s just work and I do it the best I can. I know that I am acting and that at the end of the day, I get in my car and leave the set.

Q: Do you mind getting killed off in most of the movie roles you do? Any upcoming movie roles?
A: I don’t mind at all. I am grateful for the work. I work for a living. I am not an artist.

Q: Details magazine named you Man of the Year in 1994. Did you hesitate to accept this title? Or was it an honor?
A: It wasn’t a title they give out yearly, it was just something they put on the cover. I was happy for the coverage and hoped it would help my band.
holy crap! haha. it’s only a matter of time before its pulled…. forgot about the Ann Coulter expletive LOL

Thanks everyone for your input
Hey Shades, maybe we ought to re-post this on R&amp;S, and we’ll get some foaming-a-the-mouth responses over his Fox News remark. LOL

Thanks sookie
LOL hey Beatle, looks like we’re both geriatrics. This is going to be publiished online, with the local entertainment weekkly

Hi MachPen, long time no see!
Great interview, I especially like the Ann Coulter question and his answer.
Where will this interview be published?

(I noticed in your profile that you are 110 years old so we should really get together because I’m 105, hope I’m not too young for you)!

What do you think of the begginning of my story?
Constructive critisism is greatly accepted, remember I’m really young, barely 16.
Natalie Carlyle by L.G.
Part 1- Jake (Sunday Night)
I called her one more time. I had rung the door bell and even knocked. All the lights were on in the house but there wasn’t a car parked in the driveway. I took hold of the brass doorknob and turned it. The door opened and I walked into the open townhouse. I smiled when I saw sixteen Natalie Dakota Carlyle, my steady girlfriend of 8 months sleeping face down on the worn leather sofa. Her hair was flattened down the back of her large gray sweatshirt that concealed her petitie torso. I smiled at the fact that she was wearing the jeans I bought for her for her birthday. They fit her perfectly.
The flat screen tv was blaring in the background. I looked for the remote but the coffee table was covered in coffee cups and glasses full of half melted ice. I shook Natalie’s shoulder softly. She didn’t wake up.
I shook her a little harder. Her head turned to face me, her eyes closed. Her beautifuly thick, dark eyelashes flickered open. Her deep navy, ocean blue eyes stared up at me.
“Hey Jake,” she smiled at me.
“I missed you,” I leaned over and hugged her closely. I had been in Southern California for the past 5 days, visiting colleges, going to the beach and vacationing. I had missed her like crazy. I only had tonight with her before another long week of school. “So where are your parents?” I asked softly.
“Out, I think,” she murmured in a sleepy tone.
“You okay, babe? You look exauhsted.” The truth was half the time she didn’t look ok.
“I just need to wake up a little,” she yawned. I sat down on the sofa next to her feet.
For a second I worried that she wasn’t happy to see me. That maybe in those 5 days I had been away she had forgot about me and found someone else. But the truth was she never looked truly happy. I’ve seen her pretend but never had I seen a real, lively gleam be drawn from her eyes. I remembered first seeing her.
The gym was filled with lots of students watching the boys varsity basketball game. I wasn’t focused on the court though, my eyes went to the sidelines. The cheerleaders doing all sorts of crazy stunts and amazing flips. One particular girl with sparkly blue eyes and shiney brown hair being thrown intot he air(In later what I found out was a twist cradle).In just that second I knew that she was strong, imagintive and effortless. From that moment on I knew I wanted her. Days went on and I realized she was everywhere. At lunch, in my gym class playing basketball and volleyball, around the whole highschool campus in between classes.She seemed to be a very outgoing person. She was friendly and funny. I asked her out and we went on date after date. Out for pizza, to the movies, to college basketball games and out to dinner. As I got to know her deeper, beneath her dazzling smile and wide blue eyes, I noticed she was different. She was appreciative, polite, everything you wanted your girlfriend to be. But she was challenging, she wasn’t one hundred and ten percent communative. It was almost like she was hiding things. Mostly I thought that because she was this way, that she needed me. Natalie needed me to love her and be someone that she could trust.
Weeks went on and we got more serious. She was only a sophomore and I was a senior. Yet she was perfect. Her age didn’t change anything. We got along so well. At times I felt as though that Natalie was older than me and that in some ways, she was more serious than me. That her mind and thought was broader and more mature than my own. I knew we would last. And here we are several months later. Dakota squeezed my hand and I snapped out of it.
“Do you wanna go out?” I asked. She shook her head.
“Let’s just hang out.”
She grabbed my hand and led me up the cream-carpeted stairs to her bedroom. The first door on the left. I took in all the details of her room I had missed. The walls of her room were completely blank and painted pure white. Her princess-like bed was covered in breadspread of espresso and champagne colors. All the mahgony wood on the matching furniture looked as if it had all been polished. It was almost like a hotel room, so clean and in a way empty. It felt hard to believe that this room was lived in, that it had been home to someone for 15 years. The window in front of it was cracked open so the cool almost-december air flooded in, adding a chill to the room.
I shut the door quickly and grasped Natalie’s neck with my left hand, I held her face with another. I kissed her cherry red lips softly and warmly, which is what I wanted the whole time we were apart. I want to touch her soft skin and kiss her.

Part 2 -Natalie (Monday Morning)
I woke up the morning we were going back to school from the long weekend. The clock read 7:00. My parents had already left for work. I felt like a complete mess and I only had 20 minutes
The clock read 7:00. My parents had already left for work. I felt like a complete mess and I only had 20 minutes. The smell of artificial heated air filled my bedroom. A headache started in the back of my head.
I got up and stood in front of the full-length mirror. My big navy blue eyes were bright but started to throb. My deep espresso brown hair was dark and straight but still slightly highlighted with golden blonde pieces from the summer. After showering, and putting on subtle make up, I dropped my toweland stood naked in my closet, looking for something to wear.
Jake’s car beeped from the driveway and I raced to the front door grabbing my bags on the way. I ran out of the house and into the cold, crisp late fall air. Jake smiled at me. I smiled back, even at the ungodly hour of 7 am. He walked toward me and hugged me close, tightly. I pressed my hair to his chest, feeling him squeeze tight.

I think it is great. But I have a tip on your writing skills. As a writer too, be more elaborate and take note on the word counts. Some novels are long and most of them are really bestsellers. The reason? Because they are really elaborated and detailed and that is what I think you lack. Try making more scenes before they got serious. Also why not make the serious part on chapter 2 or 3? I hope this was helpful.

What does this dream mean? (Long)?
So I had a dream a few nights ago that I remember vividly. I haven’t quite figured it out yet but here it is.
Also I am a male and in his late teens.

In the dream I was at my old house, which in that neighbourhood had some little kids, maybe 7-10 years old that would always play outside. But I was in my garage in this one and the garage door was open. What was strange was that I knew I was being kept by what I thought to be was some evil witch or a nanny dressed in black. I was tied up by my hair. My hair in this dream seemed to be in some sort of pony tail even though I have buzzed hair. I found scissors and cut my hair (at this point I was very frightened) and started booking it down my driveway out of my cauldosack. On the way down I found my old dog who we gave away about two months ago running in front of me. He was looking back but I just kept telling him to go. So after that there was snow on the ground, but not on the road or driveways. I was running right in front of people’s houses to think that I could escape more sneakily that way. I was having trouble climbing over the snow banks sort of and so was my dog but then I started to hide behind one. I looked back and saw the lady in black gliding or walking really fast down the street laughing like a witch.

At this point I was about to run but saw a big black suv pass by so I waited for that then slid down the driveway I was crouched on on my butt. I then ran down to the end of the street where three little kids were, though I have never seen them before. Now there was no snow and my dog wasn’t seen. They turned around at me and I told them that they needed to help me get out of here so who appeared to be the oldest suggested I climb on her back. She seemed she was maybe 13 but she was very tall. The other two were little boys.

So I hopped on her back and for some reason I started checking her out and felt her nipple which was hard. So then she started walking down the street slowly and I told her to go faster. A couple seconds later the lady in black came up in front of us and said that she had caught me but in the typical witch’s voice and that laugh she had. The tall girl let me go and she turned into one of those lady’s as well. Just her face did, and I remember all her teeth looked like uneven fangs and her eyes were huge.

After this, I was back at the house like the first part of the dream. I took the scissors and cut my hair that was tied to something and ran. This time I just kept running til the end of the street where I was with my dad and sister. I was now in a car and got out of it where my dad’s friend lived. This was a very strange house. We went inside but I talked to my sister quietly that I wanted to leave (just cause) so we all left and when we got out I started running again. I ran back this time but to someone else’s house. This girl was there with a huge container of ice cream the size of a tv dinner tray table. Another kid was there who got ice cream and so I asked for some as well. After I got some I walked out sort of and then the dream ended.

The color black come back often in your dream ; which denote lots of sadness in your life . Not only you feel alone ; you are also very strict and demanding toward yourself . The witch who is watching you ; is part of your personality ; who is stopping you from having a great personality

Damned by Advertisement

“Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline.” We’ve all heard this slogan somewhere whether it was seen on TV, read in a magazine or on the Internet. What this ad is trying to accomplish by stating, “Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline” is that the model was not born with “beauty”, it simply came from applying the makeup to her skin. Maybelline is known for their bold advertising using beautiful women with flawless faces. Their two-paged color ad in this month’s People magazine last month is no different. The use of sex appeal, color, and text is what make another effective make-up ad. Companies spend billions of dollars each year on ads using these techniques along with the main initiative: Sex sells. The developers of this advertisement are trying to persuade readers that Maybelline would give them the beauty they always dreamed of.
The brightest and most decisive part of the ad is the model’s skin. They chose a stunning woman with beautiful radiant skin to lure you into buying Maybelline’s newest cream foundation. Her gentle green eyes are what first grab ones attention when flipping through the magazine. The sultry look in her eyes suggests that she feels sexy wearing the foundation. You cannot help but stare an extra moment. Everyday people are looking for ways to improve or change their looks. A beautiful woman can sell more products than a hideous woman merely because hideous woman are not appealing.
The photo is positioned to the left of the page, with text to the right. First of all, the layout needs to be simple and organized. There is nothing more irritating than reading a busy ad. Simple is powerful. It is obvious that the photographer used light and colors to enhance the glow of her skin. The placement of lights in the studio illuminates her face. Her head is tilted just right, so the left side of her face is slightly shadowed. Shadowing this way keeps the reader’s focus on face.
To help convince you to buy this foundation they incorporated text into the advertisement. The text that grabs my attention is the most is “NEW INSTANT AGE REWIND!” In this text they used everything they could to make it stand out. To begin with, the creators added color to the word new. Second, they bolded and used upper case enlarged letters. Written on the right of the model is, “REWIND THE YEARS, INSTANTLY! NOW, CUSTOM RAPIANT PERFECTION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.” This implies that one can make themselves look many years younger. All of the text on the ad is in upper case. Upper case gives an exciting effect as if one was yelling. “REWIND THE YEARS, INSTANTLY” looks a lot stronger than “rewind the years.” The second sentence states that perfection can now be at your fingertips. This entails that perfection is easy access and there is no sense in paying for expensive treatments. Under the text are more attention grabbers. Half-way down the shows the shade of the foundation and a picture of the special pad. In a short few sentences it explains the use of the product. Underneath, is a picture of the actual foundation. This was done so when the customer spots the product in the store they will remember the ad and how magnificent the foundation looked on the model.
To appeal to a variety of women, Maybelline shows that the foundation is available in other skin tones. Certainly a dark skinned woman would not buy a light tone simply because it would not blend with her skin. By including other tones the advertisers again try to entice you to buy this foundation.
Beneath the skin tones, Maybelline’s classic logo is subtly across the entire two-paged ad. They did this so the reader would not be distracted from the model’s portrait or the introduction of the new foundation by a larger headline. Under the large logo is Maybelline’s slogan “Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline.” Earlier in the essay I explained that this slogan tricks readers into thinking they will turn into a princess if they apply this foundation to their skin. On top of the large logo is the website for those interested in learning more about Maybelline.
Overall, this ad works because, it appeals to key things women look for in a make-up product. Women want to look and feel beautiful, so the ad team used a gorgeous, confident looking model. The average reader does not take into consideration light usage, computer enhancements, and photographic trickery. So when looking at the ad, readers subconsciously think that, Maybelline products will give one confidence, and beauty. Women also like to feel sexually attractive when they put make-up on, especially foundation. Not all women are born with acne free skin. That’s why they make foundation! So when a woman puts on the foundation, she feels attractive.
Finally, the last text on the bottom of the ad explains Maybelline’s secret. It explains

“Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline.” We’ve heard this on a TV, read it in a magazine or on the internet. It’s everywhere. The ad tries to accomplish that the model was not born with “beauty”, but from the makeup to her skin by the company.
Maybelline is known for their bold advertising using beautiful women with flawless faces. Their two-paged color ad in this month’s “People” magazine last month is no different from the old. The use of sex appeal, color, and text is what makes it so effective to make those to buy. Companies spend billions of dollars each year on ads selling products, using these techniques to persuade the public to buy their product ,guaranteeing that they will give them the beauty they always dreamed of or seen.
Maybelline’s newest cream used a stunning, beautiful radiant female model luring people in the ad to buy their product. Her gentle green eyes grab ones attention when flipping through a magazine. The sultry look in her eyes suggests she feels and is sexy wearing the foundation. It is irresistible to stare an extra moment. Everyday people are looking for ways to improve or change their looks. A beautiful woman can sell more products than a hideous woman merely because hideous woman are not appealing.

The photo positioned to the left of the page, with text to the right (IN WHAT?). A plain simple neat ad so powerful keeps the reader’s focus on face of the model. ( how does the shadow make it luring? it does not make sense) But is this her natural look really? No of course not. It is obvious that the photographer used light and colours to enhance the glow of her skin. And to make it the model look even better the studio illuminates her face of what?.
Everyone wants to be young. Never aging forever a kid but it is impossible. We age and can not be stopped. Everyone wants to be young looking. “NEW INSTANT AGE REWIND!” the four words so powerful and commanding. The texts use stands out with the word NEW highlighted in upper case large letters. More powerful words to make those to buy expand across : “REWIND THE YEARS, INSTANTLY! NOW, CUSTOM RAPIANT PERFECTION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.” All of the text on the ad is in upper case giving one an exciting feeling of making other to want to look younger.
This entitles that perfection is easy access and no need of cosmetic surgeries but with a appliance of a cream. ( Under the text are more attention grabbers. Half-way down the shows the shade of the foundation and a picture of the special pad. Re word it’s so confusing) Only a short few sentences explaining the product’s use and a pictures. And then an over all look. Customers go to stores and see the product hanging there. They will remember how magnificent the foundation looked on the model. The urge to buy the product rushes through their minds.
 
 Dreamer says: July 21, 2011 at 11:51 am 
The weirdest dream I’ve ever experienced. What does this dream mean?
In my dream, I was hearing and seeing a semi-real life (in a make believe form) made-for-TV cartoon play before my eyes. The sound of the narrator’s voice was older and wise sounding. The narrator was talking about how a little boy cried when a mean old man took his pet pig and had its head cut off. Then, the little boy talked to his dad after having cried, and pleaded “Why did he do such a thing!” Then the boy said, “Piggy Wiggy was no bear, Piggy Wiggy had no head nor hair, Piggy Wiggy wasn’t Piggy, Wiggy?” Then, I saw the piglet’s head mounted to a roughly carved wooden body. The boy cried “Why did they do this to you, Piggy Wiggy?” Then the boy’s father said to me, “Did you ever wonder why they killed pigs in order to make bacon? I sure did.” I replied, “Well, for me it was ‘why do they have to kill cows in order to make ice cream?’.”

Then, as I was saying this, I began traveling in my body, floating about 30-50 feet in the air, and I traveled down a nearby road. I saw a stuffed black and white toy cow, which was near the road in someone’s front yard.

The next thing, I was talking with three college-aged students, about 21-22 years old. It was the either the year 1979 or 1980, as I could see these numbers in my mind’s eye. Their clothes, hairstyles, etc. reflected this very well. I could hear the song “Boogie Oogie Oogie” playing from a small radio in another room. These people were all about acting “cool” and putting on airs. I really felt like I had traveled back in time. The young woman, who was 22, was phony, and wore large frame glasses (just like those that were popular in the early 1980s), and she had an attitude. There were two guys there as well. One guy was wearing a thin polyurethane jacket with lettering, and had very curly hair, while the other guy had kind of medium-length, dark slightly puffy hair. I realized that I was in someone else’s body when I was talking to these people. I remember seeing the several of the rooms in the split-level ranch house, which was disorganized, and the small deck attached to the side of the house. I asked the woman about her drug use, which seemed to make her very defensive. The guys more or less mimicked her in a mild way in order to meet her approval.

Something in your life that happened recently has triggered feelings and memories of your hopes and dreams being torn apart.
The older wiser narrator is you as an older, wiser person. The little boy is also you, the boy’s father is yourself, the supposedly wiser person who destroyed your little boy self’s hopes and dreams represented by the pig. Once upon a time you hoped and dreamed to do something big and important, but in reality you chose to go a completely different path. Older and wiser now, you recognize it was a stupid choice to make (hence the seemingly stupid poem) and ultimately a hurtful choice (represented by the treatment of the pig). Something has happened, a recent choice or decision you made that went against your inner dreams, like giving up something wonderful in favor of taking care of a lame and stupid responsibility (along the lines of paying for a child’s preventable car accident or bailing a child out of jail instead of taking a nice long vacation–get my drift?), and you feel as hurt as you did when you chose as a teenager to give up your secret childhood wish or dream.
That’s part 1.
Traveling in your body is traveling to part 2. The road is your current path, the job or career you have now, the place you are living, etc. Apparently it is just there, benign, but the stufffed black and white cow represents some odd things. Black and white means you want your answers to your problems in black and white. The cow itself can have several representations, first it is a female, and second it is where milk comes from, meaning you wished a female mother figure would help you more often, but since your cow was a stuffed toy, you feel a bit let down by your female mother figures in your life. You passed it by because ultimately your female mother figure was of little or no help to you in your life, but secretly you wish she had.
Part 3 offers clues to your current situation. You had another opportunity to follow or pursue your secret childhood dream, didn’t you? And it was in college where you chose not to follow your childhood dream, but chose another path? The phony woman and the cool people putting on airs means you were influenced by the stupid trappings of what you thought meant to be a grownup–smoking, drinking, sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and now, looking back, you finally realize how stupid you were to be influenced by such false disguises. What was cool 20 years ago–the party scene–is no longer appealing to you. Your reference to the little boy inside you and the older, wiser you telling yourself of the“Piggy Wiggy”story means you wish you could somehow teach the next generation not to kill their dreams or be influenced by the stupid choices that were in front of you 20 years ago.
You know, the best advice I heard about going back to school was from someone who said,“yeah, it will take 10 years to get your degree. But you can either be 10 years older, which you will be anyhow, or you can be 10 years older with a college degree.”So I went back to school. 20 years later I am working on my 2nd degree and planning my first internship at the ripe old age of, well, old enough to be starting a 2nd career. Maybe you should start taking community college classes to get your feet wet towards working on your childhood dream. At the very least you could volunteer. Wanted to be a farmer? Try planting a garden or volunteering at the local community garden. Wanted to have a pig? Become a“gentleman farmer”and raise one or 2 piglets and sell them at the auction just for fun. By volunteering you try out your dreams for free and can walk away with no committments if you choose. But at least you can say you finally gave your childhood dream a shot.
Good luck. Really, try volunteering and give your childhood dream a try, regardless of what choices the next generation makes.

Dear xxx,

I don’t really know how to tell you this, but i’m joining the Convent. I think I realized it when your dog humped my leg in your closet and I saw you pull the pants off of the Catholic Priest. I’m sure you’re middle-class enough to understand that i get turned on only by garbage men. I’m returning your love letters to me to you, but I’ll keep your photo with the moustache drawn on it as a memory. You should also know that I havent showered in a month and you should get that embarassing rash checked.

What do you think of my story so far(need lots of opinions, easy points!!)?
The Legacy
A man of the age 32, stood at the front of his first class of the year. The business professor became more excited as the students slowly began to fill the rows of desks in front of him. He already observed that more that half the class was compiled of incoming freshman. The difference of how they carried themselves compared to upperclassmen was tremendous. He peeked at the roster of nineteen students before starting class.
“I’m Alex Carraway,” he paused. “Please call me Alex. Now when I call your name I’d like you to stand and tell the class why you you here.” Albee Anderson was the first name he called. The students all replied with textbook-deep answers. It wasn’t until Alex was two thirds through the list until he became interested in one.
“Ryan Logan.” The proffessor expected an English or Irish looking boy to stand up. Instead a girl wth light brown hair and pale eyes stood up. The girl twirled a ring nervously around her pinky finger. Not only was her name firmiliar to Alex but her looks were too.
“Your Ryan?” The class laughed. The girl nodded. I was already more intrigued about her name.
“I’m here because it’s a family tradition,” she looked directly into Alex’s colbalt blue eyes as she said this.
“Very interesting,” Alex commented. His mind rewinded one year. He could have remembered that face anywhere.
“Do you have a sister named Natalie.” The young freshman nodded. “You look exactly like her. After Alex’s encounted with Natalie Logan’s younger sister all the other students seemed less significant than they did at the beginning of class.
Later after attendance, Alex handed out the class syllabus and an overview. Many of the students, like usual, showed interest. Pleased with the first day of class, he let the students go early. As Miss Logan packed up her papers, Alex approached her after he packed his own bag up.
Eager to see if she was anything like her sister, Alex asked her if he could walk her to her next class. “I’m only going to get coffee actually. You can come with me if you want.” She added after a short pause. Alex accepted her invitation with a nod.
“So you were my sister’s teacher?”
“She took several of my classes, yes. You remind me a lot of your sister. Are you two close?”
“Yea, but she’s a lot older than me.” The two walked towards the coffee kiosk and waited in line.
“Medium coffee, cream and sugar plese.” Ryan told the barrista. Alex quickly remembered how Natalie prefered tea. Alex ordered a small Hazlenut, only to drop a five dollar bill on the counter before waiting on the other side of the kiosk.
“ I was very close with your sister. She’s a very special girl,” Alex blurted out quickly. Ryan stared Alex directly in the eyes. Her eyes were squinted and smoldering. Alex could feel a red hot light beneath her icy, sea green eyes burning a hole in his own. They lingered on each other for several seconds before they grabbed her coffees.
“I’m going this way,” Ryan broke the silence and motioned towards the English departments.
“And, I’m going this way.” Alex pointed in the opposite direction. “I’ll see you in class,Ryan.” He smiled before turning and walking towards his residence. Alex was slightly confused by the interaction, slightly because of the way he acted and partially because of her reactions. Alex returned to the home he lived in on-campus with a headache ten minutes later.
2- (3 weeks later)
Alex
I sat at my desk grading exams at 11 o’clock at night. Usually the job kept me up through the early hours of the morning. At this point I was frazzled and tied of reading sloppy handwriting. I returned to the living room and turned the telivision to channel 72. Distgusted by NFL, I flicked off the tv immediately. Instead I decided to go to bed early. As I layed alone in the dark room , my mind rapidly moved to where it had been over the past couple weeks.
Ryan Logan.
For one, the girl was nothing like Natalie. They had shared the same face but that was where it ended. Ryan was a sparky and sensuous girl, while her sister was more quiet and put together. With Ryan being around it had brought back the memories I had shared with Natalie. However feelings aroused in my head, leaving me wanting to see Ryan again.
I lay on the coach in the living room, holding Natalie close to me. Her shampoo smelled that something like Champagne or Cider was intoxicating and soft like silk. her skin like a babys’, it was pale and cold next to mine. My arms were wound tightly around her petite torso and I couldn’t help but smile as I kissed her neck. I lean over, staring at her pretty face. Her bright navy eyes are like oceans to me. Her eyelashes are long, thick and dark. She might be…No, she is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I kissed her cherry red lips.
rate and review.
any predictions???

After reading this excerpt of your piece I have to agree that their are grammatical errors. This isn’t that big of a deal because its all about plot, consistency, and your ability to express voice within your novel. I’m personally just starting a novel myself so I’m not an expert or anything. I see that you definitely have plot. The thing that concerns me, seeing that this is a romance, is that your making the characters go to fast (in terms of liking each other). Romance novels show the process of two people getting into a relationship and in most cases has an ideal ending. So my two suggestions is that you either not make it where the“persons eyes pierces my soul”in the first meeting, or you get rid of the 2-3 week thing that you did, and actually talk about whats happened. Put some spice in it, make yourself as Ryan or Alex; what would you do/ happen during that period do you think? Also (please don’t take anything I say to heart) I don’t get the part where Alex gets coffee with Ryan. I know your trying to initiate some interaction between the two, but coffee between a professor and student is unusual, especially meeting each other for the first time even though they have a mutual acquaintance. Besides all of that, I do think that you have a good story in the making. Flashbacks and memories are always nice to have, makes it interesting in a book to have a change in scene. Your style of writing is also one I enjoy because it seems like you are going to have chapters with different views from characters. If you don’t like my opinions, I’m sorry, but if you want more I wouldn’t mind trying to help.

What do you think of these descriptive passages?
I had been working on this story for awhile but it took a backseat to my new one.
Input I’m looking for: high and low points, likes/dislikes, areas for construction, overall opinions.

Natalie Blair Gicquel, age sixteen, lived in upstate New York. The suburban town of Stonybrook was full of identical townhouses along with a small, newly built elementry school, a middle school and a high school. Just outside the development was a street of small-town shops. During the month of November the town’s trees were bare and dusted with frost. The air was brisk throughout the duration of the day. In the mornings the town was dark, however during the afternoon a blinding yellow sun shine stood at the top of the sky.
On this particular Saturday afternoon Natalie lay asleep in her silk, champagne-colored bed sheets. The almost all neutral room looked stunning in the white light that shined through the drapes. The mahgoney bedroom set and floor shined beautiful as if it was brand-new. The completely blank, white walls a barely-lived in look; as if the spotless room didn’t already have that appeal.
Natalie was awoken by the distant chirp of a bird who had not yet taken its flight south. As her mind turned on her body remined dormant. Her head was heavy as well as her petite body. Her head pounded with agony against her down-feathered pillows.

Jake: the next day, sunday (sometime late at night)

I called her cell phone one more time. I had rung the door bell and even knocked. All the lights were on in the house but there wasn’t a car parked in the driveway. I took hold of the brass doorknob and turned it. The door opened and I walked into the nearly silent house. I smiled when I saw sixteen Natalie Gicquel, my steady girlfriend of 8 months sleeping face down on the worn leather sofa. Her hair was flattened down the back of her large navy sweatshirt that concealed her petite torso. I smiled at the fact that she was wearing the jeans I bought for her for her birthday. They fit her perfectly.
The silver, flat screen TV was blaring in the background. I looked for the remote but the coffee table was covered in coffee cups and glasses full of half melted ice. I shook Natalie’s shoulder softly. She didn’t wake up.
I shook her a little harder. Her head turned to face me, her eyes closed. Her beautifully thick, dark eyelashes flickered open. Her deep, ocean blue eyes stared up at me.
“Hey Jake,” she smiled at me, her beautiful dazzling smile..
“I missed you,” I leaned over and hugged her closely. I had been in Southern California for the past 5 days, visiting colleges, going to the beach and vacationing. I had missed her like crazy. I only had tonight with her before another long week of school. “So where are your parents?” I asked softly.
“Out, I think,” she murmured in a sleepy tone. She never knew were her parents were. They were silent. She might as well be living with total strangers.
“You okay, babe? You look exhausted.” The truth was half the time she didn’t look ok. Her beauty always covered the fact that her mind and emotions were one hundred and ten percent exauhsted.From what I don’t know, but I had been planning to figure it out.
“I just need to wake up a little,” she yawned. I sat down on the sofa next to her feet.
For a second I worried that she wasn’t happy to see me. That maybe in those 5 days I had been away she had forgot about me and found someone else. But the truth was she never looked truly happy. I’ve seen her pretend but never had I seen a real, lively gleam be drawn from her eyes. I remembered first seeing her.

She grabbed my hand and led me up the cream-carpeted stairs to her bedroom. The first door on the left. I took in all the details of her room I had missed. The walls of her room were completely blank and painted pure white. Her princess-like bed was covered in bedspread of espresso and champagne colors. All the mahogany wood on the matching furniture looked as if it had all been polished. It was almost like a hotel room, so clean and in a way empty. It felt hard to believe that this room was lived in, that it had been home to someone for 15 years. The window in front of it was cracked open so the cool mid-November air flooded in, adding a chill to the room.
I shut the door quickly and grasped Natalie’s neck with my left hand, I held her face with another. I kissed her cherry red lips softly and warmly, which is what I wanted the whole time we were apart. I want to touch her soft skin and kiss her.
Her lips tasted very strongly of Coke, her lips were cold and tingly. It was almost like I was drinking the carbonated liquid. I picked her up and layed her down on the bed, kissing her once more before I sat down next to her.
“How has school been?”
“Okay, kind of boring. It’s been raining a lot here.” She paused and pushed her side bangs out of her eyes.”How was California?”

Love the idea! This is really cool and descriptive, you’ve got me hooked ha ha, i want to read more!
Just be careful not to repeat things. Also you changed the narrative from 3rd to 1st. It would be fine if you let the main guy describe her room and everything. But other than that great job! Keep up the good work!

??? Confused????????
He rejected me but still acts interested????
I met this guy about 2 months ago (im sublettin a room in his apartment) and during the 1st week, he asked me out several times. He asked me go to a graduation party with him, to see a movie, to go for ice cream, and to accompany him on a road trip to D.C. with him (about 6 hrs from us)….all within the first week….i rejected most of it but agreed to go for ice cream so we did….since then, we’ve hung out at the apartment lots, just hanging and talking about any and everything….we’ve gone to the movies, out for ice cream again, and i’ve accompanied him on random errands….we watch tv 2gether at home and have cuddled several times (his arms around me, playin w/ my stomach, rubbin his hands up and down my arms, holdin hands, his head in my lap…things like that..very innocent)….

every now and then, he’d make random comments about meetin my parents and such….once, we were talkin about things we want to do in the future and he’d include me in his future….so i figured, somethings goin on here…..

so after 2 months, i finally decided, i’ve got to know what’s goin on here b/c nothing has really been spoken in terms of our relationship to one another….so this morning, i asked him…i said that lots has been implied but nothing has been said so i was confused about our relationship…and i asked if we were just friends or dating or in a relationship or what….

he said, that we’re just friends….and that he doesn’t think a relationship between us would work….

I’m confused about this b/c his actions clearly say otherwise….and he even looks“googly eyed”when he looks at me…i don’t understand…am i wrong to think that he was interested….does he like me but just doesn’t want to date me?

Any opinions/suggestions would be helpful……

BTW, i’m christian and he’s not; i did randomly mention once when we were naming what we looked for in potential spouses, that mine would have to be christian…i don’t know if that’s the reason he doesnt think we’d work as a couple…that could be it…but my thing is, why lead me on all this time then?…..

He didn’t reject you. He wants to be your friend. You said everything has been“innocent,”so why can’t you leave it at that and enjoy your friendship?

Dear cuddly wuddly beary boo,

I don’t really know how to tell you this, but our socks don’t match. I think I realized it when I finally changed my underwear in your apartment and I saw you sit on your prized statue of Michael Jackson in the nude. I’m sure you’re shamed enough to understand that I get turned on only by garbage men. I’m returning your Hannah Montanna underwear and bra to you, but I’ll keep the results of that blood-sample as a memory. You should also know that confessed today about the moose poaching and you ruined my attempts at another world war.

Best of luck on the sex change,
Lucid

Do I have schizophrenia?
Ever since I was 10 years old, I have had some of the symptoms. Sometimes I will feel as if I am on top of the world, and other days I will want to do nothing, go under the covers, and just listen to my music or sleep.&lt;–apparently, that’s bipolar? idk. But anyways, the first time I had an episode of this disease is I was watching a movie with my parents. I felt like I was bleeding, (there was blood involved in the movie) I got really scared, and cried to my mom. She told me there was no blood, so I let it go. Recently I saw the movie Orphan, and she was stabbing the dad, I felt like I was being stabbed behind me. Usually when I am watching a scary movie, I feel like I am being hurt in some way. I also feel like people are behind me, or stalking me. One time I heard someone outside say the n*gger word, and I went downstairs and asked my parents if they heard it, they said no. One time I was watching a TV show late at night, I heard voices, but it wasn’t the TV. I turned it off, and I was okay. I turned the TV back on, went under the covers, and I thought I saw someones hands coming out at me, like they were trying to grab me. Nutrition is a very big deal with me, I won’t eat unless I am REALLY starving. Unless,of course(;, I am bored as hell. I’m 5’0, 13 years young, and I weigh 100 pounds. I have GAD, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, learning disorders, especially Dyscalculia. I hate bathing, and for some reason, I like the smell of body odor? My mom would wash my hair in the sink, and when I actually do smell good I get nervous, and sweat, which leads to BO. When I do see things, it’s usually out of the corner of my eye, and when I look it’s gone. One time I saw a“cat on the street at night, and my dad didn’t see it. I’m a bit of a pervert, I talk about sexual things, I laugh when people are yelling at me in a serious way ESPECIALLY my mom, like if someone is crying I will laugh realllly hard. I can’t help it, like when my friend fell off her bike in 5th grade, I laughed because I thought she said something about vanilla ice cream, and she was like“it’s not funny.”I guess she thought I was laughing about her falling. One time this girl was doing a presentation, I started bursting out laughing for no reason at all. It’s hard for me to cry, unless I get really hurt or anxious I will feel like people are out to get me. I laugh at nothing, everything, and anything. I’m a bit of a spaz attack, and I get annoyed and pissed off easily. I have ideas and thoughts of killing people, sometimes I want to step on people until there face gushes out blood. I’ve had that idea since I was about 9 years old, I’m pretty sure. I just want to know if that is the case or I am just ill? Idk. HELP?

Btw ;; I used to cut myself, and I think I’m fat and I’ve tried to not eat for a while. I have exercised to the point where I got very dizzy, and my whole body hurt. I’ve looked at myself in the mirror before, and hated what I saw. I have a counselor, i’m going to talk to her about all of this sooner or later when I have the guts to, haha.

Please read this and give me feedback?
Chapter one
I finished the last of the vanilla ice cream, and I turned off the TV. This afternoon at the beach my boyfriend for 2 years broke up with me because he met someone else. I loved him since Middle school. And he broke my heart by text and I have been watching romantic movies ( like that would help) and eating ice cream the whole day. There was a bunch of tissues on my bedroom couch from all my crying.

My ex-boyfriend has short black hair with brown eyes and is 5’6 and 2 cm

My name is Alexis Shield and I’m a freshmen at Lesley park high school. I have light blue eyes with brown wavy hair with side bangs, I’m 5’5, and I just started high school 3 weeks ago. Thinking it would be the best possible. I have a lot of friends and I passed two test with flying colours but my boyfriend broke up with me and I thought this was only the beginning.

The next morning I got on my school bus and sat next to my best friend Lily. Lily has straight dirty blond hair and one strick of hair is always a different colour today was yellow. She is 5’6 with hazel eyes.

”I heard the news.”Revealed Lily.

“Already?”I asked.

”Yeah I’m sorry that Blake broke up with you I heard he is going out with Olivia now.”She mentioned

”I should have known.”I hissed.

Just the other day Olivia Dryden went up to Blake and started to flirt with him. But me not being a person who needs to know what her boyfriend is doing every second wasn’t scared of him going out with her because I didn’t think he would. Olivia hated me and I hated her every since 5th grade when she kissed my crush on the lips and I swore revenge and I got it one day in 6th grade Olivia started liking a guy named brad and I dated him for all of 6th grade but then came a long handsome Blake and he ask me out so I answered yes I mean who wouldn’t say yes to his gorgeous brown eyes, but anyways Olivia and I had been fighting dirty all these years and Olivia always gets the upper hand she is the most popular girl in the grade and every guy is always drooling over her but she consistently harasses other girls, just so she can feel good That’s high school who would have known?

The bus arrived and I ran off to meet up with Abigail. Abigail has red curly shoulder length hair with blue eyes like me and is about 5’2 she is the smallest in the class but she doesn’t really care.

“ Hey Abby I heard you need tutoring in science .” I assumed

“ Wow news travels fast in this school.” She advised

“ Yeah trust me I know.” I chuckled.

“ But yep I need a torture.” Abby Admitted

“ Well I could be your tutor Science has been my best subject since first grade and last year I got all A+ through each semester.” I bragged

“ That’s great! It’d be better to have a friend as a tutor than some random person.” She Implied

“ I assume that’s a yes I’ll meet you at the library tonight a 6.” I insisted.

As I walked in the school hallway over to my locker to get my books. I heard whispering and snickering about “ Alexis this Alexis that.” I started to get annoyed and tried to ignore it but what made it worse was when I passed by Olivia’s locker and saw Blake and Olivia talking and giving romantic looks. When Olivia saw me she glanced over and gave me a dirty look. I knew Olivia was only doing this to make me mad and sad at the same time and it was working but even I wouldn’t steal someone’s boyfriend even if I did hated them for over 4 years. That would be rude and horrible to someone who had a two year relationship. But obviously Blake couldn’t see through those fire flaming eyes. Olivia has straight strawberry blond hair with layers and forehead bangs she has natural light blond highlights. She had brown eyes and is about 2 cm taller than me.

When the bell rang for every one to get to class I was the last to get in. I wanted to avoid “ The Rush.”
I slid into my seat to find a note attached to my desk writing this:

Dear Alexis

Are you happy to see how great a couple me and Blake are! You were a great couple too when he was your boyfriend but we make a better couple! So how is your sucky life going huh? I am I making it miserable ?
Well at least you still have your dignity. But remember your never going to make it far in life with me around.

P.S feel under your desk.

From: Olivia

Olivia threatens me and harasses me but I’m not scared of her so she took my boyfriend away but I don’t need a boy to complete my life. I felt under my desk to find my hand stuck to Olivia’s gum. What a pleasant surprise I jerked my hand and shook the desk a little and got my hand off of her gum. When a small note fell on the floor. I picked it up with my gummy hand thinking it would still be from Olivia but it wrote something more friendly:

Dear: Alexis

I Admire you so much so I wrote you a poem:

Roses are beautiful
And so are you

Mountains are magnificent
And so are you

Nature is the world
And my world is you

Please go to t

Your plot sounds pretty good so far, but your writing style needs a lot of work. Go back and edit for grammar mistakes, especially punctuation. There are missing commas and periods all over the place. Also, try not to talk to the reader so much. For example, you say“My name is Alexis”. Try to tell us things like her name and her friends’descriptions and so on in a different way. It makes the story better to read. Or, if you want to talk to the reader, you can use a“dear diary”kind of style. Reread it, that’s the best way to spot mistakes. And be critical of yourself. That’s the only way to make your writing better. Good luck with it!!

What does my dream mean?
Well yesterday I was really tiered so I watched a little TV and fell asleep for about 5 minutes on the couch. Then my brother’s friend came over so I went in my room to sleep. I woke up about 8:30-9:00 pm. I watched the movie‘Precious’with my mom and my brother. Then I went back to bed after having some ice cream and finishing off the book‘Go Ask Alice’.

Anyways, I tried to clear my mind and focus on making everything dark in my mind. You know how when you close your eyes and then everything is dark but there is like swirls and things like fireworks all over? I tried to get rid of those, but I simply couldn’t. So I laid there and finally I was out of it. All of 2 minutes later I am in‘dream land’and I start hearing strange things, and seeing demonic creatures everywhere. I specifically remember rolling off my bed-i actually have my mattress on the floor so it’s not a big deal, but i didn’t really fall off my bed only in my dream-and i turned to face the wall and my lights were on, and there was a sticker of a cat facing down. Then it looked at me and gave me this kind of angry look with red demon eyes. Then a few other scary faces appeared and I tried pinching myself to wake up, but I couldn’t because I couldn’t move, or open my eyes. Everything seemed so real. Ever since I haven’t been able to make any sense of it. I just want to know what the cat means symbolically because that’s the really only one thing that stands out.

Also, I have been having a lot of‘lucid’dreams. Where I can’t move or anything But my eyes are open? Or something I can see my real room or the real surrounding I’m in but I can’t wake up. And I can’t scream or anything. Like I’m paralyzed. And they are always scary. Why? It’s as if I have much more nightmares than real happy dreams. Or my dreams are sad, or weird. Why?

my assignment; crime short story. Please READ!?
English Narrative

okay i REALLY need help with this story for english, im in advanced english and im 14.
iv sort of been neglecting this story as iv been writting others.
Also we can ONLY write the complication and orientation.
I need advice

Alice stepped out onto the wet pavement; she inhaled the slightly humid night air. Shadows were cast along the street walls from the sidewalk lamps and passing cars. In one swift movement she turned the key in lock of the door. Clutching her laptop under her arm she moved onto the sidewalk, flagging down a taxi to take her to 376 GreenFort Apartments, Oxford, England.
***
Alice was startled by the bang at the door, it had been early morning and she hadn’t expected anyone.
“Coming” called Alice in the direction of the door, but before she had time to open it herself, her neighbour from the flat next-door bustled in. Her appearance was neat and meticulous, her white curly hair slicked back into a bun. Her face was ancient, deep lines where set in her forehead, like small ripples of water frozen in time. She smelt strongly of perfume, almost sickly sweet she’d thought.
“Can I help you, Mrs Dally?” she questioned, as she begun to drift around the room, gathering her things. She pulled a black coat over her cream long sleeved top, and ran her fingers through her short dark brown hair.
“I was wondering when my antiques would arrived, the ones I had ordered last week from the store?” claimed Mrs Dally, her plump figure stood in the doorway blocking the light, her stance suggested she was demanding. She was extremely impatient thought Alice.
“I’ll pick them up for you at the store and drop them off to you by the evening…Mrs Dally I’ve got to go now, I’ll see you later then?” Alice didn’t have time for her neighbour and she was late to catch the bus to her antique store in Riedford. She brushed passed her and headed for the door. Leaving Mrs Dally flustered and annoyed in the doorway.
***
The streets where lively and busy, local businessmen and women rushed through the streets, with a comforting coffee and bag in hand. Alice tidied her small antique shop which was filled with little miscellaneous items and Chinese antiques. She looked out her shop windows, the rain last night had dried up and the sun now beat down on the pavement. Across the small walkway she saw Lei’s Chinese restaurant, her shop was colourfully decorated in traditional lanterns and objects. The colours contrasted so greatly against the dull buildings it seemed odd- or perhaps out of place. Alike her store she had no customers all morning. But by late evening there’d been one customer; if you could call it that, which had came to Alice’s antique store.
***
Mrs Dally hated waiting all alone in her small flat, it wasn’t preferable, and she constantly felt claustrophobic. As she paced around the house pulling open old windows, she was oblivious to the grey sky that would soon bring rain to the town. Alice should have been back soon with package she thought, but where was she? She contemplated this and many other things while the TV hummed comfortingly in the background like a light lullaby.

She woke to the ear piercing screech of a car, dazed and disorientated she abruptly sat up. She’d fallen asleep on her old rocking chair and her spine ached from the awkward pose she’d slept in. Mrs Dally fumbled with the lace curtain to peep out into the street, only a dim light spilled onto the street from Alice’s flat. It had been too eye straining to see much more than a blank canvas. She trudged down the hall to her bedroom at the far end of the flat, and switched on the small lamp by her bedside. She noticed the window she’d left open earlier in the day, and was disgruntled by the water that now stained her wood floor. The rain lightly trickled down onto her peeling and cracked window still, diluted in the water had been some sort of red liquid. She looked at it puzzled and as she turned for a cloth her eye caught the butchered dark red body of her now lifeless neighbour; Alice.

This is actually really impressive.
I didn’t read all of it, but I got the gist of your writing technique from the first few paragraphs.
It flows really nicely, and you don’t go out of your way to describe things. I could easily picture in my head what was happening, and the vocab was nice.

Well done

Could this be aspergers in the 4 year old I watch?
I nanny a family with 3 children and the oldest is 4 year old girl who has odd traits. I just started a few months ago but the very first day I met her I noticed some of them. I was wondering if this was Asperger’s or if she will grow out of it and if I should say anything to the parents.

ODD TRAITS:
-She sometimes talks in 3rd person (instead of saying“I want some ice cream”she will say her name wants some ice cream ((sarah wants some ice cream))

-She will repeat herself sometimes
and ask me a question and I will answer, then she will ask me the same question again right after and I will answer the same and she will ask it again…and I’ll get annoyed and asked her the question and she will say the answer I just said (hope that makes Sense).

-I’ve only seen her to a weird hand thing one time but it wasn’t flapping it was like tapping her fingers together (only one hand)

-She is very picky about clothes Always has to wear dress because“she will be too hot”socks are impossible to make her wear, its flip flops.

-Sometimes its hard to get her attention when she is watching TV.

- when she gets hurt and I ask her what happened..she either cant or wont tell me what happened.

-Also When she has to go to the bathroom EVERYTIME..she will be like“I have to go to the….”and I say go where? she will say“go….”and it could go on and on and she would never say it..until I do..then I’ll say“you have to go potty”and she will be like“yeah I have to go potty”

Could Grow Out:
She doesn’t have a problem with eye contact as far as I can tell
I haven’t had the chance to see her interact with other children besides her 1.5 sister. And with her she is just kind of telling her what to do, sometimes physically making her do what she wants, at times she will be mean to her but its just seems like sisters to me.
She knows most of her alphabet and one day we could go to the park next museum (she doesn’t have a problem with changing her daily schedule)
 
 undir says: July 30, 2011 at 5:34 pm 
None of what you described sounds to me like typical Asperger’s symptoms or traits. I doubt that she has it.

Most of what you describe sounds like a normal 4 year old to me, but if you are concerned you could gently voice your concerns with her parents and tell them what you’ve observed. Don’t make it sound like you are trying to diagnose her with something though, just mention what you’ve observed and voice your concerns that you think something might need to be looked more into to make sure she is developing normally and learning appropriate behaviors and speech.

He rejected me but still acts interested????
I met this guy about 2 months ago (im sublettin a room in his apartment) and during the 1st week, he asked me out several times. He asked me go to a graduation party with him, to see a movie, to go for ice cream, and to accompany him on a road trip to D.C. with him (about 6 hrs from us)….all within the first week….i rejected most of it but agreed to go for ice cream so we did….since then, we’ve hung out at the apartment lots, just hanging and talking about any and everything….we’ve gone to the movies, out for ice cream again, and i’ve accompanied him on random errands….we watch tv 2gether at home and have cuddled several times (his arms around me, playin w/ my stomach, rubbin his hands up and down my arms, holdin hands, his head in my lap…things like that..very innocent)….

every now and then, he’d make random comments about meetin my parents and such….once, we were talkin about things we want to do in the future and he’d include me in his future….so i figured, somethings goin on here…..

so after 2 months, i finally decided, i’ve got to know what’s goin on here b/c nothing has really been spoken in terms of our relationship to one another….so this morning, i asked him…i said that lots has been implied but nothing has been said so i was confused about our relationship…and i asked if we were just friends or dating or in a relationship or what….

he said, that we’re just friends….and that he doesn’t think a relationship between us would work….

I’m confused about this b/c his actions clearly say otherwise….and he even looks“googly eyed”when he looks at me…i don’t understand…am i wrong to think that he was interested….does he like me but just doesn’t want to date me?

Any opinions/suggestions would be helpful……

BTW, i’m christian and he’s not; i did randomly mention once when we were naming what we looked for in potential spouses, that mine would have to be christian…i don’t know if that’s the reason he doesnt think we’d work as a couple…that could be it…but my thing is, why lead me on all this time then?…..
 
 Barbarella says: July 30, 2011 at 5:54 am 
Harsh lesson babe, boys can be badly behaved.

He is getting all the fun of a relationship and his emotional needs are being met, without the commitment.

In a way this is worse than him having sex with you and not wanting a relationship. His way of being friends is very full on and I think you should set some boundaries for him if that is all he wants.

Then get on with your life, see your friends and spend less time with him. Best of luck xx

What do you think?
Recently my best friend for many years and I got in an argument. I started yelling and he said“Don’t talk to me like you talk to your mom”then he also said“I don’t think we’re best friends anymore, we’re growing apart”It killed me, Imagine your BEST FRIEND telling you this, anyway I sent him this email today, what do you think…

My shoulders hold the pressure like the bottom of the ocean, it weighs too much on my emotion, It’s like I’m paralyzed, I don’t want to move I’m hypnotized, I try to fight it but it pushes and squeezes tears out of my eyes, I just hide it no one knows, sees or could realize, I’m sick of everybody and every thing, don’t want to think about what tomorrow will bring, cause it’ll just be more bullshit, 14 years now my moms been sick, there’s strains on every one of my relationships, so now where does this lead me, to my best friend tells me were not best friends anymore it kills me inside believe me, before you judge me please hear me out, I hold this **** in but now the truth I shall shout, I am not perfect there is no doubt, sometimes I speak harshly even to my own mom, It is something that I am not fond, but you must understand we have a bond, so what you see and hear it goes far beyond, for we hold an ocean you just see a pond, Imagine your mom waking you up at 4 in the morning hardly breathing, gasping and wheezing, my heart starts pounding, but I have to stay calm, if my composure dies then so does my mom, cause you see the more relaxed she is, the easier to breathe, inside i’m scared to death with shakin knees, But on the outside I’m collected so that’s what she sees, outside is calm, place her hand in my palm, inside I’m thinkin where the hell is the ambulance, holding the panic in is like stopping an avalanche, I wish you could have been there with me at least one of those nights, helplessly watching as my mom struggles and fights, just for air, it’s just not fair, within a year my parents got divorced, my dad moved away, my brother went into the Navy, me and my mom stayed, then she got sick, and I got scared, it happened so quick, my life started to end then and there, what once was an average family of four, became just me and her bedridden and poor, from gt’s and tv’s, to foodstamps and welfare, from Ice cream and popsicles, to regular ambulance rides to hospitals, from glad with mom and dad, to home and all alone, It finally got so bad, we were not gonna make it, we had to move close to family, we just couldn’t take it, so we sold our car, packed a uhaul and hit the road, Imagine moving across the country at only 16 years old, my friends and I huddled and cried, that day another small part of me died, music was what got me through the dark nights, someone stole my whole book of cd’s out of the cab of the uhaul that night, the bad thing is that it was one of my“friends”, what a goodbye, way to make amends, homeless and broke, friendless no joke, not even music to help me cope, but I did have my mom, a radio and the open road, a truck and us two bearing a heavy load, we had to use most of the money to get a room in Flagstaff,’cause her asthma acted up that fast, she barely got through it and we were ok, then we got a flat tire the very next day, staying at random relatives houses on the way, we were gonna make it no matter what you do or say, we arrived in Indiana December 2007, the groud blanketed with snow it looked like heaven, we stayed at relatives houses’til we got on our feet, I started a new school alone consumed with defeat, I went to a school where no one knew me, everyone seemed to look right through me, then I finally met a good group of friends, they helped more then they’ll ever know in the end, helped to ease some of the depression, it meant the world they made an impression, mom was still sick and takin new meds, they made her hallucinate and messed with her head, so now I get wakened not only by lack of breathing, but also by her running in my room screaming, through all this **** I always made it to school the next day, my eyes drooping, so tired, head starting to sway, but I had new friends to help me find a way, gave me a reason to be, a reason to breathe, so i guess what I am trying to express is don’t look at me and just see what you see, cause you didn’t walk in my shoes, you never drove down my highway, I have no excuse for what I choose, I just do it my way, cause I’ve been all alone since I was 13, you could never know of the hurting, the many nights that I hid and I cried, the nights that the kid in me died, cause I was forced to grow up too quick, get so depressed that I throw up so sick, so before you rush to judge me or my mother, open your eyes get out from under the cover, and if you happen to tell your best friend they’re not, understand that you may be all they got, anyway that is ALL TRUE, if you know me you know I would not lie to you, so don’t ever question any thing with me and my mom, that’s how we are and you are so wrong, and if you aren’t my best friend then I guess it’s so long.
 
 myluvstefan says: July 30, 2011 at 11:24 pm 
dont listen to all these people- your poem is your poem–it doesnt matter how long or how short it is. You have been through a lot and if this is the way you can express it- then this is what you should send to your friend.

And if your friend is truly your best friend, then he/she will understand. And more than that, they will realize how much you put into this poem just to make amends w/ him / her.

these are your feelings–dont let other people change them. I think your poem was great- it had so much emotion and it truly brings tears to my eyes. I’m sorry you have had a rough road…i have asthma too–and my mom has asthma–i have had it since i was 3. and well, my mom got it soon after my parents seperated and she got a new boyfriend- But the thing is, the night my mom had her first asthma attack–it freaked me out too- however, her new boyfriend didn’t understand. He told me and my brothers to go to bed. How could he be like that? you know, he literally threw my younger brother on the bed.. and it just wasn’t that great. I told my mom i wasn’t leaving her…and i didn’t care what he thought about it. My life wasn’t so amazing after my parents seperated either- but dont give up. I know its hard. but in the end, everything will always work out.

God Bless. And great poem- keep writing.

is this good writing?
i’d been writing this. well my lil sis. lemme kno if it’s good and what it improve:

On the Verge of an Angel, Devil, Or Mortal

I was sprawled on the cream couch, inspectin my glistening black nails. My wings ached from playing Heavenly Attack during Gym yesterday. I lay upside down and glued my eyes toward the blank plasma TV screen. I didn’t feel like graduating today. No more friends, no more fun or good times. After today and on, I’ll have to go to some dumb country down below the ground of clouds. I’ll have to watch over the country, grant human’s wishes if they deserve it, make sure if they’re doing some good or bad, blah blah, but no more heaven, tommorow I will be an official Angel. I didn’t want my angel-in-training life to end.
“Eat some delicious rasberry custard tarts that I just whipped up, and get going to school,” ordered my mother as she slammed the platter of pastries and a mug of hot cocoa onto the coffee table placed in front of me. I rolled my eyes and continued to be motionless. Seriously, I feel like we’re nothing alike, she absolutely beautfiul, with her big gorgeous blue eyes and wavy strawberry hair that falls down right above her waist with a petite body unlike me, I have dark eyes and long midnight black hair. I am more of a devious yet stylish clutz and she’s a perfectionist. “Don’t be a procrassinator like your father, Chloe ….” mom reminded me. I suddenly sat upright.
My dad never met me, but my mom told me all sorts of stories about him and how he was courageous,clever and handsome, who’s an angel in Russia, and liked to push things till later. I feel like it’s all a lie, and how he probably is a distgusting sneaky hustling mortal. And my mom is probably telling all these tall tales to make her and myself feel all better.
As I absentmindely bit into the delectable tarts, I started to ponder about how my dad probably is ending up now. I put down my breakfast and made a break to the front door, without a goodbye.

I burst through the doors of the Graceful Wings school. Dumb name, right? The students
checked out my outfit, nodding approvingly but a scared expression was spead across their delicate faces. I had a reputation here and angels always thought I would turn out to be a devil.
I flew with speed, kind of embarrassed,toward my friend,Chelsea’s, locker. Angels around here called us the double C’s. “Hey,” I spoke with a gleeful tone, hiding the sad one.
“Hey, what’s up?” she replied, smacked her colorful locker shut. Without a word, she dropped her textbooks in my hands and started to apply ballerina cherry lipgloss on her tight lips, without letting me answer. “ So what country are you going to after graduation?” she questioned out of nowhere. I winced, the question I despised. I shrugged and handed her books back.
“See you later,” I mumbled as I vividly sped to Cooking class before that tiring late bell rang.

Chelsea and Dana, my other friend came over my house after school. Dana is not as pretty but she’s hilarious and has a bubbly personality. So anyway they came over my house and we did eachother’s hair, makeup, and all that beautifying stuff. We were getting dolled up for our graduation. I tried to make our fun last. We started use our powers and lifted powder in midair and flinged it at one another. At the end of our fight, we glanced in the mirror. I looked like I just rolled in golden sand. I giggled nonstop with them.

The shining moon risen and full. I could feel it barely touching my pale skin. I was wearing all black and red. My mom complimented saying I looked nice but I knew she didn’t like my dress and makeup. I tugged my curled hair and bit my deep red lips. I felt like mini angels were flying in my stomach.

It is interesting. You can improve the grammar, which is an easy fix.

The first sentence I noticed was this:“Eat some delicious rasberry custard tarts that I just whipped up, and get going to school,” ordered my mother as she slammed the platter of pastries and a mug of hot cocoa onto the coffee table placed in front of me.”I would rearrange the statement of the mom so it flows better. Maybe remove the“that I just whipped up”part.

Eye creams are formulated to target the area under the eyes. The best ones will reduce dark circles, crow’s feet and the bags under the eyes caused by water retention among other things. Under eye creams are supposed be the revolution in aging care that you are looking for.

I&apos;ve tried many products over the years and I hope what I have found will help you to find the best under eye cream faster than what it took me. I would try one product for 3 months straight to give them a fair chance.

Happy Days

Amber
