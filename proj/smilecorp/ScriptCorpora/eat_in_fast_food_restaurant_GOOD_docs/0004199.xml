		FAST 
 GROWING&amp;LUCRATIVE MARKET   
 Chicken King continues to enjoy rising consumption 
 and popularity as the meat of choice in Asia. It is a cost–effective 
 and healthy staple dietary item in the region. It is also a 
 highly competitive sector filled with traditional fast-food 
 franchises like Kentucky Fried Chicken, Popeye’s, Church’s, 
 Texas Fried Chicken. The Hamburger and Pizza chains also responded 
 to the increasing demand by introducing chicken based products 
 to their core menu. Market research reveals that chicken based quick-services-restaurants 
 (QSR) franchises will continue to dominate the growth sector 
 in the food and beverage industry. Chicken King has a 5 Step Strategy to gain market share in this fast-growing sector: 
 1. 
 More Variety. More Value. Better Taste.™ 
 
Each and every stakeholder in Chicken King, beginning from 
 the franchisor and master franchisee right down to the delivery-people 
 make a commitment that they will strive to ensure that customers 
 agree that Chicken King has delivered on its promise of….. More Variety. More Value. Better Taste.™ 
 
 2. 
 A Comprehensive Site-Selection Criteria 
 
All franchisees are given tools and techniques to evaluate 
 the suitability of a proposed site. The site selection criteria 
 should be adhered to in order to serve Chicken King’s 
 pre-defined target market.
 
 3. 
 Healthier Alternatives 
 
We are focused on attracting customers who prefer healthier 
 options. We offer an increasingly popular range of set meals 
 that cater to the health conscious. Our Chicken King Roasted 
 Chicken coupled with home-styled side dishes and king-size 
 fresh fruit juices will impress any calorie counter!
 
 4. 
 Saturation Point? 
 
Some believe that a number of international fast-food franchises 
 have reached saturation point. Interestingly, research also 
 reveals that the average consumer will frequent one fast-food 
 restaurant 8 times a year. This trend may give room to new 
 quick-service-restaurants like Chicken King to gain market 
 share. Chicken King will firmly position itself as an exciting 
 and interesting alternative to traditional fast-food franchises 
 (As one of our customers put it“We can’t eat 
 KFC every month, can we?”). Our goal is to make Chicken 
 King the“Preferred Alternative”to traditional 
 fast-food/QSR concepts.
 
 5. 
 Chicken King’s 3 Pillars of Marketing 
 
Our marketing philosophy is based on two facts. Firstly, 
 we are a new and fresh brand (which means we have less resources 
 and brand loyalty). Secondly, we need to win customers over 
 from our big competitors (which means we have to always 
 try harder).
 The Three Pillars of Marketing are:- 
 I Community Outreach 
 
All franchisees are required to carry out projects which 
 will help reach out to the community they live in. The franchisor 
 will disseminate monthly community outreach programs. The 
 objective is to encourage the neighborhood to use the restaurant 
 as a meeting point.
 
 II CK Pre-schoolers Club™ 
 
This club is for children from 3-7 years old. The franchisee 
 will carry out a series of activities targeted at this group. 
 The franchisor will produce its own unique toys and learning 
 materials under Chicken King license or under co-branding 
 from suppliers.
 
 III CK Kids Club™ 
 
This club is for children from 8-12 years old. The franchisee 
 will carry out a series of activities targeted at this group. 
 The franchisor will produce its own unique toys and learning 
 materials under Chicken King license or under co-branding 
 from suppliers.
