 Sixth grader dies from car accident injuries 

 By Yadira Betances , Staff writer The Eagle Tribune Wed Oct 03, 2007, 09:38 AM EDT 
 
 LAWRENCE - Friends of 11-year-old Dario Rodriguez gathered after school yesterday to mourn his death from injuries suffered in a car accident the day before.

&quot;I saw him, said &apos;Hi&apos; and 30 minutes later he was gone,&quot; said Dario&apos;s cousin, Eduardo Martinez, 14, a freshman at Lawrence High School. &quot;I&apos;d have preferred it to be me rather than him, because I loved him so much.&quot;

Dario was hit as he crossed busy Route 114 (Winthrop Avenue) at 4:48 p.m. Monday. He died yesterday at 6:48 a.m. at Massachusetts General Hospital where he had been on a respirator with severe head injuries.

Dario was crossing the street to Sullivan Park near Veterans Memorial Stadium with two other children after getting a drink at a fast food restaurant. He had been thirsty after playing basketball in the park.

The driver of the car, James Gianni of Lawrence, was heading east toward North Andover on the four-lane road when the vehicle in front of him slowed down to let the children cross, police said.

Gianni told police he did not have time to hit his brakes; swerved into the right lane to avoid the car and struck Dario.

Dario&apos;s mother, Viviana Resto, gave birth to a baby girl three weeks ago named Niriani Pena. Resto also has another son, Melvin Velasquez, 14.

Resto stayed overnight at her son&apos;s bedside at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The boy&apos;s father, Dario Rodriguez Sr., arrived from the Dominican Republic yesterday, but was unable to make it to the hospital before his son succumbed.

Family members and friends said Dario, a sixth grader at South Lawrence East, loved to play soccer and basketball, and dreamed of being a professional player in either sport. He also enjoyed school and was a whiz at social studies, and knew where a slew of countries were located on a map.

As word of Dario&apos;s death spread, fellow students from South Lawrence East, neighbors and friends stopped at his aunt&apos;s North Parish Road home near the stadium.

Dario&apos;s aunt, Rubi Perez, was not surprised to see the group of 15 youngsters at her home.

&quot;It shows you how much he was loved,&quot; said Perez, who received a telephone call telling her about Dario&apos;s death early in the morning.

&quot;I&apos;m still in shock,&quot; said Perez, fighting back tears.

Dario&apos;s best friend, Ariel Torres, 11, recalled the good times the two had playing basketball and watching &quot;Drake and Josh&quot; on Nickelodeon. &quot;Thinking about him makes me sad because I miss him,&quot; said Ariel, a sixth grader at South Lawrence East School.

 

&quot;I feel horrible because that was my best friend and now he&apos;s dead. I can&apos;t believe it,&quot; said Angel Curet, 12, a seventh grader at South Lawrence East.

&quot;He was the kindest, friendliest and most respectful boy,&quot; said Esmeralda Rodriguez, a neighbor of the family on North Parish Road near Veterans Memorial Stadium. She said Dario seemed to be playing soccer every afternoon with his friends.

A group of female students from Lawrence High who knew Dario through his brother, Melvin, witnessed the accident while sitting at Wendy&apos;s restaurant.

&quot;My heart dropped and I was numb,&quot; said Ashley LaFlamme.

William Sullivan, principal at South Lawrence East, said grief counselors were available yesterday and again today and for as long as students need to express their emotions about the accident.

&quot;He was your average sixth grade boy,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;A very nice boy whom everyone liked.&quot;

Police Chief John Romero said the accident was still under investigation and was unsure if more charges would be brought against Gianni, the driver of the car.

He was ticketed for driving 40 mph in a 30 mph zone.

&quot;Because of the severity of the injuries and the possibility that the accident could be fatal, we brought in the accident reconstruction team from State Police,&quot; Romero said. &quot;We&apos;ll wait on that report.&quot;
