How is taking a date to McDonald&apos;s being&quot;cheap&quot;but a coffee shop isn&apos;t?
 Based on what I&apos;ve read here (and even heard from women I know)....

The general consensus of taking a woman to McDonald&apos;s for a first date lunch/dinner makes the guy seem&quot;cheap.&quot;The general thought of meeting for coffee (chain or local place) is seen as an acceptable venue.

Let&apos;s break this down when Jack meets Jill for a first date in two scenarios:
At McD&apos;s, She orders an Angus burger upsized meal AND has an ice cream sundae. Cost is about $7.
At Caribou Coffee, she orders a coffee drink for $3.50.

So, in this scenario, Jack just spent twice as much at McD&apos;s than he would at Caribou Coffee yet he is considered&quot;cheap&quot;for taking her to McD&apos;s?

And I&apos;ve been to some McD&apos;s where they have fancier wood trim to make the place look less&quot;plastic&quot;and a little nicer. So, it really isn&apos;t about ambiance.

Please help me sort through this fiscal dilemma my dearest GS associates (and those who wander into this forum).

 We got weed at our Coffeeshop, so she&apos;d be very, very mellow.

Rule of thumb though, don&apos;t take her anywhere, where you can have a children&apos;s party.

 A coffee shop looks much more professional then a fast food resturant would. Fast food resturants are for quick on the go meals while coffee shops is a place to sit back and relax with a nice coffee. At least thats what I think. The women also probably doesnt want to&quot;gain to much ascess weight&quot;from the high calorie food served at mcdonalds.

 It&apos;s not that it&apos;s cheap but it&apos;s not very romantic sort of.
I went out once with a guy to McDonald&apos;s and I had no problem with it knowing that he is in college with me so we need to be tight on money...Although I would have preferred just coffee because we can talk instead of trying to figure out how to eat big Mac!

 It isn&apos;t cheap, based solely on the amount spent. Women who see it as cheap probably just consider it appropriate to pay significantly more for a meal than for a cup of coffee.

 McD&apos;s also has coffee, btw. Limit her to getting a coffee or tea, and she should have no problem with it.

 I don&apos;t consider going to McDonalds as cheap. Actually it&apos;s better because you get your food faster lol, but I don&apos;t eat at McDonalds anyway since I&apos;m a vegetarian. Burger King does have a veggie burger though lol.

Actually McDonalds is only a little less than the food at Applebee&apos;s or Fridays.

 Because when you go out for a coffee, you get to talk and get to know eachother.
When your in McD&apos;s your stuffing your face on fast food- not really attractive for a first date is it?

If you really want to take her somewhere to eat, then choose somehwere like the olive garden or something more fancier.

 Because in some sense McDonalds is seen as trashy
It&apos;s sort of low class

Now somewhere like Starbucks or another coffee shop, it looks classier. Its also jus coffee so it&apos;s a laidback date

Answer mine?

 Math or money calculation does not pierce the thick curtain of prejudiced/wrong perception. McDonald is considered as fast food restaurant&amp;cheap ($1 items are available if you like). Coffee shop or Restaurants are not considered as cheap and they are not branded as fast food eateries.

 When you make a comparison you need to compare like with like. Comparing a MEAL at McDonald&apos;s with only a DRINK at Caribou Coffee is not comparing like with like.

 Why do you care? Take her out for coffee, if that&apos;s what she wants, and use the savings to buy yourself a burger later.
