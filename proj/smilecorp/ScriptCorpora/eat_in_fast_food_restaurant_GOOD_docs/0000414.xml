 indrep33 Why do people get mad when I ask for an ID for their debit cards? 
 I work at a fast food restaurant, and we accept debit and credit cards. Whenever I ask for ID and someone is paying with a debit card, they get mad and say&quot;Well,it&apos;s a debit card,why do I need ID?&quot;I guess it&apos;s because they think they need to type in their pin,but that&apos;s not always the case. Every card swipes as credit on our machine,even if it&apos;s a debit. It&apos;s because you have to enter that it&apos;s debit manually, and we never do that. Therefore, there&apos;s no need to put in the pin. So, if that same person&apos;s card got stolen, and we didn&apos;t ask for ID, a thief could use their debit card. But the customers still get mad. But it&apos;s for their own protection and to prevent identity theft.                 Reason for Reporting

 Working in retail, I experience this on near daily basis. I get people who get angry at me for asking for ID when their card says&quot;Ask for ID&quot;, or if they&apos;re only buying a small amount, etc. Bottom line, if your card isn&apos;t signed or if I can barely see the signature, I&apos;m asking for ID. First of all, many credit card thieves first start purchasing small things to see if they can get away with it, so I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re only spending $1, I&apos;m asking for ID. Second, it&apos;s *against* the terms and conditions of any credit card to leave it unsigned...even if you put&quot;See ID&quot;or some variation of that. Merchants could rightfully decline any unsigned card. Credit cards REQUIRE a signature. I&apos;m so sick and tired of people saying that they don&apos;t sign their card so they don&apos;t have to worry about theft. It&apos;s MUCH more difficult to forge a signature than to sign someone else&apos;s name with your own handwriting on an unsigned card. People have lost all common sense. I remember walking in a grocery store and finding someone&apos;s unsigned card on the floor. I turned it in, but imagine what fun I could have had if I was dishonest. All I&apos;d need to do was sign her name with my handwriting.

This is for the consumer&apos;s protection. If that person ever had their card stolen, they&apos;d be wishing they never got upset for being asked for an ID.

 You are doing the right thing. Never mind the objection-voiced ones.

 There is nothing you can do about it to prevent their anger. All you can do is explain why your asking for it.

Seeing that you are the one thinking about their ultimate safety dont get offended with their reaction and know that your doing a job well done! 
 
 jenniferm626 
 They are just jerks. They just need to complain about something and were inconvenienced by u asking. Ignore them and don&apos;t let it get to you. Kill them with kindness and maybe they will think about getting that stick permanently placed in their behind surgically removed! 
 
 bugged 
 Just say&quot;I&apos;m sorry but it&apos;s for your own protection&quot;, smile, and leave it at that. I&apos;ll bet most will smile back and say thank you!

 Because it&apos;s really not necessary unless the card is NOT signed.

(1) Visa and MasterCard rules forbid retailers from asking for photo id as a condition of sale. In other words, retailers can ask to see a photo id, but the customer is under no obligation to show it. As long as the transaction is processed correctly and approved electronically, the retailer can&apos;t decline the transaction if the customer refuses to show an id. (It&apos;ll be interesting to see how long this rule lasts).

(2) The cardholder is not liable for fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, if the retailer processed the transaction correctly (including looking at the signature), then neither is the retailer. Fast food restaurants don&apos;t have to worry about chargebacks (refunding money to the cardholder whose stolen card was used) so long as the transaction was authorized and the price was less than $25. (A signature isn&apos;t even required at fast food stores for a purchase less than $25 anymore.) So it&apos;s not like your store owner has anything to gain by asking for ID.

(3) Asking for ID probably won&apos;t prevent identity theft. It might prevent an identity thief from using a card issued in someone else&apos;s name (but sent to the thief who used a stolen social security #) in a store. It would probably be a pretty stupid identity thief who used the card that way. Far better for them to charge away on online marketplaces where no one checks IDs.

(4) Lastly, most card thiefs don&apos;t waste the few opportunities they have to use a stolen card before it&apos;s reported and shut down by buying a value meal. They generally head straight to stores like Best Buy, where they buy gift cards and other readily salable items as fast as they can. The grocery store, oddly enough, is also becoming a hot spot, since so many of them now sell gift cards.

Asking for an ID probably doesn&apos;t do any harm. But it really doesn&apos;t do much good. And since it&apos;s supposed to be fast food, that&apos;s probably why customers get annoyed at having to take the extra step. 
 
 thanks to our brave troops, 
 i wonder they same thing i work in a hotel and i do to i try to tell them that it is for their own safety,,, you think they would say thank you,, no they get pissed because they have to show id,,
gee maybe the next time it won;t be them using the card it will be a stealer,, and no one will ask,, they will find out the hard way one day,,, i love it when i am asked,, at least i am safer that way,, so everyone who works with cards should ask and not get mad when we do,,,

 I happen to prefer the added check -- especially if I don&apos;t have to enter my PIN. However, I do know a lot of people who claim that if they know their PIN, and it&apos;s a debit card, then they shouldn&apos;t have to be ID&apos;d. I happen to disagree, though.

Hopefully word will get out to those who get upset so that
they&apos;ll understand and stop getting angry.

 They get mad for several reasons, but you are completely right in asking for ID.

They get mad because
- they feel like you don&apos;t trust them
- they have to get another card out
- it&apos;s something that slows them down, even for 3 seconds
- they DON&apos;T realize is for their own good

Ironically, if someone stole their card and used it, the first thing these same people would say is, didn&apos;t the store even check for ID?

Next time they get uppity about it, just say&quot;well, what if someone else was using your card, would you want me to check then? 
 
 sexytrojan 
 Because they are IDIOTS!

Like you said, you are doing it for their protection. What logical reason would someone have to get mad for that?

On the other hand, why don&apos;t cashiers ask for ID when it says&quot;Please request ID&quot;on the back of the card. 
 
 sideways 
 Thank you. I personally thank every person who asks me for my ID as it is so easy to steal anothers identity. 
 
 FreeDom 
 Because they are lazy. 
 
 Erin S 
 Just explain it is the restaurant policy and it is in place to protect customers from fraudulent charges. 
 
 STEVEN F 
 Don&apos;t take it personally. Many people these days would get mad if you asked if&apos;George&apos;was really an woman&apos;s name. Some of them are only&apos;happy&apos;when they are mad at someone. 
 
 dawn18417 
 HEY if they don&apos;t like it they should be using cash. 
 
 ♥Popotitozz♥ 
 People are so ignorant, don&apos;t worry you are doing the right thing. 
 
 Shred Guy 
 Thanks for helping protect all of us even if some people don&apos;t appreciate it. 
 
 First Lady 
 I wouldn&apos;t worry about it! I think there should be a law that requires a photo ID with EVERY credit AND debit card purchase even if a pin number is used. That would stop a lot of the theft and fraud going on. I think it should be harder to use credit/debit cards not easier. I used to work in retail and I understand what you mean! These people can&apos;t understand that you&apos;re really doing them a favor and they should be thanking you instead! 
 
 Mariposa 
 They don&apos;t like to be hassled by having to take out their id. (Plus people have bad photos they don&apos;t want to show off.) I actually like it when people ask for my id. If someone were to take my card and had to show an id, the id probably wouldn&apos;t match, so at least one fraudulent purchase was denied. 
 
 **** Starling-Designs**** 
 well no wonder, you wouldent want someone asking your debit card number. Or whatever. but yeah i do get ur point !
