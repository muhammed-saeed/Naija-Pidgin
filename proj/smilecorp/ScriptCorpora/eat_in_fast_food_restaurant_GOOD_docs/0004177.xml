Franchise Solutions’ Business Directory Features New Sub&amp;Sandwich Restaurant Concepts
 Togo&apos;s Sandwiches and Submarina California Subs joins the Franchise Solutions Food&amp;Restaurant opportunities directory. 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
   Submarina California Subs&amp;Togos Sandwiches Franchise Opportunities PRLog (Press Release) - Dec 18, 2009 -
Subs and sandwiches have become the go-to choice for a growing number of health-conscious, busy people looking for a quick meal that’s nutritious and delicious. In addition to being convenient, subs and sandwiches are also easy on consumers’ waistlines and their wallets. Restaurant franchises that are known for offering fresh subs and sandwiches are thriving and many are expanding their franchise networks. Franchise Solutions’ business directory features food and restaurant franchises ( http://www.franchisesolutions.com/ restaurant_franchise_ op... ), like Submarina California Subs and Togo’s Sandwiches, which specialize in subs and sandwiches, and provide prospective business owners with the opportunity to own a business that attracts a wide audience.

The Submarina California Subs franchise ( http://www.franchisesolutions.com/ franchise/Submarina.cfm ) opportunity offers would-be franchisees the chance to become part of the burgeoning quick-serve sandwich market and own an SBA-approved franchise. Submarina has been a leader in the sandwich business since 1977 and franchisees benefit from the company’s proprietary recipes and products. Submarina sandwich breads are delivered fresh to the stores and Submarina meats, cheeses and condiments are of premium quality. Wraps, salads and soups round out the menu and Submarina franchisees can offer catering services, which lets them tap into the multi-billion dollar catering industry.

In QSR magazine’s Best of 2008 issue, Submarina was voted “Best Franchisee Support” and RestaurantChains.net ranked Submarina second in their list of the “Top 20 Fastest Growing Concepts” (for the period between 4/21/08 - 7/20/08). Submarina franchisees don’t need to have restaurant industry experience as they receive in-depth training and support from an experienced team that has over 100 years of combined franchising experience. The support team provides franchisees with assistance in numerous areas including site selection, lease negotiation, store design, permitting, construction and marketing.

Togo’s Sandwiches ( http://www.franchisesolutions.com/ franchise/Togos.cfm ) is another SBA-approved sandwich concept that originated in California in the 1970s and has developed a loyal following. Togo’s franchisees enjoy the advantages of owning a business that has instant, built-in brand loyalty and recognition. Togo’s sandwiches are made with fresh baked bread, the highest quality vegetables and premium meats. Since the sandwiches, wraps, salads and soups served at Togo’s locations are made with fresh ingredients, there are no hoods, fryers, grills, or grease required, which makes it a simple restaurant to operate. The average Togo’s location is between 1,200 and 1,400 square feet, which also contributes to the concept’s ease of operation.

Togo’s franchisees receive a complete business package that includes management and restaurant training, restaurant development assistance, site selection and restaurant design support, access to purchasing systems, marketing assistance and materials. Ongoing support is provided from an executive management team with over 150 years of combined restaurant experience.

Additional information regarding the Submarina and the Togo’s Sandwiches franchise opportunities, as well as other food and restaurant concepts can be found in the Food and Restaurant franchises section of Franchise Solutions’ online business directory.
