Logo Designs and Brand Storytelling

A logo speaks volumes. Think about the following logos that you may encounter daily: Coca-cola, McDonalds, Facebook or Google. Can you easily identify these logos by their typeface, font size, colors or image? Can you quickly recognize these logos? Do they elicit a certain type of emotional response? For example, if you&apos;re traveling on a deserted highway and pass a McDonalds sign, you may feel a sense of comfort. You may stop to eat at the fast food restaurant because you trust the brand and know what to expect.

 Company Storytelling 

A business logo serves as a company narrative. Building your brand with a powerful logo is like telling a story to your audience.

 Will customers be persuaded to buy your products and invest in your services? Does your brand and business logo evoke feelings within your customers? Does your logo inspire and reflect your company&apos;s history, traditions or goals? Are you targeting and effectively reaching out to your audience? What do you aspire your company to become? What is your vision? 

Consumers connect to businesses through logos. Think of the logo as the main character in your company&apos;s story. When consumers see your logo, are they reminded of innovative products or are they filled with emotion?

For example, when consumers see Apple Inc.&apos;s apple with a bite taken out, they may associate the logo with groundbreaking technologies and revolutionary electronics such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod. Also, Walt Disney&apos;s &quot;Disney&quot; script may create consumer feelings of cheerfulness, innocence and joy.

What kind of story do you want to tell? Who&apos;s telling it and who&apos;s going to listen?

Tribute to Company History

Properly designing a logo demands company reflection, competitor research and understanding your target audience. Your company&apos;s history is a great starting point. Think about your company&apos;s timeline, origins and how you got to where you are today.

The logo of sports car manufacturer Ferrari is symbolic of the Italian fighting and racing heritage. The Ferrari logo features a symbolic Prancing Horse above &quot;SF&quot; script on a yellow background. SF stands for Scuderia Ferrari and the logo represents the company&apos;s passion for sports cars, racing and speed. Count Francesco Baracca, an Italian ace fighter pilot during WWI, had the Prancing Horse symbol on his plane. After Baracci died, Italian race car driver Enzo Ferrari inherited the symbol in 1940. The historic symbol was used on his racing cars and is still recognized by race car fans today.

In addition to your company&apos;s history and tradition, other ideas include:

 Using company colors Focusing on a specific company value or philosophy that has special meaning Adopting a symbol that relates to your industry 

Key Points

As you choose among logo designs, keep these two guidelines in mind:

 Branding your company isn&apos;t one-sided. It is a collaboration of your values and goals, as well as the opinions and attitudes of customers and clients. Your logo is no different. Branding and your logo form a relationship with your consumers. Your business logo should be designed as a timeless emblem. As your business grows, the market relies on your logo for recognition. Only change your logo to draw attention to a company shift or expansion in your products or services; otherwise, it disrupts the relationship loyal customers have with your brand and company.
