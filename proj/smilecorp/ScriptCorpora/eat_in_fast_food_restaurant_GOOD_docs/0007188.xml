		Jollibee 
 


 Jollibee is a phenomenal success story: what began as a two-branch ice cream parlor in 1975 offering hot meals and sandwiches became incorporated in 1978 with seven outlets to explore the possibilities of a hamburger concept. Thus was born the company that revolutionized fast food in the Philippines. 

 In 1984, Jollibee hit the P500 million sales mark, landing in the Top 500 Philippine Corporations. In 1987, barely 10 years in the business, Jollibee landed into the country’s Top 100 Corporations. It became the first Philippine fast food chain to break the P1 billion sales mark in 1989. In 1993, Jollibee became the first food service company to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange; thus broadening its capitalization and laying the groundwork fo r sustained expansion locally and beyond the Philippines. 


 Undisputed leadership 
 As the country’s leading fast food chain, Jollibee has grown exponentially on all aspects on operation. From a handful of stores 32 years ago, Jollibee now boasts of more than 600 stores and over 50 international stores. 

 Expanding market coverage 
 To achieve its long-term goal to be the country’s food service leader, Jollibee acquired Greenwich Pizza in 1994. A year later, the company obtained the franchise of Delifrance, an international food company. These moves expanded Jollibee’s penetration in the pizza-pasta and French caf � -bakery segments. In 2000, the strategic acquisition of Chowking solidified the company’s position as the dominant leader. The move gave it leadership in the Oriental quick-service restaurant segment. 
 
 Recipe for success 
 Jollibee’s rapid growth is due to its superior menu line-up, creative marketing programs, and efficient manufacturing and logistics facilities. It is made possible by well-trained teams that work in a culture of integrity and humility, fun and family-like. 

 As a corporate citizen, Jollibee is also committed to give back to its host communities through meaningful and lasting socio-civic projects. 

 A triumph for and of the Filipino 
 Jollibee dedicated its continuous success to the Filipinos who have been there from the very start. 

 Jollibee is so well-loved everytime a new store opens, especially overseas, Filipinos always form long lines to the store. It is more than home for them. It is a stronghold of heritage and monument of Filipino victory.

 A HISTORY OF GIVING 

Jollibee has had a long history of giving back to the community. With its involvement in worthwhile projects like Sa Aklat Sisikat, a reading program; Nurture the Future, a community-based feeding program; the Values Program of the Department of Education; and Habitat for Humanity, Jollibee has continually shown its commitment to building happy children and communities.

 A FUTURE OF JOLLIFYING 

With the establishment of Jollibee Foundation in December 2004, Jollibee, along with the rest of the Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) hopes to make giving back an organized corporate commitment. It aims to invest in people and help them succeed in the way Jollibee knows how. This meant taking the values, the system, the tools, and the years of experience that has made Jollibee what it is today and sharing it with the people they most ascribe their successes to: the everyday Filipino.

Every program the Foundation embarks on is done the Jollibee Way—grounded on the values that have endeared the brand to millions of Filipinos. These values are Customer Focus, Excellence, Respect for the Individual, Teamwork, Spirit of Family and Fun, Humility to Listen and Learn, Honesty and Integrity, and Frugality. These are the very values passed on from corporation to employee to customer that result in what the Foundation likes to call“jollifying”.



Jollifying is a commitment to go beyond set responsibilities, others’expectations, even beyond oneself to make a lasting impact for the greater good. When a Jollibee Foundation project results in happier, more capable people able to forge a better quality life for themselves and those around them, then the Foundation has truly jollified the community.



 OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

Jollibee’s social commitment went further when it embarked on projects with Habitat For Humanity Philippines and Give-A-Life Charity Foundation. It also launched its own meaningful programs such as “Sabi ng Jollibee, Kaya Mo Kid!”, “MaAga ang Pasko”, “Nurture The Future”, and the hiring of hearing-impaired crew members.

For the first time, Jollibee, Greenwich, Chowking, and Delifrance took part in Pabahay Pambuhay, a poverty housing project initiated by the JFC Group for Habitat. Under this project, employees volunteered to act as fund-raisers and promoters. In a sign of solidarity, senior executives and employees worked side by side with beneficiary families in building Habitat Houses. This fulfilling experience has led the Jollibee group into assuring Habitat of its continued support, making a long-term commitment to help build not only homes, but also hope for a better life.

With the “Sabi ng Jollibee, Kaya Mo Kid!”, JFC realized its corporate thrust of developing the potentials of children through an inspiring public service program that promotes positive values and creativity. The art-oriented campaign won for itself the coveted Grand Anvil Award from the Public Relations Society of the Philippines. The Award is considered the Oscars of Philippine public relations. 

 

 
Jollibee and its long-time spokeperson Aga Muhlach share the passion for the welfare and development of underprivileged children. Out of this mutual passion, the “Ma-AGA ang Pasko sa Jollibee” was born. It is now the longest-running gift collection drive in the country.

JFC, together with the NGO organization called STEAM Foundation, Inc (Special Training, Employment, Advocacy and Management, Inc) launched the hiring of hearing impaired personnel in its stores through the initiative of its celebrity endorser, Aga Muhlach. To this day, various stores employ hearing disabled people.

Jollibee Foods Corporation, in partnership with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and a nonprofit organization called Kabisig ng Kalahi, is actively involved in a nationwide supplemental feeding program dubbed Nurture the Future. Launched in January 2001 the project feeds undernourished children in 35 squatter communities around the country. More than 600 children have“graduated’from the program with over 400 currently being fed.

Jollibee donated financial assistance raised voluntarily from company employees to Give-A-Life Charity Foundation, which aims to raise funds for the purchase of desperately needed life-saving medicines and hospital equipment for indigent pediatric patients. Jollibee continues to support the Give-A-Life Foundation for the children of PGH. 

 

 Company and Brief History 

 Jollibee is founded by Filipino-Chinese Tony Tan Caktiong and hisfamily began as a two-branch ice cream parlor in 1975 at Cubaooffering hot meals and sandwiches. The original company name was Jolibe then Mr. Lumba next reformed the name Jolibe to Jolly Beeand made the two words form a single name Jollibee.Their success is phenomenon.

They have the concept of Servetime constrained customers, good quality food, clean diningenvironment, having a low price and give convenience to thecustomer.Almost 15 years when Jollibee entered the industry but they rapidly became successful to other fast food that came first. It was incorporated a 100% Filipino company 1978 with seven outlets toexplore the possibilities of a hamburger concept. 1979 is theintroduction of Spaghetti Special. 1980, First TV commercial waslaunched by Jollibee, Chickenjoy and French Fries are launched andit is the introduction of Jollibee mascot debuts. Then Jollibee PalabokFiesta’s introduction was 1982. In 1984, Jollibee hit the P500 millionsales mark, landing in the Top 500 Philippine Corporations. Theirfirst international venture was at Singapore by 1985 and theyalready have 31 stores by 1986. In 1987, barely 10 years in thebusiness, Jollibee landed into the country’s Top 100 Corporations. Itbecame the first Philippine fast food chain to break the P1 billionsales mark in 1989. In 1993, Jollibee became the first food servicecompany to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange and the newMain Office site has been moved to Jollibee Centre Building inOrtigas Center, Pasig. By 1994 he got Greenwich for Jollibeeexpansion into the pizza-pasta segment and by the end of the yearthere has been already 148 Jollibee stores nationwide. By 1995 Jollibee acquires franchise of Delifrance and Jollibee successfullyopens stores abroad: Guam, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,and Jeddah, and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. By 1996 By the FarEastern Economic Review Jollibee has been cited again as one of theleading companies in Asia having cited it last 1994 and on the same year Mary’s Chicken was born last July 10. It is a semi-self service 

 

 restaurant and another Jollibee subsidiary it is also in the same yearof launching of Jollibee’s Amazing Aloha, opening of first Jollibee inHongkong and the launching of the project Maaga ang Pasko sa Jollibee and Chikiting Patrol: at Home Ako Dito. These projects’mainobjective was to protect and contribute to the development of theFilipino children. By 1999 Jollibee opened 50 stores nationwidewhich makes a total of 350 stores and Cheezy Bacon MushroomBurger has been introduced to its line of specialty burgers. By 2000,31 more Jollibee stores opened, bringing the total to 381 stores and Jollibee obtains Chowking Foods Corporation, Asian BusinessMagazine ranks Jollibee as the Most Admired Company in thePhilippines and the 3rd over-all in Asia, surpassed only by globalgiants General Electric and Microsoft and reaching a systemwidesales of P20 billion. Jollibee also acquired Red Ribbon Bakeshop on2005, another popular fast-food restaurant in the Philippines. In2006, they acquired the Délifrance which further expanded itspenetration in the food service industry particularly in the Frenchcafe-bakery, a growing segment of the Philippine food market.And until now Jollibee Corporation is continuously expanding andthey already acquired Mang Inasal last Oct. 19, 2010. It was theircompetitor in their chicken product, but now it is one of their sistercompany. It is now part of Jollibee Food Corporation. Among all thefast food chains here in the Philippines, the Jollibee FoodCorporation is considered to be the most popular choice among allthe Filipinos. The Jollibee Food Corporation has been serving us withtheir delectable collection of fast food 

 

 

 service and cleanliness offered by Jollibee is an advantage.Restaurants are not as quick as a Jollibee QSR which is anadvantage for Jollibee having a superior service, and finally, Jollibee prices are reasonably priced that is has been a pinoyfavorite. All Filipino will love Jollibee, if a new Jollibee branchwill be build Filipino wait until it will open and patronize it. The threat of substitute products is considerable. Local streetfood and high-end restaurants form two ends of a range of substitutes. Potential entrants face entry barriers that willhinder them from entering the industry. These are theinability to gain access to technology and specialized know-how, brand preference and customer loyalty, capitalrequirements, economies of scale, and strategically situateddistribution channels. But Jollibee can overcome with this. Anew substitute for Jollibee product will be hard to enter to theindustry and compete with Jollibee. 

 

 c.Bargaining power of buyers 

 Bargaining power of consumers- high, the customer firstpolicy shows it all. The summary of the competitive forces show that the industryis highly profitable. Competition within the industry is highand is centered on marketing and product innovations. Thecustomer is the key sector for any QSR and their say shouldalways be considered. Jollibee has appealed to the marketwith its product and service offerings, together with thereasonable pricing strategy. This has helped in Jollibee being acountry-known brand that the threat of substitutes is low.Finally, the supplier’s control over Jollibee is low; there isalways a room for integration with the amount of cash of thecompany and the pool of technical people in the country towork for them.Even Jollibee will change the price of their products Jollibeesales are still high and will not be affected, they have loyalcustomer and will still buy their products. 

 

 d.Bargaining power of suppliers 

 Bargaining power of suppliers- low, though some rawmaterials are imported, the country’s stock of technically 

 

 skilled people can do the job for Jollibee in case it tries tointegrate. The level of technology of the commissariescontributes to the standardization and maintenance of qualityof food products. Also, trade barriers that limit the amountimported to the country is an appealing reason to integrate. This lessens the bargaining power of suppliers. 

 

 e.Intensity of rivalry among competitors 

 As Jollibee entered international markets, it faced newchallenges. The fast food industry is highly competitive andprice wars and marketing innovations are seen frequently. The rivalry is also centered on the key success factors of theindustry, which are good food, good, service and reasonablepricing. Rivals are somewhat equal in capabilities andopportunities, thus making the competition stiffer.Internationally well-established players like KFC andMcDonalds had high brand values that Jollibee found difficultto compete with. McDonald’s is also known for its best locations/ sites. Tough competition between existing establishments such asMcDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Wendy’sas to the quality of food, service time and menu variations ata low price.But Jollibee successfully competed with their great strategiesand the service like “Alagang Pinoy” that they give to theircustomer and other competitors don’t have this kind of service. Having also now a big corporation and acquiring othercompanies to be their sister company can really compete. Their strategies of acquiring their possibility competitors orthreats to their company made their success. 

 

 Summary of the dynamics of the industry 

 

 Fast food popularity begins 1960’s and the pioneers of this areRay Kroc – McDonalds and Colonel Sanders - Kentucky FriedChicken. They have the concept of Serve time constrainedcustomers, good quality food, clean dining environment, having alow price and give convenience to the customer.Rivalry started as a local happening. Competitors in thePhilippine fast-food industry are both international (KFC andMcDonald’s) and local (Wendy’s and Shakey’s) companies. For theinternational market of Jollibee, it has the same rivals such asMcDonald’s and KFC especially in the US market.A fast food restaurant or Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) has the following 3 characteristics. It is characterized by its fast food cuisine and minimal table service. It offers limited menu, cooked in bulk inadvance, kept hot, finished, packaged to order, and available totake-out, drive-thru, and dine-in. It is usually a part of a chain orfranchise operation, which provisions standardized ingredientsand/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurantthrough controlled supply channels.McDonald’s is one of the most famous QSR in the world.McDonald’s was founded by Mac and Dick McDonald – theMcDonald’s brothers in 1937 (Kroc 1987). It was once closed in1948 and reopened a short time later with a radically different kindof operation – a restaurant with the minimum service and menu, theprototype of fast-food units that later would spread across the world(Kroc 1987). ‘Hamburgers, fries, and beverages were prepared onan assembly line basis, and, to the amazement of everyone (Kroc1987: 70-71)’. It has been developed under management andleadership of Ray Kroc and expanded its market and became one of the world giants of QSR (Kroc 1987). 

 

 McDonald’s became No.1 in every country of more than 100countries in the world (Watson 2006) except Philippines where JFChas been overwhelming strength against McDonald’s (Kleinfelder2004: 37).On the other hand, JFC was founded by Chinese-Filipino Mr. Tony Tan Caktiong (TTC) as the ice-cream parlor at Cubao City in 1975.30 years after its foundation, it has grown up to a huge first foods 

 

 conglomerate in Philippines. It gained No.1 popular company inPhilippines for years.At present, its operation is not only domestic but also overseassuch as U.S.A., Brunei, Hong Kong, Guam, Vietnam, Middle East,etc.. JFC offers first foods such as hamburger (Champ and YumBurger), fried chicken (Chicken Joy), pasta (spaghetti), sandwiches (Jolly Hotdog), desserts and beverages, etc. and it is the most popular QSR in Philippines 

 

 FSC Standards 

 Jollibee’s phenomenal growth owes much to its strict and committed adherence to high standards as symbolized by“F.S.C.”: Food (F) served to the public must meet the company’s excellence standards or it will not be served at all; the Service (S) must be fast and courteous; and Cleanliness (C), from kitchen to utensils, must always be maintained. Jollibee is proud of its employees who carry out their jobs. 

 

 Jollibee recognizes them by providing the highest compensation and benefits packages in the fastfood industry, and modern and comprehensive training programs. Managers are regularly updated on the latest store operations systems, people-oriented management skills, among others. Service crews are trained on various store stations and food-service innovations. Jollibee also offers career opportunities for qualified and exceptional crew members to further their food-service careers as managers.

Store operations are ably supported by professionals who are experts in Marketing, Computer Management and Engineering.
