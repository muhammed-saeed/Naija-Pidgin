The food really is white trash fast food, greasy, salty and had probably been just heated up. Whilst one of our waitress was attentive and friendly the other waiter who served us was anything but. The food just plain and simple awful and defiantly not value for money.

Stumbled upon this place by very happy accident. The food was great -- I had breaded white asparagus with potatoes and an amazing hollandaise sauce, and my partner had an amazing burger. There&apos;s outside seating and the inside (like the menu) has a lot of personality. Great drink list, too. Recommended!

White Trash Fast Food is a big place with quirky decor. The place used to be a chinese restaurant and it shows.
The drinks menu has anything and all the drinks we&apos;ve had here have been delicious (celery g&amp;t, regular one, harvey wallbanger and white lady), they also have wine, beer, shots, coffee, fresh juices, you name it. Drinks are... More

Strange thing to pay entrance fee to get in to the restaurant. They told us it was due to a discjockey playing. That wasn´t true. Instead they show soccergame on big screen. Disappointed.
Food was ok. Big portions but nothing to write home about. Lot´s of better restaurants in Berlin

I love this place. You need to book a table because it&apos;s always full. Their menù is funny, and choosing what to eat is an experience. They really fill the dishes, like if you move anything something will fall from it. I like also their cocktails, they do it nice and good. Love me some golden margarita. Beer is beer,... More

Was boss, sat at the bar and chilled for ages.
Staff are cool and the music ain&apos;t bad. Probably a good place to meet like minded people.
When you have finished maybe try going next door to last cathedral to get wasted.

The menu at this restaurant looks very nice, and I wish I could try some of their dishes - but the BBQ beef ribs are so great that I always&quot;have to&quot;order them! They come with a delicious sauce, and with French fries.
My partner loves the burgers, and the house wine (white) is very good, too.

I saw this place transform from business/family style restaurant to full on night club. Great for friends and a night out. Super interior design.
