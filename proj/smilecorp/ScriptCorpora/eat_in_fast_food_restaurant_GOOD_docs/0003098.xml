KANNAPOLIS - Kannapolis Police arrested a Hardees employee on Tuesday for allegedly skimming money from the restaurant for over five months.

Randrea Katie Lynch was arrested for embezzlement after investigators said had been stealing money on a regular basis from the Hardees at 140 Dale Earnhardt Boulevard for over a 20 weeks period. 

Detectives joined in on the investigation with the Hardees Loss Prevention team on October 12.

Police have not said how much money was stolen, but said an estimate could reach thousands of dollars.

An arrest warrant was issued for Lynch on November 4.

According to police, she was released on a written promise to appear upon arrest. 

Lynch&apos;s first court day was November 10.
