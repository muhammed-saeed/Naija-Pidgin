 Transit of Venus 060612
 At eight minutes after five local time a tiny indentation
appeared on the outer edge of the Sun, it was the planet Venus as
it started it&apos;s trek across the face of Earth&apos;s nearest star. With a
diameter of 865,000 miles roughly thirty times bigger than Venus&apos; 7,522
or in comparison imagine a pea in front of a watermelon. KOZY / KMFY
has posted a short video of the“Transit of Venus”on it&apos;s Facebook
page and on You Tube at: http://youtu.be/aVKnnn5V6Hk .
An interesting factoid about Venus; it rotates backward, the Sun rises
in the West and sets in the East. Our Sun represents about 99% of the
mass of the entire solar system and the light emitted takes just over
eight minutes to arrive here.

Burning Restrictions Take Effect March 26 032012
 As the snow continues to melt and winds dry the dead standing
grass and brush the fire danger in most of Minnesota is expected to
rapidly increase. Because of the fire danger, the DNR will place
burning restrictions over much of the state beginning March 26th.
Spring fire restrictions limit open burning until summer green-up
occurs. Traditionally, most wildfires in Minnesota occur during April
and May. More than 95 percent of these fires are caused by human error.
The burning restrictions mean the state will not give out burning
permits for burning brush or yard waste. Counties in the
restricted zone in our area include Aitkin, southern Beltrami (that
portion south of Hwy. 1), Carlton, Cass and Itasca; however burning
restrictions take effect on the 26th over much of the state. For more
information, maps or to check fire conditions, visit the DNR web page

 Magnetation&apos;s reach across the Northland continues to grow.
Renee Passal of WDIO News has this report:
  
CEO Larry Lehtinen said that the company has purchased 730 acres
southwest of the Canisteo mine pit. The area surrounds their Jessie
Load Out train loading facility. That&apos;s where the proposed iron ore
pellet plant could be built. Or even possibly, a nugget plant,
according to Lehtinen. Also, the company has leased land north of the
Canisteo pit, for their fourth tailings to concentrate production
facility. The first plant is running in Keewatin. The second is being
built in Taconite. The third is a joint effort with Steel Dynamics in
between Chisholm and Hibbing. The Minnesota DNR said that Magnetation
has applied for a water appropriation permit, to take 1000 gallons per
minute maximum out of the Canisteo. The water would be for the plant
two site. Magnetation and it&apos;s partner AK Steel are considering three
sites for their pellet plant. Itasca County, Douglas County, and

 Snow Snow Everywhere, Not! 011912
 Today is Thursday January 19th, it is northern Minnesota and
there are communities begging for snow. Yet to the northwest in
Washington&amp;Alaska they have too much! The Grand Rapids Snow Folk
Festival and Ely&apos;s Winter Festival are suffering for the lack of that
frozen form of water. Not to mention the impact on snowmobile
enthusiasts. For the record the organizers in Ely are asking us to
bring clean snow in coolers, bags, boxes or by the pickup truck and
dump it near the wooden forms in Whiteside Park. If you would rather
not drive that far, drop it off at the central school or children&apos;s
discovery museum. By the way, although no two snowflakes are exactly
alike at the molecular level, the environmental factors involved in the
creation of a snowflake makes it improbable that anyone will see two
identical ones.

 Voyageurs Trail Condition Report 010512
 On Wednesday, January 5, the Purple Trail from International
Falls to Kettle Falls and the Yellow Trail from Ash River to Kettle
Falls opened due to improved ice and snow conditions. Hazardous
pressure ridges remain along the Green Trail on Kabetogama Lake. Staff
have re-routed the trail in some spots to provide a safer passage
through the pressure ridges. Due to frequent and extreme changes to the
pressure ridges, snowmobilers should use extreme caution and only cross
the pressure ridges at designated crossings along the staked
route.  Slow travel speeds are highly recommended. Snowmobile land portages have rough riding conditions due to minimal
snow cover. Park staff continue to find insufficient ice along the
Green Trail from Ash River to Crane Lake, requiring this section of the
Trail to remain closed. Please follow the snowmobile speed limit of 45
mph on frozen lake surfaces and 25 mph on all overland portages. Speed limit signs are posted at trailheads and overland portages. Regular weekly winter trail conditions reports are available on our

Cold Weather Septic System Problems 122911
 With little or no snow cover, Jack Frost may be nipping at your
septic system. Dan Olson of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency says
it may be a not-so-happy new year for some households if we don’t get
snow cover before temperatures really start to drop as the snow cover
helps insulate septic systems to keep them from freezing. Fortunately,
temperatures across the state have remained relatively mild so far this
season, but that could change any time. The University of Minnesota
On-site Sewage Treatment Program provides tips on how to prevent septic
system freeze-ups and how to deal with them when they occur:
 
  Place
eight to twelve inches of straw, leaves, hay or other loose material
over the pipes, septic tank and drain field. If the system is
frozen, don’t add cover now; it will delay thawing in the spring.  Use
water―the warmer the better―if you’re worried your septic system is
starting to freeze. Spread out your laundry so you run one
warm/hot load a day. Use the dishwasher and take hot baths. However, DO NOT leave water running all the time, as this will overload
the system.  Going
away for an extended period? Have someone use warm water in your
home regularly or have your septic tank pumped out before you leave.  Repair
any leaky plumbing fixtures or appliances.  Keep
all vehicle, animal and people traffic off the system. This is a
good rule to follow all year long, as compacted snow and soils cause
frost to go down deeper and faster. Protect especially the area
between the house and the septic tank. 
 If your
septic system freezes, call a septic system professional. The
M-P-C-A website includes a search tool for finding certified
professionals in your area.
For additional information about cold-weather septic system care, visit
the University of Minnesota on-site sewage treatment program website.

 Turkey Day News 112311
 Thanksgiving Day is a harvest festival celebrated primarily in
the United States and Canada. Traditionally, it has been a time to give
thanks for a bountiful harvest. While it may have been religious in
origin, Thanksgiving is now primarily identified as a secular holiday.
It is sometimes casually referred to as Turkey Day. In the United
States, it falls on the fourth Thursday of November.
The precise historical origin of the holiday is disputed. Although
Americans commonly believe that the first Thanksgiving happened in 1621
at Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is strong evidence for earlier
celebrations in Canada (1578) and by Spanish explorers in Florida
(1565). Thanksgiving in the United States was observed on various dates
throughout history. By the mid 20th century, the final Thursday in
November had become the customary day of Thanksgiving in most U.S.
states. It was not until December 26, 1941, however, that President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, after pushing two years earlier to move the date
earlier to give the country an economic boost, signed a bill into law
with Congress, making Thanksgiving a national holiday and settling it
to the fourth (but not final) Thursday in November.

Dayton Compromise 051911
 Yesterday Governor Dayton spoke to Minnesota’s budget and the
importance of compromise:
&quot;I made an offer on Monday to meet them halfway. That&apos;s the essence of
compromise. That&apos;s the essence of a divided government that we have
through the will of the people of Minnesota. But they also gave us a
shared responsibility to govern this state and lead this state. Sharing
means you don&apos;t get it all your way. It means that you compromise and
find middle ground. I offered to meet them at middle ground and I&apos;m
standing at middle ground waiting for them to understand that part of
the leadership is to work collaboratively with others who have been
dually elected to share that responsibility.&quot; - Governor Dayton
&quot;And that&apos;s the contrast between what I&apos;m doing, which is to protect as
much as possible those essential services and not raise property taxes
- as their bill would do by over half a billion dollars according
to the Department of Revenue. So they&apos;re raising taxes on everybody and
I&apos;m raising taxes on just the wealthiest 2% of Minnesotans.&quot; - Governor
Dayton responding to a question on the affects Republican budget cuts
would have on average Minnesotans.

reasonable, responsible middle ground.&quot;

Wildfire Destroys Barn 042611
 A grass fire east of Grand Rapids led to the destruction of a
barn and shed on the evening of April 21st even in the cool and damp
conditions that existed that evening. The landowner had burned about 1
and a half acres of grass near a barn and shed in an effort to keep the
structures safe. Unfortunately the fire got out of control and started
the barn on fire. Fire Departments from Bovey, Colerain and Grand
Rapids and the Minnesota DNR responded to control the blaze; however
the barn was totally destroyed. According to Ron Stoffle, DNR Wildfire
Suppression Specialist, grasses dry out very quickly in the spring.
Burning restrictions went into effect on April 15th in our area and
will go into effect in St Louis, Koochiching, Lake, Cook&amp;Lake of
the Woods counties on May 2nd. 

Zims Lane 042211
 The legal wrangling over Zims Lane has reached another milestone
early this morning. Judge Lois Lang issued a court order regarding
litigation concerning the 7 tenths of a mile portion of Zims Lane. As a
refresher on the issue, a property owner requested the county vacate
the portion that passes thru his property. Consuming many hours of
debate and resources of the County Board the issue ended before Judge
Lang in a lawsuit. The order states the County Board did not act in
contempt when they attempted to vacate Zims Lane but the order
continues by firmly requiring that the road shall remain open for
public use until a determination is made on the width and location of
Zims Lane and a determination as to it&apos;s status as a user road.

 WEB MNDOT Heroes 041111
 On Friday, Governor Mark Dayton spoke at the Heroes of Mn/DOT
event in the Capitol and honored Mn/DOT employees who have gone above
and beyond the call of duty in their work:
&quot;I want to thank and honor especially the honorees who are receiving
these meritorious awards - and you are true heroes. Michael Struck
exemplified the heroism, the dedication to duty, to acting
courageously, to protect the lives, save the lives of fellow
Minnesotans. &quot;
He was joined by Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel:
&quot;Today is our inaugural heroes of Mn/Dot program and we&apos;re recognizing
employees who have acted courageously or provided meritorious service
in response to dangerous or extraordinary circumstances.&quot;

WEB Dayton on MNDOT Projects 040711
 On Wednesday Governor Mark Dayton joined Commissioner Tom Sorel
today in kicking off the 2011 road construction season in
Minnesota. This year, Mn/DOT will be investing nearly $900
million in over 250 infrastructure projects across the state,
supporting thousands of jobs and making the improvements necessary to
keep our transportation systems safe and efficient.
&quot;The expansion of these number of projects that we can commit to over
the next decade are going to be crucial to our continued social and
economic vitality.&quot; - Governor Dayton
 &quot;About 25,000 jobs will be supported by these projects around the
state, both directly in the construction industry—those are private
sector jobs I&apos;ll point out again, a public investment that creates jobs
in the private sector—as well as those people employed going in their
communities and purchasing goods and services at the local stores.&quot; -
Governor Dayton
 &quot;I&apos;m committed to looking for ways, along with the Commissioner
and legislators, in the years ahead that we can increase the funds
available for these kind of urgently needed projects.&quot; - Governor Dayton
 &quot;In the end we&apos;re really trying to respond to the quality of life
that our citizens expect from us in transportation.&quot; - Commissioner Tom
Sorel 
 

Medicaid Cuts 040711
 Republicans push major cuts to elderly and the disabled in the
middle of the night
 Early Thursday morning, the Minnesota House passed a
proposal bill that makes significant cuts to services for the disabled
and elderly while eliminating thousands of private sector jobs in
hospitals and clinics.
 The House GOP proposal would repeal early Medicaid enrollment
which Governor Dayton signed via an executive order in January. The
result of this repeal would cost Minnesota hospitals and health care
providers billions of dollars resulting in the elimination of an
estimated 20,000 private sector jobs. In addition, over 105,000
Minnesotans would be added to the rolls of the uninsured. The repeal
would revert Minnesota to the severely underfunded triaged General
Assistance Medical Care program. The bill also rolls back cost saving,
bipartisan reforms passed in 2008.
The proposal also includes severe cuts to services for the elderly and
disabled. $46 million is cut from nursing homes and elderly services.
$228 million is cut from programs that allow the disabled to live
independently in their homes.
Despite making cuts with serious pain for elderly and the disabled, the
bill is not built in a fiscally honest manner. Almost $1 billion of the“savings”in the bill are unverified by non-partisan fiscal analysis.
In particular, $300 million in savings are booked from an unlikely
gamble that a Global Medicaid waiver would be granted by the federal
government. 

WEB Douglas Johnson Fund Raided 040611
 The Minnesota House of Representatives passed a bill cutting the
state’s jobs and economic development budget using a variety of
spending reductions and one-time fund transfers. Representative Carly
Melin of Hibbing says it is unfair to target 3% of the states
population to solve the budget deficit. Representative Tom Anzelc
joined the Iron Range delegation in aggressively opposing the
legislation that would steal $60 million from the Douglas J. Johnson
Economic Protection Trust Fund. The jobs and economic development
committee was given a target of cutting 58% from the 2010-11 budget.
Representative Carolyn McElfatrick broke ranks with the GOP and opposed
the bill. McElfatrick said that the fund was set up as an economic
development tool and that&apos;s how it should remain. The Republican
majority passed the bill on a vote of 70 to 60. The bill now will be
sent to a conference committee with the Minnesota Senate.

Dayton 032311
 On Tuesday Governor Mark Dayton signed House File 141/Senate
File 121 into law which increases the penalties for people who injure
or kill police or other public safety dogs.
&quot;To pass this legislation and say an assault on Major is an assault on
the integrity of our society and on the respect for law and order and
is a serious offense. It&apos;s something that&apos;s overdue and I&apos;m sorry if it
took this tragedy to bring that to recognition.&quot;
He also urged the legislature to join him in supporting aggressive
campaign finance reform by passing HF1099/SF631. 
&quot;So there is this whole 13-month period of time when policy makers,
legislators and members of the executive branch, myself included, are
making decisions and the public doesn&apos;t know where the political
contributions have been coming from.&quot;
Governor Dayton contends that citizens have a right to know where that
money has come from.

likely no water damage to the $100 million University of Minnesota
research lab in the mine. The fire&apos;s cause is unknown at this time. 

Franken Wants to Curb Speculators 031811
 A move to corral speculators trading in oil contracts and
driving up the price of gas at the pump picked up steam today as
thirteen US Senators joined together to press regulators for immediate
action and tougher regulation because new data shows oil trades by
speculators have jumped 35 percent since the latest round of civil
unrest began in late January in North Africa and then the Middle
East. During that same period, US gas prices have soared by
almost 40 percent. The senators joined Senator Al Franken in an effort
to rein in the speculators who are contributing to inflated oil
prices. The lawmakers sent a letter to Gary Gensler, chairman of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, asking him to use a new law
that gives tools to limit excessive speculation in so-called futures
markets. Franken said he is urging regulators to exercise
the authority they were given by the Wall Street Reform Act to clamp
down on the damage oil speculators are causing and help stem the rise
in prices at the pump.

Web Dayton Invasive Species 031711
 Governor Mark Dayton and the Department of Natural Resources
have revealed initiatives to prevent the spread of invasive species in
Minnesota’s lakes and waterways. DNR Commissioner Tom Landwehr:
“These are plants and animals that could drastically change the ecology
of our lakes and rivers, greatly threaten some of our infrastructure
such as locks and dams, and compose real problems for lake-shore owners
with docks with just the change of the whole ecosystem, change of the
fish structure of lakes.&quot;

He said the Governor is very supportive the effort to get ahead of the
problem and begin working on control measures. Governor Dayton
said an ounce of prevention is worth an unlimited number of tons of
cure:
&quot;I believe it&apos;s something that deserves and should have broad
bipartisan support. This is not a DFL problem, a Republican problem an
Independent problem - this is a Minnesota problem. It&apos;s a crisis
prevention strategy which is imperative.&quot;

He said we have a responsibility to ourselves, and to our fellow
citizens, and to our tourism industry - which is so vitally important
to the economy of Minnesota - and to our children and grandchildren.

REPORT ON ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND PERMITTING 030211
 The Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor released its
evaluation report of state environmental review and permitting
procedures. Senator Bill Ingebrigtsen, Chairman of the Senate
Environment and Natural Resources Committee, said the report on
Minnesota’s current environmental review and permitting procedures
reinforced what was known for quite some time that our bureaucracy is
costing businesses too much time and too much money. He said that
finding illustrates a failure of government to serve the people and
businesses of our state in a timely, effective manner. Last week the
legislature passed with broad, bi-partisan support a bill that
addresses many of the concerns brought forward in this report. Ingebrigtsen said they look forward to working with the legislative
auditor to continually improve the permitting reform process as we seek
to move at the speed of commerce and put Minnesota back to work. The
Senate passed a similar version of the bill, both of which go to
conference committee before going to the Governor&apos;s desk for signing.

Grand Rapids Fires 022111
 On Monday February 7th, the Grand Rapids Fire Department
responded to a kitchen fire at Mad Dog’s Pizza. The Mad Dog’s fire
caused significant damage to the commercial cooking area, creating a
temporary suspension in business operations. Workers were heating
cooking oil as part of their deep frying process when the fire erupted.
Shortly after 5:00 pm on Sunday February 20th the Grand Rapids Fire
Department was dispatched to a fire at the Hong Kong Garden Restaurant,
located at 1300 E. US Hwy 169. Upon arrival, fire crews were met
with heavy smoke coming from inside the building, and fire showing from
a vent near the roof area. Immediate evacuation of the approximately 20
guests who were staying at the adjoining Lakes Inn Hotel took place;
they were able to return to the building within the hour. Firefighters
were able to extinguish the blaze soon after arrival, and crews
remained on-scene for nearly two hours. As in the Mad Dog&apos;s Pizza
incident, this fire started as workers were heating cooking oil. Fire
and water damage was limited to the Hong Kong Garden Restaurant portion
of the building, while the adjoining Lakes Inn Hotel and the Island Bar
sustained minor smoke damage. Damage estimates could exceed $75,000.00.

Medical Assistance Expansion 021811
 Governor Mark Dayton announced that Minnesota has received
federal approval from the Centers for Medicare&amp;Medicaid Services
to expand its Medical Assistance program. Starting March 1st more low
income Minnesotans will be eligible for Medicaid benefits, which will
result in better care for more people and at less cost to the state.
Additionally this will save or create 20,000 jobs in our state’s health
care related industries. Governor Dayton said he thanks Kathleen
Sebelius Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services
for expediting this approval. Because of her, 95,000 Minnesotans will
receive better health care at less cost to our state. Under the
expansion, approximately 83,000 people who are currently enrolled in
two state-funded programs–General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC) and
MinnesotaCare–will receive MA, which provides more comprehensive
benefits and has lower co-pays. An additional 12,000 people who are
uninsured are expected to enroll. All are adults without children who
have incomes at or below 75 percent of the poverty level, about $677 a
month or $8,124 a year for one person. 

Dayton First Bill 021811
 Yesterday Governor Mark Dayton signed into law Senate File 139,
a bill related to online notification of EPA certified lead abatement
licensed contractors. Under current law, a building inspector must
prove that a contractor received their EPA certificate in lead
specialization by confirming their certification online. The EPA rule,
known as the Renovate, Repair or Paint rule states that any contractor
working on a house built before 1978 must be lead certified. Under
SF139, contractors have until August 1st to post their name on the
verified list, viewable on the Department of Labor and Industry’s
website. SF 139 had bi-partisan sponsors, and passed both the House and
Senate unanimously. This is Governor Dayton’s first bill signed
into law. 

POPULATION CONTINUES DECLINE 021811
 Minnesota’s moose population in northeastern Minnesota continues
to decline, according to results of an aerial survey released by the
Minnesota DNR. Dr. Mark Lenarz, DNR forest wildlife group leader said“These indices along with results from research using radio-collared
moose all indicate that the population has been declining in recent
years,”Moose numbers are estimated using an aerial survey. Based on
that survey, wildlife researchers estimate that there were 4,900 moose
in northeastern Minnesota. Last year’s estimate was 5,500. A study of
radio-collared moose in northeastern Minnesota between 2002 and 2008
determined that non-hunting mortality was substantially higher than in
moose populations outside of Minnesota. The causes of moose mortality
are not well understood. Of 150 adult moose radio-collared since 2002
in Minnesota, 114 have subsequently died, most from unknown causes
thought to be diseases or parasites. Ten moose died as a result of
highway vehicle accidents. Two were killed by trains. Nine deaths were
clearly the result of wolf predation. A copy of the aerial survey
report is available online at www.mndnr.gov/moose .

law changes and thereby ensure accurate tax returns. This is the first

and water damage to the attached house. Fire Chief Steve Flaherty said

    Not only is deer hunting a long standing
tradition in Minnesota but it is also a huge boost to our economy. Mark
Johnson, executive director of the Minnesota Deer Hunters Association
said deer hunting contributes almost seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars annually to the states economy. He said based on five
year old figures there are over fourteen thousand jobs in the state
because of hunting and the new figures are due out this year. The five
year old figures estimate each hunter spends, on average about eight
hundred dollars a year on hunting; however new estimates push that
figure up to between one thousand and fifteen hundred dollars. He said
to think of what that means to our community in terms of jobs, from the
venison processor to the clerk selling a hunting license. 
   As deer hunters sit in their stand waiting for the
perfect shot they often see other wildlife. Johnson said they
frequently get asked“What about the cougars in Minnesota?”He said the
short answer is that there aren’t enough cougars in the state to harm
the deer herd; however if hunters sight one that have a place to report
them. The Minnesota Deer Hunters Associations web site at
www.mndeerhunters.com and they have received a few sightings that may
be verified as cougars. He said trail cams have captured images of
several animals that may be bobcats or lynx. He said trail cam

each day after school. Amy Galatz, Principal at King Elementary
School, told board members children will not be left at a house when no
one is visible. The policy was in place but never implemented
until this year. Each child will also have only 1 drop-off
site. In other action, the board heard a report on the reading

members her department considers a lot of things before recommending a
price increase. Podpeskar told the board that the 20 cent
increase will still leave her department with an $8364 deficit this

Superior Publishing Corp. banner -- the Mesabi Daily News in Virginia,
Hibbing Daily Tribune, Grand Rapids Herald Review, Chisholm Tribune
Press, Walker Pilot-Independent and the Manney’s Shopper; as well as

Cemetery Vandals Arrested 061110
 A teenager’s attempt to claim a reward for information on the

planning to build a second Iron Range plant. The Nashwauk-based company
is raising $70 million to build and begin operating the plant southeast
of Taconite. The plant will produce 650,000 metric tons a year and

economic resource, but won’t be the last. 

Zims Lane
 A very confusing issue that won’t go away has turned up on the
Itasca County Boards table again; according to Commissioner Lori
Dowling a lot of debate has taken place on the issue of ownership of
the small lane in Wabana Township, Zims Lane. One individual wants the
county to vacate the portion of Zims Lane that crosses his property.
Dowling said Commissioner McLynn has expressed her belief that the lane
is not a county road however there are state statutes governing the
creation of public roads which may apply in this instance.
Commissioner Dowling indicated that sometime this summer a vote will
take place on the“vacation”of Zims Lane, which may be followed by a
lawsuit regardless of the direction of the vote. 

Jay Gould Mercury Testing
 How much mercury is in our local waterways? The city of
Cohasset is hoping to find out. Jay Gould Lakes haven’t been

318 realignment 052510
 Too many kids. It’s a problem many school districts wish
they had. At district 318, the over-flow of kindergartners last
year was followed up with a second year of more than expected
kindergarteners. The school board discussed the possibility of
realignment. 
The school board of Independent School district 318 met last
night. On the agenda was adding a kindergarten teacher to make it
eleven sections next year, instead of ten. But where that section
would go and who would teach it is the problem. Superintendent
Joe Silko told board members, parents and teachers there’s no easy
answer.
After his presentation, he suggested to board members and the public
that he might request an additional kindergarten and 1st grade teacher
for the fall and consider reducing a 3rd and 4th grade class to make
room.  That might mean twenty-seven students in third and
forth grade at Southwest will have a different school to attend next
year. 
 
Greenway/Nash-Kee Workshop 052510
 The only school building in school districts 316 and 319 that is

the seems. The question is what to do about it. The school
boards of Independent School District 319 and 316 met in a workshop
Monday night at the Marble School. Tom Watson of the Watson
Consulting Group talked to both boards about long-term planning. He told the boards their districts won’t survive long without
referendums. Fred Tanner, chair of the Greenway school board said
some choices have to be made soon. Dave Holmbeck, Director on the
Nashwauk/Keewatin School board, said it is easy for the two communities
to poke fun at each other’s situation. Board members listened to
Watson present possible shared and consolidation models. The
board will look at actual costs and building use tables when they meet
again next month. 

Cohasset Legislative News 052510 
 The city of Cohasset
received half of what it asked for this legislative session. State Representative Loren Solberg and Senator tom Saxhaug outlined the
session for the city Tuesday night. The city was able to make a
shift with its TIF funds through legislative action. Another
Solberg/Saxhaug bill that would have conveyed Tioga (ty-O-ga) beach to
Cohasset was lumped with the fish and game bill, which was
vetoed. A third bill was considered to give power companies the
right to deduct the cost of pollution control equipment. That
bill didn’t get far. Another Saxhaug/Solberg bill, for taconite
Tax Relief will give Cohasset another $200,000 for the Beier Road
project.  
 Mayor Pro Tem
Nyle LaGrange told the board they are just waiting for Burlington
Northern to set a schedule.

their yard, garage, and basements to city hall and the city will
dispose of it. The city has seen an increase in the use of this
service.  Residents will be asked for ID before they are
allowed to add to the pile. That’s June 6,7 and 8th in
Cohasset. In other business, the city hired three part-time
employees for the park department and two employees in the public works
department for the summer. 
 

 Canisteo Update 051310
 The residents of Bovey may be able to sleep a little easier and
have drier basements soon. The Minnesota DNR may start draining water
from Canisteo this year. DNR Commissioner Mark Holsten indicated in a
letter to the Western Mesabi Mine Planning Board that he intends to
start acquiring easements and begin engineering design work for the
Prairie River option. Holsten was granted the authority by the bonding
law that provided three point one million dollars for the Canisteo
Project. Holsten stated the board’s preferred Holman–Trout
option is not ready to proceed due to budget and time issues.
Construction on the interceptor trench to provide immediate wet
basement relief for Bovey residents continues. 
 

 05-03-10            Negotiations
 Independent School District 318 Superintendent Joe Silko
announced Monday night during the school board meeting that the
district has a tentative agreement with one of its unions. The
district has come to a tentative agreement with the Principals union,
according to Superintendent Silko. Before the contract is
finalized, it must be voted on and approved by union membership and
approved by the school board. The board held a negotiation
session Monday April 26th with members of the teacher’s bargaining
unit, Education Minnesota Local 1314. No agreement was reached. 

 05-03-10 School Board Business
 School District 318 will hold its Academic Excellence Awards on
Wednesday May 12th. Superintendent Silko invited the public to
watch the students take home some awards.
The presentation is at 7pm Wednesday May 12th at the Reif Center. 
 

 SHIP Grant 042910
 For some kids, the only balanced meal they eat is at
school. But how balanced is that meal? The statewide health
improvement program, known as SHIP, was awarded a forty-seven million
dollar grant to help Minnesotan live longer by reducing the burden of
chronic disease. As part of that grant, a nutritionist has been
working with a nutrition committee at the Greenway schools to offer
healthy food and healthy choices.
The committee also recommended healthy breakfast choices, eliminating
food as a reward, and using only low fat milk. The SHIP funds
will also be used to allow for purchasing more fresh healthy foods for
this school year. 
 

 Cohasset Hook and Ladder BBQ 042810
 The Cohasset Hook and Ladder will hold a community barbeque on
May 7th at the Cohasset City Hall. Ham sandwiches will be served
on 6 inch hoggie buns for $6.00. There will be beans, chips,
sourkraut, pop and coffee. The barbeque will begin at 5pm. Three hundred pounds of fresh ham will be served. Residents are
also invited to tour the fire hall during the open house.  
 

 Helicopter Makes Emergency Landing 042410
 On Saturday morning a Bell 47 light helicopter under contract to
the Minnesota DNR experienced a mechanical failure and made a forced
landing in a remote area of northern Minnesota. The accident occurred
between 7 and 7:30 about 35 miles north of Two Harbors. The pilot
was the only person on board and reported no apparent injuries. Emergency Medical personnel from Two Harbors and the Lake County
Sheriff’s Search and Rescue Squad responded to the accident. The
accident has been reported to the FAA for further investigation and
reporting. The helicopter was owned and operated by Scott’s Helicopters
based in Le Sueur. 
 

 Dry Conditions Continue 042610
 The Minnesota Department Natural Resources’State Climatology
Office is now classifying north-central Minnesota counties as“abnormally dry”and northeastern counties“in moderate drought.”The
problem began last year with precipitation shortfalls during the
growing season, then continued with below normal snowfall this winter.
Precipitation totals from mid-March through mid-April are near or below
all-time record lows; less than one-half inch of precipitation has
fallen over most of northern Minnesota since the snow melted. The
National Weather Service is predicting this trend will continue through
spring and possibly into July, causing drought conditions to intensify.
These abnormal conditions affect fire behavior. As the forest fuels
continue to lose their moisture, fires can become bigger and burn
hotter, making them more difficult to extinguish. A number of fires
this past week grew to 50-100 acres before firefighters could stop
them. Once fires are contained, it is taking days to extinguish all the
burning material because even the large dead and down material, which
is normally still moist from winter snows, are burning. A recent fire
near Hoyt Lakes burned with flame lengths estimated at 300 feet. This
same fire produced spot fires one-half to one mile away. No rain is
forecast for northern Minnesota for the next seven days. Until then
grass, brush and trees will continue to dry out and the very high to
extreme fire danger will continue. The Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) increased restrictions on open burning because of the
hazardous fire conditions. The restrictions affect all burning,
including campfires, fireworks, outdoor welding, and prescribed
burning. The 37 counties included are: Aitkin, Anoka, Becker, Beltrami,
Benton, Carlton, Cass, Chisago, Clearwater, Cook, Crow Wing, Douglas,
Grant, Hubbard, Isanti, Itasca, Kanabec, Kittson, Koochiching, Lake,
Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen, Marshall, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Otter
Tail, Pennington, Pine, Polk (that portion east of County Highway 6 and
south of State Highway 92), Pope, Roseau, Sherburne, Stearns, Stevens,
St Louis, Todd, and Wadena. Burning permits are not being issued, with
very limited exceptions, and only by state and federal forestry
offices. Under the new restrictions, fireworks are not allowed outside
municipalities and devices with open flame, such as welders and
acetylene torches, are prohibited in forest and grass areas, except
under special permit. Campfires are still allowed, however, the burning
period has been restricted to 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. The fire must be in a
fire receptacle designed for such use and associated with a residence,
resort, or developed public and private campgrounds. In all situations,
there must be an adequate source of water immediately available for
extinguishing the campfire.
The DNR is no longer allowing prescribed burning and running fires
until conditions improve, except in areas outside the aforementioned
counties where the DNR regional director may authorize prescribed
burning as necessary. Restrictions will remain in place until
sufficient precipitation is received to moderate fire danger. If normal
precipitation is not received in the near future, additional
restrictions may be imposed. 
 

 Saxhaug 042210
 The Enhanced Driver’s License bill, authored by Senator Tom
Saxhaug, has passed the Senate. The EDL would, on a voluntary basis,
allow for a micro-chip to be included on a regular driver’s license to
enable easier border crossings by land or water. Senator Saxhaug said
it is important to Minnesota commerce.
He pointed out that Manitoba and Ontario already have them and they
proved very successful between Washing and British Columbia during the
recent Olympics. There is less than a month left in this
legislative session and over seven hundred million dollars in budget
deficit. Senator Tom Saxhaug said the remaining deficit will have to be
balanced with cuts to either Health and Human Services or K–12
Education or some combination of both.

 Tower Man Injured
 An 18 year old man from Tower was critically injured in a one
vehicle roll-over accident in Polk County Monday evening. The 1999
Grand Am, driven by Gabrielle Benjamin was eastbound on Highway 28,
left the roadway, entered a ditch and rolled. The passenger, Gewaden
Dunkly, was ejected pinned under the vehicle. Benjamin was treated and
released at the Glenwood hospital; Dunkly remains a patient at a St
Cloud hospital. 
 

 Race To The Top 042010
 Is the state of Minnesota going to make a second bid for“Race
To the Top”federal education funds? According to Independent
School District 318 School Superintendent Joe Silko, even if Minnesota
applies for and wins federal funds, most dollars will stay in the metro
area. Superintendent Silko told board members that Education
Minnesota, the legislature and the Governor all have different opinions
about what needs to be done before the state can reapply.
Silko said the Governor wants more accountability for teachers,
Education Minnesota wants lower class size and the legislature wants to
funds to be driven by need. However the grant is designed, Silko
said the one thing that is true is that federal funds will be the only
chance to additional education funding the state will receive.
 

 Solberg 041510
 Enhanced Drivers License
An enhanced driver’s license would enable Minnesota residents to cross
into Canada by land or water without needing a passport. Representative
Loren Solberg said it is a voluntary program where a micro-chip would
be placed in the license with no more information than is required for
a passport or regular driver’s license. Information such as proof of
citizenship and that you do not have a felony conviction. Solberg said
it is cheaper than a passport and more convenient for sportsmen and
truckers making frequent trips across the border. He pointed out there
are several states and Canadian provinces that currently have the EDL.

Property Tax Refund Anniversary
April 14th was a birthday party of sorts for the state&apos;s Property Tax
Refund Program, now 35-years old. Representative Loren Solberg said
only about half of those eligible file for a property tax refund and it
is especially important for seniors on fixed incomes, who&apos;ve seen their
home values and property taxes increase dramatically over the decades. 
 

 Campus Life Youth for Christ Comedy
Café041510
 A no cost fundraiser is exactly what you would expect for the
Comedy Café, sponsored by Campus Life Youth for Christ. Patty
Holycross is a coordinator for the event. She said the event is free,
they are only asking for donations. It starts out as a Dessert Social
then comedian Bob Stromberg, a founding member of Triple Espresso out
of the Cities will entertain. Carol-Lee Geisler is the Administrative
Assistant for the Youth For Christ program. She said they need to
provide a head count to the Timberlake so they would like reservations
made by Monday April 19th at noon. She said you can call 326-9709 or
326-3258 to leave a message. Geisler said the Youth For Christ program
is international. This is an important year for the Itasca County
program, their fortieth. Geisler said her husband started the Campus
Life program in 1971 and has been mentoring teens ever since. The
Comedy Caféfundraiser Thursday April 22nd at the Timberlake
Lodge; reservations are needed by noon on Monday April 19th. 
 

 GRHS Grease 041510

finding summer love and returning to High School and discovering they
have very different lifestyles. Tickets are five dollars for students,
seven for adults and available at the door. Shows are at 7:30 PM
Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the Reif Center. 
 

 County Board Meeting 041410
 The setting of the regular agenda at Tuesday’s Itasca County
Board meeting proved to be a difficult task. Commissioner Catherine
McLynn moved to approve the agenda without Exhibit G, a request for
board action (RBA) from the Agriculture Association requesting a loan
of one hundred fifty thousand dollars for improvements to lighting at
the Itasca County fairgrounds. Board chair District One Commissioner
Lori Dowling called for the vote which failed 2 to 3. Commissioner Mark
Mandich moved the agenda with item“G”included; which passed. With the agenda finally approved the board moved on to recognition of
county employees, Exhibit B. There was a legislative conference call
scheduled for 3:15 PM, Exhibit C; however it was five minutes away so
Board Chair Dowling suggested an item be moved up in the agenda. The
board agreed and Sheriff Medure presented a resolution supporting
National Telecommunicators Week. Exhibits C and D, a conference call
and housing report from the Range Readiness Initiative were completed.
More problems arose with the next item on the agenda, a closed session,
Exhibit F. Board Chair Dowling suggested Exhibit“G”be moved before
the closed session in deference to spectators in the audience.
Commissioner McLynn objected to the move and Dowling referred to County
Administrator Lois Kottke, who serves as board parliamentarian for a
ruling. She indicated that there is precedence in the action, both in
the current board meeting and in previous ones. The Board Chair moved
Exhibit G ahead of Exhibit F. County Auditor Jeff Walker, who was
listed as a presenter, and Fair Board Chair Ron Oleheiser were asked to
step forward to present the RBA. Commissioner McLynn again objected, to
which Dowling indicated McLynn was out or order. The presentation was
heard by the board and after input from Mike Haig of the County
Attorney’s Office Commissioner McLynn moved to refer the RBA to the
next Transportation Land Management (TLM) meeting where there could be
more discussion. The board agreed to refer the topic to the next TLM
meeting. 
 

 Saxhaug 041410
 “Hurry up and wait”is a term that symbolizes what the Minnesota
Legislature is experiencing. Senator Tom Saxhaug said that they are
waiting for the federal government for funding that would help balance
the remaining seven hundred million dollar budget deficit facing the
state. That funding may provide about four hundred million dollars
which would go toward the Health and Human Services budget; hopefully
reducing the severity of the remaining cuts. Senator Saxhaug indicated
the legislature may recess while waiting for the federal funding and
that once the funding became available the remainder of the session
could go very quickly.

A bill that could be on the Senate Floor for a vote soon is the
enhanced driver’s license, authored by Senator Tom Saxhaug. A voluntary
micro-chip would go in a license enabling easier crossings into Canada.
He said the chip would ask for no more information than a passport or
our current driver’s license requires. Saxhaug said other states and
Canadian provinces use them successfully. 

Get Fit Itasca 041410
 Active Living and Healthy Eating. That’s the two pronged
approach Get Fit Itasca is using to fight obesity in Itasca
County. Betsy Johnson, with Get Fit, gave the Cohasset City
Council an update on funding for trails in the county. Johnson
said one of the goals is to connect trails in Grand Rapids with trails
in its“sister cities”of Cohasset and Coleraine, creating more active
transportation routes.  Johnson said we are a car-driven
society and creating more trails will go a long way to helping fight
obesity. Currently, Cohasset maintains the Tioga Trail. There are also state trails at the Forest History Center. Get Fit
is also working with the Itasca Economic Development Corporation to
encourage a trail through the former Ainsworth property. 

Local Weather Statistics for March 2010

 City Council/Zabinski 041310
 The area around the current site of the Saint Josephs Church,
just west of the end of 21st St SW, will eventually be known as the St
Josephs Addition. At Monday’s Grand Rapids City Council meeting the
first step was accomplished. Mayor Pro-tem Ed Zabinski said the area
will be developed to allow for new and existing roads to be improved.
Forest Hills Avenue and Timber Line Avenue would connect to 21st Street
SE; which would also eventually connect to Horseshoe Lake Drive to the
west.

Lot one, block one of the Jones addition in Grand Rapids is located
along Second Avenue SE between 15th and 17th Streets; behind the auto
sales lots. Mayor Pro-tem Ed Zabinski said the city had been loaned the
use of this tax-forfeited parcel from the state to locate the south
side fire-hall; however that wasn’t economically feasible at this time
so the city wants to buy the property and resell it to a developer to
get it back on the tax rolls. He pointed out that this is only the
start of a multi-step process.

An action taken at Monday’s Grand Rapids City Council meeting moved the
location of precincts one and five polling places. Mayor pro-tem Ed
Zabinski said precinct one has moved across the street from the airport
terminal to the United Methodist Church and Precinct five has moved
from the former township hall to the IRA Civic Center. He said the
primary election is scheduled for August 10th.

The Grand Rapids City Council held two public hearings Monday evening.
One was on a proposed ordinance prohibiting the feeding white-tailed
deer within the city limits. Mayor pro-tem Ed Zabinski said the council
was listening to the public and some residents spoke out in favor of a
ban; however there was no council action taken on the ordinance. The
second public hearing was on revising the blight ordinance. Zabinski
said the current process could take years to resolve an issue. The
revised ordinance will streamline the process considerably; however the
decision won’t be made until the next city council meeting on April
26th.
 
 

 Fire Restrictions Heightened 041210
 Due to an increased concern about wildfires across the state,
the Minnesota DNR tightened restrictions on campfires in 37 Minnesota
counties early this morning. Counties around our area include Aitkin,
Beltrami, Carlton, Cass, Clearwater, Cook, Crow Wing, Hubbard, Itasca,
Koochiching, Lake, Lake of the Woods and St. Louis. Jean Bergerson is
with the Inter-agency Fire Center said campfires will not be allowed at
non-designated campsites and other remote locations. This will impact
shore lunches, dispersed campsites, day hikes, and backpacking trips.
Campfires are still permitted in designated fire receptacles at
residences, dwellings, campgrounds, and resorts if they are no larger
than 3 feet in diameter and 3 feet in height. In addition, fireworks
will be prohibited outside municipalities due to the volatile nature of
these explosives. Bergerson said these areas are often very close to
sources of ignition and usually very difficult to get to. These
restrictions will remain in place until sufficient precipitation is
received to moderate the fire danger. If normal precipitation is not
received in the near future, additional restrictions may be imposed. A
complete list of counties affected can be found on the DNR web-sire at www.dnr.state.mn.us . 
 

 Saxhaug 040810
 The Minnesota Legislature has reduced the states budget deficit
by three hundred thirteen million dollars. Senator Tom Saxhaug said the
remainder of this year’s session has to deal with the remaining seven
hundred million dollar shortfall. He said the state is expecting about
four hundred million from the federal government for health care which
will leave about three hundred million dollars; most of which will be
from cuts. Saxhaug said there is a bill working its way thru the
Minnesota Legislature may ease border crossings by water and land. It
is an enhanced driver’s license with a micro-chip embedded in it. The
EDL is voluntary program which should cost about fifteen dollars extra.
Saxhaug pointed out that both Washington and British Columbia, Canada
have them which made travel back and forth during the Olympics very
smooth. He said this would be a great option for sportsmen traveling
between the US and Canada without the expense of a passport. 
 

 Severe Weather Awareness Week 040810
 The week of April 19th thru the 23rd is Severe Weather Awareness
Week in Minnesota. While our area usually does not get tornados we do
experience other types of severe weather. There are daily topics set up
by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management. On Monday April 19th thunderstorms,
hail, lightning and straight line winds will be the focus. Tuesday’s
topic of awareness is Severe Weather Warnings. On Wednesday Floods and
Flash Floods will be the topic. On Thursday there will be two statewide
tornado drills; the first drill will take place at 1:45 PM with an
optional second one occurring at 6:55 PM. Listeners are reminded the
warning sirens are designed to notify people outside, not in homes.
Friday’s topic will be heat, something we haven’t experienced a lot of
up here in the northland; however we still need to be aware of its
effect on humans, pets and livestock. KOZY news will offer a
daily reminder of and safety tips for each day’s severe weather topic.
For more information you can visit the Minnesota Department of Public
Safety’s Severe Weather Awareness web-site at www.severeweather.state.mn.us .
 

 Updated Stabbing at Seven Cities Short
040710
 More information has been released in Friday’s stabbing incident
at Seven Cities. Tobias Lanum and Andrew Dowling, both 18 year old
Grand Rapids residents, have been charged with first and second degree
aiding and abetting attempted murder and first and second degree aiding
and abetting assault. According to the criminal complaint Lanum stabbed
18 year old John Bennett of Bovey eight times. Bennett was treated at
Grand Itasca and released on Sunday. According to the criminal
complaint Bennett told investigators he went to Seven Cities with Lanum
and Dowling thinking he had been invited to a party. According to the
criminal complaint Dowling thought Lanum had“snitched”on him
regarding a fight the previous week and intended to kill Bennett and
burn the body. Investigators say Lanum sent a third party a text
message indicating he would also kill Dowling if Dowling became
suspicious. At hearings on Monday the court set bail for Lanum at
$250,000 without conditions or $100,000 with conditions and set bail at
$100,000 for Dowling with conditions or $50,000 with conditions. The
conditions include maintaining contact with their lawyers, no contact
with the victim, not leaving the state without court permission and no
drug or alcohol use. The next hearing for both defendants has been set
for May 10th. 
 

 School Enrichment 040710
 The Minnesota Academic Excellence funds are gone. But,
Independent School district 318 has committed to continue to invest in
academic extra-curricular activities. The district continues to
offer ten enrichment opportunities for students from elementary through
senior high including an art club, math masters, economics competition
and junior naturalist.  Many of the leaders of these
activities are volunteers. Robert J Elkington Middle School
Assistant Principal Dan Adams told the school board Tuesday night that
the programs are mostly run by volunteers. Currently, all these
programs run on a budget of about thirteen thousand dollars. New
programs may be accepted if there is student interest and a qualified
volunteer to take on the project.    
 

 Updated Stabbing at Seven Cities Short
040610
 A second Grand Rapids man is in custody in connection with the
stabbing incident that occurred Friday night at Seven Cities. Sheriff
Medure indicated 19 year old Andrew Dowling was arrested late Monday
afternoon for Aiding and Abetting Attempted Murder in the First&amp;Second Degrees and Aiding and Abetting Assault in the First&amp;Second Degrees. The victim, Jon Bennett, was released from the Grand
Itasca Clinic and Hospital on Sunday. Dowling is currently being held
in the Itasca County Jail pending formal charges by the County
Attorney’s office. The first suspect in connection with the stabbing,
Tobias Lanum, turned himself in to the Sheriff Office on Saturday
morning. He was charged in District Court on Tuesday with Aiding and
Abetting Attempted Murder in the First and Second degrees and Aiding
and Abetting Assault in the First and Second degrees. 
 

 Missing Girl 040510
 Early Monday afternoon the Itasca County Sheriff’s Office
received a 911 call reporting a missing four year old girl. Itasca
County Sheriff Pat Medure identified the young girl as Lydia
Johannsen. The Sheriff stated Lydia was playing in the yard south
of Calumet on CR 12 when she walked away. The parents called 911
after they were unable to locate her. The Sheriff said she was located
about three quarters of a mile south from her home by a passerby. The
alert citizen notified searchers about a young girl standing near the
tree line on CR 12. She was missing for a little over two hours before
being located. 
 

 Child Abuse Prevention and Awareness
04-02-10
T here is a service offered here in Itasca County called the
Itasca Crisis Nursery that is available free of charge. Becky Boelter
with Crisis Nursery said they have been operating for ten years. They
are having an open house on Thursday April 29th from 5–7 PM at the
Itasca Resource Center. Everyone is welcome. She said the crisis
nursery is a child abuse prevention and family support program that
works with families to defuse a potentially abusive situation by
placing children, temporarily, in a safe licensed child care facility.
There are no income guidelines and their 24 hour hotline number is
327-8652. April is also Child Abuse Prevention and Awareness month,
symbolized by the blue ribbons worn by co-workers and displayed at area
businesses. Starting Monday April 5th there will also be blue pinwheels
on the lawn of the Central School serving as a reminder that there are
children living in abusive situations. For more information on Child
Abuse Awareness Month you can contact Boelter at 327-8653 or visit the
national Child Welfare Information website at www.childwelfare.gov . 

Solberg 04-01-10
 The Capitol Investment, Jobs or Bonding Bill was passed and
signed into law very early in this year’s legislative session.
According to Representative Loren Solberg the idea was to get jobs
created during this construction season. In that bonding bill were two
projects for our area, the ATV trail from Aitkin to Grand Rapids and
about nine hundred thousand dollars for railroad crossing safety
improvements. He said there are also some“paint ready”projects in the
Minnesota State Colleges and University system and a few new
construction projects.

The Jobs Two Bill has also been passed by the Legislature;
Representative Loren Solberg said he was part of that task force to
create a bill dealing with Angel Credit and the Historical Building
Credit. He said there is also about a million dollars in the Grand
Rapids and Aitkin area for jobs creation. Solberg said they have worked
closely with communities to prioritize projects.

At the opening of this legislative session the state’s budget faced
over one billion dollars in deficit. Representative Loren Solberg said
they have reduced that amount by about a third or three hundred
thirteen million dollars. The Governor had recommended cutting Local
Government Aid by two hundred fifty million dollars; however the
legislature insisted on only one hundred five million in cuts for LGA.
Solberg said even with those cuts there is a long way to go to balance
the budget. 
 

 03-31-10 Bullying
 Is your kid a bully? Parents hope not, but how do they
know?
Last night, Conner Jasper Middle School principal Jake Nelson told the
school board that his school staff are out in the hallways between
classes watching for altercations and bullies. Superintendent
Mark Adams asked for the public’s help in identifying kids targeted by
bullies. Adams said both Greenway and the Nashwauk/Keewatin
school districts are exploring training on bullying for teachers, bus
drivers, even cafeteria staff. If you know of a child who is a
victim of a bully, report it to the school.  Principal
Nelson told board members that he can’t stop it unless he’s made aware. 
 

 03-31-10 Titans
 On a 4-2 vote Wednesday night, the Greenway school board voted
to allow the co-op and collaborative Greenway and Nashwauk/Keewatin
sports teams to become Titans. 
The Nashwauk/Keewatin school board voted Monday night during its school
board meeting to allow students participating in shared sports to use
the name Titans when referring to the team. The new colors will
be blue and green. 
Wednesday night, the Greenway school board followed suit. Twelve
hundred and fifty students chose the name Titans for their
teams.  
Tara DeGuisseppi made a motion to rename all shared sports (coop and
collaborative) Titans pending financial discussion of a shared 65/35
cost.  That motion passed on a 4-2 vote. 
 

 03-31-10 Van Dyke Food Drive
 Students in Van Dyke Elementary School were challenged to raise
seven hundred pounds of food during the March food drive. They
exceeded their goal.  Classes competed against each other to
bring in food and money for the food shelf. If students made
their goal, they would get to duct tape principal Rae (Ray) Villebrun
to the wall. And, the class that brought in the most food/money
would get to throw pies at her. Students exceeded their goal by
raising 5243 pounds of food. Mrs. Paula Troubbley’s third graders
brought in 1530 pounds of food to win. The second place was Mr.
Dzelski’s 3rd grade class with 5211 pounds.      
 

 3-29-10 Greenway-Nashwauk Keewatin
Collaboration
 Students in the Greenway and Nashwauk/Keewatin school districts
can expect more rigorous course offerings in the
fall. The school board of Greenway and Nashwauk/Keewatin met in a
workshop last night to talk about how to expand academic opportunities
for kids. Superintendent Mark Adams said the boards are exploring
some“hybrid”models. Models may include sharing staff, using
ITV, bussing students from one district to the other or some
combination of all these. Adams said now that the districts have
balanced budgets, the boards can see a light at the end of the
tunnel. Greenway Board Chair Fred Tanner said the workshop

 03-18-10            Pokegama Dam
 Work began this week on the Pokegama Dam on Highway 2
West. 
Jeff Kleinert, the Pokegama Dam Tender, said a construction crew is
making the dam safer for both employees and the public. The
upgrade consists of changing from 6 wooden log gates to 14 steel gates
to control water flow on the Mississippi. He said this will make
it easier to adjust flow and safer for personnel who do the work. During the year-long process, the dam will be closed to pedestrian
traffic. But, according to Kleinert, when it does reopen, the
pedestrian path will be separated from the dam workings and it’ll be
safer from both foot traffic and employees.

 College in the Schools 3-2-10
 How do you keep kids from leaving high school to take college
courses? You offer them college level courses and no
tuition. For the students enrolled in the District 318 College in
the Schools program, you offer classes that earn free college
credits. This school year, district students will earn 990 free
college credits. Based on three hundred dollars a credit, local
families saved almost three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in
college tuition. 
College in the School is college level coursework. Students earn
both high school and college credit. When students stay in high
school, the funding stays with them.

 Elementary Exercise 3-2-10
 How often do elementary students need physical exercise? Teachers and parents talked to school board members Monday night during
the District 318 school board meeting about possible changes to the
elementary school day. About 40 teachers and parents attended the

proposal made to teachers to cut back phy ed in the elementary
schools. Doctor Scott McBride told the board that studies have
shown“little people”need exercise on a daily basis. 
Superintendent Joe Silko told the audience that’s just one
proposal. He thanked the teachers for their dedication to their
students and at the same time told the audience that schools can’t keep
doing“business as usual.” Parents and the state want students to
graduate with reading, written language and math skills.  
 

 Cohasset Fire Report 02-23-10
 If you live in Cohasset, make sure your house numbers are

 District 318 Teachers Contracts 02-16-10
 Over fifty teachers and parents attended the school board
meeting of Independent School District 318 Tuesday night. The
district and its teachers union have not settled on a new
contract. During the half hour open forum prior to the board
meeting, a number of teachers talked to the board about their
value. 
Whether it’s teaching more students at a time or buying pencils and
hand sanitizer, teachers are doing more with less. Board member
Tom Peltier told those present that he didn’t disagree. Dave
Calligury, negotiator for the teacher’s union, said the teachers are
asking for a 1½percent increase during each year of the
two-year contract. Calligury said its time to get the focus back on to
the students where it belongs. 
Board member Paul Meyer, who is on the negotiating committee for the
district, said the offer by the board was a cash offer. The offer
is at $125 cash payment in the first year and 0.5% in the second year
OR a $500 cash payment for each year.
The district was penalized twenty-five dollars per pupil for missing
the state-imposed January 15th deadline for a settlement. 
 

  Tennis Courts in Cohasset
02-10-10         
 Tuesday night, the Cohasset City Council was asked to consider
building public tennis courts. The city had public courts, but
they weren’t maintained and became unusable. Forty-eight students
ranging in age from 9 to 14 signed a petition asking the council to
consider putting courts back in Cohasset. Tuesday, First
Lady Michelle Obama teamed up with athletes, farmers, doctors, the food
industry and media to take on the childhood obesity &quot;epidemic&quot; when she
launched the &quot;Let&apos;s Move&quot; campaign. Nearly one in five US kids aged six

 VOYAGEURS ICE AND TRAIL CONDITIONS 011510
 The staff at Voyageurs National Park has an updated trail
conditions report. An additional inch of new snowfall has enhanced
already good travel conditions; all snowmobile trails within the park,
including the Chain of Lakes Trail, are now open for use. All
overland portages, with the exception of the Kettle Falls Portage, have
been groomed with the use of a small grooming device pulled behind a
snowmobile. As a result, travel over portage trails within the
park is vastly improved and will be maintained until ice conditions
allow for the use of the full-size groomer. Tenacious thin ice
conditions near the Rainy Lake Visitor Center prevent the establishment
of the Rainy Lake Ice Road. Please remember that the snowmobile
speed limit within Voyageurs National Park is 45 mph on frozen lake
surfaces and 25 mph on all overland portages. Speed limit signs are
posted at trailheads and overland portages. Weekly winter trail
conditions reports are available on our website at www.nps.gov/voya .

Rainy Lake Visitor Center to Kettle Falls on Rainy Lake is now open and
staked as a result of improved ice conditions. In addition, efforts to
open the Chain of Lakes Trail will soon begin, but is expected to be a
slow process due to the clearing of downed trees and low hanging
branches resulting from the heavy holiday snowfall. A vehicle that

Federal Grants Aid Northeast Minnesota
Poverty Programs 010610
 Two federal agencies are awarding over $2.2 million in federal
grants to combat poverty and homelessness in Minnesota, Congressman
James Oberstar recently announced. The funding will support
programs which supplement food, shelter, rent, mortgage and utility
assistance for low-income people. The Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) is awarding $1.8 million to programs in Northeast
Minnesota. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will
make almost $450,000 in grants to programs in Northeast Minnesota.
 
Congressman Oberstar said “This is
the worst economic downturn in decades; we have to make sure that
resources are available to help people in tough times. For many
families, the loss of a job is a disaster; they need help to keep going
until they can find new employment, programs like these can help bridge
that gap until their circumstances improve.” 

Kootasca Community Alliance / Itasca Transitional Housing was awarded
over $32,000 in grants from HUD and Itasca County received a grant of
over $37,000 from FEMA. 
 

 School Busses
 Parents. When you send your children to the bus in these
frigid temperatures, make sure the bus arrives. Superintendent
Joe Silko told the board that Monday morning the district had problem
with five of the school route busses. Some of the busses sent to
replace those busses had trouble, too. Silko said the severe
temperatures and the bio-diesel the district has to use in the busses
cause problems. Silko asked that parents make sure their children
have hats, boots, mittens, scarves and appropriate outerwear for the
temperatures. If at all possible, Silko said, try to watch the
children go from one secure warm area to another.  
 

 First Fire Call 010410

contaminated site and create some local jobs. Grand Rapids was one of
14 recipients awarded money from the Minnesota Department of Employment
and Economic Development. DEED grants money twice a year under its
Contamination Cleanup Grant Program to help clean polluted sites across
the state. Over one point six million dollars was awarded in the most

being redeveloped into the Itasca Eco-industrial Park and this work is
expected to create about seventy jobs. 
 

 Mesaba Energy Project Update 123109
 There has been another positive step for the proposed Mesaba
Energy project. An administrative law judge is recommending the project
move forward. In a brief filed on Monday, he said that the
Environmental Impact Statement is adequate, and permits should be
issued. Excelsior Energy wants to build the $2 billion dollar plant
near Taconite. The judge also reviewed that site, and agreed it would
be a good fit. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will have a
final say on several issues, including the site and permits later this
spring. Excelsior still needs a customer for the proposed power plant. 
 

 Defensive Driving Classes 122909

 District 318 Meets
 Independent School District 318 approved a levy increase of
eleven percent Monday night. The board approved an eleven percent
increase in the district’s local levy. Business Manager Ben
Hawkins said that’s just a portion of the district’s funding. The
district budget is around $45,000,000. Local money and fees
account for just 13 percent of the budget. The district did see
an increase in taconite tax money. That money is based on a
three-year average, according to Hawkins. That money will drop
during the next two years as plants have reduced production or shut
down. The local levy was approved $7,255,873.41.  
 

 Greenway Levy Approved 121609
 Residents of the Greenway school district won’t see much of a
change on their school tax bill next year.
Mark Chase, the school’s business manager, presented the board with the
Truth in Taxation figures on Wednesday night. The levy will go up
less than $9500.
Some changes were significant. One of the district’s levies did
fall off, leaving the district with $275,000 less to work with. The district also lost $236,000 in health and safety dollars. Last fall, the board approved OPEB bonding, which allowed the district
to bond for $838,000 for retiree health care. Overall, the
district’s levy for 2011, payable in 2010 will be $1,714,275.  
 

 Cohasset City Budget
 The city of Cohasset approved the city’s levy for 2010 on
December 8th. 
The payable in 2010 levy was approved at $1,926,654. Mayor Ron
Hardy said that’s about fifty-six thousand dollars less than this
year. 
The city also approved the 2010 budget. 
In other action, the council held three public hearings. The
council made changes to the zoning ordinance regarding seasonal and
temporary property, home address, and signage. Every house in
Cohasset must now display the house numbers on the home. Fire
Chief Davin Tinquist said visible house numbers could save precious
seconds in an emergency. 
 

 Independent School District 318 Honors
 The board of Independent School District 318 will receive a
prestigious honor in January. 
The school board will be awarded the Minnesota School Board
Association’s District Award of Distinction. The award recognizes

MSBA and National School Board Assocation-sponsored meetings and
activities. The award will be presented during the MSBA’s
Leadership Conference Recognition Luncheon on January 14th in
Minneapolis. 
 

 Kain Sentenced 120809
 The former co-owner of Little Bear Lodges was sentenced to five
years of supervised probation and ordered to pay restitution for
stealing money from the company’s 401(k) plan between July and October
2007. Fifty-two year old Donald Kain pled guilty last month in Itasca
County District Court to felony theft. According to the criminal

Bovey-Colerain Youth Center said the kids participating are very fired
up to take part, until the next morning when they wake up to freezing
temps, if they even slept at all. She said the dialogue that takes
place brings a new realization of the homeless population and dispels
the stereotype that the homeless are there because of lack of ambition
or misuse of drugs or alcohol. This year there is a standing challenge
that for $300 you can“buy”someone into spending the night without a
home. Bovey Colerain Youth Center kids have challenged new Greenway
High School Principle Mr. Campbell to spend the night in a box.

back out of the box. Donations of blankets, warm clothing and personal
hygiene items will be accepted. To challenge someone into a box

 McLynn 102809

The motion passed with unanimous support from the board. Another item
on yesterday’s agenda concerned an environmental assessment worksheet
for a project to construct a substation and 115 kV transmission line to
serve the increased demand for electricity around Pokegama Lake.
Concern had been voiced by Board members over the increased workload to
the Environmental Services department of the county. Board members
discussed an option that would have the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission perform the EAW; however with a three–two vote the county
accepted the task. The Board hopes to keep the cost to Great River
Energy and Lake Country Power to a minimum, thereby keeping the cost to
consumers down. The dates and venue for the hearings will be announced
as the EAW process moves forward. County Auditor Jeff Walker presented
some facts about the apportionment of funds received from the sale of
tax-forfeited land for the ESSAR Steel Minnesota project. McLynn
pointed out that most of the funds went to the Greenway area since that
was where the tax-forfeited land came from. She indicated that there
has been some concern over the abandonment of stockpiles on some of the
land being sold to ESSAR. McLynn said the county retains mineral rights
and they are not giving the low grade ore stockpiles away. There will
be a public hearing on November 24th on the stockpile issue. The next
scheduled meeting of the Itasca County Board is November 10th at 3 PM
in the county board room.

though the enrollment is declining
We’re also may be getting better at identifying students who need extra
attention, according to Superintendent Joe Silko. The
Superintendent gave the board an update on the special education
department last night. He told the board it’s a significant
portion of the district’s population. One of the special needs
areas growing nationwide is autism. In 1993, the district served
1 autistic child. Today, that number is 32. Silko also said
the district is getting better at identifying children at risk.  
 

 Influenza-like illnesses 10-20-09
 District 318, like many other districts, is being hit by an
influenza like illness. 
The Grand Rapids High School sent out an Instant Alert to parents
Monday night letting them know of an increase in absenteeism because of
influenza like- symptoms. The Alert also reminded parents to take
precautions and keep their children home if they have a fever of at
least 100 and or a cough or sore throat. High school principal
Jim Smokrevich asked parents to keep to keep their children home for 24
hours after the fever has passed. 
Every building in the district, except Bigfork, is reporting at least a
five percent rate of absenteeism. That prompted the district to
make a report to the state. 
For more information, the district’s web site offers a checklist for
parents. Visit the distrrict’s web site at www.isd318.org for more

 Mercury Warning 
It&apos;s 3 a.m. Your two-year-old is crying. Her forehead is
hot and you fear she&apos;s running a fever. You rush to get a
thermometer. You grab one, but in your haste, you drop it. It breaks, and mercury beads shoot across the bathroom floor. Now
you&apos;ve not only got a sick kid, but a potentially health-threatening
mercury spill to deal with, too.

&quot;Lately we&apos;ve been advising more people on how to clean up spilled
mercury from broken fever thermometers, probably because they&apos;re using
them more with the advent of cold and flu season,&quot; said Lisa Yantachka,
an emergency responder with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
(MPCA). &quot;But running the risk of compounding your problems by
having a mercury thermometer in the house at all just doesn&apos;t make
sense.&quot;

While the vapor given off from spilled mercury is a neurotoxin that can
be health threatening if it is inhaled at a high enough concentration
or over a long period, mercury spills in the home almost always can be
cleaned up so that they do not pose a danger. However, cleaning
up a spill properly will take time and considerable care. And
cleanup can be expensive; if the mercury is spilled on a carpet, the
contaminated portion will have to be cut out and discarded. If it
is spilled on a mattress or upholstered chair, the mattress or chair
will have to be thrown away. Larger spills or widespread
contamination may even require the services of an environmental
contractor.

&quot;Digital thermometers are now the standard in the health care
industry,&quot; Yantachka said. &quot;They are as accurate as mercury
thermometers, but unlike mercury thermometers, they can&apos;t create a
health and environmental hazard.&quot;

Yantachka urges people to replace all the mercury thermometers in their
homes - fever and cooking - with digital thermometers and to take their
mercury thermometers to their local household hazardous waste facility
for proper disposal. Contact information for Minnesota&apos;s county
household hazardous waste facilities may be found at www.pca.state.mn.us/waste/hhw/hhw-localprograms.html or by calling the MPCA at 651-296-6300 or 1-800-657-3864.

If you break a mercury fever thermometer, you can probably clean up the
spilled mercury, but you&apos;ll need to exercise considerable care,
Yantachka said. Immediately after the spill:

Isolate the spill and ventilate the area. Keep all people and
pets away from the spill area. Open windows and exterior
doors. Close all doors between the room where the spill occurred
and the rest of the house. Close all cold air returns so that
mercury vapor is not carried throughout the house. Turn down
heaters and turn up window air conditioners. Turn off central air
conditioning. Turn off fans unless they vent to the
outdoors. Use fans to blow mercury-contaminated air outside. 

 If mercury
has touched your skin shoes, or clothing, stay still and have someone
bring you a plastic trash bag and wet paper towels. Wipe off any
visible beads of mercury with the wet paper towels and put them in the
trash bag. Check your shirt pockets for mercury. Remove
contaminated shoes and clothing and place them in the trash bag. Seal the bag and put it in the trash. Shower well.
If you feel you&apos;ve inhaled a lot of mercury vapor, call the Poison
Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Decide whether you can clean up the spill yourself, which you may be
able to do if the spill involved a single fever thermometer on a hard,
smooth surface. Call the Minnesota Duty Officer at 1-800-422-0798
to report the spill, any time, day or night. The Duty Officer
will put you in touch with an MPCA emergency responder who will advise
you on cleaning up the spill.

 9-15-09 Split Rock Lighthouse Birthday
Celebration

 The Minnesota Historical Society maintains many sites throughout
the state and one of them is turning one hundred years old. District
Manager Skip Drake said we have a terrible storm on November 28, 1095.
Drake said that storm sank many ships belonging to US Steel
transporting ore to blast furnaces on the North Shore and resulted in
the building of Split Rock Lighthouse. He said near Stony Point there
is a concentration of magnetic ore that throws off ship compasses and
can cause them to run aground. One of the engineering problems
confronting the builders of the lighthouse was the lack of a road. All
materials had to be transported by water and hoisted up the 130 foot
sheer rock cliff. The Minnesota Historical Society is planning a great
birthday celebration. For more information on the birthday party you
can visit the Minnesota Historical Society’s web-site at www.mnhs.org . 
 

 9-15-09 Local Charitable Gambling Groups
Meeting

 Allied Charities of Minnesota (ACM), the statewide organization
of charitable gambling organizations, will be hosting an informational
meeting in Grand Rapids for all charitable gambling organizations in
the region on Tuesday, September 22nd at 7:00 p.m. The meeting will be

King Wilson, Executive Director of ACM will be the featured speaker.
Rich Jaranson, ACM Region 2 Director from Bemidji will convene the
meeting.

Dick Horn, president of ACM, said, &quot;We&apos;re finding onerous state taxes
and rising costs are making it extremely difficult for our non-profit
organizations to continue our work in their local communities. We must
reform and reduce taxes on charitable gambling to keep our
organizations alive. The key to reforming and reducing charitable
gambling taxes is for the legislature to allow us to play electronic
bingo in the state. Charitable gambling started with bingo in the
1940’s. It’s time that we are allowed to operate bingo as a 21st
century game”.

Additional topics for discussion will include: a recap of the 2009
Legislative Session including charitable gambling law changes, the 2010
ACM legislative program development, an electronic bingo demo, the 19th
Annual Minnesota Lawful Gambling Convention&amp;Expo program in St.
Cloud scheduled for November 19 - 21, and a general question and answer
session.

The meeting is open to anyone involved or interested in charitable
gambling. For more information on this important meeting please call

for about 50 years.  Mike Barle from First National told the

a large number of claims. The district has had more than 60
workers compensation claims in the last 5 years as well as other

$18,000.   
 

 
05-27-09            Beier Road

favor. About 40 residents live on the Beier Road in
Cohasset. The city has been working to create a safer way to get
there off Highway 2 for years. Mesabi Nugget repaid a loan from
the Iron Range Resources early- freeing up allocation money. That
money will be used to fund the project. The city was appropriated
$350,000 for the project. The price tag for the signal and
railroad project is over $800,000. Representative Loren Solberg
shared the good news Tuesday night.  Work won’t begin until

become available by then. 
 

 
05-27-09            Davies Variance
 
After over an hour of public testimony, the Cohasset City Council

access right of way owned by the city. Cohasset had forced Davies
to remove the same shed in 2007. Davies asked for a variance to
reconstruct the shed in it former location.  After waiving
the $400 variance fee, the city’s planning commission approved the

caller, initiate the phone call or are able to verify the callers
identity.

platted areas. During a city council work session, the council
agreed to set up a commission to study the ordinance. About 25
residents showed up to get more details. The ordinance also
requires residents to license their pets through the city. To get
the license, residents must show proof of a rabies
vaccination.  Residents have until July 30th to register
their pets without penalty. The ordinance is expected to be
rewritten by that date.

dollars from the tobacco settlement. The Governor has pledged to veto
any bill that includes a tax increase.

 Cohasset
City
Council

Sometimes rumors can be shrugged off- other times they must be
addressed head-on. The Cohasset City council met them head-on
last night. The city council and Itasca County commissioner Lori
Dowling addressed a number of rumors Tuesday night. The rumor
that Itasca County is going to sell Tioga Beach to the city of Cohasset
so Cohasset can build condos on the property is not true. Mayor
Pro Tem Lyle LaGrange said the city has invested over $170,000 into the
property and would continue to maintain the park and beach area.
Commissioner Dowling told the council that the county is considering a
land swap with the city, Tioga Beach in exchange for property within
the city boundaries that the county could use. Dowling said
conditions would apply to the Tioga beach property that would continue
to keep it a public area. Dowling said the county is facing a one
point two million dollar defecit and would not be able to maintain
Tioga Beach the way Cohasset has. Currently, the city leases Tioga
Beach from the county for fifty dollars a year. The other rumor
regarded the sale of tax forfeit land to an individual. By state
law, the property must be first made available to the city. The
city has first right of purchase.

Community
Advisory Meeting

Should the Greenway School district close Marble Elementary School?
Scale kindergarten back to three days a week? Eliminate
electives?  The Greenway School district must consider cuts
of just under a million dollars for next school year. Superintendent Rochelle Van Den Hoeval presented the public and the
district 316 school board’s Community Advisory Committee with a
preliminary budget reduction list Tuesday night. Committee member
Gary Nyquist said the public just wants to know the school board is
listening to the public. The board still has the option of
levying for retiree health care costs, which would reduce the
district’s deficit to about one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.  But, those numbers are still dependent on how much
the state allocates to schools. The school board meets next
Wednesday March 25th at 6pm in the high school Media Room.
 

 03-17-09         ISD 318 Teachers

Monday night, the school board of Independent School District 318 voted

leaves of absence and two others have been placed on partial leaves of
absence because of decreased enrollment and financial
limitations. Earlier in the meeting, the board voted to authorize
the sale of 35 million dollars in general obligation bonds to cover the
district&apos;s post-employment benefits. Board member Tom Peltier
said this makes the least impact on students.  If the
district hadn&apos;t voted to authorize the sale of the bonds, the district
would have had to authorize almost two million dollars in cuts. These 20 employees account for $330 thousand dollars in cuts. Last year, the district cut 300 thousand dollars in budget items.
