Drinks from Applebees?
 How much are drinks at Applebees? (I know these can vary by location, I&apos;m asking for an approximate)

What is the best drink (alcoholic) that you&apos;ve had from there?

I&apos;m not a big drinker, but am going out to dinner with some friends, for some drinks too and want to know some good options. :D

 They usually range from $5-8.

At the Applebees near my house, they always have $2 Long Island Teas, a great deal, they&apos;re loaded with alcohol!

 I like the
Main Street&apos;Ritas®
This Sauza Gold favorite is available on the rocks or frozen in strawberry, mango, or wildberry flavors. Main Street&apos;Rita® Swirls A twist on our classic Sauza&apos;Rita, These signature Swirls with Sauza Gold come in strawberry-mango or wildberry-mango flavors.

I get the frozen strawberry mango swirl. Its really good. The website has a pic of it too!

 Drinks can start at $6 and go up to $15 depending on what you order and if it is considered top shelf.
