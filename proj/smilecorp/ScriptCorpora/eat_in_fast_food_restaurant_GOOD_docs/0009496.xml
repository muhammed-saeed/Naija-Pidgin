 Vegetarian Restaurant Spotlight: Diced Fresh in Chicago! 
 Saturday, June 11th, 2011 
 Simply put :  A Vegetarian’s Perfect Destination!

Many restaurants today claim their vegetarian selection is above the rest. Diced Fresh in Algonquin, Illinois is a vegetarian’s dream. Their menu is packed with fresh vegetables, intricate salads, and filling wraps. The restaurant environment creates a light-airy and eco-friendly place to grab lunch or dinner. The General Manager, Maggie Mirchef spoke with me about why she and her customers can’t get enough of Diced!

 In what ways does Diced Fresh promote an eco-friendly lifestyle? 

Diced Fresh is under new management and one of our top priorities is implementing a new recycling program as well as making a few more changes for the better! We do buy some food locally but we want to expand our locally bought supply.  We are going to be switching to much more Eco-friendly flatware. Our cleaning service is Green Seal certified and uses only green cleaning. We launched an iPhone and Android app which makes ordering all electronic therefore eliminating the use of paper.

 What are your most popular vegetarian friendly recipes? 

We have many soups that are vegetarian such as Minestrone, Butternut Squash, Broccoli Cheddar, our homemade Vegetable Chili, plus many more soups. We try to always have different soups so there is a big variety. We’ve also got the California Veggie wrap, made with a spinach tortilla it’s got spinach, garbanzo beans, green pepper, mushrooms, sunflower seeds, in a Pinot Noir dressing. Plus–our create your salads are guaranteed vegetarian with over 50 ingredients to choose from

 

 Where do you hope to see your business in the future? 

We hope to open more locations around the Chicago-land area. We want to promote healthy eating habits for everyone. Being that we are a fast food restaurant we also want to emphasize that eating fast food doesn’t have to compromise taste and, most importantly, your health. We want to make eating on the go a guaranteed healthy option. Sometimes you may not have the time to think about your meals–but we do!

 

 What percentage of your regular customers do you presume are practicing vegetarians or vegans? About 70% of our guests enjoy a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle.

 What is your favorite/most innovative item on the menu? 

I love our vegetable chili–it’s loaded with yellow squash, zucchini, garbanzo and kidney beans, tomatoes, with just enough spice to amplify the flavor.

 Any new recipes or items on the menu recently? 

We just started making our own smoothies! They are non-fat yogurt based with fresh fruits and are only 200 calories. We also just launched an app for iPhone and Android markets. Our app is free, it’s under Diced Fresh, and you can place your order through it so your meal is ready when you are!

 Meatless Monday Breakfast Ideas 
 Sunday, May 15th, 2011 
 
If you’re participating in Meatless Mondays, it’s important to make sure you kick the day off right with a hardy, healthy meal.

Here we’ve gathered three delicious vegetarian breakfast recipes, and if you have time to take your breakfast at a restaurant, we’ve recommended vegetarian restaurants in San Francisco, three Chicago vegetarian restaurants and a vegetarian restaurant in Atlanta.

 You Name It Crepes 
Crepes are great for breakfast because they can be interpreted in so many ways. Once you’ve mastered a simple crepe recipe you can top your creation with any fruits, veggies, syrups or spreads of your choice. Here is a recipe from allrecipes.com for a simple crepe that you can get creative with.

1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.

For beer battered crepes substitute the milk and water for 1 cup beer (your choice) and add an egg.

 
 Warm and Nutty Cinnamon Quinoa Recipe 
This recipe comes from 101cookbooks.com , which is definitely worth checking out for both the countless recipes and the great food photography.

1 cup organic 1% low fat milk
1 cup water
1 cup organic quinoa, (hs note: rinse quinoa) 
2 cups fresh blackberries, organic preferred
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup chopped pecans, toasted*
4 teaspoons organic agave nectar, such as Madhava brand

Combine milk, water and quinoa in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 15 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed. Turn off heat; let stand covered 5 minutes. Stir in blackberries and cinnamon; transfer to four bowls and top with pecans. Drizzle 1 teaspoon agave nectar over each serving. Serves 4. 

 

 

 
 “Bacon”, Potato, and Green Onion Frittata 
Just because you are vegetarian or participating in Meatless Mondays, does not mean you have to give up salty, savory, delicious breakfasts like the bacon and ham filled omelets that might come to mind. Instead you can use meat substitutes and get all the great taste you’re looking for without the negative health consequences of high fat, highly processed meats. This“Bacon”, Potato, and Green Onion Frittata comes from chooseveg.com.

1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
4-5 green onions, chopped with the green and white parts separated
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium potatoes, shredded (or 2 cups of frozen shredded potatoes)
2 tsp. salt, divided
1/2 tsp. pepper, divided
2 lb. firm tofu
2-3 Tbsp. soy sauce, to taste
4 Tbsp. nutritional yeast (optional)
2-3 Tbsp. faux bacon bits (try Bacos)

Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and the white part of the green onions and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and heat for another 30 seconds. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the potatoes, 1 tsp. of the salt, and 1/4 tsp. of the pepper. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, flipping the potatoes regularly until they are well browned. Blend the remaining salt and pepper, the tofu, soy sauce, and nutritional yeast in a food processor until they are creamy. Fold in the faux bacon bits, the green part of the green onions, and the fried potatoes and pour the mixture into a large, oiled pie or tart pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the center is firm. Allow the frittata to cool for 10 minutes then invert it onto a serving plate.

 
 
 Eating breakfast at a local restaurant? 

If you’re in Chicago, Blueberry Hill Pancake House , Ina’s , and Nest Cafe all have the city’s best vegetarian breakfast options.

In Atlanta, try Hard Rock Café’s “banging” breakfasts.

And, in San Francisco Red Tractor Café serves breakfast all day with pancakes, omelets, home fries and more.

 Chicago Vegetarian: Asian Corner 
 Thursday, December 2nd, 2010 
Being Vegetarian in Chicago is a lot easier than some may think. Building on our first post, Chicago restaurants serve many types of vegetarian eats from fast food to gourmet cuisine. A few of our favorite vegetarian cuisines include Chinese and Japanese food. Whether you want flavorful pot stickers or mouth watering veggie sushi, these Chicago local restaurants have everything you like.

This week we are looking at a variety of Chinese and Japanese indulgences, First on our list, Yu’s Madarin located in Schaumburg, IL. Yu’s has been making vegetarian and non-veg Chinese food for over 20 years. You can watch them thru their glass kitchen making their famous homemade noodles. I went here for the first time 15 years ago and their quality has not changed one bit- awesome!!! Start out with the clear vegetable soup and veggie pot stickers. Then move on to some great entrees such as Kung Pao tofu, Szechwan eggplant (amazing), and of course the vegetable noodle platter (I recommend to add bean curd aka tofu).

If sushi is your preference, Japonaise located at 600 W. Chicago Ave in Chicago is the place to be. Whether you want the best Shitake mushroom tempura (if you don’t mind the tempura being fried in the same oil as the shrimp) or Avocado&amp;Cucumber rolls, your pallet will be asking for more. They can make a custom vegetarian roll if that’s what you prefer and they are very flexible on replacing meat items with vegetarian ingredients. Even if it’s just a quick snack before enjoying drinks at their swanky river front lounge, Japonaise should always be a favorite sushi joint for the Chicago Vegetarian.
 

For something fast, tasty, and soft on the wallet the best place is Flat top Grill to make your own stir fry with many locations around Chicagoland. This place is easily addicting because they have gone above and beyond the needs of the Vegetarian Consumer. They have wide assortment of veggie friendly options such as Quorn (mushroom meat), Seitan (wheat meat), BBQ Vegetable Tempeh (soy protein)–GMO free, Curry Pakora (soy protein)–GMO free and of course good old fashioned tofu. A huge selection of sauces are available and have been identified if they contain and meat or fish products. Your meal can also come in a number of varieties such as traditional stir fry, mushu wraps, lettuce wraps or soup.
 

If you fancy Chinese or Japanese food this weekend, have a go at the restaurants above! Enjoy…
