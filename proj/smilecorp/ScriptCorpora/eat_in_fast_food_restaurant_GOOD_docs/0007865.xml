  Very disappointing dining experience. The portions were small, the food was cold and tasteless. The service was good, but the kitchen was slow considering that there were few customers to cater at the time. The salad was limp and wilted. The fish was dry and tasteless. A diner

  Humps is a pretty good restauraunt for casual dining. It&apos;s food isn&apos;t too bad but it&apos;s not perfect either. The service at Humps is good.

 Colvins Pub&amp;Grill   
 American, Brewery/Pub/Tavern 
  The food at Colvins is excellent. The dinner chef is unbelievable. If you are looking for something not on the menu, just ask. He will whip up something that you are sure to enjoy. Chicken fried prime rib is to die for!
