It comprises of games room, ice cream parlor, self service restaurant, coffee shop, fast food restaurant along with a casino, a theme park named Carthage Land . Though it has been built recently, it is built in a very old traditional style with cobbled streets, ancient lamp-posts, old style buildings and packed with many souvenir shops along with many places to eat and drink.
