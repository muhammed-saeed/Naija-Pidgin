 Ten Worst Fast Food Restaurants 

 By Jesse | July 25, 2010

I often get asked to list my favorite and least favorite fast food restaurants and chains. Well lucky readers, here is my list of the worst.

Ten Worst Fast Food Chains

 10. Jimmy John’s 
I know I’m going to take some heat for this one, but Jimmy John’s is not good. I don’t get the hype. Very plain, boring sandwiches at surprisingly high prices. I know it’s been a bad day when I eat Jimmy John’s, because I’m in the mood for plain food and willing to be priced gouged to get it. Two words sum up Jimmy Johns: overpriced and overrated.
 
9. Chicago area combination fast food hot dog, char-burger, pizza puff, gyro, pizza puffs and chicken places. 
If you’ve ever lived in Chicago or the surrounding area, you know what I’m talking about. These strange fast food stands that try to serve everything under the sun. While some pull it off, many are just a complete disaster.

 8. Long John Silver’s 
Want some deep fried fish sticks? Cause that’s what this place sells.

 

 7. A&amp;W 
I used to love this place. It was the only fast food spot in my hometown when I was really young. It was a classic drive up, only open in the summer. But since then, this chain has fallen apart. They’ve tried to become like every other burger spot. Their root beer is still great, but the rest pretty much sucks.

 6. Dairy Queen 
Hear me out. Dairy Queen has great Blizzards and ice cream treats, but their food is sub par.

 5. Combination Pizza Hut/Taco Bell/KFCs 
Make up your mind already. It’s just too much choice. Do I want fried chicken or tacos or burritos or a personal pan pizza? Something is inevitably neglected at these mini food courts. Fail.

 4. Sonic 
I really shouldn’t be passing judgment on Sonic. I’ve only been once. BUT they have an aggressive commercial media buy. I see their commercials all the time, yet I can’t ever try their food because THERE ARE NO SONICS WHERE I LIVE.

 3. White Castle 
Steamed grilled beef. Gross. I’ve enjoyed visits to White Castle, but more for the novelty than the food. Their burgers are sub par, and most White Castle’s I’ve been to are filthy and run down.

 2. Jack in a Box 
Or as my brother calls it“Yack in a Box”. I’ve only been to the Jack a few times, but was not impressed. Also, I’ve never  been able to get over the E. coli breakouts back in 1993. They made a big impression on my young mind.

 1. Carl’s Jr./Hardees 
Not only does this place boast some of the most unhealthy entrees in fast foodom, but the quality of the food is suspect. Every time I’ve eaten at either, I’ve left with a queasy upset stomach. Maybe partly due to my personal guilt at having eaten a“Monster”burger, but something just isn’t right at Carl’s Jr.

 Opinions? Am I crazy? Did I miss something? Sound off in the comments.

My list would include Brown’s Chicken. I know it is not necessarily fair to the chain, but ever since the massacre that occurred at one of their locations in the 90′s in Illinois, I’ve found it hard to ear their food. I also am not particularly found of their food, which is fair.

Not so sure I agree with your #9&amp;#10.

I’ve only been to Brown’s once, but I remember it left a lot to be desired.

I agree with Paul, it’s Burger King by a country mile. Thing is, I’ll still take the card.

I agree with #6. In fact, my wife says DQ food tastes like the American food you find in foreign countries.

I agree that Jimmy John’s is highly overrated. I went in for a supposedly gourmet sandwich and I got overcharged for a small middle-of-the-road sandwich. Then I read the menu board and right on their menu (if you read all of the crazy manic scribblings) you’ll see that it says“they are not gourmet: we lied”Just about any sub place beats Jimmy Johns.–I’d probably go to Subway before Jimmy Johns, and I don’t go to Subway. Burger King should definately be the #1 worst and then leave the next two slots open because it’s just not fair to put any of the others at #2 or #3 right near Burger King on the list. I’d rate DQ below Hardees. Hardees isn’t so bad if you ask me…it’s fast food but it’s not that bad. I don’t know why anyone would like DQ. Their burgers are nasty.
