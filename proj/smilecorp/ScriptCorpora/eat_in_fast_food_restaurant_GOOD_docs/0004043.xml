 An Omnipotent And Bolivian God 
 Church | Surrey, BC, Canada | 
 (The church I work at often gets people from the local community asking for financial aid. In order to help us best assess their need we require them to fill out an informational form.) 

 Me: “Good morning, [church name]. How can I help you?”

 Caller: “‘Till when is the office open? I need to come in and fill out one of those Bolivian forms.”

 Me: “I’m sorry, a Bolivian form? Do you maybe mean a form for our upcoming India trip?”

 Caller: “No, [pastor] told me to come in to fill out a Bolivian form.”

 Me: “Oh! A benevolent form!”

 Caller: “That’s what I said, a Bolivian form!”

 Customer: “Some lady parked wrong and is blocking all of the traffic in the parking lot.”

 Me: “Did you see her come into this store?”

 Customer: “No, I didn’t see her at all.”

 Me: “Then, how do you know that it was a woman?”

 Customer: “Because women always do things wrong.”

 (The woman in line behind her gasps at this.) 

 Customer: “Well, that’s what my husband tells me.”

 Supermarket | Perth, Western Australia, Australia | At The Checkout , Criminal/Illegal

 Me: “You’re not the ones who have been egging people in the carpark, are you?”

 Customer: “Uh, no. We, um, just want to make an omelette.”

 Me: “You’re making a thirty-six egg omelette? How big is your frying pan?”

 Customer: “S***.” *runs out of the store*

 Man: *strong Russian accent* “Excuse me, but where is the Russian carpark?”

 Me: “Pardon, sir, could you repeat that?”

 Man: “Where is the Russian carpark?”

 Me: “The Russian car park?”

 Man: “Yes!”

 Me: “There isn’t one. There’s just a regular car park.”
