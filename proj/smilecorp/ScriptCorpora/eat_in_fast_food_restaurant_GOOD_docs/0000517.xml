McDonald&apos;s faces tall order in trying to sell McJobs
 
Oak Brook-based giant looks to refry burger-flipping image in run-up to massive April 19 hiring
 April 04, 2011 | By Emily Bryson York, Tribune reporter 
 
 Jan Fields, president of McDonald&apos;s USA, believes her story and those of other senior managers will help recast the image of the company’s entry-level jobs. (Alex Garcia,…) 
In today&apos;s tough employment market, one company has become the go-to option for the frustrated job seeker: Starbucks. That&apos;s a problem for McDonald&apos;s as it seeks to beef up its workforce for what&apos;s expected to be another year of sales growth.

To nab the attention of top-flight candidates, the Oak Brook-based burger giant is tackling the image of a &quot;McJob.&quot; That means a weeks-long advertising and public-relations campaign leading up to April 19, when McDonald&apos;s Corp. plans to hire 50,000 store-level employees.
 
McDonald&apos;s hopes to get across the message, much as Starbucks Corp. has successfully done, that a job with it is not a dead end and can offer solid benefits and long-term career opportunities, which the company says already are available to its 600,000 restaurant employees in the U.S.

Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a Chicago-based restaurant industry consultancy, described the redefining of a McJob as a tall order.

While Paul said the chain &quot;has a great story to tell&quot; of the benefits it offers that many competitors don&apos;t, and the opportunities to move into management, &quot;they still don&apos;t have the image of a Starbucks.&quot;

&quot;McDonalds is considered to be a fast-food restaurant. It&apos;s going to be tough for them to differentiate themselves from the other fast-food restaurants,&quot; he said, adding that smaller chains, including Chick-fil-A and Panda Express, have been building credibility with young people in recent years as good places to work because of their benefits.

Jan Fields, president of McDonald&apos;s USA, believes her story and those of other senior managers will help recast the image of the company&apos;s entry-level jobs. Senior managers will appear at McDonald&apos;s restaurants to talk about their careers, and the company will promote the hiring event in a national newspaper and radio advertising campaign that&apos;s launching this week.

&quot;I have a McJob,&quot; said Fields, who started her career behind the counter in 1977 as a young mother working her way through school. &quot;And I&apos;m darned proud of it.&quot;

Half of the owner-operators of the chain&apos;s franchises started as restaurant employees, according to McDonald&apos;s, as did 40 percent of McDonald&apos;s corporate staff and 30 percent of its senior management, including CEO Jim Skinner.

Store managers at company-owned restaurants have responsibility for a $2.4 million business (average annual sales for U.S. restaurants) and after five years get a company car, Fields said. They also typically make $50,000 annually after five years.

&quot;McJob&quot; was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in 2003 and has remained there despite the company&apos;s protests. In 2005, McDonald&apos;s sought to boost the image of its restaurant jobs in ads featuring singer Macy Gray and track-and-field Olympian Carl Lewis, who both worked at McDonald&apos;s.

Fields said a number of company initiatives in the past three years have increased the need for manpower at an average U.S. location, where sales ticked up from $2.2 million in 2007 to $2.4 million in 2010. The burger giant rolled out lattes and other espresso drinks nationwide in 2008, necessitating a dedicated drink-maker, and more restaurants are adopting a 24-hour schedule.

Every year, McDonald&apos;s aims for 3 to 5 percent same-store sales growth on a global basis. The company is riding eight consecutive years of overall same-store sales gains. McDonald&apos;s usually also sees an increase in business during the summer and typically staffs up in advance.
 
&quot;One of the things we&apos;ve learned is if you put the people on, the business will come,&quot; Fields said.

For example, the company found that if a drive-thru line is too long, a customer who is in a hurry likely will go somewhere else.

The company has attempted large-scale hiring efforts before, in each of the last two years in the western U.S. Last year, McDonald&apos;s said, there were 65,000 applications for 13,000 jobs.

If Jimmy McKinney, of Chicago&apos;s Rogers Park neighborhood, is a benchmark for millennials—people ages 18 to 29—McDonald&apos;s and other restaurant chains face hurdles to acceptance.

McKinney, a 25-year-old Loyola University graduate student, acknowledged his prejudice about working for McDonald&apos;s but said he&apos;s not interested in working for Starbucks either. He&apos;s aiming for a teaching job when he completes his history degree, although he hasn&apos;t ruled out pursuing a doctorate.

&quot;It&apos;s the stereotype of flipping burgers,&quot; he said.

If he needed to get a job right away, McKinney said, he&apos;d rather work for a mom-and-pop operation than a major corporation. He said retail would have an edge, especially a store like REI, as he spent three years managing a similar shop.

McKinney said he hasn&apos;t been tempted by Starbucks&apos; health benefits because his father owns a business, and he&apos;s covered under its policy.

&quot;If that was my No. 1 priority, then I&apos;d probably work for Starbucks over a mom-and-pop,&quot; he said.
