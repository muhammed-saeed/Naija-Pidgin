 About Us 
  
The Blockhouse has been a local favorite in Greenville since 1981. I would like to thank you for giving us so many years of success. Without your input into our restaurant over the years, we would never be where we are today.Our only goal is to serve the finest quality food available in a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. We&apos;ll never be a fast-food restaurant, but what we do offer is something they can&apos;t touch - the best quality.

 
All our food is made from scratch, always using the best ingredients possible. We hand-pat our burgers. We make our quiche every morning. All our soups are made from scratch, using fresh seafood or beef or chicken. We age all our choice meats in house and hand-cut all our steaks. They are never frozen or prepackaged. So it takes a little longer for us to prepare your meal, don&apos;t worry. You know you&apos;re getting the best.

 ***Introducing our new outdoor dining area. Come see the &quot;Back Deck&quot;, It may have taken us a while to add this... but it will be a welcomed addition to the Blockhouse!***
