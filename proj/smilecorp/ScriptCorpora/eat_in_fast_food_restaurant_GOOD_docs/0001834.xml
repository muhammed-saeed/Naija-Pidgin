Academic Writing Sample Task 1 #45
 

 Tuesday, 14 August 2007 
 
 
You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

 The charts below show the percentage of their food budget the average 
family spent on restaurant meals in different years. The graph shows the number 
of meals eaten in fast food restaurants and sit-down restaurants. 

You should write at least 150 words.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own 
knowledge or experience.

 
 


model answer:

Over the past 30 years, the average family has dramatically increased the number 
of meals that they eat at restaurants. The percentage of the family&apos;s food 
budget spent on restaurant meals steadily climbed. Just 10 percent of the food 
budget was spent on restaurant meals in 1970, and 15 percent in 1980. That 
percentage more than doubled in 1990, to 35 percent, and rose again in 2000 to 
50 percent.

Where families eat their restaurant meals also changed during that 30-year 
period. In 1970, families ate the same number of meals at fast food and sit-down 
restaurants. In 1980, families ate slightly more frequently at sit-down 
restaurants. However, since 1990, fast food restaurants serve more meals to the 
families than do the sit-down restaurants. Most of the restaurant meals from 
2000 were eaten at fast food restaurants. If this pattern continues, eventually 
the number of meals that families eat at fast food restaurants could double the 
number of meals they eat at sit-down restaurants.
