Fast food chains selling alcohol!?!?
 Next Discussion» From: Master_debater Posted: Jul-01 09:01 PM (1 of 92) 
 
 
 More chains are serving alcohol to help boost sales. 

 Some Burger King locations are already selling beer. 

 Sonic will start serving beer and wine at the end of the summer, at two of its Miami-area restaurants. 
 And, wine is on the menu at some Starbucks in Seattle .

I think this is pure idiocy..what are your thoughts.

Well, if your at a fast food place your most likely driving home. So yea I would say its a pretty bad idea.
 From: bugmama To: ALL Posted: Jul-01 09:05 PM via the iPhone app (3 of 92) 
Ya, sounds like it promotes drinking&amp;driving to me. How did they ever come to the conclusion that this was a good idea!?!!
 From: MoreAwesome To: Master_debater Posted: Jul-01 09:06 PM (4 of 92) 
i agreee! complete idiocy! i think all this is going to do is give those chains more sales, and put more intoxicated drivers on the road. as if there are not enough people who drink and drive, they are going to make it easier to drink and drive.

i mean i really want to hear the cahsier ask me&quot;would you like a beer with your order?&quot;ya that totally makes me so happy. (complete sarcasm here)

completely ridiculous.

This is ridiculous. What is their reasoning for doing it?
 From: Master_debater To: ellesbelles7 Posted: Jul-01 09:16 PM (6 of 92) 
To boost sales.

It makes me angry..

Meh. They&apos;ve sold beer/wine at some taco fast food places in Dallas for years. Just because fast-food is like a&apos;restaurant lite&apos;, it&apos;s still a restaurant. I don&apos;t have an issue with it.

Haha can I get a woot woot! But seriously lol how are they gonna work that with the drive thrus? In store only? Personally I don&apos;t see it being much different then any restaurant selling booze.

The article makes it sound like a bad idea but in my opinion, it isn&apos;t new. For example, chipotle in my area sells beer. The article mentioned that pizza huts have had liquor sales for years. As long as the fast food restaurant does not sell to drive thru/drive in customers and follows the state laws, they should be able to. My only concern is that many current fast food employees are not old enough to be serving alcohol to meet some state laws.

Eh. When I lived in Germany the McDonalds and Burger Kings had beer on the menu. I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s all that different from going to a regular restaurant and ordering alcohol. 

Now, if you&apos;re going through the drive-thru, that&apos;s another story. And considering the whole point of Sonic is you eat in your car, than yeah, that&apos;s stupid for them to offer wine.
 From: crazypants To: Samanthar6 Posted: Jul-01 09:19 PM via the iPhone app (11 of 92) 
Because people that go to full-service restaurants aren&apos;t typically driving home?

First sounds like a terrible combo. I wouldn&apos;t want a beer with my McDonald&apos;s....Eww gross. Second, as DH and I were discussing he made a good point - if you have a drive thru you shouldn&apos;t be serving alcohol. I&apos;ll have an occasional drink or two if we go out to dinner and I will drive home.....I&apos;m not there to get sloshed and on those nights we may be at the restaurant with friends for 3+ hours.....a little different than pounding some beers and big macs in my opinion.

Wait, why is this idiocy?

Meh. I don&apos;t see a big deal. Restaurants serve alcohol, fast food is a restaurant. Its not the restaurants fault if people drive drunk, they are adults capable of making choices. Just because it&apos;s available doesn&apos;t mean you get a free pass.
 From: TAFKASemiCrunchie To: Master_debater Posted: Jul-01 09:38 PM (15 of 92) 
Surely they won&apos;t serve through the drive thru right? If they only serve it for dine in then I don&apos;t see the difference in taco bell and cholos serving beer.

I think the difference between alcohol at a sit-down restaurant and alcohol at a fast food chain is you have time to have a beer or one drink with your meal, and it&apos;s already pretty much out of your system by the time you&apos;re finished eating your meal at sit-down restaurant.

It usually takes me MAYBE 20 minutes at most to eat a meal at a fast food joint.


With that said, I think they&apos;re promoting drinking and driving, and possibly making alcohol more easily accessible to minors, as well as adding more shi*tty things to the sh*tty meal you&apos;re already eating.

But hey, if it brings in money - who cares?!

Money is an evil thing..
 From: AvaNZoesMom To: ALL Posted: Jul-01 09:42 PM via the iPhone app (17 of 92) 
I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best idea, but I agree with others, that in a way it&apos;s almost like any other restaurant selling alcohol. I mean most people drive to restaurants, drink and drive home.
 From: 1236547 To: crazypants Posted: Jul-01 09:42 PM (18 of 92) 
Oooh! I may have a decent rebuttal to that! (Of course that&apos;s up for debate ha!)

Check out my post right before this.

Chipotle serves beer. My SO always gets one and so do I when not pregnant. Never more than one each. I can&apos;t imagine some finishing one and going up to get another. You drink one with your burrito and leave. No harm done.
 From: INmomma2b To: ALL Posted: Jul-01 09:50 PM via the Android app (20 of 92) 
I don&apos;t see it as any different than gas stations selling carry out beer or better yet the drive thru liqour stores I used to see in Ohio. I wouldn&apos;t think you could get anything but sealed carry out bottles/cans to ideally drink when you get home.
 From: SexyNamesR4Uglies To: Master_debater Posted: Jul-01 09:51 PM via the iPhone app (21 of 92) 
I don&apos;t see the big deal. Actually we even have drive through daiquiri&apos;s here.
