 Assaggio Bistro 
 June 8th, 2012 
 Overall Review : 

 Service: The service was very good at Assaggio’s Bistro in Kahala. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and she went out of her way to make sure we had a good experience. The support staff was also very good and they were quick to clear our plates and fill up our water glasses.

 Food: The food was pretty tasty but the menu is far to big and overwhelming with over 4 pages of entrees to choose from. The menu has typical italian items that you would expect including plenty of pastas (lignuine, fettchini or rigatoni), house specialites, steaks, veal, seafood, etc. If you go we would absolutly recommend ordering pasta with your entree as we did not care for the potatoes (they were suppose to be crispy but were far from it). A safe bet is to order anything with the fried garlic as both the vegetables we had as an appetizer as well as the fresh fish pasta were both to die for (mostly due to the fried garlic morsels). We recommend skipping the salads as they are not very exciting and kind of a waste of calories and unless your going to share your entree the small size portion is plenty for any0ne!!

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Fish Pasta with Garlic&amp;Butter, Chicken Alla Parmigiana, Fresh Asparagus Sautéed with Olive Oil and Garlic (was delicious but not a lot of asparagus for the price).

 Atmosphere: The ambiance at Assaggio’s Bistro in Kahala is nice. The inside has high ceilings and interesting artwork on the walls. It’s has a cozy feeling to it while still having ample seating which is always hard to achieve. The best part is that it has good insulation making it easy to enjoy table conversation without having to raise your voice. Its a good place to bring family for a night out on the town.

 Consistency: We have only been once so far to this location but we will update this section after our next visit!

 Parking: In terms of parking if you get lucky you can park out front which has about 10 spots that are shared with some other vendors. Or if you cant find parking in the lot or on the street you can always park accross the street at Ala Moana shopping center and walk.

 Price: medium-high ($16-$29) per Entree 
Corkage Fee: Wine $15 per Bottle (can’t bring wine that they have on their wine list) and for Champaign price starts at $20 per Bottle and goes up depending on the brand.
Reservations Not Needed (Perhaps for a large party its a good idea)

 Dave&amp;Busters 
 April 6th, 2012 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is not bad at Dave&amp;Busters at Ward Centers but its all about timing and location. The bottom restaurant has pretty good service and is more formal while the upstairs is not quite as reliable but it is almost like an extension of the bar, much more casual. Regardless where you sit the staff is usually pretty friendly and young (this isnt always a good thing). We have had some pretty bad serivcie as well…but its pretty rare so we will leave the gorey details out.

 Foo d: Dave&amp;Busters certainly isn’t going to win any awards for mouth watering food but it is consistant. It’s like dinner food, its good but its not something you fantasize about later and can’t wait to go and order again. The typical things you find on the menu are…(you guessed it) Hambergers, Fish, Sandwiches, Salads, Ribs, Fries, Wings, Steaks…bar food that could use a bit more seasoning overall! The best part is that there is something for everyone. They do have happy hour and some special events like Taco Tuesday which is fun and worth checking out for some drinks, music and grinds with friends. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: French Fries, Spinach Dip, Fire Grilled Salmon, Baby Back Ribs and Apple Pecan Salad. 

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is nice both upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs dinning is quieter and nice and bright with large glass windows and high ceilings. Upstairs is more of a game room / bar feel like a dark whole in the wall. The seating upstairs is booth style and is more of what you would expect at a traditional arcade. Dave’n&apos;Busters also has a top roof bar which is very nice and tropical with a cool breeze and partially covered roof. 

 Consistency: They are very consistency average. You get what you are expecting most of the time but there have been a few low points in the past 5 years, and fewer high points were they surprise you with something“out of the box”delicious. 

 Parking : Parking is one of the best reasons to go to Dave’n&apos;Busters at Ward Centers. They have ample parking at Ward Centers for free. If you get frustrated on a busy weekend (the movie theater is right next to the restaurant so some weekends can get a bit crazy) for $5 you can park in valet on the second floor of the parking structure.

 Gordon Biersch 
 March 2nd, 2012 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is usually  good at Gordon Biersh but it can be slow when it gets really busy you just have to hope you get a good waiter. The appetizers come out pretty quickly so order some for the table when you site down so you don’t get fussy (Oh and a few drinks!).

 Foo d: The food is pretty good at Gordon Bierch in Honolulu. It’s nothing fancy or really exciting but its classic American food and it delivers on its promise. The ingredients are fresh and prepared with care. It’s a great place to go with kids and their is truly something on the menu for everyone.  They also have a great Happy Hour Mon-Wed (4-6:30pm) with discounted appetizers only $5-$11 range and $1-$2 OFF Lagers, Ales and Wines by the glass. To top it off you can get a premium cocktail for only $5 making this a local favorite hangout.

 Favorite Dishes: Southwest Egg Rolls, Gorgonzola Pear Salad, Southwest Chicken Sandwhich, Fresh Fish, Cajun Pasta, New York Strip (with Gorgonzola!), Burgers, Garlic Fries, Beers of course!

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at Gordon Biersch is awesome AND it was the first brewery in Hawaii. They are located right on the water and the view is both pristine and amazing. They have live music most evenings and its always a happening place to go with friends for dinner or pupus after work. Even lunch is nice and relaxing…it’s the perfect place to go for a stay-cation and enjoy Hawaii like you where on holiday.

 Consistency: It’s pretty consistently fun and good. Whenever you go you get what you are expecting and our nieces and nephews love it.

 Parking : The offer validated parking at Gordon Beirsch for 3 hours. If you valet you still have to pay a percentage of the total even WITH a validation so keep that in mind.

First you must wash, peel and dice both the russet potatoes and kabocha squash, place them into a pot with a touch of salt, cover with a lid, and bring to a boil and cook until tender. Drawn the water out and then add the butter, salt&amp;pepper and mash together well. Set the potatoes aside. Next take the meat and place it into a pot on the stove on medium to high heat. Cook the meat until its brown and then remove from the heat and pour out excess grease. Then add the onion, mushrooms, garlic, ginger, beef base, salt and pepper and mix together. Next add the Campbell’s soup along with ½ a can of water, stir the ingredients well. Finally take a 13” x 9” Pyrex dish and pour the meat mixture inside on the bottom. Then grab your mashed potatoes and smear evenly on top of the meat mixture. Top with shredded Parmesan cheese and then bake in the oven for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

 Nothing To Wine About! 
 December 13th, 2011 
 Wine comes in many white and red varieties including but not limited to–Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Riesling,  Pinot Noir, Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon and is used as both a food accompaniment (enhancer) or as a flavor agent in stocks or braising. Wine has been used throughout history in various religious celebrations as well as family gatherings to bring people closer together to enjoy life and culture. Being a Private Chef I’m a lover of all wine and how it enhances the taste and flavor of food. Below are some tips on how to explore both red and white wine in your cooking techniques.

 Red Wine Cooking Tip: Using red wine is a fantastic way to add depth and richness to your sauces. Start by reducing the wine to cook out the alcohol flavor. Then add other ingredients such as garlic, onions and some type of stock. Let flavors infuse by allowing to simmer for about 30 mintues. Serve over any dish to add your unique flavor profile.

 White Wine Cooking Tip: Use white wine to create a fantastic butter sauce. By using the same wine you are going to serve with dinner you can add a second note of flavor by adding a splash of that same wine to your sauce, risotto, or sautéed seafood.

 Health Benefits: Red wine in particular is packed full of polyphernols which have antioxidant characteristics and if consumed in moderate amounts are directly associated with decrease in cardiovascular death (heart attack) by 30-50%. Red wine also contains resveratrol which is found in the grape skins and seeds and increases the HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and prevents the LDL (bad cholesterol) from forming – meaning it can help reduce blood clots or blood vessel damage caused from fat deposits . Wine has been said to reduce the risk or help with the following conditions: Cardiovascular Disease, Blood Clots, Plaque formation in the arteries, Lung Cancer (in men), and Alzhimer’s Diseases. So why not join the vine vine and enjoy a small glass of wine daily its nothing to WHINE about. Cheers to your health!

 Harbor Pub&amp;Pizza 
 November 25th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The Service was average at Harbor Pub&amp;Pizza. The waitress was friendly and remembered our order which is all I guess we can really hope for a hole in the wall bar. The place could have used a good scrub down (specially the bathrooms yikes!) but overall it was ok. That being said, we have had friends who have had pretty bad service so its really a crap shoot.

 Foo d: The food is ok at Harbor Pub&amp;Pizza in Waikiki. They are known for their pizza (hence the name of the establishment) and what’s nice is you can order a half / half of different kinds of pizza so everyone at the table wins! They also serve brunch which is nice but if you go we would recommend sticking to the pizza&amp;salads.

 Favorite Dishes: Spinach&amp;Garlic Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and Greek Salad

 Atmosphere : Ok to be perfectly honest its a dive bar. Nothing fancy about it and thats ok because it doesn’t promise to be. They have a small bar and about 5-7 tables in the back. There are a few large TV’s which they play sports and surfing on so its a good place to go if you are super hung over and want to hid from the world and not be seen my anyone you know.

 Consistency: We have been a few times for drinking and its consistently a hole in the wall. However, it’s fun and has a good crowed. This is the type of place you go for a very low key drink and snack and you def get what your expecting as long as you don’t expect to much!

 Parking : Harbor Pub&amp;Pizza has validated parking or you can park in metered spaces across the street close to the Ala Moana Harbor.

 I Love Olive Oil 
 November 16th, 2011 
 Olive Oil has been consumed since before 4000BC and is the only vegetable oil that can be consumed fresh as it is i.e.  juice from pressing olives. There are a few varieties of olive oil from extra virgin to extra light, which vary on quality and  process. I’m going to share some private chef tips on when to use each type of olive oil for optimal cooking and food enhancement.

 Extra Virgin Olive Oil Cooking Tip: Extra virgin olive oil is the highest quality because it is the least processed form and is procured from the first pressing of the olives and contains no more than .8% acidity. This type of olive oil has the most superiors taste and should be used for finishing foods such as to create salad dressing, soups, pasta, or to just enjoy bread with some balsamic. Basically you shouldn’t use Extra Virgin olive oil to cook anything as it is really a waste, it should be added before you serve a hot item or to cold preparations to enhance the food.

 Virgin Olive Oil Cooking Tip: Virgin olive oil is from the second pressing of the olives and has an acidly level of less than 2%. Pure olive oil undergoes some processing such as filtering and refining which results in a product which lacks strong flavor. This type of oil should be used for sauces, or anything sauteed such as fish, or vegetables because extra virgin olive smokes when it gets to hot and burns which damages the flavor of the olive oil. Use virgin to saute items as a vehicle to enhance the other items flavor no to be the lead flavor.

 Extra Light Olive Oil Tip: Light olive oil undergoes more processing and retains only a mild flavor of the olive and in some cases is even mixed with other oils. My tip is just say no to light olive oil. It doesn’t contain the same antioxidants, flavor, and isn’t lighter in calories so just seems like a waste of time to use.

 Health Benefits: Olive oil has a multitude of health benefits because it is a monounsaturated fatty acid and has antioxidative properties. Studies have shown that olive oil can help fight heart disease by controlling the LDL (“bad”) cholesterol while increasing the HDL “Good” cholesterol levels. All olive oil contains monounsaturated fats, however, the least processed extra virgin olive oil is the most healthy because it contains the highest levels of antioxidants, including vitamin E, carotenoids, and oleuropein which is said to strengthen the immune system. Olive oil is a healing fat and is delicate on the stomach because its easy to digest and can have positive effect on ulcers and gastritis because it activates the secretion of bile and pancreatic hormones naturally in the body. Olive Oil has been said to reduce the risk or help with Colon Cancer, Ulcers, Gastritis, Heart Disease and Cholesterol. So substitute butter for oil and say I-love olive oil!

 Chart House Waikiki 
 November 2nd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was applaudable at the Chart House in Waikiki. From the hostess to the table back the staff really was professional, friendly and worked like a well oiled machine. We never had empty water glasses or dishes on the table the whole night and it was really refreshing. They also gave us a complementary Mudd Pie since it was me and my wifes one year anniversary which was delicious and very thoughtful.

 Foo d: The food was delicious and we ate every single morsel of food they put in front of us. The menu has traditional items you would expect to have at a steakhouse including lots of seafood and proteins. The food was really flavorful and worth the price (the Alaskan crab legs where a bit steep at $66.50 for 4 claws but they where super tasty and if you are looking to treat yourself for a special occasion go for it). We recommend getting a few appetizers and sharing with the table to try a few different items. One nice thing to point out is each entree comes WITH a starter salad or soup and side dishes one starch and one vegetable which is really nice and not a-typical for steakhouses who charge ala cart for these items. Finally they also have happy hour from opening to 7pm and 10pm to closing so its a great place for afterwork or late night pupus and drinks with friends. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Sizzling Szechawn Shrimp, Escargot, Whole fried fish (yummy could have eaten two), Crab Claws (great but very expensive $5 per a bit), and the Chart House Waikiki Mudd Pie (best we have ever had!).

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at Chart House is just fantastic. The restaurant is right on the water and overlooks the yacht harbor in Waikiki. Its beautiful to watch the boats during the day and at night. The decor is old hawaiianan and the inside of the restaurant is dressed in warm wood tones. Some nights they have live entertainment and ALWAY a full bar! One positive note is that the restaurant is large enough so intimate diners don’t have to be bothered by the rowdy bar goers.

 Consistency: We haven’t been to eat at the chart house in a long time but have had good pupus and drinks in the past few years. However, with this surprisingly great dinning experience it won’t be long until we go again.

 Parking : The chart house has a parking garage which validates and they also have metered parking out front.

 The Love of Tomatoes! 
 October 24th, 2011 
 Tomato’s can be eaten in a variety of different ways including raw, cooked, stewed, fried, juiced, or as a sauce. Although tomatoes are classified as a fruit when using them in a culinary fashion they are considered a vegetable because of their savory flavor. One of my favorite private chef tips is to use tomatoes in both there raw and cooked form because the texture, flavor and overall taste is so unique in both preparations.

 Cooking Raw Tomato Tip: Add a little salt to your raw tomatoes and they will become much brighter and plump in flavor. Try a piece of Wassa complex carb hard bread, Tomato and light Cheese for a healthy breakfast start to your day.

 Cooking Cooked Tomato Tips: Roasting tomatoes in the oven gives them a rich and full flavor.  Try roasting some vine tomatoes in the oven with olive oil and salt for about 45 minutes, peal the skin off once complete and blend to create delicious sauces, dips or spreads to accompany your meals!

 Health Benefits: The tomato is excellent for your health and is often praised for benefiting your heart as well as many key organs because it contains one of the most powerful natural antioxidants called lycopene. Lycopene is not naturally found in the body but has the ability to flush out free radicals that build up and cause cellular breakdown and cancer. No other fruit or vegetable has as high a concentration of this powerful antioxidant as the tomato and studies show that eating specifically cooked tomatoes (more lycopene in cooked than raw) can help prevent numerous types of cancer, heart disease, and even neurodegenerative disease. Just 1 cup (or in our case pint glass!) of powerful has 59 calories, 29% of your daily vitamin c, 17% of your daily vitamin a, lycopene, calcium and iron making it a great low fat snack or condiment. Tomatoes have been said to help with or reduce the risk of Prostate cancer, Heart, Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Colon Cancer, Reduce Blood Pressure, Rectal Cancer, Stomach Cancer, Mouth Cancer, Neck cancer, and Neurodegenerative diseases.

 Cha Cha Cha Salsaria 
 October 21st, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is very good at Cha Cha Cha Salsaria in Hawaii Kai. The staff is really genuine and super nice. Both times we have been so far they where very attentive and you could really feel that they where excited to service you. Unfortunately the manager we can’t say the same thing about. We had two coupons which we thought expired in 2012 but turned out to expire in 2011. It was 5 weeks expired and we asked if we could use just one of the two by any chance (totaling $25). We understand they are expired but we ordered plenty of food and drinks and they already got the money from us for the GC’s so its not like it would have hurt them financially to let us use at least one of them. The server was so sweet and really stuck up for us. The manager however had a stick up his you know what!

 Foo d: The food is hit or miss at Cha Cha Cha. The cobb cajun shrimp salad was terrific and the salsa was to die for (both types both Pineapple and regular) where fresh and had a really good bite. The enchilada and tacos however where pretty average. The enchilada casing was kind of gummy and even the salsa verde wasn’t very memorable. They do have a Happy Hour Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and brunch on Sundays which is nice so maybe come for drinks (the perfect margarita was terrific) and just enjoy some pupus and the view. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Cobb Cajun Shrimp Salad, Free Salsa, Margarita

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at Cha Cha Cha Salsaria is by far the best thing going for this restaurant. It’s located on the Harbor in Hawaii Kai right next to The Shack and is just beautiful. The restaurant has both inside and outside seating and guests are invited to grab a menu and find there own seats which is nice and feels empowering. The inside has mexican themed artwork and a cute little bar. It’s absolutely a good place to meet friends for a casual bite or drinks while enjoying the sunset and beautiful Hawaii weather.

 Consistency: Both times we have been the margaritas and shrimp salad where just delicious. The other items where nothing special but may have been consistent we are not sure because we didn’t give them a second chance. We hear that brunch is good so will try that and update this review.

 Parking : Cha Cha Cha’s has free parking at the Hawaii Kai shopping plaza so you shouldnt have trouble getting a spot unless you go on the weekend and fight with Safeway shoppers.

 4 Tropical Creme Brulee Flavor Creations 
 October 7th, 2011 
 Ingredients 
1 quart heavy cream
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
1 cup vanilla sugar, divided
6 large egg yolks
2 quarts hot water
 

 Flavors 
2 single serving packets of Nescafe Tasters Choice Instant Coffee
3 table spoons of The Perfect Puree Of Napa Valley–Passion Fruit Gourmet Concentrate
Half Package of Chaokoh Coconut Milk Powder
1 Package of Land Lakes Cocoa Hot Cocoa Mix

 Directions 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Place the cream, vanilla bean and its pulp into a saucepan set over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil. Next remove it from the heat and cover it and let sit for about 15 minutes. After its sit remove the vanilla bean and set it aside for another use.

Next take out medium size bowl and whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended (it will start to lighten in color once ready). Now take the cream and add a little at a time to the mixture stirring continually. Now divide the mixture into 4 equal parts (in different bowls) and add the flavor components (one to each bowl) listed above. Next pour the liquid into 12 (4-ounce) ramekins (if you have different size ramekins thats ok you will just have fewer creme brulees). Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Now for the fun part…Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 15-30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top.

 

Divide the remaining 1/2 cup vanilla sugar equally among the 12 remekins and spread evenly on top.

 

Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top.

 

 

Allow the creme brulee to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.

 

Enjoy! for additional fun you can put the creme brulee flavors into chinese spoons, add sugar, and then torch them for parties or smaller treats. You can also serve them with a fresh fruit topping. This is one of Private Chef Ryan Covert’s specialties and always a hit for guests and locals alike.

 Monsoon India 
 October 4th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Monsoon India for the most part. Our waiter was really polite and all the staff was friendly and pleasant.

 Foo d: The food at Monsoon India on Ala Moana Blv in Honolulu was average but nothing sensational. The menu has typical indian items such as Curry, Tandoori breads such as Naan and Roti, Samosas, Tandoori Meats, Paneer, Biriyani , and other indian classics. The grilled meat Kababs assortment we tried had chicken, shrimp and lamb and was overall very dry. The Naan was super crunchy and was missing the chewiness it typically has which is great for mopping up yummy sauce&amp;curry. The Vindaloo curry was the best thing we tried with Mahi Mahi and had great heat, however, there was only 2 tiny little pieces of fish and the rest was all potatoes. Also something to point out was they didn’t have that yellow rice option with saffron on the menu and only had Basmati rice which was ok but a bit oily overall. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Papadamu, and Fish Vindaloo

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is nice at Monsoon and homey. It has some indian artwork and other ethnic touches . The restaurant is small and only has about 10-15 tables total. The restaurant overlooks the Ala Moana blvd street which isn’t to pretty but does bring alot of light and airiness into the restaurant ambiance.

 Consistency: We have only been once since it changed from Bombay India to Monsoon India and if we return we will update this blog…however, we still feel that Cafe Maharani is the best Indian food in Hawaii so will most likely not come back to Monsoon India anytime soon to satisfy a Indian food itch!

 Parking : Monsoon Restaurant has validated parking available at the Discovery Bay building, on the Ocean side of Ala Moana Blvd in Honolulu. You shouldn’t try to find street parking because the parking at the Discovery Bay is super convenient and the elevator goes directly to the level with the restaurant.

 Plumeria Beach House 
 September 23rd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Plumeria the Kahala Hotel. The staff are very professional and helpful going above and beyond to accommodate customer needs.

 Foo d: The food is pretty good at this restaurant but more recommended for lunch rather than dinner. They have an interesting assortment of dishes with an American / Japanese / Global /Fusion flare to them. The menu has a good assortment of pupus, salads, soups, sandwiches and entree’s so sure to be a hit with both kids and adults. They also have a really large buffet for breakfast on the weekends which is so so (not as good as it used to be since they got ride of the fresh crab legs and other delicious sushi options) but its still a nice place to go for a family gathering or to take some visiting friends. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: The Kahala Hamburger is really good and served with a fried egg (you can also ask for it with salad instead of fries which we recommend because its very heavy), same goes for the Garden Burger very good, plumeria fish tacos, lunch special of the day and salads.

 Atmosphere : The best thing about the Plumeria restaurant is the ambiance and the view! its breathtaking and overlooks the pristine ocean. The table layout allows for you to site both indoor and outdoor (under tent) and is very well organized and has excellent acoustics (not to loud even when its a full house). Also the Kahala hotel has live dolphins and have great shows making this a good place to bring kids for an after lunch experience.

 Consistency: Its consistently average…nothing really that you crave or would go out of your way to go to eat…but the view is always amazing and a great experience each time you visit.

 Parking : The Kahala Hotel has valet parking which you can get validated by eating at Plumeria and only pay $5 or you can also park yourself in the visitors garage which is free with validation for a few hours.

 Izakaya Nonbei 
 September 13th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : Izakaya Nonbei used to be one of our all time favorite Japanese restaurants in Hawaii, however, last year it was sold and has changed substantially. One of the past owners is still working for the restaurant and she assured me that the cook was the same (although the main chef was her father so we are not sure how they could be if they moved?). When the food arrived about 30% of the dishes where as good as we remembered but the rest of the food was disappointing. When we asked to return a horribly overcooked fish she took it back to the kitchen and then returned it to us saying“the chef touched it and said its moist inside”…. first and foremost no one wants to hear that someone touched there food and then expect them to continue to eat it! secondly we know overcooked fish when we see and taste it. It was disappointing service for sure. Specially when the past owners where so nice and the food was impeccable.

 Foo d: The food was so so. Someone who has never been to the Old Nonbei may think its great, but after years of patronage we feel the food has suffered in the transition. Some of the items are still good so if you are in the neighborhood and in the mood for sushi or Japanese by all means go….. but if you have been an old Nonbei fan say so long and just move onto another Japanese restaurant. Even the green tea was different–must be a cheaper brand.

 Favorite Dishes: Karei Karaag (Cabbage&amp;Small fish) Eggplant&amp;Mushrooms, Miso Rice Cake, Small Fried Shrimp Appetizer and the ice Otokoyama sake of course!

 Atmosphere : The new Nonbei ambiance is kind of modern inside. They have ground floor tables as well as regular tables and the inside is very small (about 5-6 tables total) plus the small sushi bar. The real killer is that they have a huge flat screen TV on the wall which really detracts for the restaurants classiness. Honestly who wants to go to a nice restaurant and have to watch TV? its distracting and doesn’t belong in this restaurant at all.

 Consistency: Well the old Nonbei was incredible consistence for years, however, this new location isn’t going to get a second chance from us anytime soon. If we do for some reason feel generous we will go back and update this restaurant review!

 Parking : Nonbei has a small parking lot out front with about 10 spots in total. When full it can be super hard to get in and out but at least they do have some parking. Otherwise you can always park across the street at Safeway and walk across the street.

 Salt Kitchen&amp;Tasting Bar 
 September 5th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was ok at Salt. Our waiter started off a little stiff but improved throughout the evening. The staff was friendly overall.

 Foo d: The food was good at Salt Kitchen&amp;Tasting Bar on Waialae avenue. The menu consists of tapas and a few burger/ sandwiches. The tapas are not spanish in theme but more like a mixture of fusion and italian with items like cheese&amp;meat plates, ahi bites, stuffed tuna peppers, fried egg, fresh beet and arugula salads, and some other interesting and unique items like the pork stuffed calamari. It’s the type of place you go with a group and share so you can try a little of this, and a little of that. They also have a large wine list (but where out of a few key choices)–keep in mind the corkage fee is a whopping $50 per a bottle! the highest so far in Hawaii we have encountered so you are better off drinking what the restaurant has to offer. Also we noticed that sometimes it was cheaper to drink the wines by the glass than to order a bottle which was pretty strange so watch out for that as well. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Beet Salad, Cheese&amp;Fig plate, Fried Egg, Daily Crudo, Chevre cheesecake with Caramel Popcorn and the wine of course!

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is nice at Salt. THe downstairs i like a big sushi bar which seats facing the kitchen and the only table seating is upstairs and is very limited, only about 6-8 tables. The artwork is black and white photographs that where cool a few years ago (trendy) but a little out of touch now…they also have some interesting colored pig paintings which give the room a pop of color and really work with the black and white decor.

 Consistency: So far so good! both times we have been to Salt the food has been very interesting and good overall.

 Parking : You can park in the Kaimuki shopping center for a pretty minor fee of about $1 per an hour (or on the side closest to Big City Dinner they have metered parking which is more expensive but also close by). If you are lucky you can find some street parking on Waialae but its not easy!

 Turkey Meatball Lollipops 
 September 1st, 2011 
 Serves: 6-8 People
 Cooking Time: 45 minutes

 Ingredients: 
1 (1.25lb) Pack Foster Farm Ground Turkey (93%/7% Lean)
1 Pack Fresh Turkey Italian Sausage Hot&amp;Spicy
1 Small Sweet White Onion, minced
1 ½ Cup Aged Gouda Cheese, grated
2 Eggs
6 Cloves Garlic, minced
10 Basil Leafs, minced
2 Tablespoons Fresh Parsley, minced
1 Tablespoons Italian Seasoning
½ Teaspoon Black Pepper
½ Teaspoon Salt
Serve with – BBQ Sauce or Store Bought Tomato Sauce
Lollipop Sticks (Optional)

 Directions: 
Preheat the oven to 400° and then start by grabbing a large mixing bowl and adding the ground turkey meat. Now take the Italian sausage out of its casing and combined the meats together. Next add all the rest of the ingredients to the mixing bowl including the onion, garlic, eggs, basil, parsley, cheese, Italian seasoning, pepper and salt and use your hands to blend everything together well. Next take a small muffin tin or baking sheet (if you use a baking sheet make sure you line it with tin foil first) and spray with Pam or any non-stick cooking spray. Now start forming your mixture into meatballs about a golf ball in size and place them into the muffin tin and bake in oven for 20 minutes. Take them out of the oven and let them cool for a minute or two. You can either serve these meatballs as a fantastic pupu with BBQ dipping sauce (on lollipop sticks for fun) or use them in a traditional spaghetti and meatballs entrée with your favorite tomato sauce.

 Jade Dynasty 
 August 29th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Jade Dynasty. Our waiter was a little pushy but in a nice way. He was attentive and went out of his way to let me know all the items on the menu that contained MSG which I really appreciated and made me trust this chinese restaurant above others in town. The last time we went , however, the food took forever to arrive! after about 50 minutes we had only recieved 2 dishes and had to ask for the rest in a doggy bag to make an appoinment.

 Foo d: The food was good at Jade Dynasty overall. The vegetables where really well seasoned and cooked. For lunch they have traditional dim sum selections and you can also order off the menu. For dinner there is no dim sum but they have lots of  items include chicken (lemon, cold, general tao’s, kung po, etc), peking duck, noodles, rice, pork, seafood (fresh crab, shrimp, prawns, whole steamed fish, lobster etc) , tofu and of course chinese vegetable dishes! We found the food very tasty overall but the most memorable items where the Choy Sum and Stir-Fry String Beans as they where extra crispy and fresh. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Dim Sum– Fresh shrimp&amp;spinach dumplings, signature shrimp dumplings, seafood bean curd roll, steamed BBQ pork buns, Dinner–Stir-fry minced meat with string beans and chii sauce (yummy!), Choy Sum with garlic sauce, and the curry Singaporean rice noodles.

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is very clean and grand inside. The ceilings are extremely high and decorated with chandlers giving the restaurant an open feeling as well as reduce the noise factor when busy during the dim sum rush. The decor is black, gold and red and they have very limited artwork inside. The restaurant is large overall and has plenty of tables for larger groups as well as booth seating, in fact they have 7 private rooms available making this a great place to book a party!

 Consistency: We have only been twice so far, once for dim sum and once for dinner…so far so good on the food! the owners of the Jade Dynasty also own 20 restaurants in Hong Kong so they must know what they are doing. However, the second time the service was super slow sooo hopefully that was just a fluke

 Parking : Jade Dynasty is located at the Ala Moana shopping center so there is plenty of free parking at your finger tips. The restaurant is located close to Mai Tai bar and the parking right outside Norstroms on the third level. We recommend parking there and then taking the elevator or escalator next to Pearl to the restaurant on the fourth floor (3 above ground).

 Yellow Tail Shiraz 
 August 28th, 2011 
 Overall Wine Review: 

 Varietal: Syrah/Shiraz

 Vintages: 2008

 Country: South Eastern Australia

 Essence of : Vanilla&amp;Oak undertones are apparent on the noise and pallet once the wine opens up after a minute or two. The overall taste is earthy and pleasant for the price. It’s a tad sweet and has mild tannins. The color is dark and rich almost magenta and this is a good option for a heavy drinking nights with friends as the price is right!

 Best Served With : Grilled Meats, Tomato Based Dishes, Spicy Food like Curry

 P rice Range: $4-$6

 Cafe Maharani 
 April 5th, 2009 
 Overall : 

 Service : Service is always pretty good. The staff is really friendly but it takes forever to get a seat (well worth the wait!!) . A good tip is to bring an extra bottle of wine because they let you drink it while you wait in the back. It makes the time go much faster!

 Food : The food is traditional Indian and served family style in interesting dishes. The menu has good variety and the platters are large so share with your friends. We would recommend a few appetizers, followed by a Vegetable dish, Masala, and Meat dish like the Tandoori platter. Don’t forget the Naan and yellow rice to slurp up the last drops.

 Favorite Dishes: Papadum, Tandoori Chicken, Vegetable Masala (special dish), Fish or Chicken Masala, Yellow Rice, Naan Bread with Cilantro&amp;or Onion, Curries are also very good but occasionally the meat is tough.

 Atmosphere : The moment you walk into Cafe Maharani you are transported to India with the authentic art and bright color pallet. The restaurant is very small, unique and quaint but also very busy so expect to wait for a while (Tip: buy an extra bottle of wine to drink while you wait in the back of the restaurant) they do not take reservations.

 

 Consistency: Consistently Fantastic! This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Hawaii. Being a personal chef in Oahu I always pleasure in looking forward to going to a restaurant of this caliber. The food is delicious and always consistent.

 Parking : Parking can be found at the Down To Earth parking lot up the ramp for free or on the street. We take a cab so we can enjoy the no corkage fee and have a wonderful evening.

 Champa Thai 
 July 14th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The staff sooooo nice and they feel like family since we used to go at least once a week (although in the past year have gone less and less). Often times its very busy and takes a while to order and get a bottle opener (HINT: bring your own or buy a screw top wine).

 Food : The food has traditionally been always excellent, however the past few times we have been for both lunch and dinner the food was not as good. It must be related to the chef for the day……The menu has transitional Thai favorites like spring rolls, curries, noddles and so forth. Be warned they use MSG in the food so if your allergic tell them when you order to leave it out. The food is so good you really won’t even notice a difference.

 Favorite Dishes : Pad Seiew Chicken, Thai Beef Salad, Chicken Larb, Green Papaya Salad, Tum Yum (perfect for a cold),  All Curry with Fresh Fish is a sure thing!

 Atmosphere : It’s a good place to bring a date or go with friends. It’s very casual, quaint, quiet (no loud music), nice art, and an overall lovely little restaurant.

 Consistency : Out of the 5 years I have been going to the Waialae restaurant only 2 visits have not been consistently fantastic until just recently the past 3-4 times we have gone its been less than delicious so we moved this rating from 5 corks down to 4 (but maybe should go to 3 even). I would still recommend this restaurant but hopefully they haven’t changed all the chefs because it always used to be fantastic. Only thing we can say is each chef has their own“style”but for the most part it has been consistently good over the past half decade.

 Parking : As far as parking goes there are 3 itty bitty little free spots behind the restaurant but you can always park on the street, the bank across the street or take the bus …this place is so good it’s worth walking!!

 Cafe Tajmahal 
 April 25th, 2009 
 Overall: 

 Service : Family run business and they are running it into the ground! the waitress obviously doesn’t understand service and was probably still in high school. After a second attempt we had a another lousy experience the waiter was slow and didn’t clear any of the dirty plates away from the tables! The experience was basically its worth forgetting.

 Food : The food is just awful at the Cafe Tajmahal! The menu has the basic things you would expect at an Indian restaurant not executed well at all. The Vegetable Samosa was the best thing and it was burned on the outside. The Vegetable Masala was acceptable but pretty tasteless both times, the yellow rice comes out white, and the fish Masala was really fishy. In fact, even the most staple Indian dish–Naan Bread was terrible! both times it was doughy, oily and most likely not made in a traditional oven.

 Favorite Dishes: Vegetable Samosas, Sauces that come on the table, and and Vegetable Masala. 

 Atmosphere : Lacking, definitely could use a makeover and some TLC. The kitchen is really loud and they play the same Indian movie on a loop on two flat screen TV’s which is really distracting.

 Consistency: Although we said we would never give this restaurant another chance we did in the spirit of fairness (when we went the first time it had just opened and since then have heard good things about the food) and now strongly reinforce our original opinion that this restaurant has consistently terrible food.

 Parking : There is free parking in front but the lot is shared with other restaurants at the same location so parking is hard to find and the lot is difficult to get in and out of. You can pay $5 across the street by City Mill if the parking lot is full. Our tip go early (before 7pm) and snag a free spot!

 Sabrina’s 
 April 25th, 2009 
 Overall: 

 Service : Sabrina’s is very warm and personal since its owned by a husband and wife from Italy. Service can be slow but your are there to relax so don’t plan a meal if you have a plane to catch!

 Food : The pasta is homemade and delicious as well as the salads but the meat dishes are not the highest quality and can be rather tough. Stick to the pasta and risotto. The portions are a good size and its recommended to get a few things and share with the table.

 Favorite Dishes: Ink Pasta (OMG YUM!), Caprese Salad, Prosciutto and Melon, Chef Specials (ask for these they are always good!).

 Atmosphere : Small and quaint, pictures and post cards from Italy on the walls, homely feeling but not elegant by any means. The restaurant feels warm and personable and a nice place for a first date or a gathering with friends.

 Consistency: The pastas, risotto and salad dishes are consistently delicious!

 Parking : There is free parking in front of the restaurant but the lot is shared with other neighboring vendors so parking can be extremely hard to find. You can pay $5 across the street by City Mill if you are not lucky enough to find a spot in the free lot but its a real ripe off! Go early and take your chances with the free spots they usually fill up after 7pm.

 Arancino 
 April 26th, 2009 
 Overall: 

 Service : At the Beachwalk location the service was pretty poor. It took 20 min to get the bottle of wine that we ordered and consistently had to ask to refill the waters. It was painfully slow but the waitstaff was very friendly at least and apologetic. The Arancino’s at the Marriott was also not much better but that may be because it was an off time to each and we sat outside.

 Food : Arancino’s has a very traditional Italian menu and you shouldn’t have trouble finding something to order with all the options! The food at the Beachwalk location was cooked perfectly and although the pasta portion was rather small it tasted amazing. When we visited the Arancino’s at the Marriott the Prosciutto pizza had more fat than meat and the salad sampler was literally a bite of three types of salad. Def not worth the money so order something else.

 Favorite Dishes: Spaghetti all’arrabbiata (in the menu this is Penne pasta but we substituted with spaghetti and its very tasty), Insalata alla caprese, Tiramisu, and the Prosciuttto e rucola pizza (at the Beachwalk location this was really delicious but not at the Marriott).

 Atmosphere : The Beach Walk store is a very small, quaint restaurant and the tables are situated very close together. Not ideal location for an intimate dinner experience. The Marriott location has nice outdoor seating which is great for people watching in Waikele and has great shade for those hot Hawaii days.

 Consistency: Well between the two restaurants it wasn’t very consistent at all and the ingredients where definitely not the same quality. However, The pasta excellent good both times and was good enough to warrant a revisit.

 Parking : For the Beachwalk location is situated in the heart of Waikiki so parking is tough but you can always park at the Royal Hawaiian Center and walk a few blocks or Arancino validates the Bank of Hawaii parking structure on the weekdays for 2 hours and on the weekends its free to park all day! For the Marriott they have guest parking and validate for 3 hours so you can also enjoy the beach after a meal or walk through Waikiki after dinner. If you wish to valet the car it costs $10 without tip and with validation from Arancino.

 Tango 
 August 3rd, 2009 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is so so – it’s not really good, and it’s not really bad, it’s just slow…and you are at the mercy of your server. Often times they ignore you all together but its really hit or miss, we have also had very good service at Tango. Historically it has been much better for lunch than for dinner.

 Food : Food is fresh and well executed. The presentation and menu have a very strong Scandinavian flare and its something you won’t find at any other restaurant in Hawaii. Frequently they run out of dishes and in all the times we have gone they have never had the Rhubarb dessert that’s on the menu since they opened!

 Favorite Dishes: Salmon Salad, Gravlax Sandwich

 Atmosphere : Very small restaurant and crowded so be ready to sit close to your neighbor. The atmosphere is nice and airy and the restaurant has loft ceiling. Modern art complements the bright space. Very noisy when full.

 Consistency: You get what you where expecting every time. The dishes are also consistently good between one anther, so trying something different isn’t quite as much of a“risk”at a restaurant like this which is nice.

 Parking : It’s located at The Hokua condominium building next to P.F. Chang’s at Ward Center. Tango validates parking so be sure to remember your ticket stub.

 Hy’s Steakhouse 
 February 15th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service: The service is always excellent. The staff is friendly, attentive and professional. Your waiter is also very present through the experience as Hy’s has table service (i.e. they make the salads and desserts at your table fresh). 

 Food: Caesar Salad, New York Strip (medium), Baked Potato, Sauteed Spinach, Cherries Jubilee, and the House Merlot. 

 Atmosphere: The“Library”is beautiful, romantic and very classic in its architecture. The ceilings are very high and the booths are charming. You may end up seated in the top room which doesn’t really feel like Hy’s classy atmosphere but the food is still good. It’s recommended when making reservation to request“Library”seating . 

 Consistency: Always consistently delicious! being a personal chef in Hawaii I always appreciate and acknowledge consistency. When you go to many restaurants the food is different depending on who is in the kitchen and its having excellent consistency that  separates a good chefs and restaurants from bad ones.
 

 Parking: It’s located at at the Waikiki Park Heights hotel so you can valet your car.

 Michel’s at the Colony Surf 
 February 15th, 2010 
 Overall Review : 

 Service : The service is always excellent. The staff is attentive, professional and well dressed! You also see your waiter throughout the dinner as Michel’s is lucky enough to have table service (i.e. they make the salads, soups and desserts at your table fresh).

 Food : The food is delicious at Michel’s. The best part about eating at this elegant restaurant is that they have table side service which makes for a captivating and interesting evening. The food is extremely rich so its recommended to share a main dish or just eat a few appetizers for dinner.
 Michels Restaurant Menu For Download 

 Favorite Dishes: All these items are made at your table!–Hickory Smoked Salmon Appetizer, Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, and Cherries Jubilee. French onion soup is also wonderful!

 Atmosphere : Michels is hands down the most beautiful restaurant in Hawaii. The view is magnificent and super romantic. Its best to go as the sun sets and ask to sit closest to the water. That being said you won’t be disappointed with any table at the restaurant.

 Consistency: Historically we have had excellent food and only once in the last 4 years where we disappointed by a watery lobster bisque and over cooked steak. Every other time has been delicious and consistent.

 Parking : It’s located at at the Colony Surf so you may valet your car there or park at the Kapiolani Beach Park (near the fountain) and walk.

 Big City Diner 
 March 1st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is always very good at all the Big City Diners. The staff has a lot of Aloha and you always feel right at home.

 Food : The food is excellent. The menu screams classic American“diner”but with a local flare. There is something for everyone at the Big City Diner and its sure to become your families favorite! They also have an excellent Happy Hour Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm with your favorite dine-in pupus at 50% OFF and $1 OFF big beers, house wines and well drinks. Big City Diner also features a weekly menu selection of $10 entrees which are delicious, fresh and make the menu really exciting.

 Favorite Dishes: Ultimate Vegetable Omelet, Bloody Marys (designated as breakfast food), Fresh Fish&amp;Eggs, Fried Rice, Ramen, Salmon Salad, Paniolo Chicken Salad, Taco Salad, Upcountry Veggie Sandwich and many others!

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is nothing fancy but that’s part of the charm. Its a place where you can never be under dressed and is perfect for spending time and a quick bite with friends and family. Each location has the same homely environment and they even have a treasure chest and balloons for the keiki’s! yay!

 Consistency: Each location is excellent and we never leave disappointed.

 Parking : For the Kaimuki location the best place to park is at the Kaimuki shopping center. For the Ward Center location directly across from the movie theater is a good place to start looking for parking or in front of Nordstrom’s Rack. If you are in a rush you can valet on the second floor of the movie theater parking lot for $5.

 Price Range: Low ($8-$20) per Entree (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner)

 P.F. Chang’s 
 March 1st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is hit or miss at P.F. Chang’s. Typically its not that bad but every once and a while you can get less than acceptable waitstaff.

 Food : The food is pretty good. The menu is American Chinese and P.F. Chang’s has all the basic standards you would expect like Lemon Chicken and Mongolian Beef. Nothing really exciting but all the food is good. They have a special lunch menu which is a good deal and attractive if your going for a business engagement and are short on time. P.F. Chang’s also has a Happy Hour Monday-Friday from 3pm-7pm with half of appetizers and Drink specials–$3 draft beers, $6 Drinks, $2 OFF wine

 Favorite Dishes: Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Dumplings, Hot&amp;Sour Soup, Spicy Green Beans, Kung Pao Chicken, Buddha’s Feast, Cantonese Chow Fun, Marinated Sea Bass and Dirty Martini (they are so big they count as food!) 

 Atmosphere : Both locations have a similar landscape and are both very beautiful inside. The concept is fresh, contemporary and bright. Guests can be seated both outside and inside which is nice for breezy summer days or brisk winter nights. The high ceilings and art help make these restaurants dynamic.

 Consistency: Both Hawaii P.F. Chang’s are consistent.

 Parking : If you are going to the Waikiki location the best place to park is at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. If you are going to Ward Center the best place to park is at the Hokua condominium where the restaurant is located. P.F. Chang’s will validate parking at both these places.

 Price Range: Medium ($10-$25) per Entree
Corkage Fee: $10 (Cannot Bring Wines that are on P.F. Chang’s Wine List)

 Town 
 March 1st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is so so–that being said we have had much better service for dinner than for lunch.

 Food : The food is contemporary, fun and delicious! The trend is organic and island fresh with an Italian /Mediterranean twist. Town often changes the menu which keeps things entertaining. The entree dishes are not big enough for sharing but it is recommended to order few appetizers for the table to sample for fun if you are not exceptionally hungry. (TIP: If you go for lunch and are craving a salad be warned its the size of a small appetizer! you need to order the“Big”salad or stop at Tamura’s for some Poki on your way home!)

 Favorite Dishes: Ahi Cake, Arugula Salad, Fresh Fish, Hand Cut Pastas&amp;Gnocchi are quite good.

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is very hip and chic. You can sit both outside (dog friendly) or inside. The acoustics are not so great so if the restaurant is full be ready to yell to your friends to be heard. The restaurant is both casual and classy so you can dress up if you like or go as you are depending on your dinning engagement and company.

 Consistency: Dinner is consistently good but we have had a few painfully slow and not very good lunches.

 Parking : Town has a 30-car private parking lot in the back but you need to have“parkma”to get a spot as its also shared with another restaurant. You can also find ample free street parking is once the lot is full typically without problems.

 Roy’s 
 June 29th, 2011 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is top notch at Roy’s. From the moment you arrive till your exit from the restaurant you are treated as a prince / princess. The waiters are attentive, courteous, and extremely professional at this 5 start dinning establishment.

 Food : The food is modern asian pacific cuisine and items you can expect to find on the menu are Sushi, Salads, Seafood, Meats and of course desserts. The fresh fish is sensational and truly captivates the essence of the islands. The meats are also very tender and the short ribs just fall off the bone. There hasn’t been anything we have tried on the menu that we sent back or didn’t think was terrific. Another nice touch is instead of giving you a big basket of bread to start  you receive a bowl of well seasoned edamame which is a nice light start to your decadent meal.

 Favorite Dishes: Beef Carpaccio, Baby Back Ribs, Salads, Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (OMG delicious!!), Short Ribs (Fantastic!), Chocolate Soufflé, and Pineapple Upside Down Cake

 Atmosphere : The ambiance at Roy’s in Waikiki is stunning. Both the inside and outside seating area’s are and tropical feeling. The art is also asian influenced which ties into the dinning experience very well. The inside area is rather large but has good acoustics. The only negative thing the restaurant was freezing cold. The outside is much more casual feeling and also has a bar which is perfect for some pupu’s or drinks while enjoying Waikiki.The Hawaii Kai location is in Hawaii Kai and has a similar decor. The restaurant is located upstairs and is also lovely.

 Consistency: The consistency at Roy’s is fantastic. Each time you come you can be sure to have a delicious dish with the same amount of food, seasoning and taste as you remembered it.

 Parking : Roy’s has validated parking at the hotel around the corner on Beach Walk at the Embassy suites for $6 for 4 hours (you can forget about finding street parking! don’t even try…its not happening). At the Hawaii Kai flagship location you can park for free at that Hawaii Kai Towne Center.

 Wolfgang’s Steakhouse 
 March 21st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service was pretty good and the staff was both friendly and attentive. The only negative thing that happened was for Happy Hour when we first sat down our servers shift was ending and it took a while for our new server to take over (at least 20 min!) during which time they lost our initial order which was annoying. That being said, once the change over happened our server was on top of his game.

 Food : The food was really disappointing. When you go to a restaurant of this caliber you expect everything to be cooked to perfection but it was not. Throughout the meal we where constantly reminded that if you want a good steak go to Hy’s!
 Download Wolfgang’s Steakhouse Menu In Waikiki 

 Favorite Dishes: Happy Hour: Steak Tartar&amp;Ahi Tartar (both only $5) where the best dishes of the 4 they offer from 5:30-6:30pm. Dinner: Canadian Bacon! Yummy! it’s so good you can just go and eat that for dinner, Sauteed Spinach, Ribeye Steak, Apple Strudel (straight out of the Swiss Alps).

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere of the restaurant is elegant with dark floors, high ceilings and beautiful views of the Royal Hawaiian lanai area and Waikiki. The restaurant isn’t particularly large but they managed to squeezed a ton of tables into the space which makes uncomfortable and the acoustics are terrible. The floor was so incredibly slippery that it was like an ice skating rink, be careful and for god sake hold on!

 Consistency: Both times we have gone, the food has been terribly inconsistent and throughout the meal we have had a range of food i.e. Fries that where soggy than crispy, potato chips where stale then burned, sliders and steak which was raw and then totally overcooked.

 Parking : Wolfgang is located in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center so its best to park in the mall and make sure to get your ticket validated for free parking or it can cost you a small fortune to park!

 Pyramids 
 March 1st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is pretty good but the best part is the costumes they make the staff wear. They are both tacky and hilarious!!

 Food : If your itching for some Middle Eastern food Pyramids is your best bet on the Island. The menu is traditional with selections like Shawarmas, Moussaka, Hummus, Falafel, Baba Ganoush along with other Middle Eastern favorites. We recommend going for lunch where they have a $12 buffet as dinner can get a bit pricey. The buffet is enough food to eat like a king and you can try a little of everything! The only thing to keep in mind is that Pyramids does not provide belly dancing entertainment for lunch.

 Favorite Dishes: Spanakopita, Hummus, Lamb Kebabs, Chicken Shawarma and Chicken Salad.

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is about the best thing going for this restaurant. Its fun, well decorated, causal and for dinner they have live entertainment! The overall experience is very lively and if you are in the mood for something different you can’t beat the staff costumes and the middle eastern decor.

 Consistency: It’s consistently OK–would only go if wanted some free entertainment and was in the mood for some belly dancing!

 Parking : Street parking can be challenging as the restaurant is located on Kapahulu but they do have free parking behind Pyramids if you circle around the block. Make sure to let them know you parked in the designated lot when you are seated since there are no parking stubs to validate.

 Panya Bistro 
 March 18th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is not very good at Panya Bistro. More than once our server forgot our appetizer which was disappointing. It also appears they only have two servers working at a time making it almost impossible to get a refill on your drink, and even paying the check can become a chore!

 Food : The food is good. The menu is very interesting and borrows items from around the globe. You can a wide range of foods such as Vietnamese Summer Rolls, New England Clam Chowder, Spaghetti, Char Siu Ramen, or even Miso Soup and Curry! ( Tip: Panya is also a walk-in bakery with cakes, breads and wonderful pastries!)

 Favorite Dishes: Thai Style Rib Eye Steak Salad, Tofu Salad, Panya Burger, Homemade Gyoza, and Green Beans.

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is very trendy, small and chic. The decor is minimalistic and the bar has a beautiful recycled counter top and cool glass bottles illuminate on the wall. The restaurant is small and very popular so it can be hard to go with big groups.

 Consistency: Panya’s food is contestant and a good recommendation for a trendy lunch date with a friend.

 Parking : Panya has a great location right next to Longs in Ala Moana Shopping Center. Parking is free anywhere in the mall and typically you can find parking on the second floor (close to Sears&amp;Longs) and walking to the Bistro/Bakery.

 Taco Ricos 
 March 18th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The staff was really nice but the restaurant didn’t have a bathroom, bottle opener, or any sour cream. Also they ran out of fish tacos and they never offered us any water during our short meal there. The second time we went they did have the fish but it was precooked and cold. The staff was also pretty slow so don’t go here if you are in a rush!

 Food : The food is simple and what you would expect from a traditional street Mexican vendor. The tacos are small, round, and wrapped in double corn tortillas. The restaurant has a great condiment bar with interesting toppings and home made salsa. The meat tacos where dry and old tasting (you can get a variety plate of 5 tacos for $9) but the fish was delicious and made the trip worth while. That being said…last time we went the fish tacos where to wet and not so good for the price.

 Favorite Dishes: Fish Tacos (it’s fresh catfish!), (from the condiment bar–Salsa Verde, Pickled Red Onion, Cilantro)

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is overall pretty ghetto. The inside is very minimalistic and a really cool exterior paint job. The music is custom mixed for the shop and really adds to the authentic Mexican experience. Taco Ricos is definitely the kind of place you could wear anything to or be as drunk as you want without consequence. The restaurant only has 2 tables and some bar seating so its more of a eat and run type of establishment.

 Consistency: Taco Ricos is not very consistent. Its really hit or miss but the last two times have been big misses so we don’t recommend this restaurant very highly.

 Parking : Taco Ricos is on Kapahulu street so the best place to park is on the street which is metered.

 Price Range: Low ($5-$12) per Entree
No Corkage Fee!
(TIP: They don’t have a wine opener so drink beer or bring a screw top wine)

 Himalayan Kitchen 
 March 20th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : We where served in a timely manner but the staff was not very helpful or particularly friendly. We asked our waitress and water boy’s opinion on dishes, one didn’t answer and the other recommended something that was oily and basically inedible!

 Food : The food was not very good. It was ok but most likely because they used MSG in the food. We had to mix the curry, rice and bread all together to make anything taste good at all.

 Favorite Dishes: Papadan, Chicken Curry, and Jalapeno&amp;Garlic Nan.

 Atmosphere : A cool artsy restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. The ambiance is bright, homely and has a ethnic feel to it. The restaurant has beautiful artwork from the Himalayas which really adds something special to the decor and is very inviting.

 Consistency: We have only been once so far but the food was consistently boring throughout the meal.

 Parking : The Himalayan Kitchen is located in the Kaimuki shopping center which is has a good amount of spots. The restaurant does not validate parking but its not expensive at all to park there so no worries.

 Price Range: Medium ($10-$18) per Entree
No Corkage Fee!

 Kaka’ako Kitchen 
 March 24th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is excellent at Kaka’ako Kitchen. They have a very low employee turnover rate and all the staff goes above and beyond their job descriptions to provide provide excellent and personable service.

 Food : The food is really good at Kaka’ako Kitchen. It’s a favorite spot of locals and they serve great plate lunches which are always fresh and hit the spot every time! You can also order your plate with either fresh Nalo greens, crispy fries, or macaroni salad depending on what your in the mood for and what fits into your dieting.

 Favorite Dishes: Fried Rice (only served at breakfast), Furikake Mahi Wrap, Seared Ahi Chop Salad, Furikake Tempura Catfish (extra delicious!), Sweet Chili Chicken, and Fresh Catch of the Day. (TIP: The salad dressing is to-die-for and you can also purchase a bottle for $7 to take home)

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is one where you order at the counter, pay, take a number and then they bring your plate to where you select to sit. There are both outdoor (covered) and indoor seating available and its a great place to go for a quick bite. The atmosphere is laid back and it’s the perfect place to people watch.

 Consistency: The food is consistently excellent and exactly what you expect it to be every time! We have never been disappointed with the food.

 Parking : The good news is parking is free at Ward Center. The bad news is you have to fight for your spot! It’s recommended to park in the lot across from the movie theater and walk across the street or tackle the parking structure.

 Mermaid Bar 
 March 26th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service can be slow at Mermaid Bar but the staff is really friendly and as long as you are not in a rush its a great option for lunch.

 Food : The food is Contemporary and seasonally inspired. The menu selection is simple with soups, salads and sandwiches but the Mermaid bar offers unique twist on the classics making it dynamic. Also the desserts are made fresh daily and irresistibly good if you are in the mood for a afternoon coffee and pastry to share with friends.

 Favorite Dishes : Custom–Build Your Own Salad, NM Sampler, Turkey Chili and the Spa Wrap. ( TIP : Oxtail Soup is the special every Thursday and is delicious but they always sell out so go no later than 12pm or be prepared to order something else!)

 Atmosphere : Mermaid Bar is a contemporary, small, bright and airy restaurant. It’s the perfect place to go for lunch while your out shopping. The restaurant is very casual and has excellent day light. The art is also very unique and trendy.

 Consistency: The restaurant has consistent good food. Often times the salad size varies along with the number of toppings but the food is fresh, good and what you are expecting every time.

 Parking : The restaurant is located at Ala Moana Shopping Center in Neiman Marcus so you can park for free anywhere at the mall. Neiman Marcus also offers valet parking.

 Apartm3nt 
 March 29th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service was exceptional at Apartment 3. Even when the night crowd started to filter in our waitress was on top of her game. As she bobbed and weaved through people she never forgetting our orders or missing a beat. The bartenders are also top notch and mix up some delicious drinks.

 Food : Apartment3 has a very interesting menu and takes modern play on traditional comfort foods such as Ratatouille, Mac&amp;Cheese and French Onion Soup and integrates locally and sustainably ingredients to make dynamic and bold dishes. Happy Hour is one of the best in town with $5 specialty drinks, $4 drafts, and $5 pizzas to name a few. ( TIP : Tuesday night is Happy Hour All Night!)

 Favorite Dishes: Beet Salad (amazing!), The Yard Sale, Cheese&amp;Honey, Stacked Ratatouille, and The Parma thin Crusted Pizza. ( TIP : All the appetizers are large enough to share and only $5 each for happy hour–making it one of the best deals in town!)

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is very cozy, classy and inviting. The room is very dark, lounge like and features a fireplace in the bar area. Apartment 3 also has pool tables and a special room for private parties. The main dinning room is off to the side of the bar and not quite as exciting as the lounge but has nice booth seating if your looking for a more intimate dinning experience. It’s not a very casual place so if you want to fit in you should dress to impress anytime after 8pm.

 Consistency: The food and experience has been consistently strong since they opened. It continues to be one of our favorite places to go meet people after work as they have such a great happy hour, good music and friendly staff.

 Parking : Apartment3 is located at the Century Center which has about 20 guest stalls which you can park in. The restaurant/bar also validates so the parking is free which makes this a very convenient place to go

 BLT 
 March 29th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service was top notch at BLT. They have plenty of staff and I never had an empty glass of water throughout dinner. The waiter was extremely nice and also very helpful in answering questions we had about what was in each dish.

 Food : The menu at BLT is classic Steakhouse meets French bistro. They have a very diverse menu and wonderful raw seafood selections. BLT spoils you with two table appetizers starting with grilled bread and warm pate, followed by hot popovers covered with cheese. They have everything you would expect on a traditional Steakhouse menu in addition to a Chefs Daily Special 3 course menu which everyone at our table took advantage of for only $60 per a person! The dishes where inspiring, had very generous portions and an island pacific flare to it.

 Favorite Dishes: The free appetizers of course! From our 3 course dinners–Spicy King Crab Dumplings in Miso Soup, Tenderloin, Crusted Shutome, and Coconut Parfait with Guava Curd and Pineapple Soup was the most delicious dessert we have had in a while.

 Atmosphere : BLT has a wonderful atmosphere. The restaurant has both with indoor and outdoor seating perfect for any occasion. The ambiance is beautiful with walnut floors, dark leather banquettes and highlighted with tropical art and murals. The restaurants design has fantastic flow from room to room and even the bar area is separated enough from the main restaurant that it creates another interesting dinning experience and really helps reduce the traffic and noise to the dining room.

 Consistency: We have only been once so far but promise to update this section when we go again which will be soon since it was so delicious!

 Parking : BLT is located in Waikiki so parking is challenging on the street and Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center is a bit of a walk. We recommend valeting your car as the restaurant validates and you can even enjoy a free bottled water while waiting for your car after dinner (or after dinner drinks upstairs).

 Olive Tree Cafe 
 June 7th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The Olive Tree is a seat yourself restaurant and  the service is fantastic. The service providers are friendly, pleasant and very quick to take your order and clear tables. A great idea if you are concerned about waiting for a table is to call in advance for take-out. You can typically pick up your order 15 min after ordering, walk straight to the front of the line and be home before a table opens up!

 Food : The Food at the Olive Tree is traditional Greek. It’s fresh, flavorful and always delicious.  It’s hands down the best Greek food in Hawaii and a fun affordable place to go with friends, family and even a date.

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Fish Slovaki (TIP: If you are trying to not eat bread order this dish without the pita and ask for extra salad!), Lamb Slovaki, The Daily Special, Hummus, Babaganoush, Olives and Feta Cheese, and the Dolmas.

 Atmosphere : The Olive Tree has a wonderful, hip ambiance to it. It is a seat yourself restaurant and you can select a table out doors or in doors depending on availability and the weather. The restaurant plays authentic Greek music to add to the experience. It is extremely busy so its recommended to have one person hunt for a table while the rest order inside or you could wait forever.

 Consistency: The restaurant is very consistent and you always get what you are expecting. Being a private chef in Honolulu I have first hand experience what restaurants retain the integrity of their dishes time and time again.  Over the past years we cannot think of one instance where we had bad food at Olive Tree Cafe!

 Parking : The Olive Tree has free parking if for about 10 cars. The parking is directly in front of the restaurant but also shares with Subway. If you are not lucky enough to find a spot you can park on the street outside of the Kahala post office.

 Pineapple Room 
 April 15th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is the only thing really lacking at this restaurant. Typically the staff is very helpful and friendly however, super slow to take your order and follow up with drink refills and other requests (i.e.  by the time  extra ketchup arrived at the table we had already devoured the fries!). The bar has much better service and if your aiming for more of a eat&amp;shop experience that’s where you should sit.

 Food : The food is delicious at Alan Wong’s Pineapple Room! The food is inspired by fresh local grown ingredients and diverse cultures in Hawaii. The food is fresh and definitely speaks to Pacific&amp;Hawaii Regional Cuisine.

 Favorite Dishes: Garlic Stir-fried Soy Beans, Steamed“Chinese Style”Onaga, Any Fresh Fish Dish,“Pineapple Room”Ceaser Salad (like a chopped salad with Kailua Pork), Seared Ahi Steak&amp;Tofu Salad (TIP: ask for two pieces of Tofu instead of the Ahi Steak its the star of the dish), Kailua Pig“BLT”, Hamburger with French Fries (ask for them extra crispy), and the Chocolate Crunch Bar. 
 

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere of the pineapple room is light, tropical and elegant. They do an excellent job of including  Hawaiian textures and prints into the featured artwork as well as the furniture/kitchen. The restaurant has wonderful windows that give nice day light to the dinning area. You can also sit at the bar if you like which is faster and and also very pleasant but not quite as Hawaiian in its feel.

 Consistency: The pineapple rooms food is consistently good and the service is consistently slow!

 Parking : One of the many advantages of going to this restaurant is its located in Macy’s at Ala Moana Shopping Center. To avoid the parking frenzy that can occur at this shopping hub we recommend going directly to the third floor of the garage and park as close to Macy’s as you can. Parking is free anywhere in the mall and the roof is usually pretty open (TIP: If you are a shade junky beware the third floor is not covered!)

 The Counter 
 June 1st, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service The Counter is very good while seated at the counter, however seating in the main restaurant can prove challenging. They only have one or two waitresses and they struggle to keep up with the drinks and orders which gets old real fast. 
 

 Food : The food is pretty good at The Counter. When you go, you go for only two things, Hamburgers and French Fries.  Each eater is given a check list to“create”there burger in a bowl or on a bun upon arrival and they have endless toppings to choose from including a special topping of the month to tantalize its customers. We recommend ordering some fries for the table to share they are not only  delicious  but come out fast (TIP: If you seat at a table these table treats could keep you from eating the silverware or getting the grumpy) 

 Favorite Dishes: Turkey Burger–In a Bowl–Mixed Greens–Red Onion–Jalapenos–Blue Cheese–Cranberries–Avocado, Hamburger–On a Bun–Mixed Greens, Tomato, Grilled Onion, Jalapeno Jack Cheese, Roasted Garlic Aioli (on the side), The“Fifty-Fifty”Sweet Potato Fries&amp;Regular Fries 
 

 Atmosphere : The Counter has a great atmosphere and the concept of the restaurant is to build your ultimate personal burger in a trendy diner. The layout is clean, bright and feels a bit industrial. The music is fresh and they often play sports at the bar making it a great place for a quick bite or after-work drink.

 Consistency: When The Counter first opened we felt the food was better cooked and the service was faster. As time as moved on its gotten a little more generic and not as good as it used to be, however, if you are in the mood for a burger I can’t think of anywhere else better to go.

 Parking : The Counter is located at the Kahala Shopping Center right next to Whole Foods. It’s easiest to park on the second floor of the parking garage then walk down the stairs to the restaurant.

 Kaimana Beach Hotel–Hau Tree Resturant 
 April 30th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service was so so at the Kaimana Beach Hotel. The staff is def union and we had some old timers serving us. They where all very friendly, local and personable, however, they where not very fast or gave good recommendations. That being said they did refund our crappy appetizer which we appreciated.

 Food : The food is ok. The fresh fish was good and brought the overall dining experience up.  The vegetables where cooked perfectly and the portion size was way above average and I would defiantly go back for the dish.

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Opakapaka with steamed vegetables ( TIP : Do not order the Chefs Ocean Trio! gross)

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is prob the best thing going for this restaurant. Yes the furniture is VERY dated–think 60′s–bright pink table clothes that are super run down and rinky-dink tables and chairs. However, the restaurant sites ocean front and is shaded by a beautiful Hau Tree where Robert Louis Stevenson use to sit and write. At one time this restaurant was most likely IN and charming but now it looks like it needs a serious make over! If you visit either look up at the tree or out over the ocean and no where else!

 Consistency: We have only been once for dinner so far but once we return promise to update this portion.

 Parking : The restaurant is located at the Kaimana Beach Hotel so you can valet the car and get validation. Or you can park at Kaimana Beach park and walk.

 California Pizza Kitchen 
 July 20th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service at CPK is excellent. They are very attentive, make great recommendations and always make you feel at home. If you are in a rush its recommended to grab a seat at the bar, its fast and you won’t have to wait to be seated! 
 

 Food : The food at CPK is always perfect. The food is Californian-Italian-American and has a very good selection of salads, pizza and pasta with international inspiration. They are constantly adding new food to the menu and offer fresh seasonal specials. It’s the type of restaurant where everyone leaves happy and is a good place to go with family or friends!

 Favorite Dishes: Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Field Green Salad, Waldorf Chicken Salad, Tricoloré Salad Pizza, Thai Chicken Pizza, Thin Crust Pizzas!

 Atmosphere : The ambiance at all CPK’s are very contemporary. The ceilings are high and the color scheme is black and yellow. The restaurants are casual and you can feel comfortable wearing anything to one of there establishments. The bars are also very nice and the seats are comfortable.

 Consistency: This is one of the most consistent restaurants we have been to. All the ingredients are weighted out and you always get exactly the same size and taste every time you go.

 Parking : Depending on which location you visit parking is usually always available. The Kahala and Ala Moana Mall locations have ample parking and for the Waikiki location its best to park at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center parking across the street.

 Du Vin 
 July 25th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The overall service is so so at Du Vin. The staff is very friendly but not fast by any means and historically we have had better service for dinner than lunch.

 Food : The food is pretty good. It’s Italian french inspired and they use a lot of yummy ingredients such as Arugula, Prosciutto,  Assorted Meats, Cheese and Fresh Fish so its hard to go wrong. For lunch and dinner they always have great specials and a Prix Fixe menu for only $25 a person. The deal comes complete with the daily appetizer, entree and dessert. (FYI: Du Vin doesnt allow any substitutes on these items)

 Favorite Dishes: Moules frites, Escargot, Roasted Beet Salad, Crostini of warm Gorgonzola Dolce and Prosciutto, Pork Chop, Fresh Fish of the day

 Atmosphere : Du Vin is absolutely one of the most wonderful restaurants in all of Hawaii when it comes to its Atmosphere. The restaurant screams Italy or Spain with its series of small connecting rooms all with intimate lighting and indoor/outdoor seating options. The Salon is the place you want to sit after work with your mates and have a glass of wine, cheese selection, and unwind. The Patio is the romantic place to sit with a date or close friend under the stars. The Cask Room you may find yourself in for a wine tasting or a family reunion. This room can be rented out for large functions and has a beautiful old bar at its center.

 Consistency: The restaurant is pretty consistent. Sometimes the bread is a bit old but they heat it up which helps it taste fresher. On first Friday Du Vin gets extremely busy so for better food and better service come sometime during the week.

 Parking : Du Vin is located in the heart of Honolulu so there are numerous public parking garages or if you have parkma (parking karma) that day you may snag a street spot. If not its recommend parking at the China Town lot of Beretania and walking to the restaurant but remember to check because some lots close up after 12am!

 Sushi Izakaya Gaku 
 December 12th, 2010 
 Overall Review : 

 Service : The service as Gaku is exceptional. The staff is not only helpful but extremely professional. Each time we go to Gaku we are welcomed into the restaurant with smiling faces and the type of service which you hope to receive every time you go out.

 Food : The food is absolutely Delicious! they have a wide assortment of Japanese treasures including sushi, hot appetizers, tempura, and many other classic meat and seafood dishes. The specials are always excellent so ask your waiter whats fresh–each waiter tries all the specials on the menu daily and are well versed on each dish.

 Favorite Dishes: Tuna Baked King Crab (OMG soooo delicious), Onyasai vegetables, Hamachi Tartar, and Cold Glass of Sake

 Atmosphere : Gaku has a wonderful ambiance. It’s a small restaurant, with intimate lighting. You feel like you are in Japan, a magical place where anything could happen. The only down side is that this intimate restaurant only has about 10 tables and it is very popular so you will have to wait to get a seat almost any day of the week. They do take reservations before 7pm each night but you still need to call a few days in advance.  Also something to note is that half of the tables are ground seating which is fun but not so good if you have a bad back (Tip: when you make a reservation request one of the 3 tables in the front room.)

 Consistency: Each time we go to Gaku we are left full and happy. The food is excellent and always consistent. Only one or two times has a dish varied in flavor.

 Parking : Parking is free at Gaku, however, there are only a few stalls in the back (about 10). When your driving to Gaku for the first time be on the look out for the restaurant on the right hand side of the street because if you miss it you have to backtrack around the block because king street is one-way. The parking is located directly after the door to the restaurant. If the lot is full you can park on the  street and walk after rush hour.

 The Fat Greek 
 August 8th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The Fat Greek is a plate lunch type of establishment so there is no table staff and you need to order from the counter, take a number, and wait for your order to be called. The staff is friendly and responsive to guests needs for example when a friends order came out with a big black hair on top they took it back and made him a new one without a hesitation. Sometimes they can be slow and food does tend to trickle out randomly.

 Food : The food at The Fat Greek is typical Greek with a Mediterranean twist. The food in general is pretty healthy as most dishes contain lean protein, fresh vegetables, lemon and olive oil rather than fried foods. The Fat Greek has the typical Greek / Mediterranean dishes you would be“craving”such as Falaffel, Shwarmas, Souvlaki, Gyros, Greek Salads, Lamb, Hummus, and great pita bread.

 Favorite Dishes: Greek Salad, Spanokopita, Soulvaki (Don’t get the fish its not as good as the meat), Daily Special (always great specially the fresh salmon or Moussaka), Greek Fries  (TIP: for the love of god DO NOT order the chicken soup it’s terrible!)

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at The Fat Greek is that of a querky yet quaint local dive. It has an odd charm to it and has great outdoor seating but is not exactly fancy or even trendy. The place is pretty clean and they have plenty of seating so its a good place to go with kids or friends for a quick bite, but certainly not recommended for a lengthily meal or an intimate first date.

 Consistency: We have only been twice but both times have been consistently OK . It’s not like anything you eat knocks your socks off or anything but its not bad and if you are in the mood for Greek and not close to Kahala (so you can eat at the Olive Tree Cafe)  this is a good dinning option.

 Parking : The Fat Greek does have some parking available but not that many stalls and they are shared with other neighboring restaurants like Sabrina’s, Aloha with Spice, and Cafe Tajmahal so you need to be lucky or very patient to get a spot. You can also park across the street in the out door parking lot but its a flat rate of $5 and last time we parked there and paid we STILL got a ticket! those old machines are unreliable and rather expensive for being located on Waialae.

 Side Street Inn 
 July 29th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is wonderful at the new Side Street Inn on Da Strip! from the moment the valet opened the car door, to the moment we were seated the service was excellent. The staff was smiling, happy, and down right pleasant through the entire meal. Its rare to find such good service and it commendable!

 Food : The food is served family style so its the perfect place to go with lots of friends&amp;family for pupus or dinner. The menu is very typical of a local style restaurant with lots of Asian and Island flavors, lots of meat dishes, appetizers and overall good grindz.  Each dish was served hot, fresh and in a timely manner so its no wonder the place was packed!

 Favorite Dishes: Nalo Green Salad (big and delicious), Pork Chops, Hoisin BBQ Baby Back Ribs (all ribs are just delicious!), Garlic Soy Beans, and drum roll….Peanut Butter Crunch dessert. Sooooo freaken good!  (Tip: Don’t order the fried rice, its very heavy and not very crispy)

 Atmosphere : The new side street in has a great atmosphere. The restaurant has ample seating and airy high ceilings prefect for absorbing all the noise. The Side Street in has both booth and table seating making it a very homey, bright and modern restaurant you can feel comfortable wearing anything in.

 Consistency: We have only been to this new location once but the food is consistently tasty with the other Side Street Inn location on 1225 Hopaka St.

 Parking : Oh the parking…yes not our favorite part of the evening seeing as the only convenient place to park is the valet service provided by the restaurant at a $5 fee without tip! Don’t get me wrong…I’ll pay for valet but if I eat at the restaurant I hope to get a better deal than $7-$8 per a visit. Of course you can always find free street parking on Kapahulu if your lucky.

 The Yard House 
 August 12th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is excellent at the Yard House despite how extremely busy it is. Regardless if you sit at the bar or a table the staff is attentive, friendly, and don’t leave you hanging for more drinks or whatever condiments you may need. The service does tend to be better earlier in the day/night and after it gets past 10pm it can be more challenging to flag down some staff if you are in the external bar seating. Our recommendation is to come early and once you are finished with dinner or pupu’s then migrate to the bar for more fun and faster drink service. Also…be ready to wait for your table. The Yard House is always busy and be prepared to wait for at least 45 min for a table during peak eating hours.

 Food : The food at The Yard House is pretty good. It’s nothing fancy but each dish is tasty and fresh. It’s prefect American style food to share with friends any time of the day and they also have a great happy hour late night and after work for drinks (Domestic Beer $3.50, Martini $6.25, Wine $1,50 off per glass) and half off appetizers and pizza. They also have a gluten sensitive menu for those with this growing food allergy.

 Favorite Dishes: Chicken Lettuce Wraps (da best!!–also good in vegetarian version), Moo Shu Egg Roll,  California Roll,  Spinach Cheese Dip (but don’t order that if you are on a diet its packed with tons of calories but is delicious specially after a few drinks), New York Steak Salad, Pizza’s, Burgers and Seared Ahi Steak Sandwhich

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at the Yard House is that of a fast-pass restaurant / bar. The decor is reminiscent of a trendy rock sports bar with tons of important beers, wide screen TV’s, double sided bar, and of course table seating. You always need to fight for a seat whether squeezing in at the bar or waiting the estimated 45-1.5 hours for your table. The music is always good at the Yard House if you like rock and your sure to have a good time with friends any time you meet at this hip venue.

 Consistency: The Yard House is consistently good. The food and service are pretty standard and you know what to expect each time you visit.

 Parking : Is pretty tricky at The Yard house for sure–there isn’t  street parking on Lewers but you can park at the valet at Embassy Suites Hotel on Beach Walk (NOTE  It costs $6 with validation not including tip!). Our recommendation is to take a cab and this way you can enjoy a few drinks, and not worry about parking in the heart of Waikiki!

 Keo’s 
 August 1st, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is ok–sometimes better than others. The staff is friendly and they fill the water up quickly so that’s always good! They also put the wine in a big ice bucket so it stays perfectly chilled during your dinning experience which is always lovely.

 Food : The food is pretty run of the mill Thai. Nothing on the menu is so good that it haunts me at night but its pretty tasty and when we go to Keo’s with friends the plates go back to the kitchen empty.

 Favorite Dishes: Thai Vegetarian Spring Rolls, Green Papaya Salad, Fish Patties, Basil Chicken, Green Curry, and the Pinot Gris 

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere makes this restaurant and brings the entire experience up. The entrance and inside of Keo’s is enchanting with orchids and Thai wood carvings surrounding the seats. The decor is tropical with a artsy flare. The only really strange part of the decor is the owner loves these large metal statues and they are everywhere inside the restaurant and extremely out of place since they are not Thai at all  (mostly statues of animals and women) but it does add a unique element to this particular Waikiki classic.

 Consistency: Keo’s is actually not very consistent. It really depends on who is cooking that day and each dish can literally come out tasting and looking different from visit to to visit. Basically one thing has remained the same that over the last 10 years the food has gone from great to just about average.

 Parking : Every time we have been to Keo’s in the past they had free valet parking, but this last time they allowed guests to park in their lot themselves which was very convenient.  The parking lot is just down the street making this a great place to meet&amp;eat in Waikiki if you are visiting out-of-towners.

 Price Range: Medium ($11-$20) per Entree 
Corkage Fee $20 per bottle of white and (seriously) they said $22 for Cabernet!! haha so the owner must not like red wine very much.

 Phuket Thai 
 December 29th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is friendly at Phuket Thai but also very lazy as every single glass we say in the establishment was dirty. In fact, the wine glass they brought me even had old (or new) lip stick on it! its pretty disgusting and specially when the restaurant isn’t busy the staff should have enough pride in the establishment to whip the water-marks or what-not off the glasses.

 Food : The food is not very good at Phuket Thai. It’s rather old tasting, very run of the mill stuff. Sometimes its above average and some times its not. I’ll put it this way….we wouldn’t recommend it to friends, or go again if we can help it, but if a group wants to go then recommend the Phuket Thai in McKully Shopping Center its much better than the new location at Ward.

 Favorite Dishes: Fish patties, spring rolls, curry. Don’t order the laab or basil chicken–NO GO–also papaya salad was pretty sad.

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere in Phuket Thai’s are pretty nice. You feel like your in a more upscale Thai restaurant and not a hole-in-the-wall. The ambiance is ambient, with pretty artwork and green/dark furniture and color pallet. During the day its more casual than at night and a place where families bring kids and eat a relaxing lunch. The new Ward area Location (with the worst food) is nicer than the Mccully location and has ample more tables.

 Consistency: These restaurants are consistently average. Sometimes they are pretty darn good…. or at least decent…. but this last time we went it was just terrible and everything was old tasting.

 Parking : The parking is just perfect at both Honolulu locations. The Mccully shopping center has free parking both in front of the restaurant (limited) as well as under the center (better parking). The Kamakee location has a parking lot right next to the restaurant which you need to pay $1 and get a ticket but then like validating a parking ticket Phuket Thai gives you a token to redeem your fee.

 Giovanni Pastrami 
 April 12th, 2011 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is good at Giovanni Pastrami in Waikiki. The bar has very friendly and attentive bartenders/waitstaff are full of smiles and very attentive to your needs. They can also mix up a mean cocktail!

 Food : Giovanni Pastrami’s menu consists of hot and cold deli sandwiches which are delicious, pizzas, appetizers, pastas, soups, salads, burgers, hot dogs and typical bar food. Another great appeal is that they server breakfast all day until closing at midnight which is always a winner if you are itching for some eggs and bacon. The food is ok for bar food and a perk is that they have a fantastic Happy Hour with free cheese pizza with any alcohol purchase between 3-5pm, $5 appetizers and deals on drinks ($3-4 beers, $4 well drinks, $1 off wine).

 Favorite Dishes: Reuben Bites (with pastrami), Sliders, Fries, Rueben Sandwich (with corn beef!) and Pizza

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is that of a sports bar. They have both table seating and bar seating but both are completely surrounded by flat screen TV’s on all the walls which are really distracting if you are trying to eat but perfect for this type of establishment where everyone has their eyes peeled to a sports game of some sort.

 Consistency: Giovanni is consistently average. It’s the type of place you go to for a happy hour drink or to valet your car and grab a quick validation to go somewhere else for dinner in Waikiki. Its absolutely consistently great for a drink!

 Parking : One of the very best things about Giovanni Pastrami is that they have valet parking at the Wyndham hotel right next to the bar. After 6pm its $6 to park for 4 hours but after that jumps up to $3 per a half hour so be careful or you can quickly run up a huge bill. Before 6pm you can park for $3 for a flat rate all day. .

 Formaggio’s Wine Bar 
 August 22nd, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service was good at Formaggio’s and they had plenty of staff on hand. The waiters however, where not very good listeners and they brought us the wrong pizza not once, but twice during our dinner! Also on a previous time they brought us the wrong wine which was double the cost of the bottle we had asked for.

 Food : The food is pretty darn tasty. They have good size portions for sharing with the table and the food is Italian-American-French. Typical items you can find on the menu are Pizzas, Salads, Panini’s, Fondue, Lobster bisque, Escargot, Foie Gras Crostini’s, Onion Soup and other good food to eat along with wine. The restaurant has over 50 wines by the glass and its fun to sample a few instead of committing to a full bottle. (TIP: double, triple check the wine you order. On more than one occasion they brought us the wrong bottle or the price was misleading on the menu!)

 Favorite Dishes: Salmon Carpaccio (yum!) , Boneless Short Ribs in Red Wine (falls right off the bone!), Mixed Green Salad, Cheese Sample Plat, Pancetta&amp;Pesto Pizza.

 Atmosphere : Love the atmosphere at Fomaggio’s. It’s very cozy with intimate lighting, low ceilings, and the flicker of candle light on each persons table. The restaurant feels like a wine cellar or somewhere exclusive and is small in size. You could dress up, or dress down for Formaggio’s depending on who you are going with.

 Consistency: Both times we have been to the Honolulu location have been pretty consistent. The bill was wrong on both occasions also but the wine and food where better than average and the overall experience was positive.

 Parking : Formaggio’s has free parking which is extremely convenient and directly in front of the restaurant. They have plenty of spaces and the easy accessibility from all the highway, Kapiolani blvd, and Kapahulu makes this a great place to meet friends after work.

 Price Range: Low-Medium ($8-$22) per Entree

 Imanas 
 August 28th, 2010 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The staff is so nice at Imanas. As soon as you walk through the front door you are greeted and ushered in. They have exceptional service and really make you feel special when you eat there by constantly bowing and smiling.

 Food : The food is super good at Imanas. They have almost everything you could ever want from a Japanese restaurant including Shabushabu, Sushi, Sashimi, Grilled and Fried dishes. What they don’t have is a tempura selection or individual meal box selections like many other Japanese restaurants do just an FYI before you plan a visit.  The food is light, refreshing and very moderately priced. We recommend ordering many different dishes and sharing so you can try different items and flavors. (TIP: Order a cold glass of Otakayama Sake, It is sooooo good and makes the food and evening all that much better!)

 Favorite Dishes: Thinly Sliced Founder, Spicy Tuna Roll, Avacado&amp;Salmon Roll, Spider Roll (OMG delicious!), Fried Gobo and Seafood, Butter Fish, Seasoned Burdock, Assorted Oshinko,  Fried Tofu with Miso Sauce (TIP: if you like it HOT get this dish its served with hot muster that really pack’s a punch!) and the Beef Shabushabu is also very good but has a minimum of two orders

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is absolutely stunning! the tables are beautiful and the entire ambiance is very zen from the second you walk into Imanas. The warm wood colors make you feel welcome and safe almost as if you where at home or a close friends for dinner. The natural elements create dynamic shadows on the floor and walls making the atmosphere absolutely lovely! This is a perfect restaurant for both an intimate date, or family gathering. The sushi bar is also fun to sit at if you are only 2 people and the seats are exceptionally comfortable (or that could be the sake talking).

 Consistency: Imanas is wonderfully consistent. we have been going for years and have never been disappointed by any dish we have eaten making this a first class Japanese restaurant to try.

 Parking : The restaurant does have a small 10-12 stall parking lot directly in front of it which has free parking but it is extremely hard to find a spot there–specially during key dinner time 6:30-7:30. However, there is also an extremely convenient paid parking lot to the left of the restaurant which is only about $1 per hour (they do not accept validation).

 Price Range: Medium ($5-$20) per Entree  (Sushi $3-$9.50 per roll)

 Mariposa 
 November 14th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service is very professional at Mariposa. The staff is very well trained they hire excellent  servers for the most part. They give you just enough attention that you feel taken care of but not rushed. You absolutely must have a reservation during rush lunch hour (12-1pm)  if you don’t want to wait for a table for ages.

 Food : The food is oh so good at Mariposas! everything and anything you order is cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is so good you can sway from your favorite dish to try something new and exciting without fear of a lousy meal. The menu consists of American and Asian-Pacific classics like Salads, Sandwiches, Pasta, Fresh Fish and other seasonal delights. Also Mariposas treats each diner to a little sip of turkey consomme followed by a huge flaky and delicious popover to hold you over before your appetizers / entree make their debut. Our advice is go for lunch!

 Favorite Dishes: Ahi Nicoise Salad, Applewood Salmon Salad, Mariposa Burger, Pasta’s, All-Specials, and Seared Diver Scallops.

 Atmosphere : I just love the ambiance at Mariposa’s and Nieman Marcus in general. The restaurant is located on the third floor and has a beautiful view of Ala Moana beach park and ocean. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating which is nice for versatility. The restaurant is large and in-charge with tropical vibrant art and beautiful ceiling fans. The moment you walk into Mariposa you feel like you are in a luxurious and tropical hot spot of food and culture. I find lunch a nicer overall experience than dinner–the day light and the lunch crowd are more casual and its an overall more pleasant experience than dinner.

 Consistency: We don’t treat ourselves as much as we would like but whenever we do visit Mariposa’s the food is consistently good. In fact, I frequent this restaurant with my other private chef friends which tells you its a winner for sure!

 Parking : Parking is as easy as pie since Mariposa is located at the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Nieman Marcus. Literally you can enter the mall from any entrance point and find ample   parking somewhere–best news it’s free! Another option if you are looking to impress someone or late for a date you can use the valet service offered at Nieman Marcus.

 Kincaid’s 
 September 5th, 2010 
 Overall : 

 Service : The service was excellent at Kincaid’s. Our waiter was professional, courteous and very helpful throughout our entire dinning experience. He was well spoken and we felt taken care of the moment we sat down. In fact, he went above and beyond to give us the fresh baked bread coming out of the oven and one of the dishes we ordered was fishy and our server took it back right away, apologized profusely and offered to replace it and give us free dessert. That’s exactly the type of service  you want to have at a restaurant! attentive and trustworthy (like I wasn’t worried he would spit in our food in the back).

 Food : The food is seafood&amp;steak through and through. The menu also has the classics like Fish Tacos, Salads, Calamari, Artichoke and Crab Dip, Oysters, Steaks, Pork Chops, Fresh fish and a bunch of daily specials. They often add and change the menu which keeps it interesting. Kincaid’s also has a good Kama’aina special a 3-course meal for only $25 between 4-6pm daily. They also host happy hour between 3pm-7pm&amp;10pm-close daily.
 Download Kincaid’s Menu in Honolulu 

 Favorite Dishes: Steamed Manila Clams (Delicious and not fishy at all!), French Fries, Mediterranean Salmon (on lunch specials menu), Home Grown Baby Greens with Maytag Blue Cheese Spring Rolls (ask for light on the dressing but very interesting and tasty dish!), Bread (TIP: ask for the butter on the side they smear it all over the top of each piece) 
 

 Atmosphere : The ambiance of Kincaid’s is that of a sailing restaurant sporting a stunning view of the Ward Center harbor. They also have various sailing pictures and instruments as the featured art to tie the theme together. The tables and chairs are super dated. With a serious makeover and this restaurant could really have a unique and upscale feel.

 Consistency: Its been over 4 years since we have eaten at Kincaid’s so we promise to update this section once we return. However, the consistency between the dishes was so-so. We had two really great dishes, one OK dish, and one“send it back”dish which doesn’t say alot about the restaurants overall consistency–or lack there of!

 Parking : Parking is a breeze at Kincaid’s. They have ample outdoor parking at Ward Warehouse and the overall Ward area but it is also a very popular mall with the movie theater across the street. If you can’t find a spot try the parking garage in the Ward Warehouse building–its huge and your sure to find something.

 SOUL – Cuisine with Aloha&amp;Spice 
 August 26th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service was the best thing about SOUL. The restaurant is a mesh of full service and plate lunch get it yourself service. You are seated by a waitress and given menus, water and a very pleasant smile! then once you decide what you want to eat you need to go and order at the counter, pay and then be re-seated. Once your order is complete the waitress brings it out to you and also clears the table. Both waitresses where absolutely jewels. Both exceptionally friendly and helpful–to bad the food was crap!

 Food : We where soooooo very excited to try this place as the menu was mouth watering…sadly it was some of the worst food we have had in a while! they should name the restaurant Soul–Cuisine with Salt&amp;Frozen Ingredients! The cuisine menu is a mixture (as promised) of Southern food and Hawaiian comfort food. Staple items on the menu include Seafood Gumbo&amp;Grits, Pulled Pork, BBQ Ribs, Fried Chicken, Feta&amp;Crab Mac&amp;Cheese (sounds delicious), Jambalaya etc. The food was all pretty bad, the ribs where fatty and chewy–everything was kind of old tasting and very salty. The trout was fishy, the salad was over dressed and the mash potato’s where even cold…they tasted like glue….. everything was pretty disgusting! The salad we ordered was the best thing and lets face it, it is pretty hard to screw up mixed greens! that being said, the salad was named“Avocado and Papaya Salad”which would indicate more than 1 piece of papaya and 1 little piece of avocado. False advertising 4 sure!  and overall the restaurant is pretty darn expensive for the shabby quality of ingredients served.

 Favorite Dishes: To put it bluntly–we didn’t like anything. The best thing was the wine we brought with us!!  The Avacado&amp;Papaya Salad was the best thing we ate (see Food above). The Fried Chicken did look delicious, but we didn’t try it this time around. Our waitress did say her favorite thing was Shrimp and Grits but–again…. can’t recommend anything from this visit!

 Atmosphere : We enjoyed the atmosphere at Soul very much. It is a cute little dive with a fun personality and was pretty clean. You can site either outside (about 3 tables) or inside (about 10 tables) which is nice for variety. They had interesting art and the overall place feels pleasant once inside. They also had great music–not loud at all and very easy going Island style beats.

 Consistency: Well we have only been once and after such terrible food it will be extremely hard to go back and give this restaurant another shot. In the spirit of fairness and for the benefit of our readers we will go again and update this review at that time….. so stay tuned!

 Parking : Well as all restaurants in this little mini mecca of Kaimuki there is very limited free parking for the 6 restaurants guests. If you go early and are lucky you can snag a spot (no more than 20 in front and back). If you are unlucky or go after 6:30 you can park for $5 at the lot across the street and hope you don’t get a ticket (which has happened to us before). Good luck!

 Richo 
 November 28th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service was laugh out loud bad! it was just ridiculous. I mean they where very nice but terribly at serving. In fact, it took me three try’s to get them to remove an almost empty dish (the salad and all that was left was some pathetic limp lettuce doused in dressing). Its so annoying when they leave complete dishes to clutter your already small table. Also they brought us cold towels and pointed out they are usually hot–and our waiter didn’t know the different between Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris so it took a while to get even a drink at this establishment.

 Food : Most absolutely the worst Korean food we have ever had. They also don’t have the BBQ grill on the table or even the portable grilling option which is rather strange for a Korean restaurant…the owner did say it was part Japanese so maybe that’s the Japanese influence? At any rate it was surely missed specially when the other food was less than impressive.

 Favorite Dishes: Note–nothing was really good but these where not as bad: Seaweed Springrolls (tasty and creative but very oily), Bulkogi Salad (lean meat but way over dressed) , Leek Chijimi (like a pancake this was the best dish)–Do not order the Tofu Salad the tofu was rancid or the pickle / kimchi sampler it was awful.

 Atmosphere : The Atmosphere of Richo is wonderful! they have floor table seating on the edge of the restaurant which are unique and can be fun for a date. The main seating tables and chairs which are also very modern and elegant in dark tones. The sushi bar sites at the back of the restaurant hiding the kitchen and creating a nice focal point for the guests facing that direction. The bathrooms where very clean and smelled great. If the food was better this would be a great place to go with its dim lighting and an overall aesthetic appeal.

 Consistency: We will never go again to Richo. It was so bad it doesn’t even deserve another chance. If you want a good recommendation don’t wast your money or calories on this restaurant.

 Parking : Parking is a breeze at Richo which was nice seeing how the food and service where so unacceptable. They have free parking in there lot located to the left of the door and once that fills up you can park in most of the stalls in the lot to the right of the entrance. It shares a few slots with some vendors but at night they are all closed so the entire lot is free for Richo guests.

 Indigo’s 
 November 2nd, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : Service is always pleasant at Indigo’s. The staff wears cool Balinese looking uniforms which match the decor of the restaurant which is always fun. The bar tenders in particular are always very attentive and make the best drinks! overall the staff is very good unless you go on First Friday when the crowds take over.

 Food : The food at Indigo’s is a bit of a mesh between Asian, Mediterranean and French with an modern island spin. The menu has a good variety of dishes including interesting hot appetizers, salads, fish, and poultry–It is recommended to go for lunch and try the buffet instead of going for dinner. The lunch menu is very limited but if you get the buffet it is a good deal and you won’t be disappointed (note you cannot order from the dinner menu at lunch). They also have one of the most fantastic happy hours in town with over 30 Martinis to choose from all for only $4. It truly is Martini Madness and a great place for Pau Hana with friends after work (beers $3 and discount on Appetizers as well).

 Favorite Dishes: For Lunch–Roasted Tomato Garlic Crab Soup (YUM!), or the best is to get the $15.95 lunch buffet–delicious assortment of cooked vegetables, seasonal composed salads, fresh fish, chicken, noddles, potatoes, pizza, hummus and at times warm appetizers. For Dinner–Tempura Ahi Roll, Watercress Salad, and Steamed Fish with Sizzling scallion oil

 Atmosphere : Love Love Love the atmosphere at Indigo’s! Its so unique that nothing on the island compares to it. The restaurant has various seating areas all showcasing a different experience. The main dinning area has high ceilings and very modern tropical art&amp;furniture. My personal favorite is the outdoor patio seating which feels a bit like Bali and you can enjoy a glass of wine as you can gaze over the garden outside. There are also two other bar areas and the Green Room is a wonderful place to meet friends after work and enjoy happy hour (Martinis to dye for!–big and cold) or for the late night crowed they have a dance room in the back.

 Consistency: Lunch and Happy Hour are consistently terrific at Indigo’s. Great place to take an out of town guest if you go downtown for any reason!

 Parking : Yup parking is not pleasant downtown but there are ample municipal parking structures you can select from. The cheapest one is located on Beretania on the right hand size of the street right after you pass Nuuanu Street (NOTE: this parking garage closes at 12pm and your car will be locked in so if you park here–make it an early night). Also Indigo’s has a valet service for $5-$6 dollars which is attractive at night when its harder to find a parking space.

 12th Ave Grill 
 September 13th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service was so-so. The waiter took his time taking our orders and wasn’t very knowledgeable about the menu–in fact he even had to come back twice to inform us the items we ordered where no longer available. I mean if you only have 5 desserts and 3 are out how hard is it to remember what you DO have? Its not rocket science!  Also if your not going to put the wine we ordered on the table for us to fill up ourselves than it would be reasonable to think the waiter would frequently check back on our glass status…. unfortunately this was not the case. We give it a big two thumbs down on the service.

 Foo d: ummm where to begin…. about half of the food we ordered was pretty good and half was uneatable and just plan laugh out loud bad. The scallops from the specials menu where undercooked and rubbery. The pecan pie sandwich was burned and actually so unappetizing we sent it back. Another person ordered the Afogado which was believe it or not…pre-made and had freezer burn all over it…. I mean it’s ice cream–does it really need to be pre-glassed? How lazy can you get! Also when the menu noted it should come“drowned”in an expresso shot one would think it would be a warm fresh shot that was poured over the ice cream. Not a little frozen glob of cold espresso stuck to the  bottom of the glass–that’s just GROSS. On the positive note we did have two good entrees including the Opah fresh catch of the day and the BBQ Spare Ribs which just feel right off the bone and where delicious. The sides where few and far between, and over seasoned but it was the best thing we ate that night. The menu does change seasonally and 12th Ave Grill offers a lot of daily specials–however, being a personal chef I can say its better to have less specials and really make sure your core dishes are properly executed than to have new dishes all the time that are missing crucial elements or not cooked properly.
 Download 12th Ave Grill Menu in Honolulu 

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Fish of the Day, BBQ Maui Cattle Co. Short Ribs, and Baked Macaroni&amp;Cheese

 Atmosphere : The 12 Ave Grill is a cute little restaurant. The atmosphere is warm–with light/cheery wood furniture, orange dim lights and small in diameter. The restaurant also has a small unique bar seating area which is charming and nice if you are solo or + 1. The worst thing about this restaurant is the noise factor. It has such bad acoustics that when full its really hard to hear the people at your table without screaming at each other. Not very pleasant and def not recommended for a first date where you want to get to know someone better. (TIP: if you decide to try it out–go early or go late–too avoid a full restaurant so you can at least hear yourself think! or…. and its recommended to go somewhere else!)

 Consistency: Consistently the dishes are pretty bad. It’s been 4 years since we have been and I would be lying if I said it would we would return before another 4 passes at least!

 Parking : Parking is pretty easy at 12th Ave Grill. The restaurant is located close to the Kamuki shopping center on the side street between Koko Head Ave and 12th Ave. So the best place to park is the maniciple parking lot right next to it which has metered parking. If you can’t find a spot you can go to the other parking lot (where the Big City Diner is located) which has ticketed parking ($1 per hour).

 Mexico Resturant 
 December 20th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is usually excellent at Mexico restaurant and the food comes out of the kitchen really fast. The best waiter is actually Mexican so if you see him there its worth your while to site in his corner as he can really“work a room.”Only one time have we had a really crappy waitress who left our food sitting on the window ledge for a good 10 min before serving it cold and soggy which has pretty disappointing.

 Foo d: The food is average-good. Its not the best Mexican food we have ever had, however, its one of the best in Hawaii for sure. They have all the traditional dishes, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and a full bar stocked with tequila and a variety of beers. The chips and salsa are really good and they must make them fresh daily so try not to fill up before your huge entree arrives. One thing that is really nice about Mexico Restaurant is that they offer some healthy options including grilled fish tacos&amp;burritos served with salad instead of fried with beans&amp;rice.

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Burrito, Tamale, Mixed Fajitas (Come out sizzling and large enough to share!), Salsa, Chips,  Beans&amp;Rice, and ALL the salads (TIP- if you like Crab is da fresh kind!).

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is one of the best things about this restaurant. Its really spacious and themed to perfection. The bar is very quaint and the tables, art and vibe is totally Mexican through and through. It’s a nice place to meet with friends or have a bite with your family as its kid friendly and overall very casual.

 Consistency: The consistency is good. We have been 4-6 times and its pretty consistent. The food is just average Mexican food and nothing fancy so if your itching for a fixing…. Mexico restaurant is a good place to come even though its a bit out of the way.

 Parking : There is free parking at Mexico Restaurant. The lot, however, is super small and can be difficult to park in during lunch or peak dinner time when the place is packed. Most often for dinner they have a valet guy outside to help customers so if you need help it may be available and will need it to get out of that lot in the dark…especially after a margarita or two!

 Mexitlan Grill–OUT OF BUSINESS 
 December 5th, 2010 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is excellent at Mexitlan Grill which is a relief since the restaurant is extremely small in size (about 8 tables total). The service is very friendly and attentive making it a very enjoyable restaurant for both a quick bite for lunch or dinner out with friends.

 Foo d: The food is authentic Mexican through and through. It’s wonderful to finally get a good Mexican restaurant in Honolulu that has more than just some run-of-the-mill burritos,  enchiladas and tacos. The restaurant proteins include fresh Fish, Lobster, Beef Tongue, Shredded Beef, Asada, Cochinita, Orange Pork, Chicken and more!  The salsa is fresh and once you start eating it you will want to put it on everything.  In fact, last time we ate at Mexitlan we got to experience them roasting the tomatoes fresh for the salsa because part of the grill opens up into the dining area…it was authentic and fun to watch.

 Favorite Dishes: Chili Relleno (yum!), Fish Wrap, Tacos–Chicken, Beef Tongue, Cochinita, and the Enchiladas.

 Atmosphere : The first thoughts that come to mind are–quaint, traditional, and charming. Even though the restaurant is small and doesn’t have any views they really decorated it perfectly and it doesn’t feel claustrophobic or crowed. Mexitlan has  beautiful artwork and authentic decorations which give the overall ambiance an A+.

 Consistency: The food is consistently good. The restaurant is very new so we only have eaten at this establishment a few times but everything was very good and we are excited to go back again soon!

 Parking : There is a private lot at the Kaimuki Shopping Center which has plenty of parking for about $1 per hour. If you are lucky you can also score 3 free street parking in front of Big City Diner and walking through the restaurant.

 Price Range: Medium ($10-$22) per Entree

 Easy Apple&amp;Mango Crisps 
 December 3rd, 2010 
 Servers: 12 (6 ounce) individual Crisp or large 13 x 9 x 2 Baking Dish
 Cooking Time: 1.5 hours

 Filling Ingredients 
4 large granny smith apples, medium size dice
2 large ripe mango, medium size dice
1 lemon zest and juiced
1-teaspoon cinnamon
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup white granulated sugar
3 tablespoons Grand Marnier (optional)
1-tablespoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons corn starch
Topping
1 pouch (1 lb 1.5 oz) Betty Crocker oatmeal cookie mix
1/2-cup butter, melted
1-tablespoon pure vanilla extract

 Directions 
Preheat oven to 300° degrees. Peel, core and dice the apples and mangoes. In a large bowl place diced apples and Mangos along with the remaining filling ingredients and toss together. Spray bottom and sides of desired baking dish or individual ramekins with cooking spray. Arrange the fruit mixture evenly in the baking dish or ramekins and set aside. To prepare the topping add oatmeal cookie mix, melted butter and vanilla to a medium size bowl and mix together until crumbly. Sprinkle the topping evenly over fruit filling and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until topping is golden brown. If you notice during the cooking process that the topping is getting to dark, cover with tin foil and place back in the oven. Serve warm or at room temperature with a favorite ice cream. For a lighter approach try serving with low fat frozen yogurt or non-fat Greek yogurt.

Food for thought: Did you know that ½ Teaspoon of Cinnamon equals the same amount of antioxidants in ¼ cup of Blueberries.

 Bella Mia 
 January 3rd, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is ok at Bella Mia. The staff is friendly and its a family owned business which is always nice. Both times we have been the service staff was welcoming and full of smiles. I wouldn’t say the service is fast but the food comes out quickly and the overall its pleasant.

 Foo d: The dishes are huge at Bella Mia and absolutely large enough to share or for you to bring home for a second meal. They have everything you would imaging a from a NY-Italian restaurant including pasta, pizza, and a few salads. The marinara sauce and hot bread they serve you is delicious! its hot and the sauce is so good you could drink it. I would recommend going for lunch and having a salad and the bread as an appetizer it would be a perfect meal. The pasta was pretty good as well but was a bit overcooked.

 Favorite Dishes: Greek Salad, Free Bread and Marinara Sauce

 Atmosphere : The motif of Bella Mia is that of a casual, family style NY Italian restaurant. The table clothes are the traditional checkers of red and white. They have a pizza window and fun pictures and nick knacks around to give the ambiance that of a comfortable family-dive restaurant. Its the type of place you can bring kids and they can spill marinara sauce all over the floor without a second thought. The tables and chairs are miss matched which adds to the charm of this Italian family business.

 Consistency: Both times we have been the food was consistently OK.

 Parking : Parking is easy at Bella Mia because the restaurant is in the Kaimuki Shopping Center. You can find ample parking (most of the time) for only $1 for the first hour.

 Price Range: Medium ($10-$22) per Entree

 Grilled Sweet Chili Chicken Wings 
 December 10th, 2010 
 Servers: 4 to 6 people
 Cooking Time: 2 Hour
 

 Ingredients 
3 pounds Chicken Wings 
Marinade 
3 Tablespoons Garlic
3 Tablespoons Ginger
2 Tablespoons Tum Yum Paste (optional)
5-ounce Kikkoman Tempura Sauce
12-ounce bottle of Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce
2 Tablespoons Fish Sauce
1 Bunch Cilantro

 Directions 
Place all marinade ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. In a large bowl or pan evenly incorporate half of the marinade over the chicken wings and mix well. Reserve the remaining marinade for later. Place the marinated wings back in refrigerator for one hour. For best tasting wings marinate over night. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Grilled chicken wings tend to flare up quite a bit on the grill, so it’s a good idea to get a squirt bottle and fill it with water (or glass of water ready) just in case. If you see a flare-up, just squirt it down with a little water so it doesn’t char the wings. A squirt bottle is the favorite tool of many grillers I know! Pick up a cheap one at the supermarket if you don’t have one already, it’s the cheapest and most important tool you can have near the grill for these more fatty meats.

Grill over medium high heat until crisp and lightly charred about 20 minutes. While grilling preheat oven to 400 degrees, Once you achieved a nice grill marks, place wings in a oven safe dish and pour remaining marinade over wings and place in oven to cook for another 20 minutes or until well cooked. Serve with your favorite side dishes such as brown rice or potato salad.

 Shokudo 
 January 10th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is so so at Shokudo. The food is either really fast or super slow and you never know how long it will take for lunch. Its my recommendation to take your time and only go to Shokudo if you are not in a rush so you can really enjoy the food and atmosphere no matter how busy the kitchen is.  The waiters are really friendly and conversational which makes the restaurant a nice place to go.

 Foo d: The Food at Shokudo is very tasty. Its typical Japanese food with a global twist and menu items include Sushi, Tempura, Noodles, Pupus, Salads, and Rice dishes. The food is pretty basic but they do have some“out of the box”items which make this restaurant unique and memorable. The best way to enjoy the innovative cuisine is to share the dishes family style. They also have bento boxes for Lunch at a very reasonable price and the bar is open late night serving food until 12pm on the week days and 1pm on Friday&amp;Saturday night.
 Shokudo Menu For Download 

 Favorite Dishes: Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice (extremely good–instead of cold rice they serve the sushi on puffed cooked rice), Spider Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Fries, Edamame, Tempura, and Fresh Homemade Tofu

 Atmosphere : In Japanese Shokudo means“dinning room”and we would have to agree that the ambiance of Shokudo is wonderful. The restaurant has high ceilings and two unique sides and designs with booth seating and regular table seating. The restaurant also has a private room in the back for large parties. Shokudo is a great place to bring a date because its trendy, and you can feel comfortable and in style dressed casually or island chic. 
 

 Consistency: The consistency is pretty good at Shokudo. Its a good place to take out of town guests or meet friends for reasonable priced pupus after work.

 Parking : Validated parking entrance on Kona Street, behind the restaurant. Or you can park in the Ala Moana shopping center and walk over.

 Price Range: Low-Medium ($5-$25) per Entree 
Corkage Fee $15 per bottle Wine (no other liquor is permitted to bring yourself)

 Nobu 
 January 19th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service at Nobu is exceptional. Each waiter is very professional and you know you are sure to get stellar service when you go for dinner or drinks. The sushi bar in particular has excellent service and it is fun to watch the sushi masters create each roll.

 Foo d: Wow the food is above and beyond delicious at Nobu! each bite is packed with unique clean flavors that dance on your tongue. Nobu has a wide variety of dishes from sushi to salads with exotic global flavors. Each dish created by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa is well balanced and the sashimi is so fresh it melts in your mouth. No matter what you order its  sure to be memorable and super yummy. They also have a fantastic happy hour Monday-Friday 5-7pm in the lounge area with special dishes, $4 beers and $8 martinis.

 Favorite Dishes: Spider Rolls, Nobu Tacos (Lobster and Crab), Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Eggplant with Misa, Miso Black Cod, Salmon New Style Sashimi, Shitake Salad, Sakitini (Sake Martini–cold and fresh), EVERYTHING

 Atmosphere : We just love the atmosphere at Nobu. The restaurant is very grand with high ceilings and red/ gold color scheme. The lamps are also very trendy and have a modern meets antique feel to them. The tables are dark wood and there are both circular tables and booth seating available. Although the restaurant is large its not very noise which makes it the one of the best restaurants in town. The bar/lounge area is also lovely and very chic feeling. Its nice to go for a drink before dinner or even to have dinner at the bar with a friend.

 Consistency: This restaurant receives my top personal chef approval for being one of the best Japanese restaurants in Hawaii. Each dish is always consistently tasty and you know what to expect.

 Parking : Nobu offers Validated parking at the hotel.

 Morimotos 
 January 18th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service at Morimotos is not much to sing about. Both times we have eaten it was slow from taking the order, to receiving our drinks as well as our food. Its fair to say this is a type of restaurant that you go to enjoy a non-rushed lengthy meal, however, some things you don’t want to wait a 30 minutes for including your wine.

 Foo d: The food was good but overall a bit disappointing. Knowing that Morimoto is an iron chef we were expecting some really out of this world dishes but nothing really stands out as the best. The food is artistic and very well plated which makes the experience interesting. The food was overall good but we felt his best dishes were the ones that concentrated more on flavor than jazz.  The only negative thing we can say was that the first time we ate at Morimotos we got sick on the Pastrami Sashimi which was disappointing especial when you pay $20 for the dish.
 Download Morimotos Menu In Waikiki 

 Favorite Dishes: Tofu, Gioza, Bisque, Caprachio, Morimoto Sashimi

 Atmosphere : The ambiance at Morimotos is just beautiful. Both outdoor and indoor venues are zen and well designed. The green and dark wood tones are well balanced and the overall feel of the restaurant is trendy. The outside is much more enjoyable with lounge music, couches and fire pits for mingling. The inside has enlarged images of orchids and moss embedded clear tables. we recommend sitting outside because the indoor seating is so loud you can barely hear your dinning companions without screaming.

 Consistency: Well the first time we didn’t have a very good experience with getting sick, however, when we went back again for dinner the food was good. I think the dinner menu is more exciting than the lunch menu so we would recommend going for an early dinner and sharing some dishes with friends.

 Parking : Parking is complimentary with validation at The New Edition Hotel. Don’t forget to stop at the downstairs bar on the way out for a custom handmade martini! delicious…

 Wahoo Fish Taco’s 
 January 18th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The table service was good at Wahoo’s in Kahala and was a welcome change from the location at Ward Center where you have to service yourself. The staff is friendly and in-line with the company vision.

 Foo d: The food is ok at Wahoo’s Fish Taco’s. It’s really basic food nothing special or so good that you can’t wait to go back but it is very inexpensive and good for the price. They also have alot of specials each day including Taco Tuesdays with $2 tacos, as well as other Happy Hour items making it a fun place to go with friends.

 Favorite Dishes: Wahoo’s Salad, Fish Tacos, Chicken Tortilla Soup

 Atmosphere : The ambiance at Wahoo’s is fun and casual. It’s a mix between a local hangout and fast food joint. Both locations have great layouts with both indoor and outdoor seating options. The Ward location is more like a fast-food restaurant but the Kahala one is more upscale and has a full bar and table seating. It’s a great place to go for happy hour and grab some drinks with friends PLUS they have free music at each location during select times (see hours of operation below)

 Consistency: Its consistently ok at Wahoo’s. The fish is fresh and tastes consistently not fishy which is always a plus.

 Parking : Both locations have free parking lots and or street parking (at Ward metered and in Kahala free).

 Price Range: Low ($10 and under) per Entree

 Migawon Korean Resturant 
 January 25th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : Well the service at Migawon on Kapiolani blvd was overall pretty bad. The moment we walked in we were greeted with smiles (most likely excitement because no one else was in the restaurant) but it didn’t last long. At one point we asked for some napkins and the lady pointed to the corner table where they were located! I mean really? its not like they didn’t have the time to service the only customers in the restaurant. Also they barely spoke English and it took two of them to figure out what we wanted.

 Foo d: The food was pretty competitively priced with other Korean BBQ places in town, but Migawon only gave you 5 lousy kimchi sides which were not very good and very disappointing. In fact, we only asked them to refill one of them (the bean sprouts) which is not what you want when you spend $20+ per a person. The menu was pretty typical they had both BBQ options and regular menu items including stews, pancakes, bi bim bap, etc. It was memorable…. but not in a good way.

 Favorite Dishes: BBQ Chicken, Boneless Kalbi, Lettuce&amp;Seaweed (for wrapping meat and rice).

 Atmosphere : WOW the atmosphere at Migawon is just awful. It’s dirty, has zero personalty and was thrown together with a mish-mash of tables and chairs. The music was like a techno pop which was really strange for a Korean restaurant and flies/gnats were flying around us the whole meal which is super unappetizing.

 Consistency: We have only been once and we will never return. Honestly this place is not long for this world. I can’t imagine it being around for longer than 3 months.

 Parking : They do offer parking but its really unclear where that was exactly. We ended up paying to park down that back ale off of Kalakaua and Kapiolani.

 Price Range: Medium ($20-$27) per BBQ Entree

 Papa John’s Pizza 
 June 13th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The services is great at Papa John’s. From the delivery boys to the pizza makers the team at Papa John’s do a good job specially for a fast food restaurant. In fact, we had a pretty bad experience with a new location and after writing to corporate was pleasantly surprised to receive 2 free large pizza cards in the mail–now thats good service!

 Foo d: The pizza is good at at Papa John’s. From thin crust to regular the dough is not oily and the ingredients are fresh as promised. The chicken wings and other items are not as much of a slam dunk but if you are in the mood the honey Chipotle Wings are pretty tasty.

 Favorite Dishes: Thin Crust Pizza with Chicken, Peppers, and Onion, Hawaiian Pizza

 Atmosphere : Well since we NEVER eat at Papa John’s its really hard to say but I have been into a few locations and they are always clean which is a plus for the ambiance. Really its not a place you want to site and eat unless maybe its raining outside or if you are hungry after some drinks on your way home and itching for some slicest.

 Consistency: The Kapiolani blvd location has always had the best and most consistent pizza in our option. After we moved to a new district we have struggled with pizza consistency and often times the wrong ingredients are on the pie or its cold when it arrives which never used to happen…. so i guess it depends on your location and the management!

 Parking : Most Papa John’s locations have some designed spots for pickup or are in locations where they have ample parking so if you are swinging by after work don’t worry you should be in good shape no matter what.

 Price Range: Medium-High ($16-$26.99) per Large Pizza (Papa Johns always has Daily Specials so Ask!)

 Los Chaparros Mexican Restaurant 
 March 28th, 2011 
 Overall: 

 Service : The service is always ok at Los Chaparros Mexican restaurant on Beretania street. It’s a small restaurant and they usually only have one server for the entire facility so it can take a while…. TIP don’t go to this restaurant if you are in a rush or you will be sorry! that being said, the staff is always very friendly and happy to see you when you arrive.

 Foo d: The Mexican food at Los Chaparros is so so. One nice thing to point out is they use white meat for the chicken which many Mexican restaurants don’t. The food was ok but nothing that is extremely memorable or leaves you smacking your lips for more. Overall the food could use a little more seasoning and even the chips and salsa needed a little love. You can find anything you could want from a Mexican Restaurant on Los Chaparros menu including Tacos, Enchiladas, Quesadillas, Carnitas, Carne Asada, Fajitas, Burritos, Chimichanga’s, Chili Rellenos, etc. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: The Fish Tacos, Enchiladas with salsa verde

 Atmosphere : This restaurant doesn’t have the greatest ambiance. It’s very dark and kind of gloomy. They tried to brighten it up with flags and colored walls but the overall feel is washed out and a bit dated. The music is traditional and awesome…it really adds a nice touch to the experience but watch out for the table directly under the speaker it is so loud you can barely hear yourself think!

 Consistency: We have been a few times and its always consistently ok. Prob won’t go back again anytime soon now that the new Mexitlan restaurant that opened in Kaimuki and is much more fun and authentic!

 Parking : YES Los Chaparros has free parking. The lot is directly in front of the restaurant and is fairly limited in size (at least 5-8 spots). The restaurant is on the right hand side of Beretania street so make sure not to miss the restaurant or you have to take a long detour back.

 Genke Sushi 
 January 29th, 2011 
 Overall Rating: 

 Service : The service is good at Genke Sushi restaurants in Hawaii. The staff is super friendly and very attentive. In fact, at the Kapahulu location in particular we have had the best service and before you even realize you need something your waiter is either bringing it or right by your side to fulfill your request which is always great when you go out.

 Foo d: The food isn’t anything super fancy or even very creative but its good and cheap! Genke Sushi has a fun conveyor belt which rotates around the diners with various sushi rolls and food items like salads, edamame, etc. It is really a great way to enjoy a quick meal because while ordering off the menu you can grab an appetizer roll to hold you over. Basic items you can expect on the menu include Miso soup, Sashimi, Teriyaki Bowls, Salads, Udon Noodles, etc.
 Genki Sushi Menu For Download 

 Favorite Dishes: Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, California Hand Roll, Salmon Cream Cheese Roll, Softshell Crab Roll, Tempura Roll, Edamame, and Miso Soup

 Atmosphere : The ambiance at Genke Sushi is very open and clean. The conveyor belt is the focus on each location (as it should be!) but Genke Sushi does a good job of building restaurants which are warm and inviting. The logo guy is unforgettable and is featured throughout art in each location making Genke Sushi a unique place to take out-of-town guests.

 Consistency: Genke Sushi is very consistent. Each time we go we always eat the Ahi Tuna hand roll and it tastes exactly the same each time.

 Parking : Each Genke Sushi location has free parking! the location in Honolulu which is hardest to park is the location on Kapahulu which only has about 10 parking spots, however, you can generally find a spot on the street or in Safeway’s lot across the street.

 Price Range: Low ($1.50-$4.80) per Dish

 Teddy’s Bigger Burger 
 March 23rd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The staff was super friendly at Teddy’s. They are fast on their feet and full of smiles. They where quick to whip down the tables between eaters despite how busy and managed to get the food out in a timely manner. We give Teddies Bigger Burger on Beretania Street two thumbs up.

 Foo d: The food is pretty tasty at Teddy’s Bigger Burger in Honolulu. The food is what you would find in a common dinner with ice cream, onion rings, burgers and fries. What makes Teddy’s so good is that the burgers are made fresh to order and from 100% ground chuck. The chicken on the combo was also very juicy, moist and well seasoned. The buns were fresh and soft and all the ingredients from salads to fries where high quality. They also have a happy hour Monday–Thursday 2pm-5pm for $1 OFF any combo order.
 Teddy’s Bigger Burger Menu For Download 

 Favorite Dishes: Baco Salad (7oz hamburger, avocado, cheese, tomato, bacon), Chicken Combo Sandwhich, Fries

 Atmosphere : We really like the atmosphere at Teddy’s Bigger Burger. They are fun and designed like an old dinner. The color scheme is red, yellow and black and from the tables to the art on the walls the casual and hang loose 50′s theme keeps this restaurant young, trendy and fun.

 Consistency: We only have been once so far but the restaurant was absolutely packed! we promise to update this section again next time we visit Teddy’s for a quick burger fix.

 Parking : The Teddy’s location on Beretania has a good sized parking lot with over 10 spots making this an easy restaurant to go for lunch or a quick bite while shopping in town.

 Mai Lan Vietnamese Restaurant 
 February 27th, 2011 
 Overall Rating: 

 Service : The service was pretty good at Mai Lan Vietnamese restaurant in Honolulu. It appears to be family owned (always nice touch!) and our waitress was full of smiles even as she told us they are open 365 days a year…now that’s service! Also the second time we went we brought our own wine and since we ordered the crab (the most expensive item on the menu and worth every dollar) they let us drink our wine for free (normally corkage fee of $8) which is really great service.

 Foo d: Yummmmy is all that we can say about the fresh crab curry with french bread. It is $32 but incredibility delicious and enough for 2 people! I would go back in a heart beat for that crab and its always nice to see them catching your little crustaceans fresh from the tank. Items you can expect to find on the menu include Vietnamese cold noodles, broken rice dishes, curry, soup, specialties, entrees, salads, etc. The restaurant also gives you fresh Ramutan’s for dessert which is really a nice way to finish the meal.
 Download Mai Lan Vietnamese Menu in Honolulu 

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh Crab Curry with French Bread, Ramutan’s (TIP: Don’t order the spring rolls we found to be little mushy inside)

 Atmosphere : The ambiance could use some work at Mai Lan. Nothing really is very interesting on the inside and the restaurant has about 14 not to fancy tables plus a special room of to the side for larger parties. The artwork is pretty nice.

 Consistency: Both times we have been the crab was so delicious we are already counting the days before we can return again for a fix.

 Parking : Mai Lan does offer free parking next to the restaurant but the lot only has 6-8 spots. We recommend taking a taxi cab (the corkage fee is so cheap you can drink 2 bottles of wine!) or car pool with friends.

 Lulu’s Waikiki 
 February 21st, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is pretty good at Lulu’s. However, both times we have been recently they got our order wrong. They always correct the dish with lots of apologies but still its annoying to wait for your food to come out while everyone else at the table has lunch / dinner. It’s either the servers or the kitchen line but it shouldn’t be hard to make a salad without dressing!

 Foo d: The food is run-of-the-mill American food. It’s not really exciting or always very good but its inexpensive and they have something on the menu for everyone. Menu selections include great appetizers to share with table, sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, steaks and seafood, etc. They also serve traditional breakfast with omelets, pancakes, local favorites like Loco Moco (and keep a few breakfast items on the lunch menu for those late risers which is considerate).

 Favorite Dishes: Kalua Pork Nachos, Chicken Tenders, Grilled Chicken Sandwhich, Mahi Mahi Sandwhich, Grilled Island“Catch”Salad, Long Island Cobb Salad, and the Cajun Fries.

 Atmosphere : We really like the atmosphere at Lulu’s in Waikiki! The ambiance is by far the best thing going for this restaurant along with its location. The restaurant is on the second story with large windows and a fantastic unobstructed view of the ocean&amp;Waikiki strip. The palm trees are beautiful and its a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the sunset with friends for a causal lunch, dinner or pupu’s after work.

 Consistency: The consistency is not so good. It’s rare they don’t get an order wrong or put a different ingredient on your dish from the last time you went. In fact, last time we ordered the Mahi Mahi sandwich and salad and they used Swordfish which was the“Fish of the Day”on both so either someone got confused or they ran out and figured we where tourists and wouldn’t notice. I mean they should at least point it out some people don’t eat Swordfish and may appreciate the opportunity to change their order for something else in stock.

 Parking : The only place you can park even close to Lulu’s is in the Kapiolani beach park right across the street. Don’t forget they replaced the meter parking with the pay ticket station so their is no need to bring a bucket of quarters with you anymore (TIP: the machine only accepts credit cards).

 March 16th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service at Kirin Restaurant on Beretania Street was ok. The staff was very friendly and curious but at times slow to respond. They never came around to refill our water glasses (the entire meal) even though they where completely empty. It also took a pretty lengthily amount of time to order and pay the check so if you go for lunch or dinner plan extra time before catching a movie or a plane.

 Foo d: The Chinese food was good at Kirin Restaurant! the noodles and rice dishes where both very tasty and not oily. The dim sum was also pretty good but we thought the dumplings wrappers where way to thick (and the filling to little). The menu has both dim sum and the typical proteins, seafood, noodles, rice and vegetables such as Flat Noodles, Kao Bao Chicken, Tea Smoked Duck, Fried Rice, Dim Sum, etc. Something that makes Kirin Restaurant stand out is that they make the dim sum fresh to order (and without MSG should you ask). 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Stir fried rice noodle with shrimp and curry, Chinese style pickled cucumber, Tofu Dim Sum, and Chicken Fried Rice. (TIP: Don’t order dumplings they are extremely doughy)

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is very nice at Kirin Restaurant. The layout of the tables is very open so you are not to close to your neighbors and they have beautiful artwork on the walls. Even the tables are nice and made out of old wood giving this restaurant ambiance a warm homely feel.

 Consistency: Both times we have been have been consistently good. Being a private chef in Hawaii I always appreciate good noodles&amp;rice dishes because most places use to much oil or over cook the noodles. Both times we had items we where not crazy about but overall the food has been good and we are excited to go back.

 Parking : Kirin restaurant on Beretania has some free parking outside about 9 spots. Or the new longs (old Star Market) is right across the street and you can park there (buy some wine) and walk across the street to dinner.

 Price Range: Low ($8.95-$46) per Entree&amp;($2.95-$4.50) per Dim Sum 
Corkage Fee only $2 per person!

 Sushi Sasabune 
 July 26th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is exceptional at Sushi Sasabune on King Street. The waiters are veterans and always remember the guests who keep on coming back. They are friendly, knowledgeable, polite and quick which is all you can ever ask of a good restaurant.

 Foo d: The food is to die for! the key phrase is“Trust Me”at Sushi Sasabune because you don’t order par-say but rather the chef brings you select items which are the freshest and most delicious he has to offer, dish by dish until you are full. If you are a regular you can also request different dishes (on his tasting menu) but you have to eat a few times to get aquatinted with the food enough to do be able to ask for them by name. The sushi is so fresh it melts in your mouth and is presented on top of warm sushi rice giving it a unique and memorable taste. Each bite is a true celebration. Enjoy!! 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Blue crab hand roll, the squid stuffed with blue crab, the scallop and salmon duo, everything!

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is very nice at Sasabune. The restaurant is small and quaint with a sushi bar and about 5-8 tables. The decor is very clean yet trendy for a Japanese restaurant and showcases a few beautiful pieces of artwork and black, red and gold color scheme.

 Consistency: Each time you go to Sasabune you can feel secure that it will fantastic. The consistency is top notch and we have never had a dish that wasn’t superb or fishy fish.

 Parking : Sushi Sasabune has a small parking lot out back that may be shared with some other restaurants in the area but typically you can always find a spot. If not and its not during rush hour you can find parking on king street.

 Price Range: High–Dinner about $125 per Person

 Cartlidge&amp;Browne 
 May 15th, 2011 
 Overall Wine Review: 

 Varietal: Cabernet Sauvignon

 Vintages: 2008

 Country: California, USA

 Essence of : When I first open this wine I had aromas of dried strawberries and tons of alcohol, it was overwhelming. I took a sip and was disappointed. The tannins are very harsh and overpowered the fruit in the wine, not well balanced at first / Bits recommended to let this wine sit and breath for 15 to 20 min the flavors begin to settle down and the fruit comes into place. / Notes of cedar and bits of vanilla and spice come out once the alcohol subsides, but the tannins remain very apparent with a lingering long finish.

 Best Served With : Gamey&amp;Grilled Meats

 P rice Range: Under $15 per bottle

 Grayson Cellars, Lot 10 
 April 4th, 2011 
 Overall Wine Review: 

 Varietal: Cabernet Sauvignon

 Vintages: 2009

 Country: California, USA

 Essence of : The 2009 Grayson Cabernet Sauvignon shows a dark violet color with deep, rich aromas of ripe, dark cherries, blackberries and hints of black pepper / This full bodied wine provides a round mouth feel with a long, lingering finish of hints of toasted French oak and a dry finish / I went through the whole bottle in one sitting, it’s THAT good. Really there many negative attributes for this wine and since its it’s only a 2009 vintage I wonder what it might be like in 2-3 years!

 Best Served With : Grilled&amp;Braised Meats, Tomato based Pastas and Pizza

 P rice Range: Under $12 per bottle

 Golden Duck 
 April 7th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is really good at Golden Duck Chinese restaurant in Kahala. The food comes out of the kitchen lightning fast so if you where planning a leisurely meal don’t order everything at once. The staff is very friendly,  attentive and make you feel welcome.

 Foo d: The food is good at Golden Duck. If you enjoy fresh seafood then we definitely recommend going to this Chinese restaurant because its taste and its cheap at only $13.95 for live lobster and $20.95 for live crab! The other items are OK but don’t stand out like the crab and lobster. Golden Duck has typical Chinese food including Peking Duck, Stir Fried Green Beans&amp;Pork, Noodles, Soups, Vegetables, and most likely anything you are craving / classic favorites.

 Favorite Dishes: Fresh lobster with black bean sauce, Fresh crab with ginger and onions, Choy Sum with oyster sauce, Fried string beans with pork (Tip: order rise instead of noodles they are a little oily and overcooked)

 Atmosphere : The ambiance isn’t anything exciting. The restaurant is big and has plenty of seating for all size parties which is great. The decor is very clean feeling because the wall and furniture are both bone white but they do have some plants and artwork which brighten it up a bit.

 Consistency: We have been twice so far and both times the fresh seafood was delicious! similarly the noodles dishes were not so great.

 Parking : One of the best things about Golden Duck is that it has tons of free parking located in the back of the restaurant.

 Price Range: Low-Medium ($11-$30) per Entree

 Fire Cracker Chipotle Corn on the Cob 
 March 21st, 2011 
 Serves: (4 people)

 Cooking Time: 24 minutes

 Ingredients:
 4 Fresh Sweet Corn, husk, Remove hair and wash
2 Pepper from a can of Embasa Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, Remove seeds from peppers and mince
3 Cloves of Garlic, Minced
2 Table Spoons Cilantro, Chopped
½ Teaspoon of Chili Powder
½ Teaspoon of Cumin
1 Stick of Salted Butter, Room temperature
Pinch of Salt and Black Pepper (to taste)
Heavy Duty Tin Foil

 Directions: 
 Preheat grill. Combined all ingredients excluding the corn into a bowl starting with the butter. The butter should be room temperature so soft to touch and easy to mix (if its not room temp place it into a microwavable safe bowl and heat it for 15-20 seconds). Stir the ingredients together until they are well mixed. Place each piece of corn individually onto a piece of tinfoil. Smear about 1 tablespoon of the firecracker butter onto each side of the corn and then tightly wrap the tinfoil around each piece of corn (like you would a burrito). Reserve the remainder of butter to spread on grilled corn. Place each piece of corn on the grill for 15-20 minutes with the lid down, stopping to turn the corn each 5 minutes to insure each side receives the desired chare. Remove the tin foil and spread on the remaining butter onto cooked corn. Serve with favorite BBQ entrée and surprise your friends with a new twist on a classic American dish this 4th of July.

 Root Beer Can Chicken 
 May 20th, 2011 
 Serves: 4 people

 Cooking Time: 3 1/2 Hours

 Ingredients :
1 (5-6 Pound) Whole Chicken
1 Can Root Beer
1 Gallon Size Heavy Duty Ziplock

 Marinate 
1 12 ounce Can Root Beer
½ Small White Sweet Onion, Chopped
½ Cup of Cilantro, (leaves and stems)
10 Cloves of Garlic
4 Tablespoons Ginger, Chopped
2 Tablespoon of Oyster Sauce
2 Teaspoon of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce
¼ cup Toasted Sesame Seed Oil
½ Cup Hoisin Sauce
½ Cup Aloha Soy Sauce (Low Sodium)
1 ½ Tablespoons of Chinese 5 Spice 

 Directions: 
Place all marinate ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. Remove neck and giblets from cavity of chicken and rinse it with cold water to remove any extra blood from the chicken. Place the chicken into a gallon size ziplock bag and add the marinate making sure to reserve 1 cup for basting later during grilling process. Place chicken into a large bowl and put into the refrigerator for two hours, turning the bag over after the first hour has past to insure it’s well marinated. Preheat grill to medium heat only one side of the gill (for indirect grilling). Open a root beer can, dump out half the contents and lower the chicken on to the open can, so that the chicken is sitting upright, with the can in its cavity. Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill, using the legs and beer can as a tripod to support the chicken on the grill and keep it stable. Cover and grill for 1 hour and 30 minutes, basting the chicken every 30 minutes with the remanding marinate. The total cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken, and the internal temperature of the grill. A 5 lb chicken will usually take around 1 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into a meaty portion and registers 160°F–165°F. If you don’t have a meat thermometer, a way to tell if the chicken is done is to poke it deeply with a knife (the thigh is a good place to do this), if the juices run clear, not pink, the chicken is done. Once complete using tongs carefully lift the chicken with a metal spatula under the bottom of the root beer can and place it onto a tray. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Carefully lift the chicken off of the can. If it gets stuck, lay the chicken on its side, and pull out the can with tongs. Complete the meal with your favorite side dishes.

 Top 5 Tips For Planning Your Next Party! 
 March 28th, 2011 
 Insider Tips for Hiring a Private Chef in Hawaii 

 1. Know Your Dinning Preference– The first step to having a great experience with a private chef in Hawaii is to understand what type of event you would like to have. This includes whether you not you would want to have a platted dinner, buffet style or only passed hor d’oeuvres. This effects the overall feel of the party and can set the tone for the event. Other preferences might include whether or not you would like to have a wine paring planned with your dinner or a themed party cocktail.

 2. Know Your Budget– Understanding your budget is important and sharing this information with your chef is crucial to ensuring your experience is enjoyable and stress free. When deciding on your budget you should take into consideration the costs of labor, food, beverages, rental equipment (this includes flatware, tables, tents, glasses, linens, etc), and state taxes. Calculating costs can be done based on a“per-head”cost or based on your reallocated savings. Speak to your private chef about your needs up front will help you feel in control and make sure everyone is on the same page.

 3. Pick A Theme– Picking a theme for your cuisine is key to having a cohesive party for your guests and setting your private chef on the right track. The theme should be consistent and can include menu, drinks,  decorations, and entertainment. Some great ideas for party themes are a Mexican Fiesta, Hawaiian Luau, A Night In Paris, Swedish Midsummer, Italian Pasta&amp;Pizza Party, Soul Food Slam, All-American BBQ, Chinese New Year, Easter Brunch, or even a group cooking class.

 4. Pick The Right Time - Depending on your theme and dinning preference picking the right time for your event can make a huge difference for your guests and your overall experience. If you are having a Pupu party you should plan the guests to arrive 30-40 minutes before the sun sets so they have time to enjoy the scenery but not so early that its blazing hot and the food integrity may be compromised. Similarly if you are hosting a baby shower luncheon you should plan for your guests to arrive at 11:30am and end at 1:30pm. Picking the right time is important to discuss with your private chef so they can plan for staffing and make sure all the food&amp;tables are set up and ready to go before the first guests arrive.

 5. Schedule A Face-To-Face Meeting– Finally schedule a face-to-face meeting with your private chef at your home so you can walk through the kitchen and your floor plans so the chef can get a first hand glimmer of your expectations and you can overcome any objections that may arise before the big day. Objections may include if you need rental equipment, extra power cords, where you want to set up the bartender, how many guests you want to have and the seating arrangements. Finally your private chef will want to view the kitchen appliances and accessories to make sure they don’t need to bring any extra pots, pans or equipment to execute your agreed upon menu.

 II Lupino Trattoria&amp;Wine Bar 
 April 19th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was average at ll Lupino in Waikiki. Both times we went to this restaurant the staff was friendly but very slow to respond to our needs. For example the first time we went the waiter never came back to fill up our wine glasses and we also asked for another menu to order additional items and he forgot twice (was missing in action for most of the meal). The other time we requested Parmesan cheese and peppers for our pizza and waited for over 10 minutes for the items to arrive (by the time we had eaten half our entrees) and the excuse was“we had to grade fresh Parmesan for you”well if its an Italian restaurant we would recommend doing that each day since its pretty probable someone will want it! Overall don’t go to this establishment if you are in a rush or not willing to wait for food, drinks and everything else you may want.

 Foo d: The food was good at II Lupino and is the new Italian restaurant from the chef / creator of  Wolfgang Steakhouse. The food was good but not each dish knocked our socks off by any means. The pasta was the most memorable of all the food and we can’t wait to go back and try some different ones from the menu. The salad was extremely boring and the first time we went we ordered the white pizza (with spinach and mushrooms)  which wasn’t our favorite, however, the last time we went our friend ordered one for the table and asked for them to drizzle some truffle oil over the top and it was 100% better. (NOTE: if you love prosciutto for $8 they will add fresh slices to any pizza).  They also have Happy Hour specials–Pizza’s for $10, Wine by the glass for $5, Beer $4 and snazzy cocktails for $7 between 3:00 pm – 6:30 pm daily so try it out after work for some Pau Hana with your friends.

 Favorite Dishes: Prosciutto Panini (for lunch), White Pizza (ask for truffle oil!) Linguine alle Vongole with(Linguine with Clams) served with White Wine, Ravioli all’Anatra (Slow-cooked Duck Ravioli with a Duck Ragu and Parmesan cheese) Yummy! Our recommendation just stick to the Pastas and you can’t go wrong. 
 

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is very nice at II Lupino Italian Restaurant. They have both ample indoor and outdoor seating both are extremely nice and have a causal yet elegant decor. The outdoor seating is lovely because it overlooks the Royal Hawaiian Gardens which are beautiful. The color scheme of the restaurant is a stunning yellow and black with rock walls creating a truly memorable dinning experience.

 Consistency: We have been twice so far and both times the pasta was delicious and the rest of the items where OK but certainly nothing to write home about. We haven’t been for breakfast or dinner thus far so will update this section after we experience it first hand.

 Parking : The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center has a parking lot (for cars under 6.2 feet tall) and II Lupino validates  so the parking is free for 3 hours after you eat which is nice if you wish to do a little shopping or take a stroll in Waikiki while in town.

 Tenyaku–Asian Yakiniku 
 April 13th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Tenyaku but not refined. The restaurant was very new (only a few months old) so hopefully they will smooth out the rough edges. The staff was friendly and very attentive the only thing we had to wait for our drinks for quite a while and the waiter didn’t bring all our dinner items at the same time (i.e. he forgot about our rice which came with the meal and we had to bring it up to him after all the meats, fishes and other items arrived also at different times) which made it harder to enjoy everything together.

 Food: The food was ok and they have typical Korean Yakiniku and Shabu-Shabu menu selections including some noodle and side dishes. Some items where pretty tasty but overall it lacked a little imagination and the wow factor that makes you want to return to a restaurant time and time again. One of the things we look for with a great Korean restaurants are vegetable/kimchi sides are very dynamic and tie the Yakiniku together. The sides where one of the best things on the menu, however, they only had three and it was kind of boring for the price tag attached to Korean BBQ meats. The bibimbap was also ok and did get nice and crunchy on the bottom but needed salt and some more pizazz overall. The best thing we had was the meat and they did cook ours in the back instead of making us do the Yakinkiu ourselves which is a nice option if you are not in the mood to BBQ yourself! so our advice is if you try this establishment go for Happy Hour either from 11am-3pm, 5pm-6:30pm,&amp;9pm-last call and get the 20% OFF meat options and keep it simple ( TIP : Don’t order the set menu for two people…. its a better deal to order off the menu and we only really liked 2 items we received)

 Favorite Dishes: The Premium Kalbi&amp;Kone Kalbi Short-Rib meat and Tofu soup where the best dishes. The vegetable side dishes were also good but they only had 3 dishes (Fish cake, Kimchi and Bean Sprouts) which is less than many other of the best Korean restaurants in town which offer 5+.

 Atmosphere : The restaurant was very clean and well taken care of which was great. The owner was also present which added to the ambiance and she even came over to ask us how our experience was going and thank us for coming. Tenyaku has a large inside with at least 20-25 tables. They also had a sushi bar so if you want to eat alone or not have Yakinku its a great option. The inside didnt have any memorable artwork or decor but cleanliness is always a very good asset.

 Consistency: We have only been once (and went because we got a Groupon) and to be quite honest don’t think we will try again. However, if we do go with some friends we promise to update this section and hopefully with some great news as we know what to order and what to stir clear from.

 Parking : Tenyaku Restaurant is located on Keeamoku and has about 8-10 free parking spots in front of the restaurant which is great but also share with the bar“Champions”located  next door. TIP –if you are planning to go for an early bird dinner and catch Happy Hour Tenyaku opens at 5pm so Champions is a good place to pop in for a drink while you wait (and you can park in the same lot!)

 Yakiniku Hiroshi 
 July 6th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was absolutely top notch at Yakiniku Hiroshi in Waikiki. They had about one server / table back per a table and it made a huge difference in the overall dinning experience. We didn’t have to wait even one minute for a refresh of our water/tea or to add other items to our order.  They also quickly removed old plates which is always appreciated.

 Foo d: The menu at Yakiniku Hiroshi comprises of a large variety of meats, seafood, noodles and a terrific assortment of vegetables. One of the best things about this restaurant is they have a very high standard of meat and only accept the top 1% of USDA graded beef. The best selections on the menu are Gold&amp;Platinum grades of Wayu Beef raised in Idaho and known as some of the best high quality American Kobe Style beef available.  The vegetable side dishes that came with the sample menu (for 2 people) where delicious and included choy sum, kim chee, diakon kim chee, bean sprouts, roasted garlic, rice, seaweed, and even a side salad. The food is good but its also very expensive for the amount of food you get for each dish so we recommending going with a big group so you can afford to try lots of items on the menu. They also have an excellent wine list with over 200 selections!
 Download Yakiniku Hiroshi Menu 

 Favorite Dishes: The Smaller Premium Sampler which was $45 per a person was great and if you prefer they will substitute the beef tongue for another meat variety fresh that day (we got a thinly sliced pork which was very yummy).

 Atmosphere : The ambiance was very nice at this establishment and they two seating areas downstairs (5 tables) and upstairs (10 tables). The tables are very clean and new-age for Yakninku and utilize a charcoal burning brazier which is smokeless and really enjoyable. The only thing we where not to keen on was the music which was very poppy and didn’t really mesh with the relaxing atmosphere.

 Consistency: We have only been once so far but would like to visit again soon.

 Parking : Yakiniku Hiroshi offers validated parking for 3 hours at the Waikiki Trade Center which is one block away from the restaurant.

 Sushi ii 
 May 22nd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was slow at Sushi ii but only because it was completely packed full of people. They only had one waitress but she was very nice and full of smiles. We also appreciated that as soon as we where seated she alerted us we wouldn’t receive any food for at least 35 minutes regardless if we ordered sushi or hot items which was just fine with us but nice to hear so you are prepared all the same!

 Foo d: The food was very good at Sushi ii. They have a full sushi bar as well as very interesting hot entree dishes like whole fried fresh fish (flounder, Moi or whatever is freshest), lots of protein&amp;seafood items including lamb, scallops, shrimp, oysters, sashimi carpaccio, and soft shell crab, as well as salads and unique desserts. You should have no problem finding something you will love at this restaurant and each dish has a unique twist making it memorable. Do keep in mind that most dishes are fried so its not a place to go while on a diet.

 Favorite Dishes: Fried Whole Moi (we ate everything but the spine bone!), Nori popovers with Furikake Butter (best popovers in town even over BLT and Mariposa they are interesting and unique), Ehu Carpaccio, Beet Salad, Mom’s Minoage (Shrimp wrapped in shoe thin potatoes and fried), Scallops, Sushi was also delicious. Banana dream pie dessert (light and fluffy) the only thing we didn’t like was the Soft Shell Crab as it was extremely overcooked…but seems like you can’t go wrong with anything on the menu!

 Atmosphere : We loved the ambiance at Sushi ii on Keeamoku street! The restaurant is very quaint and only has only about 6-7 tables inside in addition to the sushi bar. The walls are bright orange and it has good acoustics and although packed we where able to hear everyone at the table without yelling over loud music or neighbors conversations…..  it was very enjoyable!

 Consistency: We have only been once so far but have many friends who swear by Sushi ii and just rave about its consistence. We promise to update this section next time we go which is sure to be soon!!

 Parking : Sushi ii is located in the Samsung Plaza across the street from Walmart. They have free parking with validation. Otherwise you can usually find parking on the street or around the block next to Ross if they are completely full.

 Mai Tai’s Bar 
 May 30th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service is hit or miss at Mai Tai’s Bar in the Ala Moana Shopping Center but typically (during the day and early evening) its pretty good. Only when it gets late at night does it get a bit harder to get good service as it gets so packed. That being said, more than one time has our pizza come out cold or later than all the other dishes but whenever you complain they always are quick to rectify the mistake by getting you a replacement item fired ASAP and then taking the dish off your bill which is really excellent service and absolutely does make you feel alot better about the whole situation. The reason we think is because they share a kitchen with Forest Gump so the waiters have to travel a farther distance between retrieving the food and servicing the guests.

 Foo d: The food is good for typical bar food and they have a playful assortment of local favorites and standard bar items like seafood appetizers including popcorn&amp;coconut shrimp, ceviche, ahi, sliders, salads, sandwiches , and great flatbread pizzas on the menu. For a great deal on drinks and pupu’s you have two chances for Happy Hour everyday from 4pm-7pm and then again from 8pm-11pm. Happy Hour deals include $4 Martinis, Wine, on the Rocks $3-$8 Pitchers of Beer and $5 select appetizers 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Flatbread Pizzas, Avocado Spring Rolls, Sliders, and Edamame

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at Mai Tai’s is wonderful. They have the perfect outdoor but indoor seating and it really relaxing and a great place to enjoy the outdoors and beautiful Hawaii weather during the day and the night. The tables and decorations have a Tiki&amp;Hawaiiana theme and the waitresses all sport matching aloha wear outfits which brings the whole ambiance of the restaurant up a notch.

 Consistency: Mai Tai’s is pretty consistently good. As mentioned before they also have a tendency to bring out the food not completely hot so be prepared for that (and remember to send it back!). Other than that they have great food, a full bar and a consistently cool atmosphere to be enjoyed!

 Parking : Mai Tai’s has lots of free parking because it is located on the top floor of the Ala Moana Shopping Center making this a great place to meet after-work or anytime for some drinks and pupu’s with friends.

 SARENTO’S–At The Top Of The Ilikai 
 June 6th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The services started off really good at Sarento’s at the top of the Iliaki hotel with the wine sommelier who came right with our bred and wine list…. but after that it was down hill.  At first we thought they where trying to give us a“relaxed”experience when we waiting for 10-15 minutes before even receiving a menu but then once the meal started the same service inadequacies carried through. After we ate our entrees it took at least 20 minutes for them to clear our plates and even longer to receive a check which we eventually had to asked 3 different waiters for because we needed to get to a show on time and our waiter was MIA.

 Foo d: The food was very disappointing at Sarento’s! The menu looked really good but only 1 of the 4 things we ordered was very good. The menu is traditional Italian with lots of protein entrees and pastas but nothing was particularity mouth watering in fact, the seafood fra diavolio linguine pasta was a bit overcooked and the seafood it came with was pretty fishy. The stuffed pork chop was extremely dry (and it was stuffed with cheese so you would hope it would have a little moisture) and the best thing about ordering that dish was they brought my wife extra veggies on the side because she didn’t want the potatoes and they where really well cooked. Overall we ate the food because it was expensive and we where hungry but I would have been more satisfied eating at California Pizza Kitchen any day of the week. Another thing we feel compelled to mention is this pupu called the Ossa Bucco Potstickers which had a really strange and bitter taste&amp;even worst aftertaste…we only ate the filling so stay far away from that if you go!

 Favorite Dishes: The best thing we had besides the bread&amp;hummus they served on the table was the Ahi Bruchetta which was very fresh and with a little salt quite memorable, light and delicious.

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is the best thing going for Sarento’s and it has an unbeatable view over the ocean, diamond head and city of Honolulu. Each table has a unique view and really there is no bad seat in the establishment. One thing to mention is when we called to make our reservation they mentioned it was“Jazz night”and did we want to site in the Jazz section for an extra $10 cover charge. We declined the offer and then when we  were seated found ourselves smack dab right behind the wall where the Jazz was playing. The band was very talented but the music was so loud we had to scream to each other across the table! they should either start the live band after 9pm or keep it a bit down so its still background music for the guests (specially if you ask not to be in what they call the“Jazz Section”).

 Consistency: I would love to say we would be back to update this section but you couldn’t pay me enough money to give Sarento’s another shot in the near future. Maybe in a few years we will give it another whirl!

 Parking : Sarento’s has valet parking at the Ilikai which they validate for you so you only need to pay $2 (plus tip) or you can park in the self parking lot in the Marina Parking off Hobron also for $2 with validation.

 Luibueno’s 
 June 20th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was a bit slow at Luibueno’s in Haleiwa but since the restaurant is in the North Shore  I guess its more normal and we should cut them a little slack. They are a bit less“rushed”on the country side of the island so I guess its to be expected. The staff was very nice / friendly  and they did get our order right. The only really strange thing was you have to wait outside of the restaurant to be seated which was a little awkward.

 Foo d: The food was a traditional mix of Mexican&amp;Spanish. The menu consists of a large variety of Paellas, Ceviche, Salads, Soups, Burritos, Quesadillas, Entrees and of course TACOS! The menu has lots of fresh fish and seafood items which is nice to see specially since we are in Hawaii. The beans and rice could have used a little seasoning but the seafood was very fresh and well worth the price! They also offer Benuo Happy Hour deals on drinks and a lite menu selection everyday between 3-5pm&amp;9:30-10:30pm so try it out after work!

 Favorite Dishes: Fisherman’s Warf Tacos (without the white sauce) but we would recommend just ordering two taco’s ala cart instead of the plate because we where not to impressed with the rice&amp;beans.

 Atmosphere : We really enjoyed the atmosphere at Luibueno’s. It has a unique feel with wooden tables both facing the window on an upper level, interior seating on the lower level and bar seating. Each wall has very nice artwork and a good flow to the layout. The restaurant isn’t very big but they do a good job of positioning the tables so many people can be seated without feeling really crammed or like you are sitting on top of your neighbor. The high ceilings add a nice ambiance to the establishment and make it a pleasant place to have a drink or grab a bite with your friends or family.

 Consistency: This was the first time we have been to Luibueno’s because we got a Living Social coupon but we will update this section next time we visit which we are sure to because the fish tacos where just delicious.

 Parking : They have free parking at Luibeno’s outside in the Haleiwa town center shopping area.

 Home Bar&amp;Grill 
 July 16th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Home Bar&amp;Grill on Kalakaua ave. Both our servers where really nice, cute and really stayed on top of our groups service. Often times with a large group the service can be slow or some people’s dishes / drinks are not right but this was not the case with Home Bar&amp;Grill which was just great.

 Foo d: The food at Home Bar&amp;Grill is typical bar local style cuisine. Items you can expect to find on the menu include grilled meats, fries, poke, kim chee, salads, loco moco, burgers, seafood and even chicken gizzards. The menu also includes a Home Bar&amp;Grill Burger Challenge featuring three 8oz kulana burger patties with cheese, bacon, sauteed onions, mushrooms, fried egg and a pound of fries. If you can finish it in 15 minutes you get it for FREE. Its a fun local spot with good bar food variety and flavor-full food. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Pork Chop, Parmesan Truffle Fries, Garlic Soy Beans (edamame), and the tater tot nachos.

 Atmosphere : The restaurant is the old Slammers and they didn’t really do much to change the inside of the restaurant. It’s kind of run down looking with miss matched chairs and tables. The ambiance is dark and is the type of place you would meet some friends late night for grindz or maybe even a secret lover! haha

 Consistency: This was the first time we went but will update this section next time. We do have some friends who say its consistently good for drinks and pupu’s after work though!

 Parking : They have a valet parking private lot out front with a few limited spaces….or you can try to find street parking but be careful late at night because the area is a bit ghetto after dark.

 Blue Water Grill 
 July 11th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : Yikes…. the service was terrible at Blue Water Grill in Hawaii Kai. The evening started out with us calling and booking a reservation at 7:30pm that night. When we arrived we where informed that it would still be at least 30 minutes before we could be seated. I inquired why they didn’t tell us to come at 8pm if there where busy and the hostess was frazzled and didn’t really have an answer…hummmm get it together guys! Then once we where finally seated an hour later not only was the restaurant empty (like tables everywhere) but our waiter was less than impressive and kept forgetting things or was MIA for most of the evening.

 Foo d: The disappointments kept on coming when we received our food. By the time we where seated both the local fresh fishes dishes they where out of as well as the lamb. They blamed all the issues on the Groupon deal they did but we felt that they should have been more“on their game”knowing that their deal was expiring July 4th and that MAYBE this weekend people would come and use the GC before it expired!! The food was lack luster, under seasoned and overall pretty bad. The salmon came with mushy and overcooked rice, the ribs where dry and served over a watery slaw which made all the french fries wet, the Filet Mignon was cut into two thine pieces of meat (not a thick piece like it should be) and even our friends hamburger which is impossible to screw up wasn’t so great. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Seafood-Artichoke Dip, and our drinks.

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere is the best thing going for the Blue Water Grill. The restaurant is overlooking the water / harbor of Hawaii Kai and has a beautiful view. The is an ideal place to go for drinks and to watch the sunset. The decor is warm inside with high ceilings and light wood floor and fixtures.

 Consistency: We have only been once so far and will never go again. If we do for some strange reason we promise to update this section.

 Parking : Blue Water Grill has free parking out front if you are lucky enough to find a spot. The parking lot is in the Hawaii Kai shopping center and is shared with all the other restaurants&amp;vendors including Safeway, The Shack and many others.

 Yanagi Sushi 
 July 2nd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The staff was nice but not exactly helpful or very fast. In fact, it took over 20 minutes to get our credit card back which felt really strange when we paid. They did fill our water glasses quickly and clear old dishes but it wasn’t like they interacted with us. Typically if you notice a guest didnt eat more than one bit of a dish you would ask if they wanted something else of if anything was wrong with it. They just took it away and brought the check!

 Foo d: The food was very disappointing at Yanagi Sushi on Kapiolani blvd. This restaurant has been a stapil in Honolulu for years and has always had good Japanese food in the past. However, its been at least 5 years since we have been last and the food has really suffered during that time. Out of the 4 items we ordered only one was good or even eatable. The Pork Cutlet (Tonkatsu) was really chewy and cut into super large pieces making it very hard to eat. The shrimp tempura had a tiny thing little shrimp inside and so much batter on its all you could taste. Finally the chicken teriyaki was covered in fat and really grimly tasting. The only thing we even could eat was the butterfish (which was good) and the miso soup. Even the end of the experience was a bummer because the ice cream was very icy and overly sweet. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Butterfish Miso-yaki and Miso Soup

 Atmosphere : The ambiance is nice inside Yanagi Sushi but it is in need of a facelift. The tables are super old and the floor has seen better days. With a little work this place to be polished again. One nice attribute is that the walls showcase famous visitors and friends of the owners and make the restaurant quaint and have a unique family feel.

 Consistency: About 15 years ago this was a consistently good restaurant but after the experience we had today we wouldn’t go back for Japanese food ever. There are so many great restaurants like Imanas or Sushi ii you can go for the same price if not cheaper than Yanagi Sushi to have a delicious Japanese feast.

 Parking : Yanagi Sushi has valet parking out front which is convenient. All you need to do is pull up, pass over your keys and tip the boys a few dollars when you leave and you are all set!

 JJ Bistro&amp;French Pastry 
 July 18th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was less than impressive at JJ Bistro on Waialae Ave. The restaurant is family owned and the staff was friendly but very slow to take our order or bring us food. In fact, the items we ordered trickled in one at a time which was strange especially when you want to eat at the same time i.e. appetizers and then entrees together, as a table.

 Foo d: wow the food was bad at JJ’s and overall very lack luster. Everything was eatable but we only ate it because where so hungry…. practically starving! We started with the Kang Lao soup which was in a beautiful bowl but very watery and needed a bit more thickness or flavor to it, followed by the pizza which was so oily the whole bottom of the plate was covered in it. The pizza tasted ok but nothing better than we could have ordered from Dominos! The next dish we received was the vegetarian quiche which was by far the most disappointing dish specially for a french bistro! I mean how hard is it to make a quiche? it was just terrible. The last dish we received was the baked opakapaka and although it wasn’t fishy the sauce was extremely watery and had a strange flavor. We def wouldn’t return to JJ’s unless we where sticking to desserts because they looked pretty good. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: None….. bummer

 Atmosphere : Ummm the atmosphere was very strange at JJ’s. The artwork is a mix match of all kinds of stuff and really quirky overall. Also the walls where really dirty which was a bit gross to look at while trying to enjoy your meal.

 Consistency: It was the first time we have been and most likely the last! we went because we had a Groupon and thought it would be fun to give it a try but wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.

 Parking : JJ Bistro has a small parking lot behind the restaurant with some stalls for guests. On the weekend you can also park in the other retailers space because they are closed for the weekend. Besides the parking lot you can try to find street parking which is metered.

 Price Range: Low ($5-$9.95) per Entree (Prix menu–$24.70)
No Corkage Fee!

 Café Kaila 
 July 18th, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was good at Cafe Kaila in the Market City Shopping Center. The place was totally packed for lunch and we had to wait for a table / counter space to free up but the staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure the got my wife’s custom order right which was really great. They also brought out waffle samples to the hungry and waiting customers out side the store which where delicious and crispy.

 Foo d: The food was really good at Cafe Kaila! They serve breakfast all day which is always a winner and lunch starting at 11am. Items you can expect to find on the menu include fluffy omelets, egg scrambles, waffles, pancakes, salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas and some other lovely entree’s. The food was very fresh and tasted great. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Egg white omelet with smoked salmon, onion, capers and cream cheese (ask for the Lox Scramble as an egg white omelet and add the cheese), Lox Scramble also good, and the chicken avocado salad was great.

 Atmosphere : Cafe Kaila is lovely inside. It’s a very quant restaurant with a light wood and a pleasant ambiance. The artwork is of french&amp;italian paintings of scenic sites and nature. Overall the atmosphere is very nice and since the establishment isn’t to large its not very loud even when every table&amp;counter space seat is filled. The restaurant is very popular so be prepared to wait 20 minutes for a table if you go during the high peek lunch hour or early for breakfast…

 Consistency: Every time we have been so far it has been consistently delicious AND great service! we feel very good about this restaurants prospects and come on who doesn’t love breakfast all day? or at least until 3pm!

 Parking : Cafe Kaila is located in the Market City Shopping Center on Kapiolani blvd (at the end) in the same area as the Foodland and next to the Fun Factory. The shopping area has limited parking which is shared with all the stores / restaurants but if you are patient or lucky you can always find a spot unless you go on a weekend in which case it can be more challenging.

 Uncle Bo’s 
 August 3rd, 2011 
 Overall Review: 

 Service : The service was really excellent at Uncle Bo’s on Kapahulu. The waitress was a real pro, full of smiles and very candid. She was on top of her game and didnt miss a beat from the moment we sat down till the moment we paid the check. In fact, we had a coupon and forgot to read the fine print indicating we had to come after 8pm she spoke to the manager on our behalf (so we could redeem our voucher) and we really appreciated all her help and attentiveness. The only not so memorable in a good way service was the hostess who tried to seat us in the back room because we didnt have a reservation. The restaurant had plenty of empty tables out front so it was a bit particular that we had to ask a few times not to site in the dark, cold back of the restaurant especially when arriving for dinner so early at 6:30pm. The manager finally interviewned and told her she could seat in front with everyone else! ha ha ha

 Foo d: The food was not so great at Uncle Bo’s its average but nothing really stands out as delicious or memorable which you look for from a restaurant and keeps you coming back time and time again. Everything we ordered was very overly sweet including the Baby Back Ribs, Clams and Pork Kabobs. You can find a good assortment of pupu’s, pastas, pizzas, seafood&amp;poltry entrees at Uncle Bo’s with a asian-pacific meets italian theme to it. We also ordered a“Crab  Salad with Avocado”but where disappointed when it only had 3 small little pieces of crab a few pieces of avocado and the rest was all ham and a traditional cob salad. It was very boring and miss marketed for sure. The best thing we ordered was the Spicy Tuna Wraps, they where creamy and very tastily but not even remotely spicy. 
 

 Favorite Dishes: Spicy Tuna Wraps

 Atmosphere : The atmosphere at Uncle Bo’s is nice. The restaurant has high ceilings and interesting artwork. The restaurant used to be Anti pastas so one wall has some interesting stanglass windows with garlic and other italian themed pictures covering it. The feel is trendy especially with the dark walls, floor and hanging chains. The front of the restaurant is lovely, however, the back of the restaurant has a completely different ambiance with low ceilings and rather dark / constricted. Our recommendation is to make a reservation and request the front seating area or go another time. The bar only has about 4-5 stools so its more of a place to mingle while waiting for a table than to grab a quick bite.

 Consistency: We go to Uncle Bo’s every once and a while but it has been about a year since the last time we went. We are not particular impressed any time we have been with the food but it was convenient with the kapahulu location and late hours to grab pupus with friends, however, now that the new Side Street opened down the street i’m sure we will not be back to Uncle Bo’s for a good  long while (the pork chop at side street is to die for!).

 Parking : Uncle Bo’s does not have free parking but there is a small private parking lot right next to the restaurant which costs $5 or you can find metered street parking which is free after 6pm and usually pretty easy to come by at night. If you have troubles across the street is another paid parking lot with ample spots as well.

 Oven Roasted Vegetables with Prosciutto Crisps 
 August 8th, 2011 
 Serves: 2-4 People
 Cooking Time: 45 minutes

 Ingredients: 
1 Head of Broccoli, Wash, Cut into smaller pieces about 2 inches
3 Large Carrots, Peeled, Cut into 2 inch pieces
1Large  Kabocha Squash, Cleaned, Cubed (leave peel on)
1 White Onion, Cut into 2 inch pieces
4-6 Pieces of Prosciutto
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Salt&amp;Pepper

 Directions: 
Preheat the oven to 425° degrees. Get out a large cooking sheet and cover with heavy duty tin foil. Place all the vegetables onto the sheet and season generously with salt&amp;pepper. Next take some extra virgin olive oil and drizzle on top of the vegetables. With your hands mix the vegetables together so the olive oil is distributed throughout them evenly. Next take out the strips of prosciutto and place them on top of the vegetables. Place into the oven and cook for 45 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked to desired level and prosciutto crisps are crispy. Serve as dinner with some brown rice or along with a protein as a side dish. This dish is great for any vegetables you have left over in the refrigerator!
