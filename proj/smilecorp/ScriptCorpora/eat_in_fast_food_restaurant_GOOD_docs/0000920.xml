 The West End is a very unique neighborhood and so it is not surprising that our residents are an interesting mix of individuals. We are fortunate to have many creative folks- artists, performers, tinkerers and the like. In fact, a West Ender is not all that surprised to see a handmade human powered vehicle or even a marching band on our streets. Pretty cool, eh? We will now boast about a few: 

 June- 2nd&amp;3rd; 9&amp;10th- West End Artist, Bob Ankers is featured in the 18th annual Art at the Source Tour .

 Church Marching Band - Yes, there is a marching band headquartered right in the West End! Bocce attendees were entertained last Friday by the Church Marching Band. The band members were on their way to Seattle’s HONK! Fest West- a free, three-day, community-supported music festival devoted to marching bands, drum corps, samba lines, and anything acoustic and mobile that makes a ruckus. See what you miss when you don’t make it to Bocce?
