It&apos;s a Chic Fil-A. I only ever get the nuggets. They have them, AND fresh-brewed iced tea. That&apos;s enough.

The line at this Express cafeteria-style location always moves quickly so don&apos;t let a crowd scare you away. But what am I saying? People who love Chic Fil-A don&apos;t let a little thing like a line get in their way.

What&apos;s everyone&apos;s deal with Chic Fil-A? Let me briefly explain my personal addiction: My mom hated fast food, but often made an exception for the Chic Fil-A in our Midwest hometown mall. When I was about 5 years old, we lost our Chic Fil-A. And then there were NO more Chic Fil-As in the Midwest. My entire hometown suffers from the same Chic Fil-A withdrawals. I&apos;m not necessarily proud, but I don&apos;t think I will ever get tired of this stuff (though I&apos;m all about the Polynesian sauce, and can take or leave the waffle fries). There.

What I had?  Spicy Chicken Sandwich (A boneless breast of chicken seasoned with a spicy blend of peppers, hand-breaded, pressure cooked in 100% refined peanut oil and served on a toasted, buttered bun with dill pickle chips), coleslaw, and cheesecake

Food review:  Let&apos;s see here.. I got a spicy chicken sandwich which was barely spicy and maybe a little undercooked.  :-s  So that was a little dissapointing but the coleslaw was generally tasty and so was the cheesecake.  Overall, a so-so experience.

Service? No complaints

Other thoughts:  This is a Chic-fil-a Express.  It&apos;s just about convenience and it&apos;s decent for being convenient.

LOVE Chick Fil A. BUT - soggy waffle fries :( maybe it was just me since all other reviews seem overwhelmingly positive. Probably because they heat it under a heat lamp...yikes! Who knows how long that&apos;s been there and who touched it before you.

Also, you have to ASK for all the sauces (they seem reluctant to give it out?)

This is seriously the best fast food restaurant around. I love Chik Fil A and it really doesn&apos;t matter on the location. Save a cow, eat more chicken, and get it from these guys. There is a reason there is always a line around the corner when I go. Just don&apos;t get a craving for them on a Sunday, they aren&apos;t open.

I feel kinda dirty giving a fast food restaurant five stars but Chick Fil A really is my favorite chain. The simplicity of the chicken sandwich and cross cut fries with BBQ sauce and ranch for dipping just can&apos;t be beat.

I just had one of their shakes for the first time the other day and it was stupendous. If you have the mean I highly recommend picking one up.

It seems like this particular chick fil a is hidden for the people that work or live downtown ( I hate that because I don&apos;t work downtown just live 4 blocks away from it ).

However , service is pretty good and faster .

Staff is always friendly and nice.

Unfortunately , this is just open for a few hours and closed during the weekend .

Lol :-p

Coming from vegas there is no Chick-Fil-A. So when I am in a state that offers it, i&apos;m on a mission-heck it&apos;s like a drug to me. So I woke up at 6am( i am not a morning person) to get ready and walk downtown to have chick-fil-a for breakfast. Boy was I pissed when I got here, they don&apos;t serve breakfast and they didn&apos;t open until 10:30am. So I head back to my hotel to take a short nap before my first meeting. Didn&apos;t make it back for lunch, so the next day I left my meeting early so I could get there at noon. Boy it was worth it and yes I brought extra for later that evening. I think they need to  rent another building  downtown and be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. i&apos;m sure they will make more money.

*Yes, what is up with giving checkers(rally burger restaurant) ketchup package, I don&apos;t think Samuel Truett Cathy would like that. Besides all the other Chick-Fil-A&apos;s are using the new heinz package. Stop being cheap.

Its actually a Chick-Fil-A EXPRESS - meaning you serve yourself.

They have sandwiches, nuggets, salads&amp;fries all pre-made and you grab what you want and pay.  This is OK, but then you really don&apos;t know how long it has been under the light (although it is so busy at lunch I am guessing not long).  Still if I need a chicken nugget fix, I go to Chick-fil-a!  And this one is as advertised - express.

There is free wi-fi in the seating area and they usually have someone walking around asking if you want mints and busing tables - so it isn&apos;t too bad for fast food!

This location is a Chick-fil-A &quot;express&quot; which means you pick up your delicious chicken sandwiches and waffle fries cafeteria-style. So you actually get your food pretty damn fast!

The downside? This location is only open weekdays from 10:30am - 2:30pm.

They&apos;ve made the process a little better. Previously, you had to bag your own stuff and usually ended up being in the way of other patrons. Now the cashier is bagging your stuff which makes the line run a bit smoother.

They still experience major delays due to running out of chicken strips and fries (you&apos;d think they would have the supply thing down by now) but it&apos;s still yummy.

Ok ok.....so before I moved to Denver, I never had the experience of Chick Fil-A, but you know, I , being particular as I am, do notice a difference in how delicious they are.

So considering I&apos;ve moved closer to town (which I love) there are no Chick-Fil-A&apos;s - - that is- until I found out about this magical place!

So, yes, it is Chick-Fil-A Express (you grab your own food) -kinda strange at first- but still delicious nonetheless!

Its a hidden gem for those that work downtown or live close to downtown.

Corporate Chikn Factory this isn&apos;t even a full blown Chick-Fil-A its a walk through line! Its gets busy and backed up but they keep pumping out these white bagged delectable treats! McD&apos;s try&apos;s to duplicate but cant touch what Chick-Fil-A has mastered!

Also they have perfected a diet lemonade that actually is pretty damn tasty, Secret is splenda lots of it I am guessing! Actually its not a secret cause the darn splenda logo is right there on the lemonade dispenser!

I get all Plankton here and want to steal the secret to the Krabby Patty so I can figure out how to make these chicken breasts at home!

This place also invokes the condiment pack rat in me I always test them and instead of sneaking extra sauces I put them right there on the tray! Not once have I heard sir 5 BBQ sauces, 3 Ranches and 6 packs of Hot Sauce are entirely to much to go with your 5 packs or Ketchup and 3 Mayonnaises for your single sandwich and fries!

This place is located in the food court of Republic Plaza and is only open until 2:30 because it is quote a express location!

Bonus pts though as you walk out the rotating doors you are hit with the wonderfic smells of the Santa Fe Cookie Company!

I usually love everything here.
SInce I don&apos;t get to eat at a Chick-Fil-A often since I only know of one in CA.

But this time around I ordered the chicken nuggets.  They were so pinner and small.  I should have gotten the 8 pieces.  But otherwise it was delish!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Chicken, and more chicken.  Oh, fries and a drink.  This is the short menu version of Chick-Fil-A in the Republic Plaza on the 16th Street Mall downtown.  Not my first choice for lunch, but sometimes you just hit a brick wall of ideas and nothing sounds good, yet still, I need to eat lunch.  The most obvious thing missing from the menu is, naturally, the one thing I specifically like about Chick-Fil-A and that would be the chicken salad sandwich.  Sad really.  Oh well, my real food choices in this court are just across the way, so I only have myself to blame.  I won&apos;t be rude and mention them in a review for another business but suffice it to say one&apos;s a salad joint, one&apos;s Chinese food.  Hint, hint.

One note, this location usually has a long line, so plan on a wait if you hit it up right at noon.  Or try something else.  Hint, hint.

I worked downtown for probably 2 years before I realized there was a Chick-Fil-A in the food court downstairs in the Republic Plaza.

Man, I love that place. And this is a cool location, they just make chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, those chicken nuggets and some pre-made salads and it&apos;s serve yourself style. You grab what you want and pay. Even with this extremely efficient service style and 2 cashiers this place will have a line 30 feet long usually.

Once again the Republic Plaza Food court saves the day!
Got there right at noon...line wasn&apos;t very long, and moves really quick.
I was back to my office stuffing my face full of waffle fry&apos;s and chicken in No time! It was even time to re-stock up on condiments...hot sauce, honey mustard, ranch, etc.
ahhh.... nice and full...and still have drinkin money for the weekend! :-)

Like a previous poster, I worked downtown for years (since 1998) before I ever knew that the Republic Plaza Food Court existed. I was ecstatic when I found out they had a Chick-Fil-A down there (which, in my head, I always pronounce &quot;Chick-Fil-Uh&quot;...you can&apos;t changes the laws of pronunciation midway through a word!)

This location is a little bit like those self-service restaurants you find in airports or hospitals. The food is usually  kept warm and fresh, though. it seems every time I go there, I have to wait for a chicken sandwich to come out of the oven. So their stuff doesn&apos;t seem to linger under the heat lamps for long. Their waffle fries are severely underrated and quite tasty.

They have a limited menu and you can&apos;t see the combo meals until you get to the register. But you can grab a heapin&apos; load of dipping&apos; sauce and free drink refills. Overall, you can get a good lunch for about 6 bucks.

For credit card users: they only accept MasterCard and Visa

The food court itself is an okay place to spend your lunch hour. Cleaned often as people cycle through constantly. I&apos;ll grab a copy of the Onion, Westword or the Denver Daily News, find myself a table, eat some Chick-Fil-A and I&apos;m good for an hour!

There is one creepy Ben Franklin-lookin&apos; dude who frequents the place on a seemingly daily basis. I usually see him around the 1pm mark, seated at a table in front of the Chick-Fil-A line. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a nice guy... just looks kinda&apos; creepy and it&apos;s funny that I see him EVERY time I&apos;m there.

I am happy with any Chick-Fil-A. When most people visit a new city or country they immerse themselves in the local culture. Eating at the local restaurants in an effort to assimilate themselves. Well I did just that in downtown Denver.

This Express location is located in the bottom level of a shopping center, and resembles many of the food courts across America. Line was long for any of my previous Chick-Fil-A experiences. But it moved at a decent pace given its immense popularity. You end up grabbing all the items you want. A 12-piece here, a sandwich there, some cole slaw over here, and how about ten Polynesian sauces.

The express location will leave a dent in your wallet since you do not have the glowing combo meal board to choose from immediately. And the lemonade as always was the best part. Free refills!

I can not tell you  how much I love Chick-Fil-A! It&apos;s beyond measure, really. This one is downstairs in a foodcourt off 16th Street mall, you pretty much have to know where it is to get there. Nevertheless, if you don&apos;t get there early you WILL wait in line. But don&apos;t worry, the line moves quick and ensures that your chicken nuggets and waffle fries (yum!) will be piping hot and fresh. And don&apos;t forget the lemonade!
