 The Evolution of Fast Food Logos 
 By Miss Cellania in Neatorama Exclusives on Aug 25, 2010 at 7:05 am 
International symbols for successful brands don’t change a lot, but they do change. The point of a fast food logo is to make a known brand recognizable at a distance for those who are new to the neighborhood. Here are the histories of some restaurant logos you’ll recognize anywhere.

McDonalds

 

 

Dick and Mac McDonald made a good living selling 15 cent hamburgers in California in the 1940s. They began to branch out in the 1950s, and wanted a distinctive look for the franchised hamburger stands. A building design by architect Stanley Clark Meston incorporated several of Dick McDonald’s ideas, including the two golden arches that framed the building. Meston hated the idea, until years later when McDonalds became an American icon. The first such building went up in Phoenix, Arizona in 1953. Many buildings also used one golden arch to support the sign out front. As more McDonalds opened, the arches became recognizable to travelers all over the country. Meanwhile, the McDonald’s symbol was a chef named SpeeDee until he was officially replaced as a logo in 1962 and as mascot by Ronald McDonald in 1967. Speedee was nice, but it was the arches that everyone recognized. In 1962 Jim Schindler, the head of engineering and design for the company, sketched a logo that incorporated both the arches and the buildings’slanted roof. The genius of the design was that the arches formed an“M”. The simplified modern double arch design was trademarked in 1968 and is still in use today.

Burger King

 

The Burger King chain began in 1954 in Miami as an Insta Burger King outlet. James McLamore and David R. Edgerton, Jr. changed some Insta Burger King ideas and added some of their own, such as the flame-broiling that became Burger King’s signature technique. The logo was developed in 1967 to resemble a hamburger, with bun halves surrounding the name. It was in use chain-wide by 1969 . The design was updated in 1994 to add a blue swirl to the now slightly-tilted burger.

KFC

 

Kentucky Fried Chicken has always included its founder Colonel Harland Sanders in its logo. Sanders was a restauranteur since 1930 and franchised his chicken recipe in 1952. The original logo design was created by consultants Lippincott and Margulies in 1952 and updated in 1978. Schechter and Luth created the red logo in 1991 , with the chain name shortened in order to get away from the connotations of the word“fried”. The 1997 update by Landor put a smile on the Colonel’s face. Tesser redrew the Colonel again for the 2006 logo , which put the Colonel in the kitchen, so to speak, as he is now wearing an apron. He’s also noticeably slimmer than he ever was in real life.

Taco Bell

 

Glen Bell opened the first Taco Bell restaurant in 1962 as a spin-off of his Taco-Tia restaurants in California. The first franchise logo resembled someone asleep wearing a sombrero . PepsiCo bought Taco Bell in 1978 and immediately replaced the logo with a simpler and less controversial bell symbol. The even simpler purple and pink logo was introduced in 1995 , inspired by the color treatment of the logo as it appeared in the 1993 movie Demolition Man .

Old Burger King logo was better, sometimes they stylize the soul right out of the logo.

Landor didn’t re-do Colonel in 2006, Tesser did.

Thanks, Tesserite! It seems my source link is wrong, and after a look around, I will change that.

I was down in Stuart, FL last weekend and they have an old McDonalds just like the one in the photo above. I thought it was pretty cool.

You guys shouldn’t really say“in the neighborhood”. Fast food places are generally in strip malls, NOT neighborhoods!

I just wonder how they ever got away with called the Colonel’s recipe“Kentucky Fried Chicken”when, to my knowledge, it has always has been pressure-cooked.

And as for the“11 secret herbs and spices”, three of them are nothing more secret than salt, pepper, and MSG.

I agree Splint, the old Burger King logo at least looked like a hamburger. The new one…ugh.

The new Burger King logo is an example of why ad agencies shouldn’t be allowed to use Photoshop.

Also it was changed in 1999, not 1994.

I find that the restaurant logo really does affect how my food tastes. BK made two horrible decisions in the past two decades: one was the logo change, and the other was the french fries.

Taco bell, go back to the older logo. Your tacos will taste better.

If I remember correctly, Burger King’s original logo was a smiling cartoon king sitting on top of a large hamburger.
 http://www.retroplanet.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/Burger_King_Cup.jpg 

My father worked as a machine designer at the company that had the regional (in New England) account to supply paper cups and lids to BK.

He used to say that a graphic artist at his company came up with the famous logo of the“Burger King”name inside a bun, and shared it with BK; but BK took the logo without crediting the artist. That was a long time ago, and unfortunately the artist has passed away; but he was never bitter about it-–would just shrug his shoulders.
