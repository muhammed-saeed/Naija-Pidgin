Levels (DN3D)
 Edit 
 History 
 
The levels of Duke Nukem 3D take the player outdoors through rendered street scenes, military bases, deserts, flooded cities, space stations, moon bases and even Japanese villas. Many of the levels have a fairly non-linear design that allows players to thoroughly explore the levels a number of different ways and let them discover many secret areas. The non-linearity of the levels also allows them to be easily used in multiplayer games.

The levels of the game are the result of a number of people&apos;s work. The initials next to each level denotes who primarily created that level. (Information from DUKELVLS.TXT .)

 AB - Allen H Blum III LL - Richard Bailey Gray (The Levelord) RP - Randall Pitchford II KS - Keith Schuler GB - George Broussard

 Episode 1 - L.A. Meltdown Edit

 Episode 2 - Lunar Apocalypse Edit

 Episode 3 - Shrapnel City Edit 

 Duke arrives back on Earth and ventures through several unrelated locations, including a bank, a movie set, a subway and a hotel, before ending up in a football stadium opposing the Cycloid Emperor .

 LL - Raw Meat LL - Bank Roll LL - Flood Zone LL - L.A. Rumble LL - Movie Set (has secret exit to &quot;Tier Drops&quot;) LL - Rabid Transit LL - Fahrenheit LL - Hotel Hell (has secret exit to &quot;Freeway&quot;) AB - Stadium LL - Tier Drops (secret level) AB - Freeway (secret level) 

Note: Shrapnel City was also the name of the first episode of the original Duke Nukem game.




 Episode 4 - The Birth Edit 

Secret footage shows a woman giving birth to the Alien Queen , surrounded by a herd of not-before-seen aliens . After seeing this, Duke sets off from the secret missions facility, through a fast food restaurant, a theme park and a post office, towards an alien spaceship and the Alien Queen .

 Note: Although the creator information for Going Postal is not present in DUKELVLS.TXT, opening the map in BUILD reveals the creator&apos;s initials (AHB = Allen H Blum) in the lower right corner. These initials are also present in other maps created by Allen. 

 Demo levels Edit 

The following maps are extra levels that come with the game, and show examples of various effects and sprites. They are not meant to be played in.
