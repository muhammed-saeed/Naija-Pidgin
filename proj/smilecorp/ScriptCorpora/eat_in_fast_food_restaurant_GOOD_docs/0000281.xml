The average number of items in the typical woman&apos;s bathroom is 337.

13. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY

Any married man should forget his mistakes. There&apos;s no use in two people
remembering the same thing.
 
A couple drove down a country road for several miles, not saying a word.
An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither of them wanted
to concede their position. As they passed a barnyard of mules, jack
asses, and pigs, the husband asked sarcastically,&quot;Relatives of yours?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot;the wife replied,&quot;in-laws.&quot;
 
A woman was out golfing one day when she hit her ball into the
woods. She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.

The frog said to her,&quot;If you release me from this trap, I
will grant you three wishes.&quot;

The woman freed the frog and the frog said,&quot;Thank you, but
I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes 
that what ever you wish for, your husband will get 10 times more or better!&quot;

The woman said,&quot;That would be okay,&quot;and for her
first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her,&quot;You do realize that this wish will
also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis, that women will flock too.&quot;

The woman replied,&quot;That will be okay because I will be the
most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes for me.&quot;

So, KAZAM - she&apos;s the most beautiful woman in the world! For her
second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said,&quot;That will make your husband the richest man
in the world and he will be ten times richer than you.&quot;

The woman said,&quot;That will be okay because what is mine is
his and what is his is mine.&quot;

So, KAZAM she&apos;s the richest woman in the world!

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered,&quot;I&apos;d like a mild heart attack.&quot;

Moral of the story: Women are clever bitches. Don&apos;t mess with them.
 
A very attractive woman goes up to the bar in a quiet rural pub.
She gestures alluringly to the bartender, who comes over immediately. When he
arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face closer to hers.
When he does so, she begins to gently caress his full beard.&quot;Are you the
manager?&quot;she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands.

&quot;Actually, no&quot;the man replies.&quot;Can you get him
for me?&quot;she asks.&quot;I need to speak to him,&quot;she says, running
her hands beyond his beard and into his hair.&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t&quot;,
breathes the bartender.&quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;Yes, there is. I need you to give him a message&quot;she
continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him
to suck them gently.&quot;What should I tell him?&quot;the bartender manages to say.

&quot;Tell him&quot;, she whispers,&quot;There is no toilet
paper or hand soap in the ladies toilet&quot;.
 
 Post Christmas Diet 

&apos;Twas the month after
Christmas, and all through the house
Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse.
The cookies I&apos;d nibbled, the eggnog I&apos;d taste
At the holiday parties had gone to my waist.
When I got on the scales there arose such a number!
When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber).
I&apos;d remember the marvelous meals I&apos;d prepared;
The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared,
The wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese
And the way I&apos;d never said,&quot;No thank you, please.&quot;
As I dressed myself in my husband&apos;s old shirt
And prepared once again to do battle with dirt.
I said to myself, as I only can&quot;You can&apos;t spend a winter disguised as a man!&quot;
So--away with the last of the sour cream dip,
Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip
Every last bit of food that I like must be banished
Till all the additional ounces have vanished.
I won&apos;t have a cookie--not even a lick.
I&apos;ll want only to chew on a long celery stick.
I won&apos;t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie,
I&apos;ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry.
I&apos;m hungry, I&apos;m lonesome, and life is a bore,
But isn&apos;t that what January is for?
Unable to giggle, no longer a riot.
Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet!

A woman was walking along the beach when she 
stumbled upon a Genie&apos;s lamp.

She picked it up and rubbed it, and 
lo-and-behold a Genie appeared. The amazed woman asked if she got three wishes.

The Genie said,&quot;Nope ... due to inflation, constant downsizing, low
wages in third-world countries, and fierce global competition, I can only
grant you one wish. So...what&apos;ll it be?&quot;

The woman didn&apos;t hesitate. She said,&quot;I want peace in the Middle East. See this
map? I want these countries to stop fighting with each other.&quot;

The Genie looked at the map and exclaimed,&quot;Gadzooks, lady! These
countries have been at war for thousands of years. I&apos;m good but not THAT
good! I don&apos;t think it can be done. Make another wish.&quot;

The woman thought for a minute and said,&quot;Well, I&apos;ve never been able to find
the right man. You know, one that&apos;s considerate and fun, likes to cook and
helps with the housecleaning, is good in bed and gets along with my family,
doesn&apos;t watch sports all the time, and is faithful. That&apos;s what I wish for... a good mate.&quot;

The Genie let out a long sigh and said,&quot;Let me see that f****n&apos; map!&quot;

 Woman&apos;s dictionary 

1. &quot;Fine&quot;
This is the word women use at the end of any argument when they
feel they are right but can&apos;t stand to hear you argue any longer. It means that
you should shut up. (NEVER use&quot;fine&quot;to describe how she looks. This
will cause you to have one of those arguments.)

2. &quot;Five minutes&quot;
This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your
football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so women feel that
it&apos;s an even trade.

3. &quot;Nothing&quot;
Nothing&quot;means something and you should be on your toes.&quot;Nothing&quot;is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of
wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards.&quot;Nothing&quot;usually signifies an argument that will last&quot;Five Minutes&quot;and end
with the word&quot;Fine.&quot;

4. &quot;Go Ahead&quot;(with raised eyebrows)
This is NOT permission; it&apos;s a dare! If you mistake it for permission,
the result will be the woman will get upset over&quot;Nothing&quot;and you&apos;ll
have a&quot;five-minute&quot;discussion that will end with the word&quot;Fine.&quot;

5. &quot;Go Ahead&quot;(normal eyebrows)
This is NOT permission, either. It means&quot;I give up&quot;or&quot;do
what you want because I don&apos;t care.&quot;You will get a raised eyebrow&quot;Go
Ahead&quot;in just a few minutes, followed by&quot;Nothing&quot;and&quot;Fine&quot;and she will talk to you in about&quot;Five
Minutes&quot;when she cools off.

6. &quot;Loud Sigh&quot;
This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement. Very
frequently misunderstood by men. A&quot;Loud Sigh&quot;means she thinks
you are a complete idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here
and arguing with you over&quot;Nothing!.&quot;

7. &quot;Soft Sigh&quot;
Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.&quot;Soft Sighs&quot;are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. It means she is
momentarily content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe in the hope
that the moment will last a bit longer.

8. &quot;Oh&quot;
This word -- followed by any statement - is trouble. Example;&quot;Oh, let
me get that&quot;. Or,&quot;Oh, I talked to him about what you were doing
last night.&quot;If she says&quot;Oh&quot;before a statement,
run, do not walk, to the nearest exit. She will tell you that she is&quot;Fine&quot;when she is done tossing your clothes out the window, but do
not expect her to talk to you for at least two days. (&quot;Oh&quot;as the lead to a sentence usually signifies that you are caught in a lie).
Do not try to lie more to get out of it, or you will get a raised eyebrow&quot;Go ahead,&quot;sometimes followed by acts so unspeakable that I can&apos;t
bring myself to write about them.

9. &quot;That&apos;s Okay&quot;
This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man.&quot;That&apos;s Okay&quot;means that she wants to think long and hard before
deciding what the penalty will be for whatever you have done.&quot;That&apos;s
Okay&quot;is often used with the word&quot;Fine&quot;and in conjunction with
a raised eyebrow&quot;Go Ahead.&quot;Once she has had time to plan it out, you
are in for some mighty big trouble.

10. &quot;Please Do&quot;
This is not a statement, it is an offer. The woman is giving you the
chance to come up with an excuse for what you have done. In other words, a
chance to get yourself into even more trouble. If you handle this
correctly, you shouldn&apos;t get a&quot;That&apos;s Okay.&quot;

11. &quot;Thanks&quot;
The woman is thanking you. Don&apos;t faint and don&apos;t look for hidden meaning.
Just say&quot;you&apos;re welcome.&quot;

12. &quot;Thanks A Lot&quot;
&quot;Thanks A Lot&quot;is dramatically different from&quot;Thanks.&quot;A
woman will say&quot;Thanks A Lot&quot;when she is really ticked off at you.
It is usually followed by the&quot;Loud Sigh.&quot;This signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way. Be careful not to ask what is wrong
after the&quot;Loud Sigh,&quot;as she will only tell you&quot;Nothing&quot;.

 Things It Takes a Long Time For Guys To Learn 

1. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of
getting lost using a shortcut.
2. Women don&apos;t try as hard as men during sex; after all, they don&apos;t fall asleep afterwards.
3. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, &apos;How do I look?&apos;
4. PMS stands for: Permissible Manslaughter. (Or at least men think it means
that. PMS also stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My Spouse.
5. The first naked man a woman sees is &apos;Ken&apos;.
6. Women are insecure about their weight, butt, and breast sizes.
7. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.
8. &apos;Oh, nothing,&apos; has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it
does in man-language.
9. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction
that they are heading.
10. All women are overweight by definition; don&apos;t agree with them about it.
11. Women always have 5 pounds to lose, but don&apos;t bring this up unless they
really have 5 pounds to gain.
12. If it is not Valentines day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can
probably start up a conversation by asking, &apos;What did you do?&apos;
13. Only women understand the reason for &apos;guest towels&apos; and the &apos;good china&apos;.
14. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into
the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights.
15. All women seek equality with men until it comes to sharing the closet,
taking out the trash, and picking up the check.
16. If a man ticks off a woman she will often respond by getting a fuzzy toilet
cover which warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the lid to stay up
thus it constantly gets peed on by the guys. (which gets them in more trouble)
17. Women never check to see if the lid is up. They seem to prefer taking a
flying butt leap towards the bowl and then chewing men out because they &apos;left
the seat up&apos; instead of taking two seconds and lowering it themselves.
18. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men
arrested.
19. Women don&apos;t really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to
the contrary. You don&apos;t see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert
Gottfried, do you?
20. Women fake orgasm because men fake foreplay.
21. Women will spend hours dressing up to go out, and then they&apos;ll go out and
spend more time checking out other women. Men can never catch women checking out
other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.
22. The most embarrassing thing for women is to find another woman wearing the
same dress at a formal party. You don&apos;t hear men say, &apos;Oh-my-GOD, there&apos;s
another man wearing a black tux, get me out of here!&apos;

 Martha Stewart&apos;s Way vs. My Way 

Martha&apos;s way #1: Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent
ice cream drips.
My way: Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete&apos;s sake, you are
probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it anyway.

Martha&apos;s way #2: Use a meat baster to&quot;squeeze&quot;your pancake batter onto the
hot griddle and you&apos;ll get perfectly shaped pancakes every time.
My way: Buy the precooked kind you nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds. The hard part is
getting them out of the plastic bag.

Martha&apos;s way #3: To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the potatoes.
My way: Buy Hungry Jack mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to a year.

Martha&apos;s way #4: To prevent eggshells from cracking, add a pinch of salt to the water
before hard-boiling.
My way: Who cares if they crack, aren&apos;t you going to take the shells off anyway?

Martha&apos;s way #5: To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to room
temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing.
My way: Sleep with the lemons in between the mattress and box springs.

Martha&apos;s way #6: To easily remove burnt-on food from your skillet, simply add a drop or
two of dish soap and enough water to cover bottom of pan, and bring to a boil on stovetop.
My way: Eat at Chili&apos;s every night and avoid cooking.

Martha&apos;s way #7: Spray your Tupperware with nonstick cooking spray before pouring in
tomato based sauces and there won&apos;t be any stains.
My way: Feed your garbage disposal and there won&apos;t be any leftovers.

Martha&apos;s way #8: When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the
dry cake mix instead and there won&apos;t be any white mess on the outside of the cake.
My way: Go to the bakery. They&apos;ll even decorate it for you.

Martha&apos;s way #9: If you accidentally over salt a dish while it&apos;s still cooking,
drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant&quot;fix me up&quot;.
My way: If you over salt a dish while you are cooking, that&apos;s too damn bad. My motto: I
made it and you will eat it and I don&apos;t care how bad it tastes.

Martha&apos;s way #10: Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it
will keep for weeks.
My way: Celery? Never heard of the stuff.

Martha&apos;s way #11: Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a
beautiful glossy finish.
My way: The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the
crust and so I don&apos;t do it.

Martha&apos;s way #12: Place a slice of apple in hardened brown sugar to soften it.
My Way: Brown sugar is supposed to be&quot;soft&quot;?

Martha&apos;s way #13: When boiling corn on the cob, add a pinch of sugar to help bring out
the corn&apos;s natural sweetness.
My Way: The only kind of corn I buy comes in a can.

Martha&apos;s way #14: To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of cool,
salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh, but if it rises to the surface, throw it
away.
My way: Eat, cook, or use the egg anyway. If you feel bad later, you will know
it wasn&apos;t fresh.

Martha&apos;s way #15: Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub It on your
forehead. The throbbing will go away.
My way: Martha, dear, the only reason this works is because you can&apos;t rub a lime on your
forehead without getting lime juice in your eye, and then the problem isn&apos;t the headache
anymore; it is because you are now blind.

Martha&apos;s way #16: Don&apos;t throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for
future use in casseroles and sauces.
My way: Leftover wine?

Martha&apos;s way #17: If you have a problem opening jars: Try using latex dishwashing
gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy.
My way: Go ask the very cute neighbor to do it.

Martha&apos;s way #18: Potatoes will take food stains off your fingers. Just slice and rub
raw potato on the stains and rinse with water.
My way: Mashed potatoes will now be replacing the antibacterial soap in the handy
dispenser next to my sink.

Martha&apos;s way #19: Now look what you can do with Alka Seltzer.
* Clean a toilet. Drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets, wait twenty minutes, brush and
flush. The citric acid and effervescent action clean vitreous china.
* Clean a vase. To remove a stain from the bottom of a glass vase or cruet, fill with
water and drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets.
* Polish jewelry. Drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets into a glass of water and immerse
the jewelry for two minutes.
* Clean a thermos bottle. Fill the bottle with water, drop in four Alka-Seltzer
tablets, and let soak for an hour (or longer, if necessary).
My way: Put your jewelry, vases, and thermos in the toilet. Add some Alka-Seltzer and you
have solved a whole bunch of problems at once.

 You asked for it 

 Three guys are having a relaxing day of fishing. Out of the blue, they
catch a mermaid -- who begs to be set free, in return for granting each of them a wish. 

 One of the guys just doesn&apos;t believe it, and says,&quot;Okay, if you
can really grant wishes, then double my IQ.&quot;The mermaid says,&quot;Done.&quot;Suddenly, the guy starts reciting Shakespeare flawlessly, and
analyzing what he&apos;s recited with great insight. 

 The second guy is so amazed he says to the mermaid,&quot;Triple my
IQ.&quot;The mermaid says,&quot;Done.&quot;The guy starts to spout
solutions to problems that have been stumping all the great scientists of the world:
the mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and so on. 

 The last guy is so enthralled with the changes in his friends that he
says to the mermaid,&quot;Quintuple my IQ&quot;The mermaid looks at him and
says,&quot;You know, I normally don&apos;t try to change people&apos;s minds when they make a wish,
but I really think you should reconsider.&quot;The guy says,&quot;Nope, I want you to
multiply my IQ times five, and if you don&apos;t do it, I won&apos;t set you free.&quot; 

 &quot;Please,&quot;the mermaid says,&quot;you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re
asking! It&apos;ll change your entire view on the universe. Won&apos;t you ask for something
else, a million dollars, anything?&quot;But no matter what the mermaid says, the guy
insists on having his IQ increased to five times its usual power. 

 Finally, the mermaid sighs and says,&quot;Done.&quot; 

 And he turns into a woman.

 Inner Peace 

My therapist told me a way to achieve inner peace was to finish things I had started.

Today I finished two bags of potato chips and a chocolate cake.

I feel better already.
 
 Whoops 

A man was sick and tired of going to work every day while his wife stayed home. He
wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed,

&quot;Dear Lord, I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays
at home. I want her to know what I go through, so please create a trade in our
bodies.&quot;God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man&apos;s wish.

The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for
his mate, awakened the kids, set out their school clothes, fed them breakfast, packed
their lunches, drove them to school, came home and picked up the dry cleaning, took it to
the cleaners and stopped at the bank to draw out money to pay the power bill and telephone
bill, drove to the power company and the phone company and paid the bills, went grocery
shopping, came home and put away the groceries. He cleaned the cat&apos;s litter box and bathed
the dog. Then it was already 1 p.m. and he hurried to make the beds, do the laundry,
vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids
and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out cookies and milk and got the
kids organized to do their homework,then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he
did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing greens for salad, breaded
the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper he cleaned the kitchen,
ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed. At 9 p.m. he was
exhausted and, though his daily chores weren&apos;t finished, he went to bed where he was
expected to make love-which he managed to get through without complaint.

The next morning he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said,

&quot;Lord, I don&apos;t know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife&apos;s being
able to stay home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back.&quot;The Lord, in his
infinite wisdom, replied,&quot;My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be
happy to change things back to the way they were.

You&apos;ll have to wait 9 months, though. You got pregnant last night.&quot;
 
 The Five Questions Most Feared By Men
 
1. What are you thinking about?
2. Do you love me?
3. Do I look fat?
4. Do you think she is prettier than me?
5. What would you do if I died?

What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a
major argument if the man answers incorrectly (ie tells the truth). Therefore, as a public
service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.
___________________________________________________

Question # 1: What are you thinking about?

The proper answer to this, of course, is:&quot;I&apos;m sorry if I&apos;ve been pensive, dear. I
was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you
are, and how lucky I am to have met you.&quot;

This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is
one of the following:

a. Baseball.
b. Football.
c. How fat you are.
d. How much prettier she is than you.
e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.

Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg,&quot;If I wanted you to know
what I was thinking, I would be talking to you.&quot;
________________________________________________

Question # 2: Do you love me?

The proper response is:&quot;YES!&quot;or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in
order,&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;

Inappropriate responses include:

a. Oh Yeah, shit-loads.
b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?
c. That depends on what you mean by love.
d. Does it matter?
e. Who, me?
____________________________________________________

Question # 3: Do I look fat?

The correct answer is an emphatic:&quot;Of course not!&quot;

Among the incorrect answers are:

a. Compared to what?
b. I wouldn&apos;t call you fat, but you&apos;re not exactly thin.
c. A little extra weight looks good on you.
d. I&apos;ve seen fatter.
e. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the
insurance money if you died.
____________________________________________________

Question # 4: Do you think she&apos;s prettier than me?

Once again, the proper response is an emphatic:&quot;Of course not!&quot;

Incorrect responses include:

a. Yes, but you have a better personality
b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner
c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age
d. Define pretty
e. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the
insurance money if you died.
____________________________________________________

Question # 5: What would you do if I died?

A definite no-win question. (The real answer, of course, is&quot;Buy a Corvette and a
boat&quot;).

No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions,
usually along the these lines:

WOMAN: Would you get married again?

MAN: Definitely not!

WOMAN: Why not-don&apos;t you like being married?

MAN: Of course I do.

WOMAN: Then why wouldn&apos;t you remarry?

MAN: Okay, I&apos;d get married again.

WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)

MAN: ( makes audible groan )

WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?

MAN: Where else would we sleep?

WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?

MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.

WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?

MAN: She can&apos;t use them; she&apos;s left-handed.

WOMAN: - - - silence - - -

MAN: shit.

 Modern Day Fairy Tale 

(A fairy tale for the assertive woman of the 2000s)

Once upon a time, in a land far away, A beautiful, independent, self assured princess,
happened upon a frog as she sat contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an
unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle.

The frog hopped into the Princess&apos; lap and said: Elegant Lady, I was once a handsome
Prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me.

One kiss from you, however and I will turn back into the dapper, young Prince that I am
and then, my sweet, we can marry and set up housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother,
where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel
grateful and happy doing so.

That night, on a repast of lightly sauted frogs legs seasoned in a white wine and
onion cream sauce, she chuckled to herself and thought:

I don&apos;t fucking think so...

 Ode To a Mammogram 

For years and years they told me,
Be careful of your breasts,
Don&apos;t ever squeeze or bruise them,
And give them monthly tests.

So I heeded all their warnings,
And protected them by law.
Guarded them very carefully,
And I always wore my bra.

After thirty years of astute care,
My Doctor found a lump.
She ordered up a mammogram,
To look inside that bump.

&quot;Stand up very close,&quot;she said,
As she got my boob in line.
&quot;And, tell me when it hurts,&quot;she said.
&quot;Ah yes! There, that&apos;s fine.&quot;

She stepped upon a peddle.
I could not believe my eyes!
A plastic plate pressed down and down,
My boob was in a vice!

My skin was stretched and stretched,
From way up under my chin.
My poor boob was being squashed,
To Swedish pancake thin.

Excruciating pain I felt,
Within it&apos;s vice-like grip.
A prisoner in this vicious thing,
My poor defenceless tits!

&quot;Take a deep breath,&quot;she said to me,
Who does she think she&apos;s kidding?
My chest is mashed in her machine,
And woozy I am getting.

&quot;There, that was good,&quot;I heard her say
As the room was slowly swaying.
&quot;Now let&apos;s have a go at the other one.&quot;
&quot;Lord have mercy,&quot;I was praying.

It squeezed me from up and down,
It squeezed me from both sides,
I&apos;ll bet she&apos;s never had this done,
Not to her tender little hide!

If I had no problem when I came in,
I surely have one now.
If there had been a cyst in there,
It would have popped, Ker-pow!

This machine was designed by man,
Of this I have no doubt,
I&apos;d like to stick his balls in there.
And see how they come out!

 There&apos;s more... 

 Mammogram Exercises 

Many women are afraid of their first mammogram, but there is no need to worry. By
taking a few minutes each day for a week preceding the exam and doing the following
practice exercises, you will be totally prepared for the test, and best of all, you can do
these simple practice exercises right in your home.

EXERCISE 1:

Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast between the door and the main box.
Have one of your strongest friends slam the door shut as hard as possible and lean on the
door for good measure. Hold that position for five seconds. Repeat again in case the first
time wasn&apos;t effective enough.

EXERCISE 2:

Visit your garage at 3 AM when the temperature of the cement floor is just perfect. Take
off all your clothes and lie comfortably on the floor with one breast wedged under the
rear tire of the car. Ask a friend to slowly back the car up until your breast is
sufficiently flattened and chilled. Turn over and repeat for the other breast.

EXERCISE 3:

Freeze two metal bookends overnight. Strip to the waist. Invite a stranger into the
room. Press the bookends against one of your breasts. Smash the bookends together as hard
as you can. Set an appointment with the stranger to meet next year and do it again. You
are now properly prepared.

&quot;My husband claims to be a great sexual athlete, just because he
always comes first.&quot;(Ellie Lane)

 What&apos;s he made of? 

Element Name: MANIUM
Symbol: XY
Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)

Physical properties: Solid at room temperature, but gets bent out of shape
easily. Fairly dense and sometimes flaky. Difficult to find a pure sample.

Due to rust, ageing samples are unable to conduct electricity as easily as
young samples.

Chemical properties: Attempts to bond with WO any chance it can
get. Also tends to form strong bonds with itself. Becomes explosive when mixed with KD
(Element: CHILDIUM) for prolonged period of time. Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.

Usage: None known. Possibly good methane source. Good samples are able to
produce large quantities on command.

Caution: In the absence of WO , this element
rapidly decomposes and begins to smell.

The nice men are ugly. The handsome men are not nice. The handsome and nice men are
gay. The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married. The men who are not so handsome
but are nice men have no money. The men who are not so handsome but are nice men with
money think we are only after their money. The handsome men without money are after our
money. The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual don&apos;t think we are
beautiful enough. The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice
and have money are cowards. The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some
money and thank God are heterosexual are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!!!! The men
who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us when we take the
initiative.

NOW... WHO UNDERSTANDS MEN?
 
 Men mean... 

I&apos;M GOING FISHING
Translated: I&apos;m going to drink myself dangerously stupid and stand by a stream with a
stick in my hand, while the fish swim by in complete safety.

IT&apos;S A GUY THING
Translated: There is no rational thought pattern connected with it, and you have no chance
at all of making it logical.

CAN I HELP WITH DINNER?
Translated: Why isn&apos;t it already on the table?

UH HUH, SURE HONEY, YES DEAR
Translated: Absolutely nothing. It&apos;s a conditioned response.

IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN
Translated: I have no idea how it works.

TAKE A BREAK HONEY, YOU&apos;RE WORKING TOO HARD
Translated: I can&apos;t hear the game over the vacuum cleaner.

THAT&apos;S INTERESTING, DEAR
Translated: Are you still talking?

YOU KNOW HOW BAD MY MEMORY IS
Translated: I remember the theme song to &apos;F Troop&apos;, the address of the first girl I ever
kissed and the vehicle identification numbers of every car I&apos;ve ever owned, ... but I
forgot your birthday.

I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU, AND GOT YOU THESE ROSES
Translated: The girl selling them on the corner was a real babe.

OH, DON&apos;T FUSS, I JUST CUT MYSELF, IT&apos;S NO BIG DEAL
Translated: I have actually severed a limb, but will bleed to death before I admit that
I&apos;m hurt.

HEY, I&apos;VE GOT MY REASONS FOR WHAT I&apos;M DOING
Translated: And I sure hope I think of some pretty soon.

I CAN&apos;T FIND IT
Translated: It didn&apos;t fall into my outstretched hands, so I&apos;m completely clueless.

WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME?
Translated: What did you catch me at?

I HEARD YOU.
Translated: I haven&apos;t the foggiest clue what you just said, and am hoping desperately that
I can fake it well enough so that you don&apos;t spend the next 3 days yelling at me.

YOU KNOW I COULD NEVER LOVE ANYONE ELSE
Translated: I am used to the way you yell at me, and realise it could be worse.

YOU LOOK TERRIFIC
Translated: Oh, God, please don&apos;t try on one more outfit, I&apos;m starving.

I&apos;M NOT LOST, I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE
Translated: No one will ever see us alive again.

WE SHARE THE HOUSEWORK
Translated: I make the messes, she cleans them up.

an afterthought, he will forget two of the first five.
 
 Men Are Like... 

Men are like... commercials. You can&apos;t believe a word they say.

Men are like... computers. Hard to figure out and never have enough memory.

Men are like... coolers. Load them with beer and you can take them anywhere.

Men are like... place mats. They only show up when there&apos;s food on the table.

Men are like... mascara. They usually run at the first sign of emotion.

Men are like... bike helmets. Handy in an emergency, but otherwise they just look silly.

Men are like... bananas. The older they get, the less firm they are.

Men are like... government bonds. They take so long to mature.

Men are like... parking spots. All the good ones are taken and what&apos;s left is handicapped.

Men are like... used cars. Both are easy-to-get, cheap, and unreliable.

Men are like... vacations. They never seem to be long enough.

Men are like... copiers. You need them for reproduction, but that&apos;s about it.

Men are like... lava lamps. Fun to look at, but not all that bright.

Men are like... bank accounts. Without a lot of money, they don&apos;t generate much interest.

Men are like... horoscopes. They always tell you what to do and are usually wrong.

Men are like... weather. Nothing can be done to change either one of them.

Men are like... blenders. You need one, but you&apos;re not quite sure why.

Men are like... curling irons. They&apos;re always hot, and they&apos;re always in your hair.

Men are like... noodles. They&apos;re always in hot water, they lack taste, and they need dough.

Men are like.....plungers. They spend most of their lives in a hardware store or bathroom.

Men are like... high heels. They&apos;re easy to walk on once you get the hang of it.

Men are like... miniskirts. If you&apos;re not careful, they&apos;ll creep up your legs.

Men are like department stores... their clothes should always be half off.

Men are like chocolate bars... sweet, smooth, and they usually head right for your hips.

Men are like coffee... the best ones are rich, warm, and can keep you up all night long.

Men are like cement... after getting laid, they take a long time to get hard.

Men are like laxatives... they irritate the shit out of you.

A man is like a snowstorm... you never know when he&apos;s coming, how many inches you&apos;ll
get, or how long he will last.
 
 Every Woman&apos;s Fantasy 

A woman was sitting at a bar enjoying an after work cocktail with her girlfriends when
an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely sexy young man entered. He was so striking that
the woman could not take her eyes away from him. The young man noticed her overly
attentive stare and walked directly toward them. Before she could offer her apologies for
being so rude for staring, the young man said to her,&quot;I&apos;ll do anything, absolutely
anything, that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $100, on one condition.&quot;

Flabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. The young man replied,&quot;You
have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words.&quot;The woman considered his
proposition for a moment, withdrew from her purse and slowly counted out five $20 bills,
which she gladly pressed into the young man&apos;s hand. She looked deeply into his eyes and
slowly, meaningfully, said,

 Heartbroken 

Mildred was a 93-year-old woman who was particularly despondent over the recent death
of her husband. She decided that she would just kill herself and join him in death.

Thinking that it would be best to get it over with quickly, she took out his old Army
pistol and made the decision to shoot herself in the heart, since it was so badly broken
in the first place.

Not wanting to miss the vital organ, and become a vegetable and burden to someone, she
called her doctor&apos;s office to inquire as to just exactly where the heart would be.

&quot;On a woman&quot;, the doctor said,&quot;Your heart would be just below your left
breast.&quot;

Later that night, Mildred was admitted to the hospital with a gunshot wound to her left
knee.
 
A man is driving fast down a steep, narrow mountain road. A woman is driving up the
same road. As they pass each other, the woman leans out of the window and yells&quot;PIG!!&quot;The man immediately leans out of his window and replies,&quot;BITCH!!&quot;

They each continue on their way, and as the man rounds the next corner, he sees a pig
in the middle of the road, swerves to avoid it and drives off the cliff, dying a fiery
death.

If only men would listen.

 Readers&apos; feedback and
comments . 

 Written with the experience and insight only a fellow
experiencer can impart, Bully in sight validates the experience of bullying when
everyone else is trying to deny it. The injury to health caused by stress resulting from
bullying and harassment is described in detail. 

 Bully in sight identifies bullying as a major
cause of stress and the common denominator of harassment, discrimination, prejudice,
abuse, conflict and violence. Bully in sight provides a chillingly accurate
portrayal of the principal perpetrator of psychological violence, the serial bully , a joyless,
humorless, loveless individual who is a compulsive liar with a Jekyll&amp;Hyde nature
who has a compulsive need to control through constant trivial criticism and a pathological
refusal to value and recognise. 

 Packed with insight, ideas and direction, plus sources of
help and suggested reading.

 &quot;This is the book I so badly wanted when I was
traumatised.&quot;
 David Kinchin, Author 

 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: the invisible injury provides clear, practical advice for recovery from major traumatic experiences, including
violence, harassment, assault, rape, accident, fire, explosion, disaster, or witnessing such events. 

 PTSD is a natural emotional reaction to a deeply shocking
and disturbing experience. The symptoms are surprisingly common and include sleep
problems, nightmares and waking early, impaired memory, inability to concentrate,
hypervigilance (feels like but is not paranoia), jumpiness and exaggerated
startle response, fragility and hypersensitivity, irritability, violent outbursts, joint
and muscle pains, panic attacks, fatigue, low self-esteem, exaggerated feelings of guilt,
feelings of nervousness and anxiety.
