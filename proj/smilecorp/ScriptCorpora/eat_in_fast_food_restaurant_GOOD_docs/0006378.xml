 Israel&apos;s UN envoy: PA, Iran, Syria statements declaration of
war 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/19/2006

and Palestinian leaders &quot;declarations of war,&quot; after an Islamic Jihad
bomber blew himself up outside a Tel Aviv restaurant, killing nine and
wounding dozens more. Two diplomats on Monday opened a UN Security
Council debate that included some 35 speakers. The session had been

week refused to agree to a compromise statement on recent Israeli

critical of Israel. &quot;Nevertheless, the Palestinian UN observer, Riyad

yesterday&apos;s suicide attack in Tel Aviv. However, Hamas defended the
attack as &quot;a natural reaction. &quot;Abbas, who is on a visit to Jordan,
called the attack &quot;an act of terror and a despicable act that is also
beyond the national Palestinian consensus and causes damage to
Palestinian national interests. &quot; Abbas called on the international
community to intervene in the territories &quot;to stop the dangerous
deterioration in the situation. &quot;But the spokesman of the Hamas
government, Razi Hamad, said: &quot;The Israeli occupation bears
responsibility for the consequences of its policies. We have
continuously repeated that the occupation is the reason for the cycle
of violence. &quot;

4/19/2006
UNITED NATIONS: Israel has warned that a new &quot;axis of terror&quot; - Iran,
Syria and the Hamas-run Palestinian government - is sowing the seeds of
the first world war of the 21st century. But the Palestinians accused
Israel of an escalating and indiscriminate military campaign that
targets civilians and entrenches its occupation. The Israeli and
Palestinian envoys traded charges late Monday at an open Security
Council meeting held in response to the recent upsurge in Israeli
attacks in Gaza. The session had been scheduled before the suicide
bombing Monday in Tel Aviv. Recent statements by the Palestinian
government, Iran and Syria, including one by Hamas defending Monday&apos;s

Hamad, said that the Government has been able to get 300 Million US
dollars in aid, but is unable to get the money into Palestine. Hamad
said that he the economic crisis which the Government faces is less
than first thought as many Arab countries, including Qatar, Kuwait and
the UAE, donated money to the Palestinian Authority without conditions–unlike the US and other Western donors who give aid with stringent
conditions to be adhered to. Speaking at Bir Zeit University, Hamad
repeated his vision of how to change the current situation–especially
the political situation in the Gaza Strip. He stressed that the failure
of the Government will be the failure of every one - and that will be

people. -- WORLD CAPITALS - With millions of Palestinians hardly able
to make ends meet, several Arab and Muslim countries offered aid to the
cash-strapped Palestinian Authority while local fund-raising campaigns
have been launched across the Muslim world to counter international aid
freeze. Iran announced on Monday, April 17, that it was giving $100
million in aid to the new Hamas-led Palestinian government, doubling
the initial figure it announced a day earlier. Qatar also confirmed

fractured Fatah movement threatened on Monday to attack Jews overseas

8,000 prisoners held by Israel, but neither explicitly backed attacks
on Jews abroad. The call by militants of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades

which has been crippled financially by the loss of Western aid, and of
tax and customs revenues frozen by Israel, after Hamas&apos;s crushing
electoral win over Fatah in January.

Palestinian Authority has outstanding debts of some $1. 3 billion and
is fast running out of credit with banks, Finance Minister Omar

Fatah faction, saying it had added thousands of people to the
government payroll during its last days in office.

 Palestinians feel the pinch 
By Alan Johnston,
BBC 4/18/2006
Like all of Gaza&apos;s tens-of-thousands of government employees, Hassan
Sallah is worried about money. Nobody can tell him when his next pay
cheque will arrive. The new Hamas government has walked into a major
financial crisis. Its refusal to renounce violence and recognise Israel
has led to the halting of large amounts of European and American
economic support. And Israel itself has withheld payments of tens of
millions of dollars that it owes the Palestinians. Mr Sallah works as a
nurse in the accident and emergency department of the Kamal Adwan
hospital, in northern Gaza. But during a cigarette break, he reflected
on what Hamas&apos;s troubles meant for him. He struggles to support seven
children on about $450 a month.

Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh has leveled unprecedented
criticism at Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, accusing the &quot;presidential institution&quot; of trying to deny the elected Palestinian

full term, and warned that bringing about its downfall would have

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas for condemning Monday&apos;s
deadly suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, in their harshest criticism yet of
the moderate leader over his stand on violence. The criticism,

Palestinian Centre
for Human Rights 4/18/2006
PCHR is gravely concerned over continued military operations conducted
by Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) in the northern Gaza Strip, which
have caused many casualties among Palestinian civilians. On Monday

artillery shells at Sheikh Zayed town to the east of Beit Lahia. One of
the shells fell near a playground located approximately 300 meters away

the already deteriorated situation in the OPT, Al-Haq and Al-Mezan

further diminish the Palestinians&apos; ability to enjoy their fundamental

 Some Palestinian reactions to the suicide bombing 
International
Solidarity Movement 4/18/2006
From Sa’eed Yakin, the coordinator of the Popular Committee in the
northwest Jerusalem area:“The first thing I would like to say is that
we are categorically against the killing of civilians on both sides.
The second thing is that this suicide bombing came as a result of the
Israeli policy, especially that of the last two months... From Mohammed
Issa Abadia, Jenin District popular committee against the wall,
settlements, and occupation:“This kind of resistance [the suicide
bombing] doesn’t lead to any positive result, but the reason behind it
is that there is nobody and no state in the world really supporting the
Palestinian Popular struggle.... From Fatma al Khaldi, member of the
Popular Resistance in Salfit District:“Insulting people all the time in
checkpoints, humiliating them in many other situations; this led to
this thing.

 Remaining Human Rights Workers Threatened with Expulsion from
Hebron 
International
Solidarity Movement 4/18/2006
The Israeli Army has threatened human rights workers in Hebron with
further expulsions from the H2 zone, near the Old Souk (market). The
activists from the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) and Tel
Rumeida Project (TRP) have a small apartment in the zone, which is
under Israeli Army control. The H2 zone is right in the middle of the
historic old city, where militant Jewish settlers have established two
illegal settlements. Six human rights workers were expelled last night.
Tension has been building throughout the Jewish Passover Holy period,
when the settlers receive thousands of visitors, who share their belief
that Hebron, with its population of over 110,000 Palestinians, should
be an exclusively Jewish city.

 New House Occupations in Nablus 
International
Solidarity Movement 4/18/2006
Pictures from yesterday’s house occupations -- Today, the Israeli army
has occupied three more buildings in Nablus that we are aware of. One
of them is a brand new shopping mall which has not yet opened. The
local youth are outside burning tyres in protest. This will have little
effect on the soldiers who are at least 10 stories up. Despite this
they are firing live ammunition. Yesterday’s woundings of two boys has
not deterred them in the least. - The doors that the soldiers were
using as shields - I need to stress this further: the soldiers are
recklessly and randomly firing live ammunition down onto an area
crowded with market traders, women, children and workers. This is
madness - it utterly disgusts me. Some locals may have learned to live
with these army invasions - what choice do they have after all?

Take a trip to Qawawis and you step back in time, yet remain in a
surreal and frightening present. -- It’s an extraordinary place of
stark beauty, situated at the extreme southern tip of the Occupied West
Bank. Most of the people live in ancient limestone cave dwellings,
variously enlarged and improved over the centuries. Yet each is swept
spotlessly clean, belying first impressions that an ancient lifestyle
means dirt and squalor. Qawawis itself is tiny, home to just five
Palestinian families. The population varies depending on who’s brother,
sister, aunt or other relative happens to be around, but it is usually
between 15 to 50 people.

 Palestinians commemorate Prisoners Day, as all hell breaks
loose 
By Laila el-Haddad,
International Solidarity Movement 4/18/2006
I’m very tired so instead of posting something on how all hells break
loose here between one second and the next, and how just when you say
to yourself-well how about that, only 20 shells today! and no
gunbattles between bickering testosterone charged gunmen with nothing
better to do! and no suicide bombings!…well.. needless to say, things
have a way of turning very bad, very quickly here. 9 killed in Tel
Aviv, another Palestinian boy killed in Beit Lahiya by Israeli shelling
(that makes 16 since the start of the year)…and I just heard an
explosion near my house…so.. instead, I’m going to talk about
commemorations of Palestinian Prisoners Day (yes, we have so many“days”), and then go to sleep, because God knows we ALL need sleep.

 Jab’a Ploughs its Land 
International
Solidarity Movement 4/18/2006
This morning I travelled to the village of Jab’a, just South of
Bethlehem, where local Palestinian farmers have faced intimidation by
settlers when trying to access their land. Jab’a is a village of 900
people facing annexation of part of its land by the Apartheid Wall. It
is near the Gush Etziyon settlement block and faces frequent problems
with settler violence. This morning about 50 Internationals, Israelis
and Palestinians converged at Om Al Jamjoum below the illegal
settlement of Beit Ain to plough the land. Settlers watched from the
hilltop settlement as Palestinians brought a tractor onto the land for
the first time in five years.

 DCI/PS call to action on Palestinian Prisoners&apos; Day 
Defence for Children
International - Palestine 4/17/2006
It is a sad irony that Palestinian Prisoners&apos; Day comes this year as
massive numbers of Palestinian children are being arrested and detained
by Israeli forces. In the first quarter of 2006 alone, some 350
children were arrested–compared to around 700 child arrests in the
whole of 2005. The vast increase in arrests is in turn leading to
overcrowding in prisons as record numbers of juveniles are being held
in unsuitable and unhygienic conditions. Since the beginning of this
intifada in September 2000, Israeli forces have arrested around 4,000
Palestinian children, 400 of whom are still in Israeli prisons and
detention centres.

 The fight to not fight 
The Guardian
4/17/2006
Can a feminist serve in a male-dominated military? Rachel Shabi meets
the Israeli conscript who argued that she could not - and won an
exemption -- Idan Halili, just 19 years old, has written a feminist
critique that has astounded established feminist voices around the
world. Her analysis takes the form of a letter sent to the Israeli army
asking for exemption from compulsory service, based on a feminist
rejection of militarism. Last December, having spent two weeks in
military prison because of her refusal to serve, Halili was exempted
from conscription; her views, she was told, deemed her &quot;unsuitable&quot;. &quot;The army is an organisation whose most fundamental values cannot be
brought in harmony with feminist values,&quot; she wrote in her request for
exemption.

 IDF accused of &apos;knowingly risking Palestinian lives&apos; 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/17/2006
Six human rights organizations appealed the High Court on Sunday to
cancel a regulation which allows Israel Defense Forces artillery to
fire shells at targets up to 100 meters away from Palestinian houses.
Last week Defense Minister Shual Mofaz reduced the safety range down
from 300 meters in an effort to put a stop to Qassam rocket fire from
the Gaza Strip into Israel. Attorney Michael Sfard claimed on behalf of
the human rights organizations that Mofaz&apos;s decision deliberately
endangers Palestinian lives because the shells are known to land within
a 100-meter spread from their targets. IDF officers admitted that the
new regulations put Palestinian lives at risk but insisted it would
help strike back at Palestinian militants launching rockets at Israeli
civilians.

International
Solidarity Movement 4/17/2006
The Israeli army has withdrawn from one of the homes occupied earlier
today in Nablus, although as many as five other houses remain occupied.
The twelve soldiers left the Mushara home at 3pm, after having occupied
it since 3:30am Monday. The family, four children between the ages of

told that if they made any noise the soldiers would kill them. When
their neighbors knocked on the door this morning, to pick the children
up for school as usual, the soldiers responded by firing shots at the
ceiling.

 IDF delays Palestinians at northern West Bank roadblocks 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/15/2006
Israel Defense Forces soldiers Saturday delayed thousands of
Palestinian residents seeking to pass through roadblocks in the
northern West Bank, left wing activists told Haaretz. The unannounced
curfew disrupted regular business and school activities. Some thousand
Palestinians were delayed at the Beit Iba roadblock at the entrance to
the city of Nablus. Activists of Machsom Watch - Women for Human Rights
were unable to find out whether this was because the roadblock had been
shut down for traffic or due to stricter searches on those entering the
city. At the Tapuach roadblock south of Nablus connecting the northern
and southern parts of the West Bank, some 90 cars lined up due to
identity card inspections. Palestinians reported a minimum two-hour
wait at the roadblock.

 Lawlessness continues in Palestine 
Ma&apos;an News 4/18/2006
Ma’an-After almost six years of an uprising or Intifada against the
Israeli Occupation, the main element which prevails in the Palestinian

ideas for possible strikes against the Palestinian Authority, and
though the government is responsible, the decision was that there
should be more limited action for now,&quot; said a political source. &quot;Israel will exercise its inherent right of self-defense and will take

bustling commercial area of Tel Aviv during the Jewish holiday of
Passover today, killing himself and eight [nine] people and wounding 49

response to Israeli &quot;aggression. &quot; Israel said it held Hamas ultimately
responsible, even though a different militant group, Islamic Jihad,

 IDF, police fail to prevent settler march in closed military
zone 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/16/2006
Settlers on Sunday broke through a ring of Israel Defense Forces troops
and police and held a march from the West Bank settlement of Beit El to
the nearby Gush Talmonim, Israel Radio reported. Security forces
refused to approve the march because its intended route had been shut
down to Israelis after several shooting attacks by Palestinians. The
purpose of the march was to protest the route&apos;s closure five years ago
with the outbreak of the second Intifada. Settlers entered the area
despite the army&apos;s refusal and in defiance of a order declaring the
area a closed military zone. As a result, hundreds of participants
faced army and police who tried to prevent them from holding the march.

admitted taking the two M-16 assault rifles from the soldiers at
gunpoint. They told Shin Bet forces that on the night of the incident,

the soldiers barracks. After deciding the Palestinians were not members
of any terrorist organizations and that their actions were
criminally-motivated, the Shin Bet transferred the case to the police.

 Coalition talks to resume today after holiday break 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/16/2006
Coalition talks are set to continue today after a break for the
holidays. However, a meeting between the negotiating teams of Kadima
and Labor has been postponed until tomorrow because Labor has not yet
received a draft of the government guidelines from Prime
Minister-designate Ehud Olmert&apos;s party. One reason for the delay in
passing on the guidelines is a dispute over Labor&apos;s demand to raise the
minimum wage. Sources on the Labor negotiating team said they believed
the issue could be the cause of a crisis in the talks if Kadima&apos;s team
did not accede to Labor&apos;s demand to raise the minimum wage by NIS 500
as early as September 2006.

 Minimum wage conflict could torpedo coalition negotiations 
Globes 4/17/2006
Sources: A $1,000 a month minimum wage will boost unemployment,
inflation, speed shekel-dollar depreciation and require a higher
interest rate. -- Serious disagreements about raising the minimum wage
this year became an obstacle today, which could torpedo the coalition
negotiations between Kadima and the Labor Party, even if progress has
been made on most other issues. At the end of the third round of
negotiations, the Kadima chief negotiator Yoram A. Turbowicz and Labor
chief negotiator David Libai agreed to defer the issue to next week.
Kadima and Labor do not disagree in principle about raising the minimum
wage, but on the timing and amount of the increase.

representative of Satan, not God. &quot;History,&quot; he said, &quot;has known how to

Israel has a lower rate of people holding doctoral degrees than most
developed and developing nations, placing it 22nd out of 45 countries.
Preliminary findings of a study conducted by the planning authority at

in comparison to other developed countries, but is also not in keeping
with Israel&apos;s ambitions to become a hi-tech power.

The marginal increase was due mainly to the fall in high-tech exports,
which previously increased over three preceding quarters. -- Israel’s
industrial export increased by only 1% to $3. 9 billion in
January-February 2006, said the Manufacturers Association in its
monthly analysis of quarterly trade figures. This was due mainly to a
0. 3% decrease in high-tech exports, which increased over three
preceding quarters. High-tech exports accounts for 50% of total
exports, excluding diamonds. Manufacturers Association president Shraga
Brosh expressed concern at the low growth in exports, noting that they
were still a long way from the estimated annual potential of 15-20%.

 American real estate tycoon buys J&apos;lem Gate Hotel 
Ha&apos;aretz 4/17/2006
The Jerusalem Gate Hotel at the entrance to the city has been purchased
by Jewish property developer Morris Willner of Philadelphia. Israeli
real-estate company Silver Fish bought the hotel two years ago from the
Yona family&apos;s Hefziba Housing&amp;Development. The 300-room hotel is
located over the larger Center 1 mall, which is also part of the deal.
Wilner owns several large malls in the United States, including in New
Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania. Willner is also a member of the
pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. Real-estate sector sources believe the price
Wilner paid is based on $65,000 per hotel room.

 Scheduled Israir flights to New York to begin May 1 
Globes 4/17/2006
Israir plans to apply for designated carrier status on European routes.
-- Israir Airlines and Tourism Ltd. will begin scheduled flights
between Tel Aviv and New York on May 1. In contrast to the airline’s
original plan, it will only start using wide-bodied jets on the route
in early 2007. The reason for the postponement is Israir’s negotiations
with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus on a comprehensive contract to procure
the planes. Israir CEO Sabina Biran said a uniform fleet was an
important factor in maintenance costs and in the training of air crew,
and it was therefore important to buy planes from a single
manufacturer. Israir plans to use wide-bodied planes on its New York
route and narrow-bodied planes on its European routes.

 Press Review: Islamic press tackles Palestinian aid &apos;crisis&apos; 
BBC 4/17/2006
Following Iran&apos;s pledge to give the Palestinian Authority $50m in aid,
two leading Iranian papers call for all Muslims to support the
Palestinian cause. Papers from other Islamic countries, however, raise
questions about the lack of aid from Arab countries, and Russia&apos;s
influence in the region after its own promise of emergency aid. One
Turkish commentator believes Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will
have his work cut out when he tries to drum up support in a visit to
Turkey next week.

 Differences stall Iraq government 
AlJazeera 4/19/2006
US forces in Iraq are facing one of the deadliest waves of unrest --
Iraqi rebels have staged bomb attacks and battled US forces in one of
the deadliest waves of violence since the 2003 invasion, as new
divisions arose over forming a unity government. Bickering politicians
said on Tuesday that talks on forming a government that had dragged on
for four months could take another month. At least six people were
killed in attacks, including four in a roadside bomb near a restaurant
in north Baghdad. An Iraqi army soldier was killed by gunmen on the
main road west of the northern city of Kirkuk, police said. And a
tribal shaikh was killed in an explosion after rebels planted a bomb in
his car south of Baghdad.

 Moscow talks end without Iran deal 
AlJazeera 4/19/2006
A meeting of major powers held in Moscow has ended without consensus
despite strong US pressure for international sanctions against Iran.
Tuesday&apos;s meeting of deputy foreign ministers of the UN Security
Council&apos;s five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France,
China and Russia - plus Germany, was called after Tehran declared last
week that it had enriched uranium and was aiming for industrial-scale
production. Also on Tuesday, George Bush, the US president, said he
would discuss Iran&apos;s nuclear activities with Hu Jintao, China&apos;s
president, who has been cool towards sanctions, when they meet on
Thursday.

 US has been planning &quot;Iran War&quot; since 2003 
China View 4/17/2006
BEIJING, April 17 -- The United States began planning a full-scale
military campaign against Iran that involves missile strikes, a land
invasion and a naval operation to establish control over the Strait of
Hormuz even before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, a former U.S.
intelligence analyst disclosed. William Arkin, who served as the U.S.
Army&apos;s top intelligence mind on West Berlin in the 1970s and accurately
predicted U.S. military operations against Iraq, said the plan is known
in military circles as TIRANNT, an acronym for &quot;Theater Iran Near Term. &quot;

 Siniora extracts promise of White House support 
The Daily Star
4/19/2006
BEIRUT: In a powerful show of support for Lebanon&apos;s government, U.S.
President George W. Bush renewed Tuesday his country&apos;s support for a
free, sovereign and independent Lebanon following talks with Premier
Fouad Siniora. &quot;I told the prime minister that the United States
strongly supports a free and independent and sovereign Lebanon,&quot; Bush
told reporters following the meeting at the White House. He cited the
country as an example of the type of democratic change he wants to see
in the Middle East, amid strains between Israelis and Palestinians, and
unrest in Iraq. &quot;There is no question in my mind that Lebanon can serve
as a great example for what is possible in the broader Middle East,&quot; he
said.

 Bush vow on Hariri murder probe 
BBC 4/18/2006
President George W Bush has said the US will work to ensure those
behind the killing of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri are brought to
justice. He was speaking after talks at the White House with Lebanon&apos;s
Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora. Mr Hariri&apos;s assassination in February
2005, was blamed on Lebanon&apos;s then political master, Syria. Damascus
denies the accusation, but had to withdraw its troops from Lebanon not
long after the assassination. The Lebanese government is still unable
to extend its authority over all the country, says the BBC&apos;s Kim
Ghattas. The Lebanese central state has rarely been strong, but Mr
Siniora wants to change that now, says our correspondent. &quot;For the past
- over 16 or 18 months - Lebanon has been undergoing major changes,&quot; Mr
Siniora told reporters after the White House talks.

 Amman gathering to focus on religious dimension of Iraqi
crisis 
China View 4/18/2006
AMMAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Islamic Reconciliation conference
(IIRC) due in Amman on April 22 will focus on the religious dimension
of the Iraqi crisis and &quot;Shiite-Sunni issue will figure high,&quot; Jordanian government spokesman Abdul-Salam Abbadi said on Tuesday.
Abbadi told reporters that the main objective of the conference is to
emphasize Iraq&apos;s unity and avoid further escalation that could lead to
sectarian strife. The political solution of the Iraqi crisis will not
succeed unless a religious solution is reached, therefore the success
of the conference depends on the participation of religious leaders,
Abbadi said.

 Shame of the House of Saud: Shadows over Mecca 
The Independent
4/19/2006
Sami Angawi, a Hijazi architect who has devoted his life to a largely
doomed effort to preserve what remains of the history of the world&apos;s
greatest pilgrimage sites, said that the final farewell to Mecca was
imminent. &quot;What we are witnessing are the last days of Mecca and
Medina. &quot; -- There is a growing shadow being cast over Islam&apos;s holiest
site. Only a few metres from the walls of the Grand Mosque in Mecca
skyscrapers are reaching further into the sky, slowly blocking out the
light. These enormous and garish newcomers now dwarf the elegant black
granite of the Kaaba, the focal point of the four million Muslims&apos;
annual Haj pilgrimage. The tower blocks are the latest and largest
evidence of the destruction of Islamic heritage that has wiped almost
all of the historic city from the physical landscape.


 Articles 
 The Israel Lobby and Beyond 
By Professor Michael Neumann, Palestine Chronicle 4/17/2006
      What really matters is whether support for Israel serves US interests. If it does, why on earth would we care about a pro-Israel lobby? 
    Professors Walt and Mearsheimer&apos;s &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; is an important contribution to the Israel/Palestine debate. It&apos;s too bad the important stuff got lost in the melodrama.
    The melodrama is about the Israel lobby, aka the &apos;Jewish lobby&apos;. One whiff of Jewish conspiracy theory, and squads of columnists march off to fight the Nazis lurking in academia. But at a bit of a distance, it&apos;s hard to see why tales of the lobby are so fascinating.
    Various self-styled Jewish organizations and pro-Israel outfits, like so many political pressure groups, brag about their success. No one suggests they&apos;re lying. Exactly how much influence do they have over US policy? To what extent are they responsible for getting the US into Iraq?
    We have no idea. US policy-making is a complicated business. Some of it is secret. People&apos;s motives and thought processes are often hidden. And to what extent are the lobbyists pushing decision-makers down a path they already want to go?
    I don&apos;t even find these questions interesting.
    What really matters is whether support for Israel serves US interests. If it does, why on earth would we care about a pro-Israel lobby? If it doesn&apos;t, then the lobby is a bad thing even if it didn&apos;t conspire to get us into Iraq.
    Walt and Mearsheimer are among the very few to address this important question head-on. They say: &quot;Israel is in fact a liability in the war on terror and the broader effort to deal with rogue states.&quot; They argue forcefully for their claim. They also bear some of the blame for failing to get this message across, because this material doesn&apos;t deserve the second-billing they gave it.

 US to Palestinians: Vote, Then Starve 
By James Brooks, Palestine Chronicle 4/18/2006
      This is our response to what most observers agree was the fairest, most transparent election ever conducted in the Arab Middle East. 
    On March 15, former World Bank president and current Quartet Middle East envoy James Wolfensohn warned Congress that unless stepped up Western aid was delivered to the Palestinian people, cutting off funds to the Palestinian Authority would result in“chaos in the streets”.
    “I do not believe you can have a million starving Palestinians and have peace,”Wolfensohn said with his gift for biting understatement.
    The following day, the Gaza Strip ran out of flour, due to months of Israeli border closures. The day after that there was no bread in Gaza. Then sugar, rice and other staples began to disappear from the shelves. For an imprisoned population of 1.5 million people, two-thirds of whom make less than $2 a day, it was a disaster.
    The following week, the first cases of deadly H5N1 bird flu were confirmed in the Gaza Strip. The resulting mass cullings of poultry dealt another severe blow to the meager and dwindling Gazan diet.
    On March 31, an EU mission declared the food crisis“serious”and found that it was largely caused by Israel’s relentless border closures. (6) A group of United Nations relief organizations warned on April 4 that the Gaza Strip is“on the verge of a humanitarian disaster.”
    Two days later, the US Congress addressed this looming catastrophe by voting to terminate the last remaining morsel of America’s financial aid to the Palestinian Authority.
    To make sure not one red cent of US taxpayer money winds up in the hands of Hamas, Congress also stopped all indirect aid to the occupied Palestinian territories, cutting some $240 million in development and assistance projects.
    At the same time, US humanitarian assistance to Palestinians was increased 57 percent, to $287 million. That works out to an extra $105 million, which, if actually delivered as direct aid, would amount to $23 for every Palestinian, enough to maintain their present poverty level for about twelve days.

 The Ongoing War on Truth in Iraq 
By Dahr Jamail, Truthout 4/18/2006
      The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honor. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information. The Baghdad communiqués are belated, insincere, incomplete. Things have been far worse than we have been told, our administration more bloody and inefficient than the public knows ... We are today not far from a disaster. -- T.E. Lawrence (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia), The Sunday Times, August 1920
    On Monday, April 17, my sources in Baghdad reported fierce fighting in the al-Adhamiya neighborhood of the capital city, as well as fighting in the al-Dora neighborhood. One source, who lives in the predominantly Sunni area of Adhamiya, had been telling me the situation was disintegrating for days leading up to this. There had been clashes every day for four days leading up to yesterday&apos;s huge clash there, with sporadic fighting between Sunni resistance fighters and members of the two largest Shia militias. The armed wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the Badr Organization, and Muqtada al-Sadr&apos;s Mehdi Army have been launching ongoing attacks against fighters in the neighborhood. There is a shorter version of this description.
    Civil war.
    Yet we don&apos;t hear it described as such in the corporate media, nor from the Cheney administration. Their propaganda insists that Iraq is not yet in a civil war.
    But in Adhamiya, every night now for several weeks roads have been closed with tires, trunks of date palm trees and other objects to prevent &quot;kidnappers and Shia death squads&quot; from entering the area, according to one source, whom I&apos;m keeping anonymous for security reasons.
    His description of the fierce fighting in his neighborhood is quite different from the reporting of it in mainstream outlets.

 Lesson from Deir Yassin 
By Iqbal Jassat, Palestine Chronicle 4/18/2006
      The little bewildered boy who came to realize the extent of a &apos;true misfortune&apos; that had befallen the Arab Palestinians, was none other than Edward Said. 
    &quot;More than any single occurrence in my memory of that difficult period, it was Deir Yassin that stood out in all its awful and intentional fearsomeness - the stories of rape, of children with their throats slit, mothers disemboweled, and the like.&quot;
    These are the memories of a twelve-year-old Palestinian refugee, who with his parents, and sisters left Palestine for the last time during the latter part of December 1947.
    This little bewildered boy who shortly thereafter came to realize the extent of a &quot;true misfortune&quot; that had befallen the Arab Palestinians, was none other than Edward Said.
    Years later as Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, Said became renowned as one of the world&apos;s most influential literary and cultural critic and also as a leading authority on the Middle East.
    In an article published in Cairo&apos;s al-Ahram five decades after that single occurrence, Said recollected that by mid-spring of 1948 every one of his extended family on both sides, paternal and maternal - uncles, aunts, cousins - had become refugees scattered throughout the Arab world.
    His growing awareness of the question of Palestine by fragmented reports on forced removals and massacres not only gripped his imagination, it also made a huge impression on him.

 Last chance for two states 
By Manuel Hassassian, The Guardian 4/19/2006
     Negotiation rather than unilateralism is the way out of the spiralling Israeli-Palestinian crisis
    Monday&apos;s suicide bombing in Tel Aviv rightly drew international condemnation, yet criticism of Israel&apos;s relentless shelling of civilian population centres in the occupied Gaza Strip has been blocked by the US at the UN security council. This month alone, Israeli forces have killed more than 30 Palestinians, including at least six children, and injured 130 others, while about 200 shells have been fired into the Gaza Strip every day.
    While prominent members of the international community call on Hamas to make statements in support of a two-state solution, their own policies are rapidly foreclosing that option. Following Hamas&apos;s accession to the Palestinian Authority, the EU and the US seem more intent on punishing the Palestinians for the results of their exemplary elections than on persuading Israel that peace and security will only materialise through negotiated political accommodation.
    Ostensibly, the US-led decision to cut funding to the PA is designed to penalise Hamas for failing to renounce violence, recognise Israel&apos;s right to exist and publicly commit to previously-signed agreements. But this approach is certain to backfire. One million of the estimated 3.8 million Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories rely on PA salaries for their livelihoods. Impoverishing and embittering our people will not only exacerbate the existing humanitarian predicament, it will likely worsen the security crisis for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

 Haniyeh’s Friday Noon Speech–Many layers of Meaning 
By Rashid A. Shahin, Ma&apos;an News 4/18/2006
     Bethlehem - In his Friday Noon Prayer Speech, Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Ismael Haniyeh, called on the Palestinian people to make olives, thyme and olive oil a staple of their meals, pointing to the strangling economic crisis hovering on the horizon. This crisis was being caused by the suspension of US and EU aid to the Palestinian government and people, in a step that Palestinians view as supporting and backing the Israeli decision to collectively punish Palestinians for democratically electing the Hamas Movement on 25 January 2006.
    Thyme, olive oil and olives, for those who don’t know, is a substantial meal- especially when eaten in the morning, which is when it is most commonly eaten in Palestine. These are the most common components of breakfast in Palestine, and they have great nutritional value.
    The Israeli mass media quoted the speech out of context, and made irresponsible and pathetic comments about it. Had it been the Americans or Europeans who discussed his comments in this way, it might have been understood and accepted by Palestinians, as they may have little knowledge about Palestinians food, meals, or way of life.
    ....Haniyeh placed responsibility for the consequences of any starvation that may occur in Palestine, squarely on the shoulders of countries in the region and those in the International community that support the blockade and suspension of aid to the Palestinian Government. He was warning those behind these decisions to be afraid of the rage, anger and revolt they will awaken in the people if they were hungry and unable to feed their families. He was also warning of terrible reactions from the people if children became sick because of the lack or shortage of food. He was saying, as it is the duty of a Muslim to say“God is a witness, God know that I have informed you.”

 Hamas Being Forced To Collapse 
By Sam Bahour, Electronic Intifada 4/17/2006
     As many predicted, including myself (see The Third Intifada), the newly elected Palestinian government led by Hamas has already started to show an impressive level of pragmatism, however, Israel and the U.S. seem to not be interested. As a matter of fact the U.S., in specific, is leading a global campaign to isolate the Palestinian government in such a haphazard way, that they are also causing a troubling level of despair among the average Palestinian citizen as well.
    The Observer (UK) recently reported on Mr. Yihiyeh Musa, a Hamas member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, who said Hamas had moved into a“new era”which did not require suicide attacks. He was quoted as saying,“The suicide bombings happened in an exceptional period and they have now stopped,”he said.“They came to an end as a change of belief.”(April 9, 2006).
    One would think this is good news, especially after the death and destruction such bombing caused. This, one would imagine, should be even better news for Israel and the U.S. given they both have continuously linked such bombings to the reason that the never-ending peace process was unable to actually reach its destination, peace.
    But cautious optimism was not the case. Instead, the U.S. wasted no time in dehumanizing the newly elected Palestinian parliamentarians and cabinet ministers. The war of words has been nearly non-stop since Hamas’victory with all levels of government in D.C. making the case that Hamas can’t change and there is no reason to let them try. Next was a cessation of funding to the Palestinian government and a request for all other countries of the world to follow suit. Then Israel severed all Israeli bank ties with the Palestinian banking system, government related and non-government related. Only yesterday was a U.S. Department of Treasury decree making it illegal for Americans to do business with the Palestinian government. We wait to see tomorrow’s nooses.

 One Blow after the Next 
By Joharah Baker, MIFTAH 4/14/2006
     For over five years, things have been working up to this moment, at least for Israel. While Israeli plans to offer the Palestinians no more than 40 percent of the West Bank as their“state”were originally hatched back in the forties, it has taken this long to actually put blueprints into action, and have the world patting their backs in approval while they do it.
    Everyone knew when Hamas was elected in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections last January that Israel would milk its campaign against“Palestinian terror”for all it’s worth. However, just how easily and quickly the world would fall prey to Israeli propaganda and so blindingly tow Israel’s line was surprising even to the most unfazed in this lopsided conflict.
    The United States, as has been its traditional role since Israel’s inception, was the fervent captain of Israel’s cheerleading squad, fanning the flames of condemnation and accusation against the new Palestinian government. US dollars were promptly cut off from the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas government was diplomatically shunned by anything officially American.
    The European Union was not far behind. Just last week the EU announced it would freeze all funding to the nascent Palestinian government under Hamas until the latter renounced terrorism and recognized Israel’s right to exist. Already, two major sources of funding right down the drain before Hamas has even had time to lift its head, before being able to bounce back from the euphoria of electoral victory.

 Who is behind &quot;Al Qaeda in Iraq&quot;? Pentagon acknowledges fabricating a &quot;Zarqawi Legend&quot; 
By Michel Chossudovsky, Uruknet/GlobalResearch 4/18/2006
      An internal document produced by U.S. military headquarters in Iraq, states that &quot;the Zarqawi PSYOP program is the most successful information campaign to date.&quot; 
    Abu Musab Al Zarqawi has been presented both by the Bush administration and the Western media as the mastermind behind the &quot;insurgency&quot; in Iraq, allegedly responsible for the massacres of Iraqi civilians.
    Zarqawi is the outside enemy of America. The Bush administration in official statements, including presidential speeches, national security documents, etc. has repeatedly pointed to the need to &quot;go after&quot; Abu Musab Al Zarqawi and Osama bin Laden.
    ...In an unusual twist, the Washington Post in a recent article, has acknowledged that the role of Zarqawi had been deliberately &quot;magnified&quot; by the Pentagon with a view to galvanizing public support for the US-UK led &quot;war on terrorism&quot;:
    &quot;The Zarqawi campaign is discussed in several of the internal military documents. &quot;Villainize Zarqawi/leverage xenophobia response,&quot; one U.S. military briefing from 2004 stated. It listed three methods: &quot;Media operations,&quot; &quot;Special Ops (626)&quot; (a reference to Task Force 626, an elite U.S. military unit assigned primarily to hunt in Iraq for senior officials in Hussein&apos;s government) and &quot;PSYOP,&quot; the U.S. military term for propaganda work...&quot; (WP. 10 April 2006)
    The military&apos;s propaganda program, according to the Washington Post, has &quot;largely been aimed at Iraqis, but seems to have spilled over into the U.S. media. One briefing slide about U.S. &quot;strategic communications&quot; in Iraq, prepared for Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top U.S. commander in Iraq, describes the &quot;home audience&quot; as one of six major targets of the American side of the war.&quot; (WP, op cit.)

 Whats mine is mind 
By Chris Brown, Electronic Intifada 4/18/2006
     [Al Fawwar, Hebron] &quot;But I don&apos;t know what my parent&apos;s village looks like,&quot; said Hammad, a young, energetic Palestinian boy who lives in Al Fawwar Refugee camp located near Hebron.
    I came to the camp at the invitation of a friend from The British Council to do a workshop on playwriting. Hammad along with 17 other young boys gathered at the cultural center to participate.
    I told the children about my own exposure to theatre and the power of it. Especially, protest theatre. Growing up in Apartheid South Africa, I could never go to the White areas to see productions. However, a man who performed all over the Cape Province, in various townships and squatter camps happened to be in our township.
    The theatre that he performed in wasn&apos;t a theatre at all; three long folding tables served as the stage. Several paraffin lamps lit the stage and a single chair served as the prop. But it would be all he needed. I sat amazed as he made various characters come to life by contorting his face, or changing his voice.
    Afterwards, I approached him, along with my sister. I waited for him to receive the well-earned thanks that he earned. He looked down at me, sweat pouring off his face, &quot;Excuse me sir,&quot; I said softly. &quot;How were you able to do all the things you just did?&quot; He looked on at me with a huge grin. Pointing to his head he spoke, &quot;Up here I can create whatever I want. Any character, any world, the sky is the limit!&quot;

 Romantic moments under artillery 
By Sami Abu Salem, Electronic Intifada 4/18/2006
     GAZA—The charming fragrance of lemon filled the area when my wife and I were on the roof enjoying the warm breeze last night in Jabalia Refugee Camp, north of Gaza.
    My wife, Suha, was happy with the scene of the moon in the middle of the partially cloudy sky and the aura of sanctity.
    Suha&apos;s eyes were glittering and her beautiful smile was shining in the middle of darkness. We were chatting and exchanging jokes. The innocent laughs of my wife added a special taste to the romantic moment.
    In my inner feeling I paved the way to spend a very warm night with my wife. Suddenly, the explosions literally rocked the ground of my apartment building. The Israeli artillery shot tens of rockets on &quot;unoccupied areas!&quot;
    Suha was so terrified. Horror and fear replaced the brightness of her face. She asked me to go downstairs. I tried to calm her down by claiming that the bombs hit &quot;unoccupied areas.&quot;
    &quot;No, They (the Israeli artillery) target houses and buildings, two days ago they killed a child girl (Hadeel Ghaben) and all of her family were wounded,&quot; she said while trembling.
    We went downstairs to our apartment. Not to resume our romantic moments, but to follow up news through local radio stations. But the electric power was cut off.
    Our apartment turned into a very horrible cottage. Very dark, the double- thuds of artillery increasing in number and intensity.
