The Importance of Restaurant Table Sizing and Layout
 Posted: Sep 26, 2011 |Comments: 0 | 
One of the most crucial parts of restaurant design is the sizing and layout of the restaurant tables. An optimal layout of table sizes and shapes will allow the most customers to be seated as quickly as possible. This means more revenue being generated by the restaurant each and every day. However, this does not mean fitting as many 30&quot; by 48&quot; tables as possible in the restaurant. There are many other layout factors to consider besides the seating capacity. First, there are many restaurant regulations such as aisle width that vary from state to state, check with your local laws and make sure your restaurant abides by these regulations. Do not compromise the safety of your restaurant to fit a few more tables. Second, you need to consider the operations of the restaurant, you want waiters and waitresses to be able to quickly bring food and drinks to the Restaurant tables with a lower risk of accidents. You also want busboys to be able to get in and out when clearing off tables. Last but not least is the ambience of the restaurant. This depends on your goal and can greatly affect the layout of your restaurant tables. Believe it or not, you can control the mood and comfort of your customers through your table layout.

In general there is an inverse relationship between more restaurant tables and more comfort. If you have a few large tables spaced far apart in your restaurant, your customers will most likely be very comfortable. However, you may not be so comfortable with your profits because they will be decreasing from the low capacity. Imagine a restaurant with only a few large tables in it. When a few separate couples come in for a romantic dinner it is quickly at full capacity! The best layout for a high end restaurant is to have a mix of small restaurant tables with a few separate &quot;VIP&quot; areas for large tables. With this layout you get a good balance of maximizing capacity, providing accommodations for large and small groups, and also enhance the ambiance of your restaurant with the grander VIP areas. Before you know it, actual VIPs will be reserving those tables weeks in advance. However, this may not be ideal for other types of restaurants. A popular fast food restaurant may actually want many small square tables as circular tables take up more space and seat less people. A café may actually want to put tables closer together to purposely make the place more uncomfortable since the owner would prefer people to make a purchase and not stay for too long. Also, some restaurants are known for family style meals such as Chinese restaurants and pizza-themed restaurants. These restaurants need more table space to share dishes and must take this into account when selecting the restaurant table sizes and layout.
