 Tweet Home » Restaurants »Blue Room Restaurant 
Blue Room is Mombasa’s most famous landmark restaurant located along Haile Selassie Road. It was established in 1952 and is famous for its bhajias, tea and BR ice cream.

It began as a small fast food restaurant. 10 years later, in 1962, Blue Room began manufacturing ice cream and started an ice cream parlour and ice cream manufacturing plant beside the restaurant.

Through the years, Blue Room underwent numerous minor expansions and renovations. But in 1992 the whole site was practically rebuilt. Before 1992, the seating capacity was roughly 40 people. Today it seats over 140 people, making it one of the largest restaurants in the city.

In April 2001, a Cyber Café was introduced at the main location on Haile Selassie Road, offering Internet Access, MultiPlayer Gaming, Photocopying, fax and other such services.

The menu consists of over 65 items, including a variety of Pizzas and Hamburgers, Calzones, Submarines, Steak, Chicken, Fish, Samosas, Bhajias, Fresh Fruit Juices, Milk Shakes, Faluda, Cappuccino, Cakes, Tarts, Croissants–all using traditional recipes. Even Hamburger buns and Pizza Dough are prepared in-house. All water used to prepare food and ice cream is filtered through an ultra-violet (UV) filter to ensure quality hygiene.

You can also order from the extensive menu or ask the restaurant to develop a personalised menu for you. The food will have be available for pick-up or delivery just in time for your function.
