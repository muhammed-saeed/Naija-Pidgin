 I would highly recommend Restaurant Marketing 
 Ideas 

&quot;Over the past few years 
 my partner and I have been involved in running a restaurant and then a 
 cafe. While we both worked very hard and improved both business, I was 
 always thinking,&quot;Is this the best way to be doing this&quot;,&quot;Is there 
 more efficient ways, better outcomes to be had, where is my next new 
 customer?&quot;The information and ideas always gave me a feeling that my 
 business was moving forward and made me feel confident that we can 
 achieve our goals. I would highly recommend Restaurant Marketing Ideas 
 to anyone in the hospitality industry&quot;.

This is the same restaurant toolkit 100&apos;s of our customers have used to 
 increase their restaurant and cafe sales day after day and week after 
 week. Our 
 customers have no special skills and come from lots of different 
 hospitality businesses like cafes, caterers, restaurants, kiosks, 
 hotels and clubs.

Prior to using and implementing our results orientated marketing systems a 
 lot of our customers experienced some of the same problems. And it is 
 those same problems you are probably experiencing right now in your 
 business...     
 
Do you have some of these problems? 

 Have you ever 
 wondered why some restaurants, cafe or hotels seem to do better than others 
 regardless of economic conditions? 

 Why some 
 restaurant and cafe businesses are constantly busy all of the time and why they 
 get new customers all the time? 

 How to implement better ways 
 to run your restaurant to 
 make more sales and profit? 

 Research has shown that 89% of 
 restaurant and cafe businesses fail in the first 5 years of starting? 

 How come you can&apos;t explain why 
 your business isn&apos;t growing as fast as you want it to, and you have tried 
 lots of stuff? 

 Why your venue is bleeding 
 customers day after day, year after year and you don&apos;t know how to stop the attrition that&apos;s costing you a fortune, and you probably don&apos;t even know it&apos;s happening? 

 Why your promotions are just not 
 producing the results you desire, if you are using any at all? 

Why you don&apos;t get enough time off to spend with your family or friends? 

 Why the profits (or lack 
 there of) 
 in your business just don&apos;t represent the amount of hours you spend in 
 your business? 

 Why you don&apos;t have a defined 
 plan of action to address the direction of the business and the business 
 seems to own you and not the other way around? 

 One of the biggest problems in the hospitality industry is that you never have 
 time to develop a comprehensive restaurant marketing system that will deliver results 
 all of the time. You are too tied up in the 
 day to day operations of your business as you are working in it not 
 working on it. Don&apos;t you wish you could have a 
 cost effective marketing toolkit that delivers results?

 I know you may have some concerns...

 after all who am I to be giving YOU marketing advice? 

And more importantly how do you trust what I am saying to you about 
 marketing your restaurant or cafe?
  

 Well Let Me Start Here... 
  
     
 Hi there... I am the the creator of Restaurant Marketing Ideas . I am a 37 
 year old hospitality marketing professional, I have owned and managed some 
 of the country&apos;s most successful cafes, restaurants and 
 hotels and I have been involved in the hospitality industry all my life as 
 I am a 2nd generation hotelier.     
 I currently lead a team of 
 
 marketing and hospitality business 
 development consultants that help other business owners in the hospitality 
 industry grow and systemise their businesses.

 My company works with clients just like YOU that have hospitality businesses from 
 from a small corner cafe up to a major hotel chain. 

I t rained 
 at one of the Worlds finest Hotel Management Schools where I have 
 acquired both Swiss and Australian Hotel Management qualifications and I have been awarded over 9 regional, state and national hospitality awards in the past 10 years. These awards include winning 
 4 state and national hospitality marketing awards . I was 
 instrumental in winning one of the country&apos;s 
 most sort after awards &quot;The best marketed hotel&quot; 2 years running.

 

 I ha ve  been 
 in control of over 20 food and beverage establishments over the last 10 
 years and ha ve project managed over 12 major food and beverage re-developments and hotel 
 openings. Over this time the 
 revenues I have generated is well in excess of $26 million dollars. 

 I have managed to operate and grow some of the most profitable hospitality 
 businesses in the country . I also 
 spend time as one of the countries leading Hospitality marketing speakers, delivering presentations at 
 National hospitality exhibitions and trade shows and I will be releasing my book about marketing for the hospitality industry in 
 June 2007. 
     
 
 And in those 10 years here&apos;s what I found.. 
 
When I first started helping hospitality business owners around 6 years 
 ago I didn&apos;t realize how many ingrown problems there were in the industry. 
 When I had my own hotels and restaurant I was experiencing the same feelings and emotions 
 as you do right now so that&apos;s when I sat down to design this restaurant 
 marketing package. I 
 took all the things that worked from my previous businesses and designed 
 this marketing package so it can work for you.

Restaurant Marketing Ideas is not just another information product! in 
 fact it is very far from just a couple of pages of writing which tells you 
 how to increase your hospitality businesses sales, it provides you the 
 simple steps and all the marketing promotional templates you will ever need. This powerful 
 
 marketing toolkit tells you what to do and then provides the tools 
 and templates to implement into your business. 

 Restaurant Marketing Ideas is a powerful 
 restaurant and cafe marketing tool kit to help you solve your 
 promotion problems, systemise your marketing promotions and 
 provide an easy solution for what would take you 1000&apos;s of hours and 
 $1000&apos;s to 
 compile, test, measure and implement. 

 Not only do you receive marketing promotional templates you also get a 
 comprehensive 224 page e-book explaining restaurant and cafe marketing in 
 detail. But that&apos;s not all... you also receive a 44 page quick start guide to get you started, 
 today.

In case you are 
 skeptical (I can respect your opinion) so... let me tell you what my 
 restaurant marketing toolkit is NOT.   
 
Just in case you have been taken before on other restaurant or cafe 
 marketing products and they didn&apos;t quite come up to scratch then this is what my marketing toolkit is NOT : 

 It is NOT 
 some old marketing program from the 90&apos;s with out of date 
 promotions...     It is NOT a 
 toolkit where you need special software programs or computer skills...     It is NOT a 
 toolkit where you need previous marketing experience...     It is NOT 
 the type of marketing that requires you to have a lot of money to get started...     It is NOT a 
 system that requires a lot of time to implement... 

      
 Further to that... 

 You can be 
 up and running in ONLY 3 hours with some of my targeted 
 marketing promotions. All of the marketing promotions have already been 
 designed for you so all you have to do is drop in your logo and 
 details and BANG... your promotion is done     It can be 
 used for any type of hospitality business including 
 restaurants, cafes, kiosks, caterers, hotels, deli&apos;s and function 
 centres. This promotions will work for any type of hospitality 
 business     You can be in any country of the 
 world because all of my marketing promotion and strategies 
 can be adapted to any market around the world. So you can have a 
 restaurant in any country and this toolkit will work for you over and 
 over again     It is cost 
 effective so you don&apos;t need to have a big budget to get 
 started, a lot of the restaurant and cafe promotions won&apos;t cost you a cent to get started. 
 All of the promotions are cost effective... no big budget campaigns 
 here     You WILL save 
 lots of time by using all the pre drafted promotion templates 
 and forms. Your time is precious so we have done all the work for you 
 so just arrange the template and print and you are done 

      
 I will explain to you in 
 great detail
what you need to do... (the strategy)

...and then I will give you some of the pre made marketing tools for you to profit from your 
 marketing efforts... (the action)

 service initiatives like the VIP card program... you have 3 to choose 
 from.

I want you to feel absolutely certain there is no way you can&quot;get 
 taken&quot;. After all, I am a respected consultant in the hospitality

 now: 
 
&quot;I&apos;ve got to be crazy not to get in on this! Heck the 
 bonuses alone are worth the cost of the product and they&apos;re free even if I
