Can your employer deduct Credit Card processing fees from your pay?
 I suppose a little more information is in order here. To begin with I am asking on behalf of my girlfriend and not myself. She is a server at a local fast food/restaurant place. This company is shady. Constant wage fluctuations and deductions for random things with almost no prior notification etc.

At any rate. She went into work this morning and was informed that the Processing fees for customers paying by credit card will be taken out of the Servers credit card tip if one was left. If none were left it would come automatically out of her pay check. It is only a 2% charge, but I am certain that will eventually add up.

I am curious if this is legal or not, and if it is legal where could I find the appropriate information that touches specifically on this issue.

 Making a note for possible trolls. She has been looking for another job, but the unemployment rate where we live is 18.9% right now. You&apos;re considered lucky if you work for McDonalds cleaning toilets.

 Look under chapter 30 in the handbook for DOL examiners. It has to be only the portion of credit card processing that pertains to the tip. It also explains the fluctuation in wages due to tip income. They can&apos;t charge 2% if no tip was left.

 &quot;Processing fees for customers paying by credit card will be taken out of the Servers credit card tip if one was left.&quot;

This is legal for the TIP ONLY. The restaurant cannot pass the processing fee for the cost of the meal, taxes etc on to the server.

As for wge fluctuations, the laws regarding wages for tip employees are somewhat different than&quot;normal&quot;employees. Some states require the restaurant to adjust the wages so the combined wages and reported tips at least equal&quot;normal&quot;minimum wge.

 you probably need to check with your state labor board, but my experience tells me this is illegal
the server did not ask the people to use a credit card, it is not within the server&apos;s job or function, it is a cost of doing business for the employer

 In my state, California, the labor commissioner would be all over an employer who was doing this. Bank fees are a cost of doing business for the employer. The employee is entitled all their tips. Yours may be the same.
