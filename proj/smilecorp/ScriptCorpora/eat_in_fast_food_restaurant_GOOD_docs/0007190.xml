 Touchscreens to order fast food 

By Mark Frauenfelder at 8:45 pm Tuesday, Feb 21
 Abir Majumdar says: &quot;I went to one of those Taco Bell/KFC hybrids in Morrisville, NC and all the ordering was done through the gigantic touchscreens. No humans take orders there. You go to the machines and you&apos;re presented by an animated Colonel and talking taco. Then you put in an order as if you were at amazon. You can pay with cash and credit card.&quot;
