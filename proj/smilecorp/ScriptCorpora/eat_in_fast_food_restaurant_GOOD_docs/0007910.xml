&quot;The election ads and the phone calls!!! I will be so glad when this is over. ALL of the candidates have lied about each other. None of them deserve our votes. Maybe I should write in Santa Claus&quot;

&quot;the way people treat police officers they are people too and they have a job to do next time you see a officer tell him or her thank you &quot;

&quot;stupid people and believe me there is alot of them out there&quot;

&quot;As much as it seems unfair that celebrities make more than a teacher or fireman, it is nothing more than supply vs demand. We demand celebrities more than we do those others. In order for teachers and fireman to make more money, you will need to cough up much more in taxes. The problem there is the entire economy gets hurt when people have less money in their pocket from paying high taxes and the question you must ask is by paying more to a fireman or teacher what will the public get out of it in return? They serve our needs, and higher pay should translate into better performance and increased production. Not easy to do with civil servants since their jobs do not rely on how much consumers spend on their product or service. We would not want to set more homes on fire to justify a $10K raise to fireman. I think people who choose those careers do so because they love it. Money is not a major concern. If it were they would never do it. &quot;

 ML, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I agree totally. I think that doctors, teachers, and fireman, you know, people who help the world should be paid more and entertainers should make less. My gosh they are treated like gods! Who cares who is married to who? Why can I not look at a magazine or go online without seeing 400 celebrities? I am tired how they are praised. I am also tired of the actors who can&apos;t act making millions a scene beause they are cute. Heck even some aren&apos;t cute, Kirsten Dunst!&quot;

 kE, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY   |   



 


&quot;PD, you&apos;re right on with Hollywood and actors, actually, most are drop outs. However, I think athletes fit into the same category when it comes to salaries. They&apos;re all overpaid. Since all these types are so liberal and vote accordingly, put them in the 60-70% tax bracket, and leave the rest of us the hell alone.&quot;

 TX, ,   |   



 


&quot;The thing that bothers me is the fact that so many of the celebrities that you see on the front covers of the trash magazines when your in the line at the grocery store are also some of the highest paid. This country has real problems and it is a shame that there are people working hard everyday to earn a living to barely support their families and then you have those who make the millions of dollars that they make to do very little. I know that they act in movies or on television but their jobs are no harder then everyday working class people. The fact that they make so much money is a shame. How do people think that one man deserves so much for getting out of bed and brushing teeth then another man does for going out here and digging a ditch or driving a truck. Everyday working people should think about this when their out in the work place working 9 to 5 (if your lucky!) before going out and spening the money you had to work so hard for just to line the pockets of those who are truly way over paid. The quality of the actors that you have now days is so poor for the most part they cant really believe their worth what they get. Then on top of that people want to think that these actors have so much knowledge and that they are so smart who are passing out this great advice on everything from raising children to politics and the fact is their are not very smart. If you really think that they know what there talking about listen close. Most of them dont have alot of everyday good old fashion smarts. Just because they have money it doesnt make them smart and it sure doesnt make them good people.&quot;

&quot;Way to go DJ. Ohio also could not recognize the anti christ, a drunk or someone who also bankrupped FHA either.&quot;

&quot;a clothing company here in ky called Attus Apparel that sells polo shirts with the middle finger on the chest. how inappropriate and disrespectful. thats the last thing our children need.&quot;

&quot;A guy like Ron Paul speaks the truth and is more Patriotic than all the other Republican candidates and is censored and marginalized at...we are doomed.&quot;

&quot;People from Ohio commenting on presidential elections. Ohio is the reason we are still dealing with this failed administration. Thanks a lot Ohio!&quot;

&quot;The way Hillary talks about socialism. I really hope she doesn&apos;t get elected.&quot;

 SC, Laura, Ohio   |   



 


&quot;Thank you, ED. Some rare tolerance and sense on this page...&quot;

 KH, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;People who lack patience, tolerance and acceptance in regards to the lives and choices of others. Acceptance is the solution to many of the world&apos;s problems, and in my experience the people who are the least tolerant are usually more unhappy with themselves and their own situation than whatever it is they find unacceptable about another person.&quot;

 ED, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;Hillary Clinton is running for President of this great country. I believe she is not a legit or able candidate because her character is no different than her husband who is a cheat, liar and criminal I think she proved this with her interview with Talk Magazine. Hillary told the interviewer that she knew all along about Bills philandering and lying on the witness stand. She had to know the impeachment charges , were true. Instead she lied and misdirected by vehemently blaming his actions on a right-wing conspiracy. Her law partner Hubbell had been scheduled to go on trial starting Aug. -.1999 on a 15count indictment that charged he lied to conceal the work he and Mrs. Clinton performed on the failed Arkansas land development called Castle Grande. This action was squashed by Hubble pleading guilty therefiore Hillary did not havee testify. Who knows what lying and cheating would have been disclosed at the trial if Hubble had not pleaded guilty. With her background how in the worlld can this country afford another lying presudebt? If we think we are in trrouble with terrorism all we need is another Clinton in control of this country.&quot;

&quot;KD- throwing cigarette butts on the ground is considered litering. The LFUCG set up a web page where you can report littering from car windows. You enter the plate #&apos;s and the city sends a warning letter of the $500.00 fine to the owner. I am a smoker and I believe smokers do abuse allot of things. I am a person who hates any kind of litter and will admit I have reported a few vehicles. I always put my cigarettes out in my cars ash tray (thats what it there for!!) why can&apos;t others do the same? I just went hiking at Red River Gorge and was amazed at all the cigarettes butts on the trails, I came to the conclusion that I&apos;m probably the only smoker who thought to bring a half-full water bottle in my back-pack so I could dispose of them later! To all the people who stereotype smokers, I just want to say there are respectful smokers out there, not many but some!! I agree with the smoking ban, I mean who wants to eat at a table next to an inconsiderate smoker! Not to mention children are in public places and should not be exposed to 2nd hand smoke,&amp;niether should anyone who doesn&apos;t smoke! But yeah throwing the cigareete out the window on the ground is littering and should be reported, Lexington has too much trash on the streets as it is!&quot;

 HL, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;amazing - people are ticked off about smoking but Rosie gets away with her mean spirited opinions and pagan lifestyle - she should go to a Muslin country where they shoot &quot;gay&apos;s&quot;, not to mention her horrible comment that if &quot;men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament&quot;.....disgusting..&quot;

 sm, Fort Collins, CO   |   



 


&quot;the fact that smokers throw their ciagarette butts on the ground...why is that not considered trash? It&apos;s litter and should be treated as such!&quot;

 KD, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;People with too many opinions! I am happy today is Friday everyone have a wonderful weekend!&quot;

&quot;That I should have bought gas on the 15th (yesterday) b/c it went up to $3.19 today!&quot;

&quot;If I move to France, I&apos;m expected to learn the French language. If I move to Thailand, I&apos;m expected to learn Thai. If I move to Mexico, I&apos;m expected to learn Spanish. So why can&apos;t those who are from another country and living here (mostly illegally) learn the English language???&quot;

 HM, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;The lack of consideration for others, uncivilized people [there are allot of these in Lexington], the teens who are having kids that have no idea how to raise them so they are nothing but troublemakers with fowl mouths, oblivious drivers, rude people in general, litter bugs, gas prices, the Lexington Urban County Gov. lack of maintaining roads. Well i could go on forever but that seems to do it for now!!&quot;

 LB, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Just as someone has the &quot;right&quot; to smoke. I have the right to breathe. And my right to breathe is a matter of life and death, smoking isn&apos;t.&quot;

&quot;You know what really ticks me off, PEOPLE THAT THINK THEY HAVE A CLUE AND DON&apos;T EVEN COME CLOSE TO HAVING A CLUE!! YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE DON&apos;T YOU!!!!&quot;

 TT, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY   |   



 


&quot;I won&apos;t be buying GAS on MAY 15. If the people don&apos;t put a stop to it. Gas prices are going to keep going up. I mean look we keep paying for it so they&apos;re just going to keep making up excuses for it to be that high then reporting thier 15 billion or whatever profits. Please just try to not to buy gas on the 15th of May&quot;

 tj, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Doctors who take forever to get with you. My dad just found out he has cancer. And its been a month befoe could get him in to see him. Is that normal. Its like they came in and said&quot; hi you have cancer and this is the type, go look it up on the internet and will try to get you in sometime &quot;. Why should people have to go threw that.&quot;

&quot;THE HORRIBLY RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE, ALWAYS-IN-A-HURRY DRIVERS IN THIS RIDICULOUS TOWN&quot;

 PD, LEXINGTON, KY   |   



 


&quot;Politicians, ALL of them reguardless of what party they are. Im tired of their ads already. Its like I tell my buddy, you never vote for the best candidate you vote for the person you think will screw you the least!!!&quot;

 ST, Richmond, Ky.   |   



 


&quot;People who drive too close on the interstate! Just because the speed limit is going up does not mean the stupidity level needs to. Kentucky needs to bring drivers Ed back to high school!&quot;

 KK, Nicholasville, KY   |   



 


&quot;Yes, I am one of those who have received the email.&quot;Don&apos;t buy gas on the 15 th. I think we all should do it though for the heck of it. Just to see at least what would happen in Lexington alone. It bothers me that from one side of town to the other the difference. Or another county. I drive many miles everyday, multicounty and I can&apos;t believe so many different prices. Somethings up, and its going to someones pocket. So lets NOT BUY GAS ON MAY 15 TH, AND JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS!!!!!!&quot;

 mp, lEXINGTON, KY   |   



 


&quot;Is anyone else being spammed as much on insight as I am. What&apos;s up?, Its outof control. Its happenening on email addresses I don&apos;t even use, now insight obviously????&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m ticked off at the weather. Why is it that every year the Derby is sandwiched between great weather while the whole world is forced to watch Kentucky&apos;s Seattle-style weather during the event!&quot;

 WJ, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Couldn&apos;t agree more, SJ. I have the same problem with my outgoing email. It has been this way for weeks now.&quot;

 AT, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;What&apos;s ticking me off is the inconsistency of Insight&apos;s SMTP Mail Server - have they lost all concept of technology!? WAKE UP!&quot;

 SJ, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I&apos;m tired of people complaining about smokers!!! Everyone has the right to smoke or not. The government already took the ability to smoke inside, isn&apos;t that enough? They can&apos;t control what we do outside.&quot;

 jw, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;All these stinking phone books are ticking me off! Why can&apos;t we go back to having one provider? You can&apos;t keep one and throw the rest away because not all the books have all the numbers, plus they take up too much space! (Actually, since this is my only gripe - life is good!) B/T/W - NG I won&apos;t be buying gas on the 15th&quot;

 kp, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;All this nonsense on &quot;Dont buy gas on May 15th&quot;. It&apos;s ridiculous - completely unorthodox! What&apos;s really the point - do they really think it&apos;s going to help? It&apos;s more of a fad/chain the having any point! It&apos;s driving me crazy - ppl who really participate need to open their eyes and really - either deal with the gas prices or buy a flippin&apos; Hybrid!&quot;

 NG, Stanton, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;DOGS WITHOUT LEASHES!!! It stinks to walk down the street and worry someone&apos;s dog is going to attack you. Walking with a leash in the owners hand is not the same as attaching it to their collar!!!! Be considerate!!&quot;

 RO, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;Running red lights, drinking and driving, pulling out in front of others while driving, slow drivers in the fast lane and that fact that we have multiple deaths and injuries over the past 2 weeks is what&apos;s really ticking me off.&quot;

 KL, Georgetown, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;TJ, where did you come from? what brought that on? I am just wondering.&quot;

 JT, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;I think that it is a disgrace to our Creator that we put everthing before him; He died for all of us even the sinners that we could have the right to the kingdom of God.&quot;

&quot;Is picking your nose life-threatening?&quot;

 MM, FF, KY   |   



 


&quot;DB, you don&apos;t know what you are talking about! I just put obits in for family members, and they only print what you tell them too! I don&apos;t think that was the H-L&apos;s fault. I know individuals who have taken their own lives and that is not printed.&quot;

 ST, Lex, Ky   |   



 


&quot;People who refuse to embrace the Spanish language. Why are you taking pride in your own ignorance?&quot;

 JJ, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;People who drive recklessly. My life is not your video game.&quot;

 KH, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;I have to agree with TS. Gasoline prices are out of control. I know that it is good for the enviroment, because high price = less driving, but living in the community we live in, it is pretty much impossible to work and not have to drive.&quot;

 NS, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;A reporter in the Herald Leader who inserted a sentence in an obit article that did not need to be there for the peace of mind of the family. The man who died has four children ranging in age from 6 to 16--and they will forever have to go to school and thru life being branded as &apos;that guy who committed suicide&apos;s kids!&apos; Waaaaayyyy too heave a burden for such young people. it is traumatic enough that they lost their dad at such young ages--but to be stigmatized and traumatized by the insertion of &apos;The Fayette County Coroner&apos;s Office said the man took his own life.&apos; is PATHETIC. Selling newspapers is important--protecting lives (Especially innocent childrens&apos; lives--is MORE important....MUCH more important! Were have civility, common sense and decency gone?!&quot;

 DB, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Gasoline prices! The Government is allowing this because the corporation&apos;s capital gains taxes are funding the war!!!&quot;

 TS, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;Slow drivers who think it&apos;s ok to stay in left lane on New Circle, even though everyone is passing them. If your gonna drive slow, JUST GET OVER!&quot;

 DP, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;i&apos;m tired of smoker&apos;s who think they have a &quot;right&quot; to smoke. it&apos;s not a right anymore than picking your nose is. it&apos;s a disgusting, annoying, life-threatening HABIT.&quot;

 lw, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;I am tired of the crossing guard at J.R.Ewan telling parents they can&apos;t park on the corner of the school because it is her spot. no people its not it says car rider drop off and pick up olny. not crossing guard parking... So stop moving.&quot;

 ar, lexington, kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I think that it is a damn shame that there is not one place you can smoke indoors if there was a smoking sign in front of a place and you do not smoke do not enter . its just like tv if you dont like the show change the channel.if employees are aware of a smoking enviroment and the costmers are aware whats the problem.and one mor thing what happened to a owners rights?&quot;

&quot;that Donovan ain&apos;t coming. that sucks. I don&apos;t blame him, though.&quot;

 PT, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;It ticks me off that no one in this town has the guts to stand up against the ILLEGALl ALIEN INVASION. What will it take - having a family member slaughtered by one? If they attack an armed officer, what do you think they will do to you or your family?&quot;

 ST, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;CS- evidently the pro-illegal crowd has nothing to respond to your statement.&quot;

 ST, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;ok - so today it&apos;s reported that in Lexington 4 hispanic men attacked a police officer that had stopped their van for not having a license. Tell me when enough illegality is enough!&quot;

 CS, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;It ticks me off that you can&apos;t even be allowed to capitalize Jesus&apos; name!!!!!!!! Shame on you webmaster!!&quot;

&quot;ICE and local police have been called about the bus, but nothing has been done!! This same bus has been stopped in Nashville on the way to Lexington carrying drugs and guns and yet they won&apos;t even get on and inspect it here. Makes me think somebody is getting an awful lot of money for looking the other way. It&apos;s the Dawahare&apos;s parking lot and if you recall, Richard Dawahare wrote a lengthy op-ed piece bemoaning &quot;their just looking for a better way of life and Jesus and his parents were immigrants.&quot; He neglected to add they were travelling to Bethlehem to be part of a citizen census and to pay their taxes. They were being good CITIZENS and OBEYING the laws. NEWBERRY needs to step up and start dealing with these issues instead of turning a blind eye to the trashing of this city!!!&quot;

 MM, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Hey I have a great idea to facts of the illegals incircling the state of KY., why don&apos;t we the people of the commonwealth host our own protest. March it all the way to Washington and tell&apos;em the way we feel about what really is going on in the state and this counrty, its high time we do what they seem they can do. I&apos;ve read alot of what people there have complained about and I have to agree that it hits the taxe payers the hardest, no matter what you do for a living. I still have the urgancy to move back to my home state from tucson, AZ., and help organize some type of gathering to tell the state and the counrty and the world how we the American citizens of this country feel. I came from Germany and had to lern the English language so what makes mexicans indiferant than the rest of us. To the mexicans, asimilate or go home on the bus back/set a protest where the buses drop them off and get I.N.S., there to check for legal documentation.HOORA&quot;

&quot;JM...You&apos;re exactly right....this &quot;GIMME&quot; mentality is from the Johnson era and is now known as generational &quot;welfare.&quot; The ones that are physically able .......cut their checks off and MAKE THEM WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Oh my God! If there were a &quot;white&quot; ball, you are correct, the entire town would be blasted! It is comical. And all the blacks do is complain about their no-rights! Go figure!&quot;

 PT, Lex, Ky   |   



 


&quot;PS.....if you would have read the other letters concerning the martin luther and black/white inuendos then you might have reason to post a message. i dont need a dictionary as i am very well versed in english as well as a another few languages. thanks for your concern, though.&quot;

 ap, lex, ky   |   



 


&quot;We have laws. Those laws aren&apos;t being enforced. American citizens are tired of being trampled under the boots of the people coming here ILLEGALLY and having the nerve to demand &quot;their rights&quot;. Our students, elderly, veterans and every tax payer suffers the consequences. Only the people that hire &quot;cheap&quot; labor are benefitting. To those people I say, pay all of the medical, school and welfare for those you are using as slave labor and they are ALL YOURS!&quot;

 TG, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;All of the mumbo jumbo about the illegals in KY. Yes, I do agree that it is getting out of control and that our government should at least have a program set up to establish them as citizens if they are going to be here, so that they have to pay the same taxes that we do, and I agree that speaking English should be a prerequisite for entering the states, we should not have to change our language to adapt, they should adapt to our language. But on the other hand we have alot of people who sit on their hind ends at home and don&apos;t or won&apos;t work that can, and do nothing but complain about what the government isn&apos;t doing for them, get out and get a job and do for yourself, quit complaining and make your life what you want of it and then we wouldn&apos;t need illegals to work. My grandparents who have raised tobacco all of their lives used to depend on the same seasonal workers, now those workers think they are too good to work so they are forced to use the only people who will work, which is the illegals. Not everyone is going to make the big bucks, but the important thing is that you are doing for yourself and not depending on someone else to take care of you. If you are able to work, then work, if not, they will continue to come in and take the jobs that Americans won&apos;t do, because we are all waiting for that big break that isn&apos;t going to come unless you make it happen for yourself. So we can&apos;t really complain if you don&apos;t do anything to rectify the situation.&quot;

 JM, Richmond, KY   |   



 


&quot;It&apos;s all about LEGAL vs. ILLEGAL. If you insist upon calling that being racist, then I think you need to get a dictionary. Preferably an ENGLISH one!&quot;

&quot;so it seems we&apos;re still a little racist and bigoted village as opposed to an actual city. How sad, get out your sheets.&quot;

&quot;Hey, at least the majority of African Americans here in Lexington are legal vs. the Hispanic population of which 85% are here illegally by their own admission. And yes, the buses keep coming from Mexico to Gardenside every week bringing more - will our Mayor do anything about this? It sure doesn&apos;t look like it. He&apos;s too concerned about pleasing the horse farmers!!&quot;

 MM, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;MH...Imagine having an AMERICAN CAUCASIAN BALL this weekend, while The African American Ball is being held AGAIN this year. I&apos;d say the biggest part of Lexington would &quot;be burned to the ground.&quot; STRANGE isn&apos;t it????&quot;

 CW, Lex., KY   |   



 


&quot;YES, SPEAK ENGLISH YOU MORONS!&quot;

 KK, Lex, KY   |   



 


&quot;In response to those talking about the MLK flags. Makes me sick! The MLK holiday isn&apos;t that old. The african americans, (that&apos;s what I think they are called this week), raised so much hell about our President&apos;s Day, that MLK got put on the calendar as a holiday.

&quot;Pm, thanks for anwering back civilize. Not always does that happen here on this board. I gotta admit I can see both sides of both parties, I can see some side of programs failing but remember one of the oldest programs ever was created by a Democrat, Social security-FDR. Some of those programs fail due to the cuts that are being made to them. Such as the grants and loan programs. Given though, I can fully understand with some programs there is abuse. I think we watched it all fall in front of our eyes with Katrina the last 2 years. Sometimes our perception of these two parties is the pubs want to keep the rich ...rich and those who are down and out,...down and out. I will always remember this growing up in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s. I can see the point of the white race being forgotten about. Unfortunately, there were others races in most cases blacks nd hispanics who&apos;s only places during times past were be seen and not heard and sit in the back of the bus and fix master his supper. I know times has changed and todays non-minority shouldnt have to suffer for what happened and everyone should be hired based on merit. I&apos;m fine with that, but you cant ignore it or forget about it. This is America, and it is full of several nationalities. I wish we all could learn about each other as a culture fairly and equally in schools. I wish there was a way the concervative and liberal labels would just go away. I wish there was a major third party that could make both sides of the country wake up. It&apos;s too far left and too far right for me. I&apos;m a middle guy. I believe in having a certain level of morals and working hard to get where you need to be. But I also feel if you are working to making something better of your life&amp;this country. Such as college, buying hybrids, volunteering.You should be assisted in some form of way. In the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s There were not many programs that exist now that help peolple attend school. Most of us felt it would always be down to how much was saved for school since our kids were born., Thanks to dems and pubs. There are opportunities to help assist several of us to achived this goal. Again, there are abusers,. The system is working a way on how to correct the matter, i do stand in the financials aid lines over at Bctcs or Uk and see a mixture of students receiving aid to achieve their goals. Hopefully these students will use their gift and give back in time as most Alumni do or run for goverment to help ends wasteful spending. But its all politics...... Politics suck , just ask the current and former mayors.&quot;

&quot;Get used to the Mexican&apos;s invading us! And others I might add. The American people are way too nice. That&apos;s why it took so long to kill Sadam. We should have killed the S.O.B. the first time around when he was killing his own people. The American&apos;s are going to starve themselves to death if they don&apos;t stop the give-aways! That&apos;s why we are waiting for doctor&apos;s appointments so long, even if you have health insurance! It is called the Healthcare Reform! Thanks to Mrs. Hillary Clinton. AND.....don&apos;t be surprised if she is our next President. Makes me sick to my stomach! Wake up America!&quot;

&quot;To DJ - Yes, the problem with illegal immigration is getting progressively worse. Whether you are talking about the horse farmers, agric. farmers, construction companies, etc. that may be addicted to cheap labor or the politicians that pander to the big contributors or hopes of a new &quot;voting base&quot;, be they illegitimate, no one with the authority to do anything about rectifying this problem is choosing to address this issue. As long as people refuse to see that it isn&apos;t a racist issue, but rather the importance of rule of law, most citizens won&apos;t voice their disdain for the antics of politicians or employers. Yes, it&apos;s getting worse, freebies abound like there are no limits, trash is piling up along the roads, the maternity wards are seeing an ever increasing population of illegals desperate to birth in the U.S. and get a free ride (the more the better) since it is obvious the U.S. &quot;owes them since they work so cheaply&quot;, crime is up although the majority of news agencies refuse to expose the roots of the problem, gangs and their members are growing and drugs are becoming ever more prevalent. Please people, wake up and start addressing these problems with your legislators, mayor, employers, etc. Don&apos;t hire or patronize from those that employ ILLEGALS. Make it known that this is not acceptable in America!!!! Cut off the jobs, the governmental freebies, and deport those currently here illegally with threat of long-term incarcerations upon re-entry to this country. It&apos;s time WE TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK!!!! If you&apos;re ticked off, talk to your friends and neighbors about the stats, 12 murdered per day, 13 killed per day for vehicular homicide and 8 children abused daily by ILLEGAL ALIENS in the U.S.!!!!! These figures far outweigh the numbers of those soldiers killed in Iraq. Bush says he&apos;s concerned about our country&apos;s security, yet we are victims everyday by those coming here ILLEGALLY and then having the NERVE to PROTEST for their RIGHTS. What rights?!!! The only right they should be given is the right to return to theirhome country unless they choose to be here legally. Multiple offenders will be prosecuted. The heck with the ACLU!!!! Americans, Kentuckians, get fired up and voice your outrage!!! If not, our children and future generations will have every right to point the finger at YOU for the downfall of this country to FOREIGN INVADERS!!!!!!!!!! To your question - it&apos;s getting worse every where. Only places like Hazelton, PA that has local govt. concerned about this issue many survive.&quot;

&quot;GW.....Thanks for your comments, however, most of the grants, scholarships, etc., seem to be more favorable to minorities, not just blacks, but Mexican, Asian, Oriental, etc. I think it&apos;s pretty obvious since the colleges have dumbed down requirements to accommodate these minorities....I&apos;m NOT saying this is always the case, but it&apos;s pretty well documented by now. This country seems to have forgotten there&apos;s a white population out there also, wanting an education and working their butts off to get one. The one thing that separates the Democrats from the Republicans is.........the Republicans believe in people working hard to support themselves and getting ahead, this is a CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY after all.......the Democrats want to take all your hard earned money and give it primarily to those that DON&apos;T and WON&apos;T WORK, through taxes..... like a SOCIALISTIC SOCIETY. This IS NOT A SOCIALIST COUNTRY (as long as we can keep Hillary out) and should NOT be run like one. When Bush gave a tax cut a couple years ago.............everyone I know received $300 checks, those who made anywhere from $30,000 a year to over $100,000...............BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED IT A TAX CUT FOR THE RICH......from the first day and still are. Do you call those income levels RICH, I certainly don&apos;t??? BUT......DEMOCRATS want every dime you make to give to &quot;their failing social programs, it&apos;s how they get their votes.&quot; Wait until you finish college and see how anxious you are for them to tax you to death...it gets mighty OLD, plus it makes people DEPENDENT ON OTHERS...........which is EXACTLY what the dems want, DEPENDENCY. People fail to realize with all these handouts...........WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE GOVERNMENT, that&apos;s where the money is coming from, NOT the DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU!!!!!! GOOD LUCK WITH COLLEGE, KIDS, AND A NEW CAREER. GOD BLESS YOU.&quot;

&quot;Pm=Sounds like your husband is a hard worker and cares alot for hiis daughter to go to school. Your daughter seems also to be very hard working and learning. Please dont think that those who are just sent automatically to school for free are just minorities. You may find alot of non-minorities (whites) in the welfare liine if you just stop by and look. Heck, goto the unemployment line as well. there are programs out there that help people of all races. There are also scholarships available out there that some ppl didnt know existed. Some of these scholarships were created by people of various races and both sexes who struggle just like your daughter to get through school. Just ike there are some colleges that cater to just women, there are scholarships in honor of female graduates who have made a name for themself that offer money to women. College is never easy for anyone. Any any parent who&apos;s kid goes to school out of state. But please do your research. Please dont blame the &quot;free ride&quot; on the new Democrat administration when it was the Bush Administration that cut school tuition grants such as the &quot;Pell&quot; and raise interest rates on student loans that your daugghter and husband are working to pay back now. For everyone there are options. I&apos;,m a student as well.. work full time and overtime when required. and raise my children. I do what I can with what I have, The company I work for does offer tuition reimburement. Heck, I believe Uk any fulltime employee of Uk have their classes paid for and can take off to attend classes. I hope things work out for your family. I know it seems hard, Its a struggle for everyone. I suppose what I sometimes hate about comments of this board is when it sounds like people just go by just one thing they hear and then they run with it without hearing both sides of the issue or really seeking out to understand those who they dont know. Thanks for your time&quot;

&quot;It burns me up that my husband and my daughter both worked the entire time they went to college...she having graduated just recently, with thousands of dollars in school loans to repay, and according to The Herald Leader today, the Univ. of Lou. as well as UK will start sending yet more low income kids.......... to college TOTALLY FREE NOW.....AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE of course. As many programs as there&apos;s been for years for low income kids, why now TOTALLY FREE to them? Why should my daughter spend years paying back school loans and have to pay extra taxes so these kids can go free?? With these programs for about 50 years now.....sounds like their parents made NO ATTEMPT to even go to elementary school, let alone college. Seems these are the same people our welfare system has been supporting all these years. I get tired of helping people non stop that REFUSE to help themselves. Will it never end?????????? This is called &quot;Redistribution of the wealth by the Democrats,&quot; I call it downright robbery of the hard working people, like my husband who works 12 hours a day. I would bet you my last bottom dollar 98 percent of these kids are minorities.... I think taxpayers should have a say so over what their money is spent on...ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! This is the same reason we have so many people on the welfare system now, it&apos;s free!! THIS STATE BREEDS DEPENDENCY.&quot;

&quot;PM- I do agree that a great majority of the problems with illegal immigrations cannot be directly linked to McConnell. However, right now he holds a relatively important position as Senate Minority Leader and as such has stated that he is for Comprehensive Immigration reform which we know means Amnesty for those here ILLEGALLY. KK- I agree, people living in this country should be speaking English. Deliberate public use of another language when both parties know English, is an insult. I must say that I disagree with your belief that most of those Hispanic here are here legally. By their own admission, 85% are here ILLEGALLY.&quot;

&quot;McConnell is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. He says he&apos;s concerned about the Social Security System and yet wants to give legal citizenship to those here ILLEGALLY. Well according to an agreement made with Mexico and Bush in 2004, all those here ILLEGALLY that gain legal citizenship will be entitled to SS benefits. Yes, that&apos;s right even if they fraudently used someone else&apos;s SS number. This is what the Senate will do - give citizenship to the ILLEGALS and thus totally bankrupt the SS system right out from under the middle class and those that have been paying in for YEARS. The ILLEGALS would be entitled to receive benefits after 18months work. Normal AMERICANS are required to work 10 years to receive these benefits. What is right about this? NOTHING!!!!! Please call McConnells office and let him know to back off this. He has a very powerful position and it&apos;s time he was knocked down a notch and realize he was elected by CITIZENS and NOT ILLEGALS and he needs to stop PANDERING!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;It appears the illegals are going to have to be state controlled and since so many of our policymakers seem to be so &quot;POLITICALLY CORRECT,&quot; maybe we can put it to a vote next election and let the TAXPAYERS DECIDE IF THEY WANT THEIR MONEY SPEND ON ILLEGALS OR NOT. I CERTAINLY DON&apos;T....let&apos;s see if we could get it on the KY ballot, Lord knows WASHINGTON REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING FOR APPROX. 40 YEARS NOW. ENOUGH ALREADY!!

We&apos;re averaging paying $10,000 plus for each child, but APPARENTLY that&apos;s NOT ENOUGH to teach. Most of the illegals invade our schools with parents paying NO taxes, free meals, after school programs, us having to hire ESL teachers for them, on and on and on. It NEVER ends today, MAJORITIES NO LONGER RULE............THEY JUST PAY FOR ALL THE NEW SCHOOLS, etc. the illegals are taking over. I for one find it hard to believe I&apos;m in the US when I go practically anywhere, the mall, Walmart, etc. and see fewer whites than Mexicans.

I suppose some of you just need to be exposed to other cultures to see the other side of things., II will say this, to the person complaining about ppl not respecting ford. I&apos;m sorry but how many days must we mourn for a President who died, Not assasinated in office but died. I&apos;m still burned out from Reagans&apos;s funeral. These news networks just draw it out as long as possible that I change the channel and refuse to watch. Barely anyone spoke about Ford till he died. This guy played the role of &quot; The man who wishes he was never President&quot;. I do plan to apply for a job at federal and state goverments since they tend to give days off over some of the most b,s. holidays. Heck, I say any holiday the goverment gets should be adopted by business around the country, Oh yea, did we pay for Fords, mourning holiday for federal employees.&quot;

&quot;The public school system, especially the elementary schools. I am from Western KY and the difference in the school systems show. Assume the wrong thing, is what I did, I figured Big City, College Town, money spent in the city schools, how comepletely wrong I am. The school districts look like a 5 year old took a crayon to the map and drew what sections of the city went to what ever school just happened to be in the circle. Then to make it even worse The Parents have to deal with the bus garage, the school doesn&apos;t handle &quot;those issues&quot;? Lest not forget where are the sports? Drama, what do the kids not have enough drama in their lives they have to learn more. We already have to help our kids control their attitudes for fear they may say or draw something in the heat of the moment and get expelled. gee wouldn&apos;t it be cheaper for us to put metal detectors instead of expelling kids left and right (no my child has not been expelled) Look at the money you lose with every kid out of school, Umm no child left behind...Maybe the child needs to be heard... Oh yeah teachers don&apos;t get paid to care for the children, but they sure are good at pretending. Here is another antic my kid comes home the other day to tell me his friend didn&apos;t want his vegetables, so my kid asks and proceeds to eat what the other kid was going to throw in the trash. He gets into trouble for it, what does it matter he didn;t steal it, he asked first, it was going in the trash! A month ago my kid tells me he got his head slammed in a locker by a fellow classmate he tried to tell the sub and she disregarded him, then later the VP tells him he has to pay for the damage until my kid tells him what happened and then nothing was ever said or done about the kid who actually did the damage. No one even called me! My kid misses westen KY schools, if it wasn&apos;t for me going to college (EKU) UK sucks..where does the money go not in the looks, WE would be back in Western KY. I am guessing with all the politics homeland here the money doens&apos;t go where it is needed, how sad&quot;

&quot;To the person that believes illegal aliens, their drugs and their weapons shouldn&apos;t be considered a problem, I have one thing to say, &quot;It&apos;s ILLEGAL&quot;. Funny I didn&apos;t mention race, you did. Those who come here illegally could be any race or nationality. It just so happens that our borders are extremely porous and terrorism is also an issue. It&apos;s time Lexingtonians realize that drug cartel are affiliated with many of the issues regarding the illegals. Mexican drugs bring lots of money and crime.

&quot;$948 one time fee for Kentucky Gas. Even though I am going with gas for main heat with a remodel of my house...the gas company charges $948 for NOT to use gas. Even if the line has been abondoned. Wondered if they charged the previous owners also. Go figure.&quot;

&quot;The smoking issue to me is somewhat crazy! The restaurants and some businesses I partially agree with, but the bars is the craziest of all! Makes no sense at all! Before long, you won&apos;t be able to drive your own car without getting a ticket if you are smoking! I also wear a seatbelt, but I don&apos;t think it is right to make people wear them! Getting pretty scary, isn&apos;t it?&quot;

&quot;to the person that made the comment about the illegals that are leaving on the busess from the gardenside plaza and they leave to mexico or where ever they go...and that they carry weapons or what ever they carry...u know they are not the only race in the world to carry weapons or drugs or what ever they carry u should ride the greyhound bus one day because the greyhound workers does not check all luggage so please do not blame on one race when u should look at your own american people!&quot;

&quot;The smoking ban---I&apos;m an ex-smoker but I have no problem if someone wants to light up next to me. This is still a free country isn&apos;t it? They are telling us where and when we can smoke but have no problem bending the rules for the liquor sales on New Year&apos;s Eve and are even considering keeping it in play full time to benefit the economy for Lexington. Someone please tell me that it makes sense to increase the amount of time and days people can sup down the booze and get on the road to kill someone but a person smoking is tabu! What&apos;s the problem, one is just as bad as the other but I haven&apos;t heard of someone getting behind the wheel of a car and driving while smoking and killing anyone. So lay off, if we want to smoke, lets smoke, if we drink, then drink. But put into play a free ride home system if our council is okaying more alcohol sales as a good thing. Once again this is a free country right and we are the tobacco state, how do you think some of us made a living and still do, it&apos;s a little twisted don&apos;t ya think, to cut off the hand that has helped to feed some people in this state. And I&apos;m sure if those that passed the ban look back in there family history and it was here in Kentucky, my guess is they got here due to a great tobacco season.

&quot;I&apos;m ticked off that Lexington public officials allow DAILY arrivals of Mexican buses to Lexington with direct routes from 4 cities in Mexico. These same buses have been stopped in Nashville in route to Lexington and have been found to be carrying not only illegal aliens, but drugs and large weaponry. It&apos;s no wonder they come here - no one is stopping this illegal behavior. Can we expect Newberry to do anything? I have my doubts. Anybody that doesn&apos;t believe, just hang out in the Gardenside shopping center across from Dawahares some Saturday between 12-1PM. You&apos;ll be sure to be entertained by those departing with small packages and being picked up in large SUVs and Hummers.

&quot;FEDERAL HOLIDAY-ANOTHER ONE&quot;

 je, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;People who cut in line at the store and act like nothing is wrong. I hate to say it, but at Garden Ridge this weekend, a lady cut in front of me, hit my cart and actually pushed an elderly lady to get to the front of the express lane they opened in the returns line. I am a very calm and usually reserved person, but she made me snap. I told her how rude it was and how dare she act as if nothing has happened. She still acted bewildered at my comment so I repeated it for others to hear. I usually detest the loud comment makers in stores and generally snub them, but I was one of those idiots Saturday. I try to stay in the holiday spirit, but I was so enraged, I snapped. So to the blonde past her prime in Garden Ridge, I hope you really enjoyed those ghetto party hats you almost disabled granny to get. Hope the trailer park really rang in the New Year with your snazzy glitter hats. HEIFER.&quot;

&quot;I do have to say, I went to the Music City Bowl, you would think that being in a state more Kentuckians would be friendlier. I passed by so many people, Clemson people were friendly. Out of state people were friendlier, Yes you could tell the ones there who were there for the true blue of Kentucky Football, but those there that well it was the Social thing to do. Lets be seen with our uppity, Hey in my book, we all should be be saying to each other there, Look at those Cats, Hey, Kentucky, or anything, that would have produced team spirit. Team spirit for UK was not there like I have seen at the UK games. Perhaps I wasn&apos;t in the right section, but I would have given anything to have been. For all those empty seats that I saw, or those that I saw leaving at the end of the 3rd quarter, please let me have your 70.00 tickets so that myself, and other devoted UK FANS can truly enjoy the game. This truly makes me mad. You all should have your tickets taken from you.&quot;

&quot;HB.....I agree the driving in Lexington has continued downhill....however, you must realize we&apos;re letting thousands of illegals into our country on a weekly basis......most of these 3rd. world countries do not teach driving, therefore, they just learn on their own, plus the fact, most do not read nor speak English, making it virtually impossible to read road signs, directions, etc. They have NO license, NO insurance, and HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY&apos;RE DOING!!! STUPID....AREN&apos;T WE...............BUT, the POLITICALLY CORRECT WANT US TO SUPPORT THEM AND FURNISH THEIR MEDICAL CARE........ SO HERE WE ARE!!! Just listen to the politicians for example, and DON&apos;T vote for any who think letting illegals come here is OK. TED KENNEDY commented recently, if we didn&apos;t want &quot;gay marriage and illegals here....we were all bigots!!!! SCREW TED KENNEDY, our country is being DESTROYED.&quot;

&quot;NS- your completely right! I smoke but yeah I&apos;ve got an ashtray in my car, it&apos;s real easy to use! I don&apos;t think people care about anything but themselves these days. Just because the cigarette butt is small it is still considered trash! Nothing is worse than driving along and seeing trash scattered through medians, yards, and sidewalks, [not to mention my front yard!] I know I stated that I smoke, but I always dispose of the butts properly, I&apos;m a very clean smoker and I respect the rest of the world who doesn&apos;t. Since I&apos;m on the subject I want to also share something else I&apos;ve noticed. I hike allot in various places around Kentucky. KY is a beautiful place, but again it is awful so much trash and cigarette butts can be found on trails. I find it handy to carry an old bottle with a bit of water in it, to place cigarette butts in, and carry my trash until I reach a trash can!&quot;

&quot;All drivers in Lexington, Nicholasville, Danville, and everyone else in Kentucky that just forgot or never learned how to properly drive. If everyone would follow traffic laws and have consideration for others, traffic would move smoother, but the degenerates out on the roads feel the need to run red lights, cut you off, nearly run you off the road, drive really slow or fast [never the speed limit] never signal, tailgate, ect. and when you honk at them to bring to attention &quot;Hey you almost ran me off the road,&quot; or for whatever problem there was, they want to chase you, hand signal, curse and threaten you. I know there is a problem with basic common sense among citizens in these areas, but are people in and around Lexington really that uneducated and self absorbed? It&apos;s really sad and just adds to the stereotypes that Kentuckians are backwards, dumb, redneck hicks..... That&apos;s what really ticks me off!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;With the exception of one term for Louie Nunn as a Republican governor in 1967, Frankfort has been run by Democrats (with the exception of Fletcher&apos;s short present term in office), since the 40&apos;s I believe, those die heart LIBERAL Democrats out there &quot;chomping at the bit&quot; like Merlene Davis, Larry Dale Keeting, Joel Pett and the ENTIRE LIBERAL HERALD LEADER STAFF, plus others, you might like to know about the Kentucky state employee retirement fund being $12 BILLION SHORT. Fletcher has SAVED the state $279 Million in his short term, so WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS CAUSED THE SHORTFALL??? THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE YOU VOTE!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Tubby is definitely an elite coach. Look at his NCAA record-- during Tubby&apos;s tenure, only UK and Duke have advanced past the first round all nine years. Not getting punked out in the first round like all of the other teams definitely qualifies as elite. Also during Tubby&apos;s nine years, there are only six schools with NCAA tournament winning percentages above 70%, and UK is (of course) among them. There are only four teams with 20 tournament wins or more, and UK is again among them. There are 8 teams that have won championships. Again, UK is among them. There are five schools with four or more Elite 8 appearances, and yes, Virginia, UK again is among them, also. These are facts, so relax and enjoy your team. Be very thankful for Tubby. I am.&quot;

&quot;AM, I agree there are some forms of rap that are bad but there isnt any singing in rap. Just rapping. But not all rap is bad just lke not all rock is. corny. There are bad apples in every bunch for rock it was the tacky hair bands that put out the pop hits for teenage girls like &quot;she&apos;s only 17&quot;. Since I am gen x, i know that song and video was popular on Mtv&apos;s weekly top 20. Yet know we look back at that decade and was thinking &quot;wtf&quot;. Not all hair bands are bad such as Metallica. Its just those damn teenie bopper bands which made drop off the face of the earth and mtv until Nirvana showed up. Those drug induced nuts you speak of must have been listening to rock music since it tends to have and overwhelming &quot;loser&quot; feeling of encouraging &quot;losers&quot; to take a gun to their head or just &quot;kill em all&quot;.

&quot;I hate to see anyone being treated without respect and dignity. I have seen many, highly educated professionals treating other people in a hateful, mean and downright ugly was. Just because someone has an education/diploma does not make them a descent person. That housekeeper or gas station attendant may be learning disabled. Most ppl would not make fun of someone in a wheelchair, but if they see someone struggling to make ends meet and have to struggle to pay the bills and put shoes on their kids feet and are working an honest job at the local speedway, I say hooray for them, they could be out selling crack to your babies.

&quot;ya know, I&apos;m African American, and I somewhat on the Tubby Bandwagon on things need to change this year or else. For now he has an extension through the rest of the year since he beat indiana and louisville, it wasnt pretty but needless to say, we still won.If things go down later towards the end of the season then he should go but not on race alone. I will say opinions such as those like &quot;TC&quot; pretty is the god given reason why movies such as &quot;Glory Road&quot; was made, to expose the racism that existed 40 years ago and the racism that exist now. I realize that there were some parts of the movie that were &quot;Hollywood&quot; or sensationalism but I think anyone could still get the point. Again, I agree tubby should go if the team doesnt do well but for all the bashers out there, dont get p.o. if another black coach is hired right behind him. For all of those who want to attack the roots and heritage festival and bet television. I think you forgot how long it was before Mtv did start playing rap, R&amp;b;or hip-hop music...... On the mainstream. Like most folds I dont agree with whats out there today in regards to rap but you cant tell me hair bands from the 80&apos;s like &quot;warrant. twisted sister that &quot;she&apos;s my cherry pie band&quot; actually had any talent. Can you blame us for bet, i mean you have all the other networks, network, media and advertisers cater to you. But forgot about the blacks, asians, hispanics, indians, etc. This years survivor was the &quot;best ever&quot; because it help break down stereotyps and put and end of putting &quot;token&quot; players on their show just to meet a quota. Like it or not, America is diversifying.When it comes to history, I know more about the beginning of this country, civil war&amp;stonewall jackson than most white kids know about MLK. But I bet they know every member of G-Unit or Wu-tang clan We realize great white sports such as Nascar have fans nervous with the new changes taking place but dont worry, you&apos;ll be able to fly your stars and bars in the infield to help preserve your heritage or ..the other.Nascar will always be know as a &quot;Southern Sport&quot; But thats why we live in such as great country that gives us rights to speak our mind as jerks, idiots, bigots or just moral good citizens. Just a there are those who have the right to wear their &quot;southern by the grace of God&quot; shirts I reserce my right to wear &quot;By any means necessary.&quot;. So the best way we can all get through this is join hands around a campfire (not a cross on fire) and sing a verse of Kum bay yah and accept for the fact that there is a good chance our children are going to date someone outside their race. While most of us have to deal with four more years George &quot;bleep&quot; bush. You can take one more year of Tubby &quot;dammit&quot; Smith. Thank you for your time.&quot;

I have learned tho that no one sits on that reign forever, they may think so, but there is a higher power, and that is GOD, you know if you trust him, do your job, do what&apos;s right, let him have it. You know it&apos;s amazing sometimes how one seems to hang themselves, and you didn&apos;t have to do a thanggggg.&quot;

&quot;You know, I agree with the comment about the ambulance. When you are sitting at rush hour max traffic, and no where to move on Nicholasville Road, at the New Circle Road, area, and the ambulances come, there is no where to move, and your doing your best. and yes some will plunge and come at you like a plow for snow, some tho truly have common sense when driving an emergency vehicle to try and find the best approach. I truly believe its all in the driver. You get these drives from who doey where, and they think they driving in downtown tim buck too, and don&apos;t know how to handle an emergency vehicle in Lexington&apos;s pathetic excuse of a traffic mess. Lord, Help us all.&quot;

&quot;Ok here&apos;s another, Old drivers at night. I&apos;m sitting on Richmond Road outbound at the Fontaine intersection at the light. There is a car waiting to turn from Fontaine on to Richmond. Once traffic clears, instead of pulling on to one of the 2 open clear lanes on &quot;its side of the road&quot;, Grandma pulls into the turning lane on my side of the road. THE LADY IS GOING DOWN THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. There were luckily not many cars coming from Walgreens but she made no attempt to stop and turn it around. This was at 5:30 pmnight. Once she got all the way down to the walgreen intersection she finally juped to her side of the road. I could only imagine of traffice was busier. So everybody do us all a favor, if Grandma or Grandpa calls to ask you to drive them to the local Walmart or dollar tree so they can just do some shopping or chill with their friends, do us a favor to save a life. Take them. I understand ppl make mistakes when driving but there those of us who realize and immediately correct to prevent accidents and those who drive down the road thiinking all is well until....CRASH!!!!&quot;

&quot;ok for all you folks who drop off kids for school. Here my tick. When the school crossing guard calls off they send a cop. to cover. Usually to help with traffic flow of cars getting in and out of the school lot the crossing guard will direct traffic. But when its a cop, they just stand there and wait for kids to help them cross the street. My kid goes to Millcreek Elementary off of Appian Way, Tates Creek elem, middle and high are nearby. So theres alot of traffic on this street for a good hour. Traffic was backing up from all directions. Cars couldnt pull into the school lot to drop their kids due to the large amount of cars that were still waiting to get out on the drive. Millcreek sits on Reva Ridge Way which yields to Appian from both directions. Usually the crossing guard will stop traffic on Appian so those at the school from dropping their kids off can get out. weds and thursday traffic was back up from all directions. Does anyone have these experiences, Its shocking a crossing guard has more sense to direct traffic than the police. Perhaps there are some reading the forums today, they will take notice and take action when they are filling in for someone. It would help ease backup plus prevent any possible accidents from desperate drivers tired of waiting to get out. I will give credit to some of the cops who realize when things get tight but there are some who have no clue.&quot;

&quot;hey kb get over it, the ambulance is an emergency vehicle and you are required to get out of the way, so do it and be quite. if you dont like that, stay home and off the roads. wouldn&apos;t be just great if we had less people like you on the road who are so inconvenienced by an emergency vehicle, someday it could be your emergency&quot;

&quot;What really ticks me off is when it&apos;s the middle of rush hour and an ambulance comes thru, instead of &quot;the ambulance&quot; using the emergency lane where NO ONE IS &quot;it&quot; insists on plugging down thru the very middle of traffic usually through the turning lane where NOONE can move!!!! Wouldn&apos;t it just be great if THEY used the emergency lane in the case of an emergency instead of trying to snow plow traffic off the road!!! I would think it would be faster!!!&quot;

&quot;It really ticks me off that Newberry wants to change the nepotism law for Police Chief Anthony Beatty, whose son is a fireman..........let him RETIRE as chief of police, and begin drawing his pension, name him Lexington&apos;s public service commissioner, and let him ALSO draw a SIX figure salary from the city. In addition, until someone is hired as Police Chief, he would be paid for dual roles. LEAVE THE LAW AS IT STANDS NEWBERRY, we have enough problems with the way our city is run as it is. That&apos;s ANOTHER problem with our teachers also.......they &quot;retire&quot; at maximum salary and immediately start teaching again. YOU SEE WHAT OUR SCHOOLS COST, DON&apos;T YOU?????? THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA for EITHER PROFESSION.&quot;

&quot;LL - Don&apos;t get me started - That is common practice for self-absorbed people who can&apos;t defend themselves with their own skills. They make you look bad and boast about themselves. I can give credit to a person more qualified than myself to have at something, but for them to encourage the &quot;dog eat dog&quot; mentality is just sad. And guys are just as bad, I have to say. This areas is too small to support that type of gross behavior and there is no reason it can&apos;t just be left to the better person. - I agree with your complaint and will add that Lexington needs to adopt better business practices with their employees, especially private companies.&quot;

Countries have been fighting holy wars longer than any of us have been living. I doubt their only focus is to take over the U.S. - Most people don&apos;t even know what &quot;they&quot; (since americans like to stick &quot;them&quot; all in one group) are fighting over - It&apos;s bigger than us and we just decided to butt our heads in and think we can come out the hero! - There&apos;s nothing sacrilegious or unamerican about saying we don&apos;t belong over there and it&apos;s time to come home. Our sure most troops would agree. Let us deal with fixing our own problems in this country before trying to fix others. I&apos;m proud to be an american but it&apos;s that closed-mided, misinformed, &quot;holier than thou&quot; common mentality that makes me embarassed at the same time.

Go ahead wait 2 more years like we waited 4-6. The public has spoken, Attach the liberal press all you want but it wasnt the democrats who won the election for democrats it was all the pubs and conservatives who are finally crossing over to make a statement that the war must stop now! Even when bush considered asking older bush buddy james baker to take over for rummy, he even admits &quot;stay the course&quot; should no longer be a course of action by our country. Sure dems and pubs voted for the war....BUT NOT THIS WAR. Remember the &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; 2700 dead soldiers lives ago, The picture of bush on the aircraft carrier with all those soldiers, this will forever tarnish his so called legacy. The clock is ticking. Its lets than 2 years still showdown in 2008. We might have saddam but we still dont have Osama, Wmd, or an outline on what our mission really is&quot;

&quot;MP, rounding up every non-american is nowhere related to my topic of immigrant gov. grants. Everyone is equal, no matter what origin they are from. I have no problem with immigration, most all of our ancestors immigrated here by boat hundreds of years ago, so why should it be any different now? The problem is the exclusive immigrant subsidized grants and funding via the gov. that our taxes are paying for, yet if I really needed the money I couldn&apos;t qualify??? If your comment on Deja Vu implies that I am a stripper you are wrong as I am a real estate investor and own a financial planning company.

&quot;HERE&apos;S MY RANT, PEOPLE. YOU ASKED FOR IT - I love Lexington. Don&apos;t get me wrong. But you have a HUGE problem relating to 3 main things - in particular, with Marketing and Advertising Firms: 1. Your Quality, 2. Professionalism and 3. Lack of communication in business environments. And here&apos;s why: 1. Quality: Everything comes down to how much you can get from people without paying them what they are worth. This area is flooded with unqualified &quot;graduates&quot; from business &quot;colleges&quot; that butt in and take jobs from those who took the time to get a proper education in either Advertising, Business, and/or Graphic Design and know more than just a bunch of filters in Photoshop or how to place an ad in the Yellow Pages. Both quality in originality and creativity suffer for it as well as the job market. There&apos;s alot of good work out there. But even more that just gets by: not because of time or budget constraints but because of an inability to fill a position with a person who knows what they are doing and cares, plus actually wants to make a difference for the community and their employer. And if it seemed as though the majority of people (note to working or single parent families: I didn&apos;t say all ) who went to 2-year programs were interested in more than just getting in with the least amount of effort, than it would be a different thing. Which brings us to #2. Professionalism: It&apos;s one thing to want your employees to &quot;wear many hats&quot; but the reality is there is a big difference in most of these areas employers assume people should be multi-faceted in. It takes alot more to know how to be a copywriter than just the ability to come up with a clever slogan. And some advertising people are just better and more effective for you behind the scenes than attending every pitch for an idea. I&apos;m not saying don&apos;t encourage your staff to expand their abilities, and for your own sake, don&apos;t limit yourself as an employee either. But don&apos;t expect to someone to know how to do it all. Those juggling too many balls often drop some on the floor, people. (...and all those other trite and witty metaphors you like to intrigue us with when hiring...). One more thing on that. Pay us what we&apos;re worth! I find it interesting that local averages for salaries are usually about $10k less than what employers say they will pay - if they say at all. The habit isn&apos;t anymore to hire the most qualified or professional, but the cheapest labor for the short duration you have a &quot;seasonal slam&quot;. What&apos;s worse is the compulsive &quot;last hired, first fired&quot; mentality that almost always follows when that slam is through. And employers continue to complain about the lack of commitment or professionalism from the employees?- Can you blame them when there&apos;s no job security? Respect works both ways. Lastly, #3: Communication. It&apos;s ironic that it&apos;s what alot of us do for a living though few have the ability to apply it in the work environment. A few examples? When someone applies for a position, let them know if your not going to hire them! We don&apos;t care if it&apos;s an email, letter from the HR dept. or some pre-typed reason on a letterhead. It lets us know &quot;thank you, but no thank you&quot; and that we don&apos;t have to wait for an answer. And do it in a timely manner, please. We take the time to show an interest in you so take the time and to kindly respect that in return. - Also, it&apos;s alot easier to work with or for someone when you acknowledge them as a person than just a &quot;tool&quot; (try &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;how are you&quot; before &quot;I need this done yesterday&quot; or just leaving it on our desk with a Post-it). And finally, say Thank you or acknowledge our commitment to making both you, the company and ourselves look good or do better. Just because it might be &quot;part of the job&quot; doesn&apos;t mean our efforts should go unnoticed. Believe me, we appreciate it. Okay, I&apos;m getting off my soapbox now. I&apos;m sure alot of this applies to more than just the local Marketing and Advertising community and that &quot;it&apos;s like that everywhere and not just Lexington&quot;. But for an area this size, there certainly seems alot of these problems. And believe me, those of us in it and trying to make a difference and a living know. Thank you for listening.&quot;

&quot;What ticks me off are government programs assisting immigrants, legal or not, with grants/funding to open businesses, obtain housing, job training, etc. etc. Why is it that the federal governemnt sets aside funding for immigrants to open a corner gas station yet I, single working American mother of 2, cannot get equal funding to live my American dream? I feel like I&apos;ve hopped on a plane to Iraq or Mexico when I stop to fill up my car or get a bite to eat. They can&apos;t understand a damn thing I say, want, or need and they look at me like I&apos;m the idiot. To hell with learning their language, they came to America so learn ours. America truly is a mixed culture, land of the free, but how &quot;free&quot; does it get? I&apos;m not prejudice AT ALL and I respect the diversity, but where&apos;s the equality? It&apos;s our own governments fault for aiding and nurturing those that aren&apos;t their own and ignoring the ones who are.&quot;

&quot;The Lord Jesus Christ ticks me off. American does not equal Christian! There is no official religion in this country, if you hadn&apos;t noticed. Everyone knows all about Jesus, an those who don&apos;t believe in the him and/or don&apos;t subscribe to Christian ideas have, for the most part, made a much more informed decision than the majority of Christians in America. Shouldn&apos;t it bother a religious institution that the face of their congregation is one of ignorance? That the connotation associated with being Christian in America is that you are provincial in thought and intolerant in deed? Being a Christian myself, I&apos;m more than a little agitated by that. The teachings of Christ are lost on us if we, as his followers, don&apos;t start to act more like him.&quot;

&quot;Lexington streets really aren&apos;t that bad except for a few spots that need to be redone. Example...Todds Rd. at Man o&apos; War and Todds Rd. at Liberty. I agree with many of you about cell phones and the idiots who have hour long conversations while in rush hour traffic. I&apos;ll admit that I will talk on the phone while I drive BUT I will not allow the conversation to last longer than it needs to. If you need to talk to that person tell them you are in traffic and you&apos;ll call them back when you get to the destination. That simple. As a society, we are always connected. People have forgotten what it is like to have &quot;quiet&quot; times. As for spending money on &quot;community&quot; supplies for school children. Many of my friends whom are teachers spend quite a bit during the school year on supplies like tape, staples, construction paper, dry erase markers for the new &quot;chalkboards&quot;, etc. The school gives each teacher a budget for supplies, books etc for the year. What happend to the Kentucky lottery benefiting education in KY? That was the main reason why the lottery passed into legislation, wasn&apos;t it? Seperation of church and state. Freedom of religion was one of the bricks that this country was founded and built with. The only reason why politicans are wanting to &quot;seperate&quot; the Ten Commandments and God from state is to please non-christian beliefs. Bi-lingual America. I can&apos;t stand it. When Americans travel to Europe we try to learn the language or at least understand it so we can travel and communicate. When most people travel to the U.S. they understand english. If people want to cross our southern boarder to &quot;have a better life&quot; then learn our language. And learn to do it legally. I&apos;m tired of my tax dollars going toward medical and education for illeagals.&quot;

&quot;We want to say Merry Christmas at work when we answer the phone, Oh my gosh, do we offend the Kwanzas, the jews, the Muslims, the who evers. Happy Hanakau, Happy Kawanza, Happy Happy, Yes, What truly Happy is is about our Lord Jesus Christ, he is our Saviour, and it is at this time We Celebrate this time of the year, with Merry CHRISTmas. It is the reason for the season. If one should get mad, think about it one day when GOD does turn his back on us. You think times are bad now, GUNS, PEDOFILES, THEIVES, RAPES, MURDERS, PERSECUTIONS OF ALL, CRIME, AN EVIL BEYOND EVIL,Then try all of this and all without CHRIST, One day it will happen, I ask all who read this, the only way ever to find peace, love, happiness, and an inner filling to the depth of ones heart, To never be alone, as GOD is in our heart, as he helps us thorugh the struggles of every day. What ticks me off, is intolerance, BUT, with JESUS CHRIST, THE LORD OF ALL, AND IT IS HE WHO REIGNS MOST HIGH YOU WILL FIND TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND HIM, YOU WILL HAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE HAPPINESS ONE COULD EVER KNOW. I have it. THANK GOD!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Spanish, I stop in this bakery today. I asked what the pastries were, I actually was looking for what I thought was the Japenese or ? bakery around Codell drive. No one spoke a bit of English. There was a girl and a guy, He started laughing. I just left. This is not New York City. This is Lexington. Again, if you are here, learn our language, how do you expect to run a business. I speak English, yes one can learn many other languages, but speak the one of the place your in. Learn it. or go back!!!!&quot;

&quot;PM.....You are so right, we need Jesus in every thing we do.......and taking Jesus out of our schools is just another &quot;Politically Correct&quot; piece of CRAP........hiding behind church and state..........which regardless of what the schools and unions want you to believe..........DOES NOT TRULY EXIST. RESEARCH IT, DON&apos;T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. Think of EVERYTHING else that&apos;s changed in the schools.......guess that&apos;s church and state too.!!! The killings, the guns, the drugs, teachers sex with students, etc., etc. As long as the public schools get the enormous amount of money from the taxpayers &quot;whether their kids go to public or private schools, or have kids in school at all, &quot; the schools will NEVER CHANGE OR IMPROVE.&quot; Once again today, as yesterday, there were ALL sorts of school buses at the mall DURING school hours. I&apos;m one taxpayer that&apos;s SICK OF IT, plus............. I haven&apos;t had a kid in school in years but our SCHOOL TAX BURDEN NEVER DECREASES!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;JR-take your two year old to fayette mall. in the middle is a play land. stay away from busy times b/c there will be a lot of kids. Speaking of what ticks me off....when I take my kids a play land and someone has dumped their 9,10,11 year old off at the play land and they are running around dangering the younger kids? Do they get yelled at my rent a cops? NOOOO! But I have to throw my drink away that I have BOUGHT at the mall b/c the mall cop tells me to! people watch your kids!&quot;

 ap, lex, ky   |   



 


&quot;PM, I agree but the main reason is taking Jesus out of our schools and trying to take our freedom away. We need God and wee need our freedom people need to stand up for their rights, but so many of them don&apos;t even take time to vote...but they will complain when their rights are taken away....If you want to keep your freedom you need to make sure you are registered to vote and make sure you VOTE on Election days, It is ashame that less than 50% of registered voters even show up to vote.&quot;

&quot;I would be inclined to think most of the Walmart employees are not college educated, however, with benefits, etc. plus $12. an hour salary, might be better than they can make elsewhere. Obviously, they&apos;ve all looked at other jobs, prior to taking the Walmart job.&quot;

 SQ, Rich., KY.   |   



 


&quot;Yeah, I must agree that Wal-Mart is really ticking me off too. I heard they are capping the salaries of those that make anything over 12.00 an hour. So basically, anyone who has been there 7 years or more can&apos;t recieve anymore raises. Maybe if they gave their most loyal employees raises their employees wouldn&apos;t be so darn disgruntled all the time!&quot;

&quot;Lexington drivers regularly complain about the traffic problems and congestion. The problem is the drivers, not the lights or systems. People, when the light turns green, look both ways and use the pedal on the right, GO!!! When the first person takes literally. eight to ten seconds to get through an intersection and fool number two leaves 6-9 car lengths between him and the first slowpoke, what do you expect? Lexington roads are wide open, well timed and can accomadate very large flows of traffic. If people never get moving , of course you get stopped at every light! Nicholoasville Rd, is 45MPH, 5 lanes wide and very well maintained. Frequently I feel like I&apos;m speeding, check the speedometer and find out I&apos;m only doing 40-45 mph. No wonder traffic backs up! It is not necessary to leave 5-10 car lengths between vehicles moving at 20 mph turning on to New Circle Road Wake up and move!&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s really ticking me off? Rude teenagers. Example: on Halloween night I was handing out candy, when I noticed three teenagers walking down the sidewalk towards my house. Two girls, one guy, all three of them on their cellphones. These kids were WAY past the age of normal trick-or-treaters; not one of them could&apos;ve been under 15 or 16. When they approached me, only one of them had the common courtesy to put her phone down and say &quot;Trick-or-Treat!&quot; the other two just shoved their pillow cases in front of my face while they continued to blab away on their phones. How rude. And I&apos;m sure most of you&apos;ve have had the experience of being bumped into by a gang of hormonal teens in the mall without an &quot;excuse me&quot; in sight. I would hate to be a high school teacher - jeez, what those poor people go through everyday. I am newly married and would love to raise a family with my husband, if it weren&apos;t for the fact that our beautiful baby/child would soon turn into a monsterous teenager.&quot;

 CB, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Yeah, its redicoulous that I have to purchase &quot;Community Supplies&quot; for my sons class. I guess those students that can&apos;t afford to buy supplies get plenty.

 JM, Nicholasville, KY   |   



 


&quot;JM.....I too, have an idea as to where our school taxes are going instead of to our schools.................I was at The Fayette Mall today around 1-2 PM and there were 11 school buses.. 8 from Fayette Co., the rest from Jessamine Co......WHAT COULD THE MALL BE TEACHING OUR KIDS?????????? I have seen this many, many times at the mall. NOT ONE TIME in my school days were we ever transported to the mall during OR after school hours. ANOTHER WASTE!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Isn&apos;t something wrong with our city traffic when things go smoohter during rush hour in larger cities such as Louisville and Cincy. Do something about all these traffic problem and quit worrying about the water.&quot;

 MC, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;JM..........When you consider approx. $10,000 plus, per year, per student, and you have to use money from your own pocket to buy supplies, I&apos;d say entirely too much of the taxpayers money might be going for FREE BABYSITTING, such as HEAD START, ALL DAY KINDERGARTEN, AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS, ESL teachers, ILLEGALS children going to our schools, when most parents are paying NO TAXES, etc., etc. This desperately needs to be addressed in the school system. We NEED to get back to good old COMMON SENSE and LESS POLITICALLY CORRECT NONSENSE. We as taxpayers CANNOT continue having our property taxes, taxes on every utility bill, etc., etc. going up EACH AND EVERY YEAR.&quot;

&quot;Im not so sure I agree with GWs assessment of the enemys attitude toward our soldiers. Whenever America has dealt with an enemy in combat the enemy has been subjected to certain psycological propoganda maintaining that Americans would rape and pillage and should fight to the death. Todays enemy is no different their hatred for our nation has nothing to do with our treatment of prisoners at Gitmo but rather our countries self serving agendas since the beginning of the cold war and our seemingly pointless invasion of a soverign middle east country. These people are either indocrinated with extreme islamic jihadist belief at their lowest point in life or from the time they are in diapers. War is hell, I know Ive been there, and a by any means nececessary approach is required in those situations. The real problem that arises is when politicians become involved in war, that was the problem in Vietnam, tell us where to go and what to do and let the soldiers do it, its what we do for a living.&quot;

&quot;ML- Thanks for clarifying. Just wish those other 95 % spoke up for newberry. I did vote for him, just got tired with the mayor stretching this whole water thing further than it needed. Heck, it would have been better to practice eminent domain on lexington mall instead of the water company. The mall is an embarrasment. I&apos;ve lived her all my life and it reminds me of the Ben Snyder block. I think we need an across the board audit of the city and states accouting books. State Auditor Crit Luallen is doing an awesome job looking deeper into the states finances and trying to keep them honest. I think the same should happen for the city and school systems. At least with the lextran property tax, we dont hear anymore about the transit system making cutbacks anymore.But its a shame we have all these taxes on so many services and they still need money to get by. Is the city that far behind.&quot;

 SL, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;Pb, what i feel you missed is that we as Americans or the United States the last several decades have been outspoken against methods when out spies were in foreign hands during the cold war. We&apos;re guilty of preaching one thing and doing another. One of my favorite shows is &quot;24&quot;, the lead charecter has a &quot;by all means necessary&quot; attitude to getting information on the enemy. But I&apos;ll admit it wasnt all legal. If we dont want other rogue countries to use abuse our troops and and ops in the same manner we consider to be illegal, then we must practice what we preach. This is why most of our allies are not so quick to stand with us. We end up looking like hypocrites.Could you imagine, north korea holding our prisoners five years as we do at gitmo&quot;

&quot;What bothers me greatly as a Christian who believes strongly in defending my country, AMERICA, AND our boys who serve our country so bravely to preserve our freedom..............IT BREAKS MY HEART to see them exposed to National TV and getting their heads blown off OR cut off...possibly seen by their parents. I read letters in The Herald Leader recently of people having the unmitigated gall and the audacity to get angry with our interrogation of these war criminals, wanting them coddled I suppose, and put up in 5 star hotels. It&apos;s a known fact some of the tatics work during interrogation................THAT&apos;S THE PURPOSE and it&apos;s called INFORMATION!!! WHEN IN THIS COUNTRY DID WE START BREEDING TRAITORS? TAKE YOUR POLITICALLY CORRECT CRAP AND MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE DON&apos;T WANT YOUR MENTALITY HERE.&quot;

&quot;I would just like to see people in Lexington use their turning signals and pay attention at four-way stops. I love this city, try some others and you will see why. Oh and to ss and ls, people who feel strongly about an issue are not necessarily uneducated. They have strong feelings about experiences you may not have shared. Ignorance is not just lack of education, it is lack of experiencing also. So much for your openminded delusion.&quot;

&quot;The Herald Leader ALWAYS endorses a LIBERAL for any public office, that&apos;s why they endorsed Newberry..........otherwise, they would definitely have endorsed Isaac, since she&apos;s a LIBERAL.

&quot;I know this isnt a major traffic issue but I would like to complain about the stoplight at Lafayette Pkwy and Rosemont garden. It&apos;s 2 lanes people. Left lane turns left. Right lane goes straight and turns right. There is no dividing line between the lanes, but there are 2 hanging lights. Please stop trying to go straight from 2 lanes into one. Okay, I am done.

Does anyone else have this same problem? I hate when people park in the handicapped space and obviously should not be parking there. And why is Central Banks drive thru SO SLOOOOOOW?????

&quot;People talking on cell phones while driving. You drive with one hand while carrying on a conversation about uncle Jack&apos;s last bowel movement and you are very dangerous on the roads. The number of fender benders and terrible wrecks that happen while on cell phones would amaze us all. If you need to make a call, do so and get off the phone quickly. I was on Interstate 75 the other day in the fast lane behind a car that was going 55 MPH. The car would brake for no reason at all and weave like it was going to hit the median. I passed the car only to see a younger girl talking on her cell phone with no concept of what she was doing. Just limit your cell phone use while in the car, thats all I ask.&quot;

As long as they get &quot;checks&quot; from the taxpayers every month............THEY&apos;LL NEVER WORK and our problem with ILLEGAL&apos;S WILL NEVER BE SOLVED.

&quot;Yes, granted all the illegals take the crappy jobs, yes, but lets look at the real picture. How many are on food stamps, government housing, welfare, how many do you see not working. Yes there are those that do work very hard. But this is American. Learn our language, In case one has forgotten it is English. Can I go to Japan and make them all suddenly speak English, Absolutely not. They have their own language. You can tell the person at the window at McDonalds you have a problem with your order because they don&apos;t understand English, and they can&apos;t speak it. Have anyone ever driven around and seen how many just illegals, legal??? who knows just sitting around, walking around? Doing nothing except free loading. This is nothing about those that don&apos;t want to work, but when we work, we do have an obligation to do as Americans do, learn our language, conform, how many times now, do we have to conform to their ways. We have to learn Spanish, Now is that the proper, or the Slang one speaks. Our medical profession has to learn Spanish just to communicate ( and see this goes with all other immigrants that come, not just one orgin), but we are conforming to those, We are becoming Mexico., not American, not Lexington, Juest look for yourselves!!!!&quot;

&quot;Is any one else as sick as I am of all the political mail. Yesterday, I had 8 flyers in my mailbox. Everyday, its something, from someone knocking on my door, to these flyers, to the messages pre-recorded on my answering machine, to all the signs we see. The newpaper, the letters to the editor, the commercials, the Lexington papers paid ads. To again all the signs everywhere you go. Its overkill. I know who I want to vote for, and not one thing of the above has influenced me. Lets cut all this garbage!!!!&quot;

&quot;I&apos;ve just logged on to this forum, and I am amazed at how asinine people are- ticked off over these small, insignificant things. My Lord, this world has starving people, sick people, lonely elderly people, gangs, drugs, all kinds of problems, and all you can complain about is the traffic lights? Good Lord folks please- if you&apos;re going to get upset about something at least make it something worthwhile. While I too become frustrated with a lot of things in and around Lexington, I thank the Good Lord everyday to work and live in such a beautiful environment: one where crime is fairly low, the economy is quite decent, and in a country where we are free. Stop complaining and start appreciating what you have- you&apos;ll enjoy your life so much more...&quot;

&quot;BAD RAISES! I mean you work all year long just to expect a little something in return and look what it gets you a worthless 32 cent raise. That just proves to me I can keep doing the same meaningless work at my job and not try any harder and still get the bare minimum raise.&quot;

&quot;Idiots with no patience for those learning a new language. Too many people are quick to criticize those who have come to our country to make a better life for themselves, because their own country left them to starve. They will come here and take up the crappiest job and eek out a living and be perfectly content with that. But some lazy bum at a McDonalds who can&apos;t hurry and get heart disease fast enough, finds it easy to poke at them for not being able to speak english yet. The hispanics who came here to take on the jobs no one else wants, or are too lazy to do, help keep our economy running, and they serve as best they can.&quot;

&quot;I can&apos;t understand the teacher who wrote in to say he spent $1300. out of his own pocket on school supplies..........Fayette Co. students average $10,000. PLUS, per student, per year........we taxpayers are paying for that and we don&apos;t even have kids in school, what&apos;s happening to ALL THAT MONEY GOING TO FAYETTE CO. SCHOOLS?????&quot;

&quot;The water debate! The two biggest reasons that I have heard for condeming the water company is that it is foriegn owned and is a monopoly. To me, neither of those reasons are good enough to condenm a private company. What about KU? It is a monopoly as much as Kentucky-American Water and is part of LG&amp;E;, which is also owned by a German company. Are we going to condenm KU next?&quot;

Besides, all these people walked down the public streets and right past the Lexington Police headquarters to go into the Kentucky Theater.

Also, not making it mandatory for companies to offer short-term disability. We can work our butts off to make money to raise our kids and pay our taxes but we sure as heck can&apos;t get paid for the six weeks after we have a baby.

&quot;What ticks me off is comments like the ones made by Md....all of the items on school supply lists are used by the kids...I had my students buy two dry erase markers for the students boards that I bought for each child. I spent over $1300 of my own money last year alone to educate my students. Another thing....it is against the law for the &quot;students to sit and watch others eat, while they get starved . Schools have free and reduced lunch programs. If a child should need a lunch and doesn&apos;t qualify for these programs, the schools still provide food. I have personally bought kids food because they did not like what they were served. Please get your facts straight before you spread such garbage. Your statements were untrue. Also, what have you personally done to have poor students. I can assure that all the educators that I work with have provided food, clothes, supplies, etc. for needy kids.&quot;

&quot;Whew, where do I begin; TRAFFIC: I can either leave work at 5pm and get home (going through town) at 5:45pm, OR leave the office 5:30 and STILL get home at 5:45. Something&apos;s gotta give w/the downtown traffic. Doesn&apos;t seem like the lights are sequenced correctly?!?! DRIVERS: Hang up and Drive; Quit Tailgating; slow the *BLEEP* down; makeup should be put on @ home, and beards shaved there too; Please, do not pull out in front on me while I&apos;m coming down Nicholasville Road, just so I need to slam on MY brakes so you can take that important immediate right hand turn onto the next street. Please also do not make a left turn from the right turn lane, cutting me off in the process. The major car companies gave us a special tool to use while we are driving... it&apos;s called a BLINKER/TURN SIGNAL...use it. It is NOT ok to park 1/2 in the road and 1/2 on the widewalk because you have your &quot;Flashers on&quot;, and this includes the fire lane at the Krogers where you are parking because it&apos;s raining/snowing. Find a spot and walk. Everyone should exercise. And if you do it because your with someone that&apos;s handicapped, I have one of those too...and that&apos;s why I use those strange parking places that are painted BLUE!. ROADS: Lexington had AWESOME streets when I moved here in 1995 (atleast compared to Michigan). These streets are HORRIBLE!! And when they DO finally fix them, it&apos;s some alleyway or parking lot instead of Winchester Road or another major road! Have you driven Winchester Road lately?!?! GOOD GOLLY! Manhole, railroad tracks (which always has someone&apos;s hubcab laying by it), pot holes... like playing Frogger out there dodgin&apos; and weavin...which just causes another traffice hazzard... YOUNG/&quot;THUG&quot; DRIVERS: Your wheels are worth $15,000 ,your stereo around $3,000 and both are on a car worth about $400.00 You may like to drive around town in your &quot;Tricked out ride&quot; with your THUMP THUMP THUMP music banging in your ears, but I don&apos;t want to hear it. I don&apos;t want to hear the metal on your car vibrate... I want to hear want&apos;s going on in the REAL world, like fire trucks/ambulances needing to get through..... TURN IT DOWN! How distracting... and oh yeah, let the &quot;Tude&quot; go... and grown up, that would be &quot;tight&quot; Ok, enough for now, but I maybe back....&quot;

&quot;Why is the city so overly concerned with the water company? We cant we redirect that energy towards something that will affect people on a more direct level? Like: the roads, or after school programs for kids, or how about we actually do something about our growing winter homeless situation? What about the fact that the list for school supplies actually listed stuff that the teacher would use like dry erase makers. Did we forgot about those kids who dont eat lunch because the school wont let them charge, so kids are sitting in the cafeteria, watching other kids eat while they are hungry. Forget about the water company, we have real issues that just need some light to be shown on them!&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should change the title of this forum from &quot;whats ticking you off&quot; to &quot;How can we make Lexington better or what Lexington needs&quot; This way, our elected officials will feel more compelled to read and understand our views than just read another disgruntled citizen&apos;s opinion and hatred for whatever movement. I&apos;ll admit I&apos;ve been guilty myself of crossing the line when expressing my view. Usually its response to another person&apos;s personal opinion. By being so mean spirited in the forum, we really destroy the fun and friendly social gathering this website was designed for.&quot;

I don&apos;t believe this is the propert forum for such controversy and that you should restrict the political and religious retoric since most of it is simply uneducated opinions that are baseless and factless. It is more fun to complain about cigarette butts at the major intersections, trash in the medians of New Circle Road, gas prices and the Right of Eminent Domain.

&quot;In regards to people that don&apos;t vote ticking someone off, I don&apos;t understand. I think that low voter turnout is a media-created joke.

Also, we have a &quot;right&quot; to vote, just as we have a ride to publicly assemble or bear arms. I don&apos;t hear anyone complaining about people that don&apos;t practice those rights.&quot;

 EL, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;I Share your attitude Lv. How about this though. As much of an importance we all put on voting in the elections, I feel Voting Day in November should be a a national Holiday and a paid holiday. South Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan are just a few of the countries who have had their first democratic elections. We push all the time for other coutries to have a similar process but our own country barely votes. I was please with the turn our of the last election. It goes to show that regardless of which side you sit, everyone really did care about their future and who controls it. But since most polling places are held at schools and schools are usually closed on this day, This really should be a holiday. I believe such a day will keep an cosistant number of citizens at the polls. It should be in congress for the next election. Who&apos;s with me on this?&quot;

 SL, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;People who don&apos;t vote and complain on the internet about things that happen in theworld, our state and community. It ticks me off that on election day, 60% of the people who have made a comment on this website won&apos;t botter to drive or walk the 2 miles from thier home to vote. How many Iraqi&apos;s risked thier lives to vote? Although I beleive in free speech and appreciate this venue for giving it to us, it is a waste if we don&apos;t vote so we can really do soemthing about these opinions.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m not going to debate if we should be taxed for the Lextran service most of us dont use and probably should if you look at the poor layout of this city with no major freeway. But complaints I&apos;ve been hearing lately is that some ppl assume our citizens do not ride the bus. I drive to work but before I also rode the bus. Before the new busses were put into place, the old ones were in horrible condition. Ever been on Tates Creek road early in the morning and wondered why the bus driver was driving so slow. It wasnt his/her fault, in some cases the busses could only go 25-30 miles another. I felt sorry for the driver. Some busses I felt put us at risk but lextran did what they could with what they hand and the community that had to be served. Now there are new busses and things are easier. For those may feel there are not alot of ppl who ride the bus so why should we be taxed for it, I invite you to take a day or a week out of your time to ride to and from work. You&apos;ll find those that are served are people of all races. White, Black, Asian, hispanic,etc. You&apos;ll find that several are senior citizens, several are people who have conditions that prevent them from ever driving. Some do not have the financials means to drive. Others you would probably be glad they are not driving period. Some are going to school, chruch, shopping but most are going to work. Mom&apos;s taking their children to the doctor. Just like morning and evening rush hour traffic. These are the peak times when you will see alot of riders. Drive by the transit center during these times and you will see them. Dont forget in the real cities, mass transit is a way of life. Not just something that the rich pay for the less fortunate. It serves everyone. I drive to work not, but every once in a while I dont mind to just sit and let someone else handle all the hustle and bustling that goes on during rush hour. Thank you for your time.&quot;

&quot;All these BIG government subsidized Lextran busses running all over town with 3 or 4 people in them. If the city wants to make a responsible environmentally friendly decision, get those big busses off the streets and buy some smaller ones like we see in other cities.&quot;

&quot;The fact that I can&apos;t go to college. Ever college looks at SAT score and says &quot;well you are a bad student&quot;. Hello? Have you looked at the classes I&apos;ve taken? Special Education math. I have dyscalculia and thanks to the No Child Left Behind Act, I can&apos;t even divide on paper. I&apos;m 19 years old! The No Child Left Behind says &quot;well you&apos;re a little slow in the math department so we&apos;re just going to hand you a calculator and teach you the same stuff every single year-Fractions, money, time and pi. Without a good college education, I&apos;m going to be stuck either in debt from private tutoring so I can learn what basic 6th graders know or be stuck working at a minimum wage job.&quot;

&quot;Pb, the world trade was connected to the muslims. But should we dislike all muslims, Mark Foley stepped down just so he wouldnt have to show his face on the capital where ever press organization is camping out for him but I see several other Repulican colleagues was aware this was already going on and just thought perhaps it was, a phase. I suppose child perverted priest in the catholic church was just as phase too. Who is responsible for Christ dying on the cross? The Roman&apos;s, Jews, Sinners. Should we dislike them too. Wasn&apos;t it in the bible that says, &quot;I do not hate the sinner but dislike the sin&quot;. Remember all the girls that were killedt in the Amish school. When reporters interviewed the parents,families and friends of some of these girls about their grief. I did not find any of them say that they hated the man that committed the crime. They&apos;re faith as Christians has tought them to forgive. Not forget but to forgive. They&apos;re faith as Christians bas brough them through the tragedy.Foley, Nixon, Delay, soon to be Hastert, Nay, and a couple of others from the...... Republican congress whom have stepped down... Stepped down at the demanding of leadership within their own party. To some pubs they might be heros. To the rest of us the look alot more like... QUITTERS!!! You seem to have issues with Gays, liberals, Muslims, and I assume all of the other above that may not be conservative anglo saxon. I&apos;m sorry you support a conservative base which is having trouble leaking damaging information on its own party.I&apos;m sorry Clinton cheated on his wife..... Got Elected.... Possibly cheated again.... Got relected. Got caught lying about cheating with an intern.. impeachment but who&apos;s counting. But when Bush, Rice, Rummy and Cheney talked about weapons of mass destruction and whatever else. 2,743 soldiers dead as of today. 2,606 since we &quot;Accomplished our Mission&quot; 2 month&apos;s after ther war ended. 2,276 since we captured Saddam. 1,307 since their first elections were held this year. And at least 20,000 Americans wounded in Battle. Thats enough to fill Rupp. Oh my source was Antiwar.com. I&apos;m sure you might lable them as a.... Liberal website but I&apos;m sure their figures are very accurate., Clinton lied, nobody died. &quot;No more letters please!&quot; by Pb. Please understand you brought this on yourself when you attacked someone who just happens to be gay, for expressing their view on a tv show. Which they had the right to do as much as you had the right to change the channel. I see you have a way with dogs too. Might I suggest some anger mgmt classes and a week at the local humane society. But if you want to keep barking, we&apos;ll keep putting you back in your cage until you behave like a good little conservative.&quot;

&quot;GW.......If you are so anxious to discuss history..........let me give you just a FEW examples of why some of us might find Muslims..........UNDESIRABLE................1993 World Trade Ctr. underground garage bombing, 6 killed, another 1000 injured...cost taxpayers $500 million. Oct. 12, 2000... U.S.S. Cole bombed, 17 U.S. sailors killed..................Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Ctr. bombing, 2996 people killed. As to your comment on Foley, I agree wholeheartedly about sexual predators, HOWEVER.........at least he had the common sense to step down.............let&apos;s GO BACK IN YOUR HISTORY LESSONS AGAIN..........Ted Kennedy killed Mary Jo Kopechne in 1969 (drunk... car wreck) he swam to shore, leaving her in car. He was making calls trying to get someone else to take the blame...........ALL OF THIS WAS MADE PUBLIC BUT...........KENNEDY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESIGN, NOR WAS HE ASKED TO BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. GAY DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN Barney Frank from MA, running a prostitution ring out of his townhouse in 1989 with his boyfriend.............FRANK MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESIGN, NOR DID THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ASK HIM TO. BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, having sex with an INTERN in the White House, MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESIGN, NOR DID THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ASK HIM TO. These bombings were linked DIRECTLY TO MUSLIMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DOES THIS GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHY WE MIGHT DISLIKE THEM OR DOES YOUR POLITICALLY CORRECT, SECULAR PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE HAVE YOU BLINDSIDED?? YOU MIGHT ALSO look within your LIBERAL BASE with your WEBSTER DICTIONARY and FIND THE DEFINITION OF &quot;HYPOCRITE!!!!!!&quot; ENOUGH SAID..............NO MORE LETTERS PLEASE.&quot;

&quot;Pb, the country may be founded on religion, but the doctrine (U.S. Constitution) which runs say it shall not be run by it. You may find this info in your history books. You basically remind me of all the other conservative christian bigots who preach values and love but hide their hate behind the cross. Should I assume that all other christians are bigots as well. No, I also as a christian know that our faith is based on love and not hate. There are bad apples in every batch. Just as there are some within the muslim, catholic, jewish faiths, there are also bad apples within the christian faith. You are so busy to attack other people&apos;s religion without practicing the love that christ was crucified for. I suggest you look within your conservative base and start weeding out all the perverts who prey on our children within congress such as Mark Foley.&quot;

&quot;To the &quot;POLITICALLY CORRECT&quot; writer who compares DOGS BARKING CONSTANTLY to kids playing and birds chirping, is just an example of &quot;how far over the edge these people are.&quot; NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO LISTEN TO DOGS BARKING NON STOP DAY&amp;NIGHT!!! NO COMPARISON TO KIDS PLAYING OR BIRDS CHIRPING. GET IN THE REAL WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Traffic lights in Lexington are ridiculous. It seems like I hit every light. Do you feel the same way?&quot;

&quot;i&apos;m going to start running the red light at nichville rd, manowar intersect in the morning. anyone with me? if everyone does it, lfucg will have to get off their glutes and fix the freakin thing. constant complaining on here won&apos;t nudge any kind of movement.&quot;

&quot;So you&apos;re going to leave Walmart for Kmart. Since you cant probably save your money properly thats where they will be able to help you better. Walmart pretty much owns the nation. Plus has 100 times the product and quality in product than what Kmart. I suggest you open a Christmas savings account and chip in what you would have spent on the next blue light special.&quot;

&quot;Obviously you have never had a neighbor that allowed their dog to bark for hours and hours, day in and day out, morning, noon, and night. Believe it or not, there are people that are deaf to their dogs incessant barking. Dogs bark for a reason. For dog owners to allow them to bark for any length of time is neglectful. Neglect is a form of abuse. Abuse is criminal. To liken a dogs incessant barking to children laughing and playing too loudly or birds chirping, is ridiculous.&quot;

 RV, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;While I agree that we all have a right to live in &quot;peace and quiet&quot; in our own homes, if there is an ordinance put on dogs that prevents them from barking, shouldn&apos;t there be an ordinance placed on children who laugh and play too loudly while in their back yard? What about an ordinance on birds for chirping or calling too loudly or too often? Do they deserve to be disposed of because of something that comes to them naturally? I can understand neighbors wanting peace and quiet after 10pm until 8am or so.....but creating a 24 hour ordinance is a little harsh in my opinion. Dogs will bark, children will play, birds will sing, and people will complain. It&apos;s natural.&quot;

&quot;Cb, if there is a yield sign such as the one at the off ramp of Winchester rd to new Circle the fine, to add to that list of those coming off the ramp to check their mirros. There are those who still need to move over to the fast lane as they are approaching and off ramp. You will find this in your drivers ed. book. There are those times during rush hour where this may not always be possible yet by jumping over a lane, those coming off the ramp will have less of a worry. Some folks are just plain stupid by not giving and inch. This is probably how most accidents on new circle get started. For those of us already in the fast lane approaching and off ramp, if you see traffic coming off, help those ppl out by giving some room.&quot;

&quot;The Fayette Family Courts under Judge Philpot. His bias and discrimination have all but erased justice from a position that was created to serve the people. I have written letters to politicians and contacted the local Herald Leader about making what is already well known a public issue and not one has come to my aid. Not one has recongnized that in my case, like so many others, a bitter person is using her children as a tool to aggrevate and disrupt the life of their father just to maintain her chosen, however financially irresponsible, lifestyle. This is not about the needs of the children, as those are met tenfold, it is about a person wanting another to pay for their bad decisions once they cannot handle it. This is the summarized version I assure you and the courts allow this type of behavior all the whild the children suffer. I will not hide behind initials or opinions for I am actively pursuing justice. I have recently written a letter to the governor on these double standards of the person he appointed, as he is directly responsible for how his power is delegated. I would rather justly do the right thing than try to be right and justified. My name is Russ Falkenburg, author/photograher, and you can learn more about what I do on a professional level at http://dreamsinternational.home.insightbb.com. All talk and no action is as discraceful as the things in which you attack on forums such as this.&quot;

&quot;People who don&apos;t even look in the mirror when merging onto new circle road. When you are merging into traffic, you yield to the cars already on the road. People, take a look in the side mirror and slow down and don&apos;t assume that car coming is going to move over or slow down to let your cell phone gabbing butt on.&quot;

&quot;I hope everyone in Lexington will have enough intellect to vote AGAINST the city taking over the water company. Mayor Isaacs admitted &quot;she couldn&apos;t balance her own checkbook several years ago in the Herald Leader.............but SOME elected her mayor anyway, NO THANK YOU to her as Mayor again, OR TAKING OVER THE WATER CO. USE YOUR HEAD PEOPLE!!&quot;

 PB, Lex., KY   |   



 


&quot;Hah! SW - LFUCG can barely manage to operate the services they provide NOW - how in the world could they possibly even think they are nearly competent enough to run a water company. The government should show that it can run its own business before they venture into a world they know nothing about.&quot;

 SJ, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;People who think government can&apos;t do anthing right and that private business is the answer to every problem. Some people don&apos;t wan the city to own the water company because it&apos;s a private business. I&apos;d like to point out that it&apos;s unlike most businesses. For one thing it&apos;s a monopoly. Secondly, it&apos;s also GUARANTEED a 9 percent profit. Not many businesses have those advantages. But RWE wants to keep the company in private hands...anybody&apos;s but Lexington government. I&apos;d rather the city owned it. Then KAWC would think about the service it provides instead of turning a buck.&quot;

&quot;Hey Na, add this to your complaint list. Owners who don clean up after their on let go in other ppl&apos;s yard. There are 2 homes I know that dont clean up after their dog.

&quot;to TC in maysville, in case you did not notice us 68 is considered a safety corridor and is deemed so because there are many traffic deaths on it. the speed limit is clearly posted as 45mph all the way to johnston road. in case you had not noticed there are a lot of areas where cross traffic has to go across 4 lanes of traffic and the median. it is not safe to go faster than 45 on this road, maybe you will be lucky enough to realize that when you are traveling 60 plus mph and cannot stop for that truck and horse trailer going across the road and you smack into it. the signs clearly say 45, so travel 45. apparently the police are not wasting their time or they would not always have someone stopped. ask the people who live on that stretch of road how safe it is for them to pull out of their driveways and across the road with people like you flying down the road. pay your ticket and get over it&quot;

&quot;Bm, while I can undetstand some of your plight about Lexington growing so quick outwards and having land for farmers, what I want to know is how many kids are interested in farming. I dont think there are many in generation X&amp;Y that have any kind of hard work ethic when it comes to physical jobs such as farming. Yet they do have the ethic when it comes to sitting behind a desk in a white collar industry. My point being clubs such as &quot;future farmers and homemakers of america&quot; are now by the wayside. I am from the gen x generation and we were more about video games and mtv. Now its ipod&amp;&quot;TrL&quot;. Farming was about survival, alot of good paying jobs now werent available then. 5am -8-9pm. work days on the farm just doesnt appeal alot to today&apos;s youth. The young flee the small town&apos;s once the hit the big city. Ppl only go back to small town life to escape crime in these cities or find cheaper homes. This leaves basically unkept land. Unkept land=developer&apos;s dream. Lexington like alot of other cities is just a &quot;prime&quot; as you mention area to develop due to so much farm land that was available. Look at atlantic station as you mentioned. Was this area just an abandoned warehouse and factories or was it farmland as well. Just something to think on.&quot;

 SL, Lex, KY   |   



 


&quot;Incumbent politicians - re-elect NO ONE. When folks can&apos;t get the job done correctly, they get fired. Time to fire the government and hire (vote-in) some new officials. Actual leaders might be nice for a change.

&quot;lexington ky is a joke,i mean,talk about global warming,all they want to do is,take everybody&apos;s farm land and turn it into a shoping mall,like the economy is all that good,besides,take a look at all of the concrete,asphalt,high rise reflecting glass buildings that also have asphalt roofs,and not only lexington,but all other major cities accross the world,so my opinion is this about lexington ky,dig up the concrete and give the land back to the farmers,bacause later down the road all of us will need something to eat,so how will you grow it with farms to grow on ?&quot;

&quot;I am still waiting to see what is in store for the property currently wasted by the Lexington Mall. I strongly believe that Saul Holdings, LP (the current owner) should start noting the impact - and benefit - that mixed-use sites, such as Atlantic Station (www.atlanticstation.com) in Atlanta, have had on their communities. The property at Lexington Mall is PRIME for such a redevelopment - imagine a large-scale site with pedestrian-friendly streets, store-fronts and entertainment venues. Additionally, offices, condos and other spaces could be placed above those on street level, offering a multi-tiered self-sustaining community. I would hate to see such an area as the Lexington Mall fall further to the wayside. It&apos;s time for Lexington to WAKE UP! and get modernized.&quot;

&quot;People who blame others.

 LV, Lexingtton, KY   |   



 


&quot;The people on this board are ticking me off. Do you people realize that bitching on the Internet accomplishes nothing, while at the same time upsetting those who don&apos;t agree with others&apos; opinions. We all have different ideas, views, beliefs, goals, etc., yet as Lexington residents, or Kentucky/US citizens, we have lost sight of what is important to us. I don&apos;t want to blame anyone, so I won&apos;t. I will offer solutions instead: 1. Politics: we must stop the association of everything involved in daily life being either Republican or Democrat. The current administration has unfortunately created this riff in our culture for a reason. Its only common sense people...do you not remember how you felt on 9/11, no matter what your views were. It&apos;s a tragedy. Lots of people died - white, black, hispanic, asian, gay, straight, republican, democrat, independant, etc. But we cannot become reactionaries. Everyone needs to focus on what is important in the state, nation, and world - spread of Islamic fundamentalism, Darfur, third world hunger (these things are linked to terrorism - when people are oppressed and hungry, they will turn to any means necessary, even terrorism). Open your eyes and be pro-active people. 2. Traffic: I loved reading everyones traffic stories....they all happen to all of us. Here is my solution: turn your radio on louder than your phone (you&apos;ll miss the calls, then return them once you reach your destination) and get a stress ball to squeeze when you get pissed. It works, I swear. 3. Separation of Church and State: Not everyone is religious; not everyone is the same religion. What you believe is what YOU believe. We all have individual beliefs. You may NEVER agree with other people&apos;s beliefs, and you do have the right to say what you want about it, but where is the pro-activeness in that. Just because you can say something doesn&apos;t mean you should. PS: UK and the horse industry are both important to the local economy. Lexington should embrace these industries and the people that come along with them. PS2: Lexington MUST embrace UK and the Town and Gown efforts to create a better college town environment. A college town not only embraces the school and its students, but local citizens can continue education, have a vibrant Arts scene, good LOCAL busineses, etc. PS3: NO MORE WALMARTS OR BIG BOX STORES- WE DON&quot;T NEED ANYMORE AND THEY ARE KILLING OUR KENTUCKY COMMUNITIES BY PUTTING LOCALS OUT OF BUSINESS. WE MUST PLAN AROUND OUR FUTURE NEEDS WHILE REMAINING MINDFUL OF CURRENT PROBLEMS.&quot;

&quot;Over 30 thousand killed on our highway EACH YEAR ! Many due to alcohol served in bars like the ones in Lexington. Maybe we shoud stop driving. Is this equivilant to a War on our highways ? How about some national memorials to the dead or protest outside the presidents vacation home. I will bet more lives are adversly affected by auto related deaths, than by people dying to serve their country. They are proud to serve and their sacrifice has meaning.

These people have not even been examined by the coroner, and yet the entire state of Kentucky, including the families of the victims get to see the details of this horrible event. What ever happened to HUMAN rights and privacy? Do these things even have a place in today&apos;s world? My heart and prayers are with the families of the victims, and in times like these, we should all be greatful for the things God has given us. Lexington is a wonderful community of people and I have no doubt that we will once again help the victims of this tragedy, as we did with the Katrina victims. Rest in peace flight 5191. God bless the families and friends of the victims. I hope you will each find peace some day. WE WILL NOT FORGET YOU.&quot;

&quot;I agree with TR from Lexington. We have way too many large potholes in Lexington. I have lived here for twenty years now, and I&apos;ve never seen the roads this bad. A lot of the potholes are so big that they can throw your car out of alignment.&quot;

&quot;What the heck is the deal with people stopping at the light at the end of Vine street when it continues into Richmond road? The sign at the end of that road does not mean stop! If my memory serves me, that road sign means LANE CONTINUATION. If this is wrong, PLEASE someone tell me, because I may owe half of the people on this page a BIG FAT &quot;I AM SORRY, I NEED DRIVING LESSONS!&quot; LOL!! I hate being wrong, but I would really hate to be one of THOSE drivers. You guys know what I mean.&quot;

&quot;Cb, I share some of your feelings. But also think about. Its always been said that Republicans only care for the rich and welthy. 10-20 years ago this would be a large section of White Americans. Other than a Republican president in Lincoln releasing the slaves its always been thought by African Americans that republicans only catered to the Rich and White society. While democrats played to African Americans interests. Thus bringing your socials issues such as welfare, affirmaitve action, and so on to the table. Heck, take a look at Bill Clinton&apos;s history with the black population. Some African AMericans do look up to Condi as an inspiration to what you can become most likely they are also mentioning to do it on the democratic ticket. I respect her&amp;Colin Powell. It sucks that there is such feelings like that from our friend but there are ppl who felt the same way about Clinton playing to African American interest. Republicans are now trying to get more of the black vote. Question is which black vote are they playing for. Is it the rich side or poverty and crime level. The population layout has changed and neither side really doesnt know who to play to. Right now Republicans are playing to latinos and African Americans.... Those who are rich and do not believe in abortion. Democrats are still scrathing their heads over what went wrong in 2004. This year will be interesting. I would love to see a 3rd party really shake things up and make it interesting.&quot;

&quot;Hey Cb, trust me, I may not have C- education like GWB from Yale University but I&apos;m no Idiot. Actually it wasn&apos;t me where &quot;idiot&quot; saga came from. Look at websites such as &quot;Youtube&quot; and it will show you a nice collection of our fearless leader of this &quot;Great Nation of Ours&quot;. It was actually a fellow former Republican, Joe Scarborough (I assumed you thought it was a liberal talk show host) who hosted this topic on his show on Msnbc. The clips of the president speaking or trying trying to answer can only make you shake your head or just drop to the floor laughing. Do I need to go back to the first debate? I&apos;m not sure where the &quot;thanks&quot; to him would come from that you speak of unless you were one of those Generous contributors who received that nice tax relief check. I&apos;m sorry but this man is no Reagan, heck he isnt even on the same level as his daddy even if he is a 2 term id**t. And my right to speak my mind is having blood getting spilled over in a country where we still dont know anymore why we are there expect to prevent the chaos we already created. My right was also defended in World War 2 when a true mad man took over a continent and when 13 colonies sat together and made the law out on a piece of paper. So I appreciate my right to speak, thank you very much as our president slowly and slick as he can takes aways those rights through his patriot act and &quot;matter of national&quot;security unwritten wiretaping laws. SL.... P.S. Dont forget to really think about who you chose as your next Mayor, Govenor, President or even the P.T.A. President. Cause they make the decisions that can really change your life for at least 4 years if not forever.&quot;

&quot;With all the hype of revitalizing downtown, why is there many times no place to park affordably or even free. In the sprawling downtown Cincinnati, there is city parking for only $1. With only meters and high price day parking in downtown Lexington, it is no wonder that people nor businesses can locate downtown. With the beauty of downtown Lexington, it needs more than just lawyer and government offices. Why is there no boutiques, more restaurants, museums, etc? Look at how Louisville is doing with all of its downtown development. Let&apos;s get DOWN Lexington!!!&quot;

&quot;I really don&apos;t have a title or one word that can describe this; so please just hear me out. I am white. I have a friend who is also white. She could be described as a &quot;light feminist and conscious of the struggles of African-Americans in our society.&quot; kinda gal. I&apos;d like to consider myself in the same category, although some may disagree. Anyway, this friend and I were having a politcal conversation a while back, and I was discussing how I believe Condi Rice would be a great candidate for president, for a variety of reasons. She&apos;s intelligent, sticks to her guns, shares some of the same politcal opinions as myself, is a woman, and black. All aspects that differentiate her from the same ole-same ole. My friend, an avid Hillary supporter, looked at me and said &quot;Condi is too assimilated&quot;. I couldn&apos;t believe it. That is the most vile and racist remark I&apos;ve ever heard. Not until recently have I started thinking about this again, and would love to start the conversation over, but it made me so angry that I have avoided this person altogether. I want to know why she has that opinion? Condi is an American; is there a certain way she should speak and act? I honestly believe that black people are expected to behave a certain way, otherwise they are categorized as &quot;Uncle Toms&quot; or some garbage like that. It&apos;s people like her that &quot;define races&quot; that are the true racists in this country. Sure, Condi doesn&apos;t speak in Ebonics and she works with a bunch of old white guys all the time, but she is a REAL politician, and unlike Hillary, didn&apos;t have to hitch a ride on her husbands coat tails to get somewhere in life. One more thing: the moment we STOP differentiating ourselves using methods like Affirmative Action and other prejudicial crap like it, people will start seeing that we really are WHAT WE ARE: HUMAN BEINGS.&quot;

&quot;Lack of responsibility, on all fronts. This will tick A LOT of people off, but bancruptcy, abortion, welfare - these all contribute to the economic and moral failure of our community and nation, and it&apos;s pathetic. The U.S. has went from a nation of greatness to a nation adolescents with no direction. People always expect something they have no right to, or have not earned. This country offers too many opportunities for people to complain they can&apos;t get ahead. Complete BS. If we aren&apos;t careful, the government will start controlling every aspect of our daily lives, and we won&apos;t be able to make decisions for ourselves. Although I have a feeling that this city has some communists that would LOVE to see that happen.&quot;

&quot;Speeding and running red lights. In Calgary Alberta they have it sort of under control. They have police on bikes, Motor cycles, cars and van that have hand held radar devices. They also have portable speed traps where they park a car and it measures your speed and if its to fast takes a picture of driver and license plate you get a ticket. They also have devices installed at intersections with traffic lights to determine if you go through red light. The net results is less speeding and less going through red lights which equals less accidents which equals lower insurance rates&quot;

&quot;Waiter(s), workers,,,anyone that complains about their job and stays in it. Hey &quot;DH&quot; if your going to complain about 15% gratuity...Then get a different job! This is a capitalistic society, therefore you dont have to be a waiter if you dont want too. Quit complaining about your job!! &quot; Whatever! Have you ever tried waiting on cheap people that just demand ranch and sweet tea all night??? Sometimes, education alone will not get you a job, you have to hoof it in a restaurant. Speaking from experience, i went from server to management in 10 years with a great company. But, i had an education the whole time. It is hard to get a job without experience. WE complain because most of us are worth more than 15% and half of the time you are lucky to get 10%.&quot;

&quot;Just about everything is &quot;ticking&quot; me off these days. Gas prices, leadership, corruption, traffic lights, rude people, high cost of insurance, healthcare costs, etc. I can agree with just about everything posted here. Our first reaction is fustration and anger...which turns into complaining. Is complaining a solution....or an action to relieve stress for the moment? Has anyone&apos;s complaining really &quot;fixed&quot; any of these issues? Think about this for a moment. What if during rush hour, everyone parked their cars and got out and prayed? What if everyone prayed before filling up with gas? What if someone was very rude to you and you stopped in your tracks and prayed for them? What would happen? I believe it certainly would draw a lot of attention. Not just to the problem, but concern for the first step in a solution. Am I a minister or preacher? No, only a witness. I died a few years ago and got to &quot;return.&quot; I was not a Christian up until then, but have become one since. Why? Because there is a higher power out there. I am only grateful that I got to witness it firsthand and return from death. The first thing shown to me when I died was how the devil &quot;robs&quot; us of time. Don&apos;t we do plenty of that compaining? Think I&apos;m crazy? Five years ago, I would have completely agreed with you. Just think about how many hours a week you spend cursing at all the issues in Lexington. The evil one smiles upon seeing your anger, because now you have only stirred up the problem instead of praying for a solution......&quot;

&quot;Ok, Show if a well paying job above $10.00 supposedly these illegals are stealing..... Didnt think so. They are working the jobs that most poor whites and African Americans are working such as Fast food, janitorial, hotels. Remember years ago before Bush these places couldnt even get enough ppl interested to go in a fill an application. Fast food were throwning bonuses. Now they cant keep them away. The only problem i have with illegals is to come here and get the services we pay for for free such as healthcare&amp;education. Deport those already here... No. But they must be identified and put in thr system like the rest of us. and an action plan is developed for them to becoem citizens or go back. To deport them would create a vast amount of chaos within our already troubled economy. Mexians dont steal our jobs. The country of India does. But deep down, from the top ceo on down. WE are all getting overpaid and very greedy. The new secretary of treasury made more money as the top executive for Goldman Sachs in only 2 days than what he will make for his entire salary as the treasury secretary.&quot;

&quot;RC, rock on! I totally agree with everything you said. They definately are taking our jobs out of our hands because they don&apos;t mind getting paid very little to do it. And yes, they do more jobs than just bagging leaves and mowing. I might add, I have a few friends who have lawn mowing businesses, and they make pretty decent money. Are they going to be undermined by these mexicans who are so uneducated that they&apos;ll do back breaking work for 5 bucks? It&apos;s isn&apos;t right!! Who cares about leaves..they biodegrade anyway. I don&apos;t want to have to be required to know spanish or some other language in order to get a job. They need to learn english. This country isn&apos;t great, it&apos;s just the best there is right now. Un employment is through the roof, gas prices are too high.

&quot;JS, I would like to say that although RC&apos;s comment does have a prejudice tinge, it is very hypocritical of you to suggest this person is a racist. &quot;Racist&quot; is a very strong and negative label, and by RC labeling illegal immigrants in a negative light, you (JS) are no better than RC for putting a label on a person you obviously do not know. It seems both of you need to rethink your opinions before posting them on a public site. Illegal immigrants come in all races, not just Mexican. They can be white, black, brown, yellow, and all the colors of the human rainbow. The beauty of our country is that we are FREE, and that we do have diversity. That is why so many people from all over the world want to come here, but our government has, for the last fifty years, done a poor job of controlling the situation. Does seeking a diverse state mean that we should open our borders to any and all that want to live here? Isn&apos;t that dangerous? Yes, immigration does need to be controlled, not only for the safety of the immigrants, to protect them from evil behaviors (drug and human trafficking, to name a few) but to also protect our country from negative forces (terrorism, drugs, crime, etc.) Politicians should provide easier and better means for immigrants to enter this country safely, so they aren&apos;t labelled &quot;criminals&quot; the instant they step foot in our country. A better method should and can be found, but fighting and bickering will not solve the problem. Take an active but positive voice in your community to speak for what you believe, but first become educated so that you can articulate your opinions in a manner that people will actually want to listen.&quot;

 CB, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I&apos;m curious to know if the R in RC stands for racist. It&apos;s called diversity and one of the things that makes America great. And for the jobs that they are still from us, they keep our road ways clean and a truck will come to your house and mow the lawn for 5 dollars. Are these the jobs your upset about missing out on? Chill out and don&apos;t take life to seriously.. you&apos;ll never get out alive.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m really tired of the ILLEGAL Mexicans that are in this city as well as the rest of our country. They are taking jobs away from the people that really belong here.(Americans). This city seems as though it is catering to these people that have no business being here. First of all they are in our country illegally. Second of all they are taking jobs away from Americans that deserve the jobs.You know, people like you and me, Tax Paying Americans!!! Third, we are providing benefits (both medical and financial) to these illegal people. Fourth, why do we, as English speaking Americans have to drive around Lexington and in some areas see the advertisements in store windows written in Spanish? This is not Mexico or have our city fathers forgotten that?If we would all protest this maybe the pressure could be put on the elected officials to do something about this growing problem unless you unlike myself want Santa Anna&quot;s boys to end up controlling this country. I&apos;m all for the Border Patrol.Maybe its time for Kentucky to follow the example of our border states and start doing something about this BIG problem.&quot;

&quot;People who are healthy and able to work solely depending upon government assistance. Why aren&apos;t more hard-working, tax-paying Americans upset about this? For example: My teenage brother is a cashier at a grocery store chain, and he has already become disgusted at the number of slackers and beggars we have in our community, well before he&apos;s even turned 18! Please do not consider my comments entirely cruel; I do agree that there are many people who desperately need public assistance to live, and do not categorize those less-fortunate as a burden on our society. However there are the masses that have been taught that mooching off the public is the only way to live, and these people in turn will teach their children these same ways. How much money is wasted on government-aid moochers every year? And is it not enough that the same people are destroying our public school system? ALL races are to blame for this disgrace. People who abuse the system need to be penalized for their actions, and take some responsibility for their OWN LIVES! Our society would be better as a whole if people were educated and able to take care of themselves.&quot;

&quot;The fact that most (if not all) of the Urban County Council Members campaigned on making Lexington a safer place but when it came time to vote on a budget, they voted to cut out the hiring of 49 police officers and 30 firefighters. They chose to spend it on (among other things) the fountain downtown, upgrading the city parks, and farmland preservation , instead of protecting Lexington&apos;s citizens. When you&apos;re talking about a $400+ million budget, what&apos;s 1 more million when the Police Department and Fire Department are already understaffed? While I agree that the preservation of farmland is very important, what about the safety of Lexington&apos;s citizens? Please, remember this when it&apos;s time to get out and vote in November. Do we really want council members who lie just to get votes?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I usually average anywhere from 65 to 70 mph. What? You don&apos;t come to a complete stop at every stop sign? I usually stay more than 10 feet away. Tailgaters make the people in front of them angry, and if they slam on their breaks, you go crashing into them, its&apos; too risky. You know what guys..fine, you all are right. I&apos;m just going to start running to where I need to go, and let you all be in the wrecks. It&apos;s not my problem anymore. Running in town is great...but running on I75 would suck..eh better to be moving than not i always say.&quot;

&quot;I think its amazing. Every comment made about me, indirectly accused me of saying that I wished the person in the wreck would have died. I NEVER SAID THAT.OMG! I don&apos;t want anyone to die. What I said was, I want him to learn his lesson. If he dies, he can&apos;t learn his lesson can he? Oh, and I appreciate those unfair accusations btw. And no, I have never been in a wreck..EVER.. I obey the laws. I don&apos;t speed. I don&apos;t tailgate, and i don&apos;t weave in and out of traffic like 99% of lexington does. The person that caused the accident. What if he was drinking? What if he was breaking every law known to man to get from A to B? I SAW the wreck on a bridge!!!! And let me tell you,, it was NOT an accident, someone was seriously breaking some laws. Thats the only way that kind of a wreck could have happened.That is why I feel justified in saying, he needs to learn his lesson.&quot;

&quot;I urge Lexingtonians to have more patience with all drivers. One never knows what&apos;s happening in the car in front of or beside you. Thank you to those of you who don&apos;t lay on your horn as soon as a light turns green while I&apos;m turned trying to settle my crying baby. Thank you to those of you who don&apos;t flip me off when I don&apos;t drive fast enough for you. Thank you to those of you who politely motion a car to proceed at a confusing 4-way stop (Landsdown). Lexington is a difficult place to drive and I will never be discourteous to anyone (especially out-of-town drivers) as they try to figure out how to drive around Hamburg or get down Nicholasville Road in the middle of 4:30 lane change on a Friday afternoon.&quot;

&quot;To Whom It May Concern: The thing that ticks me off most is that we have a federal agency called the &quot;FBI&quot;, and another federal agency called, &quot;Homeland Security&quot;, and for the life of me, I cannot secure an email address for either one of them. I checked for the KY division of Homeland Security but still no email address. I could find a &quot;form&quot; to fill in and send to them, but I need an actual email address in order to send the IP Header information of a questionable email that I have received and then to &quot;forward&quot; the original email to them. I may be unusually ignorant, especially when it comes to computers, but what good are these govern&quot;mental&quot; agencies if we cannot reach them quickly when we feel it is or may be necessary to the well being of ourselves and others? Do you know any email address for either of these agencies? If so, would you share them with me please? Thank you very much. Most Sincerely,&quot;

I didn&apos;t get to town till waaay after 5, after everything was closed. Whatever ignoramus caused that wreck, I hope he is reading this. If you are riling in pain right now, you get what you deserve. My plans, along with hundreds of others peoples plans were ruined. The other people involved, you may not be to blame, and i apologize for any pain caused by this idiot. Or everyone may have been involved. They should make it harder to get drivers licenses. No wonder thousands a day die in crashes. Pilots are TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, you hardly hear of plane crashes. They need to make getting a drivers license more complicated than just passing some easy exam and drivers test. IT will weed out idiots.&quot;

&quot;Hey BC from Lebanon, just got back into town. Man, you missed my whole point- and that is the fact of stereotyping everyone. Your words were that the world needs &quot;people like me&quot; and referred to me as a passive tolerant person. After 2 tours in Nam with the Corp., I doubt Charlie would agree with that analysis- and trust me, if the &quot;wolf comes to MY door&quot;, he&apos;s getting ready to have a really bad day. Main point being that you can&apos;t take a few words I&apos;ve quoted and know me- nor can you say that someone who&apos;s made a mistake and paid the price with his freedom, is a bad person. Yeah, it happens, and will continue to happen, but it doesn&apos;t mean ALL of them are bad people. Like you, I think a threat to society should be dealt with accordingly: and generally, they are. We can&apos;t take this into our own hands, because who knows? you yourself may offend someone in someway and they decide that you need to be punished. Also, your reference to Jesus coming down here and fixing this mess- well, he keeps trying but we keep turning away from his teachings (i.e. &quot;Judge not). I&apos;m sure though, he&apos;ll have the last laugh. BC you sound like you have some good ideas, man, but try to judge people as themselves, on an individual basis, without jumping to conclusions. It&apos;s much better when you know the whole story. Have a good one....&quot;

&quot;I agree with CM. Amen! Smoking is disgusting. Being forced to breathe secondhand smoke bothers me because with the Smoking Ban, there is not supposed to be smoking inside retail places, but I see it happen and breathe it everyday. It stinks. This is due to people breaking the law and getting away with it and making the rest of us suffer for it.&quot;

 , Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;I find people that think smoking in a public area is permissible to be simply intolerable. If you want to smoke, that is your unwise decision, but you should not be allowed to harm those around you, such as your children, whom have no choice but to breathe the toxins that smoke contains. Smoking is the cause of an incredible amount of illnesses, and smokers make insurance higher for all. Also, if you will notice, no one who smokes looks well groomed. They each have a grayish cast to their skin, and a very foul odor. Smoking is irresponsible and to be frank, very low class.&quot;

Whether or not you like his stammering style, I admire the courage of Bush&apos;s convictions. Did you ever wonder where we would be if Gore had gotten elected?

&quot;This is to RC of lexington, i can see your point but i want to point out that we as a society shouldnt have to be tolerent of people who burden our society. Murders, rapest, crooks, thieves, hoods,drug dealers, and blights and stains on humanity should not be tolerated. Only people opinions should be tolerated not their actions, its not cls opions i have a problem with its his actions that apparently put him and his fellow felons in this condition which i take offense. And as far as karma goes your statement is very true thats why i build no bad karma with my action, I do whats right and expect everyone else to do the same. the little comment about &quot;judge and lest ye be judged&quot; what i have to say to that is when the person who sat forth the rules and the turn the other cheek mentality wants to come down here and fix whats messed, then ill step back and wont judge and hold people accountable, but until he does then we as a people and society must take actions in our own hands. You seem in your comments like a very tolerant and passive person, and theres nothing wrong with that we need people like that, but when the wolf howls at the door you can either pray for it to go away or make it go away. We also need the makers of the world as well as the prayers. the real truth&quot;

Ben Chandlers weekly votes in The House? Voted against drilling in Anwar and against building nuclear facilities.

&quot;This is for cl and his concernfor the poor jobless felons.

Poor Poor ex-cons i think the real problem here is the ex in front of con. Cause in my observance of the world people who are out of prison, really dont need to be, or at least 90% percent. The last thing you said in your statement says it all.......So you dont have to resort to crime as an income. Well if you had never resorted to that in the first place we wouldnt even be having this conversation now would we? Any way i wasted enough of my time on trash who dont deserve it.

We all have issues that are important to us and we all want to be heard and want to matter. Why not pursue knowledge, try to figure some of these problems out, and work together? Don&apos;t think you could ever talk to someone from the other side of the &quot;thought&quot; tracks, let alone try to understand them? Then that&apos;s really a shame. LOOK AT HOW MUCH WE CAN AGREE ON, NO MATTER &quot;WHAT&quot; YOU ARE..... Lexington drivers are bad. Lexington isn&apos;t a bad place to live. Downtown could use some more stable economic anchors. We want the Cats to win the big dance again. The LPO is a pretty good orchestra. There are many different options for worship in our town. We have enough subdivisions; save the farmland.

&quot;One thing that really bothers me is when people who are not handicap (or do not have stickers), park in handicap parking spaces. I am disabled and there have been so many times that I needed to be close to a store and all the spaces were taken and some of those parked there didn&apos;t have the sticker. I&apos;ve had to walk while on crutches or in a wheelchair from the other end of the parking lot just because someone who was able to walk wanted the convenience of being close to the store. There were also days where I felt really good and passed up the handicap spaces and parked in regular spaces to be courteous to those who may have felt a lot worse than I did that day.&quot;

&quot;Suburban sprawl!!! I grew up in Winchester and love the drive between there and Lexington. I moved to Lexington three years ago but I still love the country drives and the land around this city. But we keep letting developers build miles of subdivisions and just more of the same every time the Urban Service Area is expanded. Lexington is one HUGE suburb of nothing with it&apos;s little downtown core. Lets put development there and support development there by shopping and living there. If we do that maybe we&apos;ll see a vibrant exciting city surrounded by beautiful land rather than a giant suburb that&apos;s destroyed the famrland around it. That&apos;s why I only shop inside New Circle if I can help it. I dont want to support sprawl, and my money will support development inside the Circle.&quot;

&quot;Democratic Liberals......This country is founded on our fore fathers and their trust in God. Supporting homosexuals and abortion is not in the best interest of our country which needs to stay focused on God. You can see people around this city and nation everyday searching for the &quot;greener grass&quot;, however they never put their faith and trust in God. We are very lucky to still be surrounded by communities that have people who stand for God and who know the difference between right and wrong. I am not attempting to condone anyone, I am simple saying that the farther we stray from the path of rightousness, the worse off we become. I will agree that politics is very corrupt within each party, but I am apalled at the ungodly acts that the Democratic party has been standing up for. Those who understand right from wrong can on stay focused on the original American dream and pray to God for the these individuals. We are on this earth to multiply and to prepare for our eternity. I ask you to stop and consider how short this life is and where you will be when you leave this earth.&quot;

Alot has changed since then and things have improved but its just a shame before i see New Circl Road expanded to 3 lanes. or some New freeway get put up around the city since it seems to continue to expand. Baesler, Miller&amp;Issac I dont feel have done anything for Lexington except hold it back from competing to the likes of CIncinnati and Louisville.

&quot;LO, you hit the nail on the head. It took my mother and I 15 minutes to get from the Cancer Center on campus over to Ramsey&apos;s on the corner of Woodland and High Street. The red lights are ridiculous in Lexington. We need a three digit interstate route running through town, around town, or something. When other cities need something done, it gets done. If the building, highway, or whatever is blocking somebody view (or they simply just don&apos;t like it much) then it is just tough luck. I mean, Bowling Green might be getting a three digit interstate route to help with their traffic congestion...Last time I checked, Lexington has a worse traffic problem right now, will have a worse traffic problem in the future, and is more populated than Bowling Green. The fact that we don&apos;t have any MAJOR road projects under consideration is absurd!&quot;

&quot;Who has their hands in the landlords pocket? I know one landlord made this comment to a student renting from him.

The herbie cop issues 3 tickets a day. I called in fortytwo last week in one hour. I am sick of the trashey landlords. As a group we need to start sueing.&quot;

&quot;The EXTREMELY long (2+ minutes at some intersections) traffic lights. I&apos;m sure the length serves some purpose but it is lost on me when I cannot travel 2-3 miles in less than 20 minutes. Someone mentioned the lack of bypass options; I&apos;ve traveled twice as far in half the time in larger cities on bypass highways so that might be part of the problem. It just seems excessive to wait that long for a traffic light.&quot;

I know there are good legal and or illegal immigrants here, but enough is enough. We have to close our borders and not allow anymore immigrants in the US. period.&quot;

&quot;Nothing ticks me off but I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s hilarious. What is hilarious is watching all these Libs get all hysterical when a conservative disagrees with them. They should chill out a little, maybe get a couple more cats or something. Or maybe they could have a meeting at that big CORPORATE coffee chain that they love so much and hug each other and stuff. HA HA! Hey when you guys do that can I come?&quot;

&quot;PEOPLE!! LEARN HOW TO TIP YOUR SERVERS THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE IN A RESTUARANT!!! I work at Fire Mountain which is an all you can eat buffet, i may not serve you food but remember, i do have to bring you drinks and clean up after your mess and your kids!! it is ridiculous how some people can be so cold hearted about tipping just because they are broke or forget or think you don&apos;t desrve one!! if you can afford to go out and eat, you can also afford a couple more dollars to thank the people that have to clean up after your mess. Would you treat your own mother like that?! If you would, then you need to stay home and clean up after your own crap! Geez! I&apos;m not saying that every server is the best in the world, even if they are awful, leave them something! People have good and bad days, it&apos;s part of being human, but being paid only $2.13 an hour can not pay the bills. I know some may say &quot;get a better paying job&quot;, but i like serving. it&apos;s one of the best occupations around if you are a people person. But it gets tough when heartless people come in a leave you crappy tips or just simply stiff you all together. GET A CLUE! it&apos;s simply just rude! if you can afford the meal, you can afford to leave a little something for the server who has to clean up after you.&quot;

 CH, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;1) I don&apos;t know if anyone on here is a server, but I totally disagree on the whole $2.13 an hour crap. I know that most of you wages comes from customers who come in to eat but what about the extra work that you do for your employer? I mean really, you do a lot more than just serve food. You are also running garbage and plates and stocking...etc. I think that servers should be paid at leat $5- $5.65 an hour at least. When the restuarant is slow, how are you garuanteed to make any money?? 2) I think that the welfare office and officials should conduct an investigation of claims and as well on food stamp claims. there is a lot of illegal activity going on in lexington regarding people who are just too darn lazy to work, pay bills, and buy food. it is ashamed that people can lay down and have kids but they cant get up and go to work. they have enough money to get high, but they can&apos;t go to work. it is simply ridiculous. if you ask me, i&apos;m sick of paying taxes to ensure that someone else&apos;s bills get paid when i know for a fact they are simply just too lazy to get up and get a job. it&apos;s crazy that some person and have no work history and have 6 kids and get all of their bills paid but for the other hard working individuals, we can get turned away if we happen to hit a bump in the road and need a little bit of help because we &quot;make too much money!&quot; it is simple, if you can lay around and have kids and get high, then find the time to get up and get a job and let the other people who really need the help, get the benefits!! 3) everyone needs to hang up and DRIVE! it&apos;s crazy how many people are on their phones in the car! i mean really, do you want your obituary to read &quot;cause of death: on phone while driving?&quot; DUH! it&apos;s simple, call the person back when you are not behind the wheel of your car! 4) everyone needs to slow down when it is raining. there is nothing that darn important to have to go over the speed limit while the roads are slick! god gave everyone brains for a reason. it is simply up to you to know how and when to use it!&quot;

&quot;Hey there SL, don&apos;t get all worked up bb is talking about people turning like on side streets and stuff, stopping to turn!!! hello! Anyways, I&apos;ll put my 2cents in now..things that tick me off? 1) DRUGGIES/DEADBEATS HAVING CHILDREN 2)ANIMAL ABUSE 3)PEOPLE WHO WANT THE FOREIGNERS TO GO HOME, GOD SAID IT&apos;S ALL ONE WORLD ---NOT YOUR COUNTRY, AND YOURS ALONE 4) BAD/NEGLEGANT DRIVERS (SPECIFICALLY AT US25 N AND 421N IN BEREA) 5) UK BASKETBALL 6) THE MONEY HUNGRY CORPORATIONS WHO RIP US OFF ON OUR PAYCHECK 7) PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THIS WEBSITE TO ARGUE ABOUT STUPID CRAP, THINK THEY ARE GENUISES AND CAN&apos;T EVEN SPELL!!! GET A LIFE!!!!&quot;

&quot;YOU BIG DUMMY!!! THE REASON THAT PEOPLE COME TO A COMPLETE STOP BEFORE TURNING RIGHT, IS MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE OCTAGONAL RED STOP SIGN TO YOUR RIGHT!!! MAN, ARE YOU FROM HICKTOWN OR WHAT??? OH, I FORGOT. THEY DON&apos;T HAVE STOP SIGNS WHERE YOU ARE FROM, RIGHT. MAYBE YOU NEED TO RE-TAKE YOUR PERMIT OR EVEN YOU DRIVERS TEST OVER... GOSH........&quot;

 SL, LEXINGTON, KY   |   



 


&quot;I have to agree with everyone here who has a beef with traffic. I would like to add my two cents. First of all, the little white lines they paint on the street are there for a reason you need to drive in between them.!! I also agree if you are not going to drive the limit on that street move over. One more thing I would like to add also for all you country bumkins who drive on the back road stay in your lane!!! Do not drive on the lines. Do not drive on the other side of the road on a straight road or a curve!! I do not want to be killed because of your driving. Sorry one more why do you people need to make a complete stop when you make a right hand turn?? Not in less your driving a semi into a alley is the only time you would need to slow down that much. Not a happy driver :(&quot;

&quot;The lack of any real bypasses within town. It&apos;s impossible to go 5 miles in less than 20-30 minutes. New Circle and MOW do not function as intended, due to the multiple traffic lights and lack of dedicated right and left turn lanes in many places.&quot;

 ND, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Like some others here, the completely irresponsible driving: going 10 mph below the speed limit on major roads, sweeping across several lanes at once, turning from the wrong lane, not turning right on a red, swerving while eating/talking on cell phone/putting on makeup. Driving is a responsibility that folks should take seriously.&quot;

 AD, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;People who are determined to make a turn from the wrong lane. They will hold up traffic forever instead of just staying in their lane, going up a ways and turning around. Twice I have been cut off in the left hand lane because somone wanted to turn left from the right hand lane. At least use your turn signal if you want over in my lane. Lucky for you I was paying attention or we would have wrecked and it would have been your fault.&quot;

&quot;Are you willing to pay higher prices on everything to get rid of illegals ??? Americans will not work for minimum wage , just try to find someone you know whos does. Corporatins will not accept lower proffits because of higer wages. this translates to higher prices for everybody. What is the real cost os stopping illegal immigration?&quot;

 JC, lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;1. Illegal immigrants and the burden they place on the american economy by reproducing like rabbits and expecting our tax dollars to educate and raise their kids, some of them are paid under the table in farm/construction labor jobs and pay no taxes and don&apos;t even care enough to learn our language. 2. George Bush and Gas Prices. Technically, people deserve what they are getting now b/c all of the bible thumpers voted for Bush and the Republicans, Gas prices are ridiculous, the Iraq war is dragging America down and we are losing jobs in America at an alarming rate, the rich are getting richer and the middle class are getting it in the wazoo 3. Celebrities, i&apos;m tired of all of their stupid pregnancies, tomkitten, bennifer, brangelina, all that b.s. and all of the attention paid to them on t.v., I wish to hell they would all move to Africa and stay and adopt the whole country b/c i&apos;m sick of everyone of their a**es. That&apos;s all for now, I feel better y&apos;all.&quot;

&quot;GW Do you really believe a 15 story building is really a location for Broadway and high street. I want downtown to grow more than anyone but this paticular building is not the answer. I wouldnt be suprised if a landslide happened at that location. Dont believe look at all the cracks at the parking garage at pnc bank. Heck the best thing to do is for Lcc to sell lease some of their land, Build a huge Parking structure to make up what is lost and allow another hotel to be built at that location. It cab be done easliy, look at what louisville and Cincinnati has accomplished so far. There so land behind the Lexington center they thought about putting a baseball stadium there. I believe something should still be put there.&quot;

&quot;Politicians. Period. Just once I&apos;d like to see a politician with an agenda besides money. It&apos;s all about the cash. Reelection is the god they worship. Our &quot;governor&quot; speaks to a bunch of school kids on a self proclaimed &quot;Diversity Day&quot; just hours after he revamps the state hiring guidelines to remove equal oportunity protections for gays. Says he&apos;s gonna clean up the mess in Frankfort...then proceeds to helm an administration that&apos;s crookeder than a dogs hind leg. Talk about hypocrisy!! Our so called &quot;leaders&quot; are failing us at every turn. Our president takes us into a war based on lies, then calls anyone who questions him a &quot;traitor&quot;. He then proceeds to completely fracture our constitution by spying on US citizens for whatever reasons he sees fit. He says leaking classified information is despicable....while he&apos;s busy authorizing leaks to &quot;get&quot; his enemies. Meanwhile, congressional types run around taking every bribe they can get their grubby hands on from the Jack Abramhoffs of the world. It&apos;s time for a new American Revolution!! If we don&apos;t take our government back soon, it&apos;s gonna be far too late.&quot;

&quot;The inability of my fellow countrymen to see past their noses. Why do we feel the need to reproduce @ a staggering rate which is totally out of balance with our resources? Why do we allow unemployed junkies to continue to produce child after child with no means of providing for them and no intent of caring for them? Why don&apos;t use utilize semi-permanent sterilization until they can get their life together and take care of the children they&apos;ve lost to foster parents? And, WHY, for that matter is it so expensive to adopt? And what&apos;s the big deal with mexicans coming into the states? How many canadians are here? Doesn&apos;t Mexico have any resources that we can benefit from?&quot;

&quot;The marching by illegals is just political BLACKMAIL. Whats next they march so they don&apos;t have to pay taxes, don&apos;t have to have car insurance, don&apos;t need drivers license? We hear a lot about saving energy how much energy do 11 million illegals use?? The Democrats and Republicians leaders don&apos;t have to worry about the illegals taking their job. How many of these illegals are terrorist? If they don&apos;t respect one of our laws why would they respect the others. Parents think about your kids and grandkids future. Don&apos;t sell their future short. Have you noticed everywhere you go its crowded. We don&apos;t need any illegals. If the CEO&apos;s in America didn&apos;t take all the money the other employees at the bottom of the ladder could make enough to have a decent living. CEO GREED has takend over and our government does nothing about it.&quot;

&quot;That i submitted a comment that spoke more actual truths than all these ramblings combined and it is being censored. Also, how our local politicians are using public safety as their main platform and how they have supported and will increase their support public safety yet when you look at what they did when we were losing police officers and firefighters, none of them took measures to do anything about it, not until collective bargaining passed and they were forced to do something. Granted, TI fought the passage of collective bargaining for public safety in the state but once it passed she supported them full force. People like Cegelka and Farmer tried to use her support against her at the time, and now suddenly take credit for making things better.&quot;

&quot;why is it that mexicans praise their country so much , but want to come to America so much. maybe if their government would attempt to make it into a stable economy, they would not want to leave. so go to the good old U.S.A&gt;, earn money, send it to Mexico, screw the U.S. economy and then want to have every right available to all U.S. citizens . policy makers and citizens need to wake up and realize that our country is being given away.&quot;

&quot;If the Federal Government allows illegals to stay in this country what kind of message is this going to send to the rest of the world. Go to Mexico illegally cross the border into the US and stay nothing would be done. If illegals are so great why is the conditions so bad in their country.&quot;

&quot;Republican and Democratic politicians who think nothing of exploiting base emotions to advance their careers. We seem to have more than our fair share of these bottom-feeders here in Kentucky. Also, posters who shout (write in all caps) and those who hit &quot;share your opinion&quot; before going over what they&apos;ve written to be certain they really want to make the statements they&apos;re making. For example, I notice one here who thinks the Newtown Pike Extension project is a recent concept. Hello yourself, sir. This thing has been in the works for nearly two decades! And finally, another who views Lexington as &quot;unfriendly??&quot; Evidently this person hasn&apos;t lived anywhere else...&quot;

&quot;THE DUMB DRIVERS!!! FIRST OFF, HANG UP YOUR PHONES AND PAY ATTENTION TO DRIVING!! SECOND IF THE SPEED IS OVER 35 ON ANY ROAD DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PULL OUT FROM A SIDE STREET IN FRONT OF SOMEONE!! HOW FAST DO YOU THINK I CAN STOP MY VEHICLE WHEN I AM DOING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 45??? THINK PEOPLE!! ANOTHER ONE IS IF YOU ARE DRIVING ON THE STREET DO NOT REPEAT DO NOT STOP THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC TO LET SOMEONE IN OR GET TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET. PAST UP THE STREET AND TURN AROUND THERE IS TRAFFIC LIGHT EVERY STONES THROW AWAY, IT ONLY TAKES A MINUTE OR TWO. RICHMOND RD NICHOLASVILLE RD HARRODSBURG RD TATESCREEK IS NOT A PARKING LOT (MOST OF THE TIME) IT IS A STREET WHERE TRAFFIC SHOULD FLOW NOT BE STOPPED!!! REMEMBER SLOWER TRAFFIC TO RIGHT SIDE NOT ALL THREE LANES!! IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE OVER THE SPEED LIMIT MOVE!!!! IT&apos;S NOT HARD JUST MOVE OVER. THATS WHAT THE ROAD OF THE ROAD BOOKLETS SAYS, SLOWER TRAFFIC TO RIGHT. OK EMERGENCY VEHICLES IF IT IS ON OTHER SIDE OF STREET KEEP DRIVING, UNLESS IT CANNOT GET BY ON THEIR SIDE OF THE ROAD. NOW IF IT IS ON YOUR SIDE TRY TO MOVE OUT OF HIS WAY LOOK&amp;LOOK;AGAIN BEFORE YOU MOVE OVER, AND DON&apos;T I REPEAT DON&apos;T PULL YOUR VEHICLE IN THE &quot;EMPTY&quot; TURN LANE MOST LIKELY THATS WHERE IT WILL GO!!!!! IF YOU ARE THE FIRST CAR AT A LIGHT THATS RED AND IT HAS NO WHERE TO GO MOVE!!!! OK NOW ACCIDENTS IF YOU ARE NOT IN IT, KEEP MOVING I REPEAT KEEP MOVING IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN IT KEEP MOVING AND PULL OVER AFTER IT. DO NOT BLOCK OTHERS, THERE ALREADY IS A BLOCKED LANE OR SO DON&apos;T MAKE IT WORSE KEEP MOVING AND PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOT THEM. IF SOMEONE BEEPS OR FLASHES THERE LIGHTS AT YOU THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THEY ARE JUST ASKING YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING. NO HARM DONE. THATS WHAT DRIVING IS ALL ABOUT PAYING ATTENTION AND BEING FOCUS ON THE ROAD AND YOUR SURROUNDING. I DRIVE A FEW DAYS A WEEK AND EVERYDAY I SEE ONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN, WEATHER IT HAPPENS TO ME OR SOMEONE ELSE. PLEASE PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING BEFORE IT&apos;S TOO LATE. REMEMBER WE CAN ONLY GO FORWARD IN THIS LIFETIME WE CANNOT GO BACK AND TAKE SOMETHING BACK WE DID.&quot;

&quot;Homeowners recieving services from &quot;contractors&quot; that are not properly licensed, do not pay taxes, are not insured, give industries a black eye and cause Real Contractors to pay more in taxes and insurance premiums. These homeowners that hire illegal workers are hurting the community by lowering the quality of services provided in order to compete at the rates being paid to uninsured, tax dodging so-called &quot;businesses&quot;. Pay a few more dollars for a Business that doesn&apos;t cut corners complying with regulations. Chances are they won&apos;t cut corners on your project. Run these fly by night businesses out of town by not hiring them just to save yourself a couple of dollars. In the long run it costs us all. A worker that only charges enough to by that 12 pack at the end of the day, probably will drive drunk and run over your kid on the way home from school that he did not help because he didn&apos;t pay any school taxes or city taxes. Want to know why our streets suck! Because people here are only concerned with the cheapest prices and not abot a quality Business that gives back to the community by paying the taxes and giving jobs.&quot;

&quot;The fact that Jason McElwain (The Autistic High School Basketball Hero) wasn&apos;t on the UK team this year. :P Just wanted to lighten the moods here a little bit, it gets really tense and DEEP at times. Seriously though, I agree about the Lex traffic problems and losing all the greenspace. What was the point of fighting for the right to say &quot;HORSE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD&quot; if the greenspace is disappearing?! AND the fact that Teresa Issacs nor DR/GOV. Ernie Fletcher are good for our city or state. Uh-oh! I got myself started on Fletcher... I am a former patient of his and James George&apos;s office and, at the time, they accepted Medicaid insurance. They were always putting down people on Medicaid when they thought they weren&apos;t being heard. They (Drs. George&amp;Fletcher) and their nurses would stand outside the exam rooms and &quot;gossip&quot; and tell their opinions on the lifestyles of Medicaid recipients based on what they &quot;thought&quot; their medical problem was. (How thick did they really think those exam room walls and doors were anyway?) This is no lie, I heard it with my own ears. I knew the person they were talking about and knew they were completely wrong about what kind of person the patient was and btw, they were wrong with the diagnosis too! Anyway, when he announced he was going to run for office of governor, I knew he would be trouble for the state.&quot;

&quot;Able bodied people who think the government ....your and my tax dollars should feed them, clothe them, and pay them for breathing and reproducing. At some point, too many handouts reduce any motivation to work. That gets passed on to another generation. Look at our state of Kentucky. Obesity rampant, smoking rates, cancer, educational levels. We are a poor health state and low in education. IF this is acceptable, then not to worry. IF we love our beautiful state and the goodness of it&apos;s people, we must improve the quality of life for our families and generations to come. That&apos;s my rant. I don&apos;t have the answer. It is sad that we are where we are. No one can instill morality or individual responsibility in another person. Are we satisfied with the condition of the state of our state?&quot;

&quot;Smoking bans. If you don&apos;t like a place because it&apos;s smoker-friendly, do not go there. Business owners should be allowed to decide if they want the lost revenues from alienating either smokers or non-smokers, as some cater to more of one than the other. Again, if it&apos;s so terrible for you, then find an Applebees or some other sterile environment to consume your artery-clogging foods and liver-killing liquor whilst preserving your lungs for future donation.&quot;

In nature, this process forces a species to improve or die. In ours, the weak, decrepit, stupid,&amp;lazy are not only uneaten, but are fed by my tax dollars. Even disease, famine&amp;natural disasters are largely thwarted by modern means, removing the last possible effort of our planet to weed out the unworthy. Humans are doomed.&quot;

&quot;People who have convinced themselves that they are entitled to respect yet do not have to respect others. This is especially poigant in traffic. People in this city dress themselves up in their fancy cars, visit all the popular places (which is any new place that pops up since this city is so small), hang out with all the popular people, and all the time they behave in traffic and in their daily lives as if they somehow do not have to use their turn signals, drive the speed limit, or use the passing lane for what it&apos;s intended. Bug off. Your all&apos;s bird feeder stinks like the rest of us, so get off your high horse. You still live in Lexington, no matter how prestigious your address. You&apos;re not that far from up the food chain.&quot;

&quot;It really ticks me off that this &quot;city&quot; doesn&apos;t welcome growth. The road system has been mentioned several times, and rightfully so. Our government officials shoot down a 15 story complex to be located across from Rupp Arena that would provide hotel space, a workout facility, and public parking. The reason you ask...It was too tall. They agreed to allow the same company to build this complex if it was lowered to 7 stories. What the Hell!? Either way it was going to take up the same space. What difference does it make if it&apos;s 100 stories? We seem to discourage growth and expansion of this &quot;city&quot; for reasons I don&apos;t understand. The government claims they don&apos;t want to destroy their precious horse and farm land. If that really is the case, then what the hell do you call the Hamburg area? They need to start doing whats right for the area. Growth is a happening thing. Ignoring it will be horrible.&quot;

&quot;New Circle Road was originally a &quot;Bypass&quot;, just like all of the other bypasses in the smaller communities surrounding Lexington. So, on the north side of town, where all of the stop lights are, that was originally Lexington&apos;s &quot;bypass&quot;. It later became New Circle Road, and the amount of lights should have been considered at that time. But, there was a lot less people and traffic in this town at that time. It seems that our city lacked then what it lacks now - a vision, or any idea of what our future needs may be. We need help from people who know what they&apos;re doing, because our leaders haven&apos;t known for the last 50 years (look at Nicholasville Road). We need a fresh vision in Lexington. Get out and vote for the people who you think will make a difference.&quot;

 JN, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;My main complaint (surprise, surprise!) is with the road system. New Circle Road is - unfortunately - the main &quot;freeway&quot; Lexington has to buzzing around the city. But...it TICKS ME OFF that once you get around the Richmond area you slam into traffic lights! It&apos;s like a clogged artery (the only semi-artery) for Lexington. I don&apos;t know WHY they did such a decent job everywhere else but allowed for all the stop lights from Woodland to Northpark. It&apos;s ridiculous! They should - at VERY least - take out the lights and work out some sort of ramp system like they did for all the other roads. And the proposed New Town Pike system? Um...riiiiight. Turning it into a landscaped blvd is going to do nothing for the traffic. What do they think this is, a one horse town? They&apos;ve made sure of it it isn&apos;t (especially as of late). I&apos;m gravely concerned with the outcome of continuing to neglect the road system. Something HAS TO BE DONE immediately b/c in case someone&apos;s blind out there...we&apos;re in trouble!&quot;

&quot;JB for mayor!!! Yeah, good thinking, JB. Welcome the stockyards right next to your state&apos;s largest (or one of the largest at least) tourist attractions??? Come on!!! Sure, the stockyards needs to be out of downtown in order to grow, and they need a good location, but it also needs to fit in with the surrounding properties (i.e. industrial center type oroperties). The horse park is a gem and is locally under-appreciated. People from all over the world visit and enjoy the place, and they will tell you that there is no other place like it in the world (yes, the entire world). The stockyards cant keep their current site clean and up to date, so what would it look like in 10-15 years??? Our city leaders were being very short-sighted, and trying to push the deal through, even after it had been rejected by the board of adjustment, and it actually took a call from the Governor to make someone pay attention??? The &quot;World Equestrian Games&quot; (not the international horse games) has never been in the U.S. That tells you how impressed they were with the facilities at the horse park. The issue is not that the horse park thinks it&apos;s crap doesn&apos;t stink, but at least they clean it up!!! I say JB for mayor!!! We need another &quot;good ol&apos; boy&quot; running things in Lexington.&quot;

&quot;Un Friendly Lexington. I have been here in Lexington for an year and a half now,this town is the most unfriendly town that I have either lived in or visited&quot;&quot;&quot;

 WR, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I agree with the highway problems. Lexington keeps growing. People keep moving in. Stores keep going up, but no new roads to accommodate the growth. Simple errands in Lexington become 4 hour journeys because of traffic. I love Lexington, but I lose my religion driving in this town.&quot;

 TC, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;The fact that the International Horse Games are coming and there&apos;s not one plan to widen New Circle Road or Man O War. I also don&apos;t like the landscape Lexington has become with farms becoming subdivisions with cookie cutter homes. The developers sure love that money in developing shopping centers and subdivisions, but yet no one has considered about the number of people are on the roads. Also, getting back with the Horse Park, it is a shame that they think their crap don&apos;t stink and didn&apos;t want to welcome the Stockyards as neighbors to support the local agriculture in central Kentucky.&quot;

&quot;I agree with others who are frustrated with too much media coverage regarding John Michael Montgomery&apos;s DUI arrest. It&apos;s sensationialism journalism.

&quot;The media is all over the coverage of John Michael Montgomery&apos;s arrest. He&apos;s human, made a mistake, leave it alone. It certainly doesn&apos;t warrant hours of news time spent on it. He does quite a bit for our community, nice way to repay him. The media should spend time researching how many reckless driving arrest are made where the driver passes the dui test, but the police officers still arrest them for reckless driving. The media should make a difference in our community, cover issues that are important to the majority of people, not to become an &quot;EXTRA EXTRA&quot; broadcast.&quot;

&quot;The stop lights on Manowar, and ultimately,everywhere in this town. I had to be somewhere at a certain time the other day. I wasn&apos;t speeding, i was just going faster than most,,and passed them up. I come to the stop light on manwar in front of the underground fire station. I stop, (which is fine). and wait.. I end up waiting for at least 8 to 10 minutes for the green light. The last 5 minutes there was NO activity in the intersection. Absolutely none.... was i waiting on a flock of ducks to cross? I then notice the cars I passed up, way back on nicholasville rd intersection, caught up and pulled in behind me. The light turns green. What is with these lights!!!! No wonder we have so many traffic problems in this town! The city needs to re adjust the sensors or timers, or whatever they got under the pavement, because they are off. You can&apos;t get anywhere in this town in a reasonable time.&quot;

 BJ, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;Dratistically overpaid Doctors, Nurses and other healthcare providers.

&quot;Unrealistic&amp;Unknowledgeable UK Basketball &quot;Fans&quot;:

1. Tubby Smith has zero obligation to listen to or consider the opinions of UK Fans. He ONLY has an obligation to the University, his players and their parents.

2. UK cannot have the ultimate season every, single year. Making the Sweet 16 should be 100% satisfying to any college basketball fan in today&apos;s environment. Just ask Duke.

3. The thought by media and fans that our team is not as talented as others this year is ludicrous. We have 3-5 future NBA players on the team RIGHT NOW. The problem is that they are all sophomores (except Moss who will get free agent try outs)- they obviously have talent, but need to develop leadership and consistency.

4. Good teams have losing streaks - ask the Detroit Pistons.

5. Local media, specifically Herald-Leader Columnists, TV Folks and radio commentators are showing their lack of knowledge and professionalism by jumping on the negative band wagon directed toward UK Basketball. (Side Note: no local media personality other than Kris Kross should EVER comment on NBA Basketball - they obviously have no experience or wherewithall when it comes to hardcore basketball.)

6. There was a team that had worse seasons than we are having right now 2-4 years ago. They had talent, but it had not yet matured. Guess who? The defending national champs - UNC.

7. The only thing anyone will remember about this season is what happens in the post season (just like every other year) - let&apos;s see what happens.

Okay - class is over. Get a grip on yourselves people.&quot;

&quot;When people throw absurd statistics out there like R from Versailles K regarding the Hispanic population. What is your source.&quot;

 gg, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;ya know what is the worst? its the the thought that this country does not want to believe that the hispanic population is making up 1/2 of our census. and if the government passes the law to send all the hispanics back to mexico, then this country will be at dire straits! Do you know that nearly 1/2 of the american women in this country is involved with a hispanic man? and if our leaders decide to ship them back so to speak, then there will be thousands of women and children seeking government assistance!!!!!!!!!! everyone for this move should sit down and think this issue over and wonder what would this country&apos;s finances be like once this happend.&quot;

&quot;Right on LW in whitley city. Animal abuse needs to stop!!!!! The punishment for someone who has abused and/or murdered an animal should be the same punishment that person would get if they abused and/or killed a person. Animals are living, breathing, feeling creatures just like you and me. They should be protected and cared for because they do not have the means to speak up for themselves. All animals are gifts from God and they should be treated that way. I seriously doubt that God blessed us with pets and companions so we can neglect, abuse and murder them.&quot;

&quot;To all you Bush Bashers out there.. Just imagine how safe we would all be if we had elected Strong Man and Inventor of the Internet, Al Gore. This President, I truly believe, is doing what he knows in his heart are the right, but politically unpopular things to do. I admire the courage of his convictions, and thumbing his nose at the Washington Insiders and Beltway Boys. Also, the mainstream media takes every shot they have to make him look bad. TRUST ME, you are NOT getting both sides of every story. We are in tough and dangerous times with enemies who have technologies to do great harm to our health, and economies. Keeping this nation safe, secure, and running takes more than any of us can imagine. &quot;Dubya&quot; may not be the most articulate, charming, or charismatic President we have ever had. Those are superficial qualities. His policies are tough medicine we need. Wake up and smell the coffee.&quot;

&quot;To KA: Ego has nothing to do with it. Sure, people need to be mindful of other drivers and work together instead of against one another. But there are also a lot of people out there who don&apos;t need to be driving. Period. Those people are making the roadways unsafe for all of us. I, like the other driver mentioned, avoid NC whenever I can, but every time I do have to get onto NC, I see someone violating traffic rules and putting other people in danger (usually within just a couple of minutes)! Yes, there are idiots out there. And that has nothing to do with ego.&quot;

&quot;On the traffic issue. Read all that is said here and the true issue will be revealed! Most of the drivers out there think that everyone else is an idiot! How can anything in life flow smoothly when that is the attitude. Follow the rules, if you don&apos;t fully understand the rules seek that understanding. Learn to cooperate and maintain focus.

&quot;If every driver did three things then our morning commute would be much more peaceful. 1) keep distance between your car and the car in front of you 2) use your blinker to communicate with other drivers and last but not least... 3) work with, not against, other drivers to ensure that every driver has a safe and comfortable passage to their destination&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t care if you merge, yield or stop. Just get out of my way!&quot;

&quot;About three years ago I made the decision to avoid NC road at all cost. I have to say my blood presure has been so much better since that day. I was listening to Kruser on talk radio and I think he hit the nail on the head. That driver that&apos;s already on NC road approaching speeds of near 70 mph has his or her own agenda and more often than not it goes like this ME ME ME it&apos;s all about ME. Thus the chances of them being concerned about you getting on NC road from that ramp in a safe and timely manner are slim and none. While I&apos;m here I may as well bust open another hornets nest. What&apos;s up with TAILGATING driver&apos;s. I just don&apos;t understand why a driver would take a chance on buying the driver of that vehicle in front of them a new rear end just for an extra 15 to 20 feet of asphalt real estate. Here&apos;s a concept, that commute that you made 2 years ago in 20 minute&apos;s is now going to take 25. Simply because there a more drivers and vehicle&apos;s now. Just leave the house 5 minutes earlier. It&apos;s a no brainer. I know the young new drivers are getting attention for their driving habits. Are we not training and testing well enough? I admit it&apos;s been some years since I took my driving test in downtown Lex however I recall the State Police testing officer had me all over downtown and the test was nearly 45 minutes in length. I have a child that turned 16 just a few years ago and their testing was barely out of the parking garage and back in 15 minutes. Can you really do a sufficient test in that amount of time? I know I spent several hours in teaching and training my child to be the best dirver they could be. I hope parents of soon to be new driver&apos;s are doing the same. It&apos;s ugly out there. NASCAR has a great concept where they place a big yellow stripe on the rear bumper of a rookie driver. This sounds like a good idea for new public street drivers. It would let the more experienced drivers know their status and drive their vehicle a little more cautiously when around them. Just a thought. In closing let&apos;s face it Lexington your really not going to get anywhere in a hurry in this town. I suggest give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination, your heart and possibly your insurance company will appreciate it. Try to be courteous behind the wheel. OK, I feel better getting that off my chest so I&apos;ll yield or merge from the soap box so that others can say I&apos;m a stupid idiot and such.&quot;

&quot;Hey, FF Help me out here... I&apos;m just another idiot occupying space in your world... What do you call someone who always thinks they&apos;re right, even when they&apos;re wrong?&quot;

&quot;George Carlin said it best. Anyone who drives faster that you is an idiot. Anyone who drives slower than you is a moron.&quot;

&quot;No wonder we in central KY pay some of the highest auto insurance rates in America with geniuses like DS and CG behind the wheel. People like you are the reason there&apos;s people like Darryl Isaacs. Thank God we have MA as a certified driving instructor to save the day. Oh...wait. Nevermind. Thanks sooooooooo much for your brilliant insight, geek (you said it). Maybe you should check the manual yourself...page 31 to be exact. (http://www.kentuckystatepolice.org/pdf/section3.pdf) GC, think about this for a little &quot;whilt.&quot; When calling someone an idiot, it&apos;s best not to be one yourself. People, my point is if cars entering New Circle (or I-75) literally had to YIELD to cars already on NC there would be YIELD signs at the end of all entry ramps instead of an Acceleration Lane. Nobody would ever get anywhere! DS, you said &quot;people coming onto NC are to yield, yes, he said yield, to traffic.&quot; Now if you&apos;re talking about those with special needs like GC who enter at a 45-degree angle and cut off 2 lanes in the process while blabbering on their cell, then yes, I&apos;m with you. But if you&apos;re saying you don&apos;t have to slow down or change lanes for merging traffic simply b/c you have the &quot;right-of-way&quot;, well then, I hope you learn the hard way. It&apos;s so hard being right all the time. Damn, I rule.&quot;

&quot;To: ds So, ds what are you doing to help these poor children? I agree, when are the parents going to take responsibility?&quot;

 cg, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;How much energy does it take to say thanks, excuse me, use your turn signal, and flush?&quot;

 GC, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;TO: ds Good points you making. The great thing is we live in a country that allows us all to make our comments. You know what? Just maybe the traffic discussion about ramps and exiting onto New Circle might just help somebody from getting hurt. I saw a close call just this week. People exiting off Nicholasville Rd. onto New Circle. Maybe the technically correct answer is that the drivers on NC have the right of way, but the true right way would be for the drivers on NC to get in the left lane and make it easier and safer for those trying to get onto NC. You are right. Kids need our help. When are the parents going to take some responsibility? Govt handouts aren&apos;t the answer. Buckle up.&quot;

&quot;I can&apos;t believe the audacity of some people with their remarks. Children are starving, freezing, and doing without while you argue over whether Tubby is doing a good job and who has right of way to NC. Some of these children need care from abuse and/or drug related problems. Let the little things go and start looking out for the people around you and how you can help.&quot;

 ds, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;To FF: Sorry to tell you this, but you are soooooooo wrong! I am certain because I am a state certified driving instructor (geek). Check the driver&apos;s manual - it&apos;s available on-line if you need it. Page 14 says: &quot;A yield sign is shaped like a triangle and may be red and white or yellow and black. It means you should slow down and yield to traffic on the road you are entering or crossing&quot;. That&apos;s word for word from the manual. Look it up if you like.&quot;

 ma, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;Hey, FF Thought about that for a little whilt, and I&apos;ve concluded that you are really an idiot! So many people are driving who couldn&apos;t even pass a driver&apos;s test. Sure, people on new circle should get over (if they can) to let someone in. But if you&apos;re coming off a ramp, you are to stop, if necessary, until you can get in!!!&quot;

 gc, lex, ky   |   



 


&quot;Hey FF, Go back and take your test again! People already on the road have the RIGHT OF WAY!!!&quot;

 ds, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;Another thing that ticks me off is Tubby Smith and our basketball situation. It is like we are watching our football team, but on a hard court. Kentucky is about basketball and something needs to be done to get back to what Kentucky used to be known for. It hasn&apos;t been that way since Tubby came to town. The credit for his first championship should go to Rick, since it was his team and not the Tubster&apos;s.&quot;

 CG, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;When did a four way stop change to a &quot;I&apos;ll just slow down or pause and then go? Some people don&apos;t even pause. I am talking about the four way stop at Greendale and Mercer Roads. What will it take to get traffic to flow the way it should at this intersection. I get pissed off just coming to the intersection because I know what will happen.&quot;

 CG, Lexington, Ky   |   



 


&quot;Tubby Smith&apos;s pitiful performance as head coach and the way the media acts like he&apos;s the second coming of John Wooden. Our basketball program is in an 8 year downward spiral and can only be salvaged by replacing the (entire) coaching staff.&quot;

&quot;I think it&apos;s a shame that the UK Hoops team (Lady Cats) are having a great season and get little recognition in our hometown newspaper. They went to Florida last night and soundly beat a top 25 team and they are not the main headline in the Sports section. Shame on the Herald-Leader.&quot;

 SG, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;Hey DS, are you for real? You must belong to the multitude of pathetic drivers who don&apos;t know the difference between a yield and a merge! Let me break it down for you. You know those red/white triangular signs that say YIELD? Well oddly enough those mean you do NOT have the right of way. Conversely, the diamond-shaped yellow signs that show two lanes merging together mean either slow the hell down or change lanes for merging traffic. Coincidentally, I think you&apos;ll find a merge sign adjacent to just about every entry ramp on N.C. You must be one of those morons who not only stops at the end of the entry ramp and backs up traffic half a mile, but also speeds up whenever I&apos;m trying to merge. Guess I&apos;ll just cruise down the emergency lane until someone lets me in. Idiots.&quot;

&quot;People like MM in Georgetown who spout off at the mouth without realizing it&apos;s their party who has been keeping the &quot;working man&quot; down by handing them cradle-to-grave entitlements. This in and of itself leads our nation toward quasi-socialism. Liberal thinking has turned out country into a mess and now that the republicans are in power they fear for their lives. Fear that the 10% who favor socialism will be rooted out of the country and rightly so. MM in Georgetown I would gladly debate you anytime anywhere. I will refute any point you make and make you realize the idiocy of your comments. email me at helixx44@yahoo.com and we&apos;ll have us an intelligent debate!&quot;

&quot;The fact that there are no bars in this town. How many college towns do you know of that does not have a block of bars, the bars in this town can&apos;t stay open long enough to succeed (unless you are Austin City or Two Keys). I wish downtown would become a &quot;Downtown&quot; the new developement 500&apos;s on Main is the greatest addition to d-town. Now maybe the bars and shops will get better&quot;

&quot;The Herald Leader- Not only are they the most liberal organization ever, but until now they haven&apos;t had any competition. They misprint information ALL the time, DO not cover MAIN events around town (non profit- the biggest concert in Central KY. Red, White, and Boom)- I can&apos;t tell you how many people I know wish there was another option. Hopefully whoever buys them will clean house and start over.&quot;

&quot;TO RJ in G-TOWN, In W W 2, When Imperial Japan attacked the United States @ Pearl Harbor, FDR didn&apos;t retalliate by invading Indonesia. We haven&apos;t taken the fight to them. Osama Bin Laden is in hiding somewhere, Iraq was and is for all intinsive purposes a WAG THE DOG situation. Take the focus off Afganistan and place it on Iraq. Let&apos;s have CIA be allowed to rape your wife, daughter, son , mother, etc. to gain info if the government thinks you are a terrorist. Lets allow the CIA to kidnap US Citizens off the streets here and send to GITMO for interrogation if we hear that they are a terrorist. Lets search homes, businesses, open mail, tap phones, search your medical records, bank accounts, library records. Talk about freedom. Where are becoming a more Marxist country everyday with the continual errrosion of our civil liberties. The republicans have gotten too powerful! They control the Senate, The House , the White House are making designs to make the Supreme Court a more conservative bunch. Where are the checks&amp;balances that is the forefront of this country. After 228 years are we going to roll over and play dead? Smoking is banned in all public places, Hustler Hollywood being told they can&apos;t build next to the interstate, whats next banning organized religion? WAKE UP BEFORE IT&apos;S TOO LATE!!!!!!! LETS VOTE THE REPUBLICANS OUT @ THE NEXT ELECTION AND SAVE WHAT&apos;S LEFT OF OUR DEMOCRACY B4 WE WAKE UP AND FIND WE LIVE IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Teresa Isaac basically ticks me off every minute of every day. Miss A+. Does she really think she&apos;ll get re-elected?!&quot;

&quot;The bluegrass stockyards and our wonderful city leaders are making every effort to bring the stockyards next to the horse park (one of the state&apos;s larges tourits attractions - for now). This is the absolute worst idea in a long history of bad ideas by our city leaders. Re-elect no one!!!&quot;

 ds, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;For those of you who do not know, people already on New Circle Road have the right-of-way. People coming onto New Circle Road are to yield, yes, I said yield, to traffic.&quot;

 ds, lexington, ky   |   



 


&quot;People in Kentucky Politics/Government who have nothing but big egos and their own agendas to fulfill. If everyone would just work together, we wouldn&apos;t be the laughing joke in this nation when it comes to education, poverty, and salaries.&quot;

 PP, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;I agree about the Lexington drivers part. Some of you people need to get your heads out of your a--es and wake up when you&apos;re driving. Put the cell phone down unless it&apos;s an emergency call and watch the road! Also, stop running red lights before you kill someone!&quot;

 MB, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;these ad saying indinia is getting 60 million dollars from kentuckians a year because they have gambling and we dont. where did they get that number--did they follow kentuckians into a casino and ask them how much they lost?? give me a break. if we do put casinos in ky. dont do it at a race track, thats sacred ground, build one somewhere else besides the track. st richmond.&quot;

&quot;Tobacco Companies who enticed young people to pick up the habit. Smoking has inflicted more misery, financial burdens, raised all of our health care costs, and has been nothing but a dying business. For my kids sake, I want to thank the city leaders who voted in the smoking ban. It is really appreciated when one visits anothe city, goes into a restaurant and realizes that smoking is allowed. Keep the ban!&quot;

&quot;We have too many city leaders who seem to place four legged creatures ahead of two legged ones. We will be in deep doo-doo if the slide in interest in horse racing and gambling on horse races continues as it has during the last decade. We need a back-up plan for a new signature industry.&quot;

 JM, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;The fact that our Vice-Mayor and his gang forced a smoking ban with out a public vote when it was learned that Applebees would be smoke free nation-wide. He wanted to eliminate this disadvantage in the market place, and he did.&quot;

 WH, Lexington, Kentucky   |   



 


&quot;RJ, if you feel safer now than before we invaded a country that had NOTHING to do with 9/11, then you must&apos;ve been asleep for the last couple of years. Either that or a blind believer of every word out Bush&apos;s lying mouth. I&apos;ll grant you no attacks since 9/11, but not the thousands upon thousands of terrorist recruits that invading Iraq has produced. WMD? Hearts and minds? Not a chance.&quot;

&quot;Lexington Drivers who don&apos;t have the courtesy to let someone off the exit ramp by getting over in the left lane around New Circle. I have seen many very close calls because of someone trying to get onto New Circle road and playing Dodge Ball with oncoming Traffic. Get off your cell phones and pay attention!&quot;

 KB, Lexington, KY   |   



 


&quot;To answer HB in Versailles, I am POSITIVE that we haven&apos;t had a major terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. I am positive we are safer now than we were before we took the fight to them.&quot;

 RJ, Georgetown, KY   |   



 


&quot;Yes, because war is indeed positive.&quot;
