 T he objective of this study guide is to prepare you for the Network+ certification exam
 by familiarizing you with the technology or body of knowledge tested on the exam.
 Because the primary focus of the book is to help you pass the test, we don’t always
 cover every aspect of the related technology. Some aspects of the technology are only covered to
 the extent necessary to help you understand what you need to know to pass the exam, but we
 hope this book will serve you as a valuable professional resource after your exam.



In this book
 This book is organized in such a way as to serve as an in-depth review for the
 Network+ certification exam for both experienced network professionals and
 newcomers to the world of network technologies. Each chapter covers a major
 aspect of the exam, with an emphasis on the “why” as well as the “how to” of
 working with and supporting networking environments.


on the CD
 For more information on the CD-ROM, please see the Appendix, “About the CD,”
 at the back of the book.


exam readiness Checklist
 At the end of the Introduction you will find an Exam Readiness Checklist. This table
 has been constructed to allow you to cross-reference the official exam objectives
 with the objectives as they are presented and covered in this book. The checklist
 also allows you to gauge your level of expertise on each objective at the outset of
 your studies. This should allow you to check your progress and make sure you spend
 the time you need on more difficult or unfamiliar sections. References have been
 provided for the objective exactly as the vendor presents it, the section of the study
 guide that covers that objective, and a chapter and page reference.


 xix xx Network+ Certification Study Guide




In every Chapter
 We’ve created a set of chapter components that call your attention to important
 items, reinforce important points, and provide helpful exam-taking hints. Take a
 look at what you’ll find in every chapter:

 n Every chapter begins with Certification Objectives—what you need to know
 in order to pass the section on the exam dealing with the chapter topic.
 The Objective headings identify the objectives within the chapter, so you’ll
 always know an objective when you see it!
 n Exam Watch notes call attention to information about, and potential pitfalls
 in, the exam. These helpful hints are written by authors who have taken the
 exams and received their certification—who better to tell you what to worry
 about? They know what you’re about to go through!
 n Step-by-Step Exercises are interspersed throughout the chapters and
 included on the CD-ROM in LabBook.pdf. These are designed as hands-on
CertCam 1–1 exercises that give you a feel for the real-world experience you need to pass
 the exam. They help you master skills that are likely to be an area of focus
 on the exam. Don’t just read through the exercises; learning by doing is an
ON THE CD
 effective way to increase your competence.
 n On the Job notes describe the issues that come up most often in real-world
 settings. They provide a valuable perspective on certification- and product-
 related topics. They point out common mistakes, and address questions that
 have arisen from on-the-job discussions and experience.
 n Inside the Exam sidebars highlight some of the most common and confusing
 problems that students encounter when taking a live exam. Designed to
 anticipate what the exam will emphasize, they help ensure you know what you
 need to know to pass the exam. You can get a leg up on how to respond to those
 difficult-to-understand questions by paying extra attention to these sidebars.
 n The Certification Summary is a succinct review of the chapter and a
 restatement of salient points regarding the exam.
 n The Two-Minute Drill at the end of every chapter is a checklist of the main
 3 points of the chapter. It can be used for last-minute review.
 Q&amp;A n The Self Test offers questions similar to those found on the certification
 exams. The answers to these questions, as well as explanations of the
 answers, can be found at the end of each chapter. By taking the Self Test
 after completing each chapter, you’ll reinforce what you’ve learned from that
 chapter, while becoming familiar with the structure of the exam questions. Preface xxi


some Pointers
 Once you’ve finished reading this book, set aside some time to do a thorough review.
 You might want to return to the book several times and make use of all the methods
 it offers for reviewing the material:

 1. Re-read all the Two-Minute Drills, or have someone quiz you. You can also
 use the drills as a way to do a quick cram before the exam. You might want
 to make some flash cards out of 3 × 5 index cards that have the Two-Minute
 Drill material on them.
 2. Re-read all the Exam Watch notes and Inside the Exam elements. Remember
 that these notes are written by authors who have taken the exam and
 passed. They know what you should expect—and what you should be on
 the lookout for.
 3. Re-take the Self Tests. Taking the tests right after you’ve read the chapter is
 a good idea, because the questions help reinforce what you’ve just learned.
 However, it’s an even better idea to go back later and do all the questions in
 the book in one sitting. Pretend that you’re taking the live exam. When you
 go through the questions the first time, you should mark your answers on a
 separate piece of paper. That way, you can run through the questions as many
 times as you need to until you feel comfortable with the material.
 4. Complete the Exercises. Did you do the exercises when you read through each
 chapter? If not, do them! These exercises are designed to cover exam topics,
 and there’s no better way to get to know this material than by practicing. Be
 sure you understand why you are performing each step in each exercise. If
 there is something you are not clear on, re-read that section in the chapter. IntroDuCtIon




 I f you are new to certifications, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news
 is that a computer industry certification is one of the most valuable credentials you can earn.
 It sets you apart from the crowd and marks you as a valuable asset to your employer. You will
 gain the respect of your peers, and certification can have a wonderful effect on your income.

 The bad news is that certification tests are not easy. You may think you will read
 through some study material, memorize a few facts, and pass the examinations. After
 all, these certification exams are just computer-based, multiple-choice tests, so they
 must be easy. If you believe this, you are wrong. Unlike many “multiple-guess” tests
 you have been exposed to in school, the questions on certification examinations go
 beyond simple factual knowledge.
 The purpose of this introduction is to teach you how to take a computer
 certification examination. To be successful, you need to know something about the
 purpose and structure of these tests. We will also look at the latest innovations in
 computerized testing. Using simulations and adaptive testing, the computer industry
 is enhancing both the validity and security of the certification process. These factors
 have some important effects on how you should prepare for an exam, as well as your
 approach to each question during the test.
 We will begin by looking at the purpose, focus, and structure of certification tests,
 and we will examine the effect these factors have on the kinds of questions you
 will face on your certification exams. We will define the structure of examination
 questions and investigate some common formats. Next, we will present a strategy for
 answering these questions. Finally, we will give some specific guidelines on what you
 should do on the day of your test.


the Value of Certification
 The CompTIA Network+ certification program, like the certification programs
 from Microsoft, Lotus, Novell, Oracle, and other software vendors, is maintained for
 the ultimate purpose of increasing the corporation’s profits through the creation of
 skilled workers. A successful certification program accomplishes this goal by helping Introduction xxiii


 to create a pool of certification questions that not only test the knowledge of the
 candidate but also test that candidate’s skills.
 Vendor certification has become increasingly popular over the years because it helps
 employers find qualified workers, and it helps software vendors such as Microsoft sell
 products. Many employers are looking for professionals who hold IT certifications, and
 a number of individuals without the required certification are overlooked.
 A marked characteristic of the computer certification program is an emphasis on
 performing specific job tasks rather than merely gathering knowledge. It may come
 as a shock, but most potential employers do not care how much you know about the
 theory of operating systems, networking, or database design. As one IT manager put
 it, “I don’t really care what my employees know about the theory of our network.
 We don’t need someone to sit at a desk and think about it. We need people who can
 actually do something to make it work better.”
 CompTIA’s Network+ certification program will test you on current network
 implementations in wide use today, including network-related hardware and software.
 The job task orientation of certification is almost as obvious, but testing real-world job
 skills using a computer-based test is not easy. In Network+, CompTIA have created a
 great certification exam that ensures a candidate knows the basics of networking.


test structure and specifications
 The 2009 version of the Network+ Certification exam is exam number N10-004 and
 is titled the CompTIA Network+ (2009 Edition) Exam. You can book your exam
 online at www.2test.com. The Network+ exam cost is approximately $240 U.S., but
 the price may be different in your country. The exam is approximately 85 questions,
 and you have 90 minutes to complete the exam.
 The topics that you are tested on are divided into domains. The following table lists
 the different domains and what percentage of the questions are based on each domain.

 Domain % of examination
 1.0 Network Technologies 20%
 2.0 Network Media and Topologies 20%
 3.0 Network Devices 17%
 4.0 Network Management 20%
 5.0 Network Tools 12%
 6.0 Network Security 11%
 Total 100% xxiv Network+ Certification Study Guide



 The Network+ exam is known as a form test, and this is the type of test that
 we are most familiar with. A form test is made up of a number of multiple-choice
 questions, and you can go back to previous questions at any point. For the CompTIA
 certification, a form consists of 85 questions and allows for 90 minutes to complete.
 The CompTIA Network+ exam is a form-based test where each correct answer
 gives you the same amount of points. The score is on a scale from 100 to 900,
 and a score of 554 must be obtained in order to pass. An interesting and useful
 characteristic of a form test is that you can mark a question you have doubts about as
 you take the test. Assuming you have time left when you finish all the questions, you
 can return and spend more time on the questions you have marked as doubtful.
 CompTIA, like Microsoft, may soon implement adaptive testing for the Network+
 exam. To develop this interactive technique, a form test is first created and
 administered to several thousand certification candidates. The statistics generated
 are used to assign a weight, or difficulty level, for each question. For example, the
 questions in a form might be divided into levels one through five, with level-one
 questions being the easiest and level-five the hardest.
 When an adaptive test begins, the candidate is first given a level-three question.
 If he answers it correctly, he is given a question from the next higher level; if he
 answers it incorrectly, he is given a question from the next lower level. When 15–20
 questions have been answered in this manner, the scoring algorithm is able to
 predict, with a high degree of statistical certainty, whether the candidate would pass
 or fail if all the questions in the form were answered. When the required degree of
 certainty is attained, the test ends and the candidate receives a pass/fail grade.
 Adaptive testing has some definite advantages for everyone involved in the
 certification process. Adaptive tests enable the test center to deliver more tests
 with the same resources, because certification candidates often are in and out in
 30 minutes or less. For CompTIA, adaptive testing means that fewer test questions
 are exposed to each candidate, which enhances the security, and therefore the
 validity, of certification tests.
 One possible problem you may have with adaptive testing is that you are not
 allowed to mark and revisit questions. Because the adaptive algorithm is interactive,
 and all questions but the first are selected on the basis of your response to the
 previous question, it is not possible to skip a particular question or change an answer.


Question types
 Computerized test questions can be presented in a number of ways. Some of the
 possible formats for questions are listed here, and you may find any of the following
 types of questions on your Network+ certification exam. Introduction xxv


true/False
We are all familiar with True/False questions, but because of the inherent 50 percent
chance of choosing the correct answer, you will most likely not see true/false
questions on your Network+ certification exam.

Multiple Choice
The majority of Network+ certification questions are in the multiple-choice format,
with either a single correct answer or multiple correct answers that need to be
selected. One interesting variation on multiple-choice questions with multiple
correct answers is whether or not the candidate is told how many answers are
correct—you might be told to select all that apply.

Graphical Questions
One or more graphical elements are sometimes used as exhibits to help present or
clarify an exam question. These elements may take the form of a network diagram
or pictures of networking components on which you are being tested. It is often
easier to present the concepts required for a complex performance-based scenario
with a graphic than it is with words. Expect to see some graphical questions on your
Network+ exam.
 Test questions known as hotspots actually incorporate graphics as part of the
answer. These questions ask the certification candidate to click a location or
graphical element to answer the question. As an example, you might be shown the
diagram of a network and asked to click an appropriate location for a router. The
answer is correct if the candidate clicks within the hotspot that defines the correct
location. The Network+ exam has a few of these graphical hotspot questions, and
most are asking you to identify network types, such as a bus or star network. As with
the graphical questions, expect only a couple of hotspot questions during your exam.

Free response Questions
Another kind of question you sometimes see on certification examinations requires
a free response or type-in answer. This type of question might present a TCP/IP
network scenario and ask the candidate to calculate and enter the correct subnet
mask in dotted decimal notation. However, the CompTIA Network+ exam most
likely will not contain any free response questions. xxvi Network+ Certification Study Guide




Knowledge-based and Performance-based Questions
 CompTIA Certification develops a blueprint for each certification examination
 with input from subject matter experts. This blueprint defines the content areas and
 objectives for each test, and each test question is created to test a specific objective.
 The basic information from the examination blueprint can be found on CompTIA’s
 Web site at http://certification.comptia.org/network/default.aspx.
 Psychometricians (psychologists who specialize in designing and analyzing tests)
 categorize test questions as knowledge-based or performance-based. As the names
 imply, knowledge-based questions are designed to test knowledge, and performance-
 based questions are designed to test performance.
 Some objectives demand a knowledge-based question. For example, objectives
 that use verbs such as list and identify tend to test only what you know, not what
 you can do. For example:
 Objective: Explain the following Transport Layer concepts.
 Knowledge-based question: Which two protocols are connectionless-oriented network
 protocols? (Choose two.)
 A. FTP
 B. TCP
 C. TFTP
 D. UDP
 C and D are correct.
 The Network+ exam consists of mostly knowledge-based multiple-choice
 questions that can be answered fairly quickly if you know your stuff. These questions
 are very straightforward, lacking a complex situation to confuse you.
 Other objectives use action verbs such as install, configure, and troubleshoot
 to define job tasks. These objectives can often be tested with either a knowledge-
 based question or a performance-based question. CompTIA are focusing their exam
 questions to performance-based questions where you will need to know how to
 perform a task instead of just the theory behind it. For example:
 Performance-based question: You want to ensure you have a reliable tape backup
 scheme that is not susceptible to fire and water hazards. You are backing up three
 Windows servers and would like to completely back up the entire systems. Which of
 the following is the most reliable backup method? Introduction xxvii


 A. Configure the backup program to back up the user files and operating system
 files; complete a test restore of the backup; and store the backup tapes offsite in a
 fireproof vault.
 B. Configure the backup program to back up the entire hard drive of each server
 and store the backup tapes offsite in a fireproof vault.
 C. Copy the user files to another server; configure the backup program to back up
 the operating system files; and store the backup tapes offsite in a fireproof vault.
 D. Configure the backup program to back up the user files and operating system files
 and store the backup tapes offsite in fireproof vault.
 A is correct.
 Even in this simple example, the superiority of the performance-based question
 is obvious. Whereas the knowledge-based question asks for a single fact, the
 performance-based question presents a real-life situation and requires that you make
 a decision based on this scenario. Thus, performance-based questions give more bang
 (validity) for the test author’s buck (individual question).


testing Job Performance
 We have said that CompTIA certification focuses on timeliness and the ability
 to perform job tasks. We have also introduced the concept of performance-based
 questions, but even performance-based multiple-choice questions do not really
 measure performance. Another strategy is needed to test job skills.
 Given unlimited resources, it is not difficult to test job skills. In an ideal
 world, CompTIA would fly Network+ candidates to a test facility; place them in
 a controlled environment with a team of experts; and ask them to plan, install,
 maintain, and troubleshoot a network. In a few days at most, the experts could
 reach a valid decision as to whether each candidate should or should not be granted
 Network+ status. Needless to say, this is not likely to happen.
 Closer to reality, another way to test performance is to use the actual software
 and create a testing program to present tasks and automatically grade a candidate’s
 performance when the tasks are completed. This cooperative approach would be
 practical in some testing situations, but the same test that is presented to Network+
 candidates in Boston must also be available in Bahrain and Botswana. Many testing
 locations around the world cannot run 32-bit applications, much less provide the
 complex networked solutions required by cooperative testing applications.
 The most workable solution for measuring performance in today’s testing
 environment is a simulation program. When the program is launched during a test, the xxviii Network+ Certification Study Guide



 candidate sees a simulation of the actual software that looks and behaves just like the
 real thing. When the testing software presents a task, the simulation program is launched
 and the candidate performs the required task. The testing software then grades the
 candidate’s performance on the required task and moves to the next question.
 Simulation questions provide many advantages over other testing methodologies,
 and simulations are expected to become increasingly important in the computer
 certification programs. For example, studies have shown that there is a very high
 correlation between the ability to perform simulated tasks on a computer-based
 test and the ability to perform the actual job tasks. Thus, simulations enhance the
 validity of the certification process.
 Another truly wonderful benefit of simulations is in the area of test security.
 It is just not possible to cheat on a simulation question. In fact, you will be told
 exactly what tasks you are expected to perform on the test. How can a certification
 candidate cheat? By learning to perform the tasks? What a concept!


study strategies
 There are a number of different ways to study for the different types of questions
 you will see on a CompTIA Network+ certification examination. The following
 section outlines some of the methods you can use to prepare for the different types of
 questions.

 Knowledge-based Questions
 Knowledge-based questions require that you memorize facts. There are hundreds of
 facts inherent in every content area of every Network+ certification examination.
 There are several tricks to memorizing facts:

 n Repetition The more times your brain is exposed to a fact, the more likely
 you are to remember it. Flash cards are a wonderful tool for repetition. Either
 make your own flash cards on paper or download a flash card program and
 develop your own questions.
 n Association Connecting facts within a logical framework makes them
 easier to remember. Try using mnemonics, such as “All People Seem To Need
 Data Processing” to remember the seven layers of the OSI model in order.
 n Motor Association It is often easier to remember something if you write
 it down or perform some other physical act, such as clicking a practice test
 answer. You will find that hands-on experience with the product or concept
 being tested is a great way to develop motor association. Introduction xxix


 We have said that the emphasis of CompTIA certification is job performance,
and that there are very few knowledge-based questions on CompTIA certification
exams. Why should you waste a lot of time learning filenames, IP address formulas,
and other minutiae? Read on.

Performance-based Questions
Most of the questions you will face on a CompTIA certification exam are
performance-based scenario questions. We have discussed the superiority of these
questions over simple knowledge-based questions, but you should remember that
the job task orientation of CompTIA certification extends the knowledge you
need to pass the exams; it does not replace this knowledge. Therefore, the first step
in preparing for scenario questions is to absorb as many facts relating to the exam
content areas as you can. In other words, go back to the previous section and follow
the steps to prepare for an exam composed of knowledge-based questions.
 The second step is to familiarize yourself with the format of the questions you are
likely to see on the exam. You can do this by answering the questions in this study
guide, or by using practice tests. The day of your test is not the time to be surprised
by the complicated construction of some exam questions.
 For example, one of CompTIA Certification’s favorite formats of late takes the
following form found on Microsoft exams:
Scenario: You have a network with…
Primary Objective: You want to…
Secondary Objective: You also want to…
Proposed Solution: Do this…
What does the proposed solution accomplish?
A. It achieves the primary and the secondary objective.
B. It achieves the primary but not the secondary objective.
C. It achieves the secondary but not the primary objective.
D. It achieves neither the primary nor the secondary objective.
 This kind of question, with some variation, is seen on many Microsoft Certification
examinations and may be present on your Network+ certification exam.
 At best, these performance-based scenario questions really do test certification
candidates at a higher cognitive level than knowledge-based questions do. At worst,
these questions can test your reading comprehension and test-taking ability rather xxx Network+ Certification Study Guide



 than your ability to administer networks. Be sure to get in the habit of reading the
 question carefully to determine what is being asked.
 The third step in preparing for CompTIA scenario questions is to adopt the
 following attitude: Multiple-choice questions aren’t really performance-based. It is
 all a cruel lie. These scenario questions are just knowledge-based questions with a
 little story wrapped around them.
 To answer a scenario question, you have to sift through the story to the
 underlying facts of the situation and apply your knowledge to determine the correct
 answer. This may sound silly at first, but the process we go through in solving real-
 life problems is quite similar. The key concept is that every scenario question (and
 every real-life problem) has a fact at its center, and if we can identify that fact, we
 can answer the question.

 of the low cost of networking devices such as hubs and home routers. As a Network+
 Certified Professional, you will need to ensure that you can support these small,
 medium, and large networks, so you will start by learning some basic terms.
 A network is a group of systems that are connected to allow sharing of resources—
 such as files or printers—or sharing of services—such as an Internet connection.
 There are two aspects of setting up a network: the hardware used to connect the
 systems together and the software installed on the computers to allow them to
 communicate. This chapter is designed to give you an understanding of the hardware
 used to build a network, and later chapters discuss the software needed. The network
 hardware is made up of two basic components: the entities that want to share the
 information or resources, such as servers and workstations, and the medium that
 enables the entities to communicate, which is a cable or a wireless medium.


servers, Workstations, and Hosts
 A typical network involves having users sit at workstations, running such
 applications as word processors or spreadsheet programs. The workstation also is Identifying Characteristics of a Network 3


 known as a client, which is just a basic computer running a client operating system
 such as Windows XP or Linux. These users typically store their files on a central
 server so that they can share the files with other users on the network. The server
 is a special computer that contains more disk space and memory than are found
 on client workstations. The server has special software installed that allows it to
 function as a server. This special software can provide file and print services (to
 allow sharing of files and printers), provide web pages to clients, or provide e-mail
 functionality to the company.
 The term host refers to any computer or device that is connected to a network
 and sends or receives information on that network. A host can be a server, a
 workstation, a printer with its own network card, or a device such as a router. We
 can summarize by saying that any system or device that is connected to the network
 is known as a host.


Wans, Lans, and Mans
 Some other terms that you will hear often are LAN, WAN, and MAN. A local area
 network (LAN) typically is confined to a single building, such as an office building,
 your home network, or a college campus. A wide area network (WAN) spans multiple
 geographic locations and is typically made up of multiple LANs. For example, I
 have a company with an office in Halifax, Nova Scotia (that’s a city in Canada next
 door to the penguins) that has 100 computers all connected together. This would be
 considered a LAN. Now if we expand the company and create an office in Toronto,
 the network in Toronto also would be considered a LAN. If we want to allow the
 two offices to share information with one another, we would connect the two LANs
 together, creating a WAN.
 The term metropolitan area network (MAN) is not used often anymore; it
 refers to a network that exists within a single city or metropolitan area. If we had
 two different buildings within a city that were connected together, it would be
 considered a MAN.


types of networks
 Organizations of different sizes, structures, and budgets need different types of
 networks. A local newspaper company has needs for its network that would be
 different from the needs of a multinational company. Networks can be divided
 into one of two categories: peer-to-peer or server-based networks. 4 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 Peer-to-Peer network
 A peer-to-peer network has no dedicated servers; instead, a number of workstations
 are connected together for the purpose of sharing information or devices. When
 there is no dedicated server, all workstations are considered equal; any one of them
 can participate as the client or the server. Peer-to-peer networks are designed
 to satisfy the networking needs of home networks or of small companies that do
 not want to spend a lot of money on a dedicated server but still want to have the
 capability to share information or devices. For example, a small accounting firm with
 three employees that needs to access customer data from any of the three systems
 or print to one printer from any of the three systems may not want to spend a lot of
 money on a dedicated server. A small peer-to-peer network will allow these three
 computers to share the printer and the customer information with one another (see
 Figure 1-1). The extra cost of a server was not incurred because the existing client
 systems were networked together to create the peer-to-peer network.

 The Microsoft term for a peer-to-peer network is a workgroup. Be aware that
 peer-to-peer networks typically consist of fewer than 10 systems.

 Most of the modern operating systems such as Windows XP and Windows Vista
 already have built-in peer-to-peer networking capabilities, which is why building a
 peer-to-peer network would be a “cheap” network solution. The disadvantage of a
 peer-to-peer network is the lack of centralized administration—with peer-to-peer
 networks, you need to build user accounts and configure security on each system.

 Workstation B Workstation C Identifying Characteristics of a Network 5


 It is important to note that peer-to-peer networks are designed for fewer than
 10 systems, and with Microsoft client operating systems such as Windows XP
 Professional, only 10 concurrent network connections to those clients are allowed.
 This means that if you have 15 or 20 employees, you eventually will need to
 implement a server-based network.

 server-based networks
 A big disadvantage of peer-to-peer networking is that you can’t do your day-to-
 day administration in a single place. With peer-to-peer networking, user accounts
 typically are created on all the systems, and data files are stored throughout all the
 systems. This leads to a more complicated environment and makes your job harder
 as a network administrator. Usually after four or five systems have been networked,
 the need for a dedicated server to store all of the user accounts and data files
 becomes apparent—this is a server-based network (see Figure 1-2).
 The advantage of a server-based network is that the data files that will be used
 by all of the users are stored on the one server. This will help you by giving you a
 central point to set up permissions on the data files, and it will give you a central
 point from which to back up all of the data in case data loss should occur. With a
 server-based network, the network server stores a list of users who may use network
 resources and usually holds the resources as well.

 The server in a server-based network may provide a number of different services.
 The services it will offer to the network usually are decided by the server’s role.
 There are a number of different roles that a server could play on a network:

 n File and print servers
 n Application servers
 n Web servers
 n Directory servers

 File and print servers control and share printers and files among clients on the
 network. File and print servers were the original reason to have a network; a large
 number of users needed access to the same files, so the files were placed on a server,
 and all clients were connected to the server when they needed to work with the
 files. File servers often have the following characteristics:

 n Large amounts of memory
 n Fast hard disks
 n Multiple CPUs
 n Fast I/O buses
 n High-capacity tape drives
 n Fast network adapters
 n Redundant power supplies
 n Hot-swappable hard disks and power supplies

 File and print servers also check the access control list (ACL) of each resource
 before allowing a user to access a file or use a printer. If the user or a group to which
 the user belongs is not listed in the ACL, the user is not allowed to use the resource,
 and an “access denied” message appears on the user’s screen.
 Application servers are servers that run some form of special program on the server.
 A good example of an application server is a server that runs the company’s e-mail
 server. The e-mail server software is special software that can be run on a server
 operating system. Another example of software that would run on an application
 server is a database server product such as Microsoft SQL Server. A database server Identifying Characteristics of a Network 7


is a server that holds the company’s core business data and typically gives this data to
custom applications that run on the workstations. These are some applications that
you might find on an application server:

 n Microsoft SQL Server
 n Oracle
 n Microsoft Exchange Server
 n IBM Lotus Domino

 Web servers are servers that run the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
are designed to publish information on the Internet or the corporate intranet. Web
servers are popular in today’s businesses because they host web applications (web
sites) for the organization. These web applications could be designed for internal use,
or they could be used to publish information to the rest of the world on the Internet.
Examples of web server software are Microsoft’s Internet Information Services that
runs on Windows or Apache web server software that runs on UNIX/Linux, Novell
NetWare, and Windows.
 Directory servers hold a list of the user accounts that are allowed to log on to the
network. This list of user accounts is stored in a database (known as the directory
database) and can store information about these user accounts such as address,
city, phone number, and fax number. A directory service is designed to be a central
database that can be used to store everything about such objects as users and
printers.
 In a server-based network environment, the centralized administration comes
from the fact that the directory server stores all user accounts in its directory
database. When a user sits at a client machine to log on to the network, the logon
request is sent to this directory server. If the username and password exist in the
directory database, the client is allowed to access network resources.
 It is important to note that a server can have numerous roles at the same time.
A server can be a file and print server, as well as an application server, or it can be
a file, print, and directory server all at the same time. Because a single server can
perform multiple roles, a company will not need to purchase an additional server
every time a new product (or feature) is implemented on the network, and this fact
reduces the cost of a server-based network. 8 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts




internet, intranet, and extranet
 Internet, intranet, and extranet are three terms that describe “Internet-type”
 applications that are used by an organization, but how do you know if a web
 application is part of your intranet or part of the Internet?

 n Internet If you wish to expose information to everyone in the world, then
 you would build an Internet-type application. An Internet-type application
 uses Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, or SMTP and is available to
 persons anywhere on the Internet. We use the Internet and web applications
 as ways to extend who the application can reach. For example, I no longer
 need to go to the bank to transfer funds. Because the bank has built a web site
 on the Internet, I can do that from the comfort of my own home.
 n Intranet An application is considered to be on the company’s intranet if it
 is using Internet-type protocols such as HTTP or FTP but the application is
 available only within the company. The information on a company’s intranet
 would not be accessible to persons on the Internet because it is not for public
 use. For example, a few years ago I was sitting with my banking officer going
 over my account and noticed that the bank had moved all of its customer
 account information to a web site and that the banking officer was using a
 web browser to retrieve my account details. Although the application was
 being used by a web browser, it was still an “internal” application meant only
 for banking officers.
 n Extranet From time to time, an application that has been built for the
 company’s intranet and used by internal employees will need to be extended
 to select business partners or customers. If you extend your intranet out
 to select business partners or customers, you have created an extranet. An
 extranet cannot be used by anyone else external to the company except for
 those selected individuals. Figure 1-3 displays the basic configurations of
 Internet, intranet, and extranet.

 This section has introduced you to some terms such as peer-to-peer versus
 server-based networking, Internet, intranet, and extranet; now let’s look at how the
 network is laid out with the different network topologies! Identifying Network Topologies 9

identifying network topologies
 This section will introduce you to a number of different network topologies, but
 this topic is a lead-in to a bigger topic introduced later in the chapter: network
 architecture. A network architecture is made up of a topology, a cable type, and an
 access method. Before we can discuss network architectures, we need to specify what
 the different types of topologies, cables, and access methods are. 10 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 A network topology is the physical layout of computers, cables, and other
 components on a network. There are a number of different network topologies, and
 a network may be built using multiple topologies. The different types of network
 layouts are

 n Bus topology
 n Star topology
 n Mesh topology
 n Ring topology
 n Hybrid topology
 n Wireless topology


bus topologies
 A bus topology uses one cable as a main trunk to connect all of the systems together
 (shown in Figure 1-4). A bus topology is very easy to set up and requires no additional
 hardware such as a hub. The cable is also called a trunk, a backbone, or a segment.
 With a bus topology, when a computer sends out a signal, the signal travels the
 cable length in both directions from the sending computer. When the signal reaches
 the end of the cable length, it bounces back and returns in the direction it came
 from. This is known as signal bounce. Signal bounce is a problem, because if another
 signal is sent on the cable length at the same time, the two signals will collide and
 be destroyed and then must be retransmitted. For this reason, at each end of the
 cable there is a terminator. The terminator is designed to absorb the signal when
 the signal reaches the end, preventing signal bounce. If there is no termination, the
 entire network fails because of signal bounce, which also means that if there is ever
 a break in the cable, you will have unterminated ends and the entire network will go
 down, as shown in Figure 1-5.

 A bus is a passive topology, which means that

 for regenerating the signal as it passes by them.

 there is an unterminated end in the bus, the
 entire network will fail.

 advantages of a bus topology
 One advantage of a bus topology is cost. A bus topology uses less cable than a star
 topology or a mesh topology, and you do not need to purchase any additional devices
 such as hubs. Another advantage of a bus topology is the ease of installation. With a
 bus topology, you simply connect the workstation to the cable segment or backbone.
 You need only the amount of cable to connect the workstation to the backbone.
 The most economical choice for a network topology is a bus topology, because it is
 easy to work with and a minimal amount of additional devices are required. Most
 importantly, if a computer fails, the network stays functional.

 Disadvantages of a bus topology
 The main disadvantage of a bus topology is the difficulty of troubleshooting it.
 When the network goes down, it is usually due to a break in the cable segment.
 With a large network, this problem can be tough to isolate. 12 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 Scalability is an important consideration in the dynamic world of networking.
 Being able to make changes easily within the size and layout of your network can be
 important in future productivity or downtime. The bus topology is not very scalable.


star topologies
 In a star topology, all computers are connected through one central device known
 as a hub or a switch, as illustrated in Figure 1-6. Each workstation has a cable that
 goes from the network card to the hub device. One of the major benefits of a star
 topology is that a break in the cable causes only the workstation that is connected to
 the cable to go down, not the entire network, as with a bus topology. Star topologies
 are very popular topologies in today’s networking environments.

 advantages of a star topology
 One advantage of a star topology is scalability and ease of adding another system
 to the network. If you need to add another workstation to the network with a star
 topology, you simply connect that system to an unused port on the hub. Another
 benefit is the fact that if there is a break in the cable it affects only the system that is
 connected to that cable. Figure 1-7 shows a hub
 with a few ports available.
 Centralizing network components can make
 an administrator’s life much easier in the long

 connections come to a central point.

 figure 1-7

 Disadvantages of a star topology
 On the flip side, if the hub fails in a star topology, the entire network comes down,
 so we still have a central point of failure. But this is a much easier problem to
 troubleshoot than trying to find a cable break with a bus topology.
 Another disadvantage of a star topology is cost. To connect each workstation
 to the network, you will need to ensure that there is a hub with an available port,
 and you will need to ensure you have a cable to go from the workstation to the hub.
 Today, the cost is increasingly less of a disadvantage because of the low prices of
 devices such as hubs and switches.


Mesh topologies
 A mesh topology is not very common in computer networking today, but you must
 understand the concept for the exam. In a mesh topology, every workstation has a
 connection to every other component of the network, as illustrated in Figure 1-8.


 figure 1-8

Computers in a
mesh topology
are all connected
to every other
computer on the
network. 14 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 advantages of a Mesh topology
 The biggest advantage of a mesh topology is fault tolerance, meaning that, if there
 is a break in a cable segment, traffic can be rerouted through a different pathway
 because there are multiple pathways to send data from one system to another. This
 fault tolerance means that it is almost impossible for the network to go down due to
 a cable fault.

 Disadvantages of a Mesh topology
 A disadvantage of a mesh topology is the cost of the additional cabling and network
 interfaces to create the multiple pathways between each system. A mesh topology is
 very hard to administer and manage because of the numerous connections.


ring topologies
 In a ring topology, all computers are connected via a cable that loops in a ring or
 circle. As shown in Figure 1-9, a ring topology is a circle that has no start and no
 end. Because there are no ends, terminators are not necessary in a ring topology.
 Signals travel in one direction on a ring while they are passed from one computer
 to the next, with each computer regenerating the signal so that it may travel the
 distance required.


 figure 1-9

A ring topology Identifying Network Topologies 15


 advantages of a ring topology
 A major advantage of a ring topology is that signal degeneration is low because each
 workstation is responsible for regenerating or boosting the signal. With the other
 topologies, as the signal travels the wire, it gets weaker and weaker as a result of outside
 interference: eventually, it becomes unreadable if the destination system is too far
 away. Because each workstation in a ring topology regenerates the signal, the signal is
 stronger when it reaches its destination and seldom needs to be retransmitted.

 Disadvantages of a ring topology
 The biggest problem with ring topologies is that if one computer fails or the cable link
 is broken, the entire network could go down. With newer technology, however, this
 isn’t always the case. The concept of a ring topology today is that the ring will not be
 broken when a system is disconnected; only that system is dropped from the ring.
 Isolating a problem can be difficult in some ring configurations. (With newer
 technologies, a workstation or server will put out a beacon if it notices a break in the
 ring.) Another disadvantage is that if you make a cabling change to the network or
 move a workstation, the brief disconnection can interrupt or bring down the entire
 network.


Hybrid topologies
 It is important to note that it is typical for networks to implement a mixture of
 topologies to form a hybrid topology. For example, a very popular hybrid topology is
 a star-bus topology, in which a number of star topologies are connected by a central
 bus, as shown in Figure 1-10. This is a popular topology because the bus will connect
 hubs that are spread over distance.
 Another very popular hybrid topology is the star-ring topology. The star-ring
 topology is popular because it looks like a star but acts as a ring. For example, there
 is a network architecture known as Token Ring (more on this later, in the section
 “Network Architectures”) that uses a central “hub” type device, but the internal
 wiring makes a ring. Physically it looks like a star, but logically it acts as a ring
 topology.


Wireless topologies
 A wireless topology is one in which few cables are used to connect systems.
 The network is made up of transmitters that broadcast the packets using radio 16 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts

 frequencies. The network contains special transmitters called cells, or wireless access
 points, which extend a radio sphere in the shape of a bubble around the transmitter.
 This bubble can extend to multiple rooms and possibly floors in a building. The
 PCs and network devices have a special transmitter-receiver, which allows them
 to receive broadcasts and transmit requested data back to the access point. The
 access point is connected to the physical network by a cable, which allows it, and
 any wireless clients, to communicate with systems on the wired network. A wireless
 network topology is shown in Figure 1-11.
 Notice in Figure 1-11 that the wireless cells, or access points, are connected to
 the network by connecting into the hub or switch that has a connection to the rest
 of the wired network. Also notice that the clients do not have cables connecting
 them to the network. These are wireless clients, and they will get access to the
 network through the wireless cell (or access point).
 Another option for wireless networks is the use of a radio antenna on or near the
 building, which allows one cell to cover the building and the surrounding area. This
 approach is best in a campus-type arrangement, where many buildings that need to
 be included in the cell are in a close geographical area. This setup does not easily Identifying Network Topologies 17

 allow you to connect the buildings by a backbone and physical cables and then to
 each building containing the required cells for all its PCs and devices.
 Wireless networks also can consist of infrared communications, similar to a
 remote-control TV, but this type of communication is slow and requires a direct
 line of sight—as well as close proximity—for the communication to work. Infrared
 mainly is used only between two systems. Infrared is not used often as a complete
 networking solution and should not be considered even as an option for a whole
 network; it is useful between laptops or a laptop and a printer.

 advantages of a Wireless topology
 The nice thing about wireless networks is the lack of cabling. The wireless network
 requires only base backbone segments to connect the wireless cells to the wired
 network if there is one. Once these are set up, the PC and network devices also need 18 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 the special transmitter-receiver network interface cards to allow the PCs and devices
 to communicate with the cell and then through the cell to the servers.
 Troubleshooting failed devices and cells is very easy and makes failed components
 easy to find and replace.

 Disadvantages of a Wireless topology
 Disadvantages of wireless networks include a greater chance of signal interference,
 blockage, and interception. Other devices and machinery that emit radio frequencies
 or “noise” can cause interference and static, which can disrupt the bubble of communi-
 cation around the cell. Another source of noise is lightning during storms. This noise is
 the same static you hear when lightning strikes while you are speaking on a phone.
 Blockage can occur in structures that are made of thick stone or metal, which
 do not allow radio frequencies to pass through easily. This drawback usually can
 be overcome somewhat by changing the frequency used by the devices to a higher
 frequency. You can determine early if this is going to be a problem in your building
 by trying to use a radio inside the building to pick up some radio stations. If the radio
 will not pick them up, the building material is too thick to allow radio frequencies
 to pass through the walls. This problem can be overcome by installing a cell in each
 room where a PC or network device will be placed.
 Another major disadvantage with wireless is
 signal interception. Signal interception means
 unwanted third parties could intercept wireless
 communications without physically being on the

 in transit. You will learn about wireless security in
 Chapter 7.


Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint
 There are two popular layouts for topologies: they are either point-to-point or point-
 to-multipoint. A point-to-point topology—also known as host to host—is one system
 connected directly to another system. In the past these systems would connect
 directly through the serial ports with a null modem cable, but these days, you could
 connect them using a crossover cable or a wireless connection. Identifying Network Topologies 19


 A point-to-multipoint topology uses a central device that connects all the devices
 together. This topology is popular with wireless. With point-to-multipoint, when
 the central device sends data, it is received by all devices connected to the central
 device. But if one of the devices that are connected sends data, then it is received by
 only the destination system.


segments and backbones
 With the various topologies you’ve looked at, you have seen the words segment and
 backbone mentioned a couple of times. A network segment is a cable length (or
 multiple cable lengths) that is uninterrupted by network connectivity devices, such
 as bridges and routers. It is typical that a single network may be broken into multiple
 network segments through the use of a bridge or router to cut down on network
 traffic, as shown in Figure 1-12.
 In Figure 1-12, notice that there are three network segments named Segment A,
 Segment B, and Segment C. Also notice that each network segment could have a
 number of clients and servers all connected through a number of hubs that are then
 connected to a backbone. This is just one possible solution involving network segments.

 You also saw the word backbone mentioned a few times. A backbone is the main
 cable segment or trunk in the network. In a bus network, you might see a main cable
 trunk that has smaller cables connecting the workstations. These smaller cables,
 known as drop cables, connect the workstations to the backbone. Figure 1-13 shows
 a backbone with drop cables.
 Another example of a backbone is a satellite linking geographically dispersed
 local area networks (LANs), making a wide area network (WAN). Such a backbone
 is an example of a wireless communications network, whereas the previous examples
 all used cable as the medium.

network Media and Connectors
 Now that you have learned that networks are built using a topology of bus, star,
 or ring, let’s take a look at how the systems will be connected in the topology that
 you choose. Cabling is the medium for the transmission of data between hosts on
 the LANs. LANs can be connected together using a variety of cable types, such as
 unshielded twisted-pair, coax, or fiber. Each cable type has its own advantages and
 disadvantages, which you will examine in this section.
 There are three primary types of cable media that can be used to connect systems
 to a network—coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, and fiber-optic cable. Transmission Network Media and Connectors 21


 rates that can be supported on each of these physical media are measured in millions
 of bits per second, or megabits per second (Mbps).


Coaxial Cable
 Coaxial, or coax, cable looks like the cable used to bring the cable TV signal to your
 television. One strand (a solid-core copper wire) runs down the middle of the cable.
 Around that strand is a layer of insulation, and covering that insulation is braided
 wire and metal foil, which shields against electromagnetic interference. A final layer
 of insulation covers the braided wire. Because of the layers of insulation, coaxial
 cable is more resistant to outside interference than other cabling, such as unshielded
 twisted-pair (UTP) cable. Figure 1-14 shows
 a coaxial cable with the copper core and the
 layers of insulation.
 There are two types of coax cabling: thinnet
 Both thinnet and thicknet and thicknet. The two differ in thickness and
 have a transfer rate of 10 Mbps. maximum cable distance that the signal can
 travel. Let’s take a look at thinnet and thicknet:

 n Thinnet This refers to RG-58 cabling, which is a flexible coaxial cable
 about ¼-inch thick. Thinnet is used for short-distance communication
 and is flexible enough to facilitate routing between workstations. Thinnet
 connects directly to a workstation’s network adapter card using a British
 naval connector (BNC) and uses the network adapter card’s internal
 transceiver. The maximum length of thinnet is 185 meters. Figure 1-15
 displays thinnet coaxial cabling and the BNC connector on the end.
 n Thicknet This coaxial cable, also known as RG-8, gets its name by being
 a thicker cable than thinnet. Thicknet cable is about ½-inch thick and can
 support data transfer over longer distances than thinnet. Thicknet has a
 maximum cable length of 500 meters and usually is used as a backbone to
 connect several smaller thinnet-based networks. Due to the thickness of
 ½ inch, this cable is harder to work with than thinnet cable. A transceiver
 often is connected directly to the thicknet cable using a connector known
 as a vampire tap. Connection from the transceiver to the network adapter
 card is made using a drop cable to connect to the adapter unit interface
 (AUI) port connector. Table 1-1 summarizes the characteristics of thicknet
 and thinnet. 22 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts

twisted-Pair Cable
 Coaxial cable is not as popular today as it was a few years ago; today the
 popularity contest has been dominated by twisted-pair cabling. Twisted-pair
 cabling gets its name by having four pairs of
 wires that are twisted to help reduce crosstalk
 or interference from outside electrical devices.
 (Crosstalk is interference from adjacent

(UTP) cable




 unshielded twisted-Pair (utP) Cable
 Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cables are familiar to you if you have worked with
 telephone cable. The typical twisted-pair cable for network use contains four pairs of
 wires. Each member of the pair of wires contained in the cable is twisted around the
 other. The twists in the wires help shield against electromagnetic interference. The
 maximum distance of UTP is 100 meters.
 UTP cable uses small plastic connectors designated as registered jack 45, or most
 often referred to as RJ-45. RJ-45 is similar to the phone connectors, except that
 instead of four wires, as found in the home system, the network RJ-45 connector
 contains eight contacts, one for each wire in a UTP cable. The bottom cable in
 Figure 1-17 is an RJ-45 connector.
 It can be easy to confuse the RJ-45 connector with the RJ-11 connector. The
 RJ-11 connector is a telephone connector and is shown in Figure 1-17 (the cable
 on the top). In an RJ-11 connector, there are four contacts; hence there are four
 wires found in the telephone cable. With RJ-45 and RJ-11, you will need a special
 crimping tool when creating the cables to make contact between the pins in the
 connector and the wires inside the cable.
 UTP cable is easier to install than coaxial because you can pull it around corners
 more easily due to its flexibility and small size. Twisted-pair cable is more susceptible
 to interference than coaxial, however, and should not be used in environments
 containing large electrical or electronic devices. 24 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts

 UTP cabling has different flavors, known
 as grades or categories. Each category of UTP
 cabling was designed for a specific type of
 communication or transfer rate. Table 1-2
 Be sure to know the summarizes the different UTP categories—the
 different categories of UTP cabling for most popular today being CAT 5e, which
 the Network+ exam. can reach transfer rates of over 1000 Mbps or
 1 gigabit per second (Gbps).

 Wiring standards
 It is important to understand the order of the wires within the RJ-45 connector
 for both the Network+ exam and in the real world if you intend on creating (also
 known as crimping) your own cables. Let’s start with some basics of comparing a
 straight-through cable with a crossover cable.

 straight-through Cables CAT 5 UTP cabling usually uses only four wires
 when sending and receiving information on the network. The four wires of the eight
 that are used are wires 1, 2, 3, and 6. Figure 1-18 shows the meaning of the pins on a
 computer and the pins on a hub (or switch), which is what you typically will be con-
 necting the computers to. When you configure the wire for the same pin at either
 end of the cable, this is known as a straight-through cable. Network Media and Connectors 25

 Category 4 Data 16 Mbps
 Category 5 Data 100 Mbps
 Category 5e Data 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps)
 Category 6 Data 10 Gbps



 You will notice in the figure that wires 1 and 2 are used to transmit data (TX)
 from the computer, while wires 3 and 6 are used to receive information (RX) on the
 computer. You will also notice that the transmit pin on the computer is connected
 to the receive pin (RX) on the hub via wires 1 and 2. This is important because
 we want to make sure that data that is sent from the computer is received at the
 network hub. We also want to make sure that data sent from the hub is received
 at the computer, so you will notice that the transmit pins (TX) on the hub are
 connected to the receive pins (RX) on the computer through wires 3 and 6. This
 will allow the computer to receive information from the hub.
 The last thing to note about Figure 1-18 is that pin 1 on the computer is
 connected to pin 1 on the hub by the same wire, thus the term straight-through. You
 will notice that all pins are matched straight through to the other side in Figure 1-18.

 Crossover Cables At some point, you may need to connect two computer
 systems directly together without the use of a hub, from network card to network
 card. To do this, you would not be able to use a straight-through cable because the
 transmit pin on one computer would be connected to the transmit pin on another

 computer, as shown in Figure 1-19. How could a computer pick up the data if it was
 not sent to the receive pins? This will not work, so we will need to change the wir-
 ing of the cable to what is known as a crossover cable.
 In order to connect two systems directly together without the use of a hub, you
 will need to create a crossover cable by switching wires 1 and 2 with wires 3 and 6 at
 one end of the cable, as shown in Figure 1-20.
 You will notice that the transmit pins on
 Computer A are connected to the receive pins
 For the Network+ exam, on Computer B, thus allowing Computer A to
 remember that to create a crossover send data to Computer B. The same applies for
 cable wires 1 and 2 are switched with Computer B to send to Computer A—pins A
 wires 3 and 6 on one end of the cable. and B on Computer B are wired to pins 3 and 6
 on Computer A so that Computer A can receive
 data from Computer B.

 568a and 568b standards Although only four of the wires are used to send
 and receive data in most environments today, some of the newer standards use all
 eight wires. Therefore, it is important to know the order of all eight wires in a UTP
 cable. There are two popular wiring standards today, 568A and 568B, but because
 568B is the more popular standard for CAT 5 and CAT 5e, I will discuss the wire
 order for 568B. Table 1-3 shows the wire order for the 568B standard of a straight-
 through cable at both ends.

 Following this standard and what you have learned of crossover cables, you would

 switching the wires on one end, you would have a cable that has the order of wires
 shown in Table 1-4.

A crimping tool




 Before moving on to other cable types, apply what you have learned by crimping
 (creating) your own CAT 5 cable. To create your own network cable, you will
 need to have a crimper like the one shown in Figure 1-21. You can get a fairly
 cheap crimping tool at your local electronics store, but you can also buy some fairly
 expensive crimping tools.
 When you select a crimping tool, you want to make sure that you have one
 that has a built-in crimper as well as a wire stripper and a wire cutter. Exercise 1-1
 demonstrates the steps needed to crimp your own CAT 5 cable.


 exerCise 1-1

Crimping a Category 5 Cable
 In this exercise, you will learn how to crimp your own CAT 5 cable. To complete
 this exercise, you will need to have a crimping tool, a piece of CAT 5 cabling, some
 RJ-45 connectors, and a little bit of patience! To create a CAT 5 cable, do the
 following:

 1. Ensure that you have a clean-cut end on the cable by using your wire cutters
 to cut a little off the end of the CAT 5 cable.
 2. Once you have cut a clean end on the cable, strip about an inch off the outer
 jacket from the cable using the wire-stripper portion of your crimping tool,
 as shown in the next illustration. After stripping the outer jacket off, make
 sure that you have not cut into any of the individual wires. If you have, cut a
 clean end off the cable again and start from the beginning. Network Media and Connectors 29




3. Once you have stripped the outer jacket off the cable, order the wires from
 left to right to follow the 568B standard. This is where your patience will
 come in, because it will take some time to get the wires in the correct order
 and placed tightly together so that they will go inside the RJ-45 connector.
4. Once you have the wires aligned in the correct order and you have them
 all nice and snug together so that they will fit inside the RJ-45 connector,
 you are ready to insert them into the connector. Before inserting the wires
 into the connector, make sure that their ends are of equal length; if they are
 not, just cut the tips a bit with your wire cutters, as shown in the following
 illustration, to be certain that they will fit nicely into the RJ-45 connector. 30 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 5. Slide the wires into the RJ-45 connector, as shown in the next illustration,
 and make sure that all wires have made contact with the metal contacts
 inside the RJ-45 connector by looking at the end of the connector. This is
 where mistakes happen frequently; there is usually one wire in the middle
 that is not pushed up to the end of the connector.




 6. Once you are certain that all wires have made contact, you can “crimp”
 the wire, which will enclose the RJ-45 connector on the wires, creating a
 permanent fit. Insert the connector into the crimping tool and squeeze the
 handle tight, as seen in the following illustration. Network Media and Connectors 31


 rollover A rollover cable is a popular cable type in the networking world and is
 used to connect to a Cisco device such as a router or a switch. Also known as a con-
 sole cable, this cable connects from the computer’s serial port to the console port of
 the router or switch. Once the network administrator connects to the console port,
 he or she is then able to configure the router or switch.


 shielded twisted-Pair (stP) Cable
 Shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable is very similar
 to UTP cabling, but it differs from UTP in that
 it uses a layer of insulation within the protective

 as compared to UTP.


fiber-optic Cable
 The third type of cabling that we want to discuss is fiber-optic cabling. Fiber-optic
 cabling is unlike coax and twisted-pair, because both of those types have a copper
 wire that carries the electrical signal. Fiber-optic cables use optical fibers that carry
 digital data signals in the form of modulated pulses of light. An optical fiber consists
 of an extremely thin cylinder of glass, called the core, surrounded by a concentric
 layer of glass, known as the cladding. There are two fibers per cable—one to


 figure 1-22

 CAT 5e STP 32 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 transmit and one to receive. The core also can be an optical-quality clear plastic,
 and the cladding can be made up of gel that reflects signals back into the fiber to
 reduce signal loss. Figure 1-23 shows fibers in a fiber-optic cable.
 There are two types of fiber-optic cables: single-mode fiber (SMF) and multimode
 fiber (MMF).

 n Single-mode fiber Uses a single ray of light, known as a mode, to carry the
 transmission over long distances.
 n Multimode fiber Uses multiple rays of light (modes) simultaneously,
 with each ray of light running at a different reflection angle to carry the
 transmission over short distances.

 Fiber-optic cable supports up to 1000 stations and can carry the signal up to
 and beyond 2 kilometers. Fiber-optic cables are also highly secure from outside
 interference, such as radio transmitters, arc welders, fluorescent lights, and other
 sources of electrical noise. On the other hand, fiber-optic cable is by far the most
 expensive of these cabling methods, and a small network is unlikely to need these
 features. Depending on local labor rates and building codes, installing fiber-optic
 cable can cost as much as $500 per network node.




 You have learned of two in a wire. Outside electrical noise comes
 electrical phenomena that can disrupt from lights, motors, radio systems, and
 a signal traveling along your network: many other sources. Fiber-optic cables

 Crosstalk is caused by electrical fields in because they do not carry electrical
 adjacent wires, which induce false signals signals—they carry pulses of light.



 Fiber-optic cables can use many types of connectors, but the Network+ exam
 is concerned only with the two major connector types: the straight-tip (ST)
 connector and the subscriber (SC) connector. The ST connector is based on the
 BNC-style connector but has a fiber-optic cable instead of a copper cable. The
 SC connector is square and somewhat similar to an RJ-45 connector. Figure 1-24
 shows the ST (the connector on the left side) and the SC (the connector on the
 right side) connector types. Network Media and Connectors 33

 Regardless of the connector type, the fiber-optic cable still functions at the
 same speed, which is typically 1000 Mbps and faster. The only thing that you
 need to worry about is that the connector matches the device to which it is being
 connected, since the two-connector types are not interchangeable.
 To better understand all of the cable types and when to use some specific types,
 see Exercise 1-2.

 Be sure to take a look at Exercise 1-2 in the LabBook.pdf file that is found on
 ON THE CD the CD-ROM.

 When preparing for the Network+ exam, it is sometimes helpful to have a table
 listing the differences between the different cable types. Table 1-5 summarizes the
 different cable types—be sure to review it for the Network+ exam. 34 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts

Connector types

 Coaxial Connectors
 We have discussed coaxial cabling, and you saw the BNC connector that goes on the
 end of the cable and connects to the network card, but there are a few other BNC
 connector types you should be familiar with. The BNC-T connector is used to connect
 to coax cable from either side (so that the cable length can continue on), while a third
 end of the connector tees out to have a cable length connect to the network card
 on the client machine. Figure 1-25 displays the BNC-T connector being placed on a
 network card. Notice the connector on the card that the T-connector connects to, and
 also notice where the coax cable would continue on through.

 We also discussed the terminator that needs to go at both ends of the coax cable.
 For example, if we use the BNC-T connector to connect our last system to the
 network, we would need to terminate one of the ends on the T-connector, as shown
 in Figure 1-26. Notice that the terminator goes on one end of the T-connector and
 that the coax cable would connect into the other end.

 twisted-Pair Connectors
 We have discussed two major twisted-pair connectors, the RJ-11 for four-wire
 telephone cable and the RJ-45 for eight-wire network cables. There are also barrel
 connectors, which are female connectors on both ends that allow you to join two
 cable lengths together and reach greater distances, not exceeding 100 meters.
 Figure 1-27 shows an RJ-45 barrel connector connecting two cable lengths together.
 There are also BNC barrel connectors.

 other Connectors
 There are a number of additional connector types that you will come across in
 networking environments, some of which are listed here:

 n F-type connector Another connector style for coax cabling, it is the same
 connector style that runs to your TV.
 n Fiber local connector (LC) and mechanical-transfer registered jack
 (MT-RJ) Additional fiber-optic connector types that are similar to the
 registered jack and fiber SC shape. The Fiber LC is the preferred connector
 of the two for communications exceeding 1 Gbps due to its small form
 factor.
 n Universal serial bus (USB) A high-speed serial bus that supports
 127 devices in the chain. USB uses a standard connector type that is used by
 most devices, including mice, printers, network cards, digital cameras, and
 flash drives. There are two USB standards: USB 1.1, which has a transfer
 rate of 12 Mbps, and USB 2.0, which has a transfer rate of 480 Mbps. There
 are two standard USB connectors, Type A and Type B. Type A connectors
 connect to the computer, whereas Type B connectors connect to the device.
 Figure 1-28 displays these two connector styles.
 n IEEE 1394 (FireWire) An ultra-high-speed bus that supports 63 devices in
 the chain and is ideal for real-time applications and devices such as for video.
 FireWire has two standards: 1394a, which has a transfer rate of 400 Mbps,
 and 1394b, which has a transfer rate of 800 Mbps.
 n RS-232 The standard for serial connections using the serial port on a
 computer. The serial port was a popular way to achieve a point-to-point
 connection between two hosts or was used for modems. The RS-232 standard
 defines a transfer rate of 20,000 bits per second, but serial devices support
 higher transfer rates.

 Now that you understand some of the different cable types and connectors,
 Exercise 1-3 will demonstrate to you the steps to install a bus network using thinnet
 and BNC connectors.

access Methods
 You now know that a network uses a network topology—which is the layout of the
 network—and you know that some form of media such as cabling connects all hosts
 on the network. We have discussed the three major types of cabling: coax, twisted-
 pair, and fiber-optic cabling.
 This section will identify what are known as access methods. An access method
 determines how a host will place data on the wire—does the host have to wait
 its turn or can it just place the data on the wire whenever it wants? The answer is
 determined by three major access methods: CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, and token
 passing. Let’s look at each of these access methods.


CsMa/CD
 Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is one of the most
 popular access methods in use today. With CSMA/CD, every host has equal access
 to the wire and can place data on the wire when the wire is free from traffic. If a host
 wishes to place data on the wire, it will “sense” the wire and determine whether there
 is a signal already on the wire. If there is, the host will wait to transmit the data; if the
 wire is free, the host will send the data, as shown in Figure 1-29. 38 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts




 figure 1-29
 hmmm, I need to send
A host “sensing” something—is there anything

it is free of traffic




 Workstation A Workstation B Server




 Workstation C Workstation D



 The problem with the process just described is that, if there are two systems on
 the wire that “sense” the wire at the same time to see if the wire is free, they will
 both send data out at the same time if the wire is free. When the two pieces of data
 are sent out on the wire at the same time, they will collide with one another, and
 the data will be destroyed. If the data is destroyed in transit, the data will need to be
 retransmitted. Consequently, after a collision, each host will wait a variable length
 of time before retransmitting the data (they don’t want the data to collide again),
 thereby preventing a collision the second time. When a system determines that the
 data has collided and then retransmits the data, that is known as collision detection.
 To summarize, CSMA/CD provides that
 before a host sends data on the network, it
 will “sense” (CS) the wire to ensure that the
 All Ethernet environments wire is free of traffic. Multiple systems have
 use CSMA/CD as the access method. equal access to the wire (MA), and if there is a
 collision, a host will detect that collision (CD)
 and retransmit the data.


CsMa/Ca
 Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is not as popular as
 CSMA/CD and for good reason. With CSMA/CA, before a host sends data on the
 wire, it will “sense” the wire as well to see if the wire is free of signals. If the wire Network Architectures 39


 is free, it will try to “avoid” a collision by sending a piece of “dummy” data on the
 wire first to see whether it collides with any other data. If it does not collide, the
 host in effect assumes “If my dummy data did not collide, then the real data will not
 collide,” and it submits the real data on the wire.


token Passing
 With both CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA, the possibility of collisions is always there,
 and the more hosts that are placed on the wire, the greater the chances of collisions,
 because you have more systems “waiting”’ for the wire to become free so that they
 can send their data.
 Token passing takes a totally different approach to deciding on how a system can
 place data on the wire. With token passing, there is an empty packet running around
 on the wire—the “token.” In order to place data on the wire, you need to wait for
 the token; once you have the token and it is free of data, you can place your data on
 the wire. Since there is only one token and a host needs to have the token to “talk,”
 it is impossible to have collisions in a token-passing environment.
 For example, if Workstation 1 wants to send data on the wire, the workstation
 would wait for the token, which is circling the network millions of times per second.
 Once the token has reached Workstation 1, the workstation would take the token
 off the network, fill it with data, mark the token as being used so that no other
 systems try to fill the token with data, and then place the token back on the wire
 heading for the destination host.
 All systems will look at the data, but they will not process it, since it is not
 destined for them. However, the system that is the intended destination will read
 the data and send the token back to the sender as a confirmation. Once the token
 has reached the original sender, the token is unflagged as being used and released as
 an empty token onto the network.

network architectures
 This section will discuss the different network architectures that are popular in
 today’s networking environments. This section is very important from an exam point
 of view as well, so be sure to understand how the different architectures are pieced
 together. 40 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 Before we can discuss the different network architectures, we need to start our
 discussions by defining two terms: broadband and baseband transmissions.


broadband and baseband
 There are two different techniques that may be used to transmit the signal along the
 network wire—baseband communication and broadband communication. Let’s take
 a look at each of these techniques.

 n Baseband Sends digital signals through the media as a single channel that
 uses the entire bandwidth of the media. The signal is delivered as a pulse of
 electricity or light, depending on the type of cabling being used. Baseband
 communication is also bidirectional, which means that the same channel can
 be used to send and receive signals.
 n Broadband Sends information in the form of an analog signal, which flows
 as electromagnetic waves or optical waves. Each transmission is assigned
 to a portion of the bandwidth, so unlike with baseband communication,
 it is possible to have multiple transmissions at the same time, with each
 transmission being assigned its own channel or frequency. Broadband
 communication is unidirectional, so in order to send and receive, two
 pathways will need to be used. This can be accomplished either by assigning a
 frequency for sending and assigning a frequency for receiving along the same
 cable or by using two cables, one for sending and one for receiving.


ethernet
 To start us out, I first want to point out that network architecture is something that
 came about one day when someone sat down and said, “We are going to design a
 network architecture; let’s use CAT 3 cabling, a star topology, and CSMA/CD as an
 access method. Oh, and let’s call this architecture 10BaseT!”
 In this example, 10BaseT was the name assigned to the architecture because
 10 Mbps is the transfer rate of the network,
 baseband communication is the technique used
 to transmit the signal, and the T means our cable
 type—in this case twisted-pair. Now, we have
 Ethernet is defined as the discussed different types of twisted-pair cabling,
 IEEE 802.3 standard. but CAT 3 is the one that runs at 10 Mbps, so it
 is the cable used in 10BaseT. Network Architectures 41


 The first types of network architecture to look at are the different Ethernet
 architectures. When designing networks, one of the first decisions we usually make
 is “Do we want to use Ethernet or the competing network architecture called Token
 Ring? Oh, we want to use Ethernet. What flavor of Ethernet?” This section will help
 you understand what the different flavors of Ethernet are.

 10base2
 The 10Base2 Ethernet architecture is a network that runs at 10 Mbps and uses
 baseband transmissions. 10Base2 typically is
 implemented as a bus topology, but it could be
 a mix of a bus and a star topology. The cable
 type that we use is determined by the character
 10Base2 and 10Base5 at the end of the name of the architecture—in
follow what is known as the 5-4-3 rule, this case a 2. The 2 implies 200 meters. Now,
which means that there can be only five what type of cable is limited to approximately
network segments in total, joined by four 200 m? You got it; thinnet is limited to
repeaters (more on repeaters in Chapter approximately 200 m (185 m, to be exact). The
3), but only three of those network only characteristic we have not mentioned is
segments can be populated with nodes. the access method that is used. All Ethernet
 environments use CSMA/CD as a way to put
 data on the wire.
 The following list summarizes features of 10Base2:

 n Baseband communication
 n 10 Mbps transfer rate
 n Maximum distance of 185 meters per network segment
 n 30 hosts per segment
 n 0.5 meters minimum distance between hosts


 10base5
 The 10Base5 Ethernet architecture runs at 10 Mbps and uses baseband transmission
 as well. It was also implemented as a bus topology. The cable it uses is limited to
 approximately 500 meters, which is thicknet, and it uses CSMA/CD as the access
 method. The thicker copper core in the wire allows the signal to travel farther than
 is possible with thinnet. 42 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 The following list summarizes features of 10Base5:

 n Baseband communication
 n 10 Mbps transfer rate
 n Maximum distance of 500 meters per network segment
 n 100 hosts per segment
 n 2.5 meter minimum distance between hosts



 10baset
 The 10BaseT Ethernet architecture runs at 10 Mbps and uses baseband transmission.
 It uses a star topology with a hub or switch at the center, allowing all systems
 to connect to one another. The cable it uses is CAT 3 UTP, which is the UTP
 cable type that runs at 10 Mbps. Keep in mind that most cable types are backward
 compatible, so you could have CAT 5 UTP cabling in a 10BaseT environment. But
 because the network cards and hubs are running at 10 Mbps, that is the maximum
 transfer speed you will get, even though the cable supports more. Like all Ethernet
 environments, 10BaseT uses CSMA/CD as the access method.

 10basefL
 The 10BaseFL Ethernet architecture allows for a 10 Mbps Ethernet environment
 that runs on fiber-optic cabling. The purpose of the fiber-optic cabling is to use it as
 a backbone to allow the network to reach greater distances.

 fast ethernet (100basetx and 100basefx)
 These two standards are part of the 100BaseX family, which is known as fast
 Ethernet. The different fast Ethernet flavors run at 100 Mbps, use a star topology, use
 CSMA/CD as an access method, but differ in the type of cabling used. 100BaseTX
 uses two pairs (four wires) in the CAT 5 cabling, whereas 100BaseFX uses two
 strands of fiber instead of twisted-pair cabling.

 gigabit ethernet
 Gigabit Ethernet is becoming the de facto standard for network architectures today.
 With Gigabit Ethernet we can reach transfer rates of 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps), using
 traditional media such as coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cabling. There are Network Architectures 43


two standards (more on the IEEE standards in Chapter 2) for Gigabit Ethernet: IEEE
802.3z and IEEE 802.3ab.

ieee 802.3z The IEEE 802.3z standard defines Gigabit Ethernet that runs over
fiber-optic cabling or coaxial cabling. There are three types of Gigabit Ethernet that
fall under this standard:

 n 1000BaseSX The Gigabit Ethernet architecture that runs at 1000 Mbps
 over multimode fiber (MMF) optic cabling. This architecture is designed for
 short distances of up to 550 meters.
 n 1000BaseLX The Gigabit Ethernet architecture that runs at 1000 Mbps
 over single-mode fiber (SMF) optic cabling. This architecture supports
 distances up to 3 kilometers.
 n 1000BaseCX The Gigabit Ethernet architecture that runs at 1000 Mbps
 over coaxial cable and supports distances of up to 25 meters.


ieee 802.3ab The IEEE 802.3ab standard, known as 1000BaseTX, defines
Gigabit Ethernet that runs over twisted-pair cabling and uses characteristics of
100BaseTX networking, including the use of RJ-45 connectors and the access
method of CSMA/CD. Like 100BaseTX, 1000BaseTX uses CAT 5e or CAT 6
unshielded twisted-pair; the difference is that 100BaseTX runs over two pairs (four
wires) while 1000BaseTX runs over four pairs (all eight wires).

10-gigabit ethernet
There are standards for 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10,000 Mbps) that have been
developed that use fiber-optic cabling:

 n 10GBaseSR Runs at 10 Gbps and uses “short-range” multimode fiber-optic
 cable, which has a maximum distance of 100 meters.
 n 10GBaseLR Runs at 10 Gbps and uses “long-range” single-mode fiber-optic
 cable, which has a maximum distance of 10 kilometers.
 n 10GBaseER Runs at 10 Gbps and uses “extra-long-range” single-mode
 fiber-optic cable, which has a maximum distance of 40 kilometers.
 n 10GBaseT Runs at 10 Gbps using CAT 6 UTP cabling, which has a
 maximum distance of 100 meters. 44 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 There are special WAN versions of 10-Gigabit Ethernet that use fiber-optic
 cabling to connect to a SONET network (more on SONET in Chapter 9).

 n 10GBaseSW The 10-Gigabit Ethernet standard for short-range, multimode
 fiber-optic cable, which has a maximum distance of 100 meters
 n 10GBaseLW The 10-Gigabit Ethernet standard for long-range, single-
 mode fiber-optic cable, which has a maximum distance of 10 kilometers
 n 10GBaseEW The 10-Gigabit Ethernet standard for extended-range, single-
 mode fiber-optic cable, which has a distance of up to 40 kilometers




 Be familiar with with the speeds, cable types, connectors,

 architectures for the exam. Be familiar architecture.


Token Ring
 A big competitor to Ethernet in the past was Token Ring, which runs at 4 Mbps
 or 16 Mbps. Token Ring is a network architecture that uses a star ring topology
 (a hybrid, looking physically like a star but logically wired as a ring) and can use
 many forms of cables. IBM Token Ring has its own proprietary cable types, while
 more modern implementations of Token Ring can use CAT 3 or CAT 5 UTP
 cabling. Token Ring uses the token-passing access method.
 Looking at Token Ring networks today,
 you may wonder where the “ring” topology
 is, because the network appears to have a star
 topology. The reason this network architecture
 Token Ring is defined as appears to use a star topology is that all hosts
 the IEEE 802.5 standard. are connected to a central device that looks
 similar to a hub, but with Token Ring, this
 device is called a multistation access unit
 (MAU or MSAU). An example is shown in Figure 1-30. The ring is the internal
 communication path within the wiring.
 Token Ring uses token passing; it is impossible to have collisions in a token-
 passing environment, because the MAUs do not have collisions lights as an
 Ethernet hub does (remember that Ethernet uses CSMA/CD and there is potential
 for collisions). Network Architectures 45

 Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) is a network architecture that uses fiber-optic
 cabling, token passing, and a ring topology, but FDDI also uses two counter-rotating
 rings for fault tolerance on the network. For more information on FDDI, please refer
 to Chapter 9.

 Now that you have a general idea of the network topologies, cable types, and
 network architectures, let’s look at the network operating system (NOS). We focus

 Once you have connected the cables to the hubs and the clients to the cables,
 it is time to install a network operating system. The network operating system is
 responsible for providing services to clients on the network. These services could
 be the sharing of files or printers; the server could be providing name resolution
 through DNS services or logon services by being a directory server.
 Let’s take a look at some of the popular network operating systems that provide
 network services to their clients. For this discussion, any time that we mention
 Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, we can also include Windows NT Server,
 because Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003 were built off Windows NT
 technologies and are the successors to Windows NT. 48 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts




Windows servers
 Developed from the VMS platform many years ago, Microsoft Windows NT and its
 successors, Windows Server 2003 and 2008, have grown into very popular network
 operating systems that provide a number of built-in network services, including

 n File and print services These allow the administrator to share files and
 printers among Windows clients.
 n DNS and WINS services These allow the administrator to configure DNS
 and NetBIOS name resolution.
 n DHCP services These allow the administrator to configure the server to
 assign IP addresses to clients on the network.
 n Directory services These allow the administrator to build a central list of
 objects, such as user accounts that may be used by clients to log on to the
 network. Microsoft’s directory service is known as Active Directory.
 n Web services These allow the administrator to build Internet or corporate
 intranet sites that are hosted on the server.
 n E-mail services These allow the administrator to configure the server to
 send e-mail using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). This feature
 was designed to allow application developers to build e-mail functionality
 into their applications.
 n Group policies These allow an administrator to deploy settings down to the
 client operating systems from a central point. Some of the types of settings
 that can be applied to clients through group policies are folder redirection,
 file permissions, user rights, and installation of software.

 We will look at those network services in a later chapter; the point now is that
 the network operating systems usually come with these features and all you need to
 do is install or configure them on the server.
 One of the major factors that led to the popularity of the Windows-based server
 operating systems is that Microsoft developed a user interface on the server that
 was similar to the client operating systems, such as Windows 98, Windows 2000
 Professional, and Windows XP Professional. This dramatically reduces the learning
 curve that someone new to network operating systems has to go through. Figure 1-31
 displays the user interface of a Windows server. Network Operating Systems 49


figure 1-31 The Windows server user interface




 The fact that the user interface on the server operating system is the same as that
 on the client operating system means that the learning curve for the server operating
 system is dramatically reduced. The other thing that led to the rapid growth of the
 installed base for Windows-based servers is the fact that Windows servers made it
 very easy to configure the services that were mentioned previously. For example, to
 install a DNS server, WINS server, or DHCP server, you simply go to Add/Remove
 Programs and install those services as you would install solitaire on a desktop
 operating system.

 Be sure to take a look at Exercise 1-5 in the LabBook.pdf file that is found on
ON THE CD
 the CD-ROM. 50 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 Clients and resources
 A major component of successful networking with NOS is the client operating
 system. The client operating system needs to have client software installed known
 as the redirector. The term redirector comes from the fact that when the client makes
 the request for a network resource, the redirector redirects the request from the
 local system to the network server. Whether the workstations are in a workgroup
 environment (peer-to-peer) or a client/server environment, you need to have client
 software installed on the client operating systems to connect to the servers. Some
 examples of client operating systems that can connect to a Windows server are
 Windows XP Professional, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation
 4.0, Windows 95/98, and Windows for Workgroups.
 Another reason Windows servers have been so successful is that they support
 many different client operating systems. Not only can Windows clients such as
 Windows 98 and Windows XP connect to the Windows servers, but also non-
 Microsoft clients such as Macintosh clients, NetWare clients, and UNIX clients can
 connect to Microsoft servers. Microsoft has been very focused on coexisting with
 other environments.

 Directory services
 With Windows servers, the server that holds the central list of user accounts that
 may log on to the network is called a domain controller. Windows 2000 Server
 and Windows 2003 Server call the database of user accounts that resides on the
 domain controllers the Active Directory Database. Active Directory is Microsoft’s
 implementation of a directory service. Typically when users log on to the network,
 they will sit at a client machine and type a username and password. In the Microsoft
 world, this username and password combination is sent to the domain controller so
 that the domain controller can verify that the logon information is correct. If the
 logon information is correct, the user is allowed to use network resources. A directory
 service also enables users to locate objects on the network such as printers because the
 directory stores more than user accounts—it stores additional network objects such as
 printers and folders so that users can search the directory for these objects.


novell netWare
 It started as a college project for one individual many years ago; today Novell
 NetWare is still used in many large organizations. NetWare has evolved into a
 very powerful network operating system, supporting a number of network services Network Operating Systems 51


 out of the box and an industry-leading directory service. Some of the core services
 supported by a NetWare server include

 n File and print services These allow the administrator to share files and
 printers among NetWare clients.
 n DNS services These allow the administrator to configure a DNS server for
 DNS name resolution.
 n DHCP services These allow the administrator to configure the server to
 assign IP addresses to clients on the network.
 n Directory services These allow the administrator to build a central list of
 objects (such as user accounts) that may be used by clients to log on to the
 network. Novell’s directory service is known as NDS in NetWare 4 and 5, or
 eDirectory in NetWare 6.
 n Web servers These allow the administrator to build Internet or corporate
 intranet sites that are hosted on the server by using Apache web servers
 provided with the NetWare operating system.

 The major difference between Windows servers and NetWare is at the server.
 Until NetWare 5, the server in NetWare was truly a text-based console with many of
 the administrative tasks done at a client workstation. As a NetWare administrator,
 you could manage certain administrative items from the server console, but most
 of the day-to-day administration such as user account management and file system
 administration was done from a workstation. This meant that you had to have a
 workstation with the management tools installed, while with a Windows server you
 have the management tools already installed on the server and can use them at any
 time. Figure 1-32 shows a screenshot of a NetWare 6 server console.


 figure 1-32

A NetWare 6
server console 52 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 Clients and resources
 NetWare supports a wide variety of clients. The main ones, of course, are the
 Windows platform of operating systems, such as Windows 98, Windows 2000 Pro,
 and Windows XP Pro. It should be noted that NetWare now fully supports Linux
 client workstations; as a matter of fact, all previously mentioned Novell services can
 run on Linux server operating systems. Novell client software is required to connect
 to NetWare 4 and NetWare 5 servers but is no longer required for NetWare 6.x,
 because files, printers, e-mail, and administrative tools are all available using a web
 browser. The Network+ exam will assume that the Novell client always is required
 to connect to NetWare servers. The Novell Client software can be downloaded from
 the Novell web site at download.novell.com.

 Although Microsoft operating systems come with a “Client for NetWare
 Networks,” it is recommended to install Novell’s client to connect to
 NetWare 4 and 5 networks to ensure that you are getting the full benefit
 of the networking environment.



 Directory services
 One of the driving features of NetWare since version 4 has been Novell’s directory
 services, known as eDirectory (formerly NDS). eDirectory supports a hierarchical
 grouping of objects that represent resources on the network, as shown in Figure 1-33.
 The objects in the directory tree can be users, printers, volumes, and servers, along
 with others.
 The directory services built into NetWare make administration easier because
 everything is organized and centralized within one utility. Some of the features
 provided by eDirectory include

 n Platform independence eDirectory can run on NetWare servers, Windows
 servers, Linux servers, and UNIX servers.
 n DirXML eDirectory uses DirXML software drivers to synchronize directory
 information with other directories, such as Microsoft Active Directory or
 Oracle’s PeopleSoft.
 n Partitioning and replication eDirectory can be split (partitioned) into
 smaller portions, and these smaller portions (replicas) can be placed on
 strategically selected servers. Network Operating Systems 53

uNiX/Linux
 Originally developed by Bell Labs, UNIX is a very popular operating system for
 powerful networking and database management. UNIX boasts three key features
 that make it powerful: multitasking, multiusers, and networking capabilities.
 UNIX is a very powerful multitasking operating system that can run many
 processes in the background while enabling users to work in the foreground on an
 application. The last feature, networking capability, has been standard for some
 time. UNIX has been the leader in several powerful and diverse utilities that have
 been ported over to other operating systems. UNIX has a very popular cousin,
 known as Linux, which is starting to pick up some market share as both servers
 and clients. Figure 1-34 displays the Linux operating system.

 Clients and resources
 Today’s versions of UNIX and especially Linux are different than the older versions
 of UNIX. Today, like Windows, most Linux versions have a graphical shell loaded
 automatically that allows a user to use the operating system with a mouse. Today’s 54 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



figure 1-34 The Linux user interface




 versions of Linux have programs automatically installed that allow you to configure
 the operating system and change its settings. Like Windows, most Linux operating
 systems have popular programs installed for you to use—programs such as a text
 editor and a calculator. The point is that although most people have traditionally
 associated Linux or UNIX with the command line only, you can do a lot from the
 graphical shell as well. Certification Summary 55


 Directory Services
 The UNIX and Linux standard directory service is called Network Information
 Service (NIS), which as been superseded by NIS+ and LDAP. As a matter of fact,
 Microsoft Services for UNIX and NetWare
 Services for UNIX both include an NIS service,
 which allows UNIX and Linux clients to
 authenticate to Active Directory or eDirectory.
 NIS is the directory These services also allow for the objects from
service used by UNIX and Linux to store Active Directory and eDirectory to be copied
a central list of network objects, such as or synchronized with the NIS directory,
users, groups, and printers. allowing UNIX clients to authenticate with
 NIS when the account was built originally in
 the other directory. Similar to Active Directory
 and eDirectory, NIS is a central repository of
 network resources (for example, users, group, printers) that is synchronized to other
 UNIX and Linux servers on the network.


CertifiCation Summary
 This chapter plays a significant role in this book. It serves as an introduction to some
 very key elements of networking, such as network topologies, cabling, and network
 architectures. Understanding the basic network structure takes a little knowledge
 of computing and information sharing. First, remember that for a network to exist,
 we need to have two things: the entities that want to share information or resources
 and the medium that enables the entities to communicate (a cable, such as coaxial
 or unshielded twisted-pair, or a wireless network). In this chapter, you looked at the
 various topologies that exist in networks: bus, star, ring, mesh, and wireless. You also
 looked at network terms, such as segments and backbones.
 You also looked at the various networking media and connectors. Knowing the
 various grades of cable can be important for the exam, as well as knowing what
 connectors go with what type of cabling. Make sure to review this before taking
 your exam.
 You also learned about some of the network operating systems for client/
 server networks: Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, Novell NetWare,
 and UNIX. 56 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts




3 tWo-Minute DriLL

 identifying Characteristics of a network
 q A network is made up of two basic components: the entities that need to
 share information or resources and the medium that enables the entities to
 communicate.
 q A peer-to-peer network is a network that has a number of workstations that
 connect to one another for the purpose of sharing resources. There is no dedi-
 cated server on a peer-to-peer network.
 q A server-based network is a network that has a central server installed with
 each client requesting resources from the server.

 identifying network topologies
 q Topology is the physical layout of computers, cables, and other components
 on a network.
 q Many networks are a combination of these topologies:
 q Bus
 q Star
 q Mesh
 q Ring
 q Wireless
 q A bus topology uses a main trunk to connect multiple computers. If there is a
 break in a cable, it will bring the entire network down.
 q In a star topology, all computers are connected through one central hub or
 switch. If there is a break in a cable, only the host that is connected to that
 cable is affected.
 q With a mesh topology, every workstation has a connection to every other
 component of the network. This type of topology is seen more commonly in
 something like the national telephone network. Two-Minute Drill 57


 q In a ring topology, all computers are connected in a ring with no beginning or
 end. Each system in the ring regenerates the signal. If there is a break in the
 ring, the entire network goes down.
 q In a wireless topology, radio frequencies are used instead of physical cables.
 Wireless clients connect to cells, or access points, through the use of a wire-
 less network card.
 q A backbone is the main cable segment in the network.


network Media and Connectors
 q Cabling is the LAN’s transmission medium.
 q Three primary types of physical media can be used: coaxial cable, twisted-pair
 cable, and fiber-optic cable.
 q Coax uses a copper core that carries an electrical signal. There are two types
 of coax: thinnet and thicknet. Hosts connect to thinnet through BNC
 connectors, whereas vampire taps and drop cables are used to connect to
 thicknet.
 q Twisted-pair cabling is a cable type similar to telephone cable, but there are
 eight wires instead of four. Telephone cables use an RJ-11 connector, whereas
 network cabling uses an RJ-45 connector.
 q Fiber-optic cabling has a glass or clear-plastic core that carries pulses of light.
 The straight tip (ST) and subscriber connector (SC) are connectors used
 with fiber-optic cabling.

access Methods
 q An access method determines how systems access the network or place data
 on the wire.
 q CSMA/CD is the access method used by Ethernet networks and involves a
 host sensing traffic on the wire. When the wire is free of traffic, the host can
 send its data.
 q Token passing is the access method used by Token Ring. When a system on a
 Token Ring network wants to send data it must wait to receive the token. 58 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 network architectures
 q A network architecture is made up of a certain cable type, access method,
 and topology.
 q Two popular Ethernet architectures are 10BaseT and 100BaseT. 10BaseT uses
 twisted-pair cabling at 10 Mbps (CAT 3) and uses CSMA/CD as the access
 method. 100BaseT runs at 100 Mbps using CAT 5 UTP cabling. Both archi-
 tectures use a star topology.
 q Token Ring is a network architecture that uses token passing as the access
 method and is configured in a star topology.

 network operating systems
 q The three most widely used network operating systems available are
 q Microsoft Windows Server 2003/2008
 q Novell NetWare
 q UNIX Self Test 59

identifying Characteristics of a network
 1. þ B. Computer systems sharing a common communication medium for the purpose of sharing
 information or devices is what a network is all about. The entities are usually workstations, and
 the medium is either a cable segment or a wireless medium such as an infrared signal.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because a network, by definition, is two or more computers
 connected to share information. These three choices do not allow two or more PCs to
 share information; they are only setups of several connected devices or a PC connected to a
 peripheral device.
 2. þ B. A peer-to-peer network has no dedicated servers. There are no hierarchical differences
 between the workstations in the network; each workstation can decide which resources are
 shared on the network. In a peer-to-peer network, all workstations are clients and servers at the
 same time.
 ý A is incorrect because this network type has a dedicated server. C and D are incorrect
 because a Windows Server 2003 and Novell NetWare 6.x constitute the server portion of the
 client/server network.
 3. þ C. The Microsoft term for a peer-to-peer network is a workgroup environment. If you
 have not installed your Windows clients in a domain (client/server), then they are sitting in a
 workgroup environment.
 ý A is incorrect because a client/server network is the opposite of a peer-to-peer network;
 a client/server network uses a central server. B is incorrect because domain is the term for a
 Microsoft server-based environment. D is incorrect because Active Directory is the term for
 Microsoft’s implementation of a directory server.
 4. þ D. Two remote offices that are spread over geographic distances constitute a wide area
 network (WAN).
 ý A is incorrect because it is the opposite of a WAN; a LAN is a network in a single
 geographic location. B is incorrect because there is no such thing in networking as a JAN. C is
 a metropolitan area network.
 5. þ A is correct. A file and print server is responsible for providing files and printers to users on
 the network.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because they are each their own type of server. A web server will
 host web sites; a directory server is a server that contains a central list of objects, such as user
 accounts on the network; and an application server runs a form of networking application, such
 as an e-mail or a database server program. 66 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



 6. þ C. An extranet allows selected individuals to see your corporate intranet.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. An intranet allows only individuals within your company to
 access the site; allowing anyone on the Internet to access it would make it an Internet-type
 application.

identifying network topologies
 7. þ C. The topology is the physical layout of computers, cables, and other components on a
 network. Many networks are a combination of the various topologies.
 ý A is incorrect because a segment is a part of a LAN that is separated by routers or bridges
 from the rest of the LAN. B is incorrect because a backbone is the main part of cabling that
 joins all of the segments together and handles the bulk of the network traffic. D is incorrect
 because a protocol is a set of rules governing the communication between PCs; a protocol can
 be thought of as similar to a language.
 8. þ B. In a star topology, all computers are connected through one central hub or switch. A
 star topology actually comes from the days of the mainframe system. The mainframe system had
 a centralized point at which the terminals connected.
 ý A is incorrect because a bus topology uses one cable to connect multiple computers. C
 is incorrect because the mesh network has every PC connected to every other PC and can
 resemble a spider’s web. D is incorrect because a ring topology resembles a circle or ring. E is
 incorrect because there is no physical cabling to represent the topology; it is represented by a
 bubble or cell.
 9. þ C. A mesh topology is not very common in computer networking, but you have to know
 it for the exam. The mesh topology is seen more commonly with something like the national
 telephone network. With a mesh topology, every workstation has a connection to every other
 component of the network.
 ý A is incorrect because a bus topology uses one cable to connect multiple computers.
 B is incorrect because a star topology is made up of a central point or hub with cables coming
 from the hub and extending to the PCs. D is incorrect because this topology resembles a
 circle or ring. E is incorrect because there is no physical cabling to represent the topology; it is
 represented by a bubble or cell.
10. þ A. A bus topology uses terminators on any loose end of the bus. The terminator is designed
 to absorb the signal so that it does not bounce back on the wire and collide with other data.
 ý B is incorrect because a star topology does not use terminators; it uses a central hub or
 switch that connects systems to the network. C is incorrect because a mesh topology has
 each system connecting to each other system. D is incorrect because a ring topology has no
 beginning and no end, so there are no “loose ends” to put a terminator on. E is incorrect
 because a wireless network does not use cables at all. Self Test Answers 67


networking Media and Connectors
11. þ D. RJ-45 is not a network medium. Three primary types of physical media can be used:
 coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, and fiber-optic cable. Transmission rates that can be supported
 on each of these physical media are measured in millions of bits per second (Mbps). RJ-45 is a
 connector type for twisted-pair cabling.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect because they are all common network media.
12. þ B. 10Base2 (thinnet) has a distance limitation of 185 meters. 10Base5 (thicknet) has
 a distance limitation of 500 meters, and 10BaseT (twisted-pair) has a distance limitation of
 100 meters.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because these are not the distances covered by thinnet.
13. þ C. Fiber-optic cabling sends pulses of light through a glass core.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because each carry an electrical signal.
14. þ A. All twisted-pair cabling is limited to 100 meters.
 ý B is incorrect because 185 meters is the maximum distance of thinnet cabling; D is
 incorrect because 500 meters is the maximum distance of thicknet cabling. C is incorrect; there
 is no cable type that has a 250-meter maximum distance.
15. þ D. 500 meters is the maximum distance of thicknet cabling.
 ý A is incorrect because all twisted-pair cabling is limited to 100 meters. B is incorrect
 because 185 meters is the maximum distance of thinnet cabling. C is incorrect because there is
 no cable type that has a 250-meter maximum distance.
16. þ B. 100BaseT uses twisted-pair that runs at 100 Mbps. CAT 5 is twisted-pair cabling type
 that runs at 100 Mbps.
 ý A is incorrect because CAT 3 runs at 10 Mbps. C is incorrect because thinnet runs at
 10 Mbps and is known as 10Base2. D is incorrect. Although fiber optic can run at 100 Mbps, it
 is not used in 100BaseT.
17. þ A and D. Fiber-optic cabling uses a number of connector styles—two of which are the SC
 and ST connectors.
 ý B and C are incorrect. RJ-45 is used by twisted-pair cabling, and BNC is used by thinnet.
18. þ C. Single-mode fiber-optic cabling has a maximum distance of approximately 2 km.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect distances for single-mode fiber, although 300 meters is the
 maximum distance of multimode fiber.
19. þ D. Fiber-optic cabling is immune to outside interference and crosstalk.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Thinnet, thicknet, and twisted-pair cabling are susceptible to
 outside interference. 68 Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts



20. þ B. The BNC connector is the connector used by 10Base2.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. The SC connector is used by fiber optic, the RJ-45 connector is
 used by twisted-pair, and the RJ-11 connector is used by the telephone cable.
21. þ A. To create a crossover cable, you would switch wire 1 and 2 with wire 3 and 6 on one end
 of the cable.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. These combinations are not used to create crossover cables.

access Methods
22. þ B. Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is the access method
 that 100BaseT uses. With CSMA/CD, a host will sense the wire to see if it is free; only if the
 wire is free of data will the host send data on the wire.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Baseband is not an access method. CSMA/CA and token
 passing are access methods but are not used by 100BaseT.
23. þ D. Token Ring uses the token-passing access method. With token passing, a host must
 have the token before submitting data on the wire.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Baseband is not an access method, CSMA/CA is used in
 AppleTalk networks, and CSMA/CD is used in Ethernet environments.

network architectures
24. þ D. Ethernet (CSMA/CD) is defined by IEEE 802.3
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. These architectures are not defined by 802.3, but be aware that
 Token Ring is defined by IEEE 802.5.
25. þ A. 1000BaseLX uses single-mode fiber-optic cabling.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. 1000BaseSX uses multimode fiber-optic cabling, 1000BaseCX
 uses coaxial cabling, and 1000BaseTX uses CAT 5e or above.
26. þ C. Following the 5-4-3 rule, you are allowed to have five network segments, joined by four
 repeaters, while three of those segments are populated with nodes.
 ý A, B, and D are all incorrect because they are not the number of populated segments in a
 10Base2 network.
27. þ E. 10BaseFL uses fiber-optic cabling. Remember to watch the characters at the end of the
 architecture name to determine what the cable type is—“FL” is for fiber link.
 ý A, B, C, and D are incorrect. STP, thinnet, thicknet, and CAT 3 UTP are all cable types
 but are not used in 10BaseFL. Self Test Answers 69


28. þ B. 1000BaseSX uses multimode fiber cabling. Remember that multimode cannot go as far
 as single mode, and also the “SX” in the architecture is for “short range”—multimode for short
 range, single mode for long range.
 ý A, C, and D are all incorrect. 1000BaseLX uses single-mode fiber, 1000BaseCX uses
 coaxial cable, and 1000BaseTX uses twisted-pair.

network operating systems
29. þ D. Developed from the VMS platform many years ago, Microsoft Windows NT has grown
 into a very popular network operating system with a new and different interface.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. The graphical interface and look and feel of the other operating
 systems in the Windows family made Windows NT very popular among users and network
 administrators. Windows 95 was simply a great enhancement of Windows for Workgroups.
 NetWare and UNIX were not based on VMS.
30. þ A. Originally developed at Bell Labs, UNIX is a very popular operating system for powerful
 networking and database management. UNIX boasts three key features that make it powerful:
 multitasking, multiuser, and networking capabilities.

network Protocols
 Understanding the concepts of networking protocols is critical to being able to
 troubleshoot communication problems in networking environments. This section
 will introduce you to four common network protocols found in networking
 environments and the difference between routable and nonroutable protocols.
 A network protocol is a language that is used by systems that wish to
 communicate with one another. If two systems wish to communicate (or talk) with
 one another, they need to speak the same language (or protocol). Let’s look at an
 example of a communication problem that could occur when two persons who want
 to talk are not speaking the same language. Let’s say that you were traveling the
 country on your summer vacation and took a pit stop into a fast food restaurant.
 When ordering your favorite meal, you would need to ensure that you spoke the
 same language as the person taking the order. If you speak English and the waiter
 speaks French, you would be giving your order, but the waiter would not be able to
 understand you. The same thing will happen on the network when two systems use
 two totally different protocols—everyone is talking but no one is communicating.
 The first step to networking is making sure that the two systems that are trying to
 talk have the same protocol installed.
 Four of the major protocols found in networking environments today are

 n NetBEUI
 n IPX/SPX
 n AppleTalk
 n TCP/IP


netbeUi
 NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI) is a transport protocol developed by
 IBM but adopted by Microsoft for use in earlier versions of Windows and DOS.
 NetBEUI commonly was found in smaller networks due to the fact that it is a
 nonroutable protocol. A nonroutable protocol is a protocol that sends data, but the
 data is unable to cross a router to reach other networks; communication is limited
 to the local LAN only. The fact that NetBEUI is a nonroutable protocol has limited
 the use of NetBEUI on networks today dramatically. Network Protocols 73


 NetBEUI was first implemented with
 LAN Manager networks and became popular
 in smaller Microsoft networks back in the
 NetBEUI is a nonroutable Windows 3.11, Windows 95, and Windows 98
 protocol built by IBM but was popular days. NetBEUI is an extremely efficient and
 with earlier versions of Microsoft peer-to- simple protocol with little overhead because of
 peer networks. its inability to route packets. One of the major
 advantages of NetBEUI is that it is extremely
 simple to install and configure. There is minimal
 configuration required to allow the protocol to work—you install it, specify a unique
 computer name, and it works! Exercise 2-1 demonstrates how to install NetBEUI on
 a Windows 2000 system.

 Be sure to take a look at Exercise 2-1 in the LabBook.pdf that is found on the
CertCam 2–1
 CD-ROM or watch the CertCam training video found on the CD.



What is netbios?
 NetBEUI has a close friend, NetBIOS (short for Network Basic Input/Output
 System), with which it works closely when communicating with systems on the
 network. NetBIOS is an application programming interface (API) that is used
 to make network calls to remote systems. When you install NetBEUI, it includes
 the NetBIOS protocol, and NetBEUI relies on NetBIOS for session management
 functionality. Also, NetBIOS is nonroutable but may be installed with other
 routable protocols such as IPX/SPX or TCP/IP to allow NetBIOS traffic to travel
 across networks. NetBIOS has two communication modes:

 n Session mode Is used for connection-oriented communication in which
 NetBIOS would be responsible for establishing a session with the target
 system, monitoring the session to detect any errors in transmission, and then
 recovering from those errors by retransmitting any data that went missing or
 was corrupt.
 n Datagram mode Is used for connectionless communication in which a
 session is not needed. Datagram mode also is used for any broadcast by
 NetBIOS. Datagram mode does not support error detection and correction
 services, which are therefore the responsibility of the application using
 NetBIOS. 74 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 Now that you understand a little bit about NetBIOS, here is a list of facts about
 NetBIOS and NetBEUI:

 n NetBIOS is a session protocol, whereas NetBEUI is a transport protocol
 (more on session and transport later in this chapter, when you learn about the
 OSI model).
 n NetBIOS is used by other protocols as well, such as TCP/IP.
 n Since NetBIOS is not a transport protocol, it does not directly support
 routing but depends on one of three transport protocols—TCP/IP, IPX/SPX,
 or NetBEUI—to do this.
 n NetBIOS uses NetBIOS names as a method of identifying systems on
 the network. A NetBIOS name, also known as a computer name, can be
 a maximum of 16 bytes long—15 bytes for the name and 1 byte for the
 NetBIOS name suffix (a code at the end of the name representing the service
 running). The NetBIOS computer name must be unique on the LAN.



iPX/sPX
 Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) is a protocol suite
 (which means there are many protocols in one) that was developed by Novell and
 was very popular on older NetWare networks. However, newer versions of NetWare
 (NetWare 5.x and above) have moved away from it and are using TCP/IP as the
 preferred protocol. Microsoft refers to IPX/SPX as NWLink (NetWare Link).
 The IPX protocol of the IPX/SPX
 protocol suite is responsible for the routing of
 information across the network. IPX/SPX is a
 routable protocol, so its addressing scheme must
 IPX/SPX is a routable be able to identify each system on the network
 protocol that was built by Novell and and the network it exists on. The network
 used in older versions of NetWare. administrator assigns each network a network
 ID. An IPX network ID is an eight-character
 hexadecimal value—for example, 0BADBEEF.
 A complete IPX address is made up of the network ID , a period (.), and then
 the six-byte MAC address of the network card (a unique address burned into the
 network card) in the system. For example, the computer I am sitting at right now has
 a MAC address of 00-90-4B-4C-C1-59. If my system were connected to network ID Network Protocols 75


 0BADBEEF, then my IPX network address would be 0BADBEEF.00904B4CC159.
 The fact that the MAC address is used in the address means that there is no need to
 have it resolved when communication occurs—which will make the protocol more
 efficient than other protocols such as TCP/IP, which does require the IP address to
 be resolved to a MAC address.
 IPX/SPX is not as easy to configure as NetBEUI. When doing an IPX installation,
 you will need to be familiar with configuration issues such as the network number
 and frame type (shown in Figure 2-1).

 n Network number Is the number assigned to the Novell network segment.
 It is a hexadecimal value, eight digits maximum.
 n Frame type Is the format of the packet that is used by the network. It is
 important to make sure that all systems on the network are configured for the
 same frame type. For example, if I wish want to connect to SERVER1, which
 uses the frame type of 802.2, then I would need to ensure that my frame
 type was set to 802.2—otherwise, I would not be able to communicate with
 SERVER1. The four major frame types are 802.2, 802.3, ETHERNET_SNAP,
 and ETHERNET_II.



 figUre 2-1

Configuring the
IPX/SPX protocol 76 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 The Microsoft operating systems default to an auto setting on the frame type,
 which allows the IPX/SPX protocol to “sense” the frame type being used on the
 network and configure itself for that frame type. This has made the configuration
 of IPX/SPX much easier during the past few years.

 If you are working on a network where there are multiple frame types
 configured, such as 802.2 and 802.3, the clients that are configured to
 autodetect the frame type will configure themselves for 802.2, because it is
 the default frame type.

 While IPX is responsible for the routing of packets, it is also a connectionless,
 unreliable transport. Unreliable means IPX packets are sent to a destination without
 requiring the destination to acknowledge receiving those packets. Connectionless
 means that no session is established between sender and receiver before transmitting
 data. SPX is the protocol in the IPX/SPX protocol suite that is responsible for
 reliable delivery. SPX is a connection-oriented protocol that will ensure that packets
 that are not received at the destination are retransmitted on the wire.
 To install IPX/SPX in Windows, you will go to your Local Area Connection
 properties and then choose the Install button. When shown a list of components to
 install, you then select Protocol and then click Add to add a protocol. When shown
 the list of protocols, you then select the NWLink IPX/SPX entry and click OK. To
 configure the network number and frame type, go to the properties of NWLink.
 Exercise 2-2 demonstrates the steps needed to install and configure IPX/SPX on a
 Windows 2000 system.

 Be sure to take a look at Exercise 2-2 in the LabBook.pdf file that is found on
ON THE CD

appletalk
 AppleTalk is a routable protocol that is used primarily in Macintosh environments
 to connect multiple systems together in a network environment. AppleTalk was
 implemented in two phases, known as phase 1 and phase 2, with the second phase
 being more popular today:

 n Phase 1 Was designed for small workgroup environments and therefore
 supports a much smaller number of nodes on the network. Phase 1 supports

 a single network number, and only one zone is allowed in a nonextended
 network. A zone is a logical grouping of nodes—the network administrator
 will assign nodes to a particular zone.

tCP/iP
 Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the most common
 protocol used today. A routable protocol, TCP/IP is the protocol on which the
 Internet is built. TCP/IP is very robust and commonly is associated with UNIX and
 Linux systems.
 TCP/IP originally was designed in the 1970s to be used by the Defense Advanced
 Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)
 to connect dissimilar systems across the country. This design required the capability
 to cope with unstable network conditions. Therefore, the design of TCP/IP included
 the capability to reroute packets.
 One of the major advantages of TCP/IP
 was the fact that it could be used to connect

 drawbacks? TCP/IP has two major drawbacks:

 n Configuration TCP/IP is a protocol that requires configuration, and to
 administer it, you need to be familiar with IP addresses, subnet masks, and
 default gateways—not complicated topics once you are familiar with them,
 but there is a bit of a learning curve compared to installing NetBEUI.

 insecure protocol. If security is of concern, you need to make certain that you

Routable vs. Nonroutable Protocols
 We have discussed each of the four major protocols, and you have learned that
 NetBEUI is a nonroutable protocol, whereas IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, and TCP/IP are
 routable protocols. What exactly is a routable protocol? A routable protocol is a
 protocol whose packets may leave your network, pass through your router, and be
 delivered to a remote network, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 A nonroutable protocol is a protocol that does not have the capability to cross a
 router to be sent from one network to another network. This is due to the fact that

 in Figure 2-3, because there is no routing information in the packet such as a layer-3

the osi Model
 In 1984, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defined a
 standard, or set of rules, for manufacturers of networking components that would
 allow these networking components to communicate in dissimilar environments.
 This standard is known as the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model and is a 80 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 model made up of seven layers. Each layer of the OSI model is responsible for a
 specific function or task within the stages of network communication. The seven
 layers of the OSI model, from highest to lowest, are application, presentation,
 session, transport, network, data link, and physical. Network communication starts
 at the application layer of the OSI model (on the sending system) and works its way
 down through the layers to the physical layer. The information then passes along
 the communication medium to the receiving computer, which works its way back
 up the layers starting at the physical layer. Figure 2-4 shows an example of packets
 being transmitted down through the OSI layers of the sending computer, across the
 medium, and back up the OSI layers on the receiving computer. Be sure to refer to
 this figure frequently when going through this section.
 Each layer of the OSI model is responsible for certain functions within the
 process of sending data from one system to another. Each layer is responsible for
 communicating with the layers immediately above it and below it. For example,
 the presentation layer will receive information from the application layer, format
 it appropriately, and then pass it to the session layer. As another example, the
 presentation layer will never deal directly with the network or data link layers.

 the Network+ exam. COMPUTER1 will be known as the sending
 computer, and SERVER1 will be known as the
 receiving computer, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 The data exchange starts with COMPUTER1 sending a request to SERVER1. It
 is important to notice as you progress through the layers that whatever function is
 performed at a layer on the sending system must be undone at the exact layer on
 the receiving system. For example, if the presentation layer compresses the data on
 the sending system, the presentation layer will decompress the data on the receiving
 system before passing the data up to the application layer.


Layer 7:the application Layer
 The application layer running on the sending system (COMPUTER1) is responsible
 for the actual request to be made. This could be any type of networking request—a
 web request using a web browser (HTTP), an e-mail delivery request using SMTP,

 or a file system request using the network client redirector software. On the
 receiving system, the application layer would be responsible for passing the request
 to the appropriate application or service on that system. In our example, we will
 assume that you are sitting at COMPUTER1 and you have typed the address of
 SERVER1 into your web browser to create an HTTP request.


Layer 6:the Presentation Layer
 After the request is made, the application layer passes the data down to the
 presentation layer, where it is to be formatted so that the data (or request) can be
 interpreted by the receiving system. When the presentation layer receives data
 from the application layer to be sent over the network, it makes sure that the data
 is in the proper format—if it is not, the presentation layer converts the data. On
 the receiving system, when the presentation layer receives network data from the
 session layer, it makes sure that the data is in the proper format and once again
 converts it if it is not.
 Formatting functions that could occur at the presentation layer could be
 compression, encryption, and ensuring that the character code set can be interpreted
 on the other side. For example, if we choose to compress our data from the
 application that we are using, the application layer will pass that request to the
 presentation layer, but it will be the presentation layer that does the compression.
 Now, at some point, this data must be decompressed so that it can be read. When
 the data reaches the presentation layer of the receiving computer, it will decompress
 the data and pass the data up to the application layer.


Layer 5:the session Layer
 The session layer manages the dialog between computers. It does this by establishing,
 managing, and terminating communications between two computers. When a
 session is established, three distinct phases are involved. In the establishment phase,
 the requestor initiates the service and the rules for communication between the two
 systems. These rules could include such things as who transmits and when, as well as
 how much data can be sent at a time. Both systems must agree on the rules; the rules
 are like the etiquette of the conversation. Once the rules are established, the data
 transfer phase begins. Both sides know how to talk to each other, the most efficient
 methods to use, and how to detect errors, all because of the rules defined in the first
 phase. Finally, termination occurs when the session is complete, and communication
 ends in an orderly fashion. The OSI Model 83


 In our example, COMPUTER1 creates a session with SERVER1 at this point, and
 they agree on the rules of the conversation.


Layer 4:the transport Layer
 The transport layer handles transport functions such as reliable and unreliable
 delivery of the data. For reliable transport protocols, the transport layer works hard
 to ensure reliable delivery of data to its destinations. On the sending system, the
 transport layer is responsible for breaking the data into smaller packets, so that if
 retransmission is required, only the packets missing will be sent. Missing packets are
 determined by the fact that the transport layer receives acknowledgments (ACKs)
 from the remote system, when the remote system receives the packets. At the
 receiving system, the transport layer will be responsible for opening all of the packets
 and reconstructing the original message.
 Another function of the transport layer is segment sequencing. Sequencing is a
 connection-oriented service that takes segments that are received out of order and
 resequences them in the right order. For example, if I send you five packets and
 you receive the packets in this order (by their sequence number): 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, the
 transport layer will read the sequence numbers and assemble them in the correct
 order.
 The transport layer also enables the option
 of specifying a “service address” for the services
 or application on the source and destination
 TCP is an example of a computers to specify what application the
 transport protocol responsible for reliable request came from and what application the
 delivery, whereas UDP is an example request is headed for. All modern operating

 unreliable delivery. program has a unique service address. Service
 addresses that are well defined (by networking
 standards, for example) are called well-known
 addresses. Service addresses also are called sockets or ports by protocols such as
 TCP/IP.
 At this point in our example, the request is broken into packets in preparation
 for being delivered across the network, and transport layer information (such as the
 transport protocol being used and any additional transport information) is appended
 to the request. In this example, because we are dealing with a TCP/IP application,
 the source port and destination port are added. 84 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards

Layer 3:the network Layer
 The network layer is responsible for managing logical addressing information in the
 packets and the delivery, or routing, of those packets by using information stored in
 a routing table. The routing table is a list of available destinations that are stored in
 memory on the routers (more on routing in Chapter 5).
 The network layer is responsible for working with logical addresses. The logical
 addresses are address types that are used to uniquely identify a system on the
 network, but at the same time identify the network that system resides on. This is The OSI Model 85


 unlike a MAC address (the physical address burned into the network card), because
 a MAC address just gives the system a unique address and does not specify or imply
 what network the system lives on. The logical address is used by network-layer
 protocols to deliver the packets to the correct network.
 In our example, the request is coming from a
 web browser and destined for a web server, both
 of which are applications that run on TCP/IP.
 At this point, the network layer will add the

 so that the receiving system will know where
 the packet came from.


Layer 2:the Data Link Layer
 The data link layer is responsible for converting the data from a packet to a pattern
 of electrical bit signals that will be used to send the data across the communication
 medium. On the receiving system, the electrical signals will be converted to packets
 by the data link layer and then passed up to the network layer for further processing.
 The data link layer is divided into two sublayers:

 n Logical link control (LLC) Is responsible for error correction and control
 functions.
 n Media access control (MAC) Determines the physical addressing of the
 hosts. It also determines how the host places traffic on the medium, for
 example CSMA/CD versus Token Passing.

 The MAC sublayer maintains physical device addresses (commonly referred to
 as MAC addresses) for communicating with other devices on the network. These
 physical addresses are burned into the network cards and constitute the low-level
 address used to determine the source and destination of network traffic.
 In our example, once the sending system’s

 information, the data link layer will append

 packets to binary signals. On the receiving system, the data link layer will convert
 the signals passed to it by the physical layer to data and then pass the packets to the
 network layer for further processing.


Layer 1:the Physical Layer
 The bottom layer of the OSI hierarchy is concerned only with moving bits of data
 onto and off the network medium.
 This includes the physical topology (or structure) of the network, the electrical
 and physical aspects of the medium used, and encoding and timing of bit
 transmission and reception.
 In our example, once the network layer has appended the logical addresses and
 passed the data to the data link layer where the MAC addresses have been appended
 and the data was converted to electrical signals, the data is then passed to the
 physical layer so that it can be released on the communication medium. On the
 receiving system, the physical layer will pick the data up off the wire and pass it to
 the data link layer, where it will ensure that the signal is destined for that system by
 reading the destination MAC address.
 Now that you have been introduced to the seven-layer OSI model, look at an
 exercise to put your newfound knowledge to the test.

 Be sure to take a look at Exercise 2-3 in the LabBook.pdf file that is found on

Protocols and the osi Layers
 Different protocols work at different levels of the OSI model. Here, we look at a few
 of the main protocols for this exam, apply them to the OSI model, and see how they
 fit in the OSI model’s seven layers. For more information on protocols and services
 check out Chapter 4.

 iPX
 IPX is an extremely fast, streamlined protocol that is not connection oriented. IPX
 was once fairly common because of its widespread use on Novell NetWare. IPX is
 a routable protocol that is located at the network layer of the OSI model. Because
 it is also an unreliable connectionless transport, IPX also applies to layer 4—the The OSI Model 87

layer 3. network interface card (NIC). For a number
 of years, IPX over Ethernet was the default
 use of NICs.

 sPX
 Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) is a transport protocol used by IPX for
 connection-oriented communication. It is responsible for breaking the message
 into manageable packets and ensuring the data reaches the destination. SPX is the
 equivalent to TCP but for the IPX/SPX protocol suite. Because SPX runs at the
 transport layer, it is considered a layer-4 protocol.

 iP
 The Internet Protocol (IP) in the TCP/IP protocol suite performs the same routing
 functions that IPX does for the IPX/SPX protocol suite. IP is responsible for the logical
 addressing and routing of messages across the network. IP does not ensure the delivery
 of the packets; that is the responsibility of higher-layer protocols, such as TCP.
 The logical address that IP uses is known as an IP address and looks similar to
 192.168.3.200—which is different from the physical address (MAC address), which
 looks like 00-02-3F-6B-25-13. The logical address is responsible for identifying the
 network the system resides on along with an address of the system, whereas a MAC
 address is very flat and identifies only the physical system on the LAN—not “where”
 the system resides.
 IP is fully capable of running over either

 appropriate NIC is used. IP over Ethernet is the

protocol and is responsible for logical today, because Ethernet is much less expensive
addressing—as a result, an IP address is than Token Ring and because TCP/IP is used
referred to as a layer-3 address. widely on the Internet. 88 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 tCP
 The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer protocol that is
 responsible for breaking the data into manageable packets and ensuring that the
 packets reach their destination. TCP is considered a connection-oriented protocol,
 which means that it relies on a session being first established. This is different from
 a connectionless communication, which just sends the data out and if it reaches the
 destination, great; if not, no big deal. With connection-oriented protocols, a session
 is established through introductions. (“Hi, I’m Glen Clarke. Nice to meet you, I am
 going to send you some data.”) Connection-oriented protocols will monitor that
 session to ensure that the packets have reached their destination.

 UDP
 The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite and is
 the brother of TCP. When you send data on a TCP/IP network and if you need a
 connection-oriented conversation, you have
 learned you would use the TCP protocol. But
 what protocol do we use if we want to have a

 determine whether it is connection oriented
 or not.

 nfs
 The Network File System (NFS) is a protocol for file sharing that enables a user
 to use network disks as though they were connected to the local machine. NFS
 was created by Sun Microsystems for use on Solaris, Sun’s version of UNIX. NFS
 is still used frequently in the UNIX and Linux worlds and is available for use with
 nearly all operating systems. NFS is a protocol that is used universally by the UNIX
 community. Vendor and third-party software products enable other operating
 systems to use NFS. It has gained acceptance with many companies and can be
 added to nearly any operating system. In addition to file sharing, NFS enables you
 to share printers. NFS is located in the application layer of the OSI model and is
 considered a member of the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary reason to use the
 NFS protocol is to access resources located on a UNIX server or to share resources
 with someone working on a UNIX workstation. The OSI Model 89


 sMb and novell nCP
 Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB) and Novell’s NetWare Core Protocol
 (NCP) are protocols that are implemented in redirectors. A redirector is software that
 intercepts requests, formats them according to the protocol in use, and passes the
 message to a lower-level protocol for delivery. Redirectors also intercept incoming
 messages, process the instructions, and pass them to the correct upper-level
 application for additional processing.
 SMB and NCP are used primarily for file and printer sharing in Microsoft and
 Novell networks, respectively, and are considered application-layer protocols.

 sMtP
 The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is the protocol that defines the
 structure of Internet mail messages. SMTP uses
 a well-defined syntax for transferring messages.
 An SMTP session includes initializing the

 body of the e-mail message.

 ftP and tftP
 The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standardized method of transferring files
 between two machines. FTP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that
 the protocol verifies that packets successfully reach their destinations.
 The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) has the same purpose and function as
 FTP, except that it is not a connection-oriented protocol and does not verify that
 packets reach their destinations. By not verifying that data has been successfully
 transferred to its destination and therefore requiring less overhead to establish
 and maintain a connection, TFTP is able to operate faster than FTP. TFTP has no
 authentication mechanism, whereas FTP can require a username and password.

 DeCnet
 DECnet is a proprietary protocol developed by the Digital Equipment Corporation
 for use primarily in WANs. You can run DECnet on an Ethernet network, but it is
 done infrequently. DECnet is a routable protocol. 90 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards

 credit card number in the packet. Figure 2-6 shows the user filling in the credit card
 number on a web page.

 10. When you start Network Monitor, it may ask you to select a network (which
 means choosing your network card). Select the network card on the left that
 shows a dial-up adapter on the right as being false (shown next). This will
 be your network card, as opposed to the modem on the system. We want to
 capture traffic from this network card eventually. 94 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 11. Once the network card has been selected, you should have Network Monitor
 on the screen in front of you. You want to view network traffic that was
 captured previously, so choose File | Open.
 12. In the Open dialog box, open the HTTPTraffic.cap file located in the
 LabFilesPacketCaptures folder.
 13. The contents of the packet capture are displayed. Notice that there are
 24 frames (numbers listed down the left) captured and that frame 16 is the
 actual HTTP Post Request (seen next), which is the form’s information
 posted to the server. This is the phase where the credit card number was
 submitted. We will use frame 16 as our learning tool to view network traffic. The OSI Model 95


14. Double-click frame 16 to view the details of the traffic (shown in the
 accompanying illustration).




15. The window is divided into three panes; the top pane is the summary pane
 listing all the frames, the middle pane is the detail pane showing your packet
 details, and the bottom pane is showing the hex data for that frame. Ensure
 that frame 16 is still selected in the summary pane so that you can investigate
 your packet.
16. In the detail pane (middle part of the screen), double-click Ethernet, which
 will expand the Ethernet section showing you the source and destination
 (shown in the accompanying illustration) Ethernet addresses or MAC
 addresses. 96 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards




 17. Record the source MAC address, which is the system that sent the packet, in
 the blanks.

 click the IP section, you will see what layer-3 addresses (IP Address) are the
 source of the packet and the destination of the packet. The OSI Model 97




20. Fill in the following information:
 Where is the packet headed? ________________________
 Where did the packet come from? _____________________
 Hint: View the source and destination addresses.
21. You also can see what transport protocol was used by IP to deliver this packet.
 Two lines above the source IP address, you can see that IP is using TCP, a
 connection-oriented layer-4 protocol, to ensure that the packet reaches the
 destination (shown in the accompanying illustration). 98 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards




 22. If you double-click the IP heading, you will collapse the details of IP. Let’s
 look at the application protocol information for this packet. You want to see
 the credit card number that was typed into the web page. In the details pane,
 double-click HTTP to expand the detailed application information.
 23. Select the last piece of information for HTTP, which is the HTTP: Data: line.
 To view the data that was typed into the browser, look in the bottom right of
 the screen (shown in the next illustration). The OSI Model 99




 24. What was the credit card number? __________________
 25. Close Network Monitor.

 This exercise has shown you how to view layer-2 information in a packet,
such as the source and destination MAC addresses. It has also shown you how to
view logical address information, such as the source and destination IP addresses,
which were found with layer-3 information. You also saw how the layer-3 protocol
(IP) relies on TCP to ensure delivery of the information. Finally, you viewed the
application information that was submitted with the request. This will hopefully
show you why it is important to ensure that you are using an encryption protocol to
encrypt the data typed into an application. 100 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards

802 Project standards
 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a large and
 respected professional organization that is also active in defining standards. The
 802 committee of the IEEE defines one set of standards dear to the hearts of
 most network professionals. Twelve subcommittees of the 802 committee define
 low-level LAN and WAN access protocols. Most of the protocols defined by the
 802 committee reside in the physical and data link layers of the OSI model.


ieee 802 Categories
 As the use of LANs increased, standards were needed to define consistency and
 compatibility between vendors. The IEEE began a project in February 1980, known
 as Project 802 for the year and month it began. IEEE 802 is a set of standards given 802 Project Standards 101


 to the various LAN architectures such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and ArcNet by the
 LAN standards committee. The goal of the committee was to define more of the
 OSI’s data link layer, which already contained the LLC and MAC sublayers. Several
 802 subcommittee protocols are the heart of PC networking. Although there are
 a number of 802 project categories, a few of them are focused on for the exam and
 therefore will get a little more focus here in this section.

 802.3
 Based on the original Ethernet network from DIX (Digital-Intel-Xerox), 802.3 is the
 standard for Ethernet networks today. The only difference between 802.3 Ethernet
 and DIX Ethernet V.2 is the frame type. The two Ethernet networks can use the
 same physical network, but devices on one standard cannot communicate with
 devices on the other standard.
 The MAC sublayer uses carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
 (CSMA/CD) for access to the physical medium.
 CSMA/CD keeps devices on the network from
 interfering with one another when trying to
 transmit; if they do, a collision occurs. To reduce
 Remember that Ethernet
 collisions, CSMA/CD devices listen to the

 network before transmitting. If the network is
 “quiet” (no other devices are transmitting), the
 device can send its data. Because two devices
 can think the network is clear and start transmitting at the same time (which
 would result in a collision), all devices listen as they transmit. If a device detects
 another device transmitting at the same time, a collision occurs. The device stops
 transmitting and sends a signal to alert other nodes about the collision. Then, all
 the nodes stop transmitting and wait a random amount of time before they begin the
 process again.
 CSMA/CD doesn’t stop collisions from happening, but it helps manage the
 situations when they do occur. In fact, collisions are a normal part of Ethernet
 operation. You need to become concerned only when collisions begin to occur
 frequently.
 Ethernet has evolved over the years to include a number of popular specifications.
 These specifications are due in part to the media variety they employ, such as
 coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cabling. 102 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards



 n The 10Base5 specification, commonly referred to as thicknet, was the
 original Ethernet specification, and it has a maximum distance of 500 meters

 coaxial cable than 10Base5 and has a maximum distance of 185 meters
 (approximately 607 feet) with a maximum speed of 10 Mbps.

 that have been developed in the 802.3 category,
 and those are shown in Table 2-2.

 802.5
 Although Token Ring was first designed in the late 1960s, IBM’s token-passing
 implementation did not become a standard until 1985. It became IEEE standard
 802.5 under the IEEE Project 802. The 802.5 standard was modeled after the IBM
 Token Ring network, which had been in use for many years before the standard was
 even developed.
 The 802.5 network introduced a unique access method—token passing. The
 Token Ring IEEE 802.5 standard passes a special frame known as the token around
 the network. This token is generated by the first computer that comes online on the
 Token Ring network. When a workstation wants to transmit data, it grabs the token
 and then begins transmitting. This computer
 will send a data frame on the network with
 the address of the destination computer. The
 destination computer receives the data frame,

 back to the destination computer, indicating

 workstation has finished transmitting, the
 token is released back on to the network. This ensures that workstations will not
 communicate on the network simultaneously, as in the CSMA/CD access method. 802 Project Standards 103

 802.11
 The IEEE 802.11 standard is the standard that addresses wireless networking
 (discussed in Chapter 7).
 This standard includes the wireless access point (WAP) devices and the wireless
 network interface cards (NICs) that are used to send and receive broadcasts from the
 cell or WAP device.
 The WAPs and wireless NICs can be set to use different frequencies to allow for
 cell overlap. This technology does not include the same technology used by cell
 phones to manage movement of PCs or mobile devices. The wireless NIC is set to a
 specific frequency and must be changed manually to be able to communicate with
 another cell. This means that a PC cannot be moved from one cell area to another
 without changing frequency, unless for some reason the cells operate on the same
 frequency and have no overlap of coverage area.
 There are a few wireless standards that were developed in the IEEE 802.11
 category, and those are listed as follows:

 n 802.11a Supports speeds of 54 Mbps at
 frequencies ranging from 5.725 GHz to
 5.850 GHz. 802.11a wireless components

 n 802.11g Supports speeds of 54 Mbps at the same frequency range as 802.11b,
 which allows devices from the two standards to coexist. For example, I have
 an 802.11b wireless access point, but I am connected to it with my 802.11g
 wireless network card. I am getting only the 11 Mbps transfer rate because it is
 the lowest common denominator between the two standards.
 n 802.11n Is a new wireless project that runs at 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz and is
 backward compatible with 802.11a/b/g standards. The goal of 802.11n is to
 increase the bandwidth and the range. 802.11n has data transfer rates of over
 100 Mbps!

 You will need to be familiar with the IEEE 802 projects that have been
 mentioned, and the exam will focus on those, but you should be familiar with the
 other 802 standards as well. Table 2-3 lists most of the 802 project standards.

 the IEEE standards on the exam, especially and wireless.

 In this chapter, you have learned about some of the more popular network protocols,
 such as NetBEUI, IPX/SPX, and TCP/IP. You have learned about the advantages
 and disadvantages of these protocols, which ones are routable, and which ones are
 nonroutable.
 You also have learned that in order for all of the different manufacturers of
 networking components to build technologies that will work together, there had to
 be some standards defined. There are two major standards that manufacturers follow:

 network Protocols
 q Packets and protocols are the fundamental building blocks of data transmis-
 sion over the network.
 q Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) is the
 protocol most commonly used with older versions of Novell NetWare.
 q IPX/SPX is the fastest routable network protocol suite available.
 q The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the most
 common protocol used today. TCP/IP, a routable protocol, is the protocol on
 which the Internet is built.
 q The NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI) is a transport protocol
 commonly found in smaller peer-to-peer networks.
 q NetBEUI is a nonroutable protocol.
 q AppleTalk is a routable protocol used in Macintosh environments.


 the osi Model
 q The Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model is a seven-layer model that
 defines the function of network protocols and devices.
 q The seven layers of the OSI model, from highest to lowest, are application,
 presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical.
 q SMTP, HTTP, Telnet, and FTP are all examples of application-layer (layer 7)
 protocols.
 q Compression and encryption are examples of functions that can be performed
 at the presentation layer (layer 6).
 q The session layer (layer 5) is responsible for the creation of sessions and the
 management of those sessions.
 q The transport layer (layer 4) is responsible for the reliability of the transmis-
 sion, including breaking the data down into manageable packets and sizes
 using acknowledgments and packet sequence numbers to ensure that data ar-
 rives at the destination and is pieced together in the correct order. Examples
 of layer-4 protocols are TCP, UDP, and SPX.
 q Layer 3, known as the network layer, performs logical addressing and delivery
 functions. Examples of layer-3 protocols are IP and IPX. Two-Minute Drill 107


 q The data link layer, layer 2, is responsible for physical addressing and con-
 verting the packets to electrical signals. Any device that works with MAC
 addresses runs at this layer.
 q The first layer of the OSI model, located at the bottom, is known as the
 physical layer and is responsible for carrying the signal. Your network media
 and architectures are defined at this level.
 q An IP address is known as a layer-3 address and looks similar to 192.168.45.6.
 q A MAC address is known as a layer-2 address and looks similar to 00-02-3F-
 6B-25-13.
 q A port address is known as a layer-4 address and looks similar to 80 (web
 server port).

802 Project standards
 q The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has created
 project groups that define networking standards.
 q 802.3 is the Ethernet (CSMA/CD) standard.
 q 802.5 defines the Token Ring standard.
 q 802.11 defines the wireless standard. 108 Chapter 2: Network Protocols and Standards

 by Apple, and TCP/IP is the protocol of the Internet.
 6. þ D. The AppleTalk protocol configures hosts into zones.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, and NetBEUI do not use zones to organize
 nodes on the network.
 7. þ B. Using IPX/SPX and having trouble connecting to some of the servers on the network
 but not others is a classic description of a communication problem, indicating that the client
 has the frame type set to something different from that used by the servers. You will need to
 verify the frame type on all systems and ensure that systems that wish to talk to one another are
 configured with the same frame type.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because IP addresses have nothing to do with the
 IPX/SPX protocol. C and D are incorrect because both are describing issues that would arise
 when connecting to “any” server. In our example, the client can connect to some servers, so the
 client software and the network card driver must already be loaded. Self Test Answers 113

 I n this chapter, you will learn about popular networking components found in a LAN
 environment, such as network cards, hubs, switches, routers, and other network devices. This
 chapter is a critical chapter not only for the Network+ exam but also for the real world. Be
 sure to take your time and understand all the concepts presented in this chapter.




CertifiCation objeCtive 3.01


network interface Cards
 The network interface card (NIC), or network card, is a device installed on the system
 that is responsible for sending and receiving data onto the network. The network
 card is responsible for preparing data from the system to be transported on the wire
 by converting the outbound data from a parallel format (due to bus width of the bus
 architecture that the card is sitting in) to electrical signals that will travel along the
 network media. On the receiving end, the network card is responsible for receiving
 the electrical signal and converting it to data that is understood by the system.
 The network card also is known as a network adapter; it can be installed in the
 system after the system has been purchased, or the system comes with a network
 card built in. A system that comes with a network card built in is said to have an
 integrated network card—meaning the card is integrated into the system. Figure 3-1
 shows an integrated network card port on the side of a laptop; desktop computers
 typically have the port on the back of the computer.

An ISA network
interface card




 Network cards that are installed on the computer as an add-on can be installed
 into the system by inserting the card into the expansion bus of the system (usually
 PCI, but in the past it was ISA) or by plugging
 in a USB device. There are a number of
 different types of expansion slots in the system.
 It is very important that When installing a network card, you will need
 you know these types of slots and their to make sure that you get the correct type of
 abilities as far as the bus width (measured card for the particular type of expansion slot.
 in bits) and speed the slot can handle. In For example, a PCI card is placed in a PCI slot
 addition, network cards run at layer 1 and and will not fit into an ISA or AGP slot. The
 layer 2 of the OSI model. following is a list of popular expansion bus
 architectures, and Figure 3-2 shows a picture
 of an ISA network interface card.

 n ISA Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is an old bus architecture that
 runs at 8 MHz and supports 8- or 16-bit cards.
 n MCA Microchannel Architecture (MCA) was built by IBM and has a
 32-bit architecture that runs at 10 MHz.
 n VESA Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA, also known as
 VESA local bus, or VLB) at the time ran at the system speed (which was
 around 33 MHz); it has a 32-bit architecture.
 n EISA Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) is the upgrade to
 ISA that supports 32-bit cards running at 8 MHz. 118 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 n PCI Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is the popular bus
 architecture today for adding cards to the system. PCI runs at 33 MHz and
 has a 32-bit or 64-bit bus architecture. Most network cards today are PCI.
 n AGP Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) is the new graphics standard that
 runs at 66 MHz and is used by video cards.
 n PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association
 (PCMCIA) is the bus architecture used in laptop computers. PCMCIA has
 a 16-bit architecture that runs at 33 MHz.



transceivers
 A transceiver is that portion of the network interface that actually transmits and
 receives electrical signals across the transmission media. When the signal is traveling
 along the length of the wire, the transceiver picks the signal up and verifies that the
 data is destined for the local system. If the data is destined for the local system, the
 data is passed up to the system for processing; if it is not, it is discarded. There are
 two types of transceivers: onboard and external.

 onboard transceivers
 Onboard transceivers are built onto the network interface card. With these
 transceivers, the media connector is built right on the back of the NIC. Common
 examples of this type include RJ-45 receptacles for twisted-pair cable and BNC
 connectors for thinnet coaxial cable (shown in Figure 3-3).


 figure 3-3

RJ-45 and
BNC onboard
transceivers on a
network card Network Interface Cards 119


 external transceivers
 With an external transceiver, the actual media connection is made external to the
 network card using a small device that attaches to the NIC via an extension cable.
 These connections use an attachment unit interface (AUI) connector, also called
 a Digital-Intel-Xerox (DIX) connector, on the back of the network card. The AUI
 connector is a female 15-pin D-connector (shown in Figure 3-4) that looks very much
 like a joystick port and typically is used to connect a workstation to thicknet cabling.
 The types of transceivers and media that can be served by a NIC determine the
 appropriate connector. Each media type has a typical connector type or connection
 method.

 thicknet Coax
 Thicknet, or standard Ethernet coax, uses a connection method that typically involves
 an external transceiver connected to the adapter’s AUI port. This external transceiver
 has a connection called a vampire tap that attaches to the media by drilling a hole
 in the cable using a special drilling jig that controls the depth of the hole. This jig
 prevents the drill from drilling through and severing the center conductor.
 The vampire tap consists of a pin that is inserted into the hole drilled in the cable
 and a clamp that holds the tap onto the cable. One of the challenges of this type of
 connection is to position the tap so that it contacts the center conductor without
 shorting to the shield surrounding it. These difficulties, as well as the cost and size of
 thicknet cable, have rendered it largely obsolete, although it occasionally could be
 found in existing installations.


 figure 3-4

connector on the

switch 120 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 thinnet Coax
 Thinnet coax can be attached directly to a network adapter if an onboard
 transceiver is used. In this case, a connector called a barrel connector (BNC) on
 the network card attaches to a T-connector. The T-connector has a female fitting
 that attaches to the card, as well as two additional male fittings that attach to cable
 segments or a terminator.
 Each end of a thinnet Ethernet segment must be terminated, so the last node on
 each end could have a terminator attached to the side of the T-connector opposite
 the inbound cable. All other nodes use T-connectors with cable segments attached
 to both sides, just like holiday tree lights. A thinnet segment cannot be attached
 directly to the BNC connector on the network adapter; it must use a T-connector.

 twisted-Pair Wiring
 The typical connector for a twisted-pair connection is called an RJ-45 connector.
 The RJ-45 connector looks like an oversized phone connector. The reason for the
 difference in size is that a phone connector (RJ-11) has a four-wire connector,
 whereas an RJ-45 connector is an eight-wire connector.
 An RJ-45 patch cable can be plugged directly into the back of the network
 adapter. The patch cable usually runs to a wall receptacle, which is wired back to a
 patch panel and ultimately back to a wiring hub.

 fiber-optic Cabling
 Fiber-optic adapters generally have two connectors, one each for incoming and
 outgoing fiber cables. The mechanical connectors that join the cable, called ST
 connectors, are designed to pass light seamlessly across the joined fiber segments.
 For this reason, these connectors must be made with great precision. Fiber-optic runs
 generally are made back to a concentrator that performs a hub function.
 In many situations, fiber-optic cabling is used to connect high-speed computers
 and provide a high-speed backbone to which slower LANs are attached. The LANs
 might connect copper media, such as twisted-pair or coaxial cable, to a set of hubs
 that are then bridged to the fiber-optic backbone for high-speed data transfer
 between LANs.

 transceiver Configuration
 A number of network cards have multiple types of connectors on the back of the
 card (called combo cards in this case) to allow you to use different types of cabling Network Interface Cards 121


 to connect the system to the network. The transceiver type that is being used by
 the network card is typically set to the “auto” setting, which means that the card
 can sense which transceiver you are using and the card will configure itself to use
 that transceiver. When troubleshooting to find out why the card is not working,
 the “auto setting” is the first thing you should change. When I have problems
 connecting to a network, I usually change the transceiver setting to the actual
 one I am using. For example, if you are using the RJ-45 connector you will want
 to change the setting to something like TP (for twisted-pair) or TX as shown in
 Figure 3-5. During configuration, the different transceivers can be referred to in the
 following ways:

 n DIX or AUI The card uses an external thicknet transceiver.
 n Coax, 10Base2, or BNC The card has an onboard thinnet Ethernet
 connector known as a BNC connector.
 n TP, TX, UTP, 10BaseT, or 100BaseT The card has an onboard RJ-45
 connector.

 Another setting that I normally have no problem with but have had trouble
 with recently is the transfer rate of the network card. A number of today’s network
 cards support 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and even 1000 Mbps. Most of the time these


 figure 3-5

Changing the
transceiver type
through the
network card
properties 122 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 network cards are set to “auto” in order to detect the speed at which the card will
 run—the card derives its speed from the device it is connected to. For example, if
 you have a 10/100 Mbps network card but plug it into a 10 Mbps hub, it will run at
 10 Mbps—not the full 100 Mbps, because the card detects the speed of the device it
 is connected to.
 Recently, I had a problem when the network card was not able to autoconfigure
 itself. After troubleshooting for a little bit, I went to the network card properties and
 forced the speed of the network card to 100 Mbps (shown in Figure 3-6)—and voilà!
 It worked beautifully.
 Another setting you may want to configure on your network card is the
 transmission method of either simplex, half duplex, or full duplex. The three
 transmission methods are as follows:

 n Simplex Allows communication in one direction only. You will only be able
 to send or receive with a simplex device—not both directions. It is either one
 way or the other.
 n Half duplex Allows communication in both directions (send and receive),
 but not at the same time. A network card set to half duplex will not be able
 to receive data while sending data. Using the half-duplex setting can slow
 down communication if your device does support full duplex.
 n Full duplex Allows communication in both directions at the same time. If
 a network card supports full duplex, it will be able to receive data when data
 is being sent because all four pairs of wires are used. If you make sure that a
 network card that supports full duplex is set to full duplex, you will notice a
 big difference in throughput if the device is set to half duplex.

 Most network cards are set to auto. With this
 setting, you may want to force the setting to the
 full-duplex mode to be sure that you are getting

MaC address
 Each network card has a unique address that is burned into the card by its
 manufacturer. This unique address, known as a MAC address, is used in the header
 of the packet for the source and destination addresses of the packet. The MAC
 address is a 48-bit address displayed in a hexadecimal format that looks similar to
 00-90-4B-4C-C1-59 or sometimes 00:90:4B:4C:C1:59.
 The MAC address is made up of
 12 characters and is in hexadecimal format.
 The first half of the MAC address is the
 manufacturer’s address, while the last half

 To view your MAC address on your system
 in Windows 2000/XP/2003, you can go to a
 command prompt and type ipconfig /all. You
 will notice the MAC address of the network card listed within the output as the
 physical address. To view your MAC address in Linux, go to a terminal prompt
 and type ifconfig to view your MAC address. Exercise 3-2 demonstrates how
 to view your MAC address and then how to use the Internet to determine the
 manufacturer of the network card by using the first six characters of the MAC
 address.

troubleshooting network Cards
 Along with installing and configuring the network card, you should be familiar with
 some common steps involved in troubleshooting connectivity issues with a network
 card. When problems arise in connecting to the network, one of the first things you
 want to do is check to see that the “link” light is on at the back of the network card.
 If the link light is on, you may want to make sure that there is activity by looking 128 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 at the activity light. The activity light should be blinking when there is network
 activity. If these lights are not on, you will need to reconfigure the cards or replace
 them if reconfiguration doesn’t work. You also may want to try updating the driver
 for the network card if you are having problems with the device.

 testing
 If there is one thing you will do often, it is testing to be sure any updates or changes
 you made are working properly. Once your network card has been installed, you
 have to connect the cable to it. Some network cards have multiple transceivers
 on them. You must connect the appropriate cable for the network into the correct
 transceiver type.
 Once the cable has been connected, you can check a couple of things to see
 whether the card is operating properly. The first of these is the link light on the back
 of the card. Some older network cards do not have this feature, but newer ones do.
 You should see a light next to the transceiver. Some 10 Mbps cards have an activity
 light and a connection light. Some 10/100 Mbps cards have both a 10 Mbps light
 and a 100 Mbps light along with the activity light, which tells you the speed at
 which you are connected.
 Once you have verified that the link light is on, which proves to you that there
 is a physical connection, the next thing you need to do is troubleshoot connectivity
 issues. Most networks run TCP/IP, so you will likely start pinging addresses on the
 network. For more troubleshooting tips on TCP/IP, refer to Chapter 6.

 network Card Diagnostics
 Another direction to take when troubleshooting the network card is to use a
 diagnostic program to run a series of tests on the network adapter. You can use
 generic diagnostic programs or vendor-supplied diagnostics. Many diagnostics must
 be run without the network drivers loaded, so you may need to boot the operating
 system to Safe mode first. Figure 3-9 shows a diagnostic and testing program for
 an Acer card. Diagnostic programs run a variety of tests on the hardware of the
 card, including the transceiver, and also perform a communication test (such as a
 loopback test).

 Loopback test The loopback test is one that tests communication in and out of
 the card. A stream of data is sent out and loops back around into the card. The input
 is then compared to see whether the data received is the same as that sent. Network Interface Cards 129

diagnostics
program




 Some cards can run an internal loopback test as a method of troubleshooting
 communication problems. Others must have a loopback adapter that plugs into the
 card. This way, the data actually is sent out of the card and loops around and comes
 back into the card as though it were received from another device. Sometimes this is
 a more accurate and realistic test of the card.

 Drivers
 When you install a network card on a Windows system, Plug and Play recognizes
 and configures the hardware by loading the appropriate driver. A driver is a piece of
 software that enables the operating system to communicate with the device. There
 are different types of drivers for modems, sound cards, and just about any other
 component in a computer.
 The manufacturer provides the driver, and usually the driver has its own
 configuration program to set up and install the network adapter. This is usually a
 SETUP.EXE, INSTALL.EXE, or INSTALL.BAT file. If this isn’t the case, and Plug
 and Play finds the network adapter but no default driver exists, you will have the
 opportunity to change the driver in Device Manager. If a driver needs updating in
 Device Manager, it will show with an Unknown Device icon (yellow question mark)
 in Device Manager, as shown in Figure 3-10. 130 Chapter 3: Networking Components

 From time to time, you might want to update the drivers for your various devices.
 Manufacturers update their drivers if problems are found in current versions. You
 can update the driver for your network card through Device Manager with Windows
 operating systems. Once in Device Manager, you will need to locate the device and
 then right-click and choose Update Driver, as shown in Figure 3-11. Once you choose
 the update driver command, you will need to browse to the location of the driver file.

Hubs, Maus, and repeaters
 Once you have the network card inserted into the computer system or network
 device, you will next need to connect each of the systems together using devices
 such as hubs, repeaters, or MAUs. You will need to be familiar with each of these
 networking devices for the Network+ exam, as well as being familiar with the layers
 of the OSI model that these devices run at.


Hubs
 Hubs are one of the most important components of a network because they act as
 a central point for all network devices to connect to. You can easily remember the
 layout of a hub if you think of a wheel and picture how the spokes radiate out from
 the hub of the wheel. In a network, each spoke is a connection, and the hub of the
 wheel is the hub of the network where all of the cables come together.

 the role of Hubs in networking
 The hub, also known as a concentrator, is responsible for allowing all systems a
 central point of connection, so that when a computer sends a piece of data to
 another computer, the electrical signal leaves the network card of the sending system
 and reaches the hub, and the hub sends the signal to all ports on the hub so that all
 systems can check to see whether the data is destined for them. Figure 3-12 shows an
 example of a five-port hub.


 figure 3-12

A five-port hub
used to connect
systems together 132 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 When looking at Figure 3-12, you will notice that the hub displays link lights
 for each port on the hub that is active. This can be used in troubleshooting, just
 like the link light on the back of a network card. You also will notice that there
 is a collision indicator on the hub, which indicates whether or not your network
 currently is having a lot of collisions. Once again, this could be very useful when
 troubleshooting network problems—excessive collisions could lead to systems
 dropping off the network.

 Cascading Hubs
 Looking at Figure 3-13, you will notice that there is a switch on the hub to
 indicate that you wish to use the fifth port to cascade, or connect, to another
 hub. If you were to try to chain two hubs together with the switch set to normal,
 it would be similar to trying to connect two computers together with a straight-
 through cable; it can’t be done because you need to switch the send and receive
 wires on one end of the cable. We have discussed using a crossover cable, but
 manufacturers of hubs have given us a solution that eliminates the need for
 crossover cables by creating a port on the hub that is already crossed over; you
 simply need to switch the setting to use the fifth port as the cascade port. Also
 known as the uplink port, the cascade port connects to a normal port on the
 next hub.
 If you wanted to connect three 24-port hubs together, you would need to uplink
 from port 24 on the first hub to any port on the second hub (I usually uplink to the
 first port on the second hub), then use port 24 on the second hub to uplink to the
 first port on the third hub, as shown in Figure 3-14.

 Before we get into the different types of hubs, a point that I want to stress (one
 that was mentioned earlier) is that a hub sends the signal to all ports on the hub.
 This means that, if you have a 24-port hub linked to another 24-port hub and a
 workstation sends data to another workstation, the data will be sent to all 48 ports
 on the network. This leads to a lot of unneeded traffic and contention across the
 entire network that will slow network performance. A solution would be to use a
 switch, which is the subject of an upcoming discussion!

 Passive Hubs
 The function of a passive hub is simply to receive data from one port of the hub and
 send it out to the other ports. For example, an eight-port hub receives data from port
 3 and then resends that data to ports 1, 2, 4, 5,
 6, 7, and 8.
 A passive hub contains no power source
 or electrical components, there is no signal
 For the exam, remember processing (such as when the hub receives the

 signal is a function of an active hub!

 active Hubs
 An active hub provides the same functionality as a passive hub with an additional
 feature. Active hubs rebuild (regenerate) the data before sending it to all of the
 destination ports on the hub. Using active hubs, you can increase the length of your 134 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 network, because although the signal weakens with distance, when the active hub
 receives the signal, it rebuilds the data, allowing it once more to go a greater
 distance. It is important to remember that UTP
 cabling can be run a maximum of 100 meters.
 With an active hub, you can run this type of

 Hybrid Hubs
 A hybrid hub is a hub that can use many
 different types of cables in addition to UTP
 cabling. A hybrid hub usually is cabled
 Hubs are used in Ethernet using thinnet or thicknet Ethernet along
 environments, whereas Token Ring with popular cable types such as twisted-pair
 environments use MAUs. Also know that cabling. A few years ago, hybrid hubs were

 as well. Figure 3-15 displays a hybrid hub.

Multistation access units
 A multistation access unit (MAU) is a device to which multiple workstations are
 connected in order to communicate on a Token Ring network. A MAU is a hub-type
 device for Token Ring networks with some features that make it a little bit different
 from a hub—for example, a MAU regenerates the signal when it reaches the MAU.
 Because Token Ring networks use token
 passing instead of CSMA/CD, there is no
 chance for collisions on a Token Ring network.
 The first difference you will notice with MAUs
 Remember that the over hubs is that a MAU does not have collision
 MAU allows for a physical star topology indicators on it because you can’t have collisions
 but is logically a ring topology because on a Token Ring network. Figure 3-16 shows
 it cycles through all ports in order to a picture of a MAU; notice that there are no
 simulate a ring. collision indicators on the device.
 Another major difference with a MAU is
 that MAUs don’t actually use an uplink port.
 With Token Ring, there is a logical ring within the MAU, and when you connect
 to another MAU, you must complete a full ring structure again. Therefore, you will
 notice on the Token Ring MAU that it has a ring-in port and a ring-out port. When
 you wish to connect two MAUs together, you must ring out of the first MAU and,
 with that cable, ring in to the second MAU. Then you must ring out of the second
 MAU and ring in to the first MAU, as shown in Figure 3-17.


repeaters
 One of the pitfalls of networking environments is that the electrical signal that
 is traveling the wire is weakened over distance as a result of outside interference.
 Eventually, if two systems are too far from one another, the signal is so weak that by
 the time it reaches the other side it is unreadable. This is where repeaters come in.

 If your network layout exceeds the normal
 specifications of the cable, you can use repeaters
 to allow the signal to travel the distance by

 185 m. But what if you want to connect two
 systems together that are 235 m apart? You would
 place a repeater somewhere before the 185 m mark so that the repeater will regenerate
 or rebuild the signal, allowing it to travel the extra difference. Figure 3-18 shows a
 signal that is weakened over distance but is regenerated through the use of a repeater.

bridges and switches
 Now that we have discussed some of the popular layer-1 devices, let’s take a look at
 some popular layer-2 devices. Layer-2 devices are a little smarter than layer-1 devices
 in the sense that they actually can make decisions about where the electrical signal
 needs to go. Remember that a hub, which is a layer-1 device, would forward the
 signal to all ports on the hub, which will lead to traffic problems as you start adding
 hubs to the topology.
 This section will introduce you to two layer-2 devices that often are used to filter
 network traffic. By filtering network traffic, we are conserving precious bandwidth
 on the network, which will have a huge impact on the overall performance of the
 network.


bridges
 A bridge is a network connectivity device that is used to break the network down
 into multiple network segments. A bridge runs at layer 2, the data link layer, and is
 used to filter traffic by only forwarding traffic to the destination network segment.
 Figure 3-19 shows an example of a bridged network.

 Let’s look at an example of how a bridge filters network traffic. Assume that
 you have just completed connecting the bridge to the network segments shown in
 Figure 3-19. When Workstation A sends data to Workstation F, the data will go
 out the network card of Workstation A and will travel the full length of segment 3
 in both directions. The signal will reach the bridge, and the bridge will look at the
 destination MAC address of the packet. Once the bridge looks at the destination
 MAC address, it will compare that MAC address with the MAC addresses in its
 bridging table. The bridging table is a table in memory that lists all known MAC
 addresses and which network segment that MAC address lives on. This table is
 critical to the bridge’s filtering features. Since this is the first piece of data sent on
 the network, the MAC address for Workstation F is not in the bridging table, so the
 bridge will need to forward the data to both segment 1 and segment 2. It will not
 forward the information to network segment 3 because that is where the data came
 from, and if Workstation F existed on that network, it would already have the data.
 When the bridge received the initial data from Workstation A, it recorded
 the MAC address of Workstation A and the network segment that Workstation
 A resides on in the bridging table. This way if anyone sends data to Workstation
 A, the bridge will have an entry for Workstation A in the bridging table, and the
 bridge will forward the data only to network
 segment 3 and not to the other segments.
 Also note that when Workstation F replies
 to Workstation A, the data will need to pass
 through the bridge, so the bridge will know

 with a MAC address, and the MAC is a

 bridging table.
 the bridge runs at layer 2 of the OSI model
 Over time, the bridging table will be filled
 with MAC addresses and their associated
 network segments. In our example, after the bridging table has been constructed,
 if Workstation A sends data to Workstation C, the data will reach the bridge and
 the bridge will forward the data only to network segment 1. This prevents network
 segment 2 from being congested with the traffic (shown in Figure 3-20).


switches
 Switches, also known as switching hubs, have become an increasingly important
 part of our networking today, because when working with hubs, a hub sends the data
 to all ports on the hub. If you have a large network structure, this means that you Bridges and Switches 139

 have probably linked a few hubs together, and when data is sent from one system to
 another, all computers see the traffic. This leads to a lot of network traffic, which
 eventually slows network performance. Figure 3-21 shows an example of a 24-port
 10/100 Mbps switch.
 When you use a switch instead of a hub, the switch acts as a filtering device by
 associating the MAC address of the system connected to the switch with the port on
 the switch that the system is connected to. For example, in Figure 3-22, Computer
 A transmits a packet to Computer C. The packet enters the switch from port 1 and
 then travels a direct route to port 3, because the switch uses the destination MAC
 address of the packet and knows that the MAC address is of the device connected

 into port 3. From port 3, the packet is transmitted to Computer C. During this
 process, Computer B is unaware of the traffic between Computers A and C, because
 there is a direct path within the switch and no shared bandwidth.

 It is a best practice to use switches whenever possible because of the increase
 in performance over a standard hub.The bandwidth with a standard hub is
 shared by all users connected to the hub; however, with a switch, all users get
 the full network bandwidth. For example, a 100 Mbps network with a 24-port
 hub and 24 PCs allows each user to have 100/24 Mbps bandwidth; with a
 switch, however, each user would have a full 100 Mbps bandwidth.



 understanding vLans
 Virtual LANs (VLANs) are a feature of special switches, known as managed switches,
 which allow the administrator to group ports on a switch to a “virtual LAN.” When
 a port is configured for a particular VLAN, it is unable to communicate with systems
 that are not on that VLAN without the use of a routing device such as a router. This
 is similar to the fact that, if we had two physical networks, a machine cannot send
 data from one network to the other without the use of a router. Bridges and Switches 141


 The purpose of a VLAN is to cut down on broadcast traffic through the use of
what are known as broadcast domains. A VLAN acts as a broadcast domain—let’s
look at how this works. Normally, if we had a 24-port hub or switch and a computer
wanted to send data to all systems, it would “broadcast” the data out onto the
network. A broadcast will hit every port on that switch or hub. With a VLAN-
supported switch, you can create VLANs that act as “broadcast” domains. This
means that if Workstation A is on VLAN1, which is made up of ports 1 through
12 on the 24-port switch, when Workstation A sends broadcast traffic (traffic
intended for all systems), it will be sent only to ports 1 through 12 because the
virtual LAN is acting as a boundary for traffic. The benefit of this is that you are
now able to minimize traffic within or across switches, which increases network
throughput. Figure 3-23 shows a switch that is divided into two different VLANs.
 How you implement your VLAN depends on what type of switch you have. There
are a number of different types of switches:

 n Layer-1 switch A layer-1 switch implements what is known as port
 switching. Port switching means that the network administrator associates
 the ports on the switch as being members of a particular VLAN. With port
 switching, you need to ensure that you are satisfied with the fact that if
 you move a computer from one port to another, the system may become a
 member of a different VLAN, because the port is the member of the VLAN,
 not the network card connected to it. Layer-1 switches do offer benefits;
 they are great for increasing security and isolation. They also allow an
 administrator to move a system to a new VLAN by reconfiguring the port
 for the new VLAN. The benefit is that there is no need to move the system
 physically.
 n Layer-2 switch A layer-2 switch doesn’t associate the port with the VLAN,
 but the MAC addresses of systems are associated with the VLAN. The
 network administrator is responsible for listing all the MAC addresses for
 each VLAN on the switch. When a packet is sent by a system and reaches
 the switch, the switch tags the packet as being a member of the VLAN, and
 it will be sent only to other systems in the VLAN. The benefit of layer-2
 switches is that, because the MAC address is associated with the VLAN, it
 doesn’t matter what port the system is plugged into. This is a great feature for
 laptop users who typically roam around on the network—they will always be
 a member of the same VLAN unless the switch is reconfigured. 142 Chapter 3: Networking Components

 the network ID in them.

 To create the VLANs, the network administrator will need to run the
 configuration utility on the VLAN-supported switch. Also note that with a layer-1
 switch, if a system needs to be moved from VLAN1 to VLAN2, there is no need
 to move systems around; you simply need to configure the port that the system is
 connected to from one VLAN to the other on the switch.

 Now that you have an understanding of some of the more popular network com-
 ponents, let’s work through an exercise and think about how these devices are used.

 switch features
 Most enterprise-capable switches have a number of features that make the switch
 attractive for large organizations. The following is a listing of popular features
 incorporated into big-name switches such as those from Cisco and Juniper Networks.

 spanning tree Protocol (stP) The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) runs at layer
 2 and is designed to prevent loops on a network that could occur if you connect a
 number of switches together. For example, a loop is created if you connect Switch1
 to Switch2 and then turn around and connect Switch2 back to Switch1 using a dif-
 ferent cable and ports on the switches.
 Having a loop on the network could cause the network to go down and creates
 instability in the switches. To prevent this, STP was designed. STP is a protocol that
 looks at all of the ports used to create a loop and then places one of those ports in a
 blocking state so that no data traffic can pass through the port. Once the port is in a
 blocking state, the loop is broken and the network becomes more stable.
 The fact that the port is in a blocking state instead of being disabled means that if
 one of the other links go down, then the port is transitioned into a forwarding state
 automatically. When a port is in a forwarding state, it is allowed to send and receive
 data on the port.

 trunking Trunking is a feature on Cisco switches that allows you to connect the
 switches together and then assign one of the ports as a trunk port. The trunk port is
 the port that is used to carry VLAN traffic to the other switch. VLANs are allowed
 to contain ports as members that are from multiple switches. If data is destined for
 all systems in the VLAN, the VLAN identification information is added to the data
 packet and then the switch sends the packet out the trunk port. When another
 switch receives the packet, it checks the VLAN identification information and then
 sends the data to all of its ports that are a member of that particular VLAN.

 isL and 802.1Q When a switch assigns the VLAN identification information to
 a packet, this is known as tagging. Two popular protocols for tagging are the Inter-
 Switch Link (ISL) and the IEEE 802.1Q protocol.
 ISL is the Cisco proprietary protocol for tagging packets and associating them
 with a particular VLAN on older switches, while 802.1Q is the IEEE standard for
 VLAN trunking. Newer Cisco and Juniper Networks switches use 802.1Q as the
 tagging method. 144 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 Port Mirroring Port mirroring, also known as port monitoring, is a feature that
 allows the switch to send a copy of data that reaches certain ports to the mirrored, or
 monitored, port. Port monitoring allows an administrator to plug his/her workstation
 into the port that the copy of the data is being sent to, and monitor the network
 traffic.
 Port mirroring is an important feature of a switch because by default the switch
 filters traffic by only sending the data to the port that the destination system resides
 on. The switch’s filtering feature will prevent the monitoring of traffic, and as a
 result the administrator will have to enable port mirroring (monitoring) and specify
 the port that receives the copy of data.

 Port authentication Port authentication is another important feature of the
 switch that allows the administrator to associate the MAC address of the system that
 will connect to the port. The administrator can also specify that if a system with a
 different MAC address connects to the port, the port is to be automatically disabled.
 Port authentication will help increase the security of the network by allowing
 only authorized systems to connect to the network—a critical feature of any switch!

 Content switch A content switch is a special switch that is designed for optimiz-
 ing data delivery to clients by incorporating features to improve performance such
 as data caching or load balancing features on the switch. Here is an example of how
 the switch can load-balance traffic: if you connect two servers into the switch, the
 switch creates a virtual server using a virtual IP, and when a request comes in to the
 virtual IP, the switch then forwards the request to one of the servers connected to
 the switch. The result is that the load is balanced across both servers and perfor-
 mance is increased.

routers and brouters
 One of the most popular network devices along with a switch is a network router. A
 router is responsible for sending data from one network to another and is a layer-3
 device. This section will introduce you to routers and brouters. Routers and Brouters 145


routers
 Routers are layer-3 devices and are responsible for routing, or sending data from one
 network to another. A router will have multiple network interfaces, as shown in
 Figure 3-24, with each network connecting to a network or a WAN environment.
 Routers are typically used to connect the LAN to a WAN environment by having
 a network interface and a WAN interface connecting to each type of network. The
 router then passes data from one interface to the other.
 Routers work with layer-3 addresses, which
 are logical addresses assigned to the systems
 that are used to determine how to reach the
 destination network. Routers use a routing table
 In order for data to stored in memory on the router to determine
 leave the network, the systems must use how to reach a system on a destination network.
 routable protocols, such as IPX/SPX,TCP/ Figure 3-25 shows three networks connected by
 IP, or AppleTalk. routers. In the figure, notice that if a system on
 Network A wants to send data to a system on
 Network B, it must leave Network A by means
 of Router 1 and then Router 1 will send the data to Router 2. It is the responsibility
 of Router 2 to send the data to the destination computer.
 Routers are a great way to filter network traffic as well, because they act as a
 broadcast domain. Traffic will not cross the router unless it is actually destined for a
 system on the remote network. Most router administrators do not allow broadcasts
 to pass through the router.
 For more information on how routers work and how to manage them, be sure to
 check out Chapter 5.

Brouters
 A number of network environments use multiple network protocols on the network
 to support different network applications or services. If you need to route data for
 one protocol but need the bridging functionality for another protocol, instead
 of buying both a bridge and a router, you can purchase a brouter. A brouter is the
 combination of a bridge and a router, and it makes the decision whether it needs
 to bridge the data or route the data according to the protocol being used. If the
 protocol is a nonroutable protocol such as NetBEUI, the data will be bridged. If the
 protocol is TCP/IP or IPX/SPX, the routing features of the brouter will be used. Gateways and Security Devices 147

 A gateway is responsible for translating information from one format to another and
 can run at any layer of the OSI model, depending on what information the gateway
 translates. A typical use of a gateway is to ensure that systems in one environment
 can access information in another environment. For example, you want to make
 sure that your PC environment can access information on the company’s mainframe.
 As shown in Figure 3-26, when the packet reaches the gateway, the gateway strips
 the packet down and repackages it so that it is understood on the other side of the
 gateway.
 In Figure 3-26, notice that the information sent by Workstation 1 has been
 reformatted after reaching the gateway. Gateways do this by stripping the packet
 down to just the data and then rebuilding the packet so that it is understood at the
 destination.

 It is also important to note that when you configure TCP/IP and you configure
 the “default gateway” setting, you are pointing to the address of the router on the
 network. It really has nothing to do with an actual “gateway” device.


firewalls
 Firewalls are a networking component responsible for protecting the network
 from outside intruders. The firewall is designed to block specific types of traffic
 while allowing certain information to pass through. For example, I have a firewall
 that blocks any data that tries to reach my network from the Internet unless it is
 HTTP traffic. The reason I have allowed HTTP traffic through the firewall is that
 I would like my customers to be able to view my web site. The firewall administrator
 selectively chooses which traffic can and cannot pass through the firewall.
 For more information on firewalls, refer to Chapter 12.

 The home router you purchase for home or a small office has firewall features
 built in. I would highly recommend one to protect your systems from the
 Internet.To make sure that your computer is not connected directly into the
 Internet, put one of these devices between you and the outside world!



intrusion Detection systems
 An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security device that monitors system or
 network activity and then notifies the administrator of any suspicious activity.
 Intrusion detection systems are important devices that will complement other
 security devices such as firewalls. The IDS is an important device because it will
 notify you not only of suspicious activity against the firewall, but also of suspicious
 activity inside the network.
 There are two types of intrusion detection systems:

 n Host based Host-based intrusion detection systems monitor the local
 system for suspicious activity. A host-based IDS is typically a piece of software
 installed on the system and can only monitor activity on the system the IDS
 was installed on.
 n Network based A network-based IDS monitors network traffic for
 suspicious behavior. A network-based IDS has the capability of monitoring
 the entire network and comparing that traffic to known malicious traffic Other Networking Devices 149


 patterns. When a match is found an alert can be triggered. Network-based
 IDSs can be software loaded on a system that monitors network traffic or can
 be a hardware device.

 Intrusion detection systems can be either active or passive. An active IDS will
 monitor activity, log any suspicious activity, and then take some form of corrective
 action. For example, if a system is doing a port scan on the network, the IDS may log
 the activity but also disconnect the system creating the suspicious action from the
 network.
 A passive intrusion detection system does not take any corrective action when
 suspicious activity has been identified. The passive IDS will simply identify the
 activity and then log to file any information needed during an investigation. The
 passive IDS does not take any corrective action.
 For more information on intrusion detection systems, see Chapter 12.

other networking Devices
 There are a few additional devices that you should be familiar with for the Network+
 exam. These are devices that will connect you to a wireless network or a WAN
 environment. These devices are only quickly mentioned here because they appear
 again in the chapters on WAN and remote connectivity.


Wireless access Points
 Wireless access points (WAPs) are network devices that can be connected to the
 wired network to allow a wireless client to pass through to get access to the
 wired network and its resources. A wireless access point also is known as a cell,
 which is a device that transmits and receives radio frequencies between the PCs
 and network devices with wireless transmitters connected to them. The wireless
 access point is connected to a physical cable, which connects the WAP device to
 the rest of the network. Figure 3-27 shows an example of a Linksys home router
 that is a wireless access point as well. Notice the wireless antennas attached to
 the access point. 150 Chapter 3: Networking Components

 The typical home router is a multifunctional device; it acts as a wireless access
 point, firewall, switch, and router, all wrapped up in one device.


Modems
 There are other forms of networking devices beyond the typical network card; for
 instance, modems can be used to communicate with other systems across the public
 switched telephone network (PSTN). They are used to convert digital data from
 the PC to analog transmission so that the information can be transmitted over the
 analog phone lines. The modem on the receiving end is designed to convert the
 analog signal to a digital format readable by the system. For more information on
 modems, see Chapter 8.


Csu/Dsu
 A channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU) is either one device or a pair of
 devices that allows an organization to get a very-high-speed WAN connection from
 the telephone company, such as a T1 or T3 link. The CSU is used at the business
 end to get the connection to the WAN, and the DSU may be used at the provider’s
 end to allow the CSU to connect. For more information on WAN technologies and
 CSU/DSUs, see Chapter 9. Other Networking Devices 151


isDn
 The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a communication standard for
 sending voice and data over normal telephone lines or digital telephone lines. In
 order to connect to the ISDN lines, a system will need an ISDN modem, which
 doesn’t really act like a modem because, whereas a modem converts digital data to
 analog, the ISDN modem carries digital data from one digital system to another, and
 so it really is acting as a terminal adapter connecting you to the ISDN lines.
 There are two popular types of ISDN connections:

 n Basic rate interface (BRI) This is a
 128 Kbps connection that is made up of two
 64 Kbps channels (known as B-channels)
 and one 16 Kbps control channel (known as
 Be sure to be familiar with a D-channel).
 BRI and PRI ISDN connections. You will be n Primary rate interface (PRI) This is
 tested on them for the Network+ exam. a 1.55 Mbps connection that is made
 up of twenty-three 64 Kbps channels
 (B-channels) and one 64 Kbps D-channel
 for signaling and control information.



Wiring Distribution
 This chapter wouldn’t be complete without a discussion of how the cabling for the
 network is configured. In Chapter 1 you learned about the different types of cables,
 and this section will identify related terms you need to know for the exam that
 surround cabling as a topic.

 Plenum vs. nonplenum
 For the Network+ exam you need to be familiar with the term plenum. Plenum refers
 to the space between the ceiling tiles and the floor located above them. This space
 is typically used to route power and network cables. It is important to use plenum-
 grade cables in this space because if there is a fire and you are not using plenum-
 grade cables, a toxin is given off that could be carried throughout the building,
 causing harm to individuals. Plenum-grade cabling uses a low-toxicity material for
 the jacket of the cable in case of fire. 152 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 Patch Panel
 Most companies have network jacks located in the walls that allow systems to
 connect to the network. These jacks have cables connected to them that are then
 routed a long distance to a patch panel in a
 server room.
 The patch panel then has a patch cable that
 connects to the front of the patch panel and a
 Cables are typically port on a switch. When a computer connects

 patch panel.

 Cross Connects, MDf, and iDf
 When wiring the network you will typically have the outside line coming into
 the building connect to a panel; this panel is known as the main distribution frame,
 or MDF. From the MDF you would typically connect to other panels, known as
 intermediate distribution frames (IDFs), which is what the workstations connect to.
 This hierarchy of MDF and IDF panels allows greater flexibility when rearranging
 the network at a later time.

 A typical example of how the MDF and IDFs are used is that the MDF would
 connect to the cable coming from outside the building. Then there may be a
 separate IDF panel representing each floor in the building, with the workstations
 on a particular floor connecting to the panel associated with that floor.

CertifiCation suMMarY
 In this chapter, you learned about some of the popular networking devices that are
 used on networks to allow systems to communicate on the network. The first of
 those devices is the network card. The network card is responsible for converting
 parallel data that is transmitted through the computer’s bus to a serial bit stream to
 be sent on the wire. The network card uses a transceiver. Transceivers constitute
 that portion of the network interface that actually transmits and receives electrical
 signals across the transmission media and connects to the media. There are two types
 of transceivers: built in and external. The NIC usually has a built-in transceiver for
 twisted-pair and thinnet, but thicknet typically uses an external transceiver.
 The network card uses the MAC address burned into the card by the
 manufacturer as an identifier to determine where the packet is destined and where it
 came from. The system does this by adding the source MAC address and destination
 MAC address to the packet, which is read by networking devices to determine
 where the packet needs to go.
 There are a few popular layer-1 devices, such as hubs, repeaters, and MAUs.
 Remember that these devices are considered layer 1 because they work with the
 electrical signals. Any data that reaches a layer-1 device will be sent to all ports on
 the device. A repeater is responsible for regenerating the electrical signal so that the
 signal may travel a greater distance. A MAU is used in a Token Ring environment
 and regenerates the signal with each system connected to the MAU. When
 connecting MAUs, you will need to ring out of one MAU and ring in to the second 154 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 MAU; you will then ring out of the second MAU and ring in to the third MAU.
 Remember to ring out of the last one and ring in to the first MAU.
 Bridges and switches are examples of layer-2 devices. A bridge is responsible for
 filtering network traffic by sending the data only to the network segment where
 the destination system resides. The bridge builds a bridging table, which has a list
 of destinations. A switch has replaced the network hub nowadays, and it filters
 traffic by sending data only to the port on the switch where the destination system
 is connected. You can increase network performance dramatically by changing
 your network hubs to switches. A number of switches support VLAN capabilities.
 A VLAN is used to create virtual networks out of ports on one or more switches.
 When data is broadcast on the VLAN, it is sent only to members of the VLAN,
 not the entire switch. Systems can communicate only with other systems on their
 VLAN and cannot communicate with systems on other VLANs without the use of
 router.
 Some other popular networking components are routers, gateways, and firewalls.
 Routers are layer-3 devices that are responsible for sending data from one network to
 another. A gateway is responsible for converting data from one format to another so
 that the data can be understood on both sides of the gateway. A firewall is a device
 that stops traffic from passing through it, protecting private network resources. Two-Minute Drill 155

 network interface Cards
 q Network interface cards (NICs) function by converting parallel data from
 the computer to a serial bit stream sent on the network.
 q The computer must have a software driver installed to enable it to interact
 with the NIC, just as it must for any other peripheral device.
 q The media access control (MAC) address, or hardware address, is a 12-digit
 number that is used to determine where the data is being sent and where it is
 coming from. The MAC address also is known as a layer-2 address and looks
 like 00-0D-60-48-53-9E.
 q A computer bus is the term used for the speed and type of interface the
 computer uses with various types of interface cards and equipment. Popular
 bus architectures are ISA, PCI, and PCMCIA for laptops. When you install
 a network card, you will need to be familiar with what bus slot you will place
 the card into.
 q The network card uses a transceiver to pick up the electrical signals and send
 electrical signals on the wire. There are two types of transceivers: built in and
 external. The transceivers for twisted-pair and thinnet usually are built into the
 network card, whereas the transceiver for thicknet is usually an external one.
 q When you are configuring the network card, you may need to specify the
 transfer rate so that it supports the device you are connecting to. You also
 may need to specify the transceiver you intend to use, the transmission type,
 and whether to use half duplex or full duplex.
 q Simplex transmissions allow data to be sent in only one direction. Half
 duplex allows data to be sent and received, but not at the same time. Full
 duplex allows data to be sent and received at the same time.

 Hubs, Maus, and repeaters
 q Hubs are the central location to which all cabling must connect in most
 topologies.
 q When exam time comes, remember the difference between an active hub and
 a passive hub. An active hub contains electronic components to boost the
 signal. A passive hub does not. 156 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 q A multistation access unit (MAU) is a device to which multiple workstations
 are connected in order to communicate on a Token Ring network.
 q Because the signal gets weaker over distance, repeaters are used to regenerate
 the signal so that it can continue in its travels.
 q Hubs, MAUs, and repeaters are layer-1 devices.


 bridges and switches
 q A bridge is used to create multiple segments on the network. The bridge will
 forward network traffic only to the destination segment and not to all seg-
 ments, thus acting as a filtering device to improve network performance.
 q A switch filters network traffic by sending data only to the port on the switch
 where the destination system resides.
 q Switches are replacing hubs, and network administrators who wish to im-
 prove network performance should replace their hubs with switches.
 q Some switches support virtual LANs (VLANs). A VLAN is a group of ports
 on the switch that make up their own logical network. Systems on a particu-
 lar VLAN can communicate only with other systems on the same VLAN
 unless a router is used. The VLAN also acts as a broadcast domain, because
 broadcast traffic is sent only to ports in the VLAN where the sender of the
 broadcast traffic exists.
 q Bridges and switches are layer-2 devices.


 routers and brouters
 q A router is a layer-3 device that sends data from one network to another us-
 ing a layer-3 address such as an IP address.
 q Routers are used by routable protocols such as IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, and
 AppleTalk.
 q A brouter is a device that combines a bridge and a router. The brouter will
 act as a router for routable protocols but will act as a bridge for nonroutable
 protocols such as NetBEUI. Two-Minute Drill 157


gateways and security Devices
 q A gateway is a device that is used to join dissimilar environments together.
 q The gateway converts data from one side of the gateway to a format that the
 other side of the gateway will understand.
 q A firewall is a device that blocks all network traffic from passing through
 the firewall in order to protect private network resources. The firewall may
 be configured to allow selected traffic to pass through. For example, most
 companies have a web server that publishes their web site, so they will need
 to allow HTTP traffic to pass through the firewall.

other networking Devices
 q Modems are used as remote connectivity devices to connect systems across
 telephone wires. The modem converts digital signals to analog on the sending
 computer and converts analog signals to digital on the receiving computer.
 q CSU/DSU is a network device that allows an organization to connect to a
 high-speed link such as a T1 or T3.
 q ISDN is a digital service that is used to connect systems over a digital phone
 line and to receive transmission rates faster than conventional modems. 158 Chapter 3: Networking Components

seLf test ansWers

network interface Cards
 1. þ C. A network card provides the capability to communicate with other computers across
 a network medium such as a CAT 5 cable. The network card connects to the cable using a
 transceiver which is responsible for sending and receiving the electrical signals on the wire.
 Network interface cards (NICs) are known by a variety of names, including network adapters,
 network cards, network adapter boards, and media access cards. Regardless of the name, they
 function by enabling computers to communicate across a network. NICs are often defined
 by the following criteria: 1) The type of data link protocol they support, such as an Ethernet
 adapter or a Token Ring adapter. 2) The type of medium to which they connect, such as TP or
 thinnet. 3) The data bus for which they were designed, such as ISA, PCI, or USB.
 ý A is incorrect because a NIC does not help increase the bus speed between the CPU
 and the hard drive; that would require a different, faster system bus that is based on the
 system clock, which controls the bus speed. B is incorrect because a NIC does not provide
 communications on a phone line—a modem does. D is incorrect since the NIC has no bearing
 or connection to the diskette drive.
 2. þ B. The computer must have a software driver installed to enable the operating system to
 interact with the NIC, just as it must for any other peripheral device. These drivers enable the
 operating system and higher-level applications to control the functions of the adapter. The
 NICs that exist in the various workstations on a network communicate with each other using
 their own unique addresses. The hardware address, or MAC address as it is commonly called, is
 unique on each network card on a network.
 ý A is incorrect because the documentation for a device or add-in card is for user reference
 only and has no bearing on the device’s functionality. C is incorrect because all PCs must
 already have a bus for all internal components of the PC to communicate with one another.
 D is incorrect because the operating system does need to have instructions to communicate
 with a device, which requires a driver.
 3. þ C. The transceiver-type setting is required for network adapters that are capable of
 attaching to more than one media type. Typical cards of this nature include Ethernet cards that
 have both twisted-pair and coaxial connectors. This is one of the more common oversights
 in configuring a NIC and renders the card nonfunctional if configured for the wrong media
 connection. To alleviate this problem, some cards of this type have an auto setting that causes
 the card to search for the transceiver that has media connected to it. From a troubleshooting
 point of view, you should be prepared for the auto setting not to be working, and you may need
 to manually specify the transceiver type. 164 Chapter 3: Networking Components



 ý A is incorrect because the IRQ setting allows you to specify that the IRQ is used to get the
 processor’s attention, allowing the device to get some processing time. B and D are incorrect
 because the link light on/off setting and the PCI setting do not exist.
 4. þ B. When troubleshooting any kind of problem, you want to check the easy stuff first.
 When it comes to network cards, the first thing you want to check is the link light on the back
 of the computer to verify that there is an actual connection to the network.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Although the driver and switch are definitely things you should
 verify, they would not be at the top of my list. After verifying that there is a link, I would check
 the settings on the network card, such as the transceiver type; if that did not work, I would try
 replacing the driver with a newer version.
 5. þ D. A layer-2 address is a MAC address and looks like 00-0D-60-48-53-9E.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. 192.168.2.5 is an example of an IP address, which is a layer-3
 address. COMPUTER100 is an example of a NetBIOS name, and computer100.glensworld.loc
 is an example of a fully qualified domain name.
 6. þ B. An AUI connector is a 15-pin D female connector. With an external transceiver, the
 actual media connection is made external to the NIC using a small device that attaches via an
 extension cable. These types of connections use an adapter unit interface (AUI) connector, also
 called a Digital-Intel-Xerox (DIX) connector, on the back of the NIC. The AUI connector is a
 female 15-pin D-connector that looks very much like a joystick port.
 ý A is incorrect because a 9-pin male connector is found on the back of PCs and is the serial
 port. C is incorrect because a 25-pin connector is found on the back of a PC as the printer
 connection. D is incorrect because the RJ-45 is used with twisted-pair cable networks.

Hubs, Maus and repeaters
 7. þ C. The function of a passive hub is simply to receive data from one port of the hub and
 send it out to the other ports. For example, an eight-port hub receives data from port 3 and then
 resends that data to ports 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. It is as simple as that. A passive hub contains
 no power source or electrical components. There is no signal processing. It simply attaches the
 ports internally and enables communication to flow through the network.
 ý A is incorrect because the active hub does regenerate the signal, since it is powered. B is
 incorrect because, even though the hybrid hub is powered, the only difference between it and
 a regular hub is that the hybrid hub has connectors for different media types. D is incorrect
 because a switch is always powered and therefore will regenerate the data signals.
 8. þ D. Repeaters can be used to extend the length of the maximum distance of the different
 types of cables, because when a signal reaches a repeater, the repeater regenerates the signal. Self Test Answers 165


 ý A is incorrect because a passive hub does not regenerate signals, given that it is not
 powered. B is incorrect because a NIC generates a signal but does not regenerate a signal.
 C is incorrect because the IRQ is used to get the CPU’s attention by interrupting it to perform
 processing.
 9. þ C. A hybrid hub is one that can use many types of cables. A popular example of a hybrid
 hub is a hub that has connectors for thinnet and twisted-pair cabling.
 ý A and B are incorrect because active and passive hubs deal with the question of whether
 they will regenerate the signal or not; this has nothing to do with the connector types on the
 hub. D is incorrect because a MAU is for Token Ring networks and does not support multiple
 connector types.
10. þ B. A multistation access unit (MAU) is a hub-type device in Token Ring environments.
 Remember that the MAUs are connected together by a ring-in/ring-out feature.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because they are terms that were made up to trick you!
11. þ C. Remember that with hubs, when a data signal reaches the hub, the hub sends the signal
 throughout the entire network bus, which includes ports on that hub and any linked hubs. Hubs
 perform no filtering of traffic, which is what a switch offers!
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because the signal will be sent to all ports on all linked hubs.

bridges and switches
12. þ C. Switching is a fairly involved process that allows the device to have the full bandwidth
 when transmitting.
 ý A is incorrect because the bandwidth is divided among all used ports on a hub. B is
 incorrect because a repeater does not split bandwidth, inasmuch as it is used only to receive
 signals on one cable and regenerate the signal on another cable. D is incorrect because a
 transceiver is the connection point on a NIC and does not allow for multiple users to send data
 through the transceiver. The bandwidth on the transceiver is dedicated to the PC in which the
 NIC is installed.
13. þ A. A switch is different from a hub in the sense that with a switch the data is sent only
 to the port that hosts the destination system. This minimizes network traffic and increases
 throughput on the network.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because a switch will forward the signal only to the port on
 which the destination system resides.
14. þ D. Because a bridge works with MAC addresses, it is considered a layer-2 device.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. A hub and a repeater are examples of layer-1 devices; a router is
 an example of a layer-3 device. 166 Chapter 3: Networking Components



15. þ B. A VLAN is a way to group ports on a switch so that each grouping is its own virtual
 network. Systems can communicate only with other systems on their own VLAN, which
 includes broadcast traffic. If a system sends broadcast traffic on the wire, it will be sent only to
 other ports on the same VLAN.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. WANs, MANs, and CANs are terms used for types of networks;
 they have nothing to do with features of a switch.

routers and brouters
16. þ C. A router runs at layer 3 of the OSI model.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. An example of a layer-1 device would be a hub or repeater,
 and an example of a layer-2 device would be a bridge or a switch. A gateway could be a layer-4
 device.
17. þ D. A brouter will route information using a routable protocol and will bridge information
 being sent using a nonroutable protocol.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. A router simply routes or sends data from one network to
 another, whereas a bridge filters data within the network by sending data to the appropriate

 T he most popular protocol in use today is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
 Protocol (TCP/IP). The Internet and most company intranets currently use TCP/IP
 because of its popularity, flexibility, compatibility, and capability to perform in both small
 and large network implementations. TCP/IP can connect a diverse range of hosts, from mainframes
 to palmtop computers. The popularity of this protocol makes it a likely culprit to appear many
 times throughout the Network+ exam. Although TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol,
 it is not the easiest to configure or even to understand. This chapter gives you an in-depth
 understanding of TCP/IP, including the architecture, addressing issues, and configuration involved
 with its use. The Network+ exam will test your knowledge of the protocol, but most importantly,
 it will test your ability to configure the protocol on workstations. Real-world experience, in
 addition to this chapter on TCP/IP, will ensure that you can easily answer any TCP/IP-related
 questions presented to you on the exam.

tCP/iP Protocol suite
 The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the protocol suite
 used by most, if not all, networking environments today. TCP/IP is used on small,
 medium, and large networks and has been adopted as the protocol of the Internet.
 TCP/IP is a protocol suite—meaning that there are multiple protocols within the
 TCP/IP protocol. You will be required to know a number of these protocols for the
 Network+ exam.
 As you learn in this chapter, each protocol in the suite has a specific purpose
 and function. It is not important for the Network+ exam that you understand the
 evolution of TCP/IP, so we discuss here the details of the protocol on which you are
 likely to be tested. Be sure to spend your time on the TCP/IP chapters, because this
 knowledge will help you throughout your years as a networking professional.


the tCP/iP Model
 Contained within the TCP/IP model is a four-layer model similar in concept to the
 seven-layer OSI model. The four layers of the TCP/IP model map out to the seven
 layers of the OSI, but you may find that one layer of the TCP/IP model combines TCP/IP Protocol Suite 171


 multiple layers of the OSI model, as shown in Figure 4-1. There are several protocols
 that direct how computers connect and communicate using TCP/IP within the TCP/
 IP protocol suite, and each protocol runs on different layers of the Internet model.
 Let’s start at the top of this model, which is the application layer. The application
 layer is responsible for making the network request (sending computer) or servicing
 the request (receiving computer). For example, when a user submits a request from a
 web browser, the web browser is responsible for the submission of the request and is
 running at this layer. When that web request reaches the web server, the web server,
 running at the application layer, accepts that request. The following are popular
 application-layer protocols; for more information, see the section “Application-
 Layer Protocols” in this chapter:

 n Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
 n Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
 n Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP)
 n File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 transport Layer
 The next layer under the application layer is the transport layer. The transport layer
 is responsible for both connection-oriented communication (a session is established)
 and connectionless communication (a session is not established). When the request
 comes down from the higher (application) layer, a transport protocol is then chosen.
 The two transport protocols in TCP/IP are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

 transmission Control Protocol The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is
 responsible for providing connection-oriented communication and ensuring delivery
 of the data. TCP will make sure that the data reaches its destination by retransmit-
 ting any data that is lost or corrupt. TCP is used by applications that require a reli-
 able transport, but this transport has more overhead than a connectionless protocol
 because of the construction of the session and monitoring and retransmission of any
 data across that session.
 Another factor to remember about TCP is that the protocol requires that the
 recipient acknowledge the successful receipt of data. Of course, all the acknowledgments,
 known as ACKs, generate additional traffic on the network, which causes a reduction
 in the amount of data that can be passed within a given time frame. The extra
 overhead involved in the creation, monitoring, and ending of the TCP session is
 worth the certainty that TCP will ensure that the data will reach its destination.

 user Datagram Protocol The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) offers a con-
 nectionless datagram service that is an unreliable “best-effort” delivery. UDP does
 not guarantee the arrival of datagrams, nor does
 it promise that the delivered packets are in the
 correct sequence. Applications that don’t require

 considered layer-4 (transport) protocols Because of the lack of overhead involved in UDP
 of the OSI model. conversations, it is more efficient than TCP.


 internet Layer
 After a transport protocol has been selected, which boils down to whether the
 communication should be connection-oriented or connectionless, the information
 is passed to the Internet layer to determine who is responsible for the delivery of the
 information. There are a few protocols that run at the Internet layer; IP, ICMP, and
 ARP are examples. TCP/IP Protocol Suite 173


 internet Protocol The Internet Protocol (IP) provides packet delivery for
 protocols higher in the model. It is a connectionless delivery system that makes a
 “best-effort” attempt to deliver the packets to the correct destination. IP does not
 guarantee delivery of the packets—that is the responsibility of transport protocols;
 IP simply sends the data.
 The IP protocol is also responsible for the logical addressing and routing of TCP/
 IP and therefore is considered a layer-3 protocol
 (of the OSI model). The IP protocol on the
 router is responsible for decrementing (usually
 IP is a layer-3 protocol by a value of 1) the TTL (time to live) of the
(of the OSI model) and is responsible for packet to prevent it from running around in a
logical addressing and routing. “network loop.” Windows operating systems
 have a default TTL of 128.

 internet Control Message Protocol The Internet Control Message Protocol
 (ICMP) enables systems on a TCP/IP network to share status and error information.
 You can use the status information to detect network trouble. ICMP messages are
 encapsulated within IP datagrams so that they may be routed throughout a network.
 Two programs that use ICMP messages are Ping and Tracert.
 You can use Ping to send ICMP echo requests to an IP address and wait for ICMP
 echo responses. Ping reports the time interval between sending the request and
 receiving the response. With Ping, you can determine whether a particular IP system
 on your network is functioning correctly. You can use many different options with
 the Ping utility.
 Tracert traces the path taken to a particular
 host. This utility can be very useful in trouble-
 shooting internetworks. Tracert sends ICMP
 ICMP is the protocol in the echo requests to an IP address while it

 succeeding echo request should get one further
 into the network before the TTL field reaches 0
 and an “ICMP time exceeded” error message is returned by the router attempting to
 forward it.
 Also note that Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is another Internet
 layer protocol and is used for multicast applications. 174 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 address resolution Protocol The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
 provides IP address–to–physical address resolution on a TCP/IP network. To accom-
 plish this feat, ARP sends out a broadcast message with an ARP request packet
 that contains the IP address of the system it is
 trying to find. All systems on the local network
 see the message, and the system that owns the
 IP address for which ARP is looking replies by
 ARP is responsible for sending its physical address to the originating

 All systems maintain ARP caches that
 include IP address–to–physical address
 mappings. The ARP cache is always checked for an IP address–to–physical address
 mapping before initiating a broadcast. You can learn more about the ARP utility and
 other related TCP/IP utilities in Chapter 6.


application-Layer Protocols
 Now that you have learned some of the core protocols such as TCP, UDP, and IP in
 the TCP/IP protocol suite, let’s take a look at some of the application-level protocols
 that run at the application layer of the TCP/IP Internet model.

 HttP and HttPs
 The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used on the Internet to
 allow clients to request web pages from web servers and to allow client interaction
 with those web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the web servers
 are not aware of what a client has or has not requested and cannot track users who
 have requested specific content. This system does not allow for good interaction
 with the web server but does allow for retrieving the HTML pages stored on web
 sites. To aid in tracking client requests, we use cookies—small files stored on the
 client computer that allow the web server to store data on the client that the client
 will send back with each request to the server.
 The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Secure (HTTPS) allows you to connect to
 a web site and receive and send content in an encrypted format using the Secure
 Sockets Layer (SSL). HTTPS is most commonly used on e-commerce sites to
 allow you to send personal information without worrying that an Internet hacker is TCP/IP Protocol Suite 175


 viewing this information, especially credit card numbers and other confidential data.
 You can determine when HTTPS is being used because the address of the web site
 starts with https:// and not http://, which marks the regular HTTP protocol. Another
 sign that HTTPS is in use: In Internet Explorer, a lock appears in the status bar of
 a page; the lock is either closed or locked (as
 shown in Figure 4-2).
 Normally, HTTPS is not used for an entire
 e-commerce site, because the encryption and

 information uses HTTPS.

 network time Protocol (ntP)
 The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the clocks of PCs on
 a network or the Internet. This is accomplished by configuring a server to be the
 time server, which then is the server from which all other PCs on the network
 synchronize their time.

Explorer 176 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 On earlier Windows networks, you can manage time synchronization by placing
 a command in a logon script to synchronize the time on the client with the time
 server. Use the following command:
 NET TIME computername /SET

 Newer Microsoft networks, such as Active Directory networks, have the PDC
 emulator provide the time to all servers and clients automatically, so there is no
 need to create a logon script for the clients to synchronize the time with the time
 server. PDC emulators can also retrieve their time from Internet NTP servers.
 Time servers on the Internet allow you to synchronize your PC’s clock with the
 exact time kept by atomic clocks. The time synchronization takes into account
 time zone settings of your operating system and allows you to synchronize with a
 time server even if it is not set for your local time zone.

 network news transfer Protocol (nntP)
 News clients use the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) to send and
 retrieve news articles to a newsgroup. Newsgroups are typically used as a place for
 users to post questions and answers on a particular topic area (called a newsgroup).
 NNTP uses TCP to send and receive news articles. NNTP allows the submission
 and retrieval of only the news articles that have not previously been sent or
 retrieved.

 simple Mail transfer Protocol (sMtP)
 The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send or route mail over a
 TCP/IP network such as the Internet. Most e-mail server products support SMTP in
 order to send e-mail out of the corporation and onto the Internet.

 Post office Protocol 3 (PoP3)
 The Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3) is the Internet protocol used to
 retrieve e-mail from a mail server down to the POP3 client. The e-mail is
 “popped” or downloaded to the client after the client has been authenticated to
 its mailbox. POP3 has limited capabilities as far as folder support is concerned.
 A POP3 client supports only an inbox, an outbox, sent items, and deleted items.
 If additional folder support is required, you would need to use an IMAP4 client. TCP/IP Protocol Suite 177


 internet Message access Protocol 4 (iMaP4)
 The Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4 (IMAP4) is another protocol
 similar to POP3 that allows clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. IMAP4
 allows additional folders other than the four basic ones provided with POP3. For
 example, you can use an IMAP4 client to connect to public folders stored on an
 Exchange Server.




 POP3 and IMAP4 are whereas SMTP is the Internet protocol for
the Internet protocols for reading e-mail, sending e-mail.



 simple network Management Protocol (snMP)
 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet standard that
 provides a simple method for remotely managing virtually any network device that
 supports SNMP. A network device can be a network card in a server; a program or
 service running on a server; or a network device such as a hub, switch, or router.
 The SNMP standard defines a two-tiered approach to network device
 management: a central management system and the management information base
 (MIB) located on the managed device. The management system can monitor one or
 many MIBs, allowing for centralized management of a network. From a management
 system, you can see valuable performance and network device operation statistics,
 enabling you to diagnose network health without leaving your office.
 The goal of a management system is to provide centralized network
 management. Any computer running SNMP management software is referred
 to as a management system. For a management system to be able to perform
 centralized network management, it must be able to collect and analyze many
 things, including the following:

 n Network protocol identification and statistics
 n Dynamic identification of computers attached to the network (referred to as
 discovery)
 n Hardware and software configuration data 178 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 n Computer performance and usage statistics
 n Computer event and error messages
 n Program and application usage statistics


 file transfer Protocol (ftP)
 The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a TCP/IP protocol that exists to upload and
 download files between FTP servers and clients. Like Telnet and Ping, FTP can
 establish a connection to a remote computer using either the hostname or the IP
 address and must resolve hostnames to IP addresses to establish communication with
 the remote computer.
 When TCP/IP is installed on the system, there is an FTP utility available, but
 there are also a number of third-party graphical user interface (GUI) FTP clients
 available for all operating systems. If you use FTP a great deal, a GUI FTP client
 could save you a lot of time and frustration in dealing with FTP commands.

 trivial file transfer Protocol (tftP)
 The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple protocol compared to FTP
 that supports only reading and writing to files and does not support features such
 as listing directory contents and authentication. TFTP uses UDP as the transport
 protocol, as opposed to FTP, which uses TCP. TFTP is typically used to boot diskless
 workstations.

 secure file transfer Protocol (sftP)
 The Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is an interactive file transfer protocol
 similar to FTP, but it encrypts all traffic between the SFTP client and the SFTP
 server. SFTP supports additional features such as public key authentication and
 compression. Unlike TFTP, SFTP does support a number of commands in its
 interactive shell such as listing directory contents, creating directories, downloading
 files, and uploading files.

 telnet
 Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol that allows a client to run or emulate the
 program running on the server. A number of devices allow you to telnet into the
 device and perform remote administration of the network device using the command
 set available to the Telnet session. TCP/IP Protocol Suite 179


 secure shell (ssH)
 The Secure Shell (SSH) is a program used to create a shell, or session, with a remote
 system. Once the remote session is established, the client can execute commands
 within this shell and copy files to the local system. SSH has a major purpose in
 life, and that is to support remote shells with support for secure authentication and
 encrypted communication.

 secure Copy Protocol (sCP)
 The Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) is responsible for copying files from a remote
 server to the local system over a secure connection, ensuring that data in transit is
 kept confidential. A number of SCP products use an SSH connection to ensure the
 security of the secure copy operation.

 Lightweight Directory access Protocol (LDaP)
 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the TCP/IP protocol for
 directory service access that is supported by all the principal directory services,
 such as Novell’s eDirectory and Microsoft’s
 Active Directory. LDAP is a protocol that
 allows LDAP clients to connect to the network
 LDAP is the industry- database, or directory, and query the database
standard protocol for accessing a for information about its objects, such as user
directory service and is supported by accounts and printers. For example, a user on
Active Directory and Novell’s eDirectory. the network could find out the phone number of
 another user by using the LDAP protocol.

 Line Printer Daemon (LPD) and Line Printer remote (LPr)
 The line printer daemon (LPD) is a printer protocol, or service, installed on the
 print server to allow line printer remote (LPR) clients to send print requests to the
 print server. When LPD receives the print request, it stores the print request in a
 queue until the printer becomes available.
 Now that you are acquainted with some of the core protocols of TCP/IP and some
 of the application-layer protocols that run on top of TCP/IP, let’s take a look at the
 possible scenarios involving TCP/IP protocols and services and their appropriate
 solutions. 180 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals




CertifiCation objeCtive 4.02


tCP/iP fundamentals
 Now that you have learned some of the popular protocols that exist in the TCP/
 IP protocol suite, this section will introduce you to the configuration of TCP/IP by
 discussing the addressing scheme and rules for assigning an address to a system.


tCP/iP settings
 TCP/IP is a protocol that requires a little bit of knowledge to configure the systems
 properly. When you configure TCP/IP, you are required to know the settings for the
 IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Let’s start with the IP address!

 iP address
 The IP address is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies the system on the network
 (or the Internet). An IP address looks similar in appearance to 192.168.1.15. There
 are four decimal values in an IP address separated by periods (.). Each decimal value
 is made up of 8 bits (1s and 0s), and there are four decimal values, so 8 bits times
 4 equals the 32-bit address.
 Since each of the decimal values is made up of 8 bits (for example, the 192), we
 refer to each of the decimal values as an octet. There are four octets in an IP address.
 It is very important to understand that the four octets in an IP address are divided
 into two parts—a network ID and a host ID. The subnet mask determines the
 number of bits that make up the network ID and the number of bits that make up
 the host ID. Let’s see how this works.

 subnet Mask
 When looking at a subnet mask, if there is a 255 in an octet, then the corresponding
 octet in the IP address is part of the network ID. For example, if I had an IP address
 of 192.168.1.15 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the first three octets would
 make up the network ID and the last octet would be the host ID. The network ID
 assigns a unique address to the network itself, while the host ID uniquely identifies
 the system on the network. Table 4-1 summarizes this example.
 You can see in Table 4-1 that the network ID (shown with an “N”) is 192.168.1,
 and the host ID is the last octet with a value of 15. This means that this system is TCP/IP Fundamentals 181


 on the 192.168.1 network and any other system on the same network will have the
 same network ID.
 To use a different example, if I had a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, it would mean that
 the first octet of the IP address is used as the network ID portion, while the last three
 octets are the host ID portion of the IP address.
 So what is the purpose of the subnet masks? Or better yet, why do we have
 a subnet mask that breaks the IP address into a network ID part and a host ID?
 The reason is so that when a system such as 192.168.1.15, with a subnet mask of
 255.255.255.0, sends a piece of data to 192.198.45.10, the sending system first needs
 to determine whether the target computer exists on the same network or not. It does
 this by comparing the network IDs (Table 4-2); if the network IDs are the same,
 then both systems exist on the same network and one system can send to the other
 without the use of a router. If the systems exist on different networks, the data will
 need to be passed to the router so that the router can send the data to the other
 network.
 Let’s take a look at an exercise in which you will need to determine whether two
 systems are on the same network or not.

 Be sure to do Exercise 4-1 found in the LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM.

 Default gateway
 When your system wants to send data to another system on the network, it looks at
 its own network ID and compares that to the destination system’s IP address. If it
 appears that they both have the same network ID, the data is sent directly from your
 system to the destination system. If the two systems are on different networks, your
 system must pass the data to the router so that the router can send the data to the
 destination system’s router.
 The question is now, how does your system know who the router is? The answer
 is “that is what the default gateway is.” The default gateway is the IP address of the
 router that can send data from your network.
 In order to communicate on the Internet, your system will need to be
 configured with an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway. If you need to
 communicate only with other systems on your network, you will need only an IP
 address and a subnet mask.
 To view your TCP/IP settings, you can go to a command prompt and type
 ipconfig—you should see output similar to that shown in Figure 4-3. You will learn
 more about TCP/IP-related commands later in this chapter and in Chapter 6.

tCP/iP addressing
 This section will introduce you to the binary representation of an IP address
 and ensure that before you move onto the next chapter (on subnetting) you feel
 comfortable with converting binary values to decimal and address classes. TCP/IP Addressing 183


understanding binary
 You know from the previous discussion that the IP address is a 32-bit address divided
 into four 8-bit blocks (called octets). The four octets are normally displayed as
 decimal values but also have a binary representation that looks like
 11000000 10101000 00000001 00001111

 Notice that there are four sets of 8 bits (1 or 0), which makes up the 32 bits
 (8 × 4 sets) of an IP address. Let’s take a look at how you can determine the binary
 representation of an octet. The values of the 8 bits within the octet are shown in
 Table 4-3.
 Looking at Table 4-3, you can see that the first bit in an octet (far right) has
 a decimal value of 1, the second bit has a decimal value of 2, the third bit has a
 decimal value of 4, and the values keep doubling with each additional bit. You can
 also see that the eighth bit has a decimal value of 128. The first bit is known as
 the least significant bit or low-order bit, while the eighth bit is known as the most
 significant bit or high-order bit.
 To calculate the binary value of an octet with a decimal number such as 192, you
 need to enable, or turn on, the bits that will add up to the number of 192, as shown
 in Table 4-4.
 Notice that the foregoing table has bit eight and bit seven turned on to give you
 a value of 128 + 64, which equals 192. The remaining bits will take an “off” state,
 which means they are not included in the calculation. A bit that has an on state
 takes a “1,” and an off state takes a “0.” So the combination of 8 bits to make the
 number 192 would be 11000000. Now that you know how to convert a decimal
 value to binary and a binary value to decimal, try out Exercise 4-2 before moving on
 to the section on address classes.

address Classes
 Every IP address belongs to a distinct address class. The Internet community defined
 these classes to accommodate networks of various sizes. The class to which the IP
 address belongs initially determines the network ID and host ID portions of the
 address, along with the number of hosts that are supported on that network. The
 different class addresses are named class A, class B, class C, class D, and class E. This
 section details each class of addresses.

 Class a addresses
 A class A address has a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, which means that the
 first octet is the network ID and the last three octets belong to the host ID portion
 of the address. Each octet can contain 256 possible values (0–255), so a class A
 address supports 16,777,216 hosts on the network (256 × 256 × 256). Actually, there
 are only 16,777,214 valid addresses to use on systems, inasmuch as there are two
 addresses on each IP network you are not allowed to assign to systems because they
 are reserved. These are the addresses with all host bits set to 0s (the network ID) and
 all host bits set to 1s (the broadcast address). So
 with a class A address, you will not be able to
 assign n.0.0.0 or n.255.255.255 (where n is your
 network ID) to any hosts on the network.
 Class A addresses have
 You can always identify a class A address,
 an IP address in which the first octet is
 because the value of the first octet falls between
 between 1 and 126. Class A addresses also

 starts with 127 is a class A address as well, but
 you are not allowed to use any address that starts
 with 127, because it is reserved for the loopback
 address (more on the loopback address later). For example, the IP address 12.56.87.34
 is a class A address because the first octet is 12, which falls in the range 1–126.

 Class b addresses
 Class B addresses have a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, which means that the

 Class C addresses
 Class C addresses have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which means that the first
 three octets are the network ID and the last octet is the host ID. Having only one

 Class D addresses
 Class D addresses are used for special types of applications on the network known
 as multicasting applications. Multicasting applications send data to a number of
 systems at the same time by sending data to the multicast address, and anyone who
 has registered with that address will receive the data. A multicast address is what
 class D addresses are used for, so you will not be assigning them specifically to hosts
 on the network for normal network communication.
 Class D addresses have a value on the first octet that ranges from 224 to 239.
 With that many ranges, class D has the potential for 268,435,456 unique multicast
 groups that users can subscribe to from a multicast application. 186 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 Class e addresses
 The funny thing about class E addresses is that they were designed for experimental
 purposes only, so you will never see a class E address on a network. Class E addresses
 have a first octet with a value that falls in the range of 240–247.
 Now that you are familiar with the different class addresses, take a look at
 Table 4-5, which summarizes the address classes. Be sure to know them for the exam.

 which is found on the CD-ROM.



Loopback address
 You have learned that you are not allowed to have a host assigned an IP address that
 has a value of 127 in the first octet. This is because the class A address range of 127
 has been reserved for the loopback address.
 The loopback address is used to refer to the local system, also known as the
 localhost. If you want to verify that the TCP/IP software has initialized on the local
 system even though you may not have an IP address, you may ping the loopback
 address, which is typically referred to as 127.0.0.1. TCP/IP Addressing 187


 You can test your own local system by typing ping 127.0.0.1, ping
 localhost, or ping loopback, to verify that the TCP/IP protocol stack is
 functioning on your system.


Private addresses
 Another type of address you need to be aware of is what is known as a private
 address. A private address is an address that can be assigned to a system but cannot
 be used for any kind of Internet connectivity. The private addresses are nonroutable
 addresses, so any system using them will not be able to function off the network. The
 following are the three address ranges that are private:

 n 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255
 n 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
 n 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255

 Not being able to route data across the Internet when using these addresses will
 not pose a problem, because realistically, you will have these private addresses sitting

 address to a public address that can be routed on the Internet. For more information
 on NAT, refer to the section “Network Services” later in this chapter.


addressing schemes
 When sending data on the network, there are different ways that the data can
 be sent to the destination. The data can be sent to a unicast address, a broadcast
 address, or a multicast address. The following outlines the difference between
 unicast, broadcast, and multicast:

 n Unicast Is the sending of information to one system. With the IP protocol
 this is accomplished by sending data to the IP address of the intended
 destination system.
 n Broadcast Is the sending of information to all systems on the network. Data
 that is destined for all systems is sent by using the broadcast address for the
 network. An example of a broadcast address for a network is 192.168.2.255.
 The broadcast address is determined by setting all host bits to 1 and then
 converting the octet to a decimal number.
 n Multicast Is the sending of information to a selected group of systems.
 Typically this is accomplished by having the systems subscribe to a multicast
 address. Any data that is sent to the multicast address is then received by
 all systems subscribed to the address. Most multicast addresses start with
 224.x.y.z and are considered class D addresses.

iPv6
 Our entire discussion so far about TCP/IP is based on version 4 of TCP/IP, known
 as IPv4. The use of TCP/IP over the years has far exceeded expectations, and we are
 running out of IP addresses. For that reason, TCP/IP has been redesigned and the
 new version is IP version 6 (IPv6).
 There are major changes to IPv6 from what we know of IPv4. For starters, IPv4
 uses a 32-bit address scheme, while IPv6 will use a 128-bit address scheme. This will
 give us an insane number of unique possible addresses—3.4 × 1038 to be exact (2128)!
 This is a huge improvement over 232=4 billion unique addresses with IPv4.
 An IPv6 address will no longer use four octets. The IPv6 address is divided into
 eight hexadecimal values that are separated by a colon (:) as shown in the following
 example:
 65b3:b834:45a3:0000:0000:762e:0270:5224 TCP/IP Addressing 189


 A number of different devices and software now support both IPv4 and IPv6, but
 it will be a few years yet before we see all systems and devices using only IPv6.


tCP/iP Ports
 An application or process uses a TCP/IP port as an identifier for that application
 running on a system. When you send data from one computer to another, you send
 data to the port used by that application. For example, when you type the IP address
 of a web site in your web browser, the web browser connects to the web server (or web
 application) running at that system by sending data to port 80 (shown in Figure 4-4).
 Port 80 is the default port of a web server. When the web server answers your request
 by sending the web page to your browser, the browser is running on a particular port
 as well and the web server sends the page to the port of the web browser.
 Server applications typically use low port numbers that fall under 1024, whereas
 client applications usually run on ports over 1024. Port numbers that are used by
 servers are known as well-known ports (under 1024), whereas port numbers over
 1024 used by client applications are known as dynamic ports. They are called
 dynamic ports because many times the port is selected at runtime by the application

 and is different each time the program runs. For example, when you start Internet
 Explorer, it may use a different port number each time the program is started, but a
 web server uses the same port each time (port 80).

 applications or protocols. Be sure to know these for the Network+ exam.

viewing tCP/iP Port values
 In this exercise, you will look back to the packet capture that you viewed in
 Chapter 2 for the analysis of web traffic and identify the ports that were used by both
 the web browser (sending system) and the web server (the receiving system).

 1. Start Network Monitor by choosing Start | Programs | Administrative Tools
 | Network Monitor.
 2. Once Network Monitor has started, open the HTTPTraffic capture file from
 the LabFilesPacketCaptures folder.
 3. Double-click the frame in the packet capture that is posting form data to a
 web server (frame 16) to expand the details of that packet.
 4. In the details panel (middle of screen), select the TCP section by clicking it
 once (as shown in the accompanying illustration).

 6. You should have the following answers recorded in the preceding spaces:
 Source Port: ____3556__________
 Destination Port: ____80_________
 7. Keep in mind that the destination port is port 80, which is the default port
 of a web server. You have found that the source port is 3556, which is a value
 above 1024. You have learned that a client application usually uses a value
 above 1024, so this is traffic of a web browser sending data to a web server.
 8. Close Network Monitor and don’t save any information if asked.




 Another term that you will hear a lot is socket. A socket is the end point of
 communication and is made up of three components: the IP address of the system,
 the port number of the application, and the protocol that is being used—either TCP
 or UDP. The socket is the end point of communication for a TCP/IP application
 and is how data is sent from one system to another, or more accurately, from one
 application to another. The following formula defines what a socket is:

 Socket = IP address + Port number + Protocol (TCP or UDP)

tCP/iP Configuration Concepts
 You have learned what an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway are used
 for, and you have learned all about the binary form of addressing, including class
 addresses. In this section, you will learn to configure TCP/IP on a client system both
 manually and as a DHCP client.


Manual Configuration
 To configure TCP/IP on a Windows XP client, you will click the Start button and
 then right-click My Network Places and choose Properties.
 The network connections window appears, and you should see your LAN
 connection. If you right-click your LAN connection and choose Properties, you TCP/IP Configuration Concepts 193


 will see your network settings, including the TCP/IP protocol. To configure TCP/IP,
 select TCP/IP and choose Properties, as the dialog box shows in Figure 4-5.
 To configure your system with a specific address, select Use The Following IP
 Address and then type the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway;
 then choose OK. Once you have finished configuring TCP/IP, you will be able to
 communicate with network resources using the newly configured system.
 Configuring a system manually is not the best approach to take on a network for a
 number of reasons:

 n Workload The amount of work involved in manually configuring each
 system on the network is too much for any network administrator.
 n Typos The potential for human error is great when inputting the
 parameters on multiple systems simply due to the fact that it is such a
 laborious task. It is also very easy to assign a duplicate address on the
 network, which would result in an error.
 n Change management It is very hard to implement major changes to your
 IP infrastructure when you are manually configuring systems. For example, a
 change to a router address would require a lot of time to update the default
 gateway entry on the clients.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
 Configuring IP addressing on a large TCP/IP-based network can be a nightmare,
 especially if machines are moved from one network to another frequently. The
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) can help with the workload of
 configuring systems on a network by assigning addresses to systems on boot-up
 automatically.
 The process of dynamically assigning IP addresses is managed via a DHCP server.
 The DHCP server is configured with a set of usable IP addresses, called a scope. The
 scope can also include the subnet mask, IP addresses of the default gateway, DNS
 servers, WINS servers, and other necessary addresses. When a PC comes online and
 is set up to use a DHCP server, it requests an IP address by transmitting a broadcast
 request packet looking for any DHCP servers on the network (known as DHCP
 Discovery). The DHCP server responds with an offer containing an IP address that
 the client can lease (known as the DHCP Offer). The client then accepts the offer
 by sending a request message for that address from the DHCP server (known as the
 DHCP Request), and then the server responds with an acknowledgment to the
 client that it has that address and additional settings for the lease time (known as
 the DHCP ACK). The DHCP server marks the IP address in its database as being
 in use so that it is not assigned again. When configuring the DHCP server, you will
 need to configure a scope with the following settings:

 n IP addresses The DHCP server issues an IP address to each DHCP client
 system on the network. Each system connected to a TCP/IP-based network
 is identified by a unique IP address. As you learned in this chapter, the IP
 address consists of four 8-bit octets separated by periods. The IP address is
 normally shown in dotted-decimal notation—for example, 192.10.24.62.
 n Subnet mask The IP address actually consists of two parts: the network ID
 and the host ID. The subnet mask is used to identify the part of the IP address
 that is the network ID and the part that is the host ID. Subnet masks assign
 1s to the network ID bits and 0s to the host ID bits of the IP address.
 n Default gateway A default gateway is required when the client system
 needs to communicate outside its own subnet. Normally, the default gateway
 is a router connected to the local subnet, which enables IP packets to be
 passed to other network segments. TCP/IP Configuration Concepts 195


 To learn to configure your system for DHCP, be sure to try Exercise 4-6 found
CertCam 4–6
 in LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM and check out the CertCam training video to
 go with this exercise.


 scope options
 A DHCP scope is the range of IP addresses and additional options that the DHCP
 server will hand out to the DHCP clients on the network. As previously mentioned,
 the IP address and subnet mask are required items that the DHCP scope must include.
 Another requirement in the scope is the lease duration. It specifies how long a DHCP
 client can use an IP address before it must renew it with the DHCP server. This
 duration can be set for an unlimited time period or for a predetermined time period.
 You have the option of configuring a scope to reserve a specific IP address for a DHCP
 client or even for a system on the network that is not DHCP enabled.

 Options within the DHCP scope can be configured for settings such as the
 DNS server, WINS server, router address, and domain name.


 servers
 Several versions of Windows server products support having DHCP server capabilities,
 including Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008. The main factor to
 consider if you have multiple subnets is that your routers must comply with RFC 1542
 so that a DHCP server can receive the broadcast message from a client. It is wise to
 keep in mind that, if your DHCP server goes down and your DHCP clients cannot
 renew their lease, the clients will most likely not be able to access network resources.
 One of the benefits of using multiple DHCP servers is redundancy. Redundancy
 can prevent your network from going down. If you decide to use multiple DHCP
 servers, you should place them on different subnets to achieve a higher degree of
 fault tolerance in case one of the subnets becomes unavailable. You can manage
 multiple servers on different subnets with the DHCP Console, the graphical utility
 used to maintain and configure DHCP servers in Windows.

 In most companies, two DHCP servers provide fault tolerance of IP addressing
 if one server fails or must be taken offline for maintenance. Each DHCP server
 has at least half of the available addresses in an active scope.The number
 of addresses on each DHCP server should be more than enough to provide
 addresses for all clients. 196 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 supported Clients
 The following operating systems can perform as DHCP clients on your network:

 n Windows clients such as Windows 2000, XP, Vista
 n Windows servers such as Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, and
 Windows Server 2008
 n Older Microsoft clients such as DOS (with network client software loaded),
 Windows 3.11, and Windows 9x clients.
 n Non-Microsoft operating systems such as Linux

 Of course, DHCP clients are not limited to Microsoft operating systems. Any
 system that conforms to RFC 1541 can be a DHCP client. For example, you can
 have a UNIX, Linux, or Novell NetWare client on the network that obtains an
 address from your DHCP server as well.


aPiPa
 Windows clients support a feature known as automatic private IP addressing
 (APIPA), which is a feature that provides that, when a Windows client boots up
 and cannot contact a DHCP server, it will configure itself automatically with a
 169.254.x.y address. If there is something wrong with the DHCP server and all the
 systems on the network cannot obtain an address from the DHCP server, the clients
 will all assign themselves an address within the 169.254 address range and then be
 able to communicate with one another.
 APIPA does not assign a default gateway, so you will be unable to access resources
 on a remote network and the Internet—but you can still communicate with
 systems on your network. When troubleshooting to find out why a machine cannot
 communicate on the network, watch for systems that have the 169.254.x.y address
 range because it means they could not find a DHCP server.


boot Protocol
 The Boot Protocol, known as BOOTP, is used by diskless workstations. When a
 diskless workstation boots, it does so using an EEPROM on the network card to
 allow it to load basic drivers and connect to the network by obtaining an IP address
 automatically. TCP/IP Configuration Concepts 197


 A BOOTP server, similar to a DHCP server, assigns the diskless workstation an
 address for the network to allow it to participate on the network. You will see the
 term BOOTP a lot when it comes to DHCP and routers; a BOOTP-enabled router
 will allow the DHCP broadcast to cross the router so that a DHCP server can be
 found on the other side of the network.




 The BOOTP server is allow the DHCP requests to pass through
 usually the same as the DHCP server; the the router to another segment, or else you
 two are considered one and the same. will require a DHCP server per network
 Routers need to be BOOTP compatible to segment.



Domain name system
 One service that is used throughout networks and the Internet is the Domain Name
 System (DNS). Most users on the network connect to resources by using a friendly
 name such as www.gleneclarke.com—this style of name, known as a fully qualified
 domain name (FQDN), must be converted to an IP address before communication
 can occur. DNS is used as our solution to convert FQDNs to IP addresses.
 Let’s walk through an example of a name being resolved. You are sitting in your
 office on your network, and you try to connect to http://www.gleneclarke.com,
 which means that your client computer will send a query to the DNS server (shown
 in Figure 4-6) in your office asking, “Do you have an IP address for www.gleneclarke.
 com?” Your DNS server does not know who www.gleneclarke.com is, so it will then
 go out and query the DNS root servers and ask them if they have an IP address for
 www.gleneclarke.com. There are only about 13 DNS root servers on the Internet;
 they don’t actually hold records for individual hosts, but they do forward the request
 to the name servers at the next level down, which are the .com name servers. DNS
 will find the IP address of the name requested by reading the name from right to
 left—in this case, .com is the far-right name part, so the request is forwarded to the
 .com name servers. The .com name servers look at the request and say, “No, we
 don’t have a clue who www.gleneclarke.com is, but why don’t you check out the
 gleneclarke.com name servers—they might know.” 198 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals

 Your DNS server then queries the name servers for gleneclarke.com and asks
 them, “Do you have an IP address for www.gleneclarke.com?” In this case, the
 DNS servers for gleneclarke.com do have a record for www and they return the IP
 address to the DNS on your network. Now, your DNS server is smart—it will cache
 that data before sending an answer to your client computer that started the whole
 process, so that if anyone else is interested in the address, your DNS server will have
 the answer without going out on the web!

 top-Level Domains
 The root servers are responsible for ensuring that any requests for an Internet
 resource are forwarded to the correct top-level domain. To help organize Internet
 resources in the DNS distributed database, there are specific top-level domain names
 created, and a company or organization has to register under a top-level domain. For
 example, if you are trying to connect to microsoft.com, the root DNS server forwards
 you to the .com top-level domain namespace. TCP/IP Configuration Concepts 199


 The following is a description of the most popular DNS top-level domains found
on the Internet:

 n .com This is the commercial organizations group and is by far the largest.
 Almost everyone wants to be found in this domain, because it is where most
 customers will try to find you.
 n .org This is for nonprofit organizations.
 n .net This is for networking organizations such as island.net and nfs.net, as
 well as for Internet service providers such as netzero.net.
 n .mil This is for military organizations such as army.mil and navy.mil.
 n .gov This is for U.S. government offices only.
 n .edu This is for educational organizations.

Country Domain names
With only six top-level domain names and the requirement that all organizations
register under one of those top levels if they wanted an Internet name, this soon
became a problem because there were so many names to be registered and so few
choices on the top levels. Eventually, top-level names were created for country
domains; therefore, if you resided in a certain country, you could register under that
country domain so that your customers could find you easily. Here are a few of the
most common country domain names:

 n .ca Canada
 n .ie Ireland
 n .uk United Kingdom
 n .us United States

Dns files
Most DNS servers maintain their DNS data in a number of files that exist on the
hard disk of the server. In the old days, you managed the records by updating these
text files, but today most DNS server environments support a graphic tool like the
one shown in Figure 4-7 to create the records for your DNS server. When you create
the records graphically, the DNS files are updated. Windows servers store their DNS
files in %systemroot%system32DNS. 200 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals




 figure 4-7

Managing a
DNS server in
Windows




 For Windows servers running Active Directory, the DNS database can be
 integrated with Active Directory, which allows you to have the DNS data
 replicated with Active Directory and also allows the zone data to be modified
 in multiple locations, given that Active Directory is a multimaster environment.
 If the DNS database is integrated with Active Directory, it will not be located
 in the %systemroot%system32DNS directory but be stored within the Active
 Directory database.



 Hosts file
 Before DNS became a popular solution to hostname resolution, there was a more
 manual method of creating and modifying a file on the local hard disk of every
 system. This file would need to be updated on every system if a change was made
 to a server’s IP address and you wanted the client applications to be aware of the
 change. This file, known as the hosts file, was located on each client system.
 Before DNS servers became a standard, network administrators used to create a
 text file known as the hosts file, which was used to resolve the FQDN to matching
 IP addresses. This text file was stored locally on each system; in the Windows world,
 it is stored in the %systemroot%system32driversetc folder and contains two
 columns—one for the IP address and the other for the FQDN. Figure 4-8 displays
 the contents of a hosts file. TCP/IP Configuration Concepts 201


 figure 4-8

Looking at the
hosts file on a
Windows system




Windows internet naming service
 The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) provides name resolution for
 NetBIOS names to matching IP addresses and is popular on large Microsoft
 networks. WINS is very similar to DNS but contains a database of different-style
 names—NetBIOS names instead of fully qualified domain names.
 When a WINS client boots up, it registers its names within the WINS database
 and then queries that server any time it needs to have a computer name resolved to
 a matching IP address. When the WINS client shuts down, it also de-registers its
 names from the WINS database so that another system can register the names while
 it is offline.
 Before WINS, the LMHOSTS file was used to assist with remote NetBIOS
 name resolution. The LMHOSTS file is a static file that maps NetBIOS names to
 IP addresses. This file is similar to the hosts file in functionality; the only difference
 is that the hosts file is used for mapping hostnames to IP addresses. To configure a
 client for DNS or WINS, follow the steps in Exercise 4-7.

 Be sure to try Exercise 4-7 in LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM and check out
 CertCam 4–7
 the CertCam training video.This exercise demonstrates how to configure your
 client system for a DNS or WINS server.

 Table 4-7 outlines the differences between WINS and DNS. 202 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals

 Name resolution is a very important part of troubleshooting networking
 problems—chances are a large percentage of communication problems come from
 name resolution. To help people troubleshoot name resolution in real life and on
 the Network+ exam, I usually draw for them Figure 4-9, which is a flow chart of the
 types of names and the technologies used to resolve the type of name. For example,
 looking at Figure 4-9, you can see that ARP is used to convert IP addresses to MAC
 addresses, whereas DNS is used to convert the FQDN to the IP address—which is
 then converted to the MAC address by ARP.

Configuring a Linux Machine for tCP/iP
 We have spent most of the examples talking about Windows operating systems
 and how to configure TCP/IP on Windows. Let’s take some time now and focus on
 Linux, one of the biggest competitors to Microsoft Windows. The version of Linux
 that I have installed for this book is Red Hat Linux 8. If you have Red Hat Linux 9,
 you should be able to follow the same steps, because there are not a lot of changes
 regarding this area between the two versions.

 To download a free version of the most current version of Linux, visit
 www.linux.org.

 To change your TCP/IP settings in Linux, you will need to log on to the computer
 with root-level access and then click the Red Hat button in the bottom-left corner
 of the screen. When the menu appears, select System Settings | Network, as shown
 in Figure 4-10.

Hat menu 204 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 Once the Network Configuration dialog box shows, click the Edit button to
 change the IP address that is assigned to the Ethernet device in the Linux machine.
 To statically assign an IP address, select the option Statically Set IP Addresses as
 shown in Figure 4-11.
 If you wish to configure the Linux machine as a DHCP client so that its
 address information is obtained automatically, you will need to bring the Network
 Configuration dialog box up again and select the option that says Automatically
 Obtain IP Address Settings With and ensure that DHCP is selected (as shown in
 Figure 4-12). You will most likely want to ensure that the setting Automatically
 Obtain DNS Information From Provider is selected. This setting allows you to
 configure Linux to obtain the address of the DNS server from DHCP as well.
 Once you have configured TCP/IP on the Linux system, you may want to verify
 the settings by viewing your IP address information. You will look at TCP/IP utilities
 in Chapter 6, but to make our Linux walkthrough complete, let’s take a look at how
 to view the TCP/IP settings in Linux. To view your IP address information in Linux,
 you need to bring up a command prompt, known as a terminal session. To start a
 terminal session, right-click the desktop in Linux and choose New Terminal, as
 shown in Figure 4-13.

 Once the new terminal starts up, you can type ifconfig (case sensitive) to
 view your TCP/IP settings, or you can use the Ping utility to test connectivity to
 another system. Figure 4-14 demonstrates ifconfig being used to view the TCP/IP
 settings of the network interface. You may type exit at the prompt to exit out of
 the terminal. 206 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals

network services
 In this chapter, you have already been introduced to a few network services, such
 as DHCP, DNS, and WINS. This section will review those services briefly and
 introduce you to some additional services you should be familiar with for the
 Network+ exam.
 A network service is responsible for a specific function on the network.
 For example, the file and print services are responsible for providing files on
 the network, and the DHCP service is responsible for assigning IP addresses
 automatically to systems on the network. Let’s identify popular network services
 found on the Network+ exam. Network Services 207


DHCP
 The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is responsible for assigning
 IP address information automatically to systems on the network. The network
 administrator configures the DHCP server by configuring a scope (a range of
 addresses) that the server can assign addresses from. The DHCP service may
 configure a client with all the TCP/IP settings, including the subnet mask, the
 default gateway, and the addresses of both the DNS server and the WINS server.

 To learn the steps to configure a DHCP server in Windows, check out
 CertCam 4–8
 Exercise 4-8 in LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM. You can also watch the
 CertCam training video for this exercise, which demonstrates the steps.


Dns
 The Domain Name System (DNS) is a network service that is responsible for
 converting FQDNs to IP addresses so that communication can occur. Most
 networking applications allow users to type an FQDN (for example, www.
 gleneclarke.com) as the address of the system they want to communicate with. The
 FQDN must be converted to an IP address. DNS is responsible for converting this
 name to the IP address.
 Linux, Novell, and Microsoft Windows servers all contain DNS server software
 that can be installed to create the database of FQDNs and matching IP addresses.
 The Windows Server DNS Management tool is shown in Figure 4-15. To learn to
 install a Microsoft DNS server, take a look at the Exercise 4-9 on the CD-ROM.

 CertCam training video for this exercise, which demonstrates the steps.



Wins
 As you learned earlier in the chapter, the Windows Internet Naming Service
 (WINS) is used to resolve, or convert, NetBIOS names (computer names) to IP
 addresses. NetBIOS applications use NetBIOS names as a way to identify the remote
 system that the application is to communicate with. The NetBIOS name will be
 converted to the IP address by a WINS server.


nat/Pat/snat
 Most networks today are connected to the Internet, and having an Internet
 connection presents a number of security concerns. For example, if you have your
 server connected directly to the Internet, it will take no time at all for the system
 to be hacked. Network Address Translation (NAT) is a network service that is
 responsible for translating internal IP addresses from machines inside the network to
 a public address used by the NAT service—essentially hiding your internal network
 addresses. Figure 4-16 displays a typical NAT configuration.

 External interface

 Workstation A
 192.168.2.25 Network Services 209


 In Figure 4-16, you can see that the NAT server has two network interfaces
(cards): the internal interface and the external interface. The internal interface
has an IP address within the range of the internal network, whereas the external
interface uses an external address. Notice that the NAT server has two IP addresses
assigned and that the internal interface uses the IP address of 192.168.2.1. This will
be the default gateway address of all other systems on the network because the NAT
server is the way off the network.
 In Figure 4-16, when Workstation A wants to send information to the Internet, it
submits the request to the NAT server. The NAT server then modifies or translates
the source address of the packet to 24.138.38.202 so that the packet appears
to have come from the external interface of the NAT server. This is beneficial
because anyone who intercepts the data on the Internet will believe that the
packet came from the NAT server and not the internal computer on the LAN. As
a result, anyone who decides to attack the source of the packets will be attacking
the NAT server, which will typically be a firewall product as well; if the system is
compromised, however, at least it was only the NAT server, not one of the internal
systems that holds the company data!

Pat and snat
When implementing your NAT solution, you have a few options. You could have
each private address inside the network translate to a single public address that
is associated with the public interface. This would mean that you need to have
multiple public addresses in order to create the one-to-one mapping by which one
private IP address translates to one public IP address.
 If you only have one public IP address on the NAT device and need to use that
for all private addresses on the LAN, then you will need to overload the public
address with multiple private addresses. NAT overloading is used when each of the
private IP addresses is translated to the one public IP address, essentially overloading
the poor public address.
 The big question is “How does the NAT device know which internal system to
send the response to when data is returned from the Internet?” This is an important
question because all of the packets will be returned to whatever the public address
is on the NAT device. This is where Port Address Translation (PAT) comes in. If
you look at Figure 4-17, you will see that the NAT device using port addressing is
keeping track of not only the IP address of the system sending outbound traffic, but
also the port used by the application on the private system. The source address of
the outbound packet is converted from the IP address of the private system to the 210 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals

 IP address of the public interface on the NAT device. Also, the port used by the
 application on the sending computer is then converted to a unique port address used
 by the NAT device. All IP addresses and port addresses are then stored in the NAT
 table, known as the port address table, and then the packet is sent to destination
 system on the Internet.
 When a response comes back from the Internet destined for a port on the NAT
 device, the packet is then translated to use the original private IP address and port
 number of the original source system. After the header of the packet is replaced with
 original IP and port information, the NAT device then sends the data to the internal
 system.
 Another term you will see that deals with NAT is Secure Network Address
 Translation, or SNAT. Some NAT devices include proxy features as well. These
 features give you the opportunity to configure different types of clients for the NAT
 device; for example, you could configure all the clients as proxy clients, or secure
 NAT clients.
 If you install proxy client software on the client systems, then the clients can use
 the NAT device as their method to get out to the Internet and you can leverage
 features such as authentication. If you decide you do not want to install the proxy
 client software but simply want to use the NAT features of the proxy server, then you Network Services 211


 can simply set the default gateway of all the clients to point to the private IP address
 of the NAT device. All client systems will then send outbound communication to
 the NAT device, which will then translate the source address as normal. A SNAT
 solution that does not have client software installed on the stations of the users can
 leverage features such as application filters but cannot authenticate the users.


iCs
 Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a service built into Windows operating
 systems that allows you to share your Internet connection with other users on the
 network. ICS acts as a NAT server and a DHCP server at the same time. When you
 enable ICS in Windows, it automatically starts assigning IP addresses out on the
 network so that the DHCP clients use the ICS computer as their default gateway.
 When clients send information to the ICS machine to be sent on the Internet, the
 ICS machine translates the source address (the NAT feature) to use the external
 interface of the system.
 To enable ICS, right-click your Internet LAN connection and choose Properties.
 On the Advanced page tab, select “Allow other network users to connect through
 this computer’s Internet connection” (shown in Figure 4-18) and then choose OK.

sMb
 The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, used primarily by Microsoft operating
 systems, is responsible for sharing files and printers on a system and making those
 resources available to SMB clients on the network. SMB is an application-layer
 protocol that runs on top of TCP/IP, IPX, and NetBEUI and relies on those
 protocols for transport functionality.




 SMB is a term that is being are protocols responsible for allowing
 phased out. Microsoft is now using the access to a remote file system as if it were
 term Common Internet File System (CIFS) stored on the local system in a Microsoft
 instead of SMB. Either way, SMB and CIFS environment.




nfs
 Microsoft environments use SMB; the Network File System (NFS) is a protocol
 developed by Sun Microsystems that allows users to access files stored on a remote
 system as if it were a local resource.
 NFS is the equivalent of SMB used in UNIX and Linux environments and is
 platform independent, meaning that the NFS client may be accessing a file system
 resource from any type of server that is an NFS server—not just a Linux server.
 NFS uses an interface that runs on top of
 TCP/IP networks called the Virtual File System
 (VFS), which is responsible for making the
 resource available to a local application. The
 NFS is a file-sharing local application makes the call to the resource
 protocol used in UNIX and Linux as if it were a local resource, and the application
 environments; SMB is the file-sharing never learns that the resource is on a remote
 protocol in Microsoft environments. system—NFS makes the location and platform
 of the remote resource transparent to the
 application and users. Network Services 213


afP
 If SMB is the file-sharing protocol in Microsoft environments and NFS is the file-
 sharing protocol in UNIX environments, what is responsible for allowing access to
 files on remote systems in the Macintosh world? You guessed it; the AppleTalk Filing
 Protocol (AFP) is responsible for allowing Macintosh systems to access remote file
 systems on an AppleTalk network.
 Original implementations of AFP only ran on top of AppleTalk networks,
 but newer versions of AFP run on top of TCP/IP because of the popularity of the
 protocol. Like SMB and NFS, AFP provides an environment that allows users to
 access files on a remote system as if they were on the local system. AFP also provides
 security as to who accesses the file.


samba
 Samba is an application environment that runs on Linux systems and uses SMB to
 allow Microsoft clients to access the Samba-enabled UNIX servers as if they were
 Microsoft servers. A Samba-enabled UNIX server may provide a number of services
 to Microsoft clients, including

 n Sharing the file system of the UNIX server to Microsoft clients
 n Sharing printer resources from the UNIX environment to Microsoft clients
 n Performing authentication and authorization services to Microsoft clients

 This may not sound like a very exciting
 feature, but it has proven to be a very exciting
 technology because without it, the Microsoft
 Samba is a network clients would only be able to access the
 service loaded on UNIX/Linux systems Microsoft servers in your organization and not
 that implements SMB services so that the UNIX servers. The reason is that UNIX
 Microsoft clients can access files and servers use NFS as a file-sharing protocol,
 printers on the UNIX/Linux servers. while Microsoft uses SMB—so Samba gives
 you the best of both worlds because it allows
 the UNIX server to run its NFS protocol for
 UNIX clients while Samba provides the SMB
 service for Microsoft clients. Both types of clients can now share resources with
 one another! Figure 4-19 shows an example of configuring Samba with Webmin
 tools in Linux. 214 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals

 UNIX uses two different services, called daemons, to provide Samba services:

 n smbd daemon This daemon provides the core services of Samba, offering
 file-and-print services functionality from the UNIX server to Windows
 clients. The smbd daemon also provides authentication and authorization
 services to Windows clients.
 n nmbd daemon This daemon is loaded on the UNIX server to provide
 WINS services and network browsing functionality so that the Samba servers
 appear in My Network Places on Windows clients.

ZeroConfig
 Zero Configuration Networking (ZeroConfig) is a network service designed to
 minimize the configuration of the network clients by broadcasting configured
 services on the network to network clients who automatically discover
 these network services. After the service has been discovered, the client is
 automatically configured to use this service with no interaction from the
 network administrator.

 In this chapter you learned the fundamentals of TCP/IP and what makes this
 protocol so common in today’s networking market. The following list summarizes
 what you learned about TCP/IP:

 n The IP address and subnet mask are the most important configuration
 settings and must be specified correctly in order to communicate on the
 TCP/IP-based network. Next in importance is the default gateway, which
 specifies where to route packets if you are communicating outside the local
 network.
 n The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically configures
 a workstation with the correct TCP/IP settings, relieving you of the burden of
 manually configuring every workstation.
 n The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for Internet-based machines
 and company intranets that use DNS for hostname resolution. You learned
 about the hostname, domain name, resolution, and Internet domain name
 server hierarchies.
 n The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS), which ironically has little
 to do with the Internet, enables workstations to resolve NetBIOS names to
 IP addresses rather than using a static LMHOSTS file on each machine.
 n TCP/IP is a suite of protocols, the most popular of which are TCP, UDP, IP,
 and ARP. (Your Network+ exam will definitely have several questions on
 some of these TCP/IP protocol suite members.) 216 Chapter 4: TCP/IP Fundamentals



 n TCP/IP addressing involves a strong knowledge of the IP address, subnet
 mask, network classes, and special reserved addresses. (You should memorize
 each network class for the exam.)
 n The most important portions of TCP/IP as it relates to your Network+
 exam are the TCP/IP configuration concepts. You need these to configure
 workstations with TCP/IP. The concepts include the IP address, the subnet
 mask, DHCP, DNS, WINS, the default gateway, the hostname, and the
 NetBIOS name.

 With a strong understanding of the material presented in this chapter, you will
 have no problems with any TCP/IP-related questions on your exam. Not only is the
 material presented here important for the exam, but it will also be important after
 you ace the exam and continue on to a career as a networking professional. Two-Minute Drill 217

 N ow that you have a handle on binary and TCP/IP addressing, you will learn in this
 chapter how to take one network address range and break it into multiple network
 ranges called subnets. Subnetting is one of those topics that most IT professionals
 tend to avoid because of how tedious it is to sit down and calculate the required information to
 configure your newly created subnets.

 The purpose of subnetting is take one address range that you have and break
 it down into multiple address ranges so that you can assign each address range to
 a separate network (subnet) in your internetwork (network made up of multiple
 networks). You may have multiple networks due to physical locations, or maybe you
 have one location, but because you want to cut down on traffic, you have decided
 to segment your one network into multiple network segments by placing a router in
 between each network segment.
 Each segment will need its own network address range so that the router can send
 data from one network to another. If you were to have two physical networks, but
 kept the one IP range without subnetting, the router would “logically” think that all
 systems are on the same network and would never try to route data from one side to
 the other.

 If you do not subnet a network range that is divided into multiple physical
 network segments, the IP protocol will “logically” think that all systems are
 on the same network, and it will not try to route the data across the router
 separating the network segments. As a result, you will be able to communicate
 with hosts on your segment but not the other segments.

Understanding subnetting
 In this section you will walk through a subnetting example using a class A address.
 The example is that you have an address range of 10.0.0.0 and you would like
 to subnet, or divide, the network into two subnetworks known as subnets. The
 physical network structure is shown in Figure 5-1. The concept of subnetting is Understanding Subnetting 231

 to take some of the host bits from the subnet mask and use them as additional
 network bits, which will give you more networks. With subnetting, you are taking
 additional host bits and “masking” them (flagging them as network bits) by setting
 the bits to a “1” so that they are no longer representing the host ID portion of the
 subnet mask. This creates additional networks but results in fewer hosts on the
 network.
 To begin, you need to know how many host bits to take to make the desired
 number of networks. A cheat way that does not involve much math is to look at
 the eight-bit binary table and then enable the bits that will give you the number
 of networks you are looking for. For example, you want to divide a class A address
 of 10.0.0.0 into two networks (be sure to remember that your goal is to have two
 networks), so you will enable the bits shown in the following table to come up with
 the decimal value of two.


 bit 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
 Value 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 State 1 232 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 Once you have mathematically enabled the bits that will give you the number
 of networks you are looking for, the next step is—from right to left—to turn off
 any bits that are not being used up to the last bit you have enabled. Once you
 have done that, you count the number of bits you have worked with from right to
 left. In the example, you will simply need to disable the first bit (far right side),
 and then count from right to left the number of bits that you have worked with.
 In the example, there are two bits that have been manipulated, so the number
 of bits that you need to create two networks is two. You can see the work in the
 following table:


 bit 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
 value 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 state 1 0


 You can mathematically verify that you have the correct number of bits you
 want to work with by using this formula: 2masked bits – 2 = number of networks. It was
 decided that two bits were needed to mask the subnet mask to do the subnetting; in
 checking your work by filling in the formula, you should have 22 – 2 = 2 networks.
 Having two networks was your goal, so you are on track!
 Now that you know that two bits must be masked to create the two subnets, the
 next step is to look at your IP range of 10.0.0.0 and ask yourself, “What is the default
 subnet mask of this address?” You should come up with 255.0.0.0, because it is a class
 A address. Once you know the default subnet mask, the next step is to break the
 subnet mask down into binary. A default class A subnet mask in binary looks like
 the following:


 Decimal 255 0 0 0
 binary 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000


 Once the subnet mask has been written out in binary, this will be the work area
 to calculate the new addresses of the two subnets. The first thing you need to do
 is steal, or “mask,” two bits from the host ID portion of the subnet mask and make
 them network bits by setting them to a “1” state. Remember, the reason for taking Understanding Subnetting 233


two bits is because of your calculation earlier. Because the last three octets of this
subnet mask represent the host bits of a class A address, work from left to right and
mask two additional bits to get the new binary table that follows:


 Decimal 255 0 0 0
 binary 11111111 11000000 00000000 00000000


 Notice that the two bits that are now enabled are in the second octet. Also notice
that you always work from left to right, except for that little cheat method you saw
earlier for calculating the number of bits required to mask. That cheat is just to get
the number of bits to work with—but once you actually work with the bits, you
always work from left to right.
 The next thing you want to do is convert all those octets to decimal values
again; then you will have the new subnet mask of the two networks (subnets)
we are building. If you convert the new binary value in the preceding table of
11111111.11000000.00000000.00000000, you should get 255.192.0.0 as the new
subnet mask of your two new subnets. Write that number down because it will be
needed later.
 The next step is to calculate the IP ranges for the two different networks, but
before that, you should be aware that there are five pieces of information you should
know about each network when your calculations are over. These five pieces of
information are

 n New subnet mask: After subnetting a network you will have a new subnet
 mask that is used by all subnets you have created.
 n Network ID: all host bits set to 0
 n First valid address: low-order host bit set to 1; all other host bits are 0
 n Broadcast address: all host bits set to 1
 n Last valid address: low-order host bit set to 0; all other host bits are 1

 You know that the new subnet mask is 255.192.0.0, so you can start by
calculating the network ID of each of the two subnets. To determine each piece of
information listed previously, you need to determine all of the on/off states of the
number of bits that you have stolen. For example, two bits were stolen to create 234 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 more networks, so there are four possible on/off states with two bits: 00, 01, 10,
 and 11. As calculated in your binary work area, it would look like the following
 table:


 first octet second octet third octet fourth octet
 (Decimal) (binary) (binary) (binary)

 original iP 10 0 0 0
 00000000 00000000 00000000

 10000000 00000000 00000000
 11000000 00000000 00000000


 The next thing to do after calculating all of the on/off state combinations of
 two bits is to add in the remaining 0s to the bits that represent the host ID portion.
 Remember that the original network ID was 10.0.0.0, so the first octet will start with
 10, no matter what you change in the binary, because you are starting your work
 with the second octet.
 After you fill in the host bits with all 0s, the next thing you need to do is to cross
 out the first and last lines; they are illegal, because the subnetted bits are all 0s and
 all 1s. With the two illegal addresses crossed out, there are only two lines remaining,
 each representing one of the two networks. This work is shown in the following
 table:


 first octet second octet third octet fourth octet
 (Decimal) (binary) (binary) (binary)

 original iP 10 0 0 0

 11000000 00000000 00000000 Understanding Subnetting 235


 The next step is to bring the 10 down to the first octet; each network ID will
 start with 10 because that is what it was originally. After bringing the 10 down
 in the first octet, you then calculate the network ID of each of the two networks
 by leaving all host bits set to 0 (the nonbolded bits) as shown in the following
 table:


 first octet second octet third octet fourth octet Calculation
 (Decimal) (binary) (binary) (binary)

original iP 10 0 0 0

 10 11000000 00000000 00000000



 In this example, because the two high-order bits are being set, there will
 be network IDs of 10.64.0.0 and 10.128.0.0. The next number, which can be
 calculated easily, is the first valid address that can be assigned to a host on each of
 these networks. To calculate the first valid address, you simply enable the lowest-
 order bit. The lowest-order bit will be the bit on the far right side. The work area
 is shown in the following table, and you can see that with the two networks you
 have a first valid address for each network of 10.64.0.1 and 10.128.0.1:


 first octet second octet third octet fourth octet Calculation
 (Decimal) (binary) (binary) (binary)

original iP 10 0 0 0
 10 00000000 00000000 00000000

 10 10000000 00000000 00000001 10.128.0.1
 10 11000000 00000000 00000000 236 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 Now that you have calculated the first valid address for each of the two networks,
 you will need to calculate the broadcast address. The broadcast address is the address
 that any system will send data to in order to ensure that each system on the network
 reads the data. To calculate the broadcast address, you will enable all of the host bits
 and get the outcome in the following table:



 first octet second octet third octet fourth Calculation
 (Decimal) (binary) (binary) octet
 (binary)

original iP 10 0 0 0
 10 00000000 00000000 00000000

 10 10111111 11111111 11111111 10.191.255.255
 10 11000000 00000000 00000000



 As you can see, with all the host bits enabled, if you convert that to decimal,
 you get 10.127.255.255 and 10.191.255.255 for the broadcast addresses of your two
 networks. Notice that the first two bits from the left in the second octet have not
 been changed in this entire process, but they are used in the conversion of that octet
 from binary to decimal.

 Remember that it is illegal to assign a host an address that has all host bits
 set to 0 or all host bits set to 1.These are illegal because all host bits set to
 0 is reserved for the network ID and all host bits set to 1 is reserved for the
 broadcast address.

 Now that you have calculated the new subnet mask, the network ID, the
 first valid address, and the broadcast address for your two new subnets, the
 only additional information you need is the last valid address that may be
 assigned to hosts on each subnet. To calculate the last valid host address of
 each subnet, simply subtract one from the broadcast address by disabling the
 low-order bit (the far right-most host bit). To view what the binary and decimal
 representation looks like for our last valid address of each network, take a look at
 the table at the top of the next page. Understanding Subnetting 237

 You have now calculated all of the information required to configure the two

 these two network segments will be configured.

subnetting a Class a address
 In this exercise you will determine the five pieces of information needed for a class
 A network that is being divided into four network segments.

 Question no. 1
 The network ID of the class A address is 120.0.0.0. Take a few pieces of paper and
 calculate the new subnet mask, the network ID, the first valid address, the last valid
 address, and the broadcast address of the four subnets. Once you have calculated
 your answer, fill in the following table. Refer to the subnetting example in this

 the Work
 Given that we want to have four subnets, we will need to take three bits; to verify
 that answer we enable the bits in our temp work area to get the number 4 and
 then count the bits from right to left that are used to get to that last enabled bit.
 00000100 gives us the number 4, and we have used 4 bits from right to left to get
 that value. We can also use our formula of 2masked bits – 2 = number of networks to
 verify that the number is correct, which means we get a formula of 23 – 2 = 6. We Understanding Subnetting 239


get six networks, and we require only four networks. This just means that we have
two extra networks that will not be used. If we were to use only two bits, we would
have only two networks.
 The next thing to calculate is the new subnet mask used by these four new networks.
The new subnet mask is determined by masking additional bits in the original subnet
mask. The original subnet mask was 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000, and by
masking three additional bits, we get the following:


 binary 11111111 11100000 00000000 00000000
 Decimal 255 224 0 0


 So your new subnet mask used by all six networks (we actually need only four
networks) is 255.224.0.0. Now that we have determined that we have to take
three bits, we then figure out all the on/off states of three bits. The following
should be the on/off states of three bits. (I have also filled in all the host bits at
the same time.)

 Once you have figured out each of the on/off states of three bits and have filled in
the host bits of all 0s, you have the network ID for each of the six networks. If you 240 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 convert the binary to decimal, you should have the following as the network ID of
 each subnet:

 Now that you have done all the paperwork, you should have come up with the
 following answer for the first four subnets of the 120.0.0.0 network: 242 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing

Your manager has purchased a class C network range and has asked that you subnet
this class C network into two subnets for the two network segments that are going

 catches people, because they do not see a 255 as the broadcast address, or a 0 as the

 This section has introduced you to the concept of subnetting, which you
 will need to know for the Network+ exam. So make sure you are familiar with
 identifying the class addresses and then have a solid understanding of subnetting!

 Be sure to check out the exercises in LabBook.pdf found on the CD-ROM for

CertifiCation objeCtive 5.02


Classful vs. Classless addressing
 Chapter 4 focused on introducing you to the different class IP addresses: class A,
 class B, and class C. Each IP address that you use on a system falls into one of these
 three classes—this is known as classful addressing. Table 5-1 summarizes the three
 major address classes.


 tabLe 5-1 address Class value of first octet setup number of Host
 octet
Reviewing
Classful IP Class A 1–127 N.H.H.H 16,777,214
Addressing Class B 128–191 N.N.H.H 65,534
 Class C 192–223 N.N.N.H 254


 Everything that you have learned about the different address classes, including
 network IDs, host IDs, and default subnet masks, is based on classful addressing.




 Classful IP addressing For example, a class B address uses the first
 divides the network ID and host ID two octets as the network ID and the last
 portions of an IP address at an octet. two octets as the host ID.



CiDr
 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), or classless addressing, is the idea of not
 following the default concepts of classful addressing. For example, if you wish
 to break your class A address down into more than one network and subnet the
 network, then you are creating a variable-length subnet mask. A variable-length
 subnet mask (VLSM) is a subnet mask that does not follow the defaults of address
 classes but simply specifies which bits in the IP address are part of the network ID
 by setting the corresponding bit in the subnet mask to a 1. 246 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing




 With the concept of variable-length subnet masks, there needed to be a
 standard method of indicating how many bits in the IP address were network
 bits, so the concept of Classless Inter-Domain
 Routing (CIDR) notation was created. With
 CIDR notation, you specify the IP address and
 a / followed by the number of bits that make

 bits (which would mean the subnet masks is
 255.0.0.0).


supernetting
 Supernetting, like subnetting, is part of the CIDR concept where we are altering
 the default way the IP address scheme works. You learned earlier that the goal of
 subnetting was to take bits from the host ID portion of an address to create more
 networks (subnets). Supernetting works the opposite way: you take bits away from
 the network ID to combine networks. The goal of supernetting is to combine
 multiple smaller networks into one big network ID.



CertifiCation objeCtive 5.03


Understanding routing
 Now that you have an understanding of subnetting, the next topic to discuss is
 routing. Routing is the concept of sending data from one network to another. Once
 we have the network broken into segments, it is up to the routers to route the data
 from one network segment to another, as shown in Figure 5-3.
 The router is responsible for routing information to the destination network,
 and it does this by using what is known as a routing table. A routing table is a list
 of destination networks that resides in memory on the router, and the router uses
 this to identify where to send data to reach the destination. If the destination is
 not in the routing table, the router will not be able to send the information to the
 destination, as shown in Figure 5-3. Understanding Routing 247


figUre 5-3 A router depends on its routing table for knowledge of destination networks.


Hey Router A, can you send routing table
some data to the 192.168.4.0 Destination Gateway Interface

 Server
 192.168.3.200



 If you take a look at Figure 5-3, you can see that COMPUTERA is trying to send
 data off the network by sending it to ROUTERA. ROUTERA looks in its routing
 table to see whether the destination of 192.168.4.0 is listed, and as you can see in the
 figure, the router does not know how to reach that destination, so it returns an error.
 Let’s look at the routing table in the figure and learn how to read it. If you
 take a look at the third entry in the routing table of ROUTERA, you can see
 that ROUTERA has an entry for the 192.168.3.0 network. If any systems on the
 192.168.1.0 network send data to the 192.168.3.0 network, the router will send the
 information to the “gateway” value of that entry. The gateway is where the router
 needs to send the data to reach that particular destination. In this case, it will send
 the data to 192.168.2.2, and it will get to 192.168.2.2 by sending the data out the
 interface of 192.168.2.1 on ROUTERA. The interface column is important because
 it lets the router know how that gateway can be reached from ROUTERA.


Cisco routers
 The most popular vendor that supplies routers is Cisco. Cisco routers are used to
 connect networks together and route data between these networks. A Cisco router
 connects to different networks by having network cards, known as interfaces,
 built into the router. Each interface is assigned an IP address and is connected to a
 network (as shown back in Figure 5-3). 248 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 Let’s assume that ROUTERA and ROUTERB in Figure 5-3 are Cisco routers.
 Also, we will assume that on ROUTERA the interface assigned the IP address of
 192.168.1.1 is an Ethernet interface (which connects to an Ethernet network). We
 will also assume that the interface on ROUTERA that is assigned the IP address of
 192.168.2.1 is a serial interface. Serial interfaces are used either to connect to your
 WAN or to serve as a point-to-point link (a direct connection between two routers).

 assigning iP addresses to Cisco routers
 To assign an IP address to the Ethernet interface on ROUTERA, you will need to
 type the following commands (excluding what appears before&gt;or #—those are the
 prompts):
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# interface ethernet0
 ROUTERA(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 ROUTERA(config-if)# no shutdown

 Let’s take a look at what each of these commands do. The first command, enable,
 is used to move from user exec mode of the router to privilege exec mode. In user
 exec mode you are unable to make changes, so you had to go to privilege exec mode.
 In order to change the settings of the Ethernet interface, you need to go to the
 interface prompt, which is in global configuration, where most changes are made.
 To move to global configuration, you typed configure terminal, and to move to
 the interface prompt, you typed interface ethernet0. Ethernet0 is the first Ethernet
 interface on the router; the second Ethernet interface would be Ethernet1 (if you
 had a second Ethernet interface).
 Once at the Ethernet interface prompt, you then assigned the IP address with the
 ip address command. The last command, no shutdown, is used to enable the interface.
 To disable the interface at any time, you could use the shutdown command.
 To assign the IP address to the Serial 0 port on ROUTERA, you would type the
 following commands:
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# interface serial0
 ROUTERA(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ROUTERA(config-if)# encapsulation hdlc
 ROUTERA(config-if)# no shutdown Understanding Routing 249


 Note that the commands are pretty much the same, except for the fact that we
navigate to the Serial0 interface instead of the Ethernet0 interface. After the IP
address is assigned with the ip address command, you then set the encapsulation
protocol for the serial link. Popular encapsulation protocols over a serial link are
HDLC or PPP. You need to ensure you are using the same protocol that is on the
other end of the serial link.

viewing the routing table on Cisco routers
Once you have the IP addresses assigned to each interface, you will need to ensure
that routing is enabled on the router by typing the following commands:
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# ip routing

The ip routing command is used to enable routing on the router. Should you wish
to disable routing on the router, you would then type the no ip routing command.
 Once routing has been enabled, the router will automatically add a route for each
of the networks it is directly connected to. To view the routing table and verify that
the routes are added, type
 ROUTERA&gt;show ip route

If you have a look at Figure 5-4, you will notice that the show ip route command
was typed and the routing table is displayed. Notice in the figure that the route
to the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks is automatically added because the
router is connected to those networks. You will also notice a letter C to the left of
each route entry, which means that the route is there because the router is directly
connect to the network.

adding a route to Cisco routers
When administering a Cisco router, you will need to add routes for routes that do
not exist in the routing table. For example, looking back to Figure 5-4, ROUTERA
knows about the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks but not the 192.168.3.0
network. If you want to configure ROUTERA so that it knows about the
192.168.3.0 network, you will need to add the route manually by typing
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2 250 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing




 figUre 5-4

Looking at the

 In this code listing the command is ip route (shown in Figure 5-5) to add a route
 to the routing table. The 192.168.3.0 is the address of the destination network
 you are adding and its subnet mask, while
 192.168.2.2 is the address that ROUTERA is
 to send information to that is destined for the
 192.168.3.0 network. Notice that 192.168.2.2
 is the address of an interface on ROUTERB

 via the interface at 192.168.2.2, which will
 then send the data onto the 192.168.3.0
 network.
 If you view the routing table with the show ip route command, you will
 notice that you have routes in the routing table that are there because the router
 is connected to that network, and you will notice the static routes, which are
 indicated with a letter S. Figure 5-6 displays the new routing table with the static
 route added. Understanding Routing 251

 Deleting a route on a Cisco router
 It was pretty easy to add a route to the Cisco router with the ip route command, and
 it is just as easy to delete a route with the no ip route command. To delete a route
 from the routing table, use the following syntax:
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# no ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 252 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing




Windows routers
 It is important to understand that because the IP protocol is running on your
 Windows computer, it has a built-in routing table as well. The built-in routing table
 is used by Windows to determine how to send data.
 It is also important to note that it is possible to take a Windows server and install
 routing features on it so that it routes data from one network to another. In order to
 do this, you will need to have two network cards, each acting like an interface on a
 real router.
 Once you have both network cards installed and have assigned IP addresses
 to them, you can then enable the Windows Routing feature by going to Start
 | Administrative Tools | Routing And Remote Access. Once the Routing and
 Remote Access (RRAS) console is started, you then must enable Routing and
 Remote Access by right-clicking your server in the left side of the window and
 then choosing Configure And Enable Routing And Remote Access. This will
 launch the wizard that will allow you to enable the routing feature of a Windows
 server. In the RRAS Setup Wizard, you will need to choose Custom Configuration
 and then choose Next. When you reach the screen asking which services you wish
 to install, select LAN Routing (shown in Figure 5-7); then press Next and Finish
 the wizard.


 figUre 5-7

Enabling LAN
Routing on a

 Once you have enabled LAN Routing in Routing and Remote Access, you can
 then perform tasks such as viewing your routing table, adding routes, or deleting
 routes by right-clicking Static Routes and choosing the appropriate command shown
 in Figure 5-8. You can also use a number of commands in Windows to manage your
 routing table, which is what the next few sections cover.

 viewing Your routing table
 Because you have TCP/IP installed on your system and the IP protocol uses a
 routing table to determine the pathway to destination networks, each system
 running TCP/IP has a routing table. If you wish to view your system’s routing table,
 you can type the following command in a command prompt:
 route print

 The route print command displays the routing table of your local system, and you
 should have output similar to that shown in Figure 5-9. Let’s look at the contents of
 the output of the route print shown in Figure 5-9. You can see that there is a route
 for the 127.0.0.0 network, which is reserved for the loopback test. Notice that any
 messages sent to the entire network address of 127.0.0.0 are sent to the localhost
 address of 127.0.0.1 (specified in the gateway column).
 You will also notice that there is a route for the 192.168.1.0 network. This is
 actually the network that this system is plugged into. Therefore, in order for this system
 to send data to the network, it simply sends data to the 192.168.1.200 address (which
 is its own network card). You will also notice that there is a route for the 224.0.0.0
 network address range, which is the class D range used by multicasting applications.

 figUre 5-9

 Looking at Figure 5-9, you will also notice that there are two entries for broadcast
 addresses. The first entry is 192.168.1.255, which is the broadcast address for the
 192.168.1.0 network segment; there is also a broadcast address for all network
 segments, which is known as the 255.255.255.255 address. The 255.255.255.255
 address is known as an internetwork broadcast address, and clients can use it to send
 data to all systems on all subnets, not just their own subnets.

 adding a route
 Let’s assume that Figure 5-9 is displaying the routing table of ROUTERA, which
 was shown in the network diagram of Figure 5-3. In this routing table, we don’t
 have a route for the 192.168.3.0 network, so you will learn how to add a route to
 the routing table. To add a route to your routing table, you can use the route add
 command. The syntax to use the route add command is as follows:
 route add&lt;destination IP&gt;MASK&lt;subnet mask&gt;&lt;gateway address&gt;In our example, you would like to add a route for the destination address of
 192.168.3.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The gateway address is where your
 system will send the data so that it can reach the destination. If you were adding the
 route to ROUTERA found in Figure 5-3, you would send to the gateway (how to
 reach the destination) of 192.168.2.2. Our command is typed as
 route add 192.168.3.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2 Understanding Routing 255


 Once you have typed this command into ROUTERA, you can verify that the
 route has been added by typing the route print command again at the command
 prompt. Figure 5-10 displays both the addition of the route and the routing table
 after the route has been added.




 For the Network+ exam use the route add command and to view your
 know that in Windows to add a route you routing table you use the route print command.




 Deleting a route
 You may delete a route from the routing table at any time by using the route
 delete command. The route delete command uses one parameter—the destination
 route that you wish to delete from the routing table. If you wanted to delete the
 192.168.3.0 network from your routing table, the syntax for the route delete
 command is as follows:
 route delete 192.168.3.0

Dynamic routing Protocols
 Managing the entries in router routing tables on a large internetwork could be
 a time-consuming task. To help router administrators manage the routing table
 of routers throughout the internetwork, the routers could have dynamic routing
 protocols enabled. Dynamic routing protocols are protocols enabled on routers that
 allow them to share information contained within their routing tables with one
 another. As a result, routes that are known by one router will be shared with the
 other routers, thus saving the router administrator from having to add all the routes
 on all the routers!
 The term used for when all the routes on the network are merged into each
 router’s routing table is convergence. Convergence occurs when all routing tables
 have been shared with all other routers and all
 routers have updated their routing table with
 that new information.
 When discussing the different routing
 Convergence is when the
 protocols, it is important to note that there are
 routes on each router are shared with
 two major classes of routing protocols, distance

 either a distance vector protocol or a link state
 protocol.


Distance vector
 Distance vector routing protocols measure the best route to use based on the lowest
 hop count. The hop count is increased by one for every router between the source
 and the destination. With distance vector routing protocols, the route with the
 lowest hop count is typically selected as the destination path for the data.




 Examples of distance vector routing protocols are RIP and IGRP. Dynamic Routing Protocols 257


riP/riPv2
The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance vector protocol and is
responsible for sharing its routing table information with neighboring routers by
broadcasting the information over UDP every 30 seconds. This broadcasting of the
routing table is known as advertising, and advertising the routing table information
with neighboring routers exempts the network administrator from having to add the
routes manually.
 RIP is an industry-standard routing protocol, which means that it is supported
by many different vendors, so you could use it as a routing protocol to share routing
table information between routers from different manufacturers. RIP will choose
the route with the lowest hop count, but if two different routes have the same hop
count, RIP will load-balance the traffic over those two routes. Know that RIP is
limited to 15 hops, so it is used only on small networks.
 RIPv1 has the limitation that it only works with classful addresses because it
doesn’t send subnet mask information with the routing table. RIPv2 is an update
to RIPv1 and does support classless addressing and variable-length subnet masks
because it sends the subnet mask information with the routing table.
 Let’s assume you are the administrator for ROUTERA shown back in Figure 5-3.
ROUTERA will have routes to the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks by default.
If you wanted to configure RIP on ROUTERA to advertise knowledge of those two
networks, you would type the following commands on ROUTERA (remember not to
type what is before the&gt;and # because they are the prompts that would appear on
the screen):
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# router rip
 ROUTERA(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
 ROUTERA(config-router)# network 192.168.2.0

 Once RIP, or any other routing protocol, has been enabled on both ROUTERA
and ROUTERB, the two routers will then share knowledge of any networks they
know about. When ROUTERA receives knowledge of the 192.168.3.0 network
and builds the new network into its routing table, this is known as convergence.
Figure 5-11 displays the routing table on ROUTERA after RIP has been enabled
on both routers. Notice the letter R beside the 192.168.3.0 route, meaning that the
route was learned through RIP. 258 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing

 igrP
 Another example of a distance vector routing protocol is the Interior Gateway
 Routing Protocol (IGRP). IGRP is a classful routing protocol that was built by Cisco,
 so you will only use it on networks where you have only Cisco routers.
 IGRP was designed to improve on RIP limitations; it has a maximum hop count
 of 255 and uses the concepts of an autonomous system (AS). An autonomous system
 is a grouping of routers that share routing table information. Routers using IGRP will
 only share the routes with other routers in the AS. Another improvement is that the
 full routing table is advertised every 90 seconds instead of 30 seconds as is the case
 with RIP.
 To enable IGRP on your Cisco router, you type the following commands:
 ROUTERA&gt;enable
 ROUTERA# configure terminal
 ROUTERA(config)# router igrp 10
 ROUTERA(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
 ROUTERA(config-router)# network 192.168.2.0

 In this code listing you will notice that to
 enable IGRP on a Cisco router is similar to
 enabling RIP. The difference is that when you
 RIP and IGRP are enable IGRP, you specify the AS number for the
 examples of distance vector routing router. In this case I have used 10, so any other
 protocols. router with an AS number of 10 will receive
 routing information for the 192.168.1.0 and
 192.168.2.0 networks. Dynamic Routing Protocols 259


 bgP
 The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is known as an exterior gateway protocol
 that is responsible for sharing routing table information with routers outside your
 autonomous system. The protocols discussed before this are known as interior
 gateway protocols that are responsible for sharing routing tables within your
 autonomous system (or network).
 BGP is designed to send changes made to the routing table when the change
 occurs versus at a regular interval like RIP. BGP only sends the change, while other
 routing protocols such as RIP send the entire table. BGP is also a classless routing
 protocol that supports CIDR.

 BGP is a newer version of the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).



Link state
 Link state routing protocols are a little more advanced than distance vector routing
 protocols in the sense that a link state routing protocol knows about the entire
 network topology. A link state protocol is responsible for monitoring the state of
 the link between the routers. This link state information is then used to determine
 the optimal route to a destination network. Although protocols such as RIP have
 knowledge of neighboring routers, link state protocols have knowledge of the entire
 network topology and multicast the routing table information to the entire network.
 One of the benefits of the link state routing protocols is that if a link is down,
 that information is stored in the routing table and that pathway will not be used.
 Because a distance vector routing protocol does not store link state information, it is
 possible that it will not know of a link that is unavailable for some time and it could
 still send traffic through that pathway.

 osPf
 Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is an example of a link state protocol. OSPF is
 an industry-standard protocol, which means that it is available to routers built by
 different manufacturers and you can use it as a protocol to share routing information
 between the dissimilar routers.
 Like IGRP, OSPF uses autonomous systems, but it also has the capability of
 dividing the AS into logical groups called areas. OSPF supports VLSM and has an
 unlimited hop count. 260 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing



 is-is
 The intermediate system–to–intermediate system (IS-IS) routing protocol competes
 with OSPF by being a link state routing protocol for inside the network (interior
 gateway). IS-IS was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and has
 become an industry-standard protocol, although
 not as popular as OSPF.
 Like OSPF, IS-IS uses a link state algorithm
 to maintain status information on all the links
 OSPF and IS-IS are and routes on the network so that each router
 examples of link state routing protocols. running the IS-IS protocol will have knowledge
 of the entire network topology.


Hybrid
 There are hybrid routing protocols that combine the features of distance vector and
 link state. A popular hybrid routing protocol that was built by Cisco is the Enhanced
 Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), which improves upon IGRP by being
 a classless routing protocol that supports VLSM and supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
 EIGRP also has a maximum hop count of 255 hops.




 EIGRP is an example of a hybrid routing protocol.

 In this chapter you have learned more about the TCP/IP protocol and some of its
 functionality, such as subnetting and routing. You have learned that from time to
 time you may need to divide a network range into multiple network blocks (subnets)
 to follow the physical structure of the network. You have also learned that the IP
 protocol uses a routing table to determine how to deliver data to its destination.
 This chapter has also discussed routing protocols, and you have learned the
 difference between a distance vector routing protocol and a link state routing
 protocol. Two-Minute Drill 261

 Understanding subnetting
 q The purpose of subnetting is to break one network ID into multiple subnetworks
 (subnets) so that you can follow the physical structure of the network.
 q With subnetting you take host bits from the subnet mask and mask them to be
 network bits—thus creating more networks but fewer machines per network.
 q To determine how many bits to take from the host ID portion of the subnet
 mask, use the formula 2masked bits – 2 = number of networks.
 q Remember to calculate the network ID, first valid address, last valid address,
 broadcast address, and new subnet mask of each subnet created.

 Classful vs. Classless addressing
 q Classful addressing is when the network ID falls into one of the default network
 IDs of either a class A, class B, or class C address.
 q Classless addressing is when the network ID is altered from a normal classful
 address.

 Understanding routing
 q The IP protocol is responsible for routing data to its destination.
 q You can view your routing table with route print.
 q You may add a route to a routing table with route add.
 q You may delete a route from the routing table with route delete.
 q You may use a dynamic routing protocol such as RIP or OSPF so that the
 routers share routing table information with one another, eliminating the need
 to manually configure the routes individually.

 Dynamic routing Protocols
 q There are two major types of routing protocols, distance vector and link state.
 q Distance vector routing protocols share routing information with neighboring
 routers and measure the best route by how many hops away a destination is.
 q Link state routing protocols share routing information with all routers on the
 network and include information on the state of the link.
 q RIP and IGRP are examples of distance vector routing protocols.
 q OSPF and IS-IS are examples of link state routing protocols. 262 Chapter 5: Subnetting and Routing

 operating system that you are using. This also means that the utilities may vary slightly,
 depending on the operating system being used. For example, to view your TCP/IP setting on a
 Windows server, you would use IPCONFIG, whereas on a Linux box you would use ifconfig—each
 of which may support different command-line switches. Although these utilities generally provide
 very basic functions, they will prove to be invaluable when troubleshooting network problems.

 In the first part of this chapter, we discuss the most commonly used TCP/IP

CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.01


ARP
 As discussed in Chapter 3, network interface cards (NICs) have a hardware address,
 or MAC address, burned into the network card itself. When you communicate from
 one system to another, you normally are familiar with the IP address of the host
 with which you want to communicate, but underneath the hood, the systems must
 use the physical MAC address to send and receive data—the problem being, how ARP 269


 does one system find out the MAC address of the other system so that it can send
 the data across the network? The answer—ARP. The Address Resolution Protocol
 (ARP) was designed to provide a mapping from the logical TCP/IP addresses to the
 physical MAC addresses.
 Address resolution is the process of resolving addresses or converting from one
 type of address to another. In the case of ARP, the logical address (layer-3 address)
 is being converted to the MAC address (layer-2 address) by a broadcast out on the
 network. With ARP, the sending computer yells out on the network, “Whoever has
 this IP address, I need your MAC address!” This broadcast is sent out on the wire,
 and every host looks at the broadcast data. The host with that IP address will reply
 with its MAC address. The address resolution process is complete once the original
 computer has received the MAC address information of the destination system, and
 is then able to send data, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 ARP maintains the protocol rules for making this translation and providing
 address conversion in both directions, from a layer-3 address to a layer-2 address
 (ARP), and from a layer-2 address to a layer-3 address (Reverse ARP) as shown in
 Figure 6-2. A utility by the same name is available for Windows- and Linux-based

 operating systems. This utility is used to display and modify entries within the ARP
 cache, which is where the addresses that have been resolved are stored for future
 reference. ARP is defined in-depth in RFC 826.




 Remember that ARP Reverse ARP (RARP) is used to translate
 translates the IP address (layer-3 address) the MAC address to the IP address.
 to the MAC address (layer-2 address).




How ARP Works
 When a host wants to send data out on the network, the ARP protocol is tasked
 to find a MAC address that matches the IP address for the destination computer.
 The ARP protocol first looks inside its ARP cache table for the appropriate address.
 If the address is found, the destination MAC address is then added to the data
 packet and forwarded. If no entry exists in the ARP cache for the destination IP
 address, ARP broadcasts an ARP request packet to all the machines on the LAN to
 determine the MAC address of the machine that has that IP address. The host with
 that IP address will send an ARP reply that contains its MAC address, whereas all
 other hosts do not reply, because they do not have the IP address specified in the
 ARP request. ARP 271


 If the destination is on a remote subnet, the address of the router or gateway used
 to reach that subnet is ARPed. If the ARP cache does not contain an IP address for
 the router or gateway, the sending computer will ARP the IP address of the router.
 Once the MAC address is determined by the ARP reply, the IP and MAC address
 of the destination system are stored in the ARP cache (stored in memory) so that
 next time the address will be resolved from the cache and a broadcast will not be
 needed.
 As protocols go, ARP provides very basic functionality; there are only four types
 of messages that can be sent out by the ARP protocol, which are as follows:

 ■ ARP request
 ■ ARP reply
 ■ RARP request
 ■ RARP reply


ARP Cache
 To reduce the number of address resolution broadcasts, thereby minimizing network
 utilization, a client caches resolved addresses for a short time in a table in memory.
 This table, known as the ARP cache, is used to maintain the mappings between
 each MAC address and its corresponding IP address locally. This is the most
 important part of this protocol. Since the size of the ARP cache is limited, entries
 need to be purged periodically. If they are not, the cache could become huge in size
 and could contain quite a few obsolete entries. Therefore, ARP cache entries are
 removed at predefined intervals. This process also removes any unsuccessful attempts
 to contact computers that are not currently running.
 Entries in the ARP cache can be viewed, added, or deleted by using the ARP
 utility. Entries that are added with this utility manually are called static entries
 and will not expire out of cache, whereas the entries that are added automatically
 through broadcast are known as the dynamic entries and will expire from the cache.
 Being able to view the ARP cache can be helpful in trying to resolve address
 resolution problems. By displaying the current cache, you can determine whether
 a host’s MAC address is being resolved correctly.
 To view the ARP cache, type the following command in a command prompt
 window and press retne :
 arp -a

 Figure 6-3 shows an example of an ARP cache. 272 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




 FIGURE 6-3

Viewing the ARP
cache with arp -a




 Customizing the ARP Cache
 Additional options are available to customize the information found in the ARP
 cache. For example, you can filter the entries displayed when you list them with
 ARP. When you append the appropriate IP address after the -a switch, the table will
 list entries only for that particular IP address, as shown in Figure 6-4. This can be
 useful when trying to isolate specific entries in a large table.
 Type the following command, and press retne to view the ARP cache for a
 specific IP address:
 arp -a&lt;IP address&gt;Computers that contain multiple NICs or multihomed computers have more
 than one network interface listed, and the ARP cache maintains addresses for each
 interface independently. When you use the ARP -a option, all network interfaces will
 be listed. To filter the display by a specific interface, use the -n option. This enables
 you to specify which interface to display addresses for, as shown in Figure 6-5.
 Type the following command, and press retne to view the ARP cache for a
 specific interface:
 arp -a -n&lt;interface&gt;To learn more about ARP, check out Exercise 6-1 and the CertCam training
 video for Exercise 6-1 on the CD-ROM.

 EXERCISE 6-1
 CertCam 6–1
Using ARP to See Your Local ARP Cache
 In this exercise you will view your ARP cache to view the MAC addresses of systems
 that you have communicated with. You will then ping the IP address of a system that
 does not appear in your ARP cache and verify that it was added to the cache. After
 viewing the ARP cache, you will analyze Ping traffic from a capture file and view the
 ARP request being sent on the network.

 1. Go to the command prompt by selecting Start | Run, and then type cmd.
 2. At the command prompt, type arp -a and press retne .
 3. Make a note of any entries that are in your ARP cache.
 4. Ping the IP address of a host on your network that was not in your ARP
 cache by typing ping&lt;ip address&gt;. In the accompanying illustration, notice
 that the address of 192.168.1.100 is pinged. 274 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 5. At the command prompt, type arp -a.
 6. Notice that the system that you have pinged is in the cache. This is because
 in order for any data to be sent to the target system, your system will
 need to know the MAC address of that system, and an ARP request went
 out to figure out the address; it was then stored in cache. You can see in
 the accompanying illustration that the address of 192.168.1.100 and the
 associated MAC address are stored in the cache.




 View ARP Traffic with Network Monitor
 In this part of the exercise you will open a packet capture made with Network
 Monitor, and you will analyze the traffic that occurs when you ping another system.
 Understand that Ping is just one example of communication between two systems
 and that no matter what type of communication occurs, the MAC address must be
 determined.

 7. Start Network Monitor from Start | Programs | Administrative Tools |
 Network Monitor. Open the packet capture called ping.cap from the Lab
 FilesPacketCaptures folder.
 8. Once you have the packet capture open, notice that there are 13 frames in
 the capture, as seen in the accompanying illustration. Further, by looking
 at the protocol column in the capture you can see that there are two ARP
 frames (frames 3 and 4). You can also see that frame 3 is the ARP request
 going out to the network, and frame 4 is the ARP reply coming back to the
 system. ARP 275




9. Frame 3 is the ARP request; we need to find out whom the request is for. Double-
 click frame 3 and expand the Ethernet section in the detail pane to determine
 the destination MAC address of the frame (shown in the accompanying
 illustration). Record the MAC address information in the space provided:
 Destination MAC Address: _____________________
 Source MAC Address: _________________________
 Ethernet Type: _______________________________ 276 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 10. You should have the following answers for the information collected
 previously. Notice that the destination MAC address is all Fs. This is the
 hardware address of a network broadcast—which is destined to “All” systems
 on the network.
 Destination MAC Address: __FFFFFFFFFFFF_____
 Source MAC Address: __000C296BDE4D_________
 Ethernet Type: ___Address Resolution Protocol____
 11. Double-click the last line in the detail pane (the ARP: Request line) as
 shown in the accompanying illustration. Notice that you have the sender’s
 hardware address, the sender’s protocol address, and the target computer’s
 IP address, and that the target computer’s hardware address is set to all
 0s—because it is unknown. That is what ARP is trying to figure out.




 12. Highlight frame 4 in the summary pane. This is the ARP reply. Double-click
 the ARP reply section of the frame in the detail pane to expand it (as shown ARP 277


 in the accompanying illustration). Notice that in the ARP section of the
 reply, you have the sender’s IP address and MAC address, along with the
 destination’s MAC address and IP address. The sender’s MAC address is what
 the initial system will use to send data to this host.




13. Record the following information:
 Source MAC Address: _________________________
 Source IP Address: ____________________________
 Destination MAC Address: _____________________
 Destination IP Address: ________________________
14. What is the MAC address of the system that was pinged (192.168.1.100)?
 _______________________________________
15. Close Network Monitor. 278 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Adding Static Entries
 When ARP broadcasts out on the network to resolve an address and then adds that
 entry to the ARP cache, it creates a dynamic entry. A dynamic entry is added and
 removed from the cache automatically. The systems administrator can add static
 entries to the ARP cache manually when necessary. This can be especially helpful
 when you have a computer that transfers large amounts of data to a remote host
 continually. By adding a static entry for the remote host into the computer’s ARP
 cache table, you determine that ARP broadcasts do not need to occur periodically,
 which minimizes network traffic. This option can also be used to test whether the
 local computer is receiving updates correctly.
 Suppose that you are trying to connect to another computer on the same
 network. You are unable to find the remote computer; however, the other machines
 around you seem to work fine. First, display
 the local ARP cache to determine whether the
 target host has an entry present in the ARP
 cache. If not, you can add a static entry into the
 ARP -a and ARP -g both ARP cache to allow you to determine whether
 display the contents of the ARP cache. the computer is properly receiving updates. If,
 with the new static entry placed in the cache,
 you notice that you can now connect to the
 remote computer, the problem was probably that the cache was not being updated
 correctly with the appropriate MAC address. Adding a static entry bypassed that
 problem, because you have forced the entry into the cache, which is checked first for
 ARP resolution.
 You can manually add entries with the following command:
 ARP -s&lt;IP address&gt;&lt;MAC address&gt;Deleting Static Entries
 You might need to delete entries that you have manually added or manually remove
 any entries that have been dynamically added to the ARP cache. Use the following
 command to delete an entry from the ARP cache:
 ARP -d&lt;IP Address&gt;ARP Cache Aging
 Unlike static addresses, which never age out, dynamic addresses remain for only a
 predetermined amount of time. The initial cache lifetime of entries is two minutes ARP 279


 on Windows systems, but Windows adjusts the size of the ARP cache automatically.
 If entries are reused within two minutes, they remain for ten minutes. A Registry
 parameter within Windows is also available to allow for more control over the aging
 parameters. The Registry parameter is located in the following location:
Hkey_Local_MachineSystemCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParametersArpCacheLife

 If the ArpCacheLife entry is not found in the TcpipParameters portion of
 the Registry, the default lifetime of two minutes (120 seconds) will be used. If
 you want to create the ArpCacheLife Registry entry, create a dword value named
 ArpCacheLife and set its value to a value in seconds.


RARP
 A little-known protocol exists to facilitate the reverse function of ARP. The Reverse
 Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) enables a machine to learn its own IP address
 by broadcasting to resolve its own MAC address. A RARP server containing these
 mappings can respond with the IP address for the requesting host. In most cases, a
 machine knows its own IP address; therefore, RARP is primarily used in situations
 such as diskless workstations or machines without hard disks. Dumb terminals and
 NetPCs are good examples of diskless workstations.
 To summarize, although ARP is a simple protocol compared to most other
 protocols, it is just as important as any other to TCP/IP for proper functionality. The
 utility included with this protocol (ARP) will enable you to display and modify the
 ARP cache as needed. This enables you to effectively troubleshoot any issues that
 might arise with ARP. Table 6-1 details the ARP switches and their corresponding
 definitions.


 TABLE 6-1 ARP Switch Definition
ARP Switches -a Displays the entire current ARP cache or a single entry by allowing
 you to specify the IP address of an adapter.
 -g Same as -a.
 -N Shows the ARP entries for a specified IP address and allows for
 modification.
 -d Deletes a specified entry or when used by itself it will clear the entire
 ARP cache.
 -s Adds an entry to the ARP cache by specifying a MAC address and an
 IP address. 280 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.02


Telnet
 Another utility commonly used is Telnet, a terminal emulation program. This utility
 was designed to provide a virtual terminal or remote login across the network to a
 Telnet-based application. This enables the user to execute commands on a remote
 machine from anywhere on the network as if he or she were sitting in front of the
 console. The term Telnet refers to both the protocol and the application used to
 create the remote session.
 Telnet was originally designed to allow for a single universal interface in a world
 that was very diverse. It was an efficient method of simulating a console session
 when very little else was available. It is still widely used for remotely administering
 devices such as network equipment and UNIX servers. It can also be a great
 troubleshooting tool when used correctly.


How Telnet Works
 The Telnet service uses TCP port 23 and is defined in depth in RFC 854. It is
 connection based and handles its own session negotiation, which makes it very
 efficient and effective. By maintaining its own protocol, it can set up its own sessions
 and manage them accordingly. This keeps the remote host from spending too much
 time processing requests and enables it to concentrate on its own processes. A
 client-based program is used to connect to the remote server, and the remote server
 must also be running a Telnet service to enable the client to connect.
 Telnet uses a concept known as network virtual terminal (NVT) to define
 both ends of a Telnet connection. Each end of the connection maintains a logical
 keyboard and printer. The logical keyboard
 generates characters, and the logical printer
 displays them. The logical printer is usually a
 terminal screen, and the logical keyboard is the

 user’s keyboard.


Using Telnet
 A Telnet client utility is included with most operating systems such as Windows
 and Linux. You can run the Telnet utility by typing telnet.exe at a command Telnet 281


 prompt in most operating systems. In some operating systems, such as Windows 9x,
 you will use the connect dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-6. You can enter either
 an IP address or a hostname. To connect via a hostname, the client must be able
 to resolve the name to an IP address. You must also specify the port to connect
 to and the terminal emulation type. By default, this Telnet will try to connect
 to the Telnet port (port 23) on the remote server. VT100 is the default terminal
 emulation used for Telnet.
 Telnet requires a username and password on the server to log on. Different
 functions and applications are available to assist you in performing remote
 administration. These depend on what services are being offered by the remote
 host. Many external devices also offer Telnet capability, such as uninterruptible
 power supplies (UPSs), remote control server administration cards, and most
 networking equipment, such as routers and switches.

 Customizing Telnet Settings
 Because of the different environments in use, Telnet offers multiple types of terminal
 emulation options. These include setting the terminal emulation, command buffer
 size, screen fonts, and cursor behavior. Some of these options are required to work on
 different types of remote hosts, but others are purely cosmetic. Figure 6-7 shows the
 available options for customizing a Telnet session.



 FIGURE 6-6

Telnet server




 FIGURE 6-7

 You can change screen fonts and cursor behavior to fit the screen output to
 your needs. These settings will not affect the server-based process. Some Telnet
 applications will not function correctly without particular cursor or font settings.
 The Local Echo option displays all of your keyboard input. The VT100 Arrows
 option specifies how cursor movement is handled. The Blinking Cursor and Block
 Cursor options adjust how the cursor is displayed on the screen.
 The Buffer Size enables you to customize the amount of history that remains in
 memory. You can scroll through to see what commands or output have already been
 processed. The default is 25 lines, but you can set this value as high as 399. The
 Telnet application will not enable you to specify fewer than 25 lines.
 The Emulation option defines what type of remote terminal to use. This controls
 how commands are interpreted and displayed by the remote server in your terminal
 session. VT52 is an older standard not commonly used anymore. VT100 is the
 default standard emulation used today.
 Another function of Telnet is logging; it logs the console display to keep a record
 of all activity. To start or stop logging, select Terminal from the menu bar, and select
 Start Logging or Stop Logging from the menu. When you select Start Logging, the
 Open Log File window appears. You need to select the folder that you want Telnet
 to save the log files to. The log files are saved as telnet.log and are readable by any
 standard text editor.


Troubleshooting with Telnet
 The primary use of Telnet is remote administration. If you are unable to connect to
 a remote server by other methods, depending upon the problem, Telnet might still
 work as long as the telnet service or daemon was installed on the server. This will
 enable you to troubleshoot and work with a remote server without being in front of
 it. If a server is inaccessible, you might still be able to contact its peripherals.
 Suppose a Windows server has crashed and is displaying a blue screen. Some
 servers include an option to have remote administration cards plugged in. In
 this case, you could telnet to this card and possibly determine whether there is a
 hardware failure, or you could reboot the server. Suppose you have a UPS attached
 to the server. This peripheral might have Telnet capability to enable you to power-
 cycle the server. Both cases enable you to remotely troubleshoot the server without
 local interaction.
 Another example of troubleshooting with Telnet is to connect to an application’s
 service (e.g., FTP, SMTP, or HTTP) to verify that it is functioning properly. As NBTSTAT 283


 discussed earlier, every TCP/IP service uses a specific TCP or UDP port. You can
 specify a particular port to connect to and test the connectivity and functionality of
 a service by issuing the type of commands for that service. For example, if you have
 a user that is having trouble sending e-mail, you could connect to your SMTP server
 from the Telnet utility and issue the SMTP command to try to send an e-mail. The
 purpose of going to the Telnet utility and not the e-mail client is that you want to
 verify whether the issue is server based or client based. If you can connect through
 Telnet and send an e-mail, then the problem is probably with the client.
 Exercise 6-2 shows how to enable Telnet services on a Windows server and then
 use Telnet for remote administration.

CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.03


NBTSTAT
 The Microsoft TCP/IP stack uses an additional subprotocol for its services,
 NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). The purpose of NetBIOS over TCP/IP is to allow
 you to connect to servers and workstations by their NetBIOS name, also known
 as the computer name, and behind the scenes that name will be converted to an
 IP address. Because this is a Microsoft addition to the TCP/IP protocol, Microsoft
 created the NBTSTAT utility to troubleshoot problems that can arise with
 NetBIOS over TCP/IP, or NetBIOS name resolution problems.




 Make sure that you are shown output and have to indicate which
 comfortable with the output of each of the command and command switch were used
 TCP/IP utilities discussed in this chapter. to create the output.
 On the Network+ exam you will be 284 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




How NetBIOS over TCP/IP Works
 NetBIOS is a software interface and naming convention used in Microsoft
 networking environments. NetBIOS was built in to NetBEUI and is also a major
 part of the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol stack. NetBIOS over TCP/IP is the use
 of the NetBIOS application programming interface over the TCP/IP protocol—
 using NetBIOS as a method of referencing systems across the network with
 NetBIOS names. These NetBIOS names need to be resolved to IP addresses for
 communication to happen on the network.

 NetBT Naming
 The NetBIOS namespace is a flat structure and is used to give unique NetBIOS
 names (computer names) to all systems on the network. This means that all
 computers within a workgroup or domain must have unique names. You will receive
 a duplicate computername error if two systems are using the same name. Names are
 composed of 16 bytes; 15 bytes are used by the actual computer name, and the last
 byte is used by the NetBIOS name suffix. The administrator or user can set the first
 15 bytes, representing the computer name, but the 16th byte is created automatically
 based on a service running on the system. The NetBIOS name suffix is a code that
 represents a service running on the system. Table 6-2 lists some common NetBIOS
 name suffix codes.


 TABLE 6-2 Suffix Usage
Popular NetBIOS 00 Workstation Service
Name Suffixes 20 Server Service or File and Print Services
 03 Messenger Service
 1C Domain Controller
 06 Remote Access Server


 Let’s look at an example: assume I had a server named SERVER1 and you noticed
 that there was a name registered on the network (more on this later) that looked like
 SERVER1&lt;20&gt;You would know that I have a computer running named SERVER1 and that it
 is running the server service, which allows clients to connect to it for the purpose NBTSTAT 285


 of file and print sharing. How do you know that SERVER1 is running the server
 service? That is what the&lt;20&gt;NetBIOS suffix means. To summarize, the NetBIOS
 suffix is used to “advertise” which services a system offers.

 NetBT Sessions
 Because NetBT runs on top of TCP/IP, sessions are set up the same way as though
 you were connecting through TCP/IP directly. There is additional overhead
 associated with this due to name resolution, but it is usually very small. When an
 application attempts to connect to a resource using NetBT, it first resolves the name
 to an IP address. Next, a TCP connection is established to port 139, designated for
 the NetBIOS session service. When connected, the computer sends a NetBIOS
 session request to the server name over the TCP connection. If the server is
 listening, it will respond with the requested information.


Using NBTSTAT
 NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot connectivity between two computers trying
 to communicate via NetBT. It displays the protocol statistics and the current
 connections to each remote host. You can also display the information about a
 remote host and the names stored in its local name cache.

 Displaying the Local Cache
 Every NetBIOS name that has been resolved is stored in memory, known as the
 NetBIOS name cache, so that the name resolution process will not need to go out
 to the network again. You can display the local cache by using the NBTSTAT -c
 option. When it comes to name resolution, the goal is to have a computer name
 that needs to be resolved in cache as quickly as possible so that the name resolves
 from memory and not through broadcast, or by contacting a WINS server. To have
 NetBIOS names referenced frequently loaded in cache automatically, you can use
 the #PRE tag in your LMHOSTS file so that those entries are loaded in cache on
 boot-up or by using the -R switch.
 By using the -n option, you can display the services the local machine is
 advertising. This lists the registered names for the local machine as well.

 Connecting to Remote Machines
 When a system boots up, it registers its NetBIOS names in the NetBIOS name table
 stored in memory on the machine. This NetBIOS name table can be queried by 286 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 anyone on the network at any point in time by using the -a switch if you are passing
 in the hostname or the -A switch if you are passing in the remote system’s IP address.
 These options enable you to determine what services the remote machine is offering.
 Core operating system services such as the Server service or the Computer Browser
 service are listed here. Applications such as Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft
 Internet Information Server (IIS) might also list entries here as well. Figure 6-8
 shows an example of a remote machine’s name table.
 Let’s analyze the output in Figure 6-8.
 NetBIOS is exposing some pretty lethal
 information that can be used against you by a
 hacker. If I were to view your NetBIOS name

 query the NetBIOS name table of a I could probably guess that you are running
 remote IP address. a Microsoft operating system because of the
 00 (workstation service) and the 20 (server
 service). You will also notice that there is a 03
 code (messenger service) registered twice—once for the locally logged-on user and
 the other for the computer name. In Windows we can send messages to users or
 computers; therefore, both names need to be registered on the network so that the
 message being sent can find the user and computer. Because the server service and
 the workstation service are registered with a name of WORKSTATION1, we know
 that WORKSTATION1 with the 03 code is the computer, so ADMINISTRATOR
 with the 03 code must be the locally logged-on user. Pretty scary! As a best practice,
 you should be renaming the administrator account, but if you don’t control who has
 access to the NetBIOS name table information, someone can find out a username
 very quickly.


 FIGURE 6-8

Viewing the
NETBIOS name

system NBTSTAT 287


 Anytime you have the IP address of a system (maybe by viewing a log file), you
 can use NBTSTAT -A&lt;ip address&gt;to find out the computer name of that IP
 address.


 Displaying Registration Statistics
 Services can register on the network in two ways—via broadcast or with the WINS
 service. You can display the statistics of how many times you have registered and
 with what method. You can also display information on how remote NetBIOS
 names are being resolved. This can help you to determine whether you are using a
 WINS service correctly or are broadcasting for services. Broadcasting can consume a
 lot of bandwidth and is generally not recommended except in the smallest networks.
 To view the registration statistics, use the -r option with NBTSTAT.

 The NBTSTAT utility can be crucial in defining problems with Microsoft
 computers. Since they use the NetBIOS naming standard, this utility is good at
 finding and isolating connectivity problems. It provides the extra information on
 NetBIOS statistics that you can’t get from regular TCP/IP utilities such as Tracert.


 Displaying Session Information
 Another option with NBTSTAT is to list the sessions that are currently open.
 You can see what you are connected to and also list the open sessions that other
 computers have with your machine. Use the -S (uppercase) option to list names by
 IP address only. When you use the -s (lowercase) option, NBTSTAT will attempt to
 resolve the IP addresses to hostnames.
 Statistics available with this option include number of bytes in, number of bytes
 out, current state, and whether the connection is inbound or outbound. Figure 6-9
 shows an example of the sessions displayed with this option.
 Table 6-3 details the NBTSTAT command-line switches and their definitions.

CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.04


Tracert
 Tracert is a command-line utility that was designed to perform a very basic task: to
 determine the path taken by a data packet to reach its destination. This is different
 from using the Ping utility. The Ping utility will give you a response if the address
 you have pinged is up and running. Tracert will send you a response with each router
 that is hit on the way. This will help you understand the number of networks, or
 hops, between you and the destination.
 This could be useful in a scenario where you know that from the Boston office to
 the New York office there are 13 hops normally, but one day users start complaining
 that the network is slow, and when you do a Tracert you notice that there are
 19 hops. This means that your packets are taking a different route than usual, and
 it could be because networks along the usual route are down and your packets are
 taking a roundabout route to get to the destination.
 When using the utility, you will notice
 several numbers in the display. Figure 6-10
 shows an example of the tracert command used
 to display the routing path to www.novell.com.

 underlying protocol. Each row gathers information about that hop
 three times. The first column shows the number
 of hops away that router is. The next three 292 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




 FIGURE 6-10

Using the Tracert
utility




 columns show the time it took for the router to respond for each attempt. The last
 column lists the fully qualified domain name of that router, which typically gives you
 an indication of where the router is. For example, looking at Figure 6-10 again you
 can see that hop number 12 looks like it is in Chicago!


Using Tracert
 Suppose you cannot access a particular web site on the Internet. Your company is
 directly connected to the Internet via an ISDN line, which is used by approximately
 35 people. You are able to hit certain web sites consistently, but others are available
 only sporadically. Other users begin to notice that they are unable to connect to the
 same web sites with which you are having a problem.
 Tracert fits in well here to begin isolating where the problem is. Although you
 might have a good idea of what network equipment and options are used within your
 company, once packets enter the Internet, there is no telling what they might come
 across. Because routes can be so dynamic, this is a great tool for figuring out where
 the data is traveling to reach its destination. Tracert 293


 You can begin troubleshooting this problem by typing one of the following
 commands:
 TRACERT&lt;hostname&gt;or
 TRACERT&lt;ipaddress&gt;After the utility has run, you might notice the following entry on one of the
 routers along the way:

 why the error is occurring, it has effectively

 attempt to translate every hop’s IP address to a
 hostname, thereby slowing the process.

 To practice Tracert, check out Exercise 6-4 from the LabBook.pdf on the
CertCam 6–4
 CD-ROM or watch the CertCam training video on the CD-ROM.



 Maximum Number of Hops
 One function of the Tracert utility is to provide the number of hops, or networks,
 that the data is crossing. You may want to limit the number of hops the program will
 make to search for the remote host; if you don’t, Tracert will continue for 30 hops
 by default. In the unusual case that you must surpass 30 hops, you can also specify a
 greater interval.
 By using the -h option with Tracert, you can specify the maximum number of
 hops to trace a route to. Figure 6-11 shows an example of limiting the number
 of hops returned. 294 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




 FIGURE 6-11

Specifying the
maximum
number of hops
with Tracert




 Note that some ISPs will not allow an ICMP packet to pass through their
 gateway, so you may get some lines with * showing there was a hop there but
 with no information displayed.



 Adjusting Timeout Values
 Another option associated with Tracert is to adjust the timeout value using the
 -w switch. This value determines the amount of time in milliseconds the program
 will wait for a response before moving on. Using this option will enable you to
 understand a little more about the problem that is occurring. For example, if you
 notice that many responses are timing out, you can raise this value. If, after raising
 this value, remote devices are responding, this could be a good indication that you
 have a bandwidth problem.

 Loose Source Routing Options
 An additional option is to use what is known as loose source routing. The -j option
 can be used to force the outbound datagram to pass through a specific router and
 back. This enables you to trace the round-trip route for a destination. A normal
 tracert follows the route until it reaches its destination or times out. When you
 specify this option, Tracert follows the path to the router specified and returns to
 your computer. To use loose source routing, enter the following command:
 TRACERT -j&lt;hop list&gt; Netstat 295


 Tracert can be a useful tool in determining why a remote host can’t be reached.
 It can also be a good tool to notice other issues, such as bandwidth utilization
 problems. Its additional options and functionality make it a powerful tool. Table 6-4
 lists the Tracert switches and the corresponding definitions.




 It is important to note that the Tracert command is used in Windows.The
 equivalent command in the Linux world is traceroute.

CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.05


Netstat
 Now that you’ve learned how to trace data packets throughout the network,
 another utility useful for troubleshooting TCP/IP-specific issues is Netstat. Netstat
 displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections. This utility
 can be used to display in-depth detail about protocol status and statistics for the
 different network interfaces, as well as viewing the current listening ports and the
 routing table. 296 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




How Netstat Works
 TCP-based connections use a three-step handshake method for establishing sessions.
 This forms the basis for TCP and its reliable data transfer methodology. This
 enables it to act as a message-validation protocol to provide reliable communication
 between two hosts. A session is created via this handshake to appropriately handle
 the transport messages. Netstat displays information about these sessions, the
 network interfaces, and how they are being used.
 By default, Netstat lists the protocol type, local address and port information,
 remote address and port information, and current state. The information provided
 explains what connections are open or in progress, through what ports, and what
 their current states are. Figure 6-12 shows an example of the Netstat utility.
 In Figure 6-12 you can see that the local address column references the local
 system, and the ports on the local system that are being used as connection points
 to a remote system. Let’s use the last entry in the output as the example to be
 analyzed. You can see in the last entry of the output that I have a connection to
 the www.syngress.com web site. How do you know this? If you look at the foreign
 address column, you will notice the FQDN of www.syngress.com (most times you
 will see an IP address here), and you will notice that the address shows a :80 at the
 end, which is the default port of a web server. This means that I am connected to
 port 80 of that FQDN. You will also notice that port 1219 is the port used by my
 local system—this would be the port used by my web browser, and it is what the
 web server at www.syngress.com uses to sends its web pages back to my system.

 Perform Exercise 6-5 from LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM or watch the
 CertCam 6–5
 CertCam training video to learn more about Netstat.

 The state column displays the current status of TCP connections only. You can
 determine from the state column whether the connection is currently established or
 the application running on that port is in listening mode (waiting for a connection).
 Table 6-5 lists the available states.


 FIGURE 6-12

 TABLE 6-5 State Explanation
A Look at the SYN_SEND Indicates an active open.
Different Netstat SYN_RECEIVED Server just received a SYN from the remote client.
States
 ESTABLISHED Client received SYN, and the connection is complete.
 LISTEN Server is waiting for a connection.
 FIN_WAIT_1 Indicates an active close.
 TIMED_WAIT Clients enter this state after an active close.
 CLOSE_WAIT Indicates a passive close; the server has just received the first
 FIN from client.
 FIN_WAIT_2 Client just received acknowledgment of its first FIN from the
 server.
 LAST+ACK Server enters this state when it sends its own FIN.
 CLOSED Server received the ACK from the client, and the connection is
 closed.




Netstat Options
 Different types of statistics are available depending on the command-line switches
 used with Netstat. You can display all connections and listening ports, because server
 connections are not displayed in the standard output. You can also display Ethernet
 statistics and per-protocol statistics. The routing table can also be displayed with this
 command.
 You can use the -n option to display addresses and port numbers without resolving
 the names. Resolving names could take additional overhead if the listing is long,
 and it might not work properly if you have no form of name resolution set up.
 Another cool switch is the interval switch—suppose you want the information that
 is displayed to continually update. By default, the information is displayed once. You
 can specify an interval in seconds appended to the end of the command to have the
 utility update itself. The following is an example of the command line:
 NETSTAT -a 5

 This command will display the active connections every five seconds. Use
 c-lrtcto stop this program. This can be helpful when trying to actively monitor
 connections and their statistics. 298 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Displaying Server Connections and Listening Ports
 From the standard output, Netstat does not display your computer’s connections
 and listening ports. This information might be necessary to understand whom the
 computer is communicating with and whether a port is open and ready to receive
 data. There are a number of Trojans that hackers plant on systems that open ports so
 that the hacker can connect to the open port later and send malicious data to that
 port. A good example is the old Netbus program. When a user ran Netbus, it would
 do nothing but open port 12345 so that the hacker could connect and do things
 like eject your CD-ROM, run a program on your system, navigate your system to a
 URL, and switch your left and right mouse buttons. It is important that you be able
 to identify whether a system has been hit with such a program, and the best way is
 to monitor the listening ports with Netstat. To view a list of listening ports, type the
 following command:
 Netstat -a



 Displaying Interface Statistics
 Another option available enables you to display the Ethernet interface statistics of
 your system. The information available with the -e option includes the number of
 bytes received and sent, the number of discards and errors, and unknown protocols.
 By understanding what this information means, you can monitor the amount of
 traffic that is being used in communications. Since this option also displays errors,
 you can check here to see if communication-related problems are occurring.
 Figure 6-13 shows an example of the Netstat utility with this option.

 Displaying Per-Protocol Statistics
 Although the previous option shows Ethernet interface-specific information,
 protocol-specific information is also available. With the -s option, you can display
 statistics for all the communications protocols used by TCP/IP. The protocols



 FIGURE 6-13

Viewing network
interface statistics
with Netstat Netstat 299


 include TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP. Detailed information can be obtained with this
 option that can help you to isolate TCP/IP communications issues.
 You can also filter the list of statistics by protocol to focus on a specific area. The
 -p option can be used alone to display connection information by TCP or UDP, or
 you can use it with the protocol statistics option (-s) to filter the statistics by TCP,
 UDP, ICMP, or IP. Figure 6-14 shows an example of this filtering.
 One of my favorite switches for Netstat is the -p switch; I can pass it the
 argument of TCP to view all the TCP-based connections that my system has. If you
 type the following command, you can view your TCP connection information:
 Netstat -p TCP



 Displaying the Current Route Table
 Netstat offers another option that enables you to display the current routing table:
 the -r switch. The output shown by Netstat -r is similar to the output seen with the
 route print command seen in Chapter 5.


Troubleshooting with Netstat
 Using Netstat to monitor TCP protocol activity can enable you to troubleshoot
 TCP/IP-based connections. Netstat can be used in a variety of ways. You can use
 the -a option to monitor active connections. I use this a lot to monitor systems
 connected to my web site. From a security point of view, you can use Netstat -a to
 view a list of listening ports—useful if you suspect that someone has planted a Trojan
 on your system. Newer versions of Windows now support the -o switch with Netstat
 to display the process ID number of the program that is responsible for opening

 the port! Very useful when trying to close down open ports and you need to know
 what program has opened the port so you know which program to end. Figure 6-15
 displays the Netstat command with the -o.

IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG
 IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG are utilities used to display the current TCP/IP
 configurations on the local workstations. IPCONFIG is a command-line utility for
 Windows NT–based systems, such as Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008 and later,
 and WINIPCFG is a graphical interface used in Windows 95, 98, and Windows
 ME. By default, they both display the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default
 gateway.


IPCONFIG
 IPCONFIG is used in Windows to display TCP/IP information from a command
 prompt. With this utility, you can also display other related IP settings, such as
 who your DNS and WINS servers are. You can also view the network interface’s
 physical MAC address with IPCONFIG. If you have more than one network
 interface, statistics are displayed about each one individually or can be filtered
 to a particular one.
 If you use the IPCONFIG command by itself with no command-line switches,
 it will display your IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway, but if you use the 302 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 /ALL switch with it, it will display all TCP/IP information available. To view all
 your TCP/IP settings, type the following in a command prompt:
 ipconfig /all

 The following output will be displayed. Notice that you can see the hostname, IP
 address, physical address (MAC address), DNS server, and IP address of the DHCP
 server that gave your system its IP address.

 IPCONFIG DHCP Parameters
 The IPCONFIG command-line utility enables you to control DHCP functions with
 command-line switches such as /release and /renew.
 The /release option removes the assigned IP address from your system. By default,
 /release removes the assigned IP address from all adapters configured for DHCP use.
 By specifying the adapter name after the switch, only that adapter will be affected
 by the command. The /release option can be useful if you are experiencing problems IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG 303


 associated with DHCP, such as realizing that you received an address from the wrong
 DHCP server. It can also be used to release the address if an IP conflict occurs.
 The /renew option sends a request to the DHCP server asking for an address.
 It takes the last address DHCP assigned to your system if it is available. If not, the
 computer is given the next available address in the pool. As with the /release option,
 you can specify a particular adapter after the switch to renew the address. This will
 only work if the adapter has been set up to receive its IP address from a DHCP
 server.
 The IPCONFIG utility also supports switches for troubleshooting DNS name
 resolution. Since Windows 2000, the operating systems have a DNS resolver cache,
 which stores responses from the DNS server in memory so that the client will not
 need to query DNS a second time for an address already stored in the cache—the
 name is resolved from the cache. If you want to display the DNS resolver cache,
 you may use the /displaydns switch with IPCONFIG. If you want to clear, or flush,
 the DNS resolver cache, you may use the /flushdns switch. Flushing the cache will
 ensure that the client system will query DNS and get up-to-date records.

 A number of times I have modified a record in DNS and had troubles
 communicating with the host that the DNS change was made for. The reason
 was because the machine I was sitting at had the old DNS data in the
 resolver cache, and I ended up needing to flush the cache.

 To display the DNS resolver cache on your system, type the following at a
 command prompt:
 ipconfig /displaydns

 To clear the entries from the DNS resolver cache, type the following at a
 command prompt:
 ipconfig /flushdns



WINIPCFG
 WINIPCFG is the Windows 95/98/ME–based graphical utility used to display
 TCP/IP information. The information displayed is the same as that in the
 IPCONFIG command-line utility used in Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008.
 Microsoft has added a graphical interface for ease of use on the Windows 9x systems,
 but it can still be run from the command line with specific switches. 304 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 WINIPCFG Options
 When you open WINIPCFG, the only information displayed by default is the
 TCP/IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway. There is a button at the
 bottom for more information. A drop-down box is included in the dialog box to
 allow you to specify a specific network card and view the TCP/IP configuration of
 that specific network card. Figure 6-17 shows WINIPCFG—notice the drop-down
 list in the middle of the screen for you to change network cards in a multicard
 system.

 DHCP Options
 The WINIPCFG utility includes buttons for releasing and renewing IP addresses for
 DHCP. It also contains information pertaining to the time and date the lease was
 obtained and when it expires. The available options in the winipcfg dialog box are
 listed as follows:

 ■ Renew_All Renew the IP address on all adapters.
 ■ Release_All Release the IP address on all adapters.
 ■ Renew Renew the IP address for a specified adapter.
 ■ Release Release the IP address for a specified adapter.


 FIGURE 6-17

The WINIPCFG
utility in
Windows 9x IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG 305


 Batch Option
 An additional option included with WINIPCFG is the /Batch switch. This enables
 you to forward the information in this utility to a text file. By default, output is
 placed in the WINIPCFG.OUT file in the %WINDIR% directory. By appending a
 path and filename to the end of this switch, you can place this information wherever
 you prefer. The batch option can be used with any command-line option available
 for this utility.

 Perform Exercise 6-6 from LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM to experiment with
 CertCam 6–6
 IPCONFIG or watch the CertCam training video.



IFCONFIG
 UNIX and Linux operating systems have a command similar to IPCONFIG and it
 is ifconfig (case sensitive). The ifconfig command stands for Interface Config and
 is used to control the network interface, which is most commonly referred to as the
 network card. Let’s look at a few ifconfig commands.
 The first example is to use ifconfig by itself without any additional switches.
 When you type ifconfig in Linux, you will get a list of network cards and the IP
 address and MAC addresses associated with each card (shown in Figure 6-18).


 FIGURE 6-18

Using ifconfig in
Linux to display
IP address
information 306 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 In Windows we can enable and disable a network card by right-clicking the LAN
 Connection and choosing Enable or Disable. In Linux, if you wish to disable the
 network card, you will use the ifconfig command as follows:
 ifconfig eth0 up

 The eth0 part of the command is how you specify the network card you wish
 to work with. If you had two network cards in the Linux computer, they would be
 known as eth0 and eth1. This is very similar to how a Cisco router refers to the
 different network interfaces. The up switch means that you wish to bring the card
 up, or enable it. If you wished to disable the card, you would use the keyword down.
 In Linux, if you wish to renew your IP address you use the dhclient command
 (shown in Figure 6-19), which is the equivalent to the Windows ipconfig /renew
 command.
 Looking at Figure 6-19, you can see that the dhclient command was typed in.
 You will also notice at the bottom of the output that a DHCPACK came from
 192.168.1.3. This means that the Linux machine has received an IP address from
 the DHCP server running on 192.168.1.3. You will also notice that the Linux
 network card is bound to address 192.168.1.8.

CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.07


FTP
 The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the TCP/IP protocol designed primarily for
 transferring files from one computer to another. FTP is the name of both a protocol
 and a utility used for the purpose of connecting to an FTP server and downloading
 a file. FTP was created to transfer data files from one host to another quickly
 and efficiently, either by allowing a user to do the download anonymously or by
 authenticating to the server.


How FTP Works
 FTP is unusual in that it uses two TCP channels to operate: TCP port 20 is used as
 the data transfer channel, and TCP port 21 is used for control commands. The data
 transfer channel is known as the DTP, or Data Transfer Process, and the command
 channel is known as the PI, or Protocol Interpreter. The two channels enable you
 to transfer data and execute commands at the same time, providing a more efficient
 and faster data transfer.
 Like Telnet, FTP requires a server-based program to answer the client requests for
 file download. An FTP service is available on most network operating systems today,
 including Windows 2003, Windows 2008, NetWare, UNIX, and Linux.
 FTP enables file transfers in several formats based on the type of remote system
 being used. Most systems have two modes of transfer: text and binary. Text transfers
 are ASCII based and use characters separated by carriage returns and newline
 characters, while binary transfer mode is used to download binary files such as
 executables or non-ASCII data. Most systems default to text mode and require you
 to switch to binary mode for a binary transfer. Figure 6-20 shows an example of an
 FTP session. 308 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




 FIGURE 6-20

An FTP session




 You will notice in Figure 6-20 that to connect to the FTP server you type:
 ftp 192.168.1.100

 The server will then ask you for a username and password. Once you type a valid
 username and password, you will be logged on and placed at the FTP prompt, where
 you can type FTP commands to potentially view, upload, and download files.

 Using FTP
 A command-line client utility is included with many versions of Windows and
 Linux, and many third-party FTP server and client applications are available for
 connecting to an FTP server and downloading files. Some third-party utilities
 are Windows-based utilities, adding a graphical interface to the download
 functionality.
 FTP is started by typing ftp at a command prompt followed by the fully qualified
 domain name or IP address of the target machine. As with Telnet, the client
 computer must be able to resolve the remote computer’s name into an IP address
 for the command to succeed. Once logged on, users can browse through directories,
 download and upload files, and log out.
 There is a wide array of commands available in the FTP utility. These commands
 are used to control the FTP application and its functions. Table 6-7 lists some of the
 more common FTP commands that are available in an FTP session. FTP 309


 TABLE 6-7 Command Description
Popular FTP cd Changes working directory.
Commands delete Deletes file.
 ls Lists current directory contents.
 bye Logs out.
 get Downloads a file.
 put Uploads a file.
 verbose Turns verbose mode on and off.



 To use the FTP utility, perform Exercise 6-7 from LabBook.pdf on the
 CertCam 6–7
 CD-ROM or watch the CertCam training video on the CD-ROM.



Conﬁguring FTP
 Users require a login ID to access FTP services if anonymous access is disabled. Most
 systems today enable an anonymous login, but these users should not possess full
 rights to the system. Common problems with connecting via FTP are an invalid
 login or insufficient access rights. If you are having problems connecting to an FTP
 server, contact your FTP server administrator to verify that your login ID is set up
 correctly.

 FTP Options
 Several switches are available for the command-line FTP utility. These options
 enable you to further customize the use of FTP to meet your needs. The -v option
 suppresses the display of remote server responses. This provides a more user-friendly
 interface to the utility. By default, when you start FTP, it attempts to log on
 automatically. You can disable this function by using the -n option.
 The -I option turns off the interactive prompting that occurs during multiple
 transfers, which makes for a more automated approach to FTP. The -d option
 enables you to turn on the debugging functions. This feature displays all FTP
 commands that are passed between the client and server. 310 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Another option included with the FTP command-line utility is the capability to
 run a script of commands after the program is started. The script file is used instead
 of redirection and can include any standard command. You must append the -s:
 switch followed by the path and filename of the script.
 One of my favorite switches for FTP is -a, which will automatically log on as
 the anonymous account; this saves you the hassle of having to type the anonymous
 account name for a logon. Table 6-8 lists the FTP command-line switches.


Troubleshooting with FTP
 When it comes to FTP, one of the biggest problems you may hit is with logging on to
 the FTP server. Make sure that you know the username and password of an account
 that is allowed to access the FTP server. If you
 are interested in uploading files to the FTP
 server, you will need to ensure that you have
 the appropriate permission to do the upload.

TFTP
 The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a slight variation on FTP. TFTP differs
 from FTP in two ways: It uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connectionless
 transport instead of TCP, and you do not log on to the remote machine. Because it
 uses UDP, TFTP does not provide error-correcting services as TCP does. This has
 advantages, but it does have to use more complex algorithms to guarantee data integrity.
 Because users do not log on, user-access and file-permission problems are avoided.
 TFTP is generally not used for file transfers as FTP is; instead, it is used in
 situations such as diskless terminals or workstations. Typically, TFTP is used to load
 applications or for bootstrapping. Because the operating systems are not loaded at
 this point, the diskless machines cannot execute FTP. TFTP handles access and
 file permissions by imposing restraints from within the host operating system. For
 example, by setting the file permissions on the TFTP server, you can limit the
 security to areas inside the TFTP server.

 TFTP is commonly employed when using Cisco routers.TFTP servers allow you
 to save the router configuration information to the TFTP server and be able to
 reload the configuration information from the TFTP server. You can also back
 up the Cisco IOS to a TFTP server.




CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.08


Ping and Hping2
 The Ping (Packet Internet Groper) command is the most used TCP/IP
 troubleshooting tool available. This command is used to test a machine’s
 connectivity to another system and to verify that the target system is active.
 Usually, using this command is the first step to any troubleshooting if a
 connectivity problem is occurring between two computers. This can quickly help
 you to determine whether a remote host is available and responsive.


How Ping Works
 Ping uses the ICMP protocol to verify connections to remote hosts by sending echo
 request packets and listening for echo reply packets. Ping sends out four different 312 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 echo messages and prints out feedback of the replies on the screen when the reply is
 received. Figure 6-21 shows an example of a ping.

 To use a Ping command and see the results, perform Exercise 6-8 from
 CertCam 6–8
 LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM or watch the CertCam training video.



Ping Options
 Additional options are available to customize the output that Ping provides. Options
 include changing packet length, type of service, and TTL settings. You can append
 the -a option to resolve an IP address to its hostname. The -f option will not enable
 the packets to be fragmented by a router or gateway. This can be used to further
 stress connections to determine whether they are failing.
 The TTL settings can be specified with the -i option. In addition, the type of
 service option is available via the -v switch.

 Setting the Length Option
 By default, packets are sent in 32-byte chunks. You can modify the packet size to
 further test the response time. When larger packets are involved, you can see what
 larger loads will do to response time as well as responsiveness. To change the packet
 size, use the -l option followed by the packet length. The maximum packet length
 that can be specified is 65,500 bytes.

 Setting the Number of Echo Packets
 You can specify the number of packets to send to the remote host. By default, only
 four packets are sent. You can specify any number of packets to send with the -n
 option. You can also use the -t option to specify a continuous stream of packets, and


 FIGURE 6-21

another system. Ping and Hping2 313


 to continuously ping the remote host until you stop the command with a kaerb-lrtc .
 This functionality is useful in monitoring trends in data transfers.

 Timeout Intervals
 Timeout intervals are used to interpret the time to travel between hops. A normal
 LAN usually lists devices as being less than 10 milliseconds away. By default, two
 seconds is the timeout before a “reply timed out” message is generated. You can use
 the -w option to raise this value for troubleshooting.

 Loose Source Routing
 Use Ping to specify intermediate gateways to test against. You can route packets
 through particular IP addresses or hostnames specified. The -j option enables you
 to specify the hosts to route through. The -k option enables you to exclude hosts
 from this route list. The maximum number of hosts you can specify with both
 options is nine.


Troubleshooting with Ping
 Use the Ping utility to verify connectivity by IP address or hostname. You must
 be able to resolve the hostname to use this functionality. If you are unable to ping
 by hostname, but you can ping by IP address, you most likely will have a name-
 resolution problem.
 If you are receiving “reply timed out” messages, you might try to bump up the
 timeout value with the -w option. Maybe the packets are arriving but are timing
 out before two seconds. After bumping up the value, if the replies are returning, a
 bandwidth problem might be present. Contact the network administrator where the
 numbers seem to rise. Table 6-9 details the ping command-line switches.




 The Ping utility uses the ICMP Type 8 is the message type of an

Hping2
 The Ping utility that ships with most operating systems uses ICMP as the
 underlining protocol. There are other Ping-type utilities out there that give you
 more flexibility, such as Hping or the newer version, Hping2. Hping2 is popular
 because instead of using ICMP it uses TCP as the underlining protocol and allows
 you to craft the packets to use whatever port you wish to use. This allows you to
 ping through firewalls that may be blocking ICMP traffic. The following is a typical
 Hping2 command:
 hping2 -c 3 -s 53 -p 80 -S 10.0.0.25

 In this code example the -c switch is used to specify how many ping messages you
 wish to send. In this example I have specified to send three messages. The -s switch
 is used to specify the source port and the -p is used to specify the destination port
 of the packet. In this example, I have made the traffic look as if it is coming from a
 DNS server but destined for the web server. The -S specifies that I want to send a
 TCP SYN message, while the 10.0.0.25 is the target IP address of the system to ping.

NSLOOKUP and DIG
 The NSLOOKUP command is used to verify DNS name resolution from a DNS
 server. This is very useful for a Windows network, which depends immensely
 on the use of DNS. If DNS should fail or return improper information, network
 communication can slow due to name resolution. If DNS fails, the client systems
 could have trouble authenticating, and domain controllers could have trouble
 communicating with one another, because locating a domain controller on the
 network is a function of DNS. In a Windows network, Active Directory needs DNS,
 or Active Directory will fail and the domain will fail. 316 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




How NSLOOKUP Works
 NSLOOKUP will query a DNS server for specific types of records and can be used to
 troubleshoot why a system cannot connect to another remote system. If there is an
 incorrect record in DNS, or no record at all, you will be able to determine this with
 NSLOOKUP.
 These items can be verified fairly quickly if you are located at the client PC. You
 can ping the server by the server IP address. If you can ping the server by IP address
 and not by the server DNS name, there is a DNS name-resolution issue. You can
 then pursue the issue further by using NSLOOKUP to verify that the DNS server is
 operational and that a record exists for the host in the DNS database.
 It is possible, but unlikely, that the name to an IP address resolution is incorrect.
 The DNS name could be matched to an improper IP address. This can cause the
 data packets to be sent to a PC or network device other than the correct system, or
 even to a nonexistent IP address.


NSLOOKUP Options
 There are two modes in which you can use NSLOOKUP: interactive and
 noninteractive.

 Interactive Mode
 In interactive mode you simply type the NSLOOKUP command; you are then placed
 at the NSLOOKUP prompt, where you type one NSLOOKUP command after
 another. Figure 6-23 displays the interactive prompt. Notice that one command is
 typed after the other and they all work together to obtain a result.
 Interactive mode is used when you have more than one item in the DNS database
 you will be querying. Interactive mode will allow you enter a command-line
 state that will keep prompting you for more commands until you type exit at the
 NSLOOKUP command prompt to return to a standard DOS command prompt and
 exit the NSLOOKUP utility.
 Notice in Figure 6-23 that the command nslookup was typed to go to interactive
 mode. In interactive mode, you would then type the different nslookup commands
 at the prompt that displays with a&gt;. Notice that set type=mx was typed next—this
 tells nslookup that I want to find MX records for whatever domain I specify next.
 MX records point to the mail servers for a company, which is what is specified in
 the next line—glensworld.loc—my fictitious company. Notice in the figure that NSLOOKUP and DIG 317


 FIGURE 6-23

 nslookup returns the address of the MX record, which is equal to win2003
 .glensworld.loc, which has the Internet address of 192.168.1.3.
 Table 6-10 lists the commands available in the NSLOOKUP prompt.

 Noninteractive Mode
 When using noninteractive mode, you will type the NSLOOKUP command followed
 by the command options. You are not placed at an interactive prompt where you
 type many commands. Figure 6-24 displays the noninteractive use of NSLOOKUP.
 In this example, you are simply trying to resolve a single host to an IP address. You
 can see from Figure 6-24 that the address www.gleneclarke.com has the IP address of
 24.89.233.148.

 To check out NSLOOKUP, perform Exercise 6-9 in LabBook.pdf on the

DIG
 DIG is a very popular TCP/IP utility that is available on most Linux systems and is
 used to query DNS. DIG will give you much the same information as NSLOOKUP
 but is much more flexible. Let’s look at some examples. If you simply want to find
 out the IP address for a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) you simply type the dig
 command followed by the FQDN as shown in Figure 6-25.
 What I love about the dig command is that as you learn the commands, you can
 place the +short switch on the command to see the “short” version of the results.
 Looking back to Figure 6-25, you can see that when you typed the command in, it
 came back and summarized the question and gave us the answer—I don’t want all
 that! Just give me the answer is what the “+short” switch does. Figure 6-26 displays
 the “+short” switch being used.
 There are a wealth of example commands we can use with DIG. I have
 summarized the commands I use most in Table 6-11.

Other TCP/IP Utilities
 This chapter is such a big chapter because there are so many TCP/IP utilities and
 options with each utility. You need to be familiar with a few more utilities for the
 Network+ exam—they are the hostname, MTR, and route commands.


Hostname and Host
 There is a popular utility in Windows and Linux that you can use to find out the
 computername, or hostname, of your system—the command is the hostname
 command, which is shown in Figure 6-27. Other TCP/IP Utilities 321


 FIGURE 6-27

system name with
the hostname
command.


 Another useful utility that is available on Linux systems to query DNS is the host
 utility. There are a number of switches that go along with the host utility, but in its
 simplest form you could type:
 host www.gleneclarke.com

 This will return the IP address of the FQDN www.gleneclarke.com. You can also
 perform tasks such as finding all the mail servers for the company as you can with
 DIG or NSLOOKUP. To do this with the host command, you type the following
 command:
 host -t MX glensworld.loc

 In this code example the -t switch allows you to specify which records you wish
 to query for; in my example I am looking for the MX records from the domain
 glensworld.loc. Figure 6-28 displays the output of the two host commands discussed.


MTR
 MTR is a network diagnostics program available in Linux that combines features of
 Tracert and Ping. It is a glorified traceroute tool that sends multiple ping messages to
 each router between the source and the destination. To use MTR, you simply type
 mtr and then specify your destination as shown in Figure 6-29.

utility that

with Ping.




 You can see in the figure that there are five hops between my system and the
 destination. With each destination you can see the packets sent and the packets that
 have been received as replies along with the percentage of packets lost.


Route
 The route command is a very popular TCP/IP utility that is used to manage
 the routing table of the local system. You learned about the route command in
 Chapter 5, but just as a refresher Table 6-12 is a listing of popular options to the
 route command.


Arping
 Arping is a popular Linux utility that combines the ping command with the concept
 of ARP. Remember that ARP is a protocol used to convert the IP address to a MAC
 address—so when you use arping, you will be sending out ping messages but you will
 get replies that include the MAC address of the IP address you pinged. Very cool!
 Figure 6-30 displays the output of the arping utility.

 Now that you have an understanding of some of the popular TCP/IP utilities,
 let’s look at some popular troubleshooting situations that can be solved with these
 utilities.



CERTIFICATION OBJECTIVE 6.11


Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities
 The two most common TCP/IP problems are network connectivity and name
 resolution. In this section, you will learn how to troubleshoot these problems and
 how to determine where the problems truly reside.
 Given the following scenario, how do you troubleshoot the problem?

 Scenario You are trying to use a third-party application to access a remote com-
 puter via TCP/IP. You are unable to connect to the remote server.
 To properly troubleshoot this problem, you must know where to begin. Most
 communication problems with TCP/IP can be categorized as one of the following:

 ■ Basic network connectivity problem
 ■ Name resolution problem 324 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 It is very easy to determine which problem is occurring in a given situation. Start
 by trying to access the resource via the IP address rather than the hostname by
 pinging the IP address. For example, if the problem is related to name resolution,
 pinging the hostname might not work, but pinging the IP address will. This indicates
 that, because you can communicate with the IP address but not the hostname, you
 are having name-resolution problems. If you cannot access the resource via the IP
 address, this indicates a connectivity problem—the system does not exist or it is
 turned off, or you have a network problem.


Connectivity Problems
 Connectivity problems can be difficult to isolate and resolve quickly, especially in
 complex networks. Let’s use some of the tools you’ve learned about to troubleshoot
 the earlier problem of using a third-party application to access a remote computer
 via TCP/IP and being unable to connect to the remote server. You cannot ping the
 remote host by its IP address.

 Check Your TCP/IP Configuration
 Start by checking your TCP/IP configuration. TCP/IP requires several settings to
 be complete and accurate. When you use TCP/IP as your network protocol, an
 incorrect setting such as a mistyped subnet mask can keep your computer from
 talking with other hosts on the network. For example, if you have an incorrect
 default gateway setup, you might not be able to communicate with anyone on a
 remote network.
 Use the IPCONFIG utility or (on Linux or UNIX) the ifconfig utility to
 determine your computer’s basic TCP/IP settings. Verify that the IP address and
 subnet mask displayed by the IPCONFIG command are the correct values for your
 computer. Verify that your default gateway is set up with the correct address of the
 router on the network.

 Ping the Loopback Address
 Try pinging the loopback address by pinging “localhost,” “loopback,” or the address
 127.0.0.1. You can use the ping command to verify that TCP/IP is working properly.
 By pinging the loopback address, which is 127.0.0.1, you are actually verifying that
 the protocol stack is functioning properly. You should receive a reply like the one
 shown in Figure 6-31. Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities 325


 FIGURE 6-31

Pinging the
loopback address




 An error while pinging the loopback address usually indicates a problem with the
 TCP/IP protocol installed locally. If you do receive an error at this point, you should
 try uninstalling and reinstalling TCP/IP. You can remove and install TCP/IP from
 your LAN connection properties.

 Ping the Local IP Address
 If you can successfully ping the loopback address, try pinging your local computer’s
 IP address. If you do not know what your IP address is, remember that IPCONFIG/
 WINIPCFG will display this information for you. By typing the following at a
 command prompt, you should receive a response similar to the one shown back in
 Figure 6-31:
 PING&lt;local IP address&gt;If an error occurs at this point, there might be a problem communicating with
 the NIC. You can first try reinstalling the adapter driver for the card. If that doesn’t
 work, try removing and reseating the card. This error might only be resolved by
 completely replacing the NIC.

 Clear the ARP Cache Table
 If the local IP address responds correctly, try clearing the ARP cache. If an IP address
 was stored here by mistake, it could cause the client to attempt to contact the wrong
 computer. 326 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Start by displaying the ARP cache. You can then see if there is an entry located
 for the remote IP address. If an incorrect entry exists, try deleting it with the -d
 option.

 Verify the Default Gateway
 After removing any errant entries from the ARP cache, the next step is to ping the
 default gateway that your system is using. By pinging the default gateway, you are
 verifying two items in one step: you are verifying whether or not your system can
 communicate on the network with another host, and you are verifying that the
 default gateway is available. The default gateway will be involved in communication
 only if you are trying to communicate with a host on a remote network. If the
 gateway does not respond, the packets will not be able to get to the remote host.

 You can use IPCONFIG or ifconfig (in Linux) to display your default gateway.
 Once you have that address, try pinging that address to verify that the
 gateway is up and running.



 Trace the Route to the Remote Host
 After a packet leaves the default gateway, any route can be taken to reach a remote
 computer. The next step is to try to trace the route to the remote computer.
 A wide array of problems could show up here. You may notice that when the
 utility gets to a certain point, it responds with “Request timed out.” If this occurs, it
 could indicate a route problem or a device failure. It could also indicate bandwidth
 issues. Try raising the timeout value. If it responds but with high values, your data
 transfers could be failing because the application does not wait long enough. Try
 reconfiguring your application or adding more bandwidth to your network.
 Another error message you might receive is “Destination Net Unreachable.” This
 usually indicates a network routing problem. Contact the network administrator
 responsible for that network segment.

 Check TCP/IP Port on the Server
 The next thing to try is to verify that you are sending data to the correct port. For
 example, your web browser automatically tries to connect to port 80 on a server; if
 the administrator of that server changes the port value, you will need to specify the
 port when you make the connection. Table 6-13 lists the standard port settings for
 commonly used protocols. Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities 327


 TABLE 6-13 Port Protocol
Common Ports 80 HTTP
Used by Network 443 HTTPS
Services
 21 FTP
 23 TELNET
 25 SMTP
 110 POP3
 3389 Remote Desktop


 You can use the Telnet tool to verify that the other computer is configured to
 permit connections on the same port you are using. If you do not receive an error
 message, the other computer is configured to enable connections. If you do receive
 an error, try looking at the settings on the remote computer to verify that they are
 set up properly.


Name Resolution Problems
 Suppose you are able to connect to a remote host by IP address but are unable
 to connect via its hostname. This indicates a name resolution problem. In the
 Microsoft world, there are two types of computer names: fully qualified domain
 names (FQDNs) used by socket-based applications and NetBIOS names (computer
 names) used by NetBIOS applications. These names can be resolved in several ways,
 including using the Domain Name System (DNS), the Windows Internet Naming
 Service (WINS), a hosts file, or an lmhosts file. Each method has its advantages and
 disadvantages.




 Although there are many it clear that DNS resolves FQDNs to IP
 techniques used to resolve the two addresses whereas WINS resolves NetBIOS
 different style names, for the exam, have names to IP addresses. 328 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Name-Resolution Order
 The two types of Microsoft computer names each work a little differently. They can
 use the other’s services; however, they use their own resolution methods first. When
 communicating with an FQDN, the name is resolved by the following resolution
 methods (in order):

 1. Checking the local name
 2. Checking the local HOSTS file
 3. Checking DNS servers
 4. Checking the local NetBIOS cache
 5. Checking WINS servers
 6. Broadcasts

 NetBIOS name resolution works in a very similar way. The NetBIOS name is
 resolved by using the following method:

 1. Checking its local NetBIOS cache
 2. Checking the WINS server
 3. Broadcasting for a computer
 4. Checking the LMHOSTS file
 5. Checking the local hostname (if Enable DNS For Windows Resolution is
 checked in TCP/IP properties)
 6. Checking the TCP/IP HOSTS file
 7. Checking DNS servers

 By knowing the order of name resolution, you can better understand how these
 services work and effectively troubleshoot them.

 Check the Hosts File
 You can start by checking the hosts file. A hosts file is a text file that can be
 configured with any standard text editor. It contains static mappings for remote
 TCP/IP hosts by using an IP address column and a hostname column. Each
 computer has its own hosts file, HOSTS, located in %windir% for Windows 9x,
 and HOSTS located in %SystemRoot%System32DriversEtc for Windows
 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008. Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities 329


 Because every machine maintains its own HOSTS file, they are not generally
 used in medium or large environments. If a modification or addition has to be made,
 each machine needs to receive this update by receiving a new version of the hosts
 file. When you are talking about four or five machines, it’s not that bad. When you
 have to keep 150 machines up to date, it can become very difficult. Figure 6-32
 shows an example of a hosts file.
 To check your HOSTS file, open it and scan for the entry of the remote host.
 If your computer resolves addresses using this file, verify that the entry exists and
 that it contains the correct information. If this is not the resolution method you are
 using, trying checking your DNS configuration.

 Check Your Domain Name System Configuration
 DNS provides TCP/IP name-resolution services. DNS is a central server that systems
 can use to query for name resolution. For example, if any system on your network
 were to try to contact server1.yourdomain.com, any system can query DNS and have
 the name resolved. In addition, if an entry is added to the DNS server, all systems
 know about the change right away, because DNS is a central database that everyone
 uses (versus the HOSTS file, which all users have their own copy of).


 FIGURE 6-32

The hosts file
used for FQDN
name resolution 330 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 If you use DNS for name resolution, first verify that you have the DNS client
 set up correctly on the workstation. From a command prompt, type ipconfig /all to
 list the DNS servers configured on a client. If they exist and are correct, try pinging
 the DNS server to see if it is online. If it responds, try changing your DNS server
 to another DNS server, if you have multiple DNS servers. It is possible that one
 DNS server might have information that is different from what another has. You
 also might need to contact your DNS administrator to verify that the name exists in
 DNS and has the correct information.

 It is possible that name resolution is a problem because your DNS resolver
 cache is incorrect. When troubleshooting DNS problems always flush the DNS
 resolver cache on the client by typing ipconfig /flushdns.



 Check the LMHOSTS File
 The LMHOSTS file is similar to the hosts file but is used primarily for NetBIOS
 name resolution, as opposed to FQDN resolution. It can be used to handle TCP/IP
 hostname resolution, but it is not recommended, because it is low in the name-
 resolution techniques order.
 Like the hosts file, LMHOSTS is a text file that can be edited with any standard
 text editor. If your network uses LMHOSTS files for NetBIOS name resolution
 and you cannot connect to the remote computer using its NetBIOS name, there
 could be an invalid entry in your LMHOSTS file. Try scanning this file for the
 name of the remote machine. Verify that it exists and that it contains the correct
 information. If you are not using LMHOSTS, try checking your WINS server
 configuration settings.

 The LMHOSTS file that comes with 2000/XP and Windows 2003 has a hidden
 file extension of .SAM (for sample). You will not see this file extension unless
 you turn off the hiding of known file extensions in Windows, and the file will
 not work with a .sam extension—you will need to rename the file so that it is
 called simply LMHOSTS, not LMHOSTS.sam.



 Check Your Windows Internet Naming Service Configuration
 A WINS server provides NetBIOS name resolution much the way DNS servers
 provide TCP/IP hostname resolution. If you use WINS for NetBIOS name Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities 331


 resolution and you cannot connect to the other machine with its NetBIOS name,
 there might be a problem with your computer’s WINS configuration.
 Start by verifying that your system is
 configured to use a WINS server. From a
 command prompt, type ipconfig /all. This will
 display the current WINS servers configured for
 Make sure that you your computer. If the correct servers are listed,
understand the difference between try pinging the WINS server. If you cannot ping
hostname resolution and NetBIOS name the WINS server address, contact your WINS
resolution for the Network+ exam. administrator to correct the problem. You might
 also need to verify that the remote host you are
 trying to connect to is registered with WINS
 correctly.

 Check Your Domain Name Server Database
 A domain name server (DNS) will provide the DNS domain name–to–IP
 address resolution when trying to connect to services using domain names, such
 as on the Internet. If the name and IP address are not matched correctly in the
 database, you will be unable to access the proper PC for the services you are
 requesting.
 For example, if you were on the Internet and wanted to access an FTP site,
 but the company had changed the IP address of the FTP server, you would type
 in the DNS name of the FTP server in the address bar, and this name would be
 matched to the old FTP IP address. The FTP utility would try to query the old
 IP address for the FTP service. If no FTP service existed on the old IP address, or
 a server were not currently using the old IP address, you would receive an error
 message. Until the company updated the DNS servers on the Internet, the FTP
 server would be unreachable unless you could find the new IP address of the
 FTP server.
 After querying the DNS server and getting an IP address for the DNS name,
 you should try to ping the IP address returned to verify that the server at the IP
 address is functioning.
 It is also possible that the DNS server might be unavailable and you will
 receive no response to your request for the DNS name resolution. If this occurs,
 you will need to change your DNS server setting on the client to a server that is
 functioning, or contact someone about the DNS server and report that it is not
 functioning. 332 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




CERTIFICATION SUMMARY
 This chapter has introduced you to a number of TCP/IP utilities that are popular
 for everyday troubleshooting and for the Network+ exam. Be sure that you are
 familiar with each command-line tool before you book the exam. Also make sure
 you understand the output shown by the different commands and the command-line
 switches—you will most definitely be tested in this area.
 The ARP utility is used to troubleshoot the ARP process, including the display
 and modification of the ARP cache. This protocol maintains the mappings between
 the layer-3 TCP/IP addresses and the layer-2 Ethernet addresses. Each time you
 access a remote computer, its IP address/MAC address entry is updated in the
 ARP cache if need be. Entries can also be manually added and deleted. By default,
 the ARP cache maintains unused entries for two minutes, and it can contain a
 frequently used entry for up to ten minutes. RARP works in reverse to provide
 Ethernet addresses to TCP/IP address mappings.
 The Telnet utility provides a virtual terminal to execute remote console
 commands. Telnet uses a TCP protocol connection to port 23. Telnet can also be
 used to connect to other ports set up to be interactive. The default line buffer size
 is 25, and it can be configured to a maximum of 399 lines. The default terminal
 emulation for Telnet is VT100.
 NBTSTAT displays NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocol statistics. NetBT
 is a software standard and naming convention used to connect to remote systems.
 Each workstation in a domain or workgroup must have a unique NetBIOS name.
 NetBIOS names are 16 bytes, with the last byte reserved for the NetBIOS name
 suffix. You can display the name table of a host by using nbtstat -A&lt;ip address&gt;.
 Tracert is used to determine the route that data travels to reach its destination. It
 uses the ICMP protocol to display status information such as hop count and timeout
 values. You can specify the maximum number of hops and timeout values to further
 customize the utility.
 Netstat displays TCP/IP protocol statistics and session information. You can also
 display the local IP routing table with Netstat. Netstat can display Ethernet-specific
 statistics, protocol statistics, and session information, including listening ports.
 IPCONFIG displays the current TCP/IP configuration for a Windows XP/2003/
 Vista/2008 computer. WINIPCFG is a graphical interface used on Windows 95/98/
 ME computers to display TCP/IP configuration information such as IP address,
 subnet mask, DNS servers, WINS servers, and default gateway. These utilities can
 be used to release or renew DHCP addresses assigned to a system. Certiﬁcation Summary 333


 The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used for file transfers between two computers.
FTP requires two TCP port connections: port 20 for data, and port 21 for control
commands. Using the two ports allows for faster transfer speeds than sending both
types of data over the one port. A server-based FTP program, called a service or
daemon, is used to store files and process commands.
 Ping is used to verify a remote computer’s connectivity to the network. Additional
options for troubleshooting include setting packet lengths, changing the TTL values,
and specifying host lists to return routing statistics for.
 NSLOOKUP and DIG are used to query a DNS server for information in its
database to verify that name resolution is working with DNS names. 334 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities




✓ TWO-MINUTE DRILL
 ARP
 ❑ The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) was designed to provide a mapping
 from the logical 32-bit TCP/IP addresses to the physical 48-bit MAC
 addresses.
 ❑ Address resolution is the process of finding the address of a host within a
 network.
 ❑ Remember that ARP translates IP addresses (layer 3) into MAC addresses
 (layer 2). The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is used to find a
 TCP/IP address from a MAC address.
 ❑ Only four types of messages can be sent by the ARP protocol on any
 machine:
 ❑ ARP request
 ❑ ARP reply
 ❑ RARP request
 ❑ RARP reply
 ❑ The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) enables a machine to
 learn its own IP address by broadcasting to resolve its own MAC address.

 Telnet
 ❑ Telnet was designed to provide a virtual terminal or remote login across the
 network. It is connection based and handles its own session negotiation.
 ❑ The primary use of Telnet is for remote administration.
 ❑ Telnet uses TCP port 23.


 NBTSTAT
 ❑ The Microsoft TCP/IP stack uses an additional protocol for networking
 services, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT).
 ❑ NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
 ❑ NBTSTAT -A&lt;ip address&gt;will display the name table of the IP address
 supplied. This is a useful feature when you know the IP address of a system
 and want to know the computer name.
 ❑ NBTSTAT -R purges and reloads the NetBIOS name cache. Two-Minute Drill 335


 ❑ NBTSTAT -c will display the NetBIOS name cache, which displays
 computer names that have been resolved to IP addresses.

Tracert
 ❑ Tracert is a command-line utility that was designed to perform a very basic
 task: to determine the path taken by a data packet to reach its destination.
 ❑ You will use the trace route utility by typing TRACERT&lt;ip address&gt;.


Netstat
 ❑ Netstat displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections.
 ❑ Using Netstat to monitor TCP protocol activity can enable you to
 troubleshoot TCP/IP-based connections.
 ❑ Netstat -a will display listening ports—useful if you need to monitor what
 applications are awaiting a connection.
 ❑ Netstat -n will display who is connected to your system along with port
 information.

IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG
 ❑ IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG are utilities used to display the current TCP/IP
 configurations on the local workstations and to modify the DHCP addresses
 assigned to each interface.
 ❑ IPCONFIG is used in Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 to display TCP/IP
 information from a command prompt.
 ❑ WINIPCFG is the Windows 95/98/ME–based graphical utility used to display
 TCP/IP information.
 ❑ The ifconfig (lowercase) command is used to display TCP/IP setting on
 UNIX and Linux.

FTP
 ❑ The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed primarily for transferring data
 across a network.
 ❑ TFTP differs from FTP in two ways: It uses the User Datagram Protocol
 (UDP) connectionless transport instead of TCP, and it does not log on to the
 remote machine. 336 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 Ping and Hping2
 ❑ The Ping command is used to test a machine’s connectivity to the network
 and to verify that it is active.
 ❑ Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to verify
 connections to remote hosts by sending echo packets and listening for reply
 packets.
 ❑ Use the Ping utility to verify connectivity by IP address or hostname.
 ❑ The two most common problems with TCP/IP are network connectivity and
 name resolution problems.
 ❑ Make sure you understand the differences between hostname resolution
 and NetBIOS (machine) name resolution. The exam will quiz you on both
 scenarios.

 NSLOOKUP and DIG
 ❑ NSLOOKUP displays information in the DNS server database.
 ❑ You can use NSLOOKUP to troubleshoot name resolution problems that
 may arise because of incorrect records on the server.
 ❑ DIG is a very popular Linux tool used to query and troubleshoot DNS.


 Other TCP/IP Utilities
 ❑ The host and hostname utilities are used to display the local system name.
 ❑ The route command is used to manage the local routing table.
 ❑ The MTR command is a Linux command that combines features of Tracert
 and Ping.

 Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities
 ❑ When troubleshooting connectivity issues first use ipconfig to display and
 verify your TCP/IP settings.
 ❑ Use the ping command to test and verify which systems you can
 communicate with.
 ❑ Always remember that if you cannot communicate with a system by name,
 try to use the IP address. Most communication problems are due to name
 resolution issues. Self Test 337

SELF TEST ANSWERS

ARP
 1. C. ARP is responsible for converting a layer-3 address (IP address) to a layer-2 address
 (MAC address). A utility by the same name is available in most operating systems and is
 responsible for modifying entries within the ARP cache.
 A, B, and D are incorrect. NBTSTAT is used to view the NetBIOS name table of a system,
 Telnet is used to open a terminal emulation session with a terminal server, and SNMP is used
 for monitoring of devices.
 2. B and C. ARP decline and ARP response are not valid ARP messages. There are only four
 types of messages that can be sent out by the ARP protocol: ARP request, ARP reply, RARP
 request, and RARP reply.
 A and D are incorrect because they are valid ARP messages.
 3. C. Two minutes. Unlike static addresses, which never age out, dynamic addresses
 remain for only a predetermined amount of time. Windows adjusts the size of the ARP cache
 automatically. Entries not used after two minutes are removed. If entries are used frequently,
 they remain in the ARP cache for ten minutes.
 A, B, and D are incorrect because a dynamic ARP entry remains in cache for two minutes
 by default.
 4. A. ARP is responsible for converting IP addresses (layer-3 addresses) to MAC addresses
 (layer-2 addresses).
 B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the layered addresses that ARP is
 responsible for resolving.
 5. C. ARP -a will display the ARP cache, which is what the output for this question is
 showing. Be sure you can identify the output for the exam.
 A, B, and D are incorrect because they are the wrong commands or switches to generate
 this output.

Telnet
 6. C. Telnet (telecommunications network) was designed to provide a virtual terminal or
 remote login across the network. This enables the user to execute commands on a remote
 machine anywhere on the network as if he or she were sitting in front of the console. The term
 Telnet refers to both the protocol and the application used for remote management.
 A, B, and D are incorrect because FTP allows for file transfers between two PCs; Ping is
 used to verify that connectivity can be established between two PCs; and NBTSTAT will allow
 you to view the NetBIOS name table available on a PC. 346 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



 7. A. Telnet uses TCP port 23 by default.
 B, C, and D are incorrect because FTP uses ports 20 and 21, HTTP uses port 80, and
 SMTP uses port 25.
 8. B and D. VT100 and ANSI. The terminal emulation option defines what type of remote
 terminal to use. This controls how commands are interpreted and displayed by the remote
 server.
 A and C are incorrect. VT52 is an older standard not commonly used anymore.
 VT100/ANSI is the default standard emulation used today. DEC is not an available option.

NBTSTAT
 9. C. NetBIOS uses unique 15-character names for each system, known as computer names.
 Each NetBIOS name is made of 16 bytes; 15 are used for the computer name, and the 16th byte
 is used as the NetBIOS name suffix, which identifies a service running on the system.
 A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not use 16-byte names.
10. C. NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot connectivity between two computers trying to
 communicate via NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). It displays the protocol statistics and the
 current connections to each remote host. You can also display the information about a remote
 host and the names stored in its NetBIOS name table.
 A, B, and D are incorrect. NetBT stands for NetBIOS over TCP/IP; NetBEUI is a
 nonroutable protocol; and NetBIOS is a software and naming convention. All of these are
 protocols, not utilities.
11. B. The -c option is correct. When a system resolves a NetBIOS name to an IP address, that
 information is stored in the NetBIOS name cache.
 A, C, and D are incorrect. The -R option will purge the cache and reload any entries in
 the cache that have the #PRE tag in the LMHOSTS file. The -a parameter is used to list a
 name table of a remote PC by specifying the name of the remote PC; -A does the same, but you
 must specify the remote PC by IP address. You should know all these switches for the exam.
12. D. NetBIOS names are registered in two ways, via broadcast or with a WINS service.
 You can also display information on how remote NetBIOS names are being resolved using
 the NBTSTAT utility. This can help you to determine whether you are using a WINS service
 correctly or are broadcasting for services.
 B is incorrect. The hosts file is used for FQDN–to–IP address resolution for the network.
13. D. The local NetBIOS name table can be viewed with NBTSTAT -n. This output shows
 the names that this system has registered on the network and indicates what services it runs. In
 this example you can see that the system runs the server service and workstation service. Self Test Answers 347


 A, B, and C are incorrect. IPCONFIG /ALL is used to view all the TCP/IP settings on
 the host, NBTSTAT -A is used to view the NetBIOS name table of a remote system, and
 NETSTAT -n is used to view the active connections.

Tracert
14. D. Tracert is a command-line utility that was designed to determine the path taken by a
 data packet to reach its destination. This can be very helpful in determining at what point a
 network connection is no longer active. It can also be helpful in troubleshooting issues with
 network response times.
 A, B, and C are incorrect. NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot NetBIOS over TCP/IP. ARP
 is used to view or modify the ARP cache. FTP is used to transfer files between two PCs.
15. A. Tracert sends back multiple responses, one for each router that it hits on its way to the
 destination address. In this example we are tracing the pathway to www.novell.com and getting
 a hop entry with each router on the way.
 B, C, and D are incorrect. Ping is used to send a test message to the destination but
 does not send a response with each router it hits, NSLOOKUP is used to query DNS and
 troubleshoot DNS problems, and the route print command is used to view the routing table of
 a system.

Netstat
16. C. Netstat displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections. This
 utility can be used to display in-depth detail about protocol status, statistics for the different
 network interfaces, and the current routing table.
 A and B are incorrect. NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot NetBIOS over TCP/IP. ARP is
 used to troubleshoot the ARP cache.
17. B. The Netstat utility is used to view TCP/IP connection information and listening ports.
 A, C, and D are incorrect. NBTSTAT is used to troubleshoot NetBIOS over TCP/IP,
 IPCONFIG is used to view your TCP/IP settings, and ARP is used to view or modify your
 ARP cache.

IPCONFIG and WINIPCFG
18. D. All of the options listed can be displayed in IPCONFIG by using the /ALL option.
 A, B, and C are incorrect because all are available for display in IPCONFIG. 348 Chapter 6: TCP/IP Utilities



19. D. The /renew switch is used to renew the IP address that you have obtained from the
 DHCP server.
 A, B, and C are incorrect. /ALL will display all of your TCP/IP settings, and /RELEASE
 will allow your system to give up its IP address. /OBTAIN is not a switch of IPCONFIG.
20. B. IPCONFIG /ALL is used to view all of the TCP/IP settings on a system.
 A, C, and D are incorrect: /SHOWITALL and /DISPLAYALL are not switches of
 IPCONFIG, and IPCONFIG by itself shows only basic settings, not all the settings.

FTP
21. A. FTP (the File Transfer Protocol) is designed primarily for transferring data across a
 network. FTP denotes both a protocol and a utility used for this purpose.
 B, C, and D are incorrect. Ping is used to verify communication between two PCs, and
 Telnet is used to create a remote session with a Telnet server.
22. A and C. FTP uses two TCP channels to operate. It uses TCP port 20 as the data transfer
 channel and TCP port 21 for control commands. The data transfer channel is known as the
 DTP, or data transfer process, and the command channel is known as the PI, or Protocol
 Interpreter. The two channels enable you to transfer data and execute commands at the same
 time, and they provide a more efficient and faster data transfer. FTP also works in real time. It
 does not queue up requests as most other utilities do; it transfers data while you watch.
 B and D are incorrect. Port 25 is used by SMTP and port 80 is used by HTTP.

Ping and Hping2
23. C. The Ping (Packet Internet Groper) command is the most-used TCP/IP troubleshooting
 tool available. This command is used to test a machine’s connectivity to the network and to
 verify that it is active. Usually, using this command is one of the first steps to any troubleshooting
 if a connectivity problem is occurring between two computers. This can quickly help you to
 determine whether a remote host is available and responsive.
 A and B are incorrect. Route is a command that we can use to view or modify the routing
 table in Windows. ARP is used to view or modify the ARP cache.
24. C. When troubleshooting connectivity to the Internet, you first check your TCP/IP
 settings and then ping the IP address of the default gateway to verify that the router is up and
 running.
 A, B, and D are incorrect. Although you may start pinging addresses, given that you are
 having trouble connecting to the Internet, you may want to start by pinging the router. Self Test Answers 349


25. D. In the output you can see that the address of 10.10.10.1 is sending responses back.
 There are four responses that are the four ping response messages.
 A, B, and C are incorrect. The output is coming from a Ping command to the IP address of
 10.10.10.1.

NSLOOKUP and DIG
26. D. NSLOOKUP. The NSLOOKUP utility is used to view and test the DNS database on
 the DNS server.
 A, B, and C are incorrect. Route is used to view or modify the routing table in Windows.
 ARP is used to view or modify the ARP cache. Ping is used to verify communications between
 two PCs.
27. C. To perform a reverse query with dig, you use the -x switch and then supply the IP
 address of the system you wish to know the name of.
 A, B, and D are incorrect because they are not the switches used to do a reverse query.

Other TCP/IP Utilities
28. A. The route utility is used to manage the local routing table. You can view the routing
 table with route print and add a route with route add.
 B, C, and D are not correct because they do not manage the local routing table of a system.
29. B. The hostname command is used to display the system name.
 A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not used to display the local system name.

Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities
30. B. You would ping the loopback address to verify that the TCP/IP software stack is
 installed and working.
 A, C, and D are incorrect because are not used to test the local system. You would use
 ARP to troubleshoot MAC address resolution problems, telnet to remotely connect to another
 system, and NSLOOKUP to troubleshoot DNS problems.
31. D. DNS is used to convert the FQDN, for example www.gleneclarke.com, to an IP address.
 A, B, and C are incorrect because they are not used to convert the FQDN to an IP address.
 WINS is used to convert the NetBIOS (computer name) to an IP address, telnet is used to
 remotely connect to another system, and FTP is a protocol to download files from a remote
 system. This page intentionally left blank 7

 T oday’s networks are no longer limited to using cabled, or wired, devices. Today’s
 networks have a mix of wired systems along with wireless systems that use radio
 frequencies to send data to a wireless access point (as shown in Figure 7-1). The
 wireless access point may have a connection to the wired network, allowing the wireless devices
 to communicate with the entire network.

 This chapter introduces you to the world of wireless networks! It is a very popular
 topic to know for the Network+ certification exam, so be sure to study this well.
 This chapter will introduce you to wireless basics, show you how to set up the
 wireless network, and then discuss some security concerns around wireless.

Wireless basics
 As mentioned, the wireless network uses radio frequencies to transmit data through
 the air. This means that if you have a laptop user who wishes to be mobile within
 the office, you can allow her to access the network through a wireless access point as
 long as she has a wireless network card in her laptop. Wireless Basics 353


 There are two types of wireless networks you can create: an ad hoc mode wireless
 network or an infrastructure mode wireless network. Each of these is known as a
 wireless mode, and each has its advantages.
 With ad hoc mode the wireless device, such as a laptop, is connected to other
 wireless devices in a peer-to-peer environment without the need for a wireless access
 point. With infrastructure mode, the wireless clients are connected to a central
 device, known as a wireless access point. The wireless client sends data to the access
 point, which then sends the data on to the destination (as shown in Figure 7-2).
 As mentioned previously, the wireless client can access network resources on the
 wired network once connected to the access point because the access point has a
 connection to the wired network.
 The advantage of ad hoc mode is that you don’t need to purchase the access
 point, but the benefit of infrastructure mode is that when you use the wireless access
 point you get to control who can connect to the wireless network and filter out types
 of network traffic. For example, if you use a wireless access point to allow wireless
 clients to connect to the Internet, you can control which web sites the users can
 connect to. This type of centralized control makes infrastructure mode extremely
 popular.

standards
 The IEEE committee has developed wireless standards in the 802 project models for
 wireless networking. Wireless is defined by the 802.11 project model and has several
 standards defined.

 802.11a
 The 802.11a wireless standard is an older one that runs at the 5 GHz frequency.
 802.11a devices can transmit data at 54 Mbps and are incompatible with 802.11b
 and 802.11g devices.

 802.11b
 The 802.11b wireless standard has a transfer rate of 11 Mbps while using a frequency
 of 2.4 GHz. These devices are compatible with 802.11g/n devices because they run
 at the same frequency and follow the WiFi standard.

 802.11g
 The 802.11g wireless standard is a newer one that was designed to be compatible
 with 802.11b but also increases the transfer rate. The transfer rate of 802.11g devices
 is 54 Mbps using a frequency of 2.4 GHz.
 All 802.11g devices are compatible with 802.11b/n devices because they all
 follow the WiFi standard and run at the same frequency of 2.4 GHz.

 support transfer rates up to 600 Mbps! To help accomplish this, 802.11n uses two new
 features: multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and channel bonding. MIMO is the use
 of multiple antennas to achieve more throughput than can be accomplished with
 only a single antenna. Channel bonding allows 802.11n to transmit data over two
 channels to achieve more throughput. 802.11n is designed to be backward compatible
 with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g and can run at the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency.

Channels
 It was stated that 802.11b/g/n all run at the 2.4 GHz frequency, but it is important to
 understand that 2.4 GHz is a frequency range. Each frequency in the range is known
 as a channel.
 Most wireless devices allow you to specify which channel you would like to use.
 The reason this is important is that if you find that you are having trouble with
 your wireless network failing a lot, then it could be that the wireless devices are
 conflicting, or interfering with other wireless devices in your area. A good example
 of this is cordless phones; they run at the 2.4 GHz range as well and could cause
 issues with your wireless network. As a solution you could change the channel on
 your wireless access point and clients, which changes the frequency—hopefully
 preventing any conflicts with other household items!




 To avoid interference on problems on the wireless network, you
 the wireless network from other household could try changing the channel on the
 items, try to purchase items like cordless wireless equipment and see if a different
 phones that run on a different frequency channel is more reliable.
 than 2.4 GHz. If you are experiencing



 Table 7-2 lists the different frequencies used by the different channels.
 Remember when troubleshooting wireless networks that you could be getting
 interference from other wireless devices and household devices running on the
 same channel. As a fix, experiment by changing the channel used by your wireless
 network to reduce the amount of interference received. As noted in Table 7-2,
 adjacent channels have overlapping frequencies and will interfere with one another,
 so changing from channel 2 to channel 1 will not solve interference problems, but
 changing from channel 2 to channel 6 might.


authentication and encryption
 A number of wireless authentication and encryption protocols have been developed
 over the years. The purpose of these protocols is to help secure your wireless network,
 and you should consider them for implementation on your wireless network. Wireless Basics 357

 WeP
 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was designed to give the wireless world a level of
 security that could equate to what the wired networking world has. In the wired
 world, someone would have to be in your office to connect a cable to your network,
 but with wireless networking this is not the case. Someone could sit outside your
 building in a parked car and connect to your wireless network. WEP was designed to
 add security to wireless networks.
 To configure your wireless network with
 WEP, you simply specify a shared key, or
 passphrase, on the wireless access point. The
 theory is that if anyone wants to connect to
 WEP can use 64-bit or your wireless network, he needs to know the
 128-bit encryption keys that are made up shared key and configure his workstation with
 of a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) and that key.
 then a 40-bit key (for 64-bit encryption) When you configure the shared key on the
 or a 104-bit key (for 128-bit encryption). access point and client, any data sent between
 the client and the access point is encrypted with 358 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking



 WEP. This will prevent unauthorized individuals from capturing data in transit and
 being able to read the data.
 It is important to understand that there were huge flaws in how WEP implemented
 its encryption and key usage, and as a result both 64-bit and 128-bit WEP have been
 cracked. For security reasons, you should not use WEP unless you have older access
 points that do not support WPA or WPA2.

 WPa
 WiFi Protected Access (WPA) was designed to improve upon security and fix some
 of the flaws found in WEP. WPA uses a 128-bit key and the Temporal Key Integrity
 Protocol (TKIP), which is a protocol that is used to change the keys used for
 encryption for every packet that is sent. This will make it much harder for hackers
 to crack the key, which is very easy to do with WEP.
 WPA had a number of other improvements over WEP; for example, it has improved
 integrity checking and it supports authentication using the Extensible Authentication
 Protocol (EAP), a very secure authentication protocol.
 WPA operates in two different modes, WPA-Personal and WPA-Enterprise.

 n WPA-Personal WPA-Personal is also known as WPA-PSK, which means
 WPA preshared key. With WPA-Personal you will configure the access
 point with a starting key value, known as the preshared key, which is then
 used to encrypt the traffic. This mode is used most by home users and small
 businesses.
 n WPA-Enterprise WPA-Enterprise, also known as WPA-802.1x, is a WPA
 implementation that uses a central authentication server such as a RADIUS
 server for authentication and auditing features. WPA-Enterprise is used by
 larger companies so that they can use their existing authentication server to
 control who has access to the wireless network and to log network access.


 In order to use WPA, you will need to have devices that support WPA. If you
 have older wireless cards or access points, they may only support WEP.


 WPa2
 WPA2 improves upon the security of WPA and should be used instead of WPA if
 you have the choice. WPA2 uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol Securing Wireless 359


 instead of TKIP and also supports a number of additional features such as added
 protection for ad hoc networks and key caching.
 Because WPA2 uses AES as its encryption protocol it supports 128-bit, 192-bit, or
 256-bit encryption.




 Be sure to be familiar and encryption protocols for the
 with the different wireless authentication Network+ exam.

securing Wireless
 A few years ago when I purchased my first wireless router, I knew nothing about
 wireless and was concerned that I would not be able to set up the wireless network.
 Well, my concerns were quickly dismissed when I took the wireless router (access
 point) out of the box and gave it power. My laptop connected almost immediately!
 I was amazed at how easy it was to connect to the wireless network—there was
 no configuration required. Then it dawned on me—if my laptop connected with
 no configuration, what is stopping the rest of the world from connecting to my
 wireless network? The answer of course is that nothing is stopping someone from
 sitting outside my yard and connecting to my wireless network. I needed to figure
 out how to stop unauthorized access to my wireless access point.
 There are a number of different techniques that you can use to prevent
 unauthorized persons from connecting to your wireless network. You may want to
 implement some or all of these features. To help secure your wireless infrastructure,
 you should consider changing settings on the router such as the admin password,
 the SSID, and MAC filtering, to name a few. The following are some basic best
 practices that you should follow to secure your wireless router. You can see the
 steps to configure these features in the later section “Implementing a Wireless
 Network.” 360 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking



 Change admin Password
 The first thing you should do when you take the wireless router out of the box and
 plug it in is change the admin password. The admin password is needed to connect
 to the web administration pages and change the settings of the router. All routers
 have a default admin password, so you want to be sure to change the password from
 the default.
 Figure 7-3 displays how to change the admin password on a D-Link router by
 going to the Tools link at the top and then choosing the Admin link on the left.

 service set identifier (ssiD)
 The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a name that you give the wireless network, and in
 order for someone to connect to your wireless network, that person needs to know
 the SSID. Any client who wishes to connect to your wireless network will need to
 specify the SSID name in their wireless network card settings. It is important that
 you change the SSID from the default so that anyone wishing to connect to your
 wireless network would need to know the name, or SSID.
 The problem is that wireless routers are configured to advertise this SSID
 automatically; so even if you change the SSID to something hard to guess, the router
 advertises the name out. This means an individual can connect to your network
 by name without really knowing the name of the network because the router is
 advertising it. Proof of this is shown when you choose the option in Windows XP
 or Windows Vista to connect to a network and a dialog box displays (shown in
 Figure 7-4) showing you all the wireless networks close to you.

 To fix this, you should configure your router
 to not advertise the SSID. This will prevent the
 Windows users from displaying a list of wireless
 You can use a tool such networks and having your network display in
 as NetStumbler to do a wireless survey the list. Figure 7-5 displays how to disable SSID
 to get a list of wireless networks that are broadcasting on a D-Link wireless router (set the
 close to you. Visibility Status to Invisible). Most routers have
 this as a setting “Disable SSID broadcasting.”

 So to summarize the SSID issue, be sure to change the SSID to something hard
 to guess (don’t use your company name if you are setting up the wireless network for
 the company) and be sure to disable SSID broadcasting on the router.

 Although this chapter is giving you a number of best practices to make it
 harder for someone to compromise your wireless network, know that most of
 the security measures have been compromised. For example, when you disable
 SSID broadcasting, Windows and most wireless scanners such as NetStumbler
 will not pick up on the wireless network, but tools such as Kismet in Linux can.



 MaC address filtering
 Most wireless networks allow you to limit which wireless network cards can connect
 to the wireless access point. You can limit systems that can connect to your wireless
 network by finding out the MAC addresses of the systems you want to allow to
 connect and then configuring the router to deny traffic from all systems except the
 MAC addresses you input (see Figure 7-6). This is known as MAC address filtering.
 By default, wireless access points are not configured for MAC address filtering, so
 you want to make sure that you configure it. Be aware that MAC filtering by itself
 will not keep the determined hacker out. A determined hacker can monitor traffic
 in the air, see the MAC address of an authorized client, and then spoof that address
 so that the hacker’s traffic is allowed.


 figure 7-6

Configuring MAC
filtering Securing Wireless 363


encrypt Wireless traffic
You will want to ensure that you are encrypting any traffic from the wireless clients
to the access point. You can use WEP, WPA, or WPA2 to encrypt traffic. Remember
to use the more secure WPA or WPA2 if you can. To stress the importance of
implementing some level of encryption, let’s review WEP.
 WEP is a feature used to encrypt content between the wireless client and the
access point. When configuring WEP, you must configure the wireless access point
with an encryption key and then make sure that each wireless client is using the
same key. Be aware that WEP encryption has been cracked with products such
as AirSnort, so if your devices support WPA or WPA2, then use one of those
encryption methods. Always use the largest encryption cipher strength your wireless
access point and wireless cards support (for example, 128 bit versus 64 bit).
 The other point to make about using WEP or WPA is that not only does it
encrypt your traffic but anyone who wishes to connect to your wireless network must
know the key and input the key into their wireless card configuration. This helps
ensure that people not authorized to use the wireless network cannot connect to the
wireless network.

vPn solutions
Most companies have security concerns with using wireless, and for good reason.
Hackers can bypass the MAC filtering, they can crack the WEP key, and they can
use Kismet to discover wireless networks even when SSID broadcasting is disabled—
so how do you ensure the security of the wireless network?
 Most large companies that are using wireless and have security needs of the
utmost importance are using VPN solutions with their wireless clients. They are
treating the wireless client like any other remote user—“if you want access to the
network when not on the premises, you need to connect through VPN”—that is
their position. This is due to the high level of security that VPN solutions offer.
 In a typical VPN solution for wireless clients, the wireless client would first
connect to the wireless network. The wireless network may have some of the
security precautions we discussed implemented, such as SSID broadcasting disabled,
WEP/WPA, or MAC filtering. The bottom line is if an authorized wireless client
connects to the wireless network, that is not where the company network is. After
connecting to the wireless network and getting an IP address, the wireless client
will then VPN into the network with the VPN software. The VPN software will
authenticate the user and also create an encrypted tunnel to secure data transmitting
from the client to the corporate network. 364 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking



 If securing wireless is a concern in your organization, look to using a VPN
 solution to secure wireless.

 Now that you have an understanding of some of the basic concepts to configure
 wireless, let’s take a look at how to configure a wireless network.

implementing a Wireless network
 In this section you will learn the steps to configure your wireless access point and the
 wireless client. Be sure to familiarize yourself with types of settings that exist, but be
 aware that the screens and steps will be different with different makes and models of
 wireless routers.


Configuring the access Point
 When you take the wireless access point, or router, out of the box, you will first
 connect your Internet modem to the WAN port on the wireless router. You can then
 connect any wired systems on the network to any of the four ports that exist on the
 switch part of the router as shown in Figure 7-7.

 Once you have everything connected, and the router has power, you will need
 to go through some basic configuration steps to ensure the security of the device.
 I want to stress that by just plugging everything in the wireless router is working
 and allowing wireless clients to access the network. You want to control who can
 connect to the wireless network! The following section outlines some basic settings
 you can change.

 admin Password
 The first thing you will want to do is change the wireless router’s administrative
 password. This password is set by default by the manufacturer, and anyone who has
 the same router will know the password. In order to change the admin password, you
 will need to start a web browser and type the IP address of the wireless router. The IP
 address is normally 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1, depending on the manufacturer.
 Once you type in the IP address, you will be asked to log on. In my example I am
 using a D-Link DIR-615 wireless router, so the password is blank when you take it
 out of the box. To log on to the router, ensure that admin is chosen as the username
 and type your password or leave it blank if you don’t know the password. Click the
 Log In button as shown in Figure 7-8 and you will be logged on.
 Once logged on, you will change the admin password by going to the Tools link
 at the top of the page and then selecting the Admin link on the left side of the page
 (shown in Figure 7-9). In the Admin Password section of the page you will type the
 password you would like to use for the admin account and then retype it in the verify
 box. Once you have both password boxes filled in, then you can click the Save
 Settings button at the top of the page.

 service set identifier
 After changing your router admin password, you will want to change the name of
 the wireless network, known as the SSID. Remember that in order to connect to
 your wireless network, clients have to know the value of the SSID. To change the
 SSID on the D-Link router, click the Setup link at the top of the page and then
 choose the Wireless Settings link on the left. You can then choose to configure
 the wireless network settings manually by scrolling to the bottom of the page and
 choosing the Manual Wireless Network Setup button.
 You are then placed in the wireless networking setup screen (as shown in
 Figure 7-10), where you can change most wireless network settings. To change the
 SSID name, type the name you would like to use in the “Wireless Network Name”
 box and then click Save Settings.
 After changing the value of the SSID, you next want to disable SSID
 broadcasting so that your router does not broadcast the name out on the network
 to anyone who wants to connect to it. To disable SSID broadcasting on the D-Link
 wireless router, set the Visibility Status to invisible and then choose Save Settings
 (see Figure 7-10). Implementing a Wireless Network 367


 figure 7-10

Changing the

(SSID)




 Now that you have SSID broadcasting disabled, users that want to connect to
 your network will not see the wireless network through Windows XP/Vista unless
 they manually input the SSID name.
 While you are looking at the wireless network settings on the router, take a
 look at the channel that the wireless network is using. In my example, the router is
 autopicking the channel, and you can see in Figure 7-11 that the router has selected
 channel 11. If you wish to change the channel used by your wireless network, disable
 the Auto Channel Scan check box and then you can pick which channel you wish
 to use.

 MaC filtering
 The next step to help secure the wireless network is to enable MAC filtering.
 Remember that MAC filtering allows you to input the MAC addresses of the
 wireless network cards you want to connect to your wireless network. Systems using
 any other MAC addresses will not be able to connect to the wireless network.


 figure 7-11

Choosing a
different channel
to use for the

 To configure MAC filtering on a D-Link DIR-615 router, you simply click the
 Advanced link at the top of the page and then choose the Network Filter link on
 the left. Choose to turn MAC filtering on from the drop-down list (as shown in
 Figure 7-12) and then list the MAC addresses that are allowed to connect to the
 network.

 Wireless security
 As part of securing a wireless router, the first thing you may decide to do is to
 disable the wireless aspect of the router if you are not using wireless. A number of
 people purchase the wireless router and don’t actually have any wireless clients at
 the time—the best thing to do in this case is disable wireless functionality until you
 need it.
 To disable the wireless features on the D-Link router, go to the Setup link at the
 top of the page and then choose Wireless Settings on the left. At the bottom of the
 page choose Manual Wireless Network Setup. Once in the wireless settings turn off
 the Enable Wireless option as shown in Figure 7-13. Also notice that there is an
 Add New button to the right. This allows you to create a schedule, specifying the
 times during the day that the wireless is allowed if you want to control the wireless
 time instead of disabling the feature entirely.

 As mentioned earlier, you will want to configure some form of encryption on the
 wireless router. Most wireless routers will allow you to configure WEP or WPA to
 encrypt traffic between the client and wireless access point. Also remember that the
 WEP or WPA key must be inputted at the client in order for the client to connect to
 the wireless network.

 Configure WeP To configure WEP on the D-Link router, be sure to first log on
 to the router. Once you have logged on, click the Setup link at the top of the page
 and then the Wireless Settings on the left. Then scroll to the bottom of the page and
 choose Manual Wireless Network Setup. Once in the wireless configuration screen,
 choose WEP in the Security Mode drop-down list at the bottom of the page. You
 will then get options to configure WEP; for instance, you can specify the encryption
 strength (such as 128 bit) and then supply four encryption keys of thirteen charac-
 ters each Figure 7-14 displays WEP being enabled.
 Once you have enabled WEP on the wireless access point, you will then need to
 configure the wireless clients for WEP (shown later in this chapter).

 Configure WPa To configure WPA on the D-Link wireless router, you will fol-
 low very similar steps. Once you have logged on to the router, click the Setup link
 at the top of the page and then the Wireless Settings on the left. Then scroll to the
 bottom of the page and choose Manual Wireless Network Setup.
 Once in the wireless configuration screen, choose WPA-Personal in the Security
 Mode drop-down list at the bottom of the page. If you are using a central Radius
 server for authentication with WPA, then choose WPA-Enterprise in the Security
 Mode drop-down list. 370 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking




 figure 7-14

Enabling WEP
security on a

 Once you choose WPA-Personal (shown in Figure 7-15), you can then choose
 below whether you want to support WPA,WPA2, or both. You can also choose
 which protocol you wish to use, AES being the most secure encryption protocol.
 With WPA you can also specify how often the key changes with the group key
 interval.

 Controlling internet sites
 Most wireless routers today allow you to control Internet activity such as what times
 of the day the Internet is allowed to be used and what Internet sites are allowed to
 be visited.
 There are a number of sites that you may want to block so that your users
 cannot visit the site. It may be something as simple as a small company using the Implementing a Wireless Network 371

 wireless router not wanting its employees wasting company time on a site such as
 facebook.com, or you may want to block inappropriate sites.
 The following steps will guide you through blocking a specific web site on the
 router so that users cannot visit the site:

 1. Log on to the router.
 2. Go to the Advanced menu at the top of the page.
 3. Click the Website Filter on the left side of the page.
 4. Type the URL you would like to block (shown in Figure 7-16). This will
 prevent users on your network from accessing this site.
 5. Now you will have to create a policy that enforces your web site filter at all
 hours of the day. To do this, click the Advanced link at the top and then
 choose the Access Control link on the left. 372 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking

 10. Choose Always for when this policy applies and then click Next.
 11. Choose Other Machines so that the policy applies to all systems and then
 click OK.
 12. Click Next.
 13. Choose Block Some Access and then ensure the Web Filter option is selected
 so that the web filter is applied (shown in Figure 7-17).
 14. Click Next.
 15. Ensure that Web Access Logging is enabled. This will allow you to log what
 sites your users are visiting. After you enable logging, you can view the log at
 any time to see what sites are being visited.
 16. Click Save to save the access policy. Implementing a Wireless Network 373

 view Web activity
 Once you have enabled logging of web activity, you will want to check the logs once
 in a while. Most routers allow you to view a list of sites that your users have been
 visiting, or in the case of the D-Link DIR-615 router you can have the log e-mailed
 to you if you configure the e-mail settings.
 To view the log on the router, go to the Status link at the top of the page and
 then click the Log link on the left. You will see the logged activity for your router in
 the middle of the screen (shown in Figure 7-18).

Configuring the Client
 Once your wireless router has been configured, you are now ready to connect the
 wireless clients to the network. In order to connect the wireless clients to the network,
 you want to ensure you have the following information before you get started:

 n SSID Name Because you have most likely disabled SSID broadcasting, you
 will need to know the SSID so that you can manually input it into the client.
 n WEP or WPA Key If you have protected the wireless network with WEP
 or WPA, you will need to know the key.
 n MAC Address of Client If you are filtering by MAC addresses, you will
 need to know the MAC of your client and then input that MAC address into
 the router.

 Once you have all the information in the bulleted list, then you are ready to
 connect the clients to the wireless network. This section will outline the steps
 needed to allow your client systems to connect to the wireless network.

 Connecting a Windows XP Client
 In order to connect your Windows XP client to a wireless network, you will first
 need to ensure that your wireless network card driver is installed. Once your wireless
 network card driver is installed, then you can connect to a wireless network by
 following these steps:

 1. Click Start and choose Control Panel.
 2. Choose Network Connections.
 3. Right-click your wireless connect and then choose View Available Wireless
 Networks.
 4. A list of wireless networks displays (as shown in Figure 7-19).
 5. If you see the wireless network you wish to connect to, highlight the network
 and then choose Connect. You will be prompted for the wireless key if one is
 configured.
 6. If the wireless network you wish to connect to has SSID broadcasting
 disabled, then you will configure a manual connection and specify the name
 of the wireless network. To do this, click the Change Advanced Settings link
 on the left.
 7. Choose the Wireless Networks page tab at the top of the dialog box. Implementing a Wireless Network 375

network in
Windows 376 Chapter 7: Wireless Networking



 11. Type the WEP key in the field provided.
 12. Click OK.

 Once the client has been configured, you should then be able to access the
 wireless network and access network resources and the Internet.
 Connecting a vista Client
 If you are using Windows Vista, you can connect to the wireless network in a
 similar fashion or you can use the wireless network icon in the system tray. Click
 the wireless network icon in the system tray to see what network you are connected
 to. If you would like to connect to a different network, you can click the Connect
 Or Disconnect option as shown in Figure 7-21.
 Once you have chosen to connect to a different network, then a list of available
 wireless networks appears (shown in Figure 7-22). Remember that any networks that
 have disabled SSID broadcasting will not appear in this list.


 figure 7-21

 If the wireless network you wish to connect to doesn’t appear in the list because
 SSID broadcasting is disabled, then you will choose the “Set up a connection or
 network” option and then choose “Manually connect to a wireless network.” This will
 bring you to a dialog box where you can type the SSID name of the wireless network
 you want to connect to. You can also specify whether the network is using WEP, WPA,
 or WPA2. You can also specify the key information here as well (shown in Figure 7-23).
 When troubleshooting why a client will not connect to wireless networks, there
 are a number of issues to consider. The following is a list of popular problems when
 connecting to wireless:

 n Interference You could be getting interference from other home equipment,
 such as a cordless phone. Try changing the channel on the Wireless network.
 n Incorrect encryption You could be using the wrong encryption type or even
 the wrong encryption key. Verify all encryption settings.
 n Incorrect channel or frequency You could be using the wrong channel to
 connect to the wireless network. Verify the channel settings.
 n Extended Service Set ID (ESSID) mismatch ESSID is another name for
 SSID. You must input the correct ESSID name in order to connect to the
 wireless network.
 n Standard mismatch (802.11a/b/g/n) Be sure that the wireless device you
 are using is compatible with the wireless network.
 n Distance and bounce If you are too far from the wireless network, you may not
 have a strong enough signal to connect. Try moving closer to the access point.
 n Incorrect antenna placement Be sure to place the antenna in an open area
 that will get the best coverage. Try placing it up high, such as on a bookshelf.

infrared and bluetooth
 Today’s wireless network environments are not limited only to 802.11 wireless LAN
 equipment. As a Network+ professional, you should be familiar with other popular
 wireless standards such as infrared and Bluetooth.


infrared
 Infrared wireless is the type of wireless communication that is used by VCR and
 TV remote controls, along with some computer peripherals. Infrared is typically a
 line-of-sight technology, which means that the signal is lost if anything blocks the
 pathway between the two devices. With infrared, the two devices will need to be
 within one meter of one another.
 Infrared devices contain a transceiver that sends and receives light signals as
 on-off patterns to create the data that travels at transfer rates up to 4 Mbps. Because
 line of sight is required, you may need to use a radio frequency solution such as
 Bluetooth if line of sight becomes an issue.


bluetooth
 Bluetooth is a radio frequency wireless technology that allows systems to connect to
 peripherals over a distance of up to 10 meters away. Bluetooth is more flexible than
 infrared because it will automatically connect to other Bluetooth devices and does
 not depend on line of sight. This is a popular technology used by handheld devices
 to connect to other networking components.
 Bluetooth is less susceptible to interference because it uses spread-spectrum
 frequency hopping, which means that it can hop between any of 79 frequencies in
 the 2.4 GHz range. Bluetooth hops between frequencies 1600 times per second and
 provides a transfer rate of up to 1 Mbps.
 Bluetooth is a popular technology with handheld devices such as PDAs and cell
 phones. Bluetooth is popular with these devices so that users can use their wireless
 headsets with their cell phones and talk “hands free.” Certification Summary 379


 There are huge security risks with Bluetooth, as it is possible for a hacker to
 connect to your cell phone remotely via Bluetooth and steal data off your phone. In
 order to secure your Bluetooth-enabled device, follow these best practices:

 n Disable Bluetooth If you are not using the Bluetooth feature on your
 phone, then disable Bluetooth through the phone’s menu system.
 n Phone Visibility If you are using Bluetooth, then set the phone’s visibility
 setting to invisible so that hackers cannot pick up on your phone with a
 Bluetooth scanner.
 n Pair Security Ensure you are using a Bluetooth phone that uses pair security,
 which allows people to connect to your phone only if they know the PIN
 code you have set on the phone.



CertifiCation suMMary
 In this chapter you have learned about wireless basics and the security issues
 surrounding wireless. You have learned that wireless networks come in two forms,
 infrastructure mode or ad hoc mode. Infrastructure mode uses a wireless access point,
 while ad hoc mode allows clients to connect to one another.
 You have also learned about wireless standards such as 802.11b, 802.11g, and
 802.11n. 802.11b is an old wireless standard that runs at 11 Mbps, while 802.11g
 runs at 54 Mbps and 802.11n runs at over 300Mbps.
 You have learned that there are many steps to securing a wireless network, such as
 limiting which systems can connect through MAC filtering, encrypting traffic with
 WEP or WPA, and making sure to change the SSID and disable SSID broadcasting.
 You have learned that all these measures have been compromised by hackers, so if
 security is a concern you should look to using a VPN solution with your wireless

 B ecause of the expansion of networks in the world today, user demands for connectivity
 are increasing dramatically. Users require the ability to connect to network resources
 from remote locations, at home, and across the Internet. This chapter will introduce you
 to a number of methods to allow remote users to connect to the network.

 As companies expanded and joined an increasingly global market, the need to
 interconnect offices became crucial to business operations. The Internet is now
 based on this concept: making information accessible to anyone in the world, from
 any location. To enable remote installations to communicate with each other and
 to provide redundancy in case of war, the U.S. government created ARPANET,
 the first truly remote network. As ARPANET began its transformation into what
 is now known as the Internet, universities began using it to interconnect and share
 information and resources. Now, a large portion of the world population uses the
 Internet for information exchange and research.
 Today, companies use networks to interconnect remote sites. They also provide
 dial-up access to their users to enable them to connect from home or from hotels
 while on the road. This increased connectivity helps increase productivity and
 allows the use of additional communication channels. Many technologies we take
 for granted today implement these concepts. For example, telephone systems use
 complex networks to enable us to call almost anyone in the world. E-mail is used to
 send messages and files through the Internet to reach anyone who has access to these
 services. As with any technology that we come to depend on, remote connectivity
 has become a part of our everyday lives.
 Companies also use features such as Terminal Services or Remote Desktop to
 connect to systems over a TCP/IP connection and remotely manage those systems
 or run applications from a particular system. Terminal Services has become a core
 network service that is required by most organizations and is discussed in this chapter.

remote Connectivity Concepts
 Many technologies and functions are used for remote connectivity. One of the
 first networks—the telephone system—is still used today by almost everyone in Remote Connectivity Concepts 389


 the world. The telephone system concept was based on the idea of enabling two
 people in different physical locations to speak with each other. The same basic
 idea is used today for many different applications. Global networks have been
 created by corporations and institutions alike to enable remote communication and
 information sharing.
 The basic functionality of remote connectivity is available in many different
 protocols and devices. For example, companies use network links such as Frame
 Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), which encompass many
 different technologies. More common applications include Remote Access
 Service (RAS), which allows a remote user to use a protocol such as the Point-
 to-Point Protocol (PPP) to dial in to the RAS server over the public switched
 telephone network (PSTN).
 This chapter will first introduce you to types of connections such as PSTN
 and ISDN and then talk about RAS services and protocols for dial-up using those
 connection types. The chapter will then focus on VPN-type connections and
 protocols as an alternative way to connect to a remote network.


Public switched telephone network (Pstn)
 Almost everyone in the world has used a telephone at least once. Today, you can
 call anywhere in the world and get a direct connection almost instantly using this
 technology. The PSTN was originally designed as an analog switching system for
 routing voice calls. Because it has existed for several decades and has been used by
 so many, it has come to be known as plain old telephone service (POTS). Because
 PSTN is considered the first wide area network, it was the basis for many of the
 WAN technologies that exist today and has been instrumental in their evolution.

 a History of Pstn
 During the initial years of PSTN, digital technologies had not even been considered.
 The telephone network was based purely on analog signals traveling across copper
 wire to transport a human voice. The only repetitions of the signal that might have
 occurred were through one or two repeater devices. The term via net loss (VNL)
 was coined to calculate the signal degradation that occurred. This degradation was
 measured in decibels (dB). The only metering equipment needed to test connections
 consisted of test tones, decibel meters, and volume unit (VU) meters. VU meters
 were used to measure complex signals such as the human voice. These meters simply
 measure the loss or gain of a specific circuit. 390 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 Prior to the 1960s, PSTN lines could handle nothing more than what they were
 originally designed for—voice communication. Since then, many great technology
 leaps have helped the network progress. The beginning of this era was marked by
 the advent of the Bell T1 transmission system. As T1s became more frequently used
 in the telephone network, bandwidth and quality increased. This advent also began
 the true migration from using human operators to route calls to switching these
 functions electronically.
 In the 1970s and 1980s, the phone companies began to invest more resources in
 improving the quality of the PSTN backbone. This backbone, also known as the
 digital access cross-connect system (DACCS), was a combination of all the T1 and
 T3 lines. Although many problems were associated with DACCS at that time, it
 provided a technology upgrade to help improve services all the way around. Soon
 companies started looking at PSTN lines as an alternative to the dedicated point-to-
 point links they were using.
 As the industry started to move in the direction of PSTN lines, manufacturers
 began to market modems for this purpose. As modems became more commonplace,
 the manufacturers began mass-marketing them for everyday users. Today, although
 using a modem to dial in to a remote network is not as common as connecting
 through a broadband connection, it is still an important option for persons not
 having broadband technologies available. People in rural areas may still need to rely
 on PSTN and some companies may still rely on using PSTN lines to enable remote
 users to dial in to private networks as well as to back up data links for computer
 systems that require remote connectivity.

 How Pstn Works
 The POTS network originally began with human operators sitting at a switch,
 manually routing calls. The original concept of the Bell Telephone system was a
 series of PSTN trunks connecting the major U.S. cities. This was an analog-based
 system that met its requirements for human voice transmissions at the time. Since
 the inception of the telephone, the world has changed. PSTN systems still use
 analog from the end node to the first switch. Once the signal is received, the switch
 converts the signal to a digital format and then routes the call on. Once the call is
 received on the other end, the last switch in the loop converts the signal back to
 analog, and the call is initiated. Because the end node is still analog, modems are
 used in most homes to facilitate dial-up access. Faster technologies such as ISDN or
 T1s use a dedicated point-to-point link through a completely digital path, making
 higher bandwidths attainable. Currently, analog lines can reach only a maximum Remote Connectivity Concepts 391


 speed of 56 Kbps. Using digital lines, speeds in excess of 2 Gbps (gigabits per second)
 can be reached.
 The telephone network works much like the TCP transport protocol. It is
 connection based, and the connection is maintained until the call is terminated.
 This enables you to hear the other person
 almost instantaneously. Telephone networks
 use two copper wires in most homes, but the
 switching medium is mainly fiber. This allows

 because of the modem device connected to the
 system.

 Modem types
 Analog modems are used to connect to a remote network via a PSTN line.
 Although there are many different types and makes of modems, they can be
 categorized into three classes: single external, single internal, and multiline rack or
 shelf-mounted.
 The external modem is the modem most commonly used today. Many ISPs use
 pools of external modems to enable dial-in access. These modems are also common
 in server hardware. Many IT workers include modems in production systems to allow
 for a backup communications link or for remote access.
 The internal modem belongs to the same device type as the external modem.
 The only real difference is that it is located inside the computer chassis. Most
 companies no longer use these modems, because externals are easier to replace
 and troubleshoot. For example, internal modems do not have the light-emitting
 diodes (LEDs) that external modems have. This translates into a headache if you
 have to figure out why the modem won’t connect to a remote host via the dial-
 up connection. Some modem manufacturers provide software interfaces, but they
 are generally not as full-featured as those in external modems. A common use for
 internal modems is in laptop computers using PC (PCMCIA) cards. Many laptop
 vendors still integrate phone jacks into the chassis of their computers. In addition,
 PC cards can technically be classified as internal modems. These are used widely and
 do not include the LEDs or lamps an external modem offers. Quite a few businesses
 use external modems, and home users use internal modems. The cost difference is
 almost negligible, but home users usually opt for the cheaper of the two. 392 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 These solutions are becoming increasingly popular. Many vendors offer solutions
 that have a single chassis containing a certain number of modem cards that can
 be connected directly to the network. The modularity and size of these devices
 makes them much more efficient than trying to maintain a shelf with a stack of
 external modems sitting on it. These solutions have also been included in some new
 networking equipment. Manufacturers place analog modems in their equipment to
 facilitate redundancy features such as a backup network link.


integrated services Digital network (isDn)
 In the past, the phone network consisted of an interconnection of wires that
 directly connected telephone users via an analog-based system. This system was very
 inefficient because it did not work well for long-distance connections and was very
 prone to “noise.” In the 1960s, the telephone company began converting this system
 to a packet-based, digital switching network. Today, nearly all voice switching in the
 United States is digital; however, the customer connection to the switching office is
 primarily still analog.
 The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a system of digital telephone
 connections that enables data to be transmitted simultaneously end to end. This
 technology has been available for more than a decade and is designed to enable
 faster, clearer communications for small offices and home users. It came about as
 the standard telephone system began its migration from an analog format to digital.
 ISDN is the format portion of the digital telephone system now being used to
 replace analog systems.

 a History of isDn
 The concept of ISDN was introduced in 1972. The concept was based on moving
 the analog-to-digital conversion equipment onto the customer’s premises to enable
 voice and data services to be sent through a single line. Telephone companies also
 began using a new kind of digital communications link between each central office.
 A T1 link could carry twenty-four 64 Kbps voice channels, and it used the same
 amount of copper wire as only two analog voice calls. Throughout the 1970s, the
 telephone companies continued to upgrade their switching offices. They began
 rolling out T1 links directly to customers to provide high-speed access. The need for
 an efficient solution was greater than ever.
 In the early 1990s, an effort was begun to establish a standard implementation
 for ISDN in the United States. The National ISDN 1 (NI-1) standard was defined Remote Connectivity Concepts 393


by the industry so that users would not have to know the type of switch they were
connected to in order to buy equipment and software compatible with it.
 Because some major office switches were incompatible with this standard, some
major telephone companies had trouble switching to the NI-1 standard. This caused
a number of problems in trying to communicate between these nonstandard systems
and everyone else. Eventually, all the systems were brought up to standard. A set
of core services was defined in all basic rate interfaces (BRIs) of the NI-1 standard.
The services include data-call services, voice-call services, call forwarding, and call
waiting. Most devices today conform to the NI-1 standard.
 A more comprehensive standardization initiative, National ISDN 2 (NI-2),
was recently adopted. Now, several major manufacturers of networking equipment
have become involved to help set the standard and make ISDN a more economical
solution. The NI-2 standard had two goals: to standardize the primary rate interface
(PRI) as NI-1 did for BRI, and to simplify the identification process. Until this
point, PRIs were mainly vendor-dependent, which made it difficult to interconnect
them. Furthermore, a standard was created for NI-2 for identifiers.

isDn Channels
An ISDN transmission circuit consists of a logical grouping of data channels. With
ISDN, voice and data are carried by these channels. Two types of channels, a B
channel and a D channel, are used for a single ISDN connection. Each channel
has a specific function and bandwidth associated with it. The bearer channels, or
B channels, transfer data. They offer a bandwidth of 64 Kbps per channel.
 The data channel, or D channel, handles signaling at 16 Kbps or 64 Kbps. This
includes the session setup and teardown using a communications language known as
DSS1. The purpose of the D channel is to enable the B channels to strictly pass data
and not have to worry about signaling information. You remove the administrative
overhead from B channels using the D channel. The bandwidth available for the D
channel depends on the type of ISDN service; BRIs usually require 16 Kbps and PRIs
use 64 Kbps. Typically, ISDN service contains two B channels and a single D channel.
 H channels are used to specify a number of B channels. The following list shows
the implementations:

 n H0 384 Kbps (6 B channels)
 n H10 1472 Kbps (23 B channels)
 n H11 1536 Kbps (24 B channels)
 n H12 1920 Kbps (30 B channels, the European standard) 394 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 isDn interfaces
 Although B channels and D channels can be combined in any number of ways, the
 phone companies created two standard configurations. There are two basic types of
 ISDN service: BRI and PRI.

 n Basic Rate Interface (BRI) BRI consists of two 64 Kbps B channels and
 one 16 Kbps D channel, for a total of 144 Kbps. With BRI, only 128 Kbps
 is used for data transfers, while the remaining 16 Kbps is used for signaling
 information. BRIs were designed to enable customers to use their existing
 wiring. Because this provided a low-cost solution for customers, it is the most
 basic type of service intended for small business or home use.
 n Primary Rate Interface (PRI) PRI is intended for users that need greater
 bandwidth. It requires T1 carriers to facilitate communications. Normally,
 the channel structure contains twenty-three B channels plus one 64 Kbps
 D channel for a total of 1536 Kbps. This standard is used only in North
 America and Japan. European countries support a different kind of ISDN
 standard for PRI. It consists of 30 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel, for
 a total of 1984 Kbps. A technology known as non-facility associated signaling
 (NFAS) is available to enable support of multiple PRI lines with one 64 Kbps
 D channel.
 To use BRI services, you must subscribe
 to ISDN services through a local telephone
 company or provider. By default, you must be
 within 18,000 feet (about 3.4 miles) of the

 devices. You must have an ISDN terminal
 adapter and an ISDN router.

 isDn Devices
 The phrase ISDN standard refers to the devices that are required to connect the
 end node to the network. Although some vendors provide devices that include Remote Connectivity Concepts 395


 several functions, a separate device defines each function within the standard. The
 protocols that each device uses are also defined and are associated with a specific
 letter. Also known as reference points, these letters are R, S, T, and U. ISDN
 standards also define the device types. They are NT1, NT2, TE1, TE2, and TA.
 The architecture for these devices and the reference points are shown in Figure 8-1
 and are explained in the following section.

 isDn reference Points
 Reference points are used to define logical interfaces. They are, in effect, a type of
 protocol used in communications. The following list contains the reference points:

 n R Defines the reference point between a TE2 device and a TA device.
 n S Defines the reference point between TE1 devices and NT1 or NT2 devices.
 n T Defines the reference point between NT1 and NT2 devices.
 n U Defines the reference point between NT1 devices and line termination
 equipment. This is usually the central switch.

 Network terminator 1 (NT1) is the device that communicates directly with
 the central office switch. The NT1 receives a U-interface connection from the
 telephone company and puts out a T-interface connection for the NT2. NT1
 handles the physical layer portions of the connection, such as physical and electrical
 termination, line monitoring, and multiplexing.
 Network terminator 2 (NT2) is placed between an NT1 device and any adapters
 or terminal equipment. Many devices provide the NT1 and NT2 devices in the
 same physical hardware. Larger installations generally separate these devices. An

 A 396 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 example of an NT2 device is a digital private branch exchange (PBX) or ISDN
 router. An NT2 device provides an S interface and accepts a T interface from an
 NT1. NT2 usually handles data link and network layer functions, such as contention
 monitoring and routing, in networks with multiple devices.
 Terminal equipment 1 (TE1) is a local device that speaks via an S interface. It
 can be directly connected to the NT1 or NT2 devices. An ISDN telephone and an
 ISDN fax are good examples of TE1 devices.
 Terminal equipment 2 (TE2) devices are common, everyday devices that can be
 used for ISDN connectivity. Any telecommunications device that is not in the TE1
 category is classified as a TE2 device. A terminal adapter is used to connect these
 devices to an ISDN and attaches through an R interface. Examples of TE2 devices
 include standard fax machines, PCs, and regular telephones.
 A terminal adapter (TA) connects TE2 devices to an ISDN. A TA connects
 through the R interface to the TE2 device and through the S interface to the ISDN.
 The peripheral required for personal computers often includes an NT1 device, better
 known as ISDN modems.

 ISDN modems are used in PCs to connect them to an ISDN network.The term
 modem is used incorrectly here. ISDN passes data in a digital format, so there
 is no need to convert the digital data from the computer the way a traditional
 modem converts the digital data to analog so that it can travel. Conventional
 modems convert analog to digital and vice versa.



 identifiers
 Standard telephone lines use a ten-digit identifier, better known as a telephone
 number, which is permanently assigned. ISDN uses similar types of identifiers,
 but they are not as easily used as a telephone number. ISDN uses five separate
 identifiers to make a connection. When the connection is first set up, the provider
 assigns two of these: the service profile identifier (SPID) and the directory number
 (DN). These are the most common numbers used because the other three are
 dynamically set up each time a connection is made. The three dynamic identifiers
 are the terminal endpoint identifier (TEI), the service address point identifier
 (SAPI), and the bearer code (BC).
 The directory number (DN) is the ten-digit phone number the telephone company
 assigns to any analog line. ISDN services enable a greater degree of flexibility in Remote Connectivity Concepts 397


using this number than analog services do. Unlike an analog line, where a one-to-
one relationship exists, the DN is only a logical mapping. A single DN can be used
for multiple channels or devices. In addition, up to eight DNs can be assigned to one
device. Because a single BRI can have up to eight devices, it can support up to 64
directory numbers. This is how offices are able to have multiple numbers assigned to
them. Most standard BRI installations include only two directory numbers, one for
each B channel.
 The service profile identifier (SPID) is the most important number needed when
you are using ISDN. The provider statically assigns the SPID when the ISDN
service is set up. It usually includes the DN plus a few extra digits. The SPID usually
contains between 10 and 14 characters and varies from region to region. SPIDs can
be assigned for every ISDN device, for the entire line or for each B channel.
 The SPID is unique throughout the entire switch and must be set up correctly.
If it is incorrect, the result is like dialing the wrong phone number—you will not
be able to contact the person you are trying to reach. When an ISDN device is
connected to the network, it sends the SPID to the switch. If the SPID is correct,
the switch uses the stored information about your service profile to set up the
data link. The ISDN device will not send the SPID again unless the device is
disconnected from the network.
 A terminal endpoint identifier (TEI) identifies the particular ISDN device to the
switch. This identifier changes each time a device is connected to the ISDN. Unlike
the SPID or the DN, the TEI is dynamically allocated by the central switch.
 The service address point identifier (SAPI) identifies the particular interface on the
switch to which your devices are connected. This identifier is used by the switch and
is also dynamically updated each time a device connects to the network.
 The bearer code (BC) is an identifier made up of the combination of TEI and
SAPI. It is used as the call reference and is dynamic, like the two identifiers included
within it. It changes each time a connection is established.

advantages of isDn
ISDN offers several major advantages over conventional analog methods. First,
it has a speed advantage over normal dial-up lines. Normal dial-up lines use a
modem to convert the digital signals from a PC into analog. This enables data to
be transferred over public phone lines. This technology does, however, have speed
limitations. The fastest standard modem connection that is currently available is
56 Kbps. Given that this is an analog connection, many modems cannot reach 398 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 this speed, because they are limited by the quality of the connection. This fact
 accounts for your connecting at different speeds each time you dial in to a remote
 network. Because phone lines cannot actually transmit at 56 Kbps, a special kind
 of compression is used to enable these speeds. Two standards are used currently. In
 order to satisfy all users, ISPs must support both standards, which quickly becomes
 expensive.
 ISDN enables you to use multiple digital channels at the same time to pass data
 through regular phone lines. The connection made from your computer, however,
 is completely digital; it is not converted to analog. You can use other protocols that
 enable you to bind channels together to get a higher bandwidth rate. In addition,
 ISDN makes a connection in half the time of an analog line.
 In addition to speed, ISDN supports multiple devices set up in one link. In an
 analog system, a single line is required for each device that is attached. For example,
 a separate phone line is needed for a normal phone, a fax machine, or a computer
 modem. Since ISDN supports multiple devices, you can use each one of these items
 on a single line. The connection will also be clearer because the data is being passed
 in digital format.
 Because ISDN uses a separate channel—the D channel for signaling information—
 it removes the administrative overhead from the B channel so that it can focus on
 carrying just the data signals. This means that the data is not hindered by the session
 setups and the signaling information that maintains the session that is required by the
 devices for communication. The D channel keeps all this information off the data
 streams (also known as “out of band signaling”). Because of this separation, the setup
 and takedown of each session is much faster. In addition, ISDN equipment is able to
 handle calls more efficiently.

remote access service (ras)
 RAS has become a major part of network solutions, using the telephone lines as the
 physical medium to transfer the data. RAS is a service that allows remote clients to
 connect to the server over a modem using a RAS-based protocol such as the Serial
 Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or the newer Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). Remote Access Service (RAS) 399


 PPP can run with network protocols such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and NetBEUI;
 SLIP only supports TCP/IP. This means that you will need to ensure that the client
 has the network protocol of the destination installed and that the RAS protocol
 (SLIP or PPP) can run with that network protocol. For example, if the remote
 network is running IPX/SPX, you will need to ensure that the user who wishes to
 dial up to that network is running IPX/SPX and that the RAS protocol supports
 IPX/SPX (PPP in this case).
 SLIP and PPP are two communications protocols used by RAS that are used to
 connect a computer to a remote network through a serial connection using a device
 such as a modem. When the computer dials up to the remote network, it is treated as
 an actual node on the network like any other networking device. This setup enables
 users to run network applications from home as though they were on the network.
 SLIP and PPP are fairly similar protocols as far as the overall goal, but they
 differ in their implementation. They use some of the same underlying technologies,
 but PPP is newer and better suited for today’s expanding networks. The following
 sections discuss each protocol—how it works, and some of its advantages.


serial Line internet Protocol (sLiP)
 The Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is a communications protocol used for
 making a TCP/IP connection over a serial interface to a remote network. SLIP was
 designed for connecting to remote UNIX servers across a standard phone line. This
 protocol was one of the first of its kind, enabling a remote network connection to be
 established over a standard phone line.
 SLIP was designed when TCP/IP was the only network protocol commonly used by
 all UNIX platforms. Although it is still in use today, SLIP has mostly been replaced
 by PPP. A user can be configured as a SLIP client with Windows 2000/XP/2003, but
 Windows cannot be a SLIP dial-in server.

 using sLiP to Connect to a remote Host
 To set up a SLIP client in Windows, you must first create the new connection within
 your Network Connections dialog box. Once you have created the dial-up network
 connection, you will need to configure its properties and change it from using PPP
 (the default in Windows) to using the SLIP protocol. Figure 8-2 shows an example
 of the properties available for configuring a SLIP connection. 400 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity




 figure 8-2

 You might notice that the Settings button is grayed out once you switch from
 PPP to SLIP; this is because SLIP provides no support for advanced features such
 as software compression, password encryption, or multilink functionality. Select
 Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click Properties to configure parameters such as the
 IP address, DNS server addresses, default gateway, and IP header compression.
 SLIP is a very simple serial-based protocol. It does not provide the complexity
 that others, such as PPP, do. Although that can be an advantage, SLIP unfortunately
 does not include the feature set of other protocols. For example, it does not support
 option negotiation or error detection during the session setup. It cannot be assigned
 an address from a DHCP server—it must use static addresses. It also cannot negotiate
 the authentication method. Issues such as these have helped define the new protocols
 that are emerging because a given functionality does not exist in SLIP.
 The following list summarizes the characteristics of SLIP:

 n Runs only with TCP/IP.
 n Does not support DHCP functionality.
 n Does not support compression or password encryption.
 n Used to connect to older UNIX or Linux SLIP servers. Remote Access Service (RAS) 401


Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is the default RAS protocol in Windows and is
 a data link–layer protocol used to encapsulate higher network-layer protocols to
 pass over synchronous and asynchronous communication lines. PPP was originally
 designed as an encapsulation protocol for transporting multiple network layer
 traffic over point-to-point links. PPP also established other standards, including
 asynchronous and bit-oriented synchronous encapsulation, network protocol
 multiplexing, session negotiation, and data-compression negotiation. PPP also
 supports protocols other than TCP/IP, such as IPX/SPX and DECnet.
 For PPP to transmit data over a serial point-to-point link, it uses three
 components. Each component has its own separate function but requires the
 use of the other two to complete its tasks. The following list explains the three
 components and their purposes:

 n PPP uses the High-Level Data-Link Control (HDLC) protocol as the basis to
 encapsulate its data during transmission.
 n PPP uses the Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, test, and configure the
 data link connection.
 n Various network control protocols (NCPs) are used to configure the different
 communications protocols. This system enables the use of different protocols,
 such as TCP/IP and IPX, over the same line simultaneously.

 network Control Protocols
 Although multiple network protocols are available, Microsoft products use three
 main protocols for PPP. Each NCP is specific to a particular network-layer protocol
 such as IP or IPX/SPX. The following is a list of network control protocols.

 n The Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is used to configure, enable, and
 disable the IP protocol modules at each end of the link.
 n The Internet Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP) is used to enable,
 configure, and disable IPX protocol modules at each end of the link.
 Although multiple versions of this NCP are available, IPXCP is the most
 common and is overtaking the other IPX NCPs in popularity.
 n The NetBIOS Frames Control Protocol (NBFCP) is used to enable, configure,
 and disable NetBEUI protocol modules at each end of the link. 402 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 How PPP Works
 PPP uses these three components together to enable it to communicate. It starts by
 sending LCP frames to test and configure the data link. Next, the authentication
 protocols are negotiated. Although numerous authentication protocols are available,
 the most common are the Challenge Handshaking Authentication Protocol
 (CHAP) and the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP). They determine the
 type of validation performed for security. The client then sends NCP frames to
 configure and set up the network-layer protocols to be used during this session.
 When this step is complete, each network protocol can pass data through this
 connection. HDLC is used to encapsulate the data stream as it passes through the
 PPP connection. The link remains active until an LCP or NCP frame closes the link
 or until an error or external event, such as a user disconnecting the link, occurs.
 A control mechanism is included in PPP to enable each protocol to communicate
 with the others. Finite-state automation (FSA) processes status messages between
 each layer to coordinate communications. FSA does not actually participate in data
 flows; it works with the other protocols to keep them in sync and enables them to
 concentrate on their own jobs.

 PPP framing
 PPP framing defines the format in which data is encapsulated before it crosses the
 network. PPP offers a standard framing solution that enables connections to any
 standard PPP server because all vendors use the same format. PPP uses HDLC as
 the basis for its encapsulation framing for serial connections. HDLC is widely used
 in other implementations and has been slightly modified for use with PPP. The
 modifications were made to facilitate multiplexing NCP layers.

 PPP Devices
 PPP is capable of operating across any data terminal equipment or data circuit
 terminating equipment (DTE/DCE) device. Many examples of these devices are
 available, including the most common, those following the EIA/TIA-232 standard,
 better known as modems. PPP is able to use any DTE/DCE devices as long as they
 support full-duplex circuits. These can be dedicated or switched and can operate
 in an asynchronous or synchronous bit-serial mode. In addition, the limit on
 transmission rates is specified by the interfaces and is not controlled by PPP.
 You should remember that the DTE is the terminal or PC used to communicate
 with other systems, and the DCE is the modem that actually does the communicating. Remote Access Service (RAS) 403


authentication Protocols
With PPP, each system could be required to authenticate itself. This can be done
using an authentication protocol. The most common authentication protocols
are PAP, CHAP, and the Microsoft adaptation of CHAP, MS-CHAP. When a
connection is being established, either end node can require the other to authenticate
itself, whether it is the remote host or the originator of the call. The LCP can be
used to send information to the other node to specify the authentication type. Using
the authentication protocols, you enable the capability to offer a level of security by
requiring authentication to make a remote connection; you also have control over
the level of security used.
 PAP works much like a regular network login. The client authenticates itself to
a server by passing the username and password to it. The server then compares this
information to its password store. Because the password is passed in clear text, this
system would not work well in an environment in which security concerns are an
issue. The system opens the door for anyone “listening” to the line, such as with a
network sniffer.
 Alternatively, CHAP uses an encryption algorithm to pass the authentication
data to protect it from hackers. The server sends the client a randomly generated
challenge request with its hostname. The client then uses the hostname to look
up the appropriate secret password and returns a response using a one-way hash
with the client’s hostname. The host now compares the result and acknowledges
the client if it matches. CHAP also sends challenges at regular intervals to verify
that the correct client is still using this connection. The challenge values change
during each interval. Because CHAP is so much more secure than PAP, it is used
widely on the Internet. PAP is usually used only in public FTP sites or other
public areas.
 MS-CHAP is a Microsoft adaptation of CHAP. It uses the same type of
encryption methodology but is slightly more secure. The server sends a challenge
to the originating host, which must return the username and an MD-4 hash of the
challenge string, the session ID, and the MD-4 hashed password. This system enables
the authenticator to store the passwords in an encrypted format instead of plain
text. Figure 8-3 shows the authentication protocol selections when using PPP as the
dial-in protocol for Windows XP. To obtain a list of the supported protocols, go to
your dial-in connection properties and select the Security tab. Once on the Security
tab, you can select the Advanced security option and then click Settings to view the
authentication protocols. 404 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity

 troubleshooting PPP
 When you use PPP to connect to a remote network, you may encounter problems.
 These problems can range from no dial tone to a modem misconfiguration or
 connectivity problems with the remote PPP server. A log is included with your
 communication device to enable you to monitor the steps in opening a PPP
 connection and to troubleshoot where the breakdown might have occurred. To
 enable modem logging in Windows, go to the properties of the modem device in
 Device Manager and click the Diagnostics tab. On the Diagnostics tab choose the
 Append To Log option as shown in Figure 8-4.

 Windows directory by default. It can be viewed using any standard text editor and is
 appended each time a new connection is attempted.
 Figure 8-5 shows the beginning of a PPP connection to a remote network. It

 how to read these log files enables you to troubleshoot almost any PPP problem that

 advantages of PPP over sLiP
 PPP offers several advantages over SLIP. First, PPP offers multinetwork protocol
 support, meaning that it can run with IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and AppleTalk
 while SLIP can be used only with TCP/IP. Any of these protocols can be used, which
 enables you to connect to multiple types of systems on the remote network through
 dial-up. The addition of NCPs allows for this
 functionality in PPP.
 In addition, PPP offers the capability to use
 DHCP. The addition of LCP made options

Dial-up networking
 Remote connectivity has had a huge impact on the world market. Many businesses
 everywhere use remote connectivity to interconnect sites to a single network.
 It is also used to connect users to the public Internet and to private corporate
 networks. The New Connection Wizard in Windows allows you to connect to
 a wealth of different remote servers or to act as a server, depending on how you
 answer the questions in the wizard. The New Connection Wizard has replaced the
 dial-up networking feature in previous versions of Windows such as Windows 9x
 and ME. Figure 8-6 shows the various connections that can be built with the New
 Connection Wizard in current versions of Windows. Dial-Up Networking 407

 allow only one concurrent incoming connection.



Modem Configuration Parameters
 Modems are data communication devices that are used to pass data through
 the PSTN from node to node. A modem—the word combines modulator with
 demodulator —is used to convert a digital signal to an analog format to transmit 408 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 across the network. It reverses the conversion process on the other end node to
 receive the data. Typically, the EIA/TIA-232 serial standard is used to connect the
 modem to a computer.
 Modem communication can be of several types: asynchronous, synchronous, or
 both. In asynchronous communication, all data is sent separately, relying on the
 node on the other end to translate the bit order. Synchronous communication sends
 all data in a steady stream and uses a clock signal to interpret the beginning and end
 of a packet. Most users today employ synchronous communication in the modems
 that they buy.
 Various system parameters must be set up properly to enable a modem to work.
 These parameters define the system resources for the modem device to use during
 its operations. Common parameters include serial ports and baud rates. Let’s look at
 these parameters in more detail.

 serial Port
 Serial communications send signals across a point-to-point link. Bits are
 transmitted one after another in a continuous data stream. Serial ports are the
 typical means for connecting modems to personal computers. They are based on
 9-pin (DB-9) and 25-pin (DB-25) connectors commonly known as COM1, COM2,
 COM3, and COM4. As we mentioned earlier in the chapter, the computer side of
 the connection is known as the data terminal equipment (DTE) and the modem is
 known as the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE). Various pins are used for
 different functions inside these connectors. Some are used for transmitting data,
 others for receiving data, and the remainder for control signals.
 You must specify the appropriate serial port settings when you set up a modem.
 Most modems attempt to use COM1 by default. Each COM port is assigned a
 specific set of address variables by default when you set up connections. To change
 the modem COM port after the setup is complete, select Start | Control Panel |
 Printers And Other Hardware | Phone And Modem Options. Highlight the
 appropriate modem on the Modem page and click Properties.

 Maximum Port speed
 The maximum port speed is defined by the kilobits per second that the modem can
 support. Maximum rates are defined primarily by the modem hardware; however, the
 current public telephone network has an upper limit of 56 Kbps through an analog
 modem. Port speeds are defined by the standards and features available to them. Dial-Up Networking 409


 Note that the terms baud and port speed are not identical. Port speeds define
 how fast data is traveling; baud measures the signal change per second. With
 encoding, 2 bits look like 1; therefore, the two terms will not match.

 Multiple modem standards exist to define the various features and bandwidths
 available. Various models provide different standards levels. Before you purchase any
 modem, you should verify that it fits your current needs and meets the appropriate
 standard. Table 8-1 illustrates the standards.
 To configure the port speed in Windows XP, select Start | Control Panel |
 Printers And Other Hardware | Phone And Modem Options. Select your modem
 from the Modems tab and click Properties. When the properties of the modem
 appear, click the Modem tab. Select the appropriate port speed from the Maximum
 Port Speed list, as shown in Figure 8-7.


unimodem
 With Windows operating systems, an additional subsystem is available to simplify
 dial-up networking. Unimodem provides an easy, centralized mechanism for
 installing and configuring modems, as shown in Figure 8-8. In installing the modem,
 the wizard enables you to specify configurations included with Windows or to obtain
 the configuration from disk. Windows ships with over 600 modem configurations
 included. The information obtained by this process is then accessible to any other
 application. Many applications written today that run on Windows specifically
 request information from this process if a modem is required.

telephony aPi
 The Microsoft Telephony API (TAPI) is an application interface used for accessing
 communications features such as connection monitoring. This API is used to
 provide services such as these without relying on the hardware to set them up. It ties
 in heavily to the Unimodem mechanism. TAPI functions completely independently
 from the device hardware. It is now used for modem data transfers; the COMM.API
 is used for these operations.
 When modems were first becoming popular, they could be difficult to configure.
 You had to understand the settings to use, such as which COM port to set up; the
 system resources, such as IRQs and DMA channels; and modem baud rates. Each
 application that was to use this device had to be set up separately. This process
 could take a great deal of time and become complex quickly when you attempted
 to use advanced modem initialization strings. TAPI replaced this requirement by
 providing a standard interface with which the modem would communicate so that
 the interface could be set up once and all applications could use it.
 TAPI also provides other features, such as multiple calling locations. You
 can set up connection profiles for different dial-up access numbers. You can
 also customize how the number is dialed. For example, suppose that you set up
 two separate connection profiles, one with call waiting enabled and the second
 without it. This setup enables you to manage multiple connections without having
 to reconfigure your modem setup every time you need a variation.
 To access the TAPI options, select Start | Control Panel | Printers And Other
 Hardware | Phone And Modem Options. Figure 8-9 displays some of the options
 available for customization.


requirements for a remote Connection
 Over the course of this chapter, we have addressed several types of remote
 connectivity technologies. Each has its strengths and weaknesses along with its core
 functions. Some technologies provide features or functionality that you might not
 need or want. Understanding how each one works and its benefits and disadvantages
 enables you to recommend solutions to fit business needs. It is now time to pull
 all the information together to figure out what is required to make your remote
 connection work. 412 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity

 To provide access to a remote server or network, you must properly set up and
 configure several items. Each item depends on other items, and this connection will
 not work without them all. The following list contains the common components
 required to connect to remote resources.

 n Dial-up networking client This client must be set up with the appropriate
 parameters defined.
 n Remote server You must have a remote server to dial in to reach a remote
 network.
 n User account (PPP, SLIP, RAS) You must have a valid ID and password
 on the remote server or network.
 n Modem/ISDN You must have a hardware device that enables you to
 communicate with the remote host.
 n Access protocol A network-layer protocol must be set up and configured
 properly to access resources on the remote server or network. Examples
 include TCP/IP, IPX, and NetBEUI. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) 413



CertifiCation objeCtive 8.04


virtual Private networks (vPns)
 This chapter has so far discussed how to connect to a remote network using RAS,
 which typically involves a connection across the PSTN from one system to another.
 RAS is a great solution to remotely connect to a system, but it does mean that we
 are incurring long-distance phone calls. The solution to cut down on long-distance
 calls was to use the Internet as the physical connection. In order to use the public
 Internet as a physical medium to carry data between a client and the remote
 network, you first want to create an encrypted tunnel between you and the remote
 network; then the data is delivered in the encrypted tunnel. This will ensure that
 no one can intercept the data and read it, because it is transmitted in an encrypted
 format—the purpose of the VPN.


vPn overview
 Once the Internet became popular, it was an obvious solution to allow users in
 remote locations to communicate with networks over distance. For example, if
 we had an office in New York and a user in a hotel room in Boston who wanted
 to access the network in New York, what better solution than to use the Internet!
 The problem, of course, is the security issues that surround sending data across the
 Internet for the entire world to tap into!
 Virtual private networks (VPNs) offer a solution. The idea of a VPN is that the user
 in Boston that is in the hotel will dial up to the Internet using the ISP in Boston
 provided by the hotel. Once the user in the hotel has the Internet connection, he or
 she will then dial the IP address of the VPN server in New York to create a “secure
 tunnel” between the client system and the VPN server in New York. Any data that
 travels between the two systems will be encrypted
 and therefore will be considered secure.
 Two of the major benefits of VPN are secured

 add security to it. 414 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 Just as there are two primary RAS protocols (SLIP and PPP), there are two
 primary VPN protocols that provide this tunneling security; they are the Point-to-
 Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP).


vPn Protocols
 The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a network protocol that provides
 for the secure transfer of data from a remote client to a private server by creating a
 multiprotocol virtual private network, or VPN. PPTP is used in TCP/IP networks
 as an alternative to conventional dial-up networking methods. This system
 enables multiprotocol secure communication over a public TCP/IP network such
 as the Internet. PPTP takes advantage of an additional level of security that is not
 currently available in other standard implementations.
 PPTP is actually an extension of PPP. It encapsulates PPP packets into IP datagrams
 for transmission across a network. This system enables the functionality of PPP while
 taking advantage of the security features offered by the VPN technology. Using both
 options tied into one protocol, you get the best of both worlds.

 a brief History of PPtP
 PPTP became recognized by the IETF (a standards committee) in June 1996.
 Although many tunneling protocols have been created and implemented, this
 was the first standard tunneling protocol to become available. Many vendors have
 adopted it in an attempt to provide a secure method to connect across the public
 Internet into a corporate internal network.

 How PPtP Works
 VPNs are used to provide tunneling through a public network with a secure
 communications channel. Users can employ PPTP to dial into a public network,
 such as PSTN, to use the Internet to connect to their corporate offices. This system
 enables users to use the network infrastructure that is already in place; it eliminates
 the need for dedicated modem banks for users.
 PPTP tunneling can be defined as the process of routing packets through an
 intermediate public network to reach a private network. Only the PPTP-enabled
 client can access the remote network; other clients on the same segment cannot.
 The interesting thing about this process is that you can dial into a standard PPP
 server and use it to establish a PPTP connection to the remote network. No Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) 415


 additional setup or option choices are required of your ISP; most offer PPP access
 already. You could also set up a PPTP server to dial into; this setup would enable you
 to only require PPP to be set up on the clients.
 Once the PPTP server receives the packet from the client connection, it routes
 the data to the appropriate resource. This occurs by stripping off the PPTP and PPP
 overhead to obtain the addressing information originally applied to it. The PPTP
 server must be configured with TCP/IP to communicate with PPTP and whatever
 other protocols are being passed through this VPN tunnel.
 A VPN works by encapsulating the data within IP packets to transport it through
 PPP. This enables the data to pass through the Internet and use the standards already
 in place. No configuration changes are required to your existing network stacks; they
 can be used as-is over the PPTP connection. Other protocols, such as NetBEUI and
 IPX, can also pass through this secure connection.
 VPNs are virtual devices set up as though they were regular devices such as
 modems. In addition, PPTP must be set up on the client and the server. Host
 computers in the route between these two computers do not need to be PPTP
 aware, since the packet’s IP header is not encrypted. They need only provide an
 IP route to the remote server. Figure 8-10 shows the layout of a VPN solution.

 This may require the client to dial up to the local ISP first, or it may already

 2. The VPN client dials the IP address or FQDN of the VPN server. When
 authenticated, a secure tunnel is created by the VPN protocol such as PPTP
 or L2TP. All traffic between the VPN client and VPN server is encrypted. 416 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 PPTP mainly involves three processes to set up a secure communications channel.
 Each process must be completed before beginning the next process. The following
 list identifies the processes involved:

 n PPP connection and communication PPTP uses PPP to connect to a
 remote network. When connected, PPP is also used to encrypt the data
 packets being passed between the remote host and the local machine.
 n PPTP control connection When the PPP session is established, PPTP
 creates a control connection between the client and the remote PPTP server.
 This process is referred to as tunneling.
 n PPTP data tunneling PPTP creates the IP datagrams for PPP to send. PPP
 encrypts the data portion of packets, which are sent through the tunnel to
 the PPTP server. The PPTP server is then used to decrypt the PPP-encrypted
 packets, disassemble the IP datagram, and route to the appropriate host.

 PPTP relies heavily on PPP to perform
 its job. PPP is used to enable multiple
 network-layer protocols to be used within the

 encrypting data packets.


 setting up PPtP
 There are three main components to setting up a PPTP connection:

 n PPTP client This is a client system that connects to the PPTP server by IP
 address or fully qualified domain name.
 n PPTP server This is the VPN server that allows for PPTP connections.
 n Network access server (NAS) This is the server that connects you to
 the network that you will use to call the PPTP server. Typically, this is the
 Internet service provider (ISP) that is responsible for connecting you to the
 Internet. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) 417


 These various components are equally important and must be configured properly
 to enable a user to access resources on a remote network. Each component has its
 specified functions and requirements. Today, Windows systems can be used as a
 PPTP client, while Windows 2003 Server also supports PPTP server services through
 the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS).
 Also understand that in this day and age the VPN client will typically not need
 to dial up to the ISP to get an Internet connection before dialing into the VPN
 server. With the widespread use of high-speed Internet, today’s VPN client will most
 likely already have an Internet connection and therefore simply need to dial the IP
 address of the VPN server to make a VPN connection.
 Exercise 8-3 explains how to set up Windows XP as a PPTP client. The exercise
 demonstrates using Windows XP as a PPTP client dialing into a PPTP server.

terminal services
 One of the best features that has come from Microsoft servers during the past
 few years is Windows Terminal Services (WTS). Windows Terminal Services is a
 feature that allows clients to establish a remote session with the server and have the
 interface of the server appear on the client. The client can then run the software
 that is on the server and typically remotely administer the server this way.
 Terminal Services uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over a TCP/IP
 network to send screen refreshes from the server to the client. Its primary purpose
 is to allow fairly old computers to run up-to-date software by allowing the network
 administrator to install the software on the terminal server and have the clients
 create a session with the server. Within this session the clients would be able to run
 whatever software was installed on the server.
 Organizations often use this feature for specialized software that needs to be
 deployed to a selected group of individuals. Instead of the software being installed for
 that selected group of individuals, those individuals would create a terminal session
 with the server to run the special software.


advantages of terminal services
 There are two major benefits to Terminal Services:

 1. The capability to install software on one server.
 2. The capability to have that software available to all of the terminal clients
 instantly. If this software needs to be upgraded, the upgrade needs to be done
 only on the server; the terminal clients will be aware of the new upgrade
 immediately. 422 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 The other benefit of Terminal Services, which is the reason most people are
 using it, is that the server supports a remote administration mode that licenses two
 network administrators to connect to the server at any point in time for remote
 administration. This feature allows network administrators to lock the servers in the
 server room and remotely connect to the terminal server over any TCP/IP network
 (including the Internet) to do their administration. This means that when there
 are server problems at 9 p.m., you can terminal into the server from your home to
 solve the problem instead of taking the one-hour drive to the office to fix a small
 configuration problem.
 Another significant advantage to Terminal Services is that you can extend the
 lifetime of an old computer; older computers with limited RAM and processing
 power can be used to run new applications, because the software is actually run
 from the terminal server during a terminal session. You are not using memory or
 processing power on the client system to run the terminaled applications.


Disadvantages of terminal services
 The big drawback to Terminal Services is the amount of RAM and processing power
 the server needs to handle all the remote sessions that are running in its memory.
 This is one of the key reasons why most terminal servers are probably being used for
 just the remote administration feature, and are not being used to run the Microsoft
 Office suite at the desktops through remote sessions.
 If you intend to require selected clients to run an application from the terminal
 server, you will need to ensure that you have installed adequate amounts of memory
 and processing power on the server. It is recommended that you use multiple
 processors in the server to handle the processing requirements of a multisession
 environment.


remote Desktop
 Because most companies were using their Windows 2000 terminal servers for the
 purpose of remote administration, Microsoft decided to build the “terminal services

 sitting at the console will be locked out while you do your remote administration.
 In Windows 2003 Server you can have two users connected through Remote
 Desktop for the purpose of remote administration while the person sitting at the
 console is left logged in. This is great, because you can use Remote Desktop to
 access the server and not affect anyone doing administration at the console.
 To enable the Remote Desktop feature in Windows Server 2003, click Start
 and right-click My Computer; then choose Properties. Once the properties have
 displayed, click the Remote tab and you will see the Remote Desktop feature. If
 you select the option “Allow users to connect remotely to this computer,” you will
 enable the Remote Desktop feature (shown in Figure 8-11).
 Once you have enabled Remote Desktop, you can control who is allowed to
 use Remote Desktop to access your system by clicking the Select Remote Users
 button. By default, members of the administrators group are allowed to use Remote
 Desktop to access the server, but you can select additional user accounts in the
 dialog box shown in Figure 8-12.

 The concept behind remote connectivity is to provide access to a network from
 a remote location. Originally, the U.S. government used ARPANET to connect
 remote sites. From there, networks have drastically expanded in size during the past
 several decades. Many technologies have been spawned from the growing need for
 remote access.
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) are
 communications protocols used to communicate with remote networks through a
 serial device such as an analog modem. SLIP was originally designed to connect to
 remote UNIX boxes. SLIP supports only the TCP/IP network-layer protocol. It is
 rapidly being replaced by PPP.
 PPP is a more robust protocol than SLIP. PPP was designed to handle multiple
 network-layer protocols, such as TCP/IP, IPX, and NetBEUI. It includes additional
 features such as encapsulation, network protocol multiplexing, session negotiation,
 and data-compression negotiation. PPP uses three subprotocols: the High-Level
 Data-Link Control (HDLC), Network Control Protocol (NCP), and Link Control
 Protocol (LCP). HDLC handles data encapsulation, NCP handles network-layer
 protocols, and LCP handles connection maintenance and testing. PPP uses three
 different NCPs: IPCP for TCP/IP, IPXCP for IPX, and NBFCP for NetBEUI. PPP
 uses authentication protocols such as CHAP, PAP, and MS-CHAP. PPPLOG.TXT 426 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 is located in the Windows directory, which by default is C:Windows, and is used to
 troubleshoot PPP issues.
 The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) provides a secure communications
 channel through a public TCP/IP network such as the Internet. PPTP provides
 multiple network-layer protocol support using PPP as the underlying structure. PPTP
 uses a technology called virtual private networks (VPNs) to create the encrypted
 channel through which data is transmitted. You can use a PPTP client to connect to
 a standard PPP server and create a tunnel to another PPTP server across the network.
 You can also use a PPP client to connect to a PPTP server and enable it to handle
 the tunneling. VPN devices are created to facilitate PPTP connectivity following a
 three-step process: PPP connection and communication, PPTP control connection,
 and PPTP data tunneling.
 The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a system of digital telephone
 connections that enables data to be transmitted simultaneously end to end. ISDN
 developed as the standard telephone network progressed. ISDN uses channels to
 make up a logical circuit. Two types of channels are used: a B channel for data
 transfer and a D channel for circuit-control functions. Each B channel equals
 64 Kbps; each D channel represents either 16 Kbps or 64 Kbps. H channels are
 used to specify a number of B channels. A basic rate interface (BRI) consists of two
 B channels and one 16 Kbps D channel, totaling 144 Kbps. A primary rate interface
 (PRI) consists of 23 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel, totaling 1536 Kbps.
 ISDN device types define the type of hardware used and include NT1, NT2, TE1,
 TE2, and TA. Reference points are used to define logical interfaces. Identifiers
 label the connection and include the service profile identifier (SPID), the directory
 number (DN), the terminal endpoint identifier (TEI), the service address point
 identifier (SAPI), and the bearer code (BC).
 The public switched telephone network (PSTN) facilitates voice communications
 globally. Also known as plain old telephone system (POTS), the PSTN was the first
 telecommunications network of its size in existence. Wide area network technologies
 are all based to some degree on this network. Various analog device types, including
 external modems, internal modems, and modem banks, are available to enable data
 communications.
 Dial-up networking functionality is included with all Windows versions since
 Windows 95. It enables users to connect to their internal networks or the Internet
 from remote locations. Dial-Up Networking supports four line protocols: NetWare
 Connect or Netware Remote Networking (NRN), the Remote Access Service
 (RAS), SLIP, and PPP. Three methods exist to invoke a dial-up session: explicit, Certification Summary 427


implicit, or application invoked. Because modems are used to connect to remote
networks, you must know how to configure them. IRQs, I/O addresses, and serial
ports all must be configured properly. Modems have a maximum port speed defined
by the standards they meet. The Unimodem subsystem provides one interface for all
applications to tie into the modem. The Telephony API (TAPI) provides additional
features such as connection monitoring and multiple-location support. Specific
items are required to use Dial-Up Networking; you must have the appropriate
network protocol set up, a line protocol set up, a server to dial into, and a properly
set-up modem. 428 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity

 1. þ D. The National ISDN 1 (NI-1) standard was defined by the industry so that users would
 not have to know the type of switch to which they are connected in order to buy equipment
 and software compatible with it.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect because NI-1 is the term used for ISDN.
 2. þ C. PRI is intended for users with greater bandwidth requirements. It requires T1 carriers
 to facilitate communications. Normally, the channel structure contains 23 B channels plus one
 64 Kbps D channel, for a total of 1536 Kbps.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect numbers of B channels.

remote access service (ras)
 3. þ A. The Serial Line Internet Protocol, or SLIP, is a communications protocol used for
 making a TCP/IP connection over a serial interface to a remote network. SLIP was designed
 for connecting to remote UNIX servers across a standard phone line. This protocol was one of
 the first of its kind, enabling a remote network connection to be established over a standard
 phone line.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because IPX/SPX and NetBEUI cannot run over SLIP. PPP is
 incorrect because it is not a network protocol, but a RAS protocol that competes with SLIP.
 4. þ B. PPP established other standards, including asynchronous and bit-orientated synchronous
 encapsulation, network protocol multiplexing, session negotiation, and data-compression
 negotiation. PPP also supports protocols other than TCP/IP, such as IPX/SPX and DECnet.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because SLIP is limited to running on TCP/IP networks. IPX
 and NetBEUI are standard network protocols, not protocols for RAS.
 5. þ A and B. The following text explains the three components of PPP and their purpose: PPP
 uses the High-Level Data-Link Control (HDLC) protocol as the basis to encapsulate its data
 during transmission; PPP uses the Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, test, and configure
 the data link connection; various network control protocols (NCPs) are used to configure the
 different communications protocols. This enables you to use different protocols such as TCP/IP
 and IPX over the same line simultaneously.
 ý C and D are incorrect because they are not a part of the Point-to-Point Protocol.
 6. þ B. The Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is the NCP used to configure, enable,
 and disable the IP protocol modules at each end of the link.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because B is correct and neither of the others exists. 434 Chapter 8: Remote Connectivity



 7. þ A and C. With PPP, each system could be required to authenticate itself. This can be done
 using an authentication protocol. The most common authentication protocols include the
 Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
 (CHAP), and the Microsoft adaptation of CHAP, MS-CHAP.
 ý B and D are incorrect because domain authentication is used to validate a user, not the
 connection, and KPA does not exist.
 8. þ A. Windows XP allows you to create a VPN server or RAS server that allows one
 connection. You may create these servers through the New Connection Wizard.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect.

Dial-up networking
 9. þ C. When logging has been enabled, you can see the log file after the next attempt to
 connect to a PPP server. The log file, modemlog_modemname.txt, is stored in the Windows
 directory by default. It can be viewed by any standard text editor and is appended to each time a
 new connection is attempted.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because none of them is the name of the log file that modem
 logging appends logging information to.
10. þ D. The New Connection Wizard found in your network connections window allows you to
 create new connections that connect to a RAS or VPN server.
 ý A, B, and C are all incorrect because you do not create new connections that way.
11. þ C. TAPI also provides other features, such as multiple calling locations. You can set up
 different connection profiles for different dial-up access numbers. You can also customize how
 the number is dialed. For example, if you set up two separate connection profiles, one with
 call waiting enabled and the second without it, you can manage multiple connections without
 having to reconfigure your modem setup every time you need a variation.
 ý A is incorrect because Unimodem is a part of Windows that allows for a single installation
 and configuration of a modem. B is incorrect because COMM is not a valid choice, since it is
 not a common program name with Windows; it is a driver name. D is incorrect because there is
 a correct answer choice.

13. þ A and C. VPNs establish tunnels by using VPN protocols such as PPTP and L2TP.
 ý B and D are incorrect because they are RAS protocols, not VPN protocols.
14. þ B. When the PPP session is established, PPTP creates a control connection between the
 client and the remote PPTP server. This process is referred to as tunneling.
 ý A is incorrect because PPTP uses PPP to connect to a remote network. When connected,
 PPP is also used to encrypt the data packets being passed between the remote host and the local
 machine. C is incorrect because PPTP creates the IP datagrams for PPP to send. The packets
 are encrypted by PPP and sent through the tunnel to the PPTP server. The PPTP server is
 then used to decrypt the PPP-encrypted packets, disassemble the IP datagram, and route to the
 appropriate host. D is incorrect because the transfer of data is not started until the tunnel has
 been established.

terminal services
15. þ A. Terminal Services use RDP to send screen updates from the server back to the client.

 requires less training for users, who can continue to use their existing OS. Administrators are
 also able to watch user sessions and determine what users are doing as well as to help users who
 are unable to perform some functions.
 ý B is incorrect because a higher-performance server being required is a disadvantage.

 W ith companies becoming larger and more geographically diverse, wide area
 networks (WANs) have become increasingly the norm for networks these days.
 Connecting two different LANs found at different locations within a company is
 a typical scenario for a WAN environment. For example, Company ABC may have two locations;
 one is New York and the other in Boston. The company wants the two locations to be able to
 communicate with one another without using the Internet.You, as the network administrator, will
 need to choose a WAN technology that connects these two LANs together, basing your decision
 on the performance and the cost of the technology.

 This chapter identifies some of the popular technologies that are used in WAN
 environments—be sure to be familiar with them for the Network+ exam. Also note
 that organizations may connect their different offices together using RAS or ISDN
 technologies as discussed in Chapter 8—be sure to review those for the exam as well.

Packet-switching vs. Circuit-switching networks
 This section introduces the concepts of packet-switching networking and circuit-
 switching networking technologies. Be sure to know these two terms for the
 Network+ exam.


Packet switching
 Packet switching is used by the Internet and routed networks. The path that is used
 to send data packets from one point to another through routers is not predetermined,
 meaning that each packet can take a different pathway to the destination. Packet-
 switched networks are efficient in that they consume bandwidth only when there is
 something to send. If you look at the routed network in Figure 9-1, you can see that
 from point A to point B there exist many paths for packets to travel. Packet-Switching vs. Circuit-Switching Networks 439


figure 9-1 A routed network




 When a user at PC A wants to copy a shared file from PC B, the data path is
 not a set path between specific routers. Packets are sent from router to router by
 the quickest or shortest path. If a router is extremely busy, it will not be used, and
 a different path will be chosen if one exists. Remember that other users are also
 sending data packets over the same media and routers.
 Referring to Figure 9-1, let’s now look at an example of how packet switching
 works. PC B sends its data to the router that is the least busy. For the first data
 packet, let us assume that it is Router 6. Now that Router 6 has the data packet, it
 looks at its routing table and determines that Router 3 might be the best way for it
 to reach PC A. Router 6 sends the data packet to Router 3, which in turn decides
 that the best path is to forward the packet on to Router 1. Router 1 then sends
 the packet to PC A. Now, the second packet might be sent to Router 7, because
 Router 6 has suddenly become very busy. Router 7 receives the data packet and
 forwards it to Router 4. Router 4 sends the packet to Router 2. Router 2 checks its
 routing table and sends the packet on to PC A. PC A then starts assembling the
 entire data file from the packets received. For the third data packet, let’s say that it
 is also sent to Router 7, which sends it to Router 5 again. Now let’s say that Router
 2 has suddenly gone offline. Router 5 waits to contact Router 2, but eventually it is
 timed out and sends the data packet back to Router 7, which then tries to send the 440 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies



 data packet to Router 4. Router 4 has since determined that Router 2 is offline and
 sends the data packet to Router 1. Router 1 sends the data packet to PC A. The
 fourth data packet is sent to Router 6, on to Router 3, then to Router 1, and finally
 is delivered to PC A.
 Let’s look more closely at packets 3 and 4: While packet 3 was detained at Router
 5 because of the failure of Router 2, packet 4 was able to be delivered to PC A before
 the arrival of packet 3. This shows that a packet-switched network does not depend
 on packets being delivered in the order in which they were sent. Actually, if there are
 enough data paths, it is very common for packets to be received out of order. With
 routable protocols, data packets are numbered so they can be placed back in the proper
 order to create the original block of data that existed at the sending PC. It would be
 counterproductive to receive a jumbled database or an unreadable document.
 Data packets are sent out of order on the
 Internet constantly. The only time this presents
 a problem is when the data being sent is
 streaming voice or video. If you have ever tried
 Packet switching is the to use the Internet as a medium for making

 network.The packets can be received There are a number of packet-switched
 out of order and are assembled at the network technologies; a few examples of WAN
 destination. technologies that employ packet-switched
 networks are Asynchronous Transfer Mode
 (ATM) and Frame Relay.


Circuit switching
 Circuit switching, on the other hand, is the foundation for the telephone system,
 but it is also widely used for data communications. When you make a telephone call
 from your home to someone next door or even 1000 miles away, a circuit is opened
 between your telephone and the telephone to which you are calling. The circuit is
 a dedicated pathway used by the communication and is not usable by others, so it is
 100 percent dedicated for your use. As you speak, your voice is sent over the media
 to the other telephone and is not broken up or rerouted. Generally speaking, circuit
 switching is less efficient than packet switching in that the bandwidth is consumed
 whether or not there is data to transmit; however, this allows service providers to
 offer customers a guaranteed bandwidth. Packet-Switching vs. Circuit-Switching Networks 441


 One of the major problems with circuit switching occurs when a circuit fails—the
 circuit is a permanent path, and there is no
 redirection of data through another path unless
 a new circuit is created. For example, if you
 are speaking with someone on the phone and
 Know the differences the line you’re using was brought down by a
 between packet-switching and circuit- fallen tree, your circuit will be broken and the
 switching networks. In addition, remember line will go dead. You will have to hang up and
 that data networks are usually packet- place the call again. When you place the call
 switched, whereas telephone connections again, a different circuit will be established and
 are normally circuit-switched. you will use that circuit for the duration of the
 communication.


exerCise 9-1

Packet-switching network exercise
 In this exercise, you are given a scenario and a network diagram to determine the
 path of a data packet.
 Your company has a headquarters and ten remote offices. All of the offices are
 connected by a packet-switching network to create a WAN. Look at Figure 9-2, and
 then answer the following questions.
 PC A is at the main headquarters, and PC B is at one of the remote offices. Each
 router in the diagram designates an office. You are sending data from PC A to PC
 B, and you want to try to determine the path the data will take on its route. Using a
 diagnostic utility, you determine that all of the even-numbered routers are extremely
 busy and are sending slow transmissions from the local LAN and remote LANs.

 1. What is the path that data packets could take from PC A to PC B?
 2. Is it possible that the data packets could arrive out of order?
 3. What are some reasons why Router 1 might be preferred over Router 3?
 4. What path would be used if the odd-numbered routers were offline or busy,
 and the even-numbered routers were online and not busy?
 5. What would occur if Routers 1, 2, and 3 were to become extremely busy or go
 offline? 442 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies



figure 9-2 A sample network used in the scenario of Exercise 9-1




 The answers are as follows:

 1. The route would be from PC A to the default gateway, then to either
 Router 1 or Router 3. The packet will then travel from Router 1 or 3 to
 Router 5, and from Router 5 to Router 7 or Router 9. Then the data packet
 will go from Router 7 or 9 to the default gateway for PC B, and then to PC B.
 2. Yes; since there are still multiple routes, one data path might be less busy
 than another at any given time. This could allow some data packets to arrive
 before others. For example, if Router 1 should suddenly become a little busier
 than Router 3, any packets sent to Router 3 might arrive before those sent to
 Router 1.
 3. Router 3 might be busier than Router 1, which will cause a packet to be
 delayed a little while. The routers might be configured to have a specific
 method to determine which route to use as a default or to make one more
 used than another. This could cause one router to be used until it is too
 busy, at which point another will be used. The specified method could be
 determined by hop counts or by some other configured means.
 4. From PC A the data packet would be passed to the default gateway, which
 would then be passed to Router 2. From Router 2, the data packet would be
 sent to either Router 4 or Router 6. Router 4 or Router 6 would send the Asynchronous Transfer Mode 443


 data packet to Router 8. Router 8 would send the data packets to the default
 gateway for PC B; at that point, the packet would be sent to PC B.
 5. No data could be sent from PC A to PC B, because there is no open path
 from PC A to PC B.




CertifiCation objeCtive 9.02


asynchronous transfer Mode
 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a circuit-switching technology that uses a
 consistent packet size of 53 bytes, called a cell. A 53-byte cell is broken into a 48-byte
 payload and a 5-byte header. The lack of overhead in the ATM packet (it is always
 53 bytes) helps promote the performance of this very fast LAN/WAN technology.
 ATM can be used to enhance broadband ISDN to allow for the transmission of
 voice, data, and multimedia packets over the same media simultaneously. Broadband
 media use frequencies to be able to manage many “circuits” over one cable. Digital
 transmissions are electrical or light pulses of on or off, depending on the physical
 medium over which it is transferred. Broadband is how cable TV works, with
 multiple channels on one cable using different frequencies for each channel.
 ATM will provide for high bandwidth as needed if enough users are requesting
 the bandwidth. ATM bandwidth ranges from slow speeds (around 12.96–25 Mbps
 using copper media such as category-3 UTP
 cable), to high speeds (around 622 Mbps using
 fiber-optic cable). With advances in technology,
 ATM speeds can reach 2.488 Gbps.
 ATM is a WAN technology ATM can be used with physical interfaces
 that allows for speeds of 622 Mbps or such as FDDI and SONET/SDH, which are
 more.This fast, reliable WAN technology discussed further on in this chapter. This means
 is great for sending voice or video across that in an FDDI or SONET/SDH network
 great distances. ATM can be used on the network topology
 for data transmissions. When setting up a
 switched network similar to that shown in
 Figure 9-1, ATM can allow for parallel transmissions between nodes. This means
 that if data is being passed to and from PC A and PC B, the data packets can be 444 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies



 passed between two routers (nodes) simultaneously. Remember that with ATM,
 data packets are referred to as cells, and each cell has a fixed length of 53 bytes.
 There are no variable-length cells as with some transmission standards. This allows
 all of the devices to be optimized for the specified cell size, thereby providing better
 performance. Once in place, an ATM network is transparent to users and provides
 for high data transmission speeds that can grow into a WAN when needed.
 ATM can be used in LAN environments,
 but its use is uncommon due to the high price

synchronous optical network/
synchronous Digital Hierarchy
 The Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) is a North American standard
 that allows the uniting of unlike transmissions into one single data stream. The
 Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is the European standard designed for the
 same purpose as SONET. Basically, SONET allows multiple companies to transmit
 the packets on their networks onto a SONET backbone to be transmitted to a
 remote location using fiber-optic cabling. Because many companies might be using
 different network topologies and protocols, the data streams from each company
 would most likely differ. These companies can transmit their information over
 SONET without having to conform to a network standard. For example, one
 company might have a 10 Mbps category-5 Ethernet network using IPX/SPX, Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 445


 while another is using fiber-optic cable with TCP/IP. These can be combined into
 a single data stream (this is called multiplexing) for transmission over one cable.
 More companies can be added for transmission over the SONET medium without
 making any changes to any of the company networks.
 This architecture allows for different media types and transmission types to
 be combined into one stream and sent over a fiber-optic cable. It is measured
 by optical carrier speed, which is the standard for fiber transmission. SONET
 runs at the lowest OC rate, which is a minimum speed of 54.84 Mbps, known as
 SONET-1.
 SONET is divided into electrical levels that have varying speeds, termed
 synchronous transport signals (STSs). The highest level is SONET-192, with a
 speed of 9953.280 Mbps. SDH has no equivalent for SONET-1 at the speed of
 51.84 Mbps, but has a low speed of 155.520 Mbps mapping to SONET-3. The
 different SDH levels are termed synchronous transfer modes (STMs). Table 9-1
 lists the various levels.
 The format for SONET is created by multiplexing all data signals into a
 single data stream called a synchronous transport signal (STS). The multiplexer
 is managed by the path-terminating equipment (PTE) from various media and
 transmission types, as shown in Figure 9-3. Now that the STS signal has been
 created, it must be transmitted on the SONET media. The STS transmission is
 managed by the line-terminating equipment (LTE), also shown in Figure 9-3.
 The LTE will send and receive the STS signal on both ends of the SONET media.
 Remember that the STS signal is in the form of electrical pulses. The SONET link
 might not be a single connection from one point to another, and entire segments
 might be composed of sections of SONET media. Therefore, to create the sections
 and have the entire segment appear as one physical link, section-terminating
 equipment (STE) is used to begin and end a section, as shown in Figure 9-3.

 There is also a scrambling device that allows transmissions to be scrambled.

 descramble the stream back into usable data.

optical Carrier Level-X
 The optical carrier (OC) standard is used to specify bandwidth for transmissions
 that are sent over fiber-optic cables. These standards are used to rate the SONET
 standards and will correlate to the bandwidths available for SONET/SDH.
 One OC channel (OC-1) is 51.84 Mbps, as is STS-1. When multiple channels
 are used, the bandwidth increases by 51.84 Mbps per channel. For example, nine X.25 and Frame Relay 447

x.25 and frame relay
 This section will introduce you to two popular packet-switched WAN technologies
 known as X.25 and Frame Relay. The two technologies have been around for many
 years, and you may be asked a question or two on the exam about them.


x.25
 X.25 is a packet-switched network that uses a device called a Packet Assembler/
 Dissembler (PAD) to connect a system to the X.25 network. The PAD is a device that
 connects to serial ports of a device and is therefore considered RS-232 compliant. 448 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies




 X.25 runs at layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI
 model and has transfer rates of 2 Mbps. Overall
 X.25 uses a PAD to this technology is fairly old and slow compared
 connect to the X.25 network. with some of today’s standards. Most X.25
 implementations communicate over analog lines.


frame relay
 Frame Relay is the digital version of X.25 and is much faster than X.25. Frame
 Relay runs at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model and supports transfer rates as high
 as 50 Mbps along with features such as Quality of Service (QoS). It is a choice for
 WAN networking along with ATM, Broadcast ISDN (BISDN), and Cell Relay.
 Frame Relay transmission speeds are not always constant. The data packets, or
 frames, are sent through a packet-switching network with higher-level protocols
 managing error checking, such as IPX/SPX or TCP/IP.
 Frame Relay is a highly efficient method of transmitting data using bandwidth
 at an optimal level, allowing for bandwidths well over X.25’s 2 Mbps. The nodes,
 which are used to route the frames in the packet-switching network, each use
 a routing algorithm that can help determine the efficiency of the Frame Relay
 network. Frame Relay does send frames as variable-length packets that are not all
 set at the same size before transmission.
 If the bandwidth becomes too congested, Frame Relay will drop any frames that
 it cannot handle. This can include corrupted frames, as well as those that are unable
 to be delivered because the destination cannot be reached. Any dropped frames must
 be requested for retransmission by the protocols being used. When the available
 bandwidth is at a minimum, the source or destination can be notified to slow the
 transmissions to avoid overutilization of the bandwidth, which will keep packets from
 being dropped due to congestion. Although the source or destination is requested to
 slow the transmissions, the transmissions do not necessarily have to be slow.
 To determine which packets are dropped, we must first be aware of who is
 transmitting over the Frame Relay network. Multiple companies can share a Frame
 Relay backbone to the Internet or between office buildings. Each company pays for
 a specific amount of the bandwidth on the Frame Relay medium. If the bandwidth
 is available, a company can use more bandwidth than that for which they have paid.
 Once other companies start using their bandwidth, all the companies will be limited
 to the bandwidth that has been committed to them. The bandwidth that each
 company pays for is noted by its Committed Information Rate (CIR). The CIR helps
 determine whether frames can be dropped when the bandwidth becomes congested. Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) 449


 The CIR is included in all frames sent by any company on the Frame Relay network.
 The Frame Relay nodes will keep statistics on network bandwidth and usage by all
 companies. If a company is using less bandwidth than what it paid for, its frames will
 be sent on through the node. If the company is using more bandwidth than the CIR
 designates, the frames are likely to be dropped.




 X.25 supports transfer (PAD), whereas Frame Relay supports
 rates of 2 Mbps and uses a serial device speeds as high as 50 Mbps and is a digital
 known as a Packet Assembler/Dissembler version of X.25.

fiber Distributed Data interface (fDDi)
 The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) topology is sometimes referred to as a
 fast, redundant Token Ring network. FDDI is similar to a Token Ring network in the
 sense that it uses token passing as the access method, but there are two rings instead
 of the one found in Token Ring. FDDI uses fiber-optic cable operating at 100 Mbps.
 If copper cable is used, such as category 5 at 100 Mbps, the topology is termed a
 Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI).
 Two rings are used in the FDDI architecture—the primary ring and the secondary
 ring. The primary ring is used at all times, and the secondary ring is used only if the
 primary ring fails. The token is passed on each ring in opposite directions.
 FDDI is specifically for WAN use, not for LAN use. FDDI is used to connect
 multiple sites. Even if the individual LANs are using non–Token Ring topologies,
 they can still be connected by FDDI. Each building or office would have either a
 dual-attachment concentrator (DAC) that allows both rings to be connected to the 450 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies



 DAC or two single-attachment concentrators (SAC). The SAC connects to a single
 ring, allowing the SAC to be powered down without affecting the ring.
 Now let’s examine the FDDI redundancy and find out why the two rings operate
 in opposite directions. If any ring should break or if an SAC should be shut down, as
 shown in Figure 9-4 part A, the network will still operate. Operation will continue
 because the broken section will be bypassed by using the secondary ring to allow
 the network to go back on itself and function as a continual ring. In Figure 9-4 part
 B, you can see that part of the ring is broken, so part of the secondary ring will be
 used to create a complete ring. The reason that the rings must operate in opposite
 directions is to continue passing the token from one ring to another without causing
 the direction to change. This allows for continuity if both rings are broken or if a
 DAC goes offline. If a DAC goes offline, then both rings are “broken.”

 Each DAC will have two sets of connectors—one set for both rings coming
 in and one set for both rings going out. Now consider an example of three office
 buildings set up with FDDI and how redundancy works to keep them online.
 Figure 9-5 shows the three DACs or SACs, depending on which they use. The
 three companies are all connected with dual rings.
 The grayed (inside) areas show the secondary
 ring, which is not in use. Now, assume that the
 fiber-optic cable is broken between Company B
 and Company C. Figure 9-6 shows what happens
 FDDI uses a fault-tolerant to the secondary ring when part of the primary
 ring topology and fiber-optic cabling that fails and how the ring is still complete, thereby
 reaches speeds of 100 Mbps. allowing the WAN to continue operating.
 Originally, the token is transferred from
 Company A to Company B, from Company B
 to Company C, and then from Company C to Company A. Once the token reaches
 Company A again, it continues the process. After the break and the redundancy
 feature starts, the token will go from Company A to Company B, then to Company
 A again and on to Company C, and back to Company A. Once at Company A,
 the process will continue until the break is fixed, and the token will be passed as it
 originally was before the cable break. Multiple cable breaks can take down the entire
 network or even cause multiple WANs to be created.

tx/ex-Carriers
 The T-carrier and E-carrier are both dedicated digital lines used to transmit voice,
 data, or images. The T-carrier is used in the United States, Japan, and Australia,
 whereas the E-carrier is used in Europe, Mexico, and South America. There
 are different categories of each carrier that indicate the speed of the line. T1 is
 composed of twenty-four channels that are made up of 64 Kbps bandwidth each,
 for a total of 1.544 Mbps. Each 64 Kbps channel is referred to as digital signal level
 0 (DS0), with the twenty-four DS0 channels making a digital signal level 1 (DS1).
 These lines can be multiplexed into faster links, as shown in Table 9-3.
 Most companies cannot afford a T-carrier line, so it is best for some companies to
 look into other means of connecting to the Internet or creating a WAN. If necessary,
 a company can lease a partial T1 line, which is called a Fractional T1, at a lower
 price. A Fractional T1 will also provide only a fraction of the bandwidth. Tx/Ex-Carriers 453

Csu/Dsu
 The Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU) is a device that allows
 a business to connect a high-speed data link from the telephone company to
 the business’s router for access to and from the LAN or WAN. The high-speed
 connections are usually T1 or T3 connections or their European counterparts,
 E1 and E3. The CSU/DSU used will be specific to the speed of the line being
 connected to from the telephone company.

 The CSU is the user end of the high-speed connection that will perform
 encoding and line conditioning as well as protect the LAN or WAN from electrical
 interference such as lightning. It can also provide statistics for line use. There is also
 the capability of a loopback test to assure that the high-speed data connection is
 still intact. The DSU portion is on the side of the telephone company and supports
 timing functions as well as data conversion.

internet access technologies
 There are a number of technologies that are used to connect to the Internet,
 including some of the high-speed Internet technologies that are used by small
 businesses or home users. These technologies include ADSL and Cable Modem
 Internet connections.


aDsL
 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a high-speed Internet service that
 allows the transfer of data over the phone lines. ADSL is provided by telecom
 providers and allows the ADSL subscriber to use the phone and the Internet
 simultaneously with download speeds as high as 9 Mbps and upload speeds around
 1 Mbps (hence asymmetric). The transfer rates differ for each service provider.
 An ADSL subscriber connects his or her PC to the larger telephone network by
 connecting to a central office (CO) that must be located within a 5 km distance of
 the subscriber. A special modem, known as an ADSL modem, is used to connect the
 ADSL user to a local CO. If there is not a CO close to a user’s location, that user
 would be unable to subscribe to the service.

 aDsL Hardware
 In order for the ADSL subscriber to connect to the local CO, a splitter will be
 connected to the phone jack in the wall. The splitter will then connect to the
 phone and also to the ADSL modem, as shown in Figure 9-7. This splitter is
 essentially a frequency filter. The human voice falls between 0 and 3.4 KHz, so the
 splitter sends transmissions below 3.4 KHz to the telephone, and transmissions above Internet Access Technologies 455


 figure 9-7 Splitter

 ADSL modem




 3.4 KHz are sent to and from the ADSL modem. The ADSL modem has an RJ-45
 jack that is used to connect to the network card in the PC. It is not really a modem
 in the sense of a modem that converts digital signals to analog signs; this modem is
 really just acting as a terminal adapter.




 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) uses an equivalent
 Subscriber Line (ADSL) uses different upload and download bandwidth; home
 download and upload speeds users typically use ADSL, but businesses
 (asymmetric), whereas Symmetric Digital most often use SDSL.


 Figure 9-8 displays an actual ADSL modem and splitter. The splitter, if needed,
 would connect to the phone jack in the wall, and then the computer would connect
 to the ADSL modem.

 A number of ADSL modems have the filter built into the modem, so the filter
 wall plate may not be needed. Also know that Very High Bitrate DSL (VDSL)
 is a new high-speed Internet technology that, for short distances, can offer a
 transfer rate of 52 Mbps and is deployed over copper lines.



Cable Modem
 If the phone companies are going to offer high-speed Internet service through the
 phone lines, you can bet that the cable companies would come up with a broadband,
 high-speed Internet solution using the coaxial cable TV lines. The cable companies
 connect you to the Internet over their lines by using a cable modem that connects
 to the workstation using TP cabling, but then the modem connects to the cable jack
 in the wall using coaxial cable (as shown in Figure 9-9).
 The cable provider supplies each channel on the cable in its own 6 MHz
 frequency range, and the signal for a particular channel is sent to you in that range.
 Cable companies supply the Internet data as its own channel, a 6 MHz frequency
 range being used to send data to your cable modem. Download speeds of cable
 modems have reached 10 Mbps but may differ with the different suppliers.
 One of the drawbacks of the cable modem is that you are sharing this bandwidth
 with your neighbors if they have subscribed to this Internet service as well. If you have
 a neighbor that constantly downloads large amounts of data, you may find that times
 are slow on the occasions when your neighbor uses the precious bandwidth. Keep in
 mind that the Internet provider can simply provide the data through an additional
 channel to keep up with neighborhood demands if the provider chooses to do so!
 There is an advantage to cable modems and that is that unlike ADSL, you do not
 need to be within close proximity of a CO. As long as you are receiving cable and
 your cable provider supplies Internet, you should be able to subscribe to high-speed
 Internet service. Figure 9-10 displays a cable modem.

High speed through satellite
 How can you get high-speed Internet service if you are in a rural area that does not
 have access to high speed through ADSL or cable modems? There is an option for
 getting high speed through the use of satellites, which provide download speeds as
 high as 500 Kbps. Although not as quick as ADSL or cable modems, satellite can
 provide service to areas that are typically unserviceable and is much faster than the
 conventional 56 Kbps modem.
 Satellite Internet uses a satellite dish that is about two feet high by three feet
 wide and uses two modems, one for downloads and one for uploads. The modems are
 typically connected to the satellite dish through coaxial cable.


other Methods of internet access
 There are a variety of other methods to connect the Internet if you don’t have
 access to an ADSL or cable modem connection. The following is a list of potential
 methods to connect to the Internet in addition to those mentioned previously:

 n POTS/PSTN The plain old telephone service/public switched telephone
 network provides access through conventional telephone lines using a
 modem to receive transfer rates as high as 56 Kbps.
 n Wireless A number of wireless providers now give mobile access to
 handheld devices. 458 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies




CertifiCation suMMary
 Networks have become such an important element in the business world that most
 businesses could not survive the loss of their network. Wide area networks (WANs)
 have evolved to allow the connection of multiple local area networks (LANs) that
 are not within close proximity. WANs allow the multiple LANs to operate as a
 single large network for growing companies.
 The different WAN technologies include Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM),
 which can also be used to create a LAN. ATM provides bandwidth on demand for
 users using an optical network. ATM can provide transfer rates as high as 622 Mbps.
 Another WAN technology is SONET/SDH, which uses optical carrier (OC)
 levels. These use fiber-optic cables to transfer data from different media. Data
 streams can be taken from different media and combined into one data stream,
 allowing for transmission speeds from 51.84 Mbps to 9953.28 Mbps. The non-
 SONET media are connected to a physical terminating equipment (PTE) device,
 which converts the electrical signals into optical signals. The optical signal is sent
 to the line-terminating equipment (LTE), which transmits the signal over different
 sections of fiber-optic cable. The many different sections of fiber-optic cable making
 up the SONET network are terminated by section-terminating equipment (STE).
 The OC levels are standards used to specify bandwidth over fiber-optic cable.
 Another WAN technology is Frame Relay. Frame Relay is a leased-line solution
 whereby a company can share the medium and the cost with other companies.
 The amount of bandwidth available to a company is determined by the amount of
 bandwidth for which it pays.
 FDDI is another WAN technology that is based on the Token Ring topology. It
 operates at 100 Mbps over fiber-optic or category-5 cables. A setup using category-5
 cables is known as a Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI). FDDI is composed
 of two rings operating in different directions. The second ring is used only if the first
 ring fails.
 Popular transmission methods are T-carriers and E-carriers. Each carrier is used in
 different countries with different bandwidths. The T- and E-carriers are completely
 digital and operate at speeds as high as 565.148 Mbps.
 High-speed Internet services can be provided through ADSL or cable modem.
 ADSL provides download speeds at approximately 9 Mbps and runs the voice and
 data services over the copper telephone wires at various frequencies. The cable
 companies provide high-speed Internet services with download speeds of about
 10 Mbps; they supply this data to your home using a different channel on the
 coaxial cable. Two-Minute Drill 459

Packet-Switching vs. Circuit-Switching networks
 1. þ B. Circuit switching is used by the telephone companies for the network of telephone users.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Packet switching is used by most data networks. WANs and
 hubs are not switching types of WAN technology.
 2. þ A. With a packet-switching network, the failed portion will be routed around the point of
 failure to continue to deliver packets.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. In a circuit-switched network, the connection will be
 terminated. For example, if you are speaking with someone on the telephone and a telephone
 line breaks, the call is terminated and must be made again. WANs and hubs are not switching
 types of WAN technology.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode
 3. þ C and D are correct. ATM technology can be used to create LANs and connect them to
 a WAN.
 ý A and B are incorrect. Dial-up is a type of connection made from one PC to another, or
 even possibly a LAN to a LAN. A workgroup is a group of ten or fewer PCs that are connected
 to share resources with no centralized administration point.
 4. þ C. ATM uses consistent 53-byte cells.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. The payload in the cell is 48 bytes, and the header is 5 bytes,
 totaling 53 bytes.

Synchronous Optical network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
 5. þ A. The SONET network will multiplex multiple streams into one stream and transmit this
 single stream over the SONET network. Multiple streams can be combined to form the single
 SONET data stream.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect amounts.
 6. þ B. The synchronous transport signal (STS) is in the form of electrical pulses.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. The electrical pulses are converted by the PTE into one stream
 and are sent to the LTE as light pulses on fiber-optic cable. STM is a term used to denote the
 different levels of SDH. 466 Chapter 9: Wide Area Network Technologies



 7. þ D. The scrambler is used to randomize the stream pattern to allow the data to be
 encrypted. This requires a descrambler on the other end of the connection to convert the data
 into a usable form.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. The multiplexer is used to generate one data stream from many
 data streams. The electrical pulses are converted by the PTE into one stream and are sent to the
 LTE as light pulses on fiber-optic cable.
 8. þ B. One SONET level is 51.84 Mbps. If more are added, the value is multiplied by the
 number of levels.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect speeds.

optical Carrier Level-X
 9. þ B and C are correct. The OC levels are standards for transmitting over fiber-optic cable.
 The levels match those of SONET and SDH, which require fiber optics.
 ý A and D are incorrect. ATM and T1 do not have the same standards.
10. þ D. 192 is the highest level currently set for OC.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect; they are not the highest OC levels.

x.25 and frame relay
11. þ D. Frame Relay depends on the protocols used to manage error checking.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect because Frame Relay depends on the protocols used to manage
 error checking.
12. þ D. Just because a device is requested to slow transmissions, that does not mean the device
 will perform the action.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect; they are not valid choices.
13. þ C. The packets will be delivered if the bandwidth is available; if it is not, they will be
 dropped.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. The state of the network must be taken into account.

fiber Distributed Data interface (fDDi)
14. þ C. The part that is used for redundancy is the portion of the primary ring that has not
 failed as well as the same part of the secondary ring that has not failed.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. No part of the failed portion of the primary ring can be used,
 and neither can the same portion of the secondary ring. Self Test Answers 467


15. þ C. The token is circulated in opposite directions. This helps to keep the flow of the token
 the same on both rings even after a failure.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. The token passes only from one ring to the other when a failure
 has occurred. The token is not randomly moved, nor does the token move in the same direction
 on both rings.
16. þ B. FDDI operates at 100 Mbps, whether it is fiber or copper cabling.

 Y ou have learned about networking hardware components such as routers, switches, hubs,
 and network cabling thus far in the book. Being able to identify these components and
 connect them together is just a small part of implementing the network; you also need
 to install and configure the network operating system (NOS) on the server to publish resources
 out to the network.

 In this chapter you will learn to implement a network by installing the network
 operating system, creating user accounts and groups, and subsequently assigning
 permissions to those user accounts for network resources such as files, folders, and
 printers.



CertifiCation objeCtive 10.01


installing a network
 Installing the network is one of the first job responsibilities that you may have as a
 network professional. This duty may include purchasing server hardware, the server
 NOS, and client desktop systems. You will also need to make choices regarding the
 type of network you wish to install—will you choose a Novell, Microsoft, or Linux
 networking environment? Will you go with a peer-to-peer or client/server network?
 Will you have a mixed environment with a few Microsoft servers and a few Linux or
 Novell servers? This section will help you answer these questions.


networking options
 Looking back to Chapter 1, you learned the difference between a peer-to-peer
 networking environment and a server-based one. You will now need to choose which
 type of network you intend to build. If you choose to build a peer-to-peer network,
 you will not be required to purchase server hardware and the network operating
 system, thereby reducing cost. The disadvantage of a peer-to-peer network is that it
 is typically limited to ten systems.
 If you choose to go with a server-based network, you will need to purchase the
 server hardware and the server network operating system, so you can expect some
 additional cost. You will also need to obtain client access licenses. A client access
 license (CAL) is needed to allow the client to connect to the network operating Installing a Network 471


system. It is important to understand that just because you have purchased the server
operating system, that does not mean that you can allow everyone to access data on
the server. You will need to purchase a CAL for each client connecting.
 Let us say that we have decided to go with a server-based network. When it
comes to server-based networking environments, you have three popular types to
choose from—Microsoft, Novell, and Linux.

Microsoft networking
When it comes to networking, Microsoft networking environments have a big
market share these days, with Windows Server 2003 being the most popular
Windows server version on existing networks. Windows Server 2008 is the newest
version of Microsoft’s network operating system as of the date of this writing. When
you install a Microsoft server, you will have to make a number of choices such
as deciding whether to install a standalone server, a member server, or a domain
controller.

standalone system A standalone server is a server that has a local Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) database similar to a Windows XP system. The SAM
database is a database of accounts that resides on the local system and is used to
access resources on the local system only. This is very similar to having a number of
Windows XP systems in a workgroup (peer-to-peer) environment—the accounts are
not “network” accounts; they are local accounts.
 You may install a standalone server if this server is to act as your web server
or firewall system. Typically, these systems are not part of the normal “Microsoft
network,” otherwise called a domain, because they are connected to the Internet.

Domain Controller A domain controller (DC) is a server that has Microsoft’s
directory service installed, known as Active Directory. The Active Directory
database is the term used by Microsoft for the network account database. If you are
authenticated by, or you log on to, the Active Directory database, you can access
resources across the network. The account is not used just to access resources on the
local system, as is the case with the standalone system.
 When a user logs on to the network, the logon request is sent to the domain
controller on the network where the account information is verified. Once the
domain controller has verified the information, the user can access network
resources to which they have access anywhere on the network. The term for this
Microsoft network is a domain. 472 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 When installing a Microsoft domain environment, you need to be familiar with a
 few more terms—trees and forests. It is possible that a large organization may want
 to create a network environment that contains multiple domains. The following
 terms relate to Microsoft network environments:

 n Domain A logical grouping of computers and resources. Users log on to the
 domain and can be authenticated by any domain controller in the domain.
 A domain is a security boundary and a replication boundary.
 n Trees A hierarchy of domains that have a contiguous DNS namespace. For
 example, if you have a domain named companyabc.loc, you may have a child
 domain for each region such as eastern, central, or western, or maybe for each
 country, such as the United States and Canada. Each domain will have a full
 domain name that includes the domain name joined by the parent domain
 (companyabc.loc) as shown in Figure 10-1.
 n Forest A forest is made up of one or more trees. In the Active Directory
 world you will always have a domain, a tree, and a forest. It is just a question
 of how many domains make up this tree-and-forest structure. Each tree in the
 forest has its own DNS namespace and has a trust relationship to the forest
 root domain (the first domain installed in the forest).

Directory forest

 Member server A member server is a machine that is part of a domain, or a
 member of the domain, and typically is a resource that users would access once they
 have been authenticated by a domain controller. A member server may be a server
 that is in the domain that performs any kind of function on the network, such as
 being a file and print server, a database server, or an e-mail server. The difference
 between a member server and a standalone server is simply that a standalone server
 is not part of a domain, so it cannot take advantage of the fact that a domain con-
 troller has authenticated the user. This means that the standalone server is respon-
 sible for authenticating the user when someone connects to the system. Figure 10-2
 displays a typical domain environment in the Microsoft world.

 novell netWare
 Novell’s NetWare has been one of the leading networking environments for many
 years. Novell’s directory service is currently called “eDirectory.” Like Active Directory,
 it is a database of network accounts that is automatically synchronized with other
 servers. One or more NetWare servers sharing the same eDirectory database is called an
 eDirectory Tree. The administrator decides which servers in which geographic locations
 will hold a copy of the eDirectory database. One of the major benefits of eDirectory is
 that you are not limited to installing it on NetWare servers. eDirectory can be installed
 on NetWare servers, Windows servers, Linux servers, and UNIX servers.
 With NetWare 6.5, Novell includes a number
 of dirXML drivers, which allow eDirectory to
 synchronize user information with any other
 type of directory service, such as Microsoft
 In the real world you Active Directory, PeopleSoft, LotusNotes,
 probably care about eDirectory and Microsoft Exchange, LDAP servers, and so on.
 maybe NDS only because they are used in Novell’s directory service has evolved over
 more current versions of NetWare, but be the years and, as a result, has changed names
 familiar with all three terms for the exam. a few times. The following is a listing of the
 different names given to their directory service
 and a description of each:

 n Bindery NetWare 2.x and 3.x use this; it is a network account database that
 is stored on each server, but it is not synchronized with any other servers.
 n NDS Novell Directory Services; NetWare 4.x and 5.x use this—it is a
 network account database that is synchronized between servers.
 n eDirectory Supersedes NDS; supports efficient storage of billions of
 objects—almost every aspect of Novell environment configurations is stored
 in eDirectory.

 Linux
 Linux is starting to command a lot of attention in the IT industry because of its
 reliability and its secure architecture. Linux has a fairly limited directory service
 compared to Novell’s eDirectory or Microsoft’s Active Directory, but Novell is
 helping in this area by allowing eDirectory to run on Linux servers. This will help
 Novell and Linux capture more market share in the networking world.
 Linux (and UNIX) environments can store user account information in files
 (/etc/passwd holds user account information, /etc/shadow holds encrypted user
 passwords, and /etc/group holds group membership information). Without a Installing a Network 475


 directory service, this information is specific to each server. Network Information
 Service (NIS) is commonly used to replicate user account information between
 servers, but many vendors, such as Sun and IBM, offer modified and enhanced
 versions of NIS for this purpose.


network requirements
 This section introduces the hardware and software requirements for building a
 network. We will review the hardware that is required and then discuss the software
 requirements needed for a network. This section is in effect a summary of the
 network components you have already learned about in Chapter 3.

 networking Hardware
 The first thing that you will need in each of the systems or hosts that will participate
 on the network is a network interface card, which is the means the system uses to
 send and receive data on the network. You will also need to have a hub or a switch
 to act as a central connection point for all the systems. If your systems are going to
 send data to another network, you will need a router as well. Figure 10-3 displays the
 general setup of the networking hardware.

 Server
 Workstation 476 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 The networking server will also need to have its specs measured out. Today’s
 server will include a RAID controller card that connects and manages the RAID
 drives. There should be more than 1GB of RAM, depending on the role of the
 server. If the server is intended to act as a mail server or a database server, you may
 want a few gigabytes of memory as well as multiple CPUs on the motherboard.

 networking software
 It is extremely important to understand what the network’s software requirements are.
 Certainly, you will need all four of the following software components somewhere on
 the network.

 n Service A service is what is being provided to clients on the network—it
 is typically the reason for the network. For example, most networks have a
 server that offers file and printer sharing services, or maybe web services that
 offer web pages to web clients on the network. Without a service there is no
 purpose to the network.
 n Client A client is a piece of software that connects to the service and makes
 the network request. For example, Internet Explorer is a client that makes
 requests to a web server (service) for different web pages on the web server.
 Another example is the Client for Microsoft Networks (shown in Figure 10-4),
 which allows users to connect to any Microsoft file and print server.
 n Protocol A protocol is the networking language that a system uses to
 send the request from the client to the service. If you want two systems to
 communicate, they will need to speak the same language (protocol), such as
 TCP/IP or NetBEUI.
 n Network card driver In order for all of this to work, you will need to make
 sure that the network card driver has been installed on the system so that the
 system can send and receive data. If the network card driver has not been
 installed, you will be unable to configure the system for clients, protocols, or
 services.

 You can verify that you have the software components to network the Microsoft
 operating system by going to your LAN Connection properties as shown in Figure 10-4.

 Just as a side note, in order to connect to older Novell servers (predating
 NetWare 6), you will need to make sure that you have a Novell client installed
 on the system. NetWare 6.x servers allow users to use a web browser to access all
 network resources. In order to connect to a Microsoft server, you will need to make
 sure that you have a Microsoft client installed.


installing a network server
 In this section you will learn to install a network server by installing Windows
 Server 2003 and then configure it as a domain controller for glensworld.loc. After
 the installation of this server, you will learn to create users and groups on the server.
 When installing a Windows server, you want to make sure that you plan for
 installation by deciding on a number of settings and other issues, such as

 n Server name You will need to decide what the name of the server will be.
 Clients will connect to the server by name when accessing folders and printers.
 n Domain name If your server will be joining a domain, you will need to type
 in the name of the domain. If you are joining a domain, you will also need
 to know the username and password of the administrator account that has
 permission to add servers to the domain. If you will be a domain controller for
 a domain, you will accomplish that with the dcpromo.exe command, so you
 should have planned in advance what your domain name will be. 478 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 n Server as domain controller You will need to know before you start the
 installation whether or not the server will be a domain controller, because
 if the server is to be a domain controller, you will install it as a standalone
 server and then run dcpromo.exe to promote it to a domain controller.
 n Hardware support Make sure that your server hardware (network card, video
 card, and the like) will work with the server operating system by checking out
 the Windows Server Catalog at www.windowsservercatalog.com.
 n Partition setup During the installation, you will have the opportunity
 to create and delete the partitions on the hard disk of the server. Plan your
 partition strategy before the installation so that you are prepared for this step
 during installation.
 n File system After partitioning the disk, you will need to format the
 partition with a file system such as FAT32 or NTFS. For security reasons you
 should always go with the NTFS file system on Microsoft servers.
 n Licensing When installing a Windows server, you will have to choose
 either Per Seat or Per Server licensing. With Per Server licensing, you obtain
 a client access license (CAL) for each connection to the server. During the
 installation of the server you will need to specify how many simultaneous
 connections you expect. With Per Seat licensing, you purchase a license for
 each individual client that will access the server. The difference between the
 two is illustrated in this example: If you have ten users accessing two different
 servers, with Per Server licensing you need 20 licenses, while with Per Seat
 licensing you only need ten licenses, or one license for each client, no matter
 how many servers are being accessed.

 In order to install the Windows Server operating system, you will first need to
 place your Windows Server 2003 CD in the CD-ROM drive and then power on the
 computer. The system boots off the CD and then starts the installation. There are
 two phases to the installation process:

 n Text-mode phase The first is the text-mode portion of the installation,
 where you partition the disk and format the partition. Then the setup files are
 copied from the CD-ROM to the hard drive.
 n GUI-mode phase The GUI-mode portion of the installation will ask for
 information such as your product key, computer name, and administrator
 password. Installing a Network 479


 Let’s walk through the steps to install Windows Server 2003, and then you will
 create a domain controller that runs the Active Directory database. This domain
 controller will be referred to in all the remaining discussions and exercises in this
 chapter.

 1. Place your Windows Server 2003 CD in the drive and then power on the
 computer.
 2. After some setup files are copied to the system, the Welcome To Setup

CertifiCation objeCtive 10.02


Creating user accounts
 Now that you have the server installed, you will first need to make sure that each
 user that will access the network has a network user account to log on to the
 network with. A user account is a network object that users on the network use to
 prove their identity to the network. Once the user logs on with a valid username
 and password, the user will be able to access resources on the network, such as files,
 folders, and printers that the user account has permission for.


built-in accounts
 Before learning how to build a user account for each employee or individual that
 will access the network, it is important to understand that each operating system has
 built-in accounts. A built-in account is an account that comes already installed with
 the operating system and serves a specific purpose.
 There are a few built-in accounts that you should be familiar with for the
 Network+ exam. Each of these accounts is typically used to perform the initial
 administrative tasks on the server, such as creating user accounts and groups.
 Table 10-1 displays some popular built-in accounts.
 The password for these built-in administrative accounts is normally determined
 during the installation of the operating system. It is important to be sure that you
 know that password so that you can log on as that account. Therefore, be sure
 to make note of the password during the installation and be sure to use a strong
 password—one that is not easily guessed or cracked. It is also wise to rename the
 default administrative accounts for security reasons.


Creating user accounts
 Now that you have learned about built-in accounts, let’s take a look at how to create
 and manage user accounts. To create a user account, first make sure that you are
 comfortable with the naming convention you will use for these accounts. The naming
 convention is typically made up of the user’s first and last name. A popular naming
 convention is to use the first initial of the first name and then use the entire last name.
 For example, for my user account you might use a username of gclarke. Once you have
 decided on the naming convention, you are ready to create your user accounts. 486 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network

 you are creating a local user account in the SAM database of that system. This user
 account will be able to access resources only on the local system; it is typically used
 where there is no Active Directory environment.
 To create a local user account, go to the Computer Management console in the
 Administrative Tools. Once in the Computer Management console, expand the
 Local Users And Groups folder on the left. Next, right-click the Users folder and
 choose New User to create a new user account as shown in Figure 10-14.
 Once the New User dialog box appears, type a username and the user’s full
 name. You can also type the description of the user account, such as Accounting
 Department. Once you have filled in the name information, you can fill in the
 password for the user account and confirm the password, as shown in Figure 10-15. Creating User Accounts 487

 You will notice that there are four additional options at the bottom of the New
 User dialog box. They are listed with a description, as follows:

 n User must change password at next logon Select this option if you are
 planning on setting a temporary password for the account and you want to have
 users change the password once they log on with the account. If you select this
 option, Windows will force the user to change the password at logon. 488 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 n User cannot change password Select this option if you want to control
 the user account password and you do not want users to change their
 own passwords. You may set this for a user account that is shared between
 employees if you want to ensure that one user does not change the password
 for another user.
 n Password never expires Select this option if you don’t want this user
 account to have its password expire based on a policy that forces users to
 change their password every 30 days. For whatever reason, you have decided
 that this account is an exception to the password changing policy.
 n Account is disabled You may disable an account at any time. If a user goes
 on an extended leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), you may want
 to disable the account so that it cannot be used. When the employee comes
 back, you can simply enable the account by deselecting the check box!

 Once you have your desired settings typed in and selected, you can create the
 account by clicking Create. Once you click Create, you should see the user account
 in the Users folder.

 Creating a user account in active Directory
 User accounts that are created in the local SAM database cannot be used to access
 other systems on the network. This becomes a huge problem in most networking
 environments because you do not want to create the account on each system that
 the user will access. This is the purpose of creating an Active Directory account.
 An Active Directory account is a “network” account. When a user is authenticated
 by Active Directory, that user will have access to every system on the network,
 assuming that account has been given permission to access those systems.
 As a network administrator in a Windows environment, you want to create your
 accounts in a central directory such as Active Directory so that you do not have to
 keep building network accounts on each local system.
 To create network user accounts in the Active Directory database, go to your
 server and launch Active Directory Users and Computers from the Administrative
 Tools (as shown in Figure 10-16).
 Once you started the Active Directory Users and Computers console, you can
 now create a user account by right-clicking and choosing New User. Each user
 account can be placed in what is called an Organizational Unit (OU). The OU is
 designed to allow you to group user accounts that require the same policy settings
 or desktop restrictions. In Figure 10-17 you can see that a new user account is being
 created in the Halifax OU. Creating User Accounts 489

 When creating the new user account, you will need to give details such as the
 first name, last name, and full name of the account (see Figure 10-18). You will also
 need to specify the user logon name—this is the name that the user will log on to
 the network with.

 To practice creating user accounts in Active Directory check out Exercise 10-3

 Creating a user account in Linux
 If you have a Linux or a UNIX operating system, you may create users on your Linux
 or UNIX server so that users can access resources on those systems. To create a user
 account in Red Hat Linux, click the Red Hat icon at the bottom left of the screen
 and select System Settings | Users And Groups as shown in Figure 10-19.
 Once you are in the Red Hat User Manager tool, you may create a user account
 by clicking the Add User button in the top-left corner of the screen. Once you click
 Add User, you are presented with the Create New User dialog box, in which you will
 need to fill in the user account information, as shown in Figure 10-20.

 shadow. Any group the user is a member of is
 reflected in /etc/group.



Password Policies
 When creating your user accounts, make sure that you create strong passwords. Also
 make sure that when users changes their passwords, they follow guidelines for strong
 passwords. What is a strong password? A strong, or complex, password is one that
 meets the following requirements:

 n It is not the same as the user’s logon name.
 n It has a minimum of six (preferably eight) characters.
 n It uses a mixture of uppercase and lowercase characters.
 n It uses a mixture of letters, numbers, and symbols.

 The problem lies in making sure that users follow these guidelines. It is extremely
 easy to explain to users that they should not choose their pet name as a password,
 but you need to be certain that when you walk away they don’t change their
 password to a “weak” one that can be easily guessed. To ensure that passwords are
 strong passwords, you can build a password policy. A password policy, once enabled,
 will not allow users to have weak passwords. Table 10-2 lists some popular password
 policy settings.
 To configure a password policy in your Windows networking environment,
 select Start | Administrative Tools | Default Domain Controller Policy. Once in
 the Domain Controller Policy, expand Account Policies and then select Password
 Policy, as shown in Figure 10-21.

Password Policy
Settings Enforce Enforcing password history means that the server maintains a given
 password number of passwords previously chosen by a user and the user will not be
 history able to choose a password that was already used within the duration of
 that history. For example, I normally configure my servers to remember
 at least 12 passwords, so users will not be able to reuse a password that
 they have chosen 12 times ago.
 Maximum This setting limits the user to having a password for a maximum amount
 password age of time. Normally, I set this to 30 days, which means that the user can
 keep a password for 30 days; after that it will expire, and the user will
 need to set a new one.
 Minimum Setting the minimum password age means that a user cannot change
 password age their password for the amount of time specified after it has been
 changed. For example, if you force users to change their passwords every
 30 days you may not want them to change it for a minimum of 2 days
 after that, so you can set the minimum password age to 2.
 Minimum The password must have a minimum number of characters. The more
 password characters in a password, the harder it is to crack, because you have

 the recommendation for a minimum password length.

Managing groups
 Once you have created user accounts for your users, you are ready to organize
 those users into groups. The purpose of creating a group is to allow you to assign
 permissions or rights on the network to the group. This way, all the users that are
 members of that group will get the permission or right. For example, if you place
 all of the accountants in a group called Accountants, when you assign permissions
 to the accounting team you can assign the permissions once—to the Accountants
 group; any user who is a member of the group will inherit those permissions.
 Groups are also a great way to facilitate role changes within the organization.
 For example, if you have a new accountant named Bob, you can create the Bob user
 account and place him in the Accountants group. You will not need to configure the
 permissions for Bob to access the accounting folder because the group already has
 the permission. This means that you are working smart as a network administrator
 and are using features of the network that facilitate change.


built-in groups
 Before discussing how to create your own groups it is important to understand that
 there are built-in groups within the network operating system. A built-in group is
 like a built-in user account in the sense that the group is installed with the operating
 system and has a predefined purpose within the operating system. The following
 subsections describe the popular built-in groups found in a Windows operating
 system.

 administrators
 The Administrators local group is the most powerful of all the groups. As you might
 expect, users in this group have full control of the local system. This means that
 this group is responsible for managing the local system and has the capabilities to
 perform any action on the computer. For this reason, only trusted users should be
 members of this elite group. By default, the Domain Admins global group and the
 Administrator account are members of the Administrators local group. Managing Groups 495


users
The Users local group is a group that all users are members of, and this group has
sufficient capabilities to log on to the desktop operating system and run applications
that have been installed by the network administrator. The Domain Users global
group is a member of the Users local group by default.

server operators
The Server Operators group is intended to relieve the burden on the administrator
by being able to perform selected server administration tasks. Members of this group
can shut down servers, format server hard disks, create and modify shares, lock and
unlock the server, back up and restore files, and change the system time.

Print operators
Users in the Print Operators local group have the capability to create, delete, and
modify printers on a Windows system. Printing is one of the most common areas
of troubleshooting on the network, and this group is used to alleviate the printing
responsibility from the Administrators group.

backup operators
Members of the Backup Operators local group can back up and restore files
and folders on a Windows system. This group is designed to take over the daily
responsibility of doing backups from the Administrators group. Backup Operators
can log on to and shut down the server, if needed.

account operators
Users in the Account Operators group have permissions to add, modify, and delete
user and group accounts in the domain. The Account Operators group is used
to create additional user accounts; However, it cannot change characteristics of
Administrator accounts or modify members of the Administrators group.

Domain admins
The Domain Admins global group is a member of the Administrators local group on
every computer in the domain by default. To create a network administrator account
(as opposed to creating a computer administrator), you should place the user account
in the Domain Admins group; then the user can manage any system in the domain. 496 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 Domain users
 The Domain Users global group contains all user accounts created in the domain.
 The Domain Users global group is, by default, a member of the Users local group on
 every Windows system in the domain. If you need to assign permissions to all users
 on the network, it is recommended that you give permission to the Users group that
 contains the Domain Users group (which is all network users).
 Placing users into these built-in groups gives them predefined administrative
 rights within the Windows operating system and Windows Server network operating
 systems. It is important to always place a user in the group that gives that user the
 minimum number of rights. For example, although the Administrators group and the
 Backup Operators group can perform backups, if you want a particular person to do
 backups, you should place that person in Backup Operators because administrators
 can perform any administrative tasks.


Creating groups
 You can also create your own groups within most network operating systems,
 which will allow you to assign permissions to groups of individuals in one action.
 To create a group within Active Directory, right-click an OU within Active
 Directory Users and Computers and choose New | Group, as shown in Figure 10-22.



 figure 10-22

Creating a new
group in Active
Directory Managing Groups 497


 When you create a new group in Active Directory, you will need to choose one of
 two groups:

 n Distribution A distribution group is a group that is used by e-mail
 applications to send an e-mail to a number of users at once. This is known as
 a distribution list in a number of e-mail systems.
 n Security A security group is a group that is used to assign permissions to
 groups of people at a time. A security group is also used to e-mail a number
 of people at once.

 When creating a new group, you must also choose the group scope. The purpose
 of each group scope is given in the following list:

 n Global A global group is used to organize users within an Active Directory
 domain. This group scope can contain any user or global group that exists
 within the same domain as the global group.
 n Domain local A domain local group is used to assign permissions or rights
 to groups of people within the domain. Domain local groups can contain
 users or groups from any domain in the enterprise.
 n Universal A universal group is used to organize users across domains
 within the enterprise. For example, if you want to have a group called
 AllSales that contains the Sales group from two different domains, you will
 use a universal group to create the AllSales group but use global groups for
 the two Sales groups.


 To practice building groups, try Exercise 10-5 in LabBook.pdf. Also, check out
CertCam 10–5

 Creating a group in Linux
 You can create groups within the Linux environment just as easily as you can within
 the Windows environment. To create a group within Linux, click the Red Hat icon
 located in the bottom-left corner and then choose System Settings | Users and
 Groups. Once the Red Hat User Manager tool appears, click the Groups tab at the
 top to see a list of existing groups, as shown in Figure 10-23. 498 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network

securing files and folders
 In this section you will learn to secure folders and files by assigning permissions
 to users and groups within the various network operating systems. You will not be
 expected to be a security expert for the Network+ exam, but you should be familiar
 with some of the basic permissions found in the operating systems in current use.


securing files in Windows
 In the Windows operating systems, once you have your users and groups built, you
 can then secure the folders and files on these systems so that only certain users can 500 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 access certain folders. For example, you want to make sure that only accountants can
 get access to the accounting folder.
 There are two steps to securing folders on a Windows server: first you must
 secure the folder with NTFS permissions, and then you must set share permissions
 when you share the folder out to the network.
 Sharing the folder out to the network is the
 way you “publish” the folder to your Windows
 When NTFS permissions clients. Users can connect to shared folders

 folder. The following list summarizes NTFS
 permissions and sharing:

 n NTFS permissions These can be applied only to NTFS partitions. If you
 are not using NTFS, you can convert to NTFS from FAT or FAT32. Once
 you set the NTFS permissions, they will apply when the user accesses the
 folder either locally or from across the network.
 n Sharing Sharing the folder is the way you publish the folder to the network
 clients. When you share the folder, you specify share permissions as well. Be
 sure to remember that when the NTFS permissions conflict with share folder
 permissions, the most restrictive permission wins. For example, if you give
 the NTFS permission of modify and the share permission of read, when users
 come through the share to access that folder, their permission will be read
 because it is most restrictive.


 ntfs Permissions
 There are a number of NTFS permissions that you should be familiar with when it
 comes to securing folders; the popular NTFS permissions are listed in Table 10-3.

 shared folder Permissions
 Once you secure the folders with NTFS permissions, you will need to share the
 folder to publish it to the network. When sharing the folders, you will need to
 configure shared folder permissions. There are a few shared folder permissions that
 you should be familiar with when it comes to securing folders that are shared out on
 the network. Be aware that when a share permission is applied to a folder, it will be
 retained for all subfolders as well. For example, if you share the data folder and users Securing Files and Folders 501


 have the change permission, when users connect to the data share they will have
 the change share permission and when they double-click a subfolder they will still
 have it. You will rely on NTFS to change the permissions at each subfolder level if
 needed. The share permissions are listed in Table 10-4.


 tabLe 10-3
 ntfs Permission Description
Popular NTFS List Folder Contents This is a permission assigned to a folder; it allows a user to
Permissions view the contents of the folder but not necessarily to “read”
 the contents of files in the folder.
 Read This is a folder and file permission that enables a user to open
 and read the contents of files.
 Read&amp;Execute This is a folder and file permission that allows users to read the
 contents of files and to execute an executable.
 Write This is a file and folder permission that allows a user to modify
 the contents of a file (write to it) or to create a new file or
 folder within that folder.
 Modify This is a folder or file permission that includes all the
 permissions mentioned previously. Having the Modify
 permission allows a user to read, execute, delete, list folder
 contents, and write to the contents of the folder or file.
 Full Control This is a folder or file permission that gives a user all
 permissions possible. If you assign the Full Control permission,
 the user will be able to modify the contents of the file but also
 change the permissions on the resource as well.



 tabLe 10-4 share Permission Description
Share Permissions Read This share permission enables a user to open and read the
in Windows contents of files within the share.
 Change This share permission enables a user to open and read the
 contents of files within the share, create new files, and change
 the contents of files within the share.
 Full Control This share permission enables a user to open and read the
 contents of files within the share, create new files, change the
 contents of files within the share, and change permissions on
 the share. This permission is typically not assigned to users on
 the network. 502 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network

Connecting to a shared folder
 Once you have configured the permissions on the Windows folder and have shared
 it out to the network, your clients will need to know how to connect to the shared
 folder. There are a number of ways to connect to the shared folder; two of my
 personal favorite methods are to use the run command and then connect to the
 UNC path of the shared folder, or to map a network drive to the shared folder.

 n UNC path The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path is a standard
 naming convention to connect to network resources. A UNC path is made up
 of two symbols followed by the name of the computer, another , and then
 the name of the share. For example, if you had a shared folder named data on
 a server called SERVER1, the UNC path would be SERVER1DATA.
 The beautiful thing about UNC paths is that once you know the name of the
 server and the share, you can quickly connect by typing the UNC path in
 the run command! 506 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 n Mapped network drive Some users are not comfortable with UNC paths
 and don’t know what they are, let alone how to connect to a UNC path. To
 make your network easier to use, you would normally create mapped network
 drives on the user’s computer. A mapped network drive is a drive in My
 Computer that does not connect to a drive on the local system but points to
 a folder on a server somewhere. You can always tell which drives are referring
 to a folder on a network server because the icon has a cable underneath the
 drive, as shown in Figure 10-25.

 To map a network drive, right-click My Computer and choose the Map Network
 Drive command, as shown in Figure 10-26.
 In the Map Network Drive dialog box you specify the drive letter you would like
 to create and then specify the location to the shared folder that this drive will point
 to. You can also specify whether this mapped network drive should be created the
 next time the user logs on by selecting the Reconnect At Logon option, as shown in
 Figure 10-27.

securing files in Linux
 Securing files in Linux is a little bit different. There are three permissions for files
 and folders, each having a numeric value:

 n Read (R) 4
 n Write (W) 2
 n Execute (X) 1

 There are also three entities that can have these three permissions to a file or
 folder: the file owner, a group, and everyone else.
 The chmod (change mode) command is used to set these permissions. For
 example, chmod u=rwx /myfile.txt would set Read, Write, and Execute for the
 file owner (u) to the file named myfile.txt. The foregoing command could also be
 expressed using chmod 700 /myfile.txt, where 7 assigns read, write, and execute to
 the file owner while assigning nothing to the group and everyone else.
 For another example, chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r /myfile.txt grants the file owner
 (u) read, write, and execute, allows a group (g) to read and write, and allows
 everyone else (o) only read access. Expressed numerically, the command would be
 chmod 764 /myfile.txt. Keep in mind that if you’re using chmod to set permissions
 on a folder, you should use the -R switch to recursively change permissions for all
 subordinate files and folders.



CertifiCation objeCtive 10.05


installing Printers
 Another type of resource that appears on the network along with files and folders is
 printers. Being able to share a printer with other users on the network is one of the
 fundamental reasons for having a network. This section covers installing a printer
 and sharing it out to the network.
 Before we get into the steps to configure a printer, let’s take a look at some
 terminology that deals with printing. The following terms are used a lot in networking
 environments to describe the printing environment: Installing Printers 509


 n Print device The print device is the physical printer that takes paper and
 outputs the printout—in our terms it is the “printer.”
 n Printer The printer is the software interface to the print device. The
 printer is the little icon that appears in your printer folder and allows you to
 configure the settings through the properties of the printer. You can open the
 printer to see the print jobs that have been submitted. This is also termed the
 print queue in some environments.
 n Print server A print server is the machine that holds the shared printer.
 Remember that the printer is the icon and not the physical print device. The
 print server is where clients submit their print jobs. Figure 10-28 displays the
 relationship between the various printing terms.

 Workstation 510 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network




Creating a Print server
 To install a print server in the Windows environment, run the Add Printer Wizard
 on the Windows Server 2003 machine. Clients connect to this shared printer to
 submit their print jobs.
 When installing a printer on the server, run the Add Printer Wizard and select
 that you are installing a local printer (shown in Figure 10-29). The term local
 printer means that the printer is a resource of the server and you will manage the
 printer on that system. Management of the printer could involve things such as
 adding additional drivers, configuring a schedule, or configuring permissions.
 After specifying that you wish to install a local printer in the Add Printer Wizard,
 you will then need to specify the port the printer is connected to. The port could be
 a local port such as LPT1 or could be a standard TCP/IP port. A standard TCP/IP
 port is the port type you use if the print device is connected directly to the network
 with a network card and has an IP address assigned to it.
 After specifying the port type, you will then be asked for the manufacturer and
 model of the printer. After specifying the model, you will then need to specify a
 share name for the printer (shown in Figure 10-30). The printer must be shared
 in order for clients to connect to it, and print to it, from across the network. The
 printer is shared in the same way that a folder is shared, but it is nice that the Add
 Printer Wizard gives the option to share the printer.

 To practice installing a print server, follow the steps given in Exercise 10-7 in

Changing Printer Permissions
 Once the printer has been installed, you can then go to the properties of the printer
 to change its settings. One of the popular settings you may want to change is who
 has permission to print to the printer. To change the permissions on the printer,
 follow these steps:

 1. Once the printer is installed, right-click the printer and choose Properties
 (as shown in Figure 10-31).

printer properties 512 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 2. Select the Security tab; then select the Everyone group and click Remove.
 3. Click Add and then type sales and choose OK. In my example I have added
 the sales group to the permission list and given the print permission as shown
 in Figure 10-32.
 4. Click OK.
 5. Close all windows.


Configuring a Print Client
 Once the printer has been installed on the server, which now makes the server a print
 server, you are ready to connect clients to the printer so that they can print. To install
 a printer on the client, run the Add Printer Wizard and select Network Printer as
 the type of printer you want to install (as shown in Figure 10-33). The term network
 printer means that you want to install a printer that references a printer located on a
 print server and you will reference this printer by its share name. For example, in the
 preceding section you installed a shared printer on the Windows 2003 Server, and if a
 client wishes to reference it, the client will specify a UNC path of
 win2003-Asales

 Any print jobs destined for the network printer will be redirected to the network
 print server to handle the print request. The printout will print to whatever print
 device the print server is pointing to; in our case, LPT1.

 Printing in Linux
 CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) is the standard printing environment used
 in Linux. It includes support for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), Line Printer
 Daemon (LPD), and Line Printer Remote (LPR), among other standards.
 LPD is a daemon (or service) that must be running on the Linux server; LPR
 refers to the Linux client. There are some basic Linux commands to control printing:

 n lp Sends print jobs to a Linux printer—for example, lp myfile.txt.
 n lpstat Displays all configured printers and their print job status.

Working with network Hardware
 This section reviews the networking hardware that is required for the network
 to function and identifies potential issues surrounding networking hardware and
 networking equipment. 514 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network




environmental factors that affect Computer networks
 Most networks have a centrally located area that can safely house all network
 appliances and servers. This is typically known as a server room. Within this
 room are a multitude of special features that can help protect the computers and
 other environmentally “sensitive” equipment from failing as a result of extreme
 temperatures.
 Because computers are affected by temperature, moisture, vibrations, and
 electrical interference, you need to create a controlled environment in which you
 can control each of these elements. If the computers are exposed to these elements,
 they can act irregularly and sometimes fail. Luckily, standards protect computer
 components from some of these situations.

 Underneath the protection of most network cables lies a fragile layer of wire (or
 glass, in the case of fiber optics) that carries the data from one computer to another.
 Like most other computer components, this wire is not resistant to moisture, heat,
 or other electrical interference. To protect this
 cable from harm, a covering is placed over the
 wire to keep it from breaking or accidentally
 becoming wet. The main reason for the covering

 sprinkler system would ruin all your computer equipment. Many types of foams or
 halon are used to put out fires quickly and safely while minimizing the potential
 damage to your computer equipment. The laws of your geographical area could
 require that you not use certain types of fire control methods. Some states require
 older systems to be upgraded within a certain amount of time and consider older
 fire control methods dangerous.

 Computer Chassis
 With the rapid advances in today’s technology, computers are faster than ever. Today
 there is more computing power on a single laptop computer than was used by NASA
 to place the first man on the moon. However, more computing power comes at a
 price, and the price that we pay is heat. As processors become faster and faster, they
 become hotter and hotter as they perform billions of calculations. The scenario is
 the same for disk drives. The larger the drives become, the more work that needs to
 be done to find the data on the drive. The result is that the temperature within the
 PC’s chassis becomes too hot for the computer to operate. When this happens, the
 overheating part fails or destroys the PC altogether.
 To combat this problem, a cooling fan (or multiple fans) is placed inside the
 PC to circulate the air and prevent the PC from overheating. Some of the more
 inventive computer chassis help circulate the air inside the PC to keep the computer
 cool. The room in which the servers are placed should also be air-conditioned. The
 air in the PC chassis can only be as cool as the air it is circulating from the room in
 which it is placed.
 One of the things that a number of organizations forget to do as part of their
 maintenance plan is to clean the inside of the computer. The collection of dust
 in the system can create problems with the cooling techniques used by the PC
 manufacturer. I remember trying to fix a client’s computer that continued to crash.
 After trying everything, I opened the case and found that the cooling fan on the
 processor was jammed with dust. I reached for my can of compressed air and gave the
 system a good cleaning—problem fixed in five minutes!


Common Peripheral Ports and network Components
 What use is a computer without all the goodies that accompany it? There are
 literally hundreds of peripherals and network components to choose from in today’s
 fun-filled world of computers. Here, you will learn the basics about the companion
 pieces you will likely encounter in your day-to-day experience.
 All these ports and network components are mainly used to make the experience
 of using a computer easier and more user-friendly. If you want to be an expert in
 networking technology, you should know and understand each component in case
 you have to troubleshoot a problem someday.

 network interface Cards
 Your network interface card (NIC) should be autodetected during setup, but if
 it is not, you must install the driver for the network card. The driver normally is Working with Network Hardware 517


shipped on a CD that comes with the card or system, and you should also be able to
download the driver from the manufacturer’s web site. You must make sure that the
network driver is installed before attempting any network communication activities.

binding Protocols
When you install networking protocols on your system, the protocols are bound, or
linked, to the network card through a feature called bindings. If you install multiple
protocols, each protocol is bound to the network card so that if data leaves the
network card, it could use either protocol that is installed. You can optimize network
performance by changing the binding order, which specifies which protocol should
be used first for communication.

network Connection
Connecting to the Internet with a networked server requires a large amount
of bandwidth to provide connectivity for all users. The amount of bandwidth
determines the number of users that can access your site at once. A fast network
connection enables easy access to your web site, whereas a slow connection
sometimes prohibits users from getting to your web site. If you are on an intranet,
you probably do not have to worry about the amount of bandwidth. A normal
100 Mbps Ethernet network card should be sufficient for typical LAN traffic.
 You will most likely have a router connected to the Internet using a WAN-
type interface. The router will then connect your LAN using an internal network
interface that will connect to a hub, or switch, where all other systems are
connected. This router acts as the device that allows all users on the network
to access the Internet.

network-attached storage
Network-attached storage (NAS) units are standalone devices, usually SCSI, that
have a network interface but no PC. A NAS is a containment unit with a power
supply, cooling fans, one or two SCSI controller cards, and bays to hold the storage
units. The unit usually can be locked to prevent anyone from opening it and
removing its contents. The storage units are typically hard disks, although they may
be CD-ROM units, and are typically used as mass storage for servers to access.
 With CD-ROMs, the unit is usually called a CD tower; it allows you to share the
CDs on the network to provide users with easy access to multiple CDs. CD towers
can hold as many as 32 CD-ROMs at one time for users to access the contents of.
This is typical of CD-ROM libraries used by law firms or in the medical field by
doctors. 518 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 With hard disks, a NAS allows for a large point of mass storage, and it can
 possibly include a built-in RAID controller to allow all the hard disks to be fault
 tolerant and function as a single volume. You manage configuration of a NAS by
 telnetting to the system or connecting to its web page and setting configuration
 options to allow sharing and setting up a unit name. The unit name allows you
 to use the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) to connect to the unit and its
 devices.

 advantages of nas One advantage of using NAS is that the units can be
 placed anywhere. Most of these units are a little larger than a tower PC and can be
 placed under a desk with sufficient ventilation. To add storage units, you don’t need
 to purchase a PC and OS into which to place the required devices, such as the hard
 disks and CD-ROMs. In addition, the units take up less space and can be placed in
 a server room, even on a desk or table, or in another secure area, so you don’t need a
 large amount of space.

 Disadvantages of nas A disadvantage of NAS is that the interface requires
 some knowledge as far as configuration and may require some training to use.
 Administering these units also requires some monitoring to verify that the unit is
 still functioning properly with the proper share names. The administration might
 not be too difficult, but it will cause some overhead. Usually, once it is set up, it
 won’t need further administration unless something goes wrong.

 Network-attached storage units are very useful in a large network
 environment and typically support RAID functions.Typically, clustered
 environments use NAS for the shared data.



 serial Ports
 Serial ports are a slow link that allows data flow with the bits being sent one at a
 time. This is different from a parallel connection, which sends data eight bits at a
 time. A serial link typically transmits information at 128 Kbps. You may find a serial
 link on networking devices such as routers to connect to a WAN interface.

 Serial ports are also known as COM ports, or communication ports. Working with Network Hardware 519


Parallel Ports
Parallel ports yield better performance by sending data eight bits at a time and offer
transfer rates as high as 2 Mbps, depending on the parallel port mode. Printers are
the most popular type of parallel port devices used on networks.

universal serial bus
Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an innovation in computer peripheral technology that
enables you to add devices such as audio players, scanners, printers, network cards,
and external hard drives to your computer without having to add an adapter card or
even having to turn the computer off. USB comes in two flavors right now:

 n USB 1.0 USB 1 has a transfer rate of 12 Mbps, which is an amazing speed,
 considering that serial ports and parallel ports offer only a speed up to 2 Mbps.
 n USB 2.0 USB 2.0 has a transfer rate of 480 Mbps! This difference in
 transfer rate dramatically reduces the time it takes to transfer data from one
 network component to another. For example, last week I was transferring
 a 3GB file from my USB 2.0 drive to the hard drive on the computer, but
 because there was not a USB 2.0 driver loaded, the system was treating the
 device as a USB 1.1 device. As a result, the file copy operation was going to
 take 67 minutes! I chose Cancel and then updated the driver to USB 2.0 and
 attempted the file copy a second time; this time it took 3 minutes. Gotta love
 USB 2.0!

 Most systems today have USB ports on both the front and the back of the
computer. You can also purchase a USB hub device that will connect to your system
and allow additional devices to be connected to it.

small Computer system interface
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a standard interface that enables
systems to communicate with peripheral hardware, such as disk drives, tape drives,
CD-ROM drives, printers, and scanners. What makes SCSI devices so special is the
improvement in data transfer over parallel devices. For example, Ultra-Wide SCSI 2
devices can transfer data up to 80 MBps compared to EIDE, which has a transfer rate
of 16 MBps. Another benefit of SCSI devices is the capability to daisy-chain as many
as 7 or 15 devices (depending on the bus width). SCSI devices are more important for
high-performance systems such as servers than they are for the home PC. 520 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 Print servers
 Print servers can be either dedicated servers that are responsible for sending
 documents to various printer pools scattered around a corporation, or they can
 be used in tandem with file servers. These servers are used to send documents to
 the print device for printing. This system makes much more sense than having a
 separate printer for each computer, and it gives you more control over administering
 the documents that are sent to each network printer.

 bridges
 Bridges are intelligent devices used to filter traffic on LANs by forwarding packets
 to specific network segments based on the source and destination MAC addresses of
 the packet. Bridges have been popular in the past and seem to have been replaced by
 switches on today’s networks.

 Hubs
 Hubs enable you to connect systems together at a central point; they have been
 popular devices on networks for many years. Because hubs send data to all ports on
 the hub, they have been replaced by switches on networks today. A switch only
 sends data to the port where data needs to go, not to all the ports like with a hub.
 The simple filtering features increase overall performance on the network.

 switches
 Switches filter traffic by sending the data only to the port where the data should go,
 essentially not using the bandwidth of the other ports. This is different from a hub,
 which sends the data to all ports no matter what.

 Today’s computer networks are using switches more than hubs because of
 both the performance benefits and the security benefits of switches.



 routers
 Routers route data packets from one network to another network using the network
 address of the packet. Remember the OSI model that you learned about in Chapter 2?
 Routers essentially create broadcast and collision domains and route data destined for a
 particular network. Working with Network Hardware 521


gateways
A gateway can link networks that have different protocols, such as TCP/IP to
IPX/SPX. A gateway can change an entire protocol stack into another or provide
protocol conversion and routing services between computer networks. Gateways
examine the entire packet and then translate the incompatible protocols so that
each network can understand the two different protocols. For example, protocol
gateways can also be used to convert ATM cells to Frame Relay frames and
vice versa.

Peripherals
With today’s booming computer industry, you have many options in choosing
peripherals for your computer. The standard I/O devices, such as keyboard and
mouse, are the mainstays of computer peripherals, but you can choose many other
peripherals to make your PC experience even better. Let’s look at some now.

the Keyboard A keyboard connects to the computer using a PS/2, DIN, or
USB connection, and enables you to input data. Because the keyboard is the primary
input device, you rely on the keyboard more than you realize. The keyboard contains
certain standard function keys, such as the escape key, the tab key, cursor movement
keys, shift keys, and control keys, and sometimes other manufacturer-customized
keys, such as the windows key.

the Mouse A mouse connects to the serial, PS/2, or USB port on your computer
and enables you to move a cursor around the GUI of your desktop operating system
or server.

Print Device A print device outputs data from your computer to paper or other
media, such as labels, transparencies, or envelopes. Sharing print devices is one of
the more popular reasons to have a network, which allows multiple users to access a
single print device.

Digital Camera A digital camera is a fairly popular peripheral these days, which
enables the user to take pictures and store them as files in memory on the camera
instead of film used by conventional cameras. The pictures that are saved as digi-
tal images on a memory card can be printed at a later time or e-mailed to friends,
coworkers, or relatives. 522 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network



 scanners Scanners are used to convert a photo already in print to a digital image
 on the computer. This digital image can then be manipulated after the fact. Scan-
 ners in the past have connected to a parallel port on the system, but today’s scanners
 are connecting to the USB port.

 Modems A modem is a communications device that enables a computer to
 talk to another computer through a standard telephone line. The modem converts
 digital data from the computer to analog data for transmission over analog telephone
 lines. The analog signal is then converted back to digital data by the modem on the
 receiving computer.


Compatibility and Cabling issues
 All network cables are not created equal. There are four different types of commonly
 used network cables: thicknet (10Base5), thinnet (10Base2), twisted pair, and fiber
 optic. For most of your networking needs, twisted pair is the cable of choice because
 it is relatively inexpensive and available. It is also easy to run in tight places, and
 many standards are adopted for its RJ-45 interface.

 incompatibilities with analog Modems and a Digital jack
 An analog modem and a digital jack will not work together, because they use two
 different technologies. An analog modem works over a standard phone line, and a
 digital jack for ISDN works with a digital PBX switch, not an analog phone switch.

 uses of rj-45 Connectors with Different Cabling
 An RJ-45 connector is used to connect segments of twisted-pair cabling. To connect
 two different types of media cable, you need either a hub or bridge that has a specific
 connection for this type of cabling, or you can use a small transceiver device that
 has both connection types on it (essentially a converter). For example, you cannot
 connect a 10BaseT cable that plugs into a bridge that supports connectivity with
 a BNC connector for 10Base2. You must have the correct network hardware to
 connect the two different types of cabling media.

 Patch Cables and Length of Cabling segment
 A CAT 5 patch cable is normally a couple of feet long or however long you need
 to connect the client to the network. Commonly, a patch cable is used to “patch”
 the length it takes to get from your network card to the digital jack on the floor of
 your office. Certification Summary 523


CertifiCation suMMary
 In this chapter you have learned the basic elements that make up a network. You
 have learned that clients connect to servers by using client software. You have also
 learned that each system will need a network card driver installed and a protocol if
 they are to communicate on this network.
 You have learned that each user who will access the network will need to have
 a user account. Users identify themselves to the network by user accounts; these
 are created by the network administrator. You have learned how to create Active
 Directory accounts in Active Directory Users and Computers and to create Linux
 accounts in the Red Hat User Manager.
 It is important that you create a strong password policy for your user accounts
 to ensure that the passwords are difficult for someone to guess or crack. A strong
 password is a password that has a minimum of six characters, has lowercase and
 uppercase characters, and uses symbols or numbers. You may define your password
 policy within the Domain Controller Security Policy on a Domain Controller.
 You have learned that you can organize your users into groups—this will allow
 you to assign permissions more easily because you can assign permissions to the
 groups instead of each user. Windows has two types of groups: a security group
 for permissions and e-mail and a distribution group for just e-mail. You may use
 the Active Directory Users and Computers console to create groups with Active
 Directory, and you may use the Red Hat User Manager to create groups in Linux.
 You have learned how to set NTFS permissions to secure a folder and how to
 share that folder so that users on the network may access the folder. You have
 learned of a number of permissions in NTFS; be sure to review those before the
 exam. You have also learned how to create and share a printer on a Windows Server
 2003 system.
 Finally we have reviewed some of the different types of hardware that you will
 encounter in your travels as a networking professional, and we have discussed issues
 surrounding cabling and interference and compatibility. 524 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network




3 tWo-Minute DriLL
 installing a network
 q Microsoft has three types of servers: standalone, member, and domain controller.
 q A standalone server is not part of a domain and sits on its own. It relies on
 its own security database known as the SAM database for user and group
 management and authentication services.
 q A member server is a member of a domain but does not have the Active
 Directory database installed. A member server typically runs applications
 such as Exchange or SQL Server.
 q A domain controller is a server that holds the Active Directory database.
 q To have communication on a network, you need to have a network client,
 protocol, and network card driver installed.

 Creating user accounts
 q There are two types of accounts: built-in and administrator-created.
 q Built-in accounts are accounts that are created during the installation of the
 operating system. There is typically an administrative account built in to the
 operating system and a guest account that is disabled by default.
 q The built-in administrative account in Windows is called Administrator, and
 the one built into Linux/UNIX is called root.
 q You can create a user account in Active Directory with the Active Directory
 Users and Computers console.
 q You may create a user account in Linux with the Red Hat User Manager.
 q You should create a password policy that enforces strong passwords.
 q A strong password consists of upper and lowercase characters and has a
 minimum of six characters and a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

 Managing groups
 q Groups are used to organize users into administrative units.
 q There are built-in groups in Windows such as Administrators, Backup
 Operators, Account Operators, and Print Operators.
 q Backup Operators can perform backups, Printer Operators can install and
 configure printers, and Account Operators can create and manage user accounts. Two-Minute Drill 525


 q Global groups are used to organize users within a domain, domain local
 groups are used for permissions or rights assignment, and universal groups are
 used to organize users across domains.
 q Security groups are used for security or e-mail, and distribution groups are
 used only for e-mail.

securing files and folders
 q Use NTFS partitions so that you can configure NTFS permissions on folders.
 q Use share permissions when creating the shared resource.
 q When NTFS and share permissions conflict—the most restrictive wins.
 q In Linux, you can configure permissions with the chmod command.
 q The Full Control permission allows a user to modify the file contents and
 modify permissions, while the Modify permission only allows a user to modify
 the file contents—not permissions.
 q You can connect to a folder with a UNC path. The UNC path has the
 following syntax: computernamesharename.

installing Printers
 q Microsoft terms the print device as the machine that holds the paper and ink
 and prints the content on paper, whereas the printer is the software interface
 to the print device.
 q A print server is a machine that has a shared printer and receives print
 requests from clients.
 q A printer (or queue in other network environments) is where the print job is
 stored while trying to print.

Working with network Hardware
 q Because computers are affected by temperature, moisture, vibrations, and
 electrical interference, you need to create a controlled environment and be in
 control of each of these elements.
 q Watch cable distance on the different cable types and be familiar with the
 components that can create interference in your environment.
 q Network-attached storage (NAS) is a popular choice for mass storage devices
 such as RAID drives and CD-ROMs. 526 Chapter 10: Implementing a Network

 I nstalling and setting up the network is only the beginning of your job as a network
 professional.You are going to be required to maintain the network by performing some
 very common day-to-day tasks, such as updating the operating system with any new security
 patches and installing and maintaining antivirus software to protect your systems against virus attacks.

 This chapter looks at these essential tasks along with other common critical tasks,
 such as backing up data and installing antispyware software. Each task is critical to
 the day-to-day maintenance of the network!

network Upgrades
 Before we discuss performing operating system upgrades, let’s look at software and
 hardware upgrades and some best practices for dealing with these upgrades. It is
 important to be sure that before applying any software upgrade and hardware upgrade,
 you read as much documentation about the upgrade and configure a test environment
 to test the upgrade. Never perform an upgrade for the first time on production systems.

software Upgrades
 Software manufacturers release upgrades for their products to improve them and make
 them more powerful. You should always install an upgrade on a standalone machine
 before distributing it to the network. This enables you to test the application and go
 through the upgrade process in a nonproduction environment.
 Many minor upgrades are free and require a simple download similar to a patch.
 Upgrading from one version of an application or OS to another usually requires the
 purchaser to pay a fee for the new product. Sometimes an application can have a
 minor version change, such as version 5.01 to version 5.02, which may not require a
 fee, due to the subtle changes contained in the upgrade. Other upgrades, meanwhile,
 can be ordered for free from the manufacturer, or may come at a minimal cost if you
 are a registered owner of the older version. Again, be sure to have a good backup
 before you install the upgrade in order to prevent data loss.

 Be sure to have a test lab for any software or hardware upgrades so that
 you can thoroughly test the new changes with all of your existing hardware
 and software. Be sure that the upgrade has not caused another aspect of the
 network, including applications on the users’ desktops, to stop working. Network Upgrades 535


Hardware Upgrades
 Not only will you be responsible for replacing old devices with new ones, such
 as an old 10 Mbps hub with a new 10/100 Mbps network switch, you will also be
 responsible for updating the firmware that is contained in your servers and network
 devices. The firmware is a special type of ROM chip that controls the functionality
 of the server or device; it is updated using a special software program called a ROM
 update, or a flash program. It is recommended that you keep informed about the
 latest ROM updates for all the components on your network. If there is an update,
 there is a reason for it, and if you can avoid the problem before it happens, you’ll
 save yourself a lot of headaches. Make sure that you have the correct update and
 that you have done sufficient research into what the update does.
 Manufacturers of hardware devote an area on their web sites to their hardware
 products and allow you to download the latest firmware so that you can update
 the components in your servers, routers, switches, and workstations. Figure 11-1
 shows how to download the latest BIOS updates from the Dell site for a PowerEdge
 1800 server.

 When downloading BIOS updates, be sure that you have the correct and most
 recent version. On this Dell site, you can see in Figure 11-2 that the site shows
 the most recent version of the BIOS for this PowerEdge 1800 but also contains a
 link to view the previous versions. If you click the link for the current version, it
 will take you to a description of that version and to the file download you will be
 required to apply to the server.
 If you click the link for the current BIOS update for the Dell PowerEdge 1800,
 you will see the description and download link of the BIOS update as shown in
 Figure 11-3. Notice in the figure that you can see the release date of the BIOS at the
 top of the screen, and then at the bottom of the screen you can see the link for the
 file that needs to be downloaded. Along with the file link, they specify a description
 on what you will need to do with this file. In most cases, you will download the
 executable and then either run the update on the system directly or burn to CD and
 then boot off the CD to perform the update. It is important to make sure that you
 read the directions first, because each vendor applies the update differently.

 Some hardware items may not allow for ROM updates, and those that do may
 require a full hardware upgrade to meet the needs of the company. For example,
 if a company upgrades its network from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps Ethernet and the
 company had purchased only 10 Mbps Ethernet cards, there won’t be a way to just
 update the ROM to allow for 100 Mbps transfer speeds. That would require a full
 hardware replacement of the network card.
 When new hardware is purchased, you must verify that the hardware will work
 with your existing PCs, as well as the OSs and the network environment.

 Be aware of how to perform a ROM BIOS flash upgrade. Remember that the
 power cannot be shut off during the upgrade, or else the BIOS will be corrupt
 and the system will not function. Also remember that after the upgrade is
 complete, the system must be shut off and turned back on for the changes to
 take effect. 538 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network

installing Patches and Updates
 The applications and operating systems that are installed on our computers are
 developed by people like you and me and will most likely have mistakes programmed
 into them along with the great features of the application that we see every day.
 These mistakes (known as vulnerabilities) that are left in the program code can be
 found by individuals who then take over your system or network by exploiting that
 vulnerability! This is known as a network attack, or system attack, depending on
 whether the entire network was taken over or just a single system.
 A number of network attacks can be prevented because the manufacturers of the
 software and operating systems are always looking for the vulnerabilities in their
 code. They then fix those mistakes and ship the fixes in what is known as a fix or
 update. You will normally acquire these fixes and updates through the manufacturer’s
 web site. For example, Microsoft operating systems have a Windows Update program
 item in the Start menu to go to the company’s update web site and scan your system
 for any updates that need to be installed. This feature is known as Windows Update
 and may be run from choosing Start | All Programs | Windows Update, as shown
 in Figure 11-4. After Windows Update determines the updates, or fixes, that are
 needed on your system, your system will download the updates from the Windows
 Update site.
 There are various types of updates that will be delivered to you through the
 Windows Update site. They are listed as follows:

 n Security hot-fix A security hot-fix is a critical security update that should
 be applied to your system as quickly as possible because the vulnerability
 opens the system to serious security risks.
 n Patch A patch is a fix to a particular problem in software or operating
 system code that does not create a security risk but does create problems with
 the system or the application.
 n Service pack A service pack is all updates for a product, including patches
 and security hot-fixes, from the time the product was released up to the time
 of the service pack. If you install a service pack, you will not need to install
 each patch individually, because the service pack includes all updates up to
 that point in time. You will need to install patches and security fixes that
 come out after the service pack. Installing Patches and Updates 539

Starting the
Windows Update
on a Windows
server




 Consider now Exercise 11-1, which demonstrates how to patch a system with
 Windows Update.


 exerCise 11-1

Patching a system with Windows Update
 In this exercise you will run Windows Update to bring your Windows Server system
 up-to-date in order to help protect the system from known vulnerabilities. Windows
 2000 Server is used in this example because there are a number of exploits against it.
 The point of the exercise is to show you that once the system is patched the exploit
 no longer works.
 Before patching the system you will first download and leverage an RPC exploit
 known as kaht2 that will allow you to connect to the Windows 2000 Server as 540 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 the operating system account and take full control of the unpatched system. After
 verifying that you could connect to the unpatched system, you will then patch the
 server by running Windows Update and trying the exploit again—the second time
 you will be unsuccessful because the system has been patched. Please note that it is
 illegal to gain unauthorized access to another system, network, or device—this lab is for
 educational purposes only and is designed to show the importance of patching a system.

 Compromising an Unpatched system

 1. On your Windows XP system, download the kaht2.zip file from http://www.
 securityfocus.com/bid/8205/exploit (as shown in the following illustration).
 Once you have downloaded the Zip file, extract it to c:labfilestoolskaht2.




 2. Click Start | Run and then type cmd.
 3. Choose OK. Installing Patches and Updates 541


4. At the command prompt, type cd c:labfilestoolskaht2.
5. You will now use two IP addresses with the kaht command-line utility.
 Address 1 will be the IP address that is one less than the address of your
 unpatched Windows 2000 Server, whereas address 2 is the IP address of
 your Windows 2000 Server. Once you know these two addresses, type kaht2&lt;address1&gt;&lt;address2&gt;(as shown in the following illustration) and press
 enter. In my example I intend on hitting the 192.168.1.201 system so I will
 type kaht2 192.168.1.200 192.168.1.201.




6. If you are connected to the server, you will be sitting at the prompt of
 c:winntsystem32—which is the C:drive of the server you have just
 compromised! If your screen looks like the screen shown in the illustration
 that follows, you will need to patch the Windows 2000 Server. 542 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 7. To verify that you are connected as the system account and can create your
 own user account on the server, type net user bobby password /add. To place
 this newly created user account in the administrators group of the server,
 type net localgroup administrators bobby /add. The results are shown in the
 illustration that follows.




 8. You have proven that you can take control of an unpatched system by
 creating your own administrative account. Type Exit to exit out of the
 kaht2 shell.
 9. Type Exit to exit out of the command window.

 Patching the system with Windows Update
 10. To protect the server from the kaht attack, you need to make sure that you
 patch the server. Microsoft is aware of the vulnerability, and the vulnerability
 will be fixed if you perform a full Windows update on the system. On the
 Windows 2000 Server select Start | Windows Update (as shown in the top
 illustration on the next page).
 11. The Windows Update site is loaded in the browser. Click the Scan For
 Updates link. Installing Patches and Updates 543




12. Windows scans for updates for your system (as shown in the following
 illustration). 544 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 13. Click the Review And Install Updates link and you will be presented with a
 screen like the one in the illustration that follows.




 14. In the foregoing screen, you will notice on the left side that there are eight
 critical updates and five updates for Windows 2000 that are not considered
 critical. Review the list of updates on the right side of the screen. To install
 the updates, click the Install button on the right side of the screen. This
 will take some time, and you may have to reboot your system a few times,
 depending on what is installed. After each reboot, you will need to restart
 Windows Update through the Start button. You may get asked questions
 during the install, such as to agree to the license agreement, and you can
 click Next on any of the installation screens and accept all defaults for the
 installation of any of the updates. Installing Patches and Updates 545


 trying to exploit a Patched system
 15. Once the update of the system is complete, let’s verify that the patching
 of the system prevents the RPC exploit from happening again. Go to
 your Windows XP Professional system and type kaht2 192.168.1.200
 192.168.1.201—you should be unsuccessful with this attack (as shown in
 the following illustration).




Windows server Update services (WsUs)
 Running Windows Update on one system is no problem, but what if you have to
 manage 500 systems and ensure that each system is up-to-date with current patches
 and hot-fixes? Microsoft has created Windows Server Update Services (WSUS),
 which allows you to create a WSUS server and download the updates from the
 Internet to the WSUS server. You can then test the installation of those updates to
 some test systems to verify that the updates do not conflict with any applications on
 the systems; then you can send the update out to the 500 systems.
 When you send the updates to the 500 systems on the network, you can do it from
 a central point—the WSUS server. The WSUS server has a web-based management
 tool that allows you to manually approve updates. Those updates are downloaded to
 the WSUS server. Within WSUS you can create groups of computers and then send
 the updates out to the different groups on the network. An update that you have not
 approved will not be sent to the systems on the network. Figure shows a WSUS
 structure. 546 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network

 There are many benefits to a product like WSUS; for one thing, you can
 download the updates to one central machine from the Internet instead of having
 each system downloading from the Internet. This helps to maintain available
 bandwidth by not having each person perform the download. Another benefit
 to WSUS is that clients are receiving only updates that you have approved. This
 happens because you will configure each client to retrieve the updates from the
 WSUS server and not the Internet. Once you have approved the update on the
 WSUS server, the client will get the update automatically through WSUS. Any
 updates that are not approved will not be downloaded by the clients on the network.
 It is also important to note that with WSUS the installation is performed by the
 system itself, not the user who has logged on. This is important because users
 typically do not have privileges to install software. Figure 11-6 displays the WSUS
 administration site. Installing Patches and Updates 547

WSUS is used to
distribute updates
from a central
server.




 You can download a free copy of WSUS by going to the www.microsoft.com/
 download site. Once you download the program, you will need to install it on a
 Windows server running IIS. After installing WSUS and downloading the updates
 from the Microsoft site, you then need to approve the updates. After approving
 the updates, the next step is to configure the clients to point to the WSUS server
 so that they download the updates from the WSUS server instead of the Windows
 Update site.

 Configuring Clients to Use the WsUs server for Updates
 To configure the Windows clients on your network to use the WSUS server, you
 will configure a domain policy that configures each client in the domain to point to
 the WSUS server for the updates. If you are not in a domain environment, you may 548 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 configure the clients through local policies. To change the default domain policy on
 the network, follow these steps:

 1. Click Start | Administrative Tools | Active Directory Users And
 Computers.
 2. Once in Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the domain at
 the top-left corner and choose Properties. In my example, the domain is
 glensworld.loc (as shown in the following illustration).




 3. Once the properties of the domain are displayed, click the Group Policy tab.
 4. Make sure that the Default Domain Policy is selected and click Edit.
 5. The Group Policy Object Editor appears. In the Computer Configuration
 section expand Administrative Templates | Windows Components and then
 highlight Windows Update (as shown in the top illustration on the next page).
 6. To enable automatic updates on the clients in your domain, double-click
 Configure Automatic Updates. Installing Patches and Updates 549




 7. In the Configure Automatic Updates Properties, select Enable, choose Auto
 Download, and schedule the Install option. Specify a schedule of 3:00 a.m. for
 the automatic installation.
 8. Click OK.
 9. Double-click the “Specify Intranet Microsoft update service location” policy
 and enable the policy setting. Set your Intranet server to the name of the
 server that you installed WSUS on. For example, my server was called
 win2003, so the Intranet server address is http://win2003.
 10. Close the Group Policy Object Editor window.
 11. Click OK.
 12. Close Active Directory Users and Computers.

 Now that the policy is configured in Active Directory, the clients will automatically
point to your WSUS server and install any updates that you approve in the WSUS
administration site. 550 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network

antivirus and antispyware software
 Making sure that the systems are up-to-date with software and operating system
 patches is only part of your job as a network professional. It is extremely critical that,
 given today’s threats that come through e-mail systems and the Internet, you have
 an antivirus policy in place that specifies that all systems, including both clients and
 servers, have antivirus software installed and configured properly. This section will
 introduce you to the differences between viruses and spyware and demonstrate how
 to configure applications to protect you from malicious software.


antivirus software
 A virus is malicious software that is installed on the system, usually by accident or
 through trickery, which does harm to the system and affects its normal operation.
 Viruses in the past have been known to prevent the computer from starting up and
 to use features like the address book in the e-mail program to send e-mail to all
 recipients in the address book. Bottom line—as a network professional you need to
 be familiar with installing antivirus software and how to keep it up-to-date.

 Antivirus software can be installed on systems automatically through software
 deployment features such as Group Policies in Active Directory or Zenworks in
 Novell environments.

 There are a number of antivirus software products, the most popular of which
 appear in the following list:

 n Norton AntiVirus
 n McAfee Antivirus
 n Panda Antivirus
 n FProt Antivirus
 n AVG Antivirus Antivirus and Antispyware Software 551


 Each antivirus product offers pretty much the same type of functionality. Some of
 the features offered by antivirus products include

 n Scheduled scans Each product should offer a scheduling feature that
 allows you to schedule a virus scan. A virus scan is what the virus protection
 software does—it scans the system to see whether the system has been
 infected with a computer virus.
 n Scheduled definition updates The virus protection software should allow
 the scheduling of a virus definition update. A virus definition is a list of all
 known viruses at the time the definition file was created. After you install
 the antivirus software, make sure that you are updating the virus definitions
 on a regular basis; this will ensure that your system is always being protected
 from the most current viruses. Figure 11-7 shows the option to update your
 antivirus definitions in Norton AntiVirus.
 n Real-time protection Most antivirus products offer real-time protection,
 which is a feature that scans any file that you access—as you access it. This
 is an automatic feature—once it is enabled, you will not need to manually
 invoke the scan on a file before opening the file. Figure 11-8 shows the
 enabling and disabling of real-time protection. In Figure 11-8 notice that you
 can enable the real-time protection features but also specify what action the
 software should take when a virus is found. In this example, Norton will try
 to clean the virus (remove it); if that is not successful, it will quarantine the
 virus. You can also specify whether you want to see a message on the system
 and what file types are being protected.

 n E-mail features A number of antivirus products integrate with your e-mail
 software so that it scans the contents of your e-mail and helps to protect your
 system from a virus that is received through e-mail. There are also server-class
 antivirus products that you can load on the e-mail server so that the server
 scans the e-mail before depositing the e-mail in the user’s mailbox. You most
 definitely want to load a server-based antivirus product on your e-mail server.
 Figure 11-9 shows a version of Norton AntiVirus that will scan e-mails going
 to your Exchange Server.

 years. They are most often loaded on your system when you surf a malicious or
 hacked web site.
 Antispyware (and -adware) is software that you can use to remove these
 troublesome invaders from your system. There are a number of products that
 can be used to remove this malicious software, such as Spybot, Ad-Aware, and
 Microsoft’s Windows Defender. Antispyware has become as popular as antivirus
 software, and a lot of features in newer antispyware products are the same as
 those on antivirus software, such as real-time protection and scheduling of scans.
 Figure 11-10 shows Microsoft’s antispyware software known as Windows Defender,
 which includes such features as

 n Real-time protection
 n Scheduled scans
 n Browser hijack protection
 n Automatic updates of malicious software definitions

 Additionally, you can view software that is running in memory with the Software

backing Up network Data
 A critical task to help maintain the network and ensure that users have access to
 their data is to regularly back up data on the network to another location. You may
 back up the data to tape drives or to a backup file on another server, although tape
 drives are the more popular solution.


tape Drives
 The two most common types of tape drives are digital audio tape (DAT) and digital
 linear tape (DLT). This section looks at each drive in some detail. The exam will
 not delve into as many particulars, but understanding their characteristics will help
 you remember the information about the drives and ultimately help you on the test. Backing Up Network Data 555


 Digital audio tape (Dat)
 Digital audio tape (DAT) was developed in the mid-1980s by Sony and Philips to
 record music in a digital format, but it has now become very popular as a medium
 for computer data storage. The DAT drive uses a helical scan, which means that the
 read/write heads spin diagonally across the tape. DAT uses the digital data storage
 (DDS) format and a 4 mm tape. Although the speed isn’t as good as that of a DLT
 drive, the capacity can be quite large. Different DDS formats allow for different
 amounts of storage on a tape. Table 11-1 lists different DDS formats and their
 storage capacities.
 As DDS-1 emerged, so did compression. That is why you’ll notice that formats
 from DDS-1 to DDS-3 have a second number associated with them, which is always
 double the base storage capacity. Using this equation, standard 4 mm tapes for DAT
 drives can hold up to 24GB of data. Other technologies have also emerged with
 the appearance of 8 mm tapes, but you won’t need to know these for the exam.
 Figure 11-11 shows a DAT tape drive.

 DDS-2 4–8GB
 DDS-3 12–24GB



 figUre 11-11

A DAT tape drive 556 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 Digital linear tape (Dlt)
 Digital linear tape (DLT) was introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation in the
 mid-1980s, but Quantum Corporation owns the technology now. The DLT tape is a
 half-inch reel-to-reel magnetic tape, where the tape cartridge contains one reel and
 the DLT drive the other. The main advantages are fast data transfer rates, higher
 storage capacity, and higher reliability over DAT. All this, of course, comes at a price
 to the customer.
 DLT drives store data on the tape differently than DAT drives do. The data path
 is made up of parallel tracks recorded in a serpentine pattern. What this means is
 that the first track is written from one end of the tape to the other and then the
 heads are repositioned and the next track goes the opposite direction (again for the
 entire length of the tape). The drive continues to go back and forth, writing until
 the tape is full.


tape rotation
 When it comes to maintaining the network, you need to schedule a backup job and
 develop a backup schedule. Many companies do a tape rotation. They have daily,
 weekly, and monthly tapes, the rotation of which usually consists of 20 to 25 tapes,
 each with its purpose. Sometimes this is called an autopilot rotation. The backup
 software keeps a database and expects a certain tape on each day of the year. The
 most common is a 21-tape rotation consisting of 4 daily tapes for Monday through
 Thursday, 5 weekly tapes for each Friday (some months have 5 Fridays), and 12
 monthly tapes for the last weekday of the month. There are no backups on Saturday
 or Sunday. It is a good idea to store the weekly or monthly tapes offsite to keep fire
 or some major catastrophic event from ruining your data and your backups.
 Offsite storage of tape backups is a critical part of your backup plan. If you have a
 fire in the office and it destroys your servers and tape backups, there wouldn’t have
 been much point in having the backup at all. Make sure that copies of backups are
 stored offsite.
 Along with tape rotations come tape libraries and tape arrays. Tape libraries
 are designed to contain a series of tapes in a holder that is inserted into the tape
 mechanism to automate the rotation of tapes throughout the week. If the amount
 of data is very large, the tape library may be used on a daily basis to rotate multiple
 tapes in and out of the various drives to make sure all data fits onto a tape. Tape
 arrays, on the other hand, are similar to RAID technology with hard drives, wherein Backing Up Network Data 557


 data is spread over a series of drives—for instance, there might be a parity drive to
 add fault tolerance. Manufacturers claim that tape arrays increase the throughput
 because multiple drives are writing simultaneously.

 It is extremely critical that you store copies of the backup offsite in case there
 is a disaster, such as fire or flooding in your building. If servers and backups are
 stored in the same location, the organization will be vulnerable to data loss.



full, incremental, and Differential backups
 Backup software enables you to run three types of backups: full, incremental, and
 differential. These are the three you may see on the exam, so we will focus on
 them. The key to backing up data is to ensure that you can restore it in the event
 of a system failure. These three types of backup will function well if you use them
 together correctly.

 full backup
 A full backup backs up every file on the specified volume or volumes (or partitions).
 Many companies run a full backup every day, no matter what. Under such a system,
 the restore process requires only the most recent tape. However, a full backup
 necessitates a large storage capacity and a lot of time. If you have large amounts of
 data, running a daily full backup may not be practical because it may take too long
 to perform.
 Every file has an archive bit that flags
 whether or not the file needs to be backed
 up. When you change a file, this bit is flagged
 automatically, which means that the file needs
 Full backups back up to be backed up. In theory, any file that has
 every file that is selected and then clear been changed needs to backed up because we

 its most recent state.
 To view the archive bit in Windows, right-
 click the file and go to the properties. Once in the properties, click the Advanced
 button on the General tab. You will see the option that says File Is Ready For
 Archiving as shown in Figure 11-12. 558 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network




 figUre 11-12

Looking at the
archive bit in
Windows




 The important thing to understand when a full backup is performed is that the
 backup backs up all the files that you select (whether the archive bit is set or not),
 and then clears the archive bit so that the operating system and applications know
 that the file has been backed up.

 incremental backup
 An incremental backup backs up the files that have changed or were added since
 the last incremental or full backup. It does this by backing only files that have the
 archive bit set (meaning the file needs to be backed up). This is different from a full
 backup, in that a full backup will back up any file that is selected because it does
 not use the archive bit to determine whether
 to back the file up or not—it simply backs up
 whatever you tell it to. An incremental backup

 An incremental backup clears the archive bit to report that the file has been

 the same file would not get backed up (unless it was changed) because the archive

 the full backup and then each incremental backup since the full backup. This will
 ensure that you get the build-up of changes since the full backup.

 you restore multiple incremental backups). Differential backups take more time to
 back up but less time to restore.
 If you decide to take a simpler approach by performing full backups each time,
 you can restore from the most recent full backup and get all the files restored in
 one session.


scheduling backups
 Most network administrators would rather be at home late at night while the backup
 operation is being performed. That’s why they schedule the backup operation so
 that they don’t need to be in the office at night to start the backup after everyone
 else has gone home. Most backup software supports the scheduling of the backup
 operation, and that is definitely one of the features that you would look for in your
 backup software.
 When scheduling your backup operations, you will need to create a backup
 plan. A backup plan will contain a listing of the data that will be backed up with
 each backup operation along with the type of backup that occurs (incremental,
 differential, or full). You should also make sure that the backup schedule is included
 in this plan.
 For example, you may decide that every Saturday morning at 12 a.m. you will
 perform a full backup of your data files and your e-mail data. It is really common to
 have in this backup plan an incremental backup of the same data files and e-mail
 servers that will be scheduled every morning at 12 a.m. To restore any data that goes
 corrupt, you would restore the last full backup and then apply on top of that the
 last differential backup. This will bring your data up-to-date to the point of the last
 differential.
 When developing your backup plan, you should have a detailed plan of what
 resources on the server (such as folders, databases, or mail stores) will be backed
 up and what they contain. You should also plot how often these items need to
 be backed up. This backup plan will serve as great documentation to go in your
 “Network Documentation” book in which you keep a collection of network
 diagrams, firewall rules, server configurations, and the like.

Providing fault tolerance
 Having a data backup is a great idea, and storing a copy of that backup offsite is a
 better idea to help ensure that you can recover from any type of disaster. One of the
 problems with relying only on a backup solution is that if a drive fails on the server,
 users will need to wait for you to replace the drive and then restore all the data—this
 could take hours, depending on the amount of data you are restoring.
 To avoid having to replace the drive and restore the data in the middle of the
 day during business hours, you could take advantage of fault-tolerant solutions
 such as Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). RAID is a technology
 that duplicates data across drives so that if a drive fails, the other drives in the
 solution can provide the data. The benefit is that if a drive fails, you can wait to fix
 the problem at the end of the business day, knowing that the redundancy of your
 solution will take care of the missing data.
 There are different types of RAID, known as levels, and each level provides
 a different benefit with a different type of redundancy. The following subsection
 gives a description of popular RAID levels supported by different network operating
 systems.


raiD level 0
 RAID level 0 is called striping or striped volumes. With RAID 0 multiple disks are
 used to create a volume; when data is saved to the volume, the data is split up and
 spread across all disks in the volume. The benefit of striped volumes is that all disks
 are written to at the same time, giving you a performance benefit. For example, if
 you are saving a 12MB file to drive D and drive D is a striped volume made up of
 four disks, we can generalize the save operation by saying that each disk will save
 3MB of data each and all disks will work at the same time to do the save operation
 that totals 12MB. If you only had one disk working for that 12MB save operation, it
 would take four times longer.
 The disadvantage of RAID level 0 is that there is actually no duplication of data;
 therefore, if one of your hard drives fails within the volume, you can’t read any of the
 data. RAID 0 is strictly for the performance benefit in the read and write operations.

 Configuring raiD 0 on a Windows server
 Windows Server offers a software RAID feature, which means that the operating system
 is responsible for the creation and management of the RAID volume. A hardware RAID
 solution would offer a better-performing solution, but it would be more expensive.
 Before you can start creating fault-tolerant volumes, you must be sure to upgrade
 your disk to a dynamic disk. Dynamic disk is the disk type used in Windows to create
 RAID volumes. Take the following steps to convert your disk from a basic disk (which
 does not support volumes) to a dynamic disk and then create a RAID 0 volume.

 1. Right-click My Computer and choose Manage.
 2. In the Computer Management console, select Disk Management on the left-
 hand side.
 3. Right-click your disk on the right side and choose Upgrade To Dynamic Disk
 (see the accompanying illustration). 568 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 4. The Upgrade To Dynamic Disk dialog box appears, asking you to select
 which disk you want to make dynamic. Select all disks that you wish to
 convert to dynamic disk.
 5. Click OK.
 6. Click Upgrade.
 7. Click Yes.
 8. Click Yes again.
 9. Click OK. You will need to reboot the system.
 10. After the system has rebooted, log on as an administrative account, choose
 No to restarting again, and then start Disk Management.
 11. Right-click an area of unallocated space on disk 1 and choose Create Volume
 (see the accompanying illustration).




 12. The Create Volume Wizard appears. Click Next.
 13. Choose the volume type of Striped Volume (see the accompanying
 illustration), which is the volume type you want to create, and choose Next. Providing Fault Tolerance 569




14. You will now need to choose the disks that will participate in the striped
 volume solution. Select disks 2 and 3 on the left and click Add to add to the
 striped volume (see the accompanying illustration). Notice that the disk you
 started the volume on was already selected as a member of the volume. Since
 I started the volume on disk 1 and added disk 2 and disk 3, I will have three
 disks in this solution. 570 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 15. Once you have added each disk, at the bottom of the dialog box type the
 amount of space you want to use on each disk for the volume. Type 200 and
 notice that each disk will use 200MB—for a total of 600MB for the entire
 volume.
 16. Click Next.
 17. Assign a drive letter of S for Striped.
 18. Click Next.
 19. Click Next to format for NTFS.
 20. Click Finish and the new Striped Volume will be created. Notice that drive S

 at the same time, decreasing the time it




raiD level 1
 RAID level 1 is known as disk mirroring. Disk mirroring uses two hard drives and
 duplicates the data from one drive to another. The fact that RAID 1 does store a
 second copy of the data on another member of the volume means that this solution
 does offer fault tolerance. Fault tolerance is the concept that if one part of the
 solution fails, the other guy will pick up the workload and the solution will continue
 to function.
 If one of the disks in the mirror fails, you can replace the failed disk by breaking
 the mirror, adding a new functioning disk, and then rebuilding the mirror from the
 existing disk that did not fail. Once you have reestablished the mirror, you have your
 fault tolerance back.
 Figure 11-14 displays the concept of a mirror volume. When a user saves data to a
 mirrored volume, the data is written to both disks that make up the volume.

 Creating a Mirrored volume in Windows server
 In this step-by-step you will create a mirrored volume on a Windows server using
 two of the dynamic disks created in the preceding walkthrough. Remember that
 a mirrored volume stores all the data on both members (disks) in the volume. To
 create a mirrored volume, follow these steps:

 1. Right-click My Computer and choose Manage.
 2. Right-click an area of unallocated space on disk 1 and choose Create Volume.
 3. The Create Volume Wizard appears. Click Next.
 4. Choose the volume type of Mirrored Volume, which is the volume type you
 wish to create, and choose Next.




 5. Add disk 2 as a selected disk for the mirrored volume and type 200 MB as the
 total amount of space used on each disk. Also notice that the total space used
 by the volume is 200MB as well. Although there is 200MB per disk, you can
 store only 200MB—the other 200MB is to store a copy of the data in case of
 disaster.
 6. Click Next. Providing Fault Tolerance 573




7. Assign drive M as the drive letter and choose Next.
8. Choose Next to format for NTFS.
9. Choose Finish. The mirrored volume is created. Notice that the legend in
 disk management displays the color codes for each volume type. 574 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 RAID 1 is known as disk mirroring whereby the data is duplicated across two
 different disks but using only one disk controller. When using two disk controllers,
 one with each a hard disk connected to it, we term the RAID 1 solution disk
 duplexing rather than disk mirroring. Figure 11-15 shows the difference between
 disk mirroring and disk duplexing. They are both considered RAID level 1.




 RAID 1 is known as disk copy of the data, on a second disk in case

raiD 5
 RAID level 5 is also known as striping with parity because a RAID 5 volume acts
 as a RAID 0 volume but adds the parity information to create redundancy. RAID
 5 volumes write data to all disks in the volume but store redundant information
 on one of the disks per stripe (a stripe is a row made up of 64KB chunks on each
 disk, as shown in Figure 11-16). For example, when you save data to a RAID 5
 volume made up of four disks, the data is split up into 64KB data chunks (that may
 change, depending on the product or implementation) and written to each disk
 (let’s say disks 0, 1, and 2). But disk 3 will store redundant data (parity data) of the

 three 64KB blocks that have been saved already. If the three 64KB blocks are not
 sufficient to complete saving the file, the save operation will continue onto the next
 row. There will be parity information for that row as well, but the parity information
 is stored on a different disk for each row.

 Creating a raiD 5 volume with Windows server
 In the following walk-through you will see how to create a RAID 5 volume on a
 Windows server using three drives. Remember that a RAID 5 volume is similar to a
 striped volume but also stores redundant information for each stripe that is written.

 1. Right-click My Computer and choose Manage.
 2. Right-click an area of unallocated space on disk 1 and choose Create Volume.
 3. The Create Volume Wizard appears. Click Next.
 4. Choose the volume type of RAID-5 Volume (see the next illustration),
 which is the volume type you wish to create, and choose Next. 576 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 5. You will now need to choose the disks that will participate in the striped
 volume solution. Select disks 2 and 3 on the left and click Add to add to the
 striped volume (see the next illustration). Notice that the disk you started
 the volume on was already selected as a member of the volume. Because I
 started the volume on disk 1 and added disk 2 and disk 3, I will have three
 disks in this solution.




 6. Once you have added each disk, at the bottom of the dialog box type the amount
 of space you want to use on each disk for the volume. Type 200 and notice that
 each disk will use 200MB—for a total of 400MB for the entire volume, because a
 third of the space is used for parity and is not actual usable space.
 7. Click Next.
 8. Assign a drive letter R for RAID-5 Volume.
 9. Click Next.
 10. Click Next to format for NTFS.
 11. Click Finish; the new RAID-5 Volume has been created (see the next
 illustration). Notice that drive R shows multiple times because it is made up
 of multiple disks. Providing Fault Tolerance 577




 12. Close all windows.

 If one of the disks fails, with a RAID 5 volume you can still access the data but
 you may want to replace the faulty disk. To recover from a disk error with RAID 5,
 you simply replace the failed disk and regenerate the volume so that the data on the
 failed disk is created on the newly added disk.

network Documentation
 One of the duties that is overlooked by most network professionals is the task of
 creating network documentation and maintaining that documentation. This section
 will outline different types of network documentation you should maintain.


Wiring schematics
 One of the hardest tasks to perform is to clean up or rewire the wiring closet because
 most administrators do not document or label the purpose of each switch, router, or
 cable in the wiring closet.
 It is important to keep a wiring diagram that outlines how all aspects of the
 network are connected. You want to be sure to document and label the purpose of
 each device such as switches and routers. For example, a number of companies will
 assign specific switches to specific departments or divisions within the company, so
 the purpose of those switches should be labeled and documented so that the wrong
 network cable does not get plugged into the switch.
 Be sure to label and document the purpose of each wire or at least group the
 related wires and then document their purpose.


Physical network Diagram
 The physical network diagram will document the physical network infrastructure
 including the placement of switches, routers, servers, and workstations. The physical
 network diagram will display items such as WAN links and the speeds of these links.
 A great piece of software to help create the network diagrams is Microsoft Visio.
 Visio has a number of graphical objects built in that represent routers, switches,
 and network links. You can create your network diagram with Visio and label each
 device and network link. Be sure to include information such as the make and model
 of the device.


logical network Diagram
 The logical network diagram should be documented. This includes aspects such as IP
 address ranges used on different network segments and WAN links. Network Documentation 579


 In the logical network diagram you should also document any VLANs that are
 being used on the network and which computers belong to which VLANs.
 The logical network diagram should also include the structure of your directory
 service, such as the Active Directory Domains and the OU structure.


baselines
 At some point you will end up troubleshooting performance problems with the
 network and the servers. When troubleshooting performance problems, you
 will use performance monitoring tools (to monitor the systems) and network
 monitoring tools (to monitor the network). It is critical after the installation of
 the network that you use these tools to create a baseline. The baseline is a picture
 of what your systems and network look like, from a performance point of view,
 when life is normal.
 Once you have saved and documented normal activity in a baseline, you can then
 refer to the baseline when troubleshooting performance issues later on down the
 road. What you will end up doing when there is a problem is to use the monitoring
 tools again to capture activity on the poorly performing system or network and then
 compare the capture to the information in the baseline to find out what the problem
 is. It would be really hard to determine what areas of the network are degrading
 without a baseline to refer to.


Policies and Procedures
 When documenting aspects of the network, you want to be sure to document any
 network policy details. There are a wide range of network policies that you want to
 be sure to document:

 n Password policy The password policy will determine what are valid
 passwords on the network. It will allow you to set settings such as maximum
 password length, password complexity, and how frequently passwords should
 change. Be sure to document all aspects of the password policy.
 n Account lockout Be sure to document now many bad logon attempts are
 allowed before an account is locked. Also document how long the account is
 locked for. 580 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 n User rights Document any extra privileges that are given to users on the
 network. For example, if you allow Bob to back up files from the server, then
 you want to be sure to document those extra rights.
 n Audit policy It is important to document your audit policy so that at any
 point and time you can determine what level of auditing is enabled on the
 network. Be sure to document what events are being audited and whether
 you are auditing the success or failure of a given event.
 n Firewall policy An important network feature to document is the firewall
 policy. When documenting the firewall policy, document what the default
 rule is, either accept all traffic or deny all traffic, and then document each
 rule. You don’t want to have to rebuild all those rules without any reference!
 n Software restriction policy The software restriction policy will determine
 what applications are allowed to run on the computers. You want to be sure
 to document the rules in the software restriction policy so that if you have
 problems with an application running, you can refer to the policy to find out
 if there is a reason the application does not run.

 Along with documenting any policy settings on the network, you will also want
 to make sure that you document all network procedures. Some examples of network
 procedures that should be documented are backup procedures, restore procedures,
 server recovery procedures, device replacement procedures such as for a router or
 switch, and also hard drive replacement procedures.
 Documenting the procedures to perform maintenance on the network will help
 when the time comes to perform those tasks. You will not need to scramble to figure
 out how to perform these tasks that were configured so long ago—you simply look at
 the documentation.
 I would like to make two last points about network documentation. The first is
 to be sure to maintain the documentation by keeping it up-to-date as changes to
 the network occur. Network documentation

CertifiCation objeCtive 11.07


Maintaining logs
 Another form of information that is extremely valuable is log files. Most
 operating systems and server software maintain a record of activity in a log
 file. For example, if you are using Microsoft’s web server, Internet Information
 Services (IIS), by default it logs any visits to your web site in a text file. The
 benefit of having the information in a log is that if you notice suspicious activity
 with the system, you can look at the log file and view information such as the
 date and time someone visited the site, their IP address (client IP), what page
 they requested, and what program they used (User-Agent). Figure 11-17 displays
 a web log from an IIS Server.



figUre 11-17 Looking at a web server log file 582 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 The following are popular log file locations in Windows that you can use to find
 log files:

 n Microsoft Web Server Stores the log files in the c:windowssystem32
 logfilesw3svc1 directory.
 n Microsoft FTP Server Stores the log files in the c:windowssystem32
 logfilesmsftpsvc1 directory.
 n Windows Clustering Stores the log files in the c:windowssystem32

 n Firewall log If you turn on logging in the Windows Firewall in the
 Advanced Settings of the firewall, you can log dropped packets to the default
 log file of c:windowspfirewall.log.
 n Audit logs Stores the log entries in the Security Log of the Windows Event
 Viewer. The files for the event viewer are stored in the c:windowssystem32
 config folder, but you will use the Event Viewer to view the log entries.

 Unix and Linux use a number of log files as well to record activity on the system.
 The following are some popular log files in Linux:

 n Linux system log file Most system and kernel messages are logged into
 the /var/log/messages text file. For example, failed logins or newly detected
 hardware messages show up in this file.
 n Linux last login file The /var/log/lastlog file lists the username, IP address,
 and date/time of user logins. Use the lastlog command to view this data.
 n Linux Apache Web Server logs Apache stores error and access log files
 under /var/log/apache2. Since these are text files, use any text editor to
 view them.

 A number of log files are created with each operating system. Be sure to spend
 some time and find where the software you support logs information.

of the network. When it comes to hardware and software upgrades, make sure that
you have tested the upgrade in a lab first so that you do not find out about upgrade
problems on production systems. It is critical to back up the system before applying any
major upgrade so that if something does go wrong, you have a recent backup to rely on.
 Make sure that you have installed antivirus software on all servers and desktop
systems. You will also need to schedule a virus scan on the systems regularly and to
update the virus definitions often. The virus definitions list is a list of all the known
viruses at the time the virus definition file was created.
 You will most likely want to load antispyware software on computers on which
users spend a lot of time surfing the Internet. Spyware and adware are malicious
programs that can be installed on your system without your knowledge. This
malicious software is a security risk because it can monitor your activity, and it can
dramatically slow system performance.
 It is extremely critical that you back up data regularly. You should back up data
provided by all services, including file and print services, database servers, and e-mail
services. Further, you should make sure that you perform a backup of the operating
system so that you can get it up and running quickly when presented with a system
failure.
 There are three major types of backups: a full backup, an incremental backup, and
a differential backup. A full backup backs up any file that you select, whether the
archive bit is set or not, and then clears the archive bit. An incremental backup only
backs up a file that has the archive bit set, and also clears the archive bit when it is
done. A differential backup backs up any files that have the archive bit set and does
not clear the archive bit when it is done.
 When restoring from an incremental backup, you will need to restore the last full
backup and then each incremental since the last full backup. When restoring from
a differential backup, you will need to restore the last full backup and then the last
differential. If you perform full backups every night, you will need to restore only the
last full backup.
 Fault tolerance is the concept of trying to keep things running when there is a
failure in a device. In this chapter you looked at disk fault tolerance and how to
set up your server so that if a disk fails you can still have the server running. To
implement disk fault tolerance you implement a level of RAID.
 RAID level 0 is known as striping. When a users saves a file to a RAID 0 volume,
the file is split across all drives in the RAID 0 volume, which increases performance
because you have multiple drives taking care of the save operation at the same
time. There is no fault tolerance with RAID level 0. RAID level 1 is known as disk
mirroring. Disk mirroring is responsible for duplicating all the data that is saved to
the RAID 1 volume to the two drives that are mirrored. RAID level 5 stripes the 584 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 data as RAID 0 does, but there is data redundancy, or parity information, stored with
 the data as well. If a drive fails in a RAID 5 volume, the system continues to run,
 reading the data from the RAID 5 volume.
 As a network professional, always remember to set and follow strict policies that
 control use of software, passwords, account lockout, and auditing. Be sure to get
 management approval when designing the policies, and then implement the policies
 on the appropriate systems.
 To help prepare for the day when you need them, be sure to be familiar with
 what level of logging your systems and software can perform. Also, know where the
 information is logged, so that you can access the logs when you need to.
 Always remember that a well-planned network design will always require
 documentation for the physical and logical aspects of the network. Be sure to store
 the documentation in a secure location and update it as the network changes. Two-Minute Drill 585

 turer’s web site for the device.
 q Be sure to create a test lab to verify that any hardware or software upgrade is
 tested with all your existing hardware and software. You do not want to do
 the install on production systems without testing them first.

 installing Patches and Updates
 q Be sure to keep your systems up-to-date with patches and service packs. Most
 vulnerabilities are fixed with a software patch.
 q A hot-fix is something that can’t wait for the next service pack release. You
 should test and then apply any hot-fix as soon as possible.
 q A service pack includes all updates since the release of the product. If you
 install a server and service pack 2 is the current service pack, you will not
 need to install service pack 1 and service pack 2—just service pack 2. You
 will need to get any updates released since service pack 2 in this example.
 q You can use the Software Update Service in Microsoft environments to
 deploy updates across the network. This will simplify the management of the
 updates.

 antivirus and antispyware software
 q After installing your antivirus software, make sure that you have scheduled
 regular virus scans.
 q Make sure that you have the real-time protector enabled on your antivirus
 software so that any time you access a file, the virus protection software
 checks the file for viruses.
 q Make sure that you keep your antivirus software up-to-date by downloading
 the most current virus definitions.
 q Install server-based antivirus software on e-mail servers so that incoming mail
 is scanned before it is deposited into the user’s mailbox. 586 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 backing Up network Data
 q Make sure that you have a tape rotation schedule, and be sure to store a copy
 of backups offsite in case of disaster.
 q Schedule backups to occur regularly.
 q If the amount of data is too much to perform a full backup each night,
 create a backup plan that combines your full backup with an incremental or
 differential backup.
 q A full backup backs up any selected file whether the archive bit is set or not
 and then clears the archive bit.
 q An incremental backup backs up only the selected files that have the archive
 bit set and then clears the archive bit after the backup.
 q A differential backup backs up only the selected files that have the archive
 bit set and does not clear the archive bit.

 Providing fault tolerance
 q Fault tolerance is the concept of ensuring that you can still have a solution
 running if part of the solution fails. For example, if you lose a power supply in
 a server, there would be a second one waiting to take over.
 q RAID is a disk fault-tolerance technology that involves multiple drives
 storing the data. Depending on the RAID level you use, you can still
 get access to data if a disk fails because a copy of the data is stored on
 another disk.
 q RAID level 0, known as disk striping, does not provide any fault tolerance.
 RAID 0 is used to increase performance with read and write operations
 because the data is split up and written to all disks in the solution at the
 same time.
 q RAID level 1 is known as disk mirroring. RAID 1 stores a full copy of the
 data on both members of the mirrored volume so that if one disk fails, the
 other disk still has a copy.
 q RAID level 5 is also known as disk striping with parity, whereby the data is
 striped across multiple disks. However, it does store parity information so that
 if a disk fails, the missing data can be recalculated. Two-Minute Drill 587


network Documentation
 q Be sure to document all aspects of the network, including the physical
 structure such as placement of routers and switches.
 q You should document the link speeds between different branches and your
 routers.
 q Document the logical structure such as VLAN configuration.


Maintaining logs
 q There are a number of log files created with each operating system; be sure to
 spend some time and find where the software you support logs information.
 q Most Windows software logs to the c:windowssystem32logfiles folder.
 q Review the logs on a regular basis. 588 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network

network Upgrades
 1. þ B. It is important to remember that as your hardware gets older you can update the BIOS
 or ROM code on that server or device to bring it up-to-date with feature or technologies that
 have come out since the manufacturer built the device.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Purchasing a new server is a very expensive way to take
 advantage of new technologies. Simply flashing the BIOS would be a cheaper solution.
 Formatting the hard drive has nothing to do with the solution.
 2. þ D. Before performing any kind of hardware or software upgrade, you should make sure that
 you have tested the upgrade first. After you have tested the upgrade, before performing the
 upgrade on a production server, make sure that you have backed up the production server in
 case something goes wrong.
 ý B is incorrect. You would never delete user data, because you will find yourself very busy
 restoring that data back from the backup resource.

installing Patches and Updates
 3. þ C. A hot-fix is a critical update that cannot wait for the next service pack to be supplied.
 You should apply hot-fixes right away. Make sure that you have tested the hot-fix on a test
 system first.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because they all imply that the update should not be applied
 immediately.
 4. þ D. Windows Update is a feature of Microsoft operating systems that allows the user to use
 Windows Update to connect to the Windows Update site, from which updates are downloaded
 for that operating system.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. System Restores are a feature of Windows XP to bring the
 system back to the state of the last restore point. Windows Messenger is an online “chat” type of
 software, and Backup is the software used to perform a backup of the system.
 5. þ C. Windows Software Update Service is a service that can be installed on a Windows
 server that allows you to manage deployment of patches and updates from a central point.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. Windows Update is where WSUS gets the updates from, but
 WSUS helps deploy the update to all your systems. Active Directory is the Microsoft directory
 service and is not really used to deploy updates. 594 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



antivirus and antispyware software
 6. þ C. Spyware is malicious software planted on your system that can monitor your Internet
 activity.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. A virus, a Trojan, and a worm are all malicious software that
 damages the system or slows it down.
 7. þ D. It is critical that you keep your virus definitions up-to-date. The virus definitions are
 the part of the virus protection software that makes the virus protection software aware of what
 viruses exist. Virus protection software vendors are constantly updating their definitions, and
 you can download the updates from the Internet through the virus protection software.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect because none of those are real features of virus protection
 software.
 8. þ A. Real-time protection saves you from needing to run a virus scan manually, because as
 you open files or access files, the virus protection software scans the file being accessed.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because these are not features of virus protection software.

backing Up network Data
 9. þ B. Incremental backups clear the archive bit after backing up a file that has changed.
 Because the archive bit is cleared, the file will not be backed up with the next incremental
 backup unless it is changed again.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. A full backup backs up any file that is selected whether it has
 changed or not. A differential backup backs up a file that has changed but does not clear the
 archive bit. A copy backup does not clear the archive bit; it is like a full backup in that it backs
 up any file you select.
10. þ C. You will need to restore the last full backup and each incremental backup up to
 the crash in this scenario. Each incremental backup applies the changes since the previous
 incremental, and all incrementals build on the full backup being performed, bringing the server
 up-to-date.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because they are all incorrect restore strategies when combining
 full backups with incremental backups.
11. þ D. You should make sure that you store a copy of your backups offsite in a safe, trusted
 location. The purpose of having the tapes stored offsite is to be able to recover from a disaster to
 your premises that would destroy servers and backups.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect because they are all locations where a backup could be stored
 that will still make the backup media vulnerable to disaster along with the server. Self Test Answers 595


12. þ C. A differential backup backs up any file that has changed but does not clear the archive
 bit. This is useful because each differential backup includes all changes from the time of the last
 full backup to the time of the differential backup.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. Full backups back up any file that is selected whether it has
 changed or not and clears the archive bit. An incremental backup backs up only files that have
 changed and clears the archive bit, whereas a copy backup backs up any file that is selected and
 does not clear the archive bit.
13. þ B. For this scenario you would restore Sunday’s full backup to create a starting point and
 then apply the last differential backup to bring the server up-to-date to the time of the last
 differential.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not restore strategies used with full backups and
 differential backups.
14. þ B. The best thing to do is to schedule your backups so that you are not dependent on
 memory and the backup is performed automatically.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Although you should create a backup plan, the plan does not
 actually ensure that the backups are performed. Make certain that you schedule the backups!
15. þ B. Make sure that you have a backup plan and that it is up-to-date so that all systems
 administrators know what is being backed up and what the restore strategy is in case of failure.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because none of these options guarantees that all persons
 involved in the day-to-day network operations understand the backup strategy.

Providing fault tolerance
16. þ B. RAID level 1 is disk mirroring; it mirrors, or duplicates, the data from one disk to
 another in case of a disk failure.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. RAID level 0 is known as disk striping and is responsible for
 saving the data across multiple disks but with no redundancy. RAID level 5 is disk striping but
 does store parity data as well, which provides fault tolerance.
17. þ A. RAID level 0 is known as disk striping and is responsible for saving the data across
 multiple disks but with no redundancy. The benefit is strictly for performance—multiple disks
 working at saving your data at the same time.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. RAID level 1 is disk mirroring; it mirrors, or duplicates, the data
 from one disk to another in case of a disk failure. RAID level 5 is disk striping but does store
 parity data as well, which provides fault tolerance.
18. þ C. RAID level 5 is also known as striping with parity and stores parity data as well as
 writing the data across all disks. 596 Chapter 11: Maintaining and Supporting a Network



 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. RAID level 0 is known as disk striping and is responsible for
 saving the data across multiple disks but with no redundancy. RAID level 1 is disk mirroring; it
 mirrors or duplicates the data from one disk to another in case of a disk failure. RAID level 5 is
 disk striping but does store parity data as well, which provides fault tolerance.
19. þ A. Disk Management is the tool used to create volumes on a Windows server.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not used to create RAID volumes on a
 Windows server.
20. þ D. Disk duplexing is the duplication of data on multiple disks, but the disks are connected
 to two different disk controllers.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Disk mirroring stores copies of the data on multiple disks but
 uses only one disk controller. The other choices do not duplicate the data.

network Documentation
21. þ A and C. Routers and WAN links make up part of the physical structure of the network
 and therefore are part of that documentation.
 ý B and D are incorrect because they are part of documenting the logical structure of the
 network.
22. þ B and D. You need to ensure that you update the network documentation as changes are
 made to the network. For security reasons you want to make sure that you shred any old copies
 and store the updated documentation in a secure location.
 ý A and C are incorrect. For security reasons you should shred the documentation, not throw
 it out.

Maintaining logs
23. þ B. The IIS log files are stored in the windowssystem32logfiles folder. There is then a
 separate subfolder for each service. If you host multiple web sites on the web server, then there
 will be a folder per web site with the logs for that web site.
 ý A, C, D are incorrect because they are not the location of where IIS stores the log files. 12

 T oday’s networks are becoming more dispersed and widespread, given the impact the
 Internet has had on extending the network out to roaming users and business partners.
 It is extremely important that as you design the network you consider the impact your
 design will have on the overall security of the organization and its resources. It is important to
 ensure that resources are protected and that data traveling on the wire or in the air is protected
 through encryption.

 In this chapter you will be introduced to a number of security-related terms
 and learn what features of the operating system are used to help protect network
 resources. You will learn what a firewall is and the general steps used to configure
 a firewall. You will also learn different protocols used to encrypt network traffic for
 wired networks and wireless networks. This chapter also lists some basic guidelines

Understanding attack types
 Due to the complexity of software and networks today, most systems and applications
 are susceptible to a number of different types of security attacks. Understanding the
 different types of attacks and methods that hackers are using to compromise systems
 is essential to understanding how to secure your environment. This section will
 introduce you to a number of different types of attacks.
 There are two major types of attacks:

 n Social engineering attacks
 n Network attacks



social engineering
 With a social engineering attack, the attacker compromises the network or system
 through social interaction with an individual, through an e-mail message or phone Understanding Attack Types 599


call, and tricks the individual into divulging information that can be used to
compromise security. The information that the victim divulges to the hacker would
most likely be used in a subsequent attack to gain unauthorized access to a system
or network.
 The key to protecting yourself and fellow employees from social engineering attacks
is education! Keeping all personnel aware of the popularity of social engineering
attacks and the different scenarios that could be examples of social engineering attacks
will help raise the security level of the organization.
 There are a number of different examples of social engineering attacks. The
following are some of the most popular scenarios:

 n Hacker impersonates administrator In this example, the hacker may call
 the employee and impersonate the network administrator. The hacker will
 try to convince the employee to change their password or divulge password
 information.
 n Hacker impersonates user In this example, the hacker calls an
 unsuspecting network administrator and plays the role of a frustrated user
 who cannot log on to the network. The network administrator naturally
 helps the “user” by resetting the password and helping them log on—problem
 being it is actually the hacker!
 n Hacker impersonates vendor In this example, the hacker may e-mail a
 customer pretending to be the vendor of a piece of software. In this example,
 the hacker tries to get the user to install an update, but the user doesn’t
 realize the update is really a Trojan virus that gives the hacker access to the
 system.


Phishing attack
A very popular type of attack today is what is known as a phishing attack! A
phishing attack is when the hacker creates a fake web site that looks exactly like
a popular site such as the bank or eBay. The phishing part of the attack is that the
hacker then sends an e-mail message trying to trick the user into clicking a link
that leads to the fake site. When the user attempts to log on with their account
information, the hacker records the username and password and then tries that
information on the real site. 600 Chapter 12: Network Security




network-based attacks
 Most types of attacks are considered network-based attacks where the hacker
 performs the attack from a remote system. There are a number of different types of
 network attacks:

 n Eavesdropping attack This widely used type of attack typically involves the
 use of network monitoring tools to analyze and read communications on the
 network.
 n Spoof attack In a spoof attack, the hacker modifies the source address
 of the packets he or she is sending so that they appear to be coming from
 someone else. This may be an attempt to bypass your firewall rules.
 n Hijack attack In a hijack attack, a hacker takes over a session between
 you and another individual and disconnects the other individual from the
 communication. You still believe that you are talking to the original party
 and may send private information to the hacker unintentionally.
 n Denial of service A denial of service (DOS) is a type of attack that causes
 the system or its services to crash. As a result, the system cannot perform its
 purpose and provide those services.
 n Distributed denial of service (DDOS) The hacker uses multiple systems to
 attack a single target system. A good example is the SMURF attack, in which
 the hacker pings a number of computers but modifies the source address of
 those packets so that they appear to come from another system (the victim in
 this case). When all of these systems receive the ping request, all systems will
 reply to the same address, essentially overburdening that system with data.
 n Buffer overflow A buffer overflow attack is when the attacker sends more
 data to an application than is expected. A buffer overflow attack usually
 results in the attacker gaining administrative access to the system in a
 command prompt or shell.
 n Exploit attack In this type of attack, the attacker knows of a security
 problem within an operating system or a piece of software and leverages that
 knowledge by exploiting the vulnerability.
 n Password attack An attacker tries to crack the passwords stored in a
 network account database or a password-protected file. There are three
 major types of password attacks: a dictionary attack, a brute-force attack,
 and a hybrid attack. A dictionary attack uses a word list file, which is a list Understanding System Security 601


 of potential passwords. A brute-force attack is when the attacker tries every
 possible combination of characters. With brute force a file is not read. A
 hybrid attack is similar to a dictionary attack in that it uses a word list file,
 but it also places numbers at the end of the word to catch passwords that
 are not dictionary words because the user placed a number at the end. For
 example, a dictionary attack would not find the password “pass1,” but a
 hybrid attack would.




 Be sure to know all of the with buffer overflow, denial of service,
 different types of attacks before taking spoofing, password attacks, and social

Understanding system security
 In this section you will be introduced to the differences between authentication and
 authorization and how those processes are used to allow or deny access to network
 resources. When securing network resources, you should first have users log on to the
 network with their own private usernames and passwords; once logged on, they will
 be able to access network resources to which they have been given permission. The
 process of logging on to the network is known as authentication, whereas controlling
 what network resources users may access once they have logged on to the network is
 known as authorization.


authentication
 Authentication is the process whereby users identify themselves to the network so
 that they can start accessing network resources. The method used to authenticate 602 Chapter 12: Network Security



 a user depends on the network environment and can assume forms such as the
 following:

 n Username and password When the users start the computer or connect to
 the network, they type a username and password that is associated with their
 particular network user account.
 n Smartcard Using a smartcard for logon is very similar to accessing your
 bank account at a teller machine. To log on to the network you insert a
 device similar to a debit card, known as a smartcard, into a smartcard reader
 and then supply a “PIN.” To be authenticated, you must have the smartcard
 and know its password.
 n Biometrics The user would provide a retina scan or fingerprint as a
 credential. Biometrics is becoming a very popular solution in highly secure
 environments where special biometric devices would be used.

 Whatever method is used to provide the necessary credentials, the outcome is the
 same in the sense that the credentials are sent to a directory service such as Novell
 eDirectory or Microsoft Active Directory, where they are verified. For example, if
 the username and password are correct, the user is authenticated and allowed to
 access network resources. Network servers also have the ability to authorize users to
 access different resources depending on how they are authenticated—for example,
 authentication through biometrics might give a user access to more resources than
 simple username and password authentication. If the credentials are incorrect,
 authentication fails and the user is denied access to the network, as shown in
 Figure 12-1.

 1 Password: mypass

 Active
 Windows Windows directory
 client server Understanding System Security 603


 When users provide credentials such as a username and a password, the
username and password are passed to the server using an authentication method.
A number of authentication methods are used in the Microsoft world as described
in the following list:

 n Anonymous Authentication You are not required to log on. Windows
 uses an account for the actual service, and you are passed through as
 that account. Whatever permissions the anonymous account has are the
 permissions you will have while you are connected anonymously. This is a
 popular authentication method for web sites or FTP servers.
 n Basic Authentication You are required to log on, and the username and
 password are sent to the server in clear text. This means that if someone has a
 packet sniffer between you and the server, that person will be able to capture
 your password and view it because it is not encrypted.
 n Integrated Windows Authentication You are required to log on to the
 server, but your username and password are sent to the server in an encrypted
 format. This authentication method is more secure than basic authentication
 if users are required to log on.

 The foregoing authentication methods are very “Microsoftish,” but there
are standard protocols used to perform authentication as well. The standard
authentication protocols used by various network services, such as RAS and VPN,
for authentication include the following:

 n Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) The Password Authentication
 Protocol sends the user’s credentials in plain text and is very insecure because
 of how easy it is for someone to analyze and interpret the logon traffic. This
 is the authentication protocol used by the basic authentication method
 mentioned previously.
 n Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) With the
 Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, the server sends a client a
 challenge (a key), which is combined with the user’s password. Both the user’s
 password and the challenge are run through the MD5 hashing algorithm (a
 formula), which generates a hash value, or mathematical answer, and that
 hash value is sent to the server for authentication. The server uses the same
 key to create a hash value with the password stored on the server and then 604 Chapter 12: Network Security



 compares the resulting value with the hash value sent by the client. If the two
 hash values are the same, the client has supplied the correct password. The
 benefit is that the user’s credentials have not been passed on the wire at all.
 n Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)
 MS-CHAP is a variation of the CHAP authentication protocol and uses
 MD4 as the hashing algorithm versus MD5 used by CHAP. MS-CHAP also
 uses the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol along with
 MS-CHAP to encrypt all traffic from the client to the server.
 n MS-CHAPv2 With MS-CHAP version 2 the authentication method has
 been extended to authenticate both the client and the server. MS-CHAPv2
 also uses stronger encryption keys than CHAP and MS-CHAP.
 n Extensible Authentication Protocol
 (EAP) The Extensible Authentication
 Protocol allows for multiple logon methods
 Be sure to review the such as smartcard logon, certificates,
 authentication protocols before taking Kerberos, and public-key authentication.
 the Network+ exam. EAP is also frequently used with RADIUS,
 which is a central authentication service
 that can be used by RAS, wireless, or VPN
 solutions.



Authorization
 Once you have been authenticated to the network, you will then be authorized to
 access network resources. There are various types of authorization, depending on
 what it is that you are trying to be authorized for. For example, if you are trying
 to access a file on the network, authorization is determined according to the
 permissions assigned to the file. If you are trying to change the time on the server,
 authorization is determined by your privileges or rights.

 Permissions vs. Rights
 In the Microsoft world, there is a difference between a permission and a right, so it is
 important to make that difference clear.
 A permission is your level of access to a resource such as a file, folder, or object.
 The permission is a characteristic of the resource and not a characteristic of the user
 account. For example, if you would like to give Bob the read permission to a file, you Understanding System Security 605


 would go to the properties of that file and set the permissions. Notice that you do
 not go to the user account to assign the permissions.
 A right is your privilege within the
 operating system to perform a task. For
 example, when companies deploy Windows

 that administrators can configure the operating system only because the group
 that they are members of is assigned all the rights.
 At times a right can override permissions, because the privilege you have been
 assigned takes precedence over everything else. For example, when configuring
 a server I typically configure folders that contain sensitive data with permissions
 that do not allow administrators access to the folder. It is extremely important
 to understand that when configuring security, I cannot prevent people from
 performing their jobs, so the question is, can the administrator still perform
 backups of the folder if he does not have permissions to read the contents of the
 folder? The answer is yes, because the administrator has the right to back up files;
 although he has no permission to the folder, he can read from the folder when
 running backup software.


Windows security subsystem
 To help you understand more about authentication and authorization, we will
 discuss the underlying architecture of Windows and its security subsystem. In this
 section we overview the logon process and discuss different core services that take
 part in the authentication and authorization process.
 There are a number of components that make up the security subsystem in
 Windows, each playing an integral part in the security functions provided by
 the operating system. Table 12-1 lists the security subsystems and gives a brief
 description of them. 606 Chapter 12: Network Security




 table 12-1
 security subsystem Description
 Component
Components of
the Windows WinLogon User interface provided for interactive logon. The WinLogon
Security Model presents the logon screen when the user presses ctrl-alt-del.
 Local security authority Manages local security policies and user authentication. The
 (LSA) LSA is also responsible for generating the access token during
 the authentication process and writing events to the audit log
 when an alert is fired by the security reference monitor, based
 on the audit policy.
 Security reference Verifies that a user has the appropriate permissions or rights to
 monitor access an object. It also enforces the audit policy provided by
 the LSA.
 NetLogon A service that is used to verify the credentials used during
 logon against the SAM database.
 Security accounts Handles authentication services for LSA on a local Windows
 manager (SAM) system. The SAM is the database of user and group machine
 accounts on a local Windows system such as Windows XP. The
 SAM is typically used in a peer-to-peer Windows network.
 Active Directory Microsoft’s Directory Service in Windows 2000/2003/2008
 server. Active Directory is the name given to the network
 account database used to store all user accounts and
 groups that may access network resources. The Active
 Directory database resides on domain controllers and is kept
 synchronized.


 The logon process varies depending on whether you are logging on to the local
 SAM database or to the Active Directory database. The general steps of logging on
 to a SAM database are as follows:

 n User presses ctrl-alt-del to log on to the local system. The WinLogon
 process presents the user with the logon dialog box.
 n The user enters a username and password and then presses enter.
 n The LSA makes a call to an authentication package and then passes the
 logon information to the NetLogon service.
 n The NetLogon service then compares the username and password to the local
 SAM database.
 n Once verified, the NetLogon service returns the user’s Security Identifier
 (SID) and any groups the user is a member of to the LSA. Understanding System Security 607


 n The local LSA generate an “access token,” which contains the user account,
 any groups the user is a member of, and any rights the user might have.
 n The access token is associated with the user, and the Windows Explorer
 interface is started. The access token is assigned to any programs that are
 started by the user. This is important because if the user is not allowed to
 access a resource, she will be unable to access the resource by starting an
 application. Each application has the same security context as the user,
 because the access token is applied to the running program. Figure 12-2
 displays this logon process.

 When logging on to the network, the logon
 process differs dramatically because then users
 are authenticated by the Active Directory

 authentication:

 n The user presses ctrl-alt-del. The WinLogon process displays the username
 and password dialog.
 n The user enters a username, password, and a domain to log on to.
 n The logon credentials are passed to the LSA, which then queries DNS for a
 domain controller that can authenticate the user.

 n The LSA then contacts the key distribution center (KDC) on the domain
 controller and requests a session ticket.
 n Kerberos contacts Active Directory to authenticate the user.
 n Upon authentication, Kerberos retrieves the user’s universal group
 membership from the global catalog server.
 n After the user has been authenticated against Active Directory and every
 group membership has been determined, Kerberos sends a session ticket to
 the client that contains the user account’s SID and any group memberships.
 n The LSA then sends that session ticket to the KDC and requests a session
 ticket for the local workstation.
 n Kerberos sends a session ticket for the local system and the LSA; it then
 constructs an access token, which is assigned to any processes that the
 user starts.




 You will not be required to but be aware that Kerberos is a ticket-

 access tokens
 When a user logs on to a system or network, as part of the logon process an access
 token is created for the user and is used to determine whether a user should be
 allowed to access a resource or perform an operating system task. The token
 maintains all the information required for resource validation and includes the
 following information:

 n Security Identifier (SID) A SID is a unique number assigned to the
 user. The SID is what Windows uses to identify the user instead of the
 actual username. We know Bob as the bsmith user account, but Windows
 knows Bob as his SID, which looks something like S-1-5-21-2752813485-
 788270693-1974236881-116. Understanding System Security 609


 n Group Security Identifiers The access token contains a list of any groups
 that the user is a member of. This is important because when a user double-
 clicks a resource, the resource is normally configured with permissions
 assigned to groups. Windows checks to see which groups the user is a member
 of through the access token and then checks to see if one of those groups has
 permission to the resource being accessed. If a group that is contained in the
 access token is allowed access to the resource, the user will gain access to the
 resource.
 n Primary Group Security Identifier For POSIX compliance you can specify
 your primary group—this is the group that becomes the owner of files and
 directories in POSIX environments.
 n Access Rights During the logon process, Windows determines the rights
 you have within the operating system and stores the list of your rights within
 the access token. For example, if you have the Change the System Time
 right, that information will be stored in the access token during the logon
 process. If you try to change the time on the computer, your access token
 is checked for that right; if the right is in the access token, you would be
 allowed to change the system time.

 It is important to note that the access token is recreated only at logon, so if you
add a user to a new group, the user would need to log off and log on again for the
access token to contain the new group in the group membership list. After logging
on again, the user should be able to access any resources that the newly added group
can assess, because the access token has been updated.

security Descriptors and access Control lists
Most networking environments base their security model on using objects.
Everything is an object in the network world. For example, users, groups,
computers, folders, and files are all examples of objects that you will work with as
a network administrator. Every object has security-related information associated
with it, known as a security descriptor, which includes a very important piece of
information—the access control list (ACL). In general, the ACL is a list of users 610 Chapter 12: Network Security



 and/or groups allowed to access the object as well as the level of permissions those
 users and groups have. The ACL of an object will have many entries, with each
 entry representing a security principal (a user or group) that has been given a
 permission to that resource. Each entry that is contained in the ACL is known as
 an access control entry (ACE). For example, a folder may be set up to allow the
 Sales team read-only access, whereas the Marketing group may have the Modify
 permission. In this example, which is shown in Figure 12-3, the folder (which is the
 object) has two entries (ACEs) in the ACL, one for the Sales group and one for the
 Marketing group.
 There are two types of ACL within the security descriptor of an object: the
 system access control list (SACL) and the discretionary access control list (DACL).
 The security descriptor also contains attributes specifying who the owner of the
 object is and the primary group for that owner. Table 12-2 gives a summary of the
 security descriptor attributes that describe the security of an object. Figure 12-4
 displays the common attributes contained in the security descriptor of an object.

 access control list and what their level of access will be. For example, you may want
 (DACL) Accountants to be able to modify the contents of a file. The DACL
 will then have an entry for Accounts Allowed to Modify.
 Owner Maintains a record of the user who owns the resource. In the
 Microsoft world, the creator of the object is the person who owns the
 object. The owner of the object can change permissions of the object
 at any time. This means that the owner of the object is determined by
 the security descriptor of the object.
 Primary group This attribute specifies the primary group ID of the owner of the
 resource.


 In configuring security in a Windows environment, you have two types of security
 models that you could follow—user-level security and share-level security. With
 user-level security, when you configure security for the resource, you will use a
 DACL and pick which users have access to the resource. With share-level security,
 you simply place a password on the resource when it is shared, and any individual
 who knows the password can get access to the resource. Let’s first take a look at user-
 level security.

User-level security
 In Windows operating systems Windows XP, Windows Server 2003/2008, and Vista,
 you always use user-level security, which gives you no choice but to choose a list of
 users who can access the resources. Users who are not in the DACL will not be able
 to access the resource. Figure 12-5 shows a DACL on the security page of a Windows
 2003 system.
 When configuring the user-level security, you will need to first choose which
 users or groups (known as security principals) will get access to the resource. In
 Figure 12-5 you can see that Marketing and Sales have access to the folder. Once
 you choose which security principals may gain access to a resource, you then assign a
 set of permissions to each entry in the list. There are a number of permissions in any
 networking environment; Table 12-3 lists a few of the most common permissions
 found in the Microsoft world.

Assigned to Files the contents of files in the folder.
and Folders Read This is a folder and file permission that enables a user to

 Read&amp;Execute This is a folder and file permission that allows users to read
 the contents of files and to execute an executable.
 Write This is file and folder permission that allows a user to
 modify the contents of a file (write to it) or to create a new
 file or folder within that folder.
 Modify A folder or file permission that includes all the permissions
 mentioned previously. Having the Modify permission allows
 a user to read, execute, delete, list folder contents, and write
 to the contents of the folder or file.
 Full Control A folder or file permission that gives a user all permissions
 possible. If you assign the Full Control permission, the user
 will be able not only to modify the contents of the file but
 also to change the permissions on the resource as well.
 Special permissions Special permissions are permissions outside of the
 preceding permission list. You can assign custom
 permissions such as allowing a user to change permissions
 but not to modify the file.




share-level security
 Share-level security is a security mechanism supported in older Windows operating
 systems, such as Windows 95 and Windows 98 (as shown in Figure 12-6), that
 involves configuring the security on a resource, not by selecting which users have
 access to the resource but by assigning a password to the resource. Anyone who
 knows the password will have access to the resource.
 Share-level security is easy to implement and maintain on small peer-to-peer
 networks; however, users must remember the password for each resource that is
 shared. Access is very hard to control because anyone who knows the password can
 gain access. This is one reason user-level access is much more secure than share-level
 access and is the most popular method of implementing security. 614 Chapter 12: Network Security

securing the registry
 Part of securing a Windows system is also securing the Windows Registry. The
 Registry is a central database of all the user and computer settings on the system. If
 this information were accessible to a malicious user, the results could be disastrous
 and could cause the system to be dysfunctional. Because of the risk involved in
 accessing the Registry, Microsoft does not even list the utilities provided to modify
 the Registry with the rest of the administrative tools. These utilities, REGEDIT.EXE
 (for Windows) and REGEDT32.EXE (for Windows NT–based operating systems
 such as Windows 2000/XP), are located in the systemrootsystem32 directory. In the
 past, regedit.exe could not set permissions, while regedt32.exe was the registry editor
 you had to use to set permissions. Today’s operating systems allow you to use either
 regedit.exe or regedt32.exe to set permissions in the registry.
 There are two ways to secure the Registry. The first way is to secure the folder
 that holds the Registry files; the second way involves securing each section of
 the Registry. Let’s look at securing the Registry files. The Registry files are stored
 in the systemrootsystem32config folder, so you can secure the Registry by
 securing this folder—which is done for you by default. Figure 12-7, which shows
 the default permissions in Windows Server 2003 for the config folder, reveals that Understanding System Security 615


 figUre 12-7

 authenticated users (users who have logged on) have only the List Folder Contents
 permission. This means that they can only see that the files are there—they can’t
 modify them.
 The second method of securing the Registry is giving users or not giving users
 specific permissions to a particular area of the Registry. You can control these
 permissions by using regedt32.exe in Windows operating systems. Once you start
 regedt32.exe, you can right-click a folder (known as a key) and then choose
 permissions as shown in Figure 12-8.
 Once you choose the permissions command, you can modify the DACL for
 that section of the Registry. To make sure that users can only read a section of the
 Registry and not modify it, you can establish that authenticated users have only
 the Read permission in the permission list but not the Full Control permission.
 The Full Control permission would allow a user to create and delete items from the
 Registry. The Permissions dialog box is shown in Figure 12-9, while Exercise 12-1
 demonstrates how to secure the Registry with permissions. 616 Chapter 12: Network Security

 exerCise 12-1

setting Permissions on registry Keys
 In this exercise you will log on to Windows XP as a user named Bob, who does
 not have access to modify the Registry. You will subsequently log on as a network
 administrator and configure Registry permissions so that Bob can modify the
 contents of the Run area of the Registry. Keep in mind that you normally would
 not allow users to modify the Registry and this part of the exercise is simply for
 demonstration purposes.

 1. Log on to Windows XP as Bob with a password of “password.” If you do not
 have a bob account, you must create one.
 2. Select Start | Run and type regedt32, and press enter.
 3. In regedt32, navigate to Hkey_Local_MachineSoftwareMicrosoft

 4. Right-click the Run folder, and choose New | String Value (as shown in
 the following illustration). 618 Chapter 12: Network Security



 5. An error message should display (as shown in the following illustration),
 because Bob does not have permission to modify the Registry.




 6. Log on to Windows XP as an administrator account.
 7. Select Start | Run and type regedt32, and press enter.
 8. In regedt32, navigate to Hkey_Local_MachineSoftwareMicrosoft

 9. Right-click the Run folder, and choose Permissions (as shown in the
 following illustration). Understanding System Security 619


10. In the Permissions dialog box, select the users ACE and assign the Full

 to create an entry only in the Run portion of the Registry.




11. Click OK.
12. Log off as administrator.
13. Log on to Windows XP as Bob with a password of “password.”
14. Select Start | Run and type regedt32, and press enter.
15. In regedt32, navigate to Hkey_Local_MachineSoftwareMicrosoft

16. Right-click the Run folder and choose New | String Value.
17. Type test and press enter. You should be able to create the entry this time,
 because users were assigned full control of the Run portion of the Registry. 620 Chapter 12: Network Security




Configuring User rights
 In the Windows world, actions users can perform on the network and on their
 computers are controlled by a feature known as user rights. Remember that a right
 is an operating system privilege to perform a specific task and that your rights are
 stored in your access token after you have logged on. As the network administrator,
 if you need to change a user’s rights—for example, you want to allow users to be able
 to change the time on their computers—in Windows XP you may modify the Local
 Security Policy of the Windows XP system. If you want users to change the time on
 all computers on the network, you would change the Domain Security Policy, which
 controls the security settings for the entire domain. To change the user rights within
 the Domain Security Policy, go to Start | Administrative Tools | Domain Security
 Policy on your Windows 2003 domain controller.
 Once you have started the Domain Security Policy console, you should see a
 Local Policies item on the left. If you expand that by pressing the plus sign and then
 select User Rights Assignment, you will see all the users’ rights that can be modified
 (as shown in Figure 12-10).

rights assignments Understanding System Security 621


 There are a number of user rights displayed on the right side of the screen. If you
 want to modify a user right, you simply double-click the right and then define the
 policy and add users or groups to the right to specify that you want those individuals
 to perform that particular operating system task. Figure 12-11 displays adding the
 users group to the Change the System Time right.

Configuring auditing
 A major part of configuring network security is making sure that if a user tries to
 access a protected area of the network, or a hacker tries multiple times to crack a
 user’s password, you are aware of the malicious activity. Configuring auditing on your
 network server, whether it is Netware, Linux, or Windows, will allow you to identify

 suspicious activity on the server and take corrective action. Configuring auditing is
 a two-step process—you first need to define your audit policy, and then you need to
 monitor for suspicious activity day in and day out by reviewing the security log. Most
 auditing software can alert the administrator (usually through e-mail) of suspicious
 activity. For important network servers, it’s always best to have audit logs e-mailed to
 the administrator (otherwise, a hacker that compromises a machine might clear the
 audit logs). Understanding System Security 623


 Defining the audit Policy
 The first step to configuring auditing is to define your audit policy. When defining
 your audit policy, you want to enable auditing for specific events within the
 operating system. An event is something that happens within the system and is
 usually invoked by a user. For example, logging on or logging off of the network is an
 event. Accessing a folder is also an event. So you need to determine which events
 you wish to be notified of, and believe me, you need to be extremely picky as to
 which events you enable. The important thing to remember is that the more events
 you audit, the more information that is collected, and you don’t want to collect
 unnecessary information, because it will hide the important audited data.
 In the Windows world, there are a number of events you can enable auditing
 for, and when you enable auditing you have to decide whether you care about the
 success or the failure of such an event. For example, do you care whether someone
 successfully logs on to the network or fails to log on to the network? I am going
 to choose “we care to know if someone fails to log on to the network.” Table 12-5
 displays a list of the various events in Windows that you can enable the success or
 failure of.
 To enable auditing on Windows 2003 domain controllers, you would configure
 the Domain Controller Security Policy by going to Start | Administrative Tools
 | Domain Controller Security Policy. Once in the security policy, expand Local
 Policies and then select Audit Policy (as shown in Figure 12-12).

table 12-5 Auditing Events in Windows


audit event Description
Audit account logon Logs an entry each time a user logs on to the system, or domain, if auditing is
events enabled on the domain controller. If you want to monitor when users fail to log on
 to the network, you would enable this policy on the domain controller and monitor
 for failures. An entry will be recorded on the domain controller but not the local
 workstation, because the logon request is sent to the domain controller.
Audit account Enable this event if you want to be notified when a user or group is created or
management modified. This is a great event to enable the success of, because you can monitor
 when a user account is created. If you enable auditing on account management,
 you will become aware that a hacker has created a backdoor account, if in fact
 he got that far. This event also tracks the resetting of user passwords and group
 membership changes.
Audit directory Audits access to Active Directory objects if auditing is enabled on a particular
service access Active Directory object.
Audit logon events If you want to audit the event that a user attempted a logon to the domain from the
 workstation and to record the audit data on the workstation, you would enable this
 event. If you were to enable audit account logon events instead of this event, there
 would be no data recorded on the local system when a user logs on to the domain,
 because the local system did not attempt to answer the logon request.
Audit object access You can audit folders, files, and printers if you enable this audit policy. Auditing
 folders, files, and printers is a two-step process—you would need to enable this
 policy and then enable auditing on any folders or files you want to audit.
Audit policy change If you enable this event, it will allow you to monitor any changes to the security
 policy, such as auditing and user rights.
Audit privilege use Audits anyone who takes advantage of any rights they have been given. For
 example, if you give Bob the right to back up files and directories, you may want
 to know when he actually does a backup to prevent him from performing an extra
 backup and taking private corporate data home with him.
Audit process Handles events that deal with programs, such as monitoring when a program
tracking activates, program exits, and indirect object access.
Audit system events Enables auditing for system startup and shutdown events; also audits any event that
 affects the security log or the system security as whole.


 Once you have enabled auditing, you need to monitor the security log for the
 recording of such events. One of the biggest mistakes network administrators make
 is to put a lot of focus on ensuring that they have enabled auditing but never look
 at the audit log. As a result, they never know whether their security has been
 compromised, defeating the purpose of auditing! Understanding System Security 625


 Make sure that each day you allow enough time to monitor the security
 log for suspicious activity. A good idea is to take the first 30 minutes of your
 morning to review, archive, and then clear the security log while you have your
 morning coffee.



 Monitoring the security log
 Once you have enabled auditing, you should monitor the security log in Windows
 Event Viewer, because that is where all audited data appears. Figure 12-13 shows the
 Windows Event Viewer in Windows 2003. In the event viewer, you can review the
 various events, save the contents of the log to a file for your own records, and then
 clear the log to start a clean one for the day. It is important to archive the log in case
 you need to go back to it at a later time. A lot of security problems are not noticed
 until long after the event has occurred. Windows also allows you to store the log file
 to any location, including on another secured host.
 To review the security log in Windows Server 2003, select Start | Administrative
 Tools | Event Viewer. Once in the Event Viewer, select the Security log on the
 left side, and you will see all the security events. The events with a lock are failure
 events, and events with a key are success events. Figure 12-13 displays the security
 log on a Windows Server 2003, and Exercise 12-3 demonstrates how to enable
 auditing of account management and failures to log on.
 Notice in Figure 12-14 that once auditing has been enabled, you can see that
 a user has failed to log on to the network on June 27, 2005 at 10:41 a.m. When
 reviewing the security log, if you need more information about the event, double-
 click the event and the properties appear, as shown in Figure 12-14.

 auditing in linux and novell
 Linux uses the syslogd daemon to audit activity (a daemon is a computer program
 that is always running on a host, even if nobody is logged in—similar to a Windows
 service). Syslogd reads its configuration from sys:etc/syslog.conf to determine what Firewalls and Proxy Servers 627


 to audit and whether or not to notify the administrator of suspicious activity.
 Linux administrators also have a wealth of operating system commands, such as
 last, which lists currently logged-on users, and lastlog, which lists the last logon
 time for all users.
 Novell servers include NSure Audit Services to audit eDirectory and file system
 activity. As with Windows and Linux, you configure what to audit for whom and
 decide whether or not to notify someone about suspicious activity.



CertifiCation objeCtive 12.03


firewalls and Proxy servers
 A number of organizations and individuals have an Internet connection allowing
 them to communicate with the outside world. Although this is a great flexibility
 allowing access to a wealth of information, there are a number of security risks
 involved in connecting directly to the Internet. As a general rule, you should always
 put another device between you and the Internet, and that device is known as a
 firewall.


firewall architecture
 Firewalls are designed to protect systems on one side of the firewall from systems
 on the other side by analyzing packets that reach the firewall and determining
 whether the packet is allowed to pass through. You will configure rules on the
 firewall that indicate to the firewall which traffic is to pass through and which is
 to be blocked.
 For example, as a general rule you should configure the firewall to block all traffic,
 meaning that no traffic can pass through. Once you have configured the “default”
 rule of blocking all traffic, you can configure exceptions to the rule, allowing
 selected traffic to pass through. For example, if you have a web server that you want
 to expose out to the Internet, you would block all traffic except TCP port 80, the
 port on which web server traffic runs (as shown in Figure 12-15).
 Before we consider how to create these firewall rules, let’s look at some firewall
 configurations that are currently used in networking environments. 628 Chapter 12: Network Security

 For the Network+ exam you need to be one system.



 Dual-Homed Host firewalls
 A dual-homed host firewall consists of a single computer with two physical network
 interfaces that acts as a gateway between the two networks. The server’s routing
 capability is disabled so that the firewall can handle all traffic management. Either
 application-level proxy or circuit-level firewall software is run on this system to pass
 packets from one side of the dual-homed system to the other. You must be careful
 not to enable routing within the network operating system that will be used as the
 dual-homed system or you will bypass your firewall software and simply be routing
 data. Figure 12-16 shows a dual-homed host firewall configuration.

 screened-Host firewalls
 Screened-host firewall configurations are considered by many to be more secure than the
 dual-homed firewall. In this configuration, you place a screening router between the
 dual-homed host and the public network. This enables you to provide packet filtering
 before the packets reach the dual-homed computer, thereby adding an extra layer of
 network security. The dual-homed computer can then run a proxy to provide additional
 security to this configuration. Figure 12-17 shows a screened-host configuration. Firewalls and Proxy Servers 629

 screened subnet firewalls
 A screened subnet firewall configuration takes security to the next level by further
 isolating the internal network from the public network. An additional screening
 router is placed between the internal network and the dual-homed firewall. This
 provides two additional levels of security. First, by adding a screening router
 internally, you can protect the dual-homed firewall host from an attack by an
 internal source. Second, it makes an external attack much more difficult because
 the number of layers that an attacker must go through is increased. Normally the
 outside screening router will be configured to pass any data that has passed the filter
 rule to the dual-homed firewall that will perform more tests on the incoming traffic.
 Once the incoming traffic has passed the test performed by the dual-homed system,
 the traffic may then be sent to the internal screening router, where additional tests
 on the packet are performed. The internal screening router is typically configured
 to accept only data from the dual-homed firewall, ensuring that hackers can’t skip
 past the outside firewall layers. Figure 12-18 shows the screened subnet firewall
 configuration. 630 Chapter 12: Network Security

firewall types
 There are three types of firewalls that can be used: packet-level firewall, application-
 level firewall, and circuit-level firewall. Each uses different security approaches, thus
 providing advantages over the others. When you have a complete understanding of
 the features and the type of security needed from a firewall, you can determine the
 implementation that bests fits your environment.

 Packet-filtering firewall
 A packet-level firewall is usually a form of screening router that examines packets
 based on filters set up at the network and transport layers. You can block incoming
 or outgoing traffic according to TCP/IP address or port address rules, so packet-level
 firewalls map to OSI layers 3 and 4 (network and transport layers, respectively).
 For example, you may choose to disable all incoming traffic but enable outbound
 traffic. You can also set up rules that will enable certain types of requests to pass
 while others are denied. The information that rules can be based on includes source
 address, destination address, protocol type, and source and destination port address.
 For example, if you intend to allow all incoming traffic from any system that is
 destined for port 80 on your web server’s IP address of 24.15.34.89 while disabling all
 other inbound traffic, you may configure a packet-filtering rule such as the following:


 Direction Protocol source Destination source Destination rule
 address address Port Port
 Inbound TCP Any 24.15.34.89 Any 80 Allow
 Inbound TCP Any Any Any Any Deny Firewalls and Proxy Servers 631


 Typically, the first rule that applies to the packet is what happens with the data. For
 example, with the foregoing rule if we have any inbound traffic destined for port 80
 on IP address 24.15.34.89, it would be allowed through, but any other traffic would be
 compared against the following rule, which would deny the traffic at the firewall.




 A packet-filtering firewall uses an access control list (aCl), which is
a list of rules on the firewall that are used to decide which traffic is allowed to pass
through the firewall.



 application-level firewall
 The application-level firewall understands the data at the application level.
 Application-level firewalls operate at the application, presentation, and session
 layers of the OSI model. Data at the application level can actually be understood
 and monitored to verify that no harmful information is included. An example of
 an application-level firewall is a proxy server. The proxy server can analyze the
 application data in the packet and decide if it is allowed through the firewall. This
 is different than a packet-filtering firewall, which can only analyze the header of the
 packet, including information such as the source and destination IP addresses and
 port numbers.
 In addition, clients often must be configured to pass through the proxy to use
 it—ideally after they have authenticated themselves properly. Proxy servers are also
 used to mask the original origin of a packet. For example, an Internet proxy will pass
 the request on, but the source address listed in the packet will be that of the proxy
 server address and not of the client that made the request. The overall server doesn’t
 just filter the packets; it actually takes in the original and retransmits a new packet
 through a different network interface.

 Circuit-level firewall
 A circuit-level firewall is similar to an application proxy except that the security
 mechanisms are applied when the connection is established. From then on, the
 packets flow between the hosts without any further checking from the firewall.
 Circuit-level firewalls operate at the transport layer. 632 Chapter 12: Network Security




other firewall features
 As firewalls have evolved, additional feature sets have grown out of—or have been
 added to—the feature set of a firewall. These features are used to provide faster
 access to Internet content and better security mechanisms to help protect network
 resources. A few features that are implemented on firewall products, or are their own
 standalone products, are discussed in the following subsections.

 Caching servers
 Caching servers are used to cache Internet content on a server within your local
 LAN, so that if additional requests are made for the same content from a client,
 the content is delivered from the caching server—not retrieved from the Internet a
 second time. The benefit of such a technology is that you can conserve bandwidth
 on your Internet connection because the additional request for a resource that has
 been cached does not create network traffic on the Internet connection, but instead
 uses bandwidth on the LAN. There is no problem using LAN bandwidth, because
 LANs are typically a lot faster than a company’s Internet connection.

 Proxy servers
 By definition, a proxy server is a server that performs a function on behalf of another
 system. The employees who want to access the Internet perform the actions they
 normally would with their browser, but the browser submits the request to the proxy
 server. The proxy server then transmits the request on the Internet and receives the
 results, which are sent to the original requester. The benefit of a proxy is that anyone
 who captures the traffic sent out on the Internet would have the IP address of the
 proxy and not that of the internal network systems. Some proxy servers implement
 caching features as well, allowing the administrator to filter the web sites that are
 allowed to be viewed by internal clients.

 Port filtering
 Port filtering is a major part of building firewall
 rules. It is extremely important for you to
 be comfortable with the protocol (either

 TCP or UDP) and the port number used by

 Direction of transfer
 When creating a firewall rule you not only need to supply the layer-3 and layer-4
 address information, you also need to specify the direction of the traffic. Most times
 you will focus on inbound traffic for each of the firewall rules, but you may also
 control outbound traffic.

 source or Destination address
 On the firewall, we can filter packets based on the source or destination IP address
 contained in the IP header of the packet. This is a critical tool along with the port
 number (layer-4 header) because if you want to allow traffic into your network only
 from one of your other locations, you can specify the source address of your other
 location in the firewall rule.
 A nice feature of layer-3 filtering is that if you detect an intruder accessing
 the company network from the Internet, you can block any data coming into the
 network from the IP address of the intruder to help secure your data.

 stateful vs. stateless firewalls
 A typical packet-filtering firewall is known as a stateless inspection firewall
 because it simply allows or denies traffic based off the header of the packet (source/
 destination IP address or source/destination port number). It is possible that the
 attacker could alter the addresses in the header so that it fits into the rule placed
 on the firewall and then the firewall allows the packet into the network. In this
 example, the hacker has simply made up the packet and it really has no context. 634 Chapter 12: Network Security



 A stateful packet inspection firewall will look at the packet and the context of
 the conversation and if that is the packet that is supposed to be received at that
 point and time it allows the packet into the network. Stateful packet inspection
 firewalls use rules to filter traffic as well, but they also are smart enough to know the
 context of the conversation.

 Content filtering
 Another feature available with a number of proxy servers and firewalls is the feature
 of content filtering. Content filtering allows you to filter what information users are
 allowed to see when using an application. For example, we may allow web traffic
 out of the private network onto the Internet but we want to make sure that users on
 the network are not surfing inappropriate content. At the proxy server or firewall
 we create content filters that deny any traffic with certain content. For example, we
 may deny any web pages with the word “sex” in them.

 Zones
 Firewalls allow the network administrator to divide the network into different
 network segments known as zones. When creating your firewall plan, you will
 typically create three zones:

 n Private LAN The firewall placed in front of the private LAN will ensure
 that no traffic from any other network is sent through the firewall.
 n DMZ The DMZ is an area between two firewalls that allows selected traffic
 through from a public network such as the Internet. The DMZ is where we
 place any servers that need to reached by the general public, such as a web
 server, FTP server, or DNS server.
 n Public Zone The public zone is any network not controlled by the network
 administrator. The best and most popular example of a public zone is the Internet.

securing Communication
 As more companies go online with the Internet, the need to protect data becomes
 more prevalent. The information technology industry has striven to provide a
 more secure data transfer mechanism because TCP/IP was not designed as a secure
 network protocol. You can keep up-to-date with worldwide vulnerabilities affecting
 all vendors by visiting www.cert.org (Computer Emergency Response Team).
 The idea is to protect the data during a transfer and guarantee that it is sent to its
 recipient unread and unmodified. From this need, encryption services have grown
 in popularity. Multiple encryption implementations have been published and are
 now available to the public. Several standards have also come about that deal with
 encrypting data in transit, such as SSL and IPsec.
 To understand encryption, you must first learn how it works. You will also be
 introduced to some specific methods and algorithms used for encryption services. In
 addition, the main standards that have been defined will be explained, as well as a
 few other data protection methods.


Defining Data encryption
 Many different types of data encryption are available with each methodology,
 providing advantages and varying levels of security. To date, there are a number
 of complex encryption standards that have not yet been broken, along with other
 standards that use simple encryption methods and have been cracked but can still
 provide a level of security if used appropriately. Encryption can be defined as the
 process of taking plain text data and converting it to a meaningless format that
 is unreadable, better known as cipher text. Once the data has been transformed
 into cipher text, anyone wishing to decrypt the content would need to know the
 encryption key to convert the data back to plain text, as shown in Figure 12-19.
 The encryption key is passed through an encryption algorithm to encrypt the
 contents of the data. There are a limited number of encryption algorithms, so if a
 hacker knows the algorithm, that is not considered a security issue, but if a hacker
 obtains the encryption key, that is a compromise of network security. There are two
 popular forms of encryption: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric (public-key)
 encryption, each of which is discussed in the following subsections. Securing Communication 639

 symmetric Key encryption
 The most basic form of encryption is symmetric key encryption, so named because
 both the sender and the receiver of the data use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
 the data. The problem with symmetric key encryption is that you must have a
 secure way to transport the encryption key to individuals you wish to exchange data
 with. If you do not use a secure method to send the key to a recipient, someone
 may intercept the key. This makes encryption useless, because now the interceptor
 can decrypt the data knowing the key. In addition, if you are using encryption
 techniques for multiple recipients, you may not want one person to have access
 to another’s data. Now you must keep multiple single keys per person, which can
 become extremely cumbersome.

 asymmetric encryption
 A second form of encryption is asymmetric encryption, which uses a public-key/
 private-key pair for the encrypting and decrypting of the data. Asymmetric
 encryption requires two mathematically related but separate keys in order to perform
 the encryption/decryption work.
 With asymmetric encryption, the public key is freely distributed to anyone you
 choose. The second key, the private key, is kept in a secure location and is used only
 by you—hence the term “private.” Both keys are required to send data securely over
 a network structure. For example, say you want to send data to Bob by encrypting
 the content. You would retrieve his public key and encrypt the data with his public
 key. Once you have encrypted the data, you can send it over the wire knowing that
 anyone who intercepts the message would need the related key (Bob’s private key)
 to decrypt the message. Once you send the information on the wire, nothing but the
 related private key can decrypt the message, not even the public key you have. And 640 Chapter 12: Network Security



 because Bob is the only person who possesses the related private key, he is the only
 one who can decrypt the message, as shown in Figure 12-20.
 This system works well because it enables the public key to be sent over an
 insecure communications channel while still maintaining an appropriate level
 of security—remember that it would be difficult to share the key securely with
 symmetric encryption.




 For the Network+ exam while asymmetric encryption uses a pair
 know that symmetric encryption uses the of keys—one to encrypt and the other to
 same key to encrypt and decrypt the data, decrypt.



encryption Methods
 When encrypting data, different methods can be used. Each method has its own
 advantages and drawbacks, and some methods work in cooperation with others
 to provide an overall solution. The more common methods are discussed and
 explained here.

 stream Cipher
 Stream cipher algorithms encrypt data one bit at a time. Plain text bits are converted
 into encrypted cipher text. This method is usually not as secure as block cipher
 techniques, but it generally executes faster. In addition, the cipher text is always
 the same size as the original plain text and is less prone to errors. If an error occurs
 during the encryption process, usually this affects only a single bit instead of the
 whole string. In contrast, when block ciphers contain errors, the entire block
 becomes unintelligible.

 block Cipher
 Instead of encrypting a bit at a time, block cipher algorithms encrypt data in blocks.
 Block ciphers also have more overhead than stream ciphers, which is provided
 separately depending on the implementation and the block size that can be
 modified (the most common size being 64 bits). Because it handles encryption at a
 higher level, it is generally more secure. The downside is that the execution takes
 longer. Numerous block cipher options (shown in Table 12-7) are available, such
 as Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback
 (CFB), and Output Feedback Mode (OFB).

 Padding
 When encrypting data, plain text messages usually do not take up an even number
 of blocks. Many times, padding must be added to the last block to complete the data



 table 12-7
 block Cipher Mode Description
Block Cipher Electronic Codebook (ECB) Each block is encrypted individually. If information
Methods reappears in the same text, such as a common word,
 it is encrypted the same way.
 Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Feedback is inserted into each cipher block before
 it is encrypted. It includes information from the
 block that preceded it. This ensures that repetitive
 information is encrypted differently.
 Cipher Feedback (CFB) This enables one to encrypt portions of a block
 instead of an entire block.
 Output Feedback (OFB) This works much like CFB. The underlying shift
 registers are used somewhat differently. 642 Chapter 12: Network Security



 stream. The data added can contain all ones, all zeros, or a combination of ones and
 zeros. The encryption algorithm used is responsible for determining the padding that
 will be applied. Various padding techniques are available and used, depending on the
 algorithm implementation.


encryption standards
 As encryption has become more popular, the need for industry standards has arisen.
 Standards for different implementations and algorithms have been defined to move
 the industry in the same direction. The most popular standards are discussed here
 with a brief history and explanation.

 Des
 The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was created and standardized by IBM in 1977.
 It is a 64-bit block symmetric algorithm and is specified in the ANSI X3.92 and
 X3.106 standards for both enciphering and deciphering operations, which are based
 on a binary number. In addition, the National Security Agency (NSA) uses it as
 the standard for all government organizations. There currently exist 72 quadrillion
 (72,000,000,000,000,000) encryption keys for DES, in which a key is chosen at
 random. DES uses a block cipher methodology to apply a 56-bit symmetric key to
 each 64-bit block. An additional form of DES, known as triple DES, applies three
 keys in succession to each block.

 rsa
 Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman (RSA) were the individuals
 responsible for creating the RSA standard at MIT, which defines the mathematical
 properties for using the public-key encryption methodology. The algorithm
 randomly generates a very large prime number that is used for the public key,
 which is then consequently used to derive another prime number for the private
 key via mathematical computations (prime numbers have no pattern). Many
 forms of RSA encryption are in use today, including the popular PGP. PGP
 (Pretty Good Privacy) has worked well in the past. Some vendors have included
 implementations of RSA in their core application code. Versions 4–7 of Novell
 NetWare have RSA encryption built into the client and server to provide a secure
 communications channel. Securing Communication 643


Methods of securing traffic
 The Network+ exam requires you to be familiar with a number of technologies,
 along with their related terms, that can be used to secure network traffic. Securing
 network traffic refers to techniques that can be used to encrypt the network traffic
 that is sent along the wire (or in the air) between the two systems.

 Digital signatures
 Digital signatures are used to verify that a message that was sent is from the
 appropriate sender and that it has not been tampered with. When using digital
 signatures, the message is not altered, but a signature string is attached to verify its
 validity. Digital signatures usually use a public-key algorithm. A public key is used to
 verify the message, whereas the private key is used to create the signature. A trusted
 application is usually present on a secure computer somewhere on the network that
 is used to validate the signature provided. This computer is known as a certificate
 authority and stores the public key of every user on the system. Certificates are
 released containing the public key of the user in question. When these are dispensed,
 the certificate authority signs each package with its own private key. Several vendors
 offer commercial products that provide certificate authority services. For example,
 Microsoft Exchange Server can be set up to provide certificates to mail clients by
 using digital signatures. Lotus Domino also employs this strategy to authenticate
 client workstations to the server. Employing this methodology doesn’t mean you’re
 protecting your data completely, but you will know if it has been tampered with.
 It important not only to encrypt data traveling across the network, but also to
 encrypt it when it gets stored as a file—the lack of file encryption leads to theft
 of data, which is what we hear about increasingly. On Windows XP/2003/2008,
 certificates can be used to encrypt files on an NTFS partition through a feature
 known as the Encrypting File System (EFS). When implementing EFS in Windows
 2000, only the user who encrypted the file can decrypt the file and use it, but in the
 later Windows operating systems you can select additional persons who can decrypt
 the file. With EFS, the recovery agent always has the capability to decrypt a file as
 well, and by default the Administrator account is the recovery agent. The benefit of
 having the recovery agent is that if the person who encrypted the file is no longer
 available, the recovery agent can decrypt the file so that the organization can access
 the data. The disadvantage in some Windows versions is if the recovery agent user
 account is compromised, so is all of the encrypted data. To encrypt a file within the
 Windows operating systems, perform the steps in Exercise 12-5. 644 Chapter 12: Network Security



 To practice encrypting data on the drive with EFS, check out Exercise 12-5 in
ON THE CD
 LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM.


 internet Protocol security
 Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a fairly new security protocol that can be used
 to encrypt all IP traffic as well as take part in authentication services and ensure
 data integrity of information sent across an IP network. One of the things that is
 so exciting about IPsec is that if you enable IPsec, by means of an IPsec policy, you
 will not need to configure different encryption methods for each type of application
 you run on the computer—all IP traffic is encrypted by IPsec once the IPsec policy
 is implemented. For example, because IPsec encrypts all traffic you do not need to
 configure a separate encryption technology for your web server, FTP server, and
 Telnet server. They all run on top of TCP/IP, so IPsec can be used to secure traffic
 presented by each application. Exercise 12-6 demonstrates how to configure an IPsec
 policy on your web server and a web client.
 When you enable IPsec, you can use one of the default IPsec policies built-in. The
 IPsec policy is used to determine the type of traffic to be encrypted and the method to
 be used to encrypt the traffic. The three default IPsec policies are as follows:

 n Client (respond only) If asked to communicate securely, this system
 will respond by using IPsec, but it will never request or initiate secure
 communication.
 n Server (request security) When enabled, this system will request to use
 IPsec to secure traffic; if the remote system does not support IPsec, the system
 will communicate insecurely.
 n Secure Server (require security) This system will communicate with a
 remote system only if the remote system supports and uses IPsec.

 that you cannot tell which traffic is the HTTP traffic as opposed to other
 traffic because it is all Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) traffic, which is
 the encryption protocol used by IPsec. The following illustration is from the
 capture file called AfterIPSec.cap in your LabFilesPacketCaptures if you
 want to view the IPsec-enabled traffic. 650 Chapter 12: Network Security



 secure sockets layer
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a session-layer protocol that encrypts data sent from
 any higher-layer program such as FTP, HTTP, SMTP, and so on. SSL has become
 the standard method of encrypting traffic between a web client and a web server,
 ensuring that malicious users cannot capture such traffic and read it.
 SSL can work only with guaranteed transports—or basically anything using the
 TCP protocol—and is made up of the two protocols: SSL Handshake and SSL
 Record.

 n SSL Handshake is used to create a secure session between the two systems
 that are communicating. This includes all methods and parameters used for
 the encryption.
 n SSL Record is used to encrypt all data packets, including the SSL Handshake
 data packets.

 SSL is mainly used on e-commerce web sites during the exchange of personal
 information such as credit card numbers, because SSL can encrypt the traffic
 between the client and the server.

 Point-to-Point tunneling Protocol
 The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a VPN protocol used to create
 an encrypted tunnel over a TCP/IP network such as the Internet. All data that
 passes through the tunnel is in an encrypted format. The Point-to-Point Tunneling
 Protocol was dominant in older Microsoft VPN solutions and used Microsoft
 Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) to encrypt the traffic that passed through the
 tunnel.

 layer two tunneling Protocol
 The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a
 tunneling protocol similar to PPTP that creates
 PPTP and L2TP are VPN a tunnel over the Internet between two points
 protocols. PPTP uses MPPE to encrypt using PPP data packets encapsulated in TCP/
 VPN traffic and uses TCP port 1723. L2TP IP protocol packets (for regular networks, you
 uses IPsec to encrypt VPN traffic and uses can also use IPX/SPX and NetBEUI). While
 UDP 500, 4500, and 1701. using IPsec for encryption, the combination will
 create a VPN. L2TP is supported by Windows Securing Communication 651


2000 and higher operating systems but does not support implementation over ATM,
X.25, or Frame Relay networks.

Kerberos
Kerberos is a distributed authentication security protocol using private keys that
verify the validity of a user during logon and will repeatedly do the same every time
a request is made. This is useful when a user accesses the network from a workstation
that is not secure. A workstation might be in a public kiosk, and anyone may be
allowed to log on to the network as a guest, but regular users may visit the kiosk to
log on using their individual user accounts.

WeP
The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol is used to encrypt wireless traffic
from a wireless client to the wireless access point. Once the data reaches the wireless
access point, it is decrypted and then sent along the wired network if needed. WEP
uses a symmetric key configured on the access point and then on each client used to
encrypt the network traffic. It has been proven that a WEP encryption key is fairly
easy to break with products such as Airsnort or WEPCrack.

WPa
WiFi Protected Access (WPA) is the answer from the wireless community to
provide more security with wireless communications now that WEP has been
proven to be vulnerable to hackers. WPA has improved upon WEP by offering two
key features:

 n Improved encryption WPA scrambles the encryption keys by passing them
 through a hashing algorithm and then performing an integrity check to verify
 that the keys have not been tampered with. The protocol used to scramble
 the keys is the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which builds off
 WEP devices. Typically, only a software upgrade is needed for WEP devices to
 use WPA.
 n Authentication WPA uses EAP as the authentication protocol, which
 allows for more secure authentication using public-key encryption and
 authentication. WEP currently does not offer a method of authentication. 652 Chapter 12: Network Security



 WPA has been superseded by the more secure WPA2. For more information on
 wireless protocols such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2, read Chapter 7.



 802.1x
 Wireless security has generated much interest within the IT industry because it is
 such a convenient technology. It doesn’t need cables all over the place, but still,
 because of the lack of physical security, some form of authentication is needed to
 find out who is connecting to the wireless network.
 The 802.1x standard provides an authentication technique that leverages EAP
 and RADIUS to authenticate a user connecting to a network, including a wireless
 access point. Figure 12-21 displays a typical 802.1x authentication infrastructure.
 In the figure you can see that the wireless client is connecting to the wireless
 access point. The wireless access point sends the request to the Remote Authentication
 Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server for the user to be authenticated. The
 RADIUS server challenges the wireless client for a username and password. After
 the wireless client supplies the username and password to the RADIUS server, the
 RADIUS server authenticates the client, and the wireless access point allows the
 wireless client to access the network.




 Ensure that you are familiar with the protocols used to secure different
 types of network traffic.

Disaster recovery and fault tolerance
 This section introduces two significant topic areas: fault tolerance and disaster
 recovery. Fault tolerance is the concept of duplicating devices such as drives,
 power supplies, and network links so that if those components fail, another one
 becomes operative right away. If for some reason your fault tolerance plan is not
 effective, a disaster recovery procedure would be in place to help you recover from
 such failures.


fault tolerance
 Fault tolerance is the concept of ensuring that systems will continue to function
 because you have created a solution that involves having backup copies of power
 supplies, hard drives, and network links. If one of the links goes down, there would
 be another link ready to kick in at any time, reducing downtime and ensuring an
 available solution to clients on the network. The following is a list of widely used
 fault-tolerant components found on the network.

 n RAID solutions Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is the
 concept of storing redundant data on additional drives in case one drive in
 the RAID solution should fail. RAID solutions can apply to hardware or
 software. The hardware solution involves having a RAID controller that
 controls the RAID array, whereas in a software solution the RAID solution
 is managed by software such as the network operating system. The software
 solutions are cheaper, but the hardware solutions offer better performance
 and are more flexible. For more information on RAID volumes, refer to
 Chapter 11.
 n Power A number of network devices such as servers support a fault-tolerant
 power source such as a power supply in case the original power supply fails.
 n Network link In a number of networking environments a fault-tolerant
 network link is created to ensure that one network location can communicate 654 Chapter 12: Network Security



 with another location at all times or that there is a constant connection
 to the WAN environment or Internet. A number of business applications
 require a network link at all times; therefore, when you design the network
 infrastructure, you should decide whether the organization requires a fault-
 tolerant network link.



Disaster recovery
 Disaster recovery is a matter of ensuring that you can help the company recover
 from any kind of disaster. When preparing for disaster, you need to make sure that
 your disaster recovery plan includes backup and restore plans, contact information
 for product vendors, and step-by-step instructions on how to recover each part of
 your information systems.
 The disaster recovery plan should contain detailed steps for recovering from
 any kind of data loss or physical disaster. The step-by-step plan should contain the
 location of backup tapes, specify which tapes to restore in different scenarios, and list
 the steps for rebuilding servers, including detailed information on what to do when a
 disk fails and how to replace and rebuild the data.
 A number of disaster recovery documents overlook key elements such as
 location of software and CD keys needed to rebuild the system. Be sure that contact
 information for hardware and software vendors is included in the plan so that if you
 need to replace an item such as a disk you can contact the vendor.
 Along with detailed recovery steps, a disaster recovery plan should contain
 detailed information on backup and restore strategies, offsite storage, hot and cold
 spares, and hot and cold sites.

 backup and restore strategies
 Chapter 11 discussed various backup and restore strategies and emphasized the need
 to guarantee that a strong backup plan is in place to aid disaster recovery. If you have
 not created a strong backup plan that specifies what to back up and how frequently,
 you may not be able to recover from disaster. Be sure to review your backup
 strategy and make certain that you have all the necessary data stored on backup
 media. You should periodically verify that you can actually restore data using a test
 environment. Further, make sure that you know and have documented the restore
 strategy to implement when disaster strikes. Disaster Recovery and Fault Tolerance 655


 offsite storage
 It is absolutely critical that you store a copy of the backups offsite in a secure
 location. You cannot totally rely on the backups stored on your own site, because
 they will be of no value if the building burns down, destroying all your servers along
 with the tape backups stored at the location. You must make certain a copy of the
 backups is stored offsite.

 Hot and Cold spares
 When preparing for recovery, organizations typically maintain spares of equipment
 ready to be used in case of device failures. For example, they may have a spare power
 supply, hard drive, or network card available in
 case the original one fails. By having the spare
 available, you don’t need to wait for a part to
 be delivered to your facility after a device has
 Be sure to know the failed, creating excessive downtime. With a
difference between a hot spare and a spare available, downtime is minimized. There
cold spare for the exam. are two types of directions that you can take
 with spares, listed as follows:

 n Hot spares A hot spare is a spare component that is typically connected
 and powered on in case the primary device should fail. When the primary
 device fails, failover kicks in, allowing the spare device to take over the
 workload immediately. No time is needed to connect the device or power on
 the device—hot spares are ready to work.
 n Cold spares A cold spare is a device that is not powered and is usually
 sitting on a shelf in a server room. A cold spare involves an increase in
 downtime, because the device must be connected and powered up before it
 can take over the function of the original device.


 Hot, Warm, and Cold sites
 Disaster involves more than your servers and the data on them; you need to ask
 yourself, “How can I continue business in the event of a disaster? What if my
 building burns down? Where can my employees perform their work and continue
 business operations?” You need to investigate whether your organization will invest 656 Chapter 12: Network Security



 in an additional work location, known as a site, in case the original office building
 becomes unavailable because of fire, flood, or an extended power outage.
 When deciding on an alternative location, or site, to continue business operations
 in the event of a failure, you must choose among a hot site, a warm site, and a cold
 site. Each site type is explained as follows:

 n Hot site A hot site is an alternative location that provides adequate space,
 networking hardware, and networking software for you to maintain business
 operations if disaster strikes. This hardware and software should include
 any data that would be needed by your staff in the event of a disaster, so the
 provider of the hot site should ensure that the data is up-to-date and the hot
 site is ready 24/7 if your organization needs it.
 n Cold site A cold site is an alternative location where you typically have
 arranged to have the space available but not the networking hardware or
 networking software. Providing the hardware and software would be your
 responsibility in the event of a disaster. A cold site takes time to prepare
 following a disaster because only the space is made available.
 n Warm site A warm site occupies the middle ground between a hot site and
 a cold site. It is an alternative location with office space and spare networking
 equipment, such as a server and backup devices, so that you can quickly
 restore your organization’s network in an emergency.

guidelines to Protect the network
 There are number of concepts that can be applied to your network to help secure the
 company and its data. This section is intended to provide a best practice guide to
 guarding your corporate investments. Although it is not designed to be a complete
 list, this section outlines common practices that should be followed to help create a
 more secure infrastructure.
 One of the most important things to understand about network security is that
 you should take a layered approach to securing network data. In other words, don’t
 focus too much on just one area of protection but implement all layers of protection. Guidelines to Protect the Network 657


Physical security
 Physical security plays an important role in any security plan. If someone can get
 physical access to a system, you can pretty much guarantee they will have access to
 the system. It is important that you take the necessary steps to ensure physical access
 to systems is controlled.
 The following is a list of physical security measures that should be considered:

 n Physical perimeter security In high-secure environments a fence is placed
 around the perimeter of the location and a guard at a gate are used to control
 who gets access to the premises.
 n Swipe cards Within the facility you can control access to different areas
 with swipe cards or keypad locks.
 n Locked doors It is important that critical systems be locked in a room and
 access to that room be controlled. Servers should be placed in a locked server
 room so that physical access to the server can be controlled.
 n CMOS settings You can change a number of CMOS settings on the system
 that deals with physical security. For example, you can ensure that the system
 cannot boot from CD-ROM. If someone can boot from CD-ROM, that
 person can load his own operating system and potentially bypass security.
 You can also disable ports such as USB ports in CMOS, which will ensure
 someone is not using a thumb drive to take data away.



firewalls
 One of the first things you should do to protect your network from attacks from
 the Internet is to make sure that you have a firewall between your corporate
 systems and the Internet. In addition, you should create a demilitarized zone
 (DMZ), which is an area on the network where you have selected certain data
 from the Internet to pass through and reach selected services, such as a web server.
 Figure 12-22 displays a DMZ created by configuring two firewalls; one firewall
 allows HTTP traffic destined for port 80 to pass through it, and the second firewall
 connects to the private LAN and allows no traffic to pass through it—essentially
 protecting internal resources. 658 Chapter 12: Network Security




 figUre 12-22
 Firewall Firewall
A DMZ is used HTTP
to publish servers Internet LAN
while maintaining
security through
controlled access SMTP
to those servers.
The DMZ is also DMZ
used to protect
the private LAN.




 When designing your firewall strategy, do not be afraid to create multiple layers
 of firewalls by using multiple firewalls and allowing certain traffic to pass through
 different resources. Also, when using multiple firewalls, be sure to use different
 vendors for each firewall so that if there is a vulnerability in a firewall and a hacker
 learns this and bypasses the security of the first firewall, the hacker cannot get past
 the second firewall using the same technique. For additional security, consider
 installing personal firewall software on every device on the LAN.


intrusion Detection systems
 As part of your security best practices you may look to install an intrusion detection
 system. As you learned in Chapter 3, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security
 device that monitors system or network activity and then notifies the administrator
 of any suspicious activity. The IDS is an important device to complement the
 firewall because it will notify you not only of suspicious activity against the firewall,
 but also of suspicious activity inside the network.
 There are two types of intrusion detection systems:

 n Host based Host-based intrusion detection systems monitor the local
 system for suspicious activity. A host-based IDS is typically a piece of software
 installed on the system and can only monitor activity on the system the IDS
 was installed on.
 n Network based A network-based IDS monitors network traffic for
 suspicious behavior. A network-based IDS has the capability of monitoring
 the entire network and comparing that traffic to known malicious traffic
 patterns. When a match is found, an alert can be triggered. A network-based Guidelines to Protect the Network 659


 IDS can be software loaded on a system that monitors network traffic, or it
 can be a hardware device.

 Intrusion detection systems can be either
 active or passive. An active IDS will monitor
 activity, log any suspicious activity, and then
 take some form of corrective action. For
 An active IDS is also example, if a system is doing a port scan on the
 known as an intrusion prevention network, the IDS may log the activity but also
 system (iPs). disconnect the system creating the suspicious
 action from the network.
 A passive intrusion detection system does not
 take any corrective action when suspicious activity has been identified. The passive
 IDS will simply identify the activity and then log to file any information needed
 during an investigation. The passive IDS does not take any corrective action.


Product Updates and service Packs
 A number of people believe that if they have a firewall they are safe from network
 attacks—a belief that most hackers hope for. The firewall can help protect us against
 data or services that we have not requested, but what about services that we ask for,
 such as e-mail? Hackers can attack the system by sending an e-mail that includes an
 attachment, hoping you open the attachment, which will then attack your system.
 This is why it is so important that you not open or run any program from an e-mail
 whose source you are not familiar with.

 It is important to note that most vendors, including Microsoft, will never send
 you an e-mail with an attachment to download. Microsoft has stated that
 they will send you the URL of a file and downloading it is up to you.

 I have received e-mails in the past that appeared to be from Microsoft asking
 me to run update.exe, which was attached to the e-mail. The hacker doing this was
 very smart, because the e-mail used the look and feel of the Microsoft site so that it
 appeared to actually come from Microsoft. The e-mail stated that update.exe would
 fix a security vulnerability within the operating system, but I knew better and did
 not run update.exe!
 An important part of securing your system is to make sure that you are constantly
 updating your virus definitions so that your system can protect you from any new
 known viruses. 660 Chapter 12: Network Security



 Along the lines of updating virus definitions, you will want to make sure that you
 keep up-to-date on operating system patches and product updates. For example, if
 you are running a Windows server along with Exchange Server and SQL Server, you
 must certainly test and apply any patches or updates for each of the products. This is
 a highly critical step to perform!
 About a year ago I was asked to do a security audit on a hotel. During the audit
 I plugged into a network jack that was available to guests in the hotel. Once I got
 the IP address, I typed a few Microsoft commands such as net view /domain and saw
 the domain for the corporate network! I also performed the kaht2 hack described
 in Chapter 11 on the server and was connected to the server instantly. So within
 45 seconds I went from knowing nothing about their network to potentially taking
 full control of it. Needless to say, the hotel failed the audit!
 The lesson here is that the network consultant who configured the network
 violated every best practice. First, the hotel guest network should never be
 connected physically to a corporate network. If there is a physical connection,
 there may always be a way to get access to the data. Second, the server was installed
 but had never had an update or patch applied to it! If the administrator had run
 Windows Update on the server, the RPC exploit would not have been successful.
 The bottom line here is that you must constantly update your antivirus software
 and apply any fixes or patches for your server operating systems and network
 devices. These fixes are provided because of flaws in the products, and hackers are
 aware of these flaws and use them to gain control of your network. Deny them the
 opportunity by taking the flaw away! Exercise 12-7 shows how you can delete a file
 from an unpatched Windows 2000 Server through what is known as the “dot dot”
 attack typed in the URL of the browser. What is important about this exercise is
 that a lot of people put their web servers behind a firewall and don’t bother doing a
 Windows update because they figure the system is secure behind the firewall. This
 attack shows you that the HTTP request will most likely pass through your firewall.
 You want to publish a web site, but because the system is not patched, anyone in the
 world can delete files on the server.


 exerCise 12-7

Understanding the importance of Patching a server
 In this exercise you will view the contents of drive C on an IIS 5.0 server that has
 not been patched, using the famous “dot dot” attack. You will then delete a file
 from drive C of the web server through the URL of a web browser. The goal of this Guidelines to Protect the Network 661


 exercise is to demonstrate how dangerous it is not to have up-to-date operating
 system patches on a server. This vulnerability in IIS 5 would not exist on a patched
 IIS 5.0 web server.

 Create a file on the Windows 2000 Web server

 1. On the Windows 2000 unpatched server double-click My Computer.
 2. Double-click drive C to open drive C.
 3. Choose File | New | Text Document.
 4. Type secret as the filename and press enter.
 5. You will need to know the IP address of your web server. Go to a command
 prompt, type ipconfig, and record the IP address of your web server in the
 space provided:
 _______________________

 Perform the “Dot Dot” attack from a Windows xP system
 6. Start Internet Explorer on the Windows XP system.
 7. Type the following URL to connect to your unpatched IIS 5.0 box to view
 the contents of the web server’s hard disk. The IP address of my server is
 192.168.1.201—if your IP address is different, you will need to replace the IP
 address in the URL:
http://192.168.1.201/scripts/..%c0%af.../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir+c:/ 662 Chapter 12: Network Security



 8. In the preceding figure, notice that you can see the file named secret.txt. Now
 that you have used the dir command through the URL, change the command
 to delete the c:/secret.txt file by changing the dir to a del command:
http://192.168.1.201/scripts/..%c0%af.../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+del+c:/secret.txt

 9. You get a CGI script error, but the delete operation has been successful. If you
 change the delete command back to the original command to do a dir, you
 will not see the secret.txt file anymore, because it has been deleted (as shown
 in the following illustration). You may need to refresh the page.




Hardening Devices and systems
 In regard to patching systems, you must also harden network devices and network
 servers. Hardening a system or a device is the process of removing unnecessary
 features that you are not using. For example, after installing a Windows 2000 Server
 you will notice that IIS is installed by default. You learned in the preceding exercise
 that anyone can delete files on your unpatched IIS 5.0 box. If you are not planning
 on hosting web sites on the server, you should uninstall the IIS service—this is the
 concept of hardening.
 Hardening an operating system or network device is a time-consuming process
 because you have to research the operating system or device and find out what
 software is installed by default. You then must verify whether you actually need that
 feature, and if not, remove the feature. This process involves a lot of paperwork, and
 you really must do your homework to determine what is needed and what is not;
 otherwise, you could cause the system or device to be dysfunctional by removing the
 wrong operating system component. Guidelines to Protect the Network 663


 Hardening a server and then applying any updates or patches to the server is
 a very effective method of securing the server. It is not the be-all and end-all
 of network security, but combined with firewalls and data encryption, it can
 go a long way to securing your environment.

 As part of your hardening practice, you will want to make sure that you have
 renamed any built-in accounts, such as the Administrator account. Once you have
 renamed the account, you may even create a new user account named “Administrator”
 and assign a really strong password to this account. The benefit is that a hacker who
 obtains the password for that account will only have “user” privileges on the system
 and also needs to figure out which of your accounts is the real Administrator account.
 In connection with passwords, you must also make sure that all accounts are
 using strong passwords. For more information on creating a password policy, refer to
 Chapter 10. To audit users’ passwords and be certain that their passwords are strong,
 you could use a password auditor such as LC4.


Data encryption
 In this chapter you have learned about various technologies used to secure network
 traffic, such as SSL for web traffic or IPsec for all IP traffic. If you want to make sure
 that a hacker cannot read the traffic on the network, you need to encrypt your traffic
 to protect its confidentiality.
 If you have a wireless network, you need to enable some form of encryption, such
 as WEP. Remember that WEP encryption has proved to be crackable; use it only if
 you don’t have another method of encrypting wireless traffic, but try to implement
 another form of encryption if possible.
 Another really important point to make about a hacker’s capturing network
 traffic is that on a wired network, the hacker must be connected to the network. If
 you enforce rules of physical security, you can protect network traffic. For example,
 many companies will not allow anyone with a laptop to connect to the physical
 network, because they know that a laptop connected to the network can run a
 number of security hacks and potentially yield access to corporate data.

 Make sure that you have a policy in place that limits who can connect to the
 network with devices such as laptops. You can enforce this by deactivating
 network ports until someone wants to use any of them. Even then, the user
 must be granted permission by management, and the port will be activated for
 only that MAC address. 664 Chapter 12: Network Security




vulnerability testing
 The last point I want to make about network security is that there are a number of
 vulnerability scanners available that can scan your network, making you aware of
 common security mistakes and unpatched systems. These vulnerability scanners can
 inform you of such things as

 n The number of network administrator accounts
 n Group memberships
 n Updates that have not been applied
 n Weak passwords used by user accounts
 n Common security practices not followed

 The foregoing list is a small example of the features available from vulnerability
 scanners, such as the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) or GFI’s
 Languard. You can download both of these tools from the following URLs:

 n MBSA www.microsoft.com/downloads
 n Languard www.gfi.com/pages/files.htm

 Languard is my favorite of the two and does a better security assessment of your
 network infrastructure. Languard reports a long list of items to you such as a list of
 user accounts, groups, permissions, open ports, services that are running, and missing
 patches. The benefit of a security scanner is that it can scan the entire network and
 report all of these issues to you in one screen—for all the systems on the network!
 Figure 12-23 displays Languard.

 To practice performing a vulnerability assessment with Languard, check out
ON THE CD
 Exercise 12-8 in LabBook.pdf on the CD-ROM.

 This section has introduced a few best practices relating to securing network
 resources. Network security is a huge topic and can’t be covered in just a few
 pages, so I hope that I have given you worthwhile information on just a few quick
 points. If you are interested in learning more on network security, one of the best
 books on the topic is McGraw-Hill’s Hacking Exposed, Sixth Edition (2009).
 I highly recommend it! Guidelines to Protect the Network 665

training and awareness
 One of the most overlooked security measures that can be taken within any
 organization is training and awareness. It is vital to the success of any security
 protection program that all employees within the organization are given seminars
 that make employees aware that their actions could cause security incidents.
 One of the best examples I can give is an employee password. Passwords should
 be changed frequently, and when they are changed, they should be strong passwords
 (mix of letters, number, symbols, and case). If I were the security manager for a
 company, I would ensure that all employees saw a demonstration on how easy
 a program such as LC4 can crack simple passwords, but at the same time have
 difficulty cracking strong passwords. This style of training and awareness will show
 the value of policies such as frequent password changes and the need for strong
 passwords. If we don’t make the employees aware, they won’t really care.
 There are a number of methods that you can use to train employees. The
 following are a few popular delivery methods:

 n Lunch and learn A popular method of raising awareness is to have small
 one-hour sessions during lunch hour. These sessions, termed lunch and learn,
 are typical short sessions focused on one topic. For example, today there
 may be a session on protecting passwords, while tomorrow the topic may be
 physical security. 666 Chapter 12: Network Security



 n Intranet site You could create training videos and post them on a intranet
 site for employees to watch. These are typically not as effective because you
 need to ensure you have control measures in place that ensure employees
 are watching the videos. You could also post documents on the intranet that
 explain security best practices.
 n Awareness seminars Instead of relying on lunch time, you could allocate
 time in the day for short awareness seminars. This is the same idea as the
 lunch and learn, but you are not using up the employees’ lunch time.
 n Training courses A training course is a longer version of awareness
 seminars and normally goes into a lot more detail. Typically the network
 administrators will need to be educated on how security compromises are
 happening and how to protect against them. These courses could range from
 three to five days in length.



network security audit Checklist
 As a network professional responsible for ensuring that network resources
 are protected, you may find it hard to keep up with securing all resources and
 implementing best practices. I have created a general network security checklist that
 you can use to audit the network and its servers. It is not designed to be complete,
 but it serves as a guide that you can build from. The checklist is also contained in
 the LabFilesChecklist folder on the CD that accompanies this book.

 In this chapter you learned some best practices for securing your network. It is
 important to remember to implement security in layers and not to rely on just one
 method of securing your systems. In this chapter you have seen the “dot dot” attack,
 which is launched by a hacker typing a URL into the web browser that navigates the
 folder structure on the server and can be used to delete files. This shows that if you
 were not patching the server but relying only on a firewall, you would be vulnerable
 to the attack.
 You have learned a number of operating system features that are used to secure
 systems, such as authentication and authorization. Authentication is the process by
 which a user presents logon credentials that are then verified by the network server
 against a database; if the credentials are correct, the user is allowed to access the
 network. After a user has been authenticated, an access token is generated that is
 used to authorize the user to access various network resources. A network resource
 uses an access control list to determine who is allowed access.
 A firewall is a device used for protecting one network from a second interconnected
 network, such as the Internet. Firewalls compare the data passing through them with
 rules set up to allow or deny access. There are several architectures for firewalls; three
 of them are dual-homed host, screened host, and screened subnet. A dual-homed host
 firewall has two network interfaces and acts as a gateway between the two networks. A
 screened-host firewall has a screening router placed between the public network and 670 Chapter 12: Network Security



 the dual-homed host firewall. This provides an additional level of security against
 outside intrusion. A screened subnet firewall, meanwhile, puts a screening
 router on either side of the firewall host. This provides protection on both sides
 of the host.
 Three firewall types are in use: packet-level firewall, application-level firewall,
 and circuit-level firewall. The packet-level firewall controls data at the network and
 transport layers. The type that works at the application level acts as a proxy and
 controls the top three layers of the OSI model. A circuit-level firewall works like
 an application-level firewall but operates at the transport layer. Additional security
 features have been added to firewalls to provide better service, such as support for
 VPNs and caching and better management tools. Proxy servers can also function as
 firewalls and can be used to enhance Internet access as well as function as firewalls
 by filtering ports.
 Data security has become increasingly important as networks are becoming
 interconnected. Data encryption provides a way to ensure that the data is kept
 secure. Encryption is the process of taking plain text data and converting it into
 a format that is unreadable. A key is used to encrypt the data and then to return
 the data to a readable format. Two types of encryption are in use: symmetric and
 asymmetric (public-key/private-key). Two common encryption methods include
 stream cipher and block cipher. Two standards for encryption have been accepted:
 the Digital Encryption Standard (DES) and RSA. Both use different methodologies
 and are in wide use today. Digital signatures can be used to verify that a message
 arrived without being tampered with. Digital signatures do not encrypt a message.
 Instead, they attach a signature that can be verified against a certificate authority.
 Windows 2000/XP/2003/2008 use certificates to encrypt files on an NTFS volume.
 You have learned a number of different disaster recovery concepts, including
 backing up data and storing a copy of the data offsite. You also learned that
 there are two types of spares for equipment such as hard drives or other network
 components—hot spares and cold spares. A hot spare is connected to the system and
 has power already supplied to the device so that if there is a failure in the original
 device, the hot spare can take over right away. The cold spare is typically close
 by but not connected to the system at the time of the failure. Because the spare
 is not readily available without any kind of changeover time, it will take longer
 to recover from the failure. You have also learned that companies serious about
 disaster recovery are likely to have an alternative location set up in case of a disaster
 affecting the original location. There are hot, cold, and warm disaster recovery
 sites. A hot site is a fully furnished site that has servers and a copy of the corporate Certification Summary 671


data ready to go in case of disaster. A cold site is a company just paying to have the
facility available; a warm site includes the facility with a server and backup devices
ready for the restore operation.
 You have also learned a number of guidelines used to protect the network, such
as patching systems and keeping them up-to-date and using firewalls to protect the
network and its data. It is extremely critical that you keep your knowledge up-to-
date about known vulnerabilities within the operating systems you are supporting.
Be sure to perform a vulnerability scan on your network frequently with products
such as Languard. 672 Chapter 12: Network Security




3 tWo-MinUte Drill
 Understanding attack types
 q Social engineering attacks are when the hacker tries to trick a person into
 compromising security through social contact such as an e-mail address or
 phone call.
 q Denial of service attacks result in the system crashing or being so busy
 servicing requests from the hacker that the system cannot answer requests
 from valid clients.
 q There are three main types of password attacks—dictionary, hybrid, and
 brute-force attacks.
 q Spoof attacks are when the hacker alters the source address to make the data
 look like it came from a different source. There are different types of spoof
 attacks—IP spoofing, MAC spoofing, and e-mail spoofing.
 q A buffer overflow attack typically results in the hacker getting shell access to
 the system with administrative permissions.

 Understanding system security
 q When a user logs on to the network, an access token is created that contains
 the user account and any groups the user is a member of; the token is then
 used to authorize the user to access resources.
 q Security descriptors are broken down into several components: the system
 access control list (SACL), the discretionary access control list (DACL), an
 owner, and a primary group.
 q The DACL is a list that shows the users and/or groups allowed to access the
 object as well as the level of permissions applied.
 q User-level security used in all new Windows operating systems allows
 administrators to select which users can access a resource and specify the
 permission they have.
 q Share-level security is available on client operating systems such as
 Windows 95 and Windows 98, which place a password on the share. Anyone
 who knows the password can access the resource. Two-Minute Drill 673


 q Share-level security is easy to implement and maintain on small peer-to-
 peer networks. However, users must remember the password for each shared
 resource.
 q You can secure the Registry for Windows systems by using regedt32.exe and
 setting permissions on different areas in the Registry.
 q Auditing allows you to monitor the security of the system and any
 administration activity performed.
 q A permission is a level of access to a resource, whereas a right is a privilege
 within the operating system to perform an operating system task.

firewalls and Proxy servers
 q A firewall protects the network by analyzing packets trying to pass through it
 and either allowing or denying the packet.
 q Traffic can be controlled through the firewall by building a firewall rule that
 specifies the traffic that can pass through by source, destination IP address, or
 port address.
 q A screened-host firewall places a router between the firewall and the Internet
 that filters and analyzes the traffic before it reaches the firewall.
 q A dual-homed firewall is made up of a computer with two network interfaces
 that filters traffic from one interface to the other.
 q A DMZ is a network segment that allows selected traffic through the firewall
 to the DMZ. The DMZ can host the web servers and the e-mail server for a
 company, but it does not host any private corporate servers—they are located
 behind an additional firewall.

securing Communication
 q Symmetric encryption uses the same encryption key for encrypting and
 decrypting traffic.
 q Asymmetric encryption uses a different key to encrypt from the one it uses to
 decrypt the traffic.
 q There are multiple methods of securing communication; you need to choose
 the best method for your situation.
 q Encryption can be defined as the process of taking plain text data and
 converting it to cipher text. 674 Chapter 12: Network Security



 q Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) allows for encryption of all data on an IP
 network by configuring an IPsec policy.
 q The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used to encrypt web site information
 transferred between a user and the web server (online credit card information
 is encrypted this way).
 q The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) and PPTP are VPN protocols
 that are used to encrypt traffic between a VPN client and the VPN server.
 q Kerberos is a distributed authentication security mechanism used by Windows
 2000/2003/2008 Active Directory for user validation.

 Disaster recovery and fault tolerance
 q Fault tolerance is a matter of ensuring that your systems will still function
 when a component fails, because you have another component ready to take
 over the work. RAID is an example of a fault-tolerant solution for your data.
 q Disaster recovery is the concept of ensuring that you can recover from any
 type of disaster by preparing for the disaster. You can prepare for disaster by
 building a disaster recovery plan, which contains step-by-step procedures for
 recovering a system from different failures.
 q You can create a disaster recovery alternative site for your organization. There
 are three types of alternative sites: hot, cold, and warm sites.
 q There are two types of spares when it comes to having standby components:
 hot spares and cold spares. A hot spare is a component that is connected and
 powered on, ready for failover; a cold spare must be powered up to be made
 available.

 guidelines to Protect the network
 q Place your web servers, FTP servers, and mail servers in a DMZ to protect
 them from the outside world.
 q Make sure that you patch all systems and devices. Patching a system or device
 helps remove known vulnerabilities from the system or device, which in turn
 helps secure it.
 q Review your firewall rules to be certain that you are allowing only needed
 traffic through the firewall. Two-Minute Drill 675


q Physically secure servers behind a locked door in a controlled-access server
 room. If a hacker can get physical access to the system, the system can be
 compromised.
q Encrypt the traffic of sensitive data so that it cannot be captured and analyzed
 by network intruders. You can use such technologies as SSL or IPsec to secure
 network traffic.
q Be sure to spend time hardening your servers. Hardening a server involves
 removing unnecessary services from the system. The less software running on
 the server, the fewer security holes.
q Make sure that you perform a vulnerability scan of the network with tools
 such as Languard on a regular basis. 676 Chapter 12: Network Security

self test ansWers

Understanding attack types
 1. þ D. Spoof attack is the term used for when the hacker alters the source address of the
 packet. There are different types of spoofing depending on what source address is being
 altered—IP spoofing, MAC spoofing, and e-mail spoofing.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. A buffer overflow attack is when too much information is sent
 to an application and as a result the hacker can run arbitrary code. A dictionary attack is a form
 of password attack using a word list file, and a social engineering attack is when the hacker calls
 or e-mails an individual and tries to trick them into compromising security.
 2. þ C. A hybrid attack, like a dictionary attack, uses a word list file but also tries popular
 modification on the words such as adding a number to the end of the dictionary word.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. A brute-force attack is when all the possible character
 combinations are calculated to try to figure out a password. A dictionary attack uses a word list
 file but doesn’t try variations of the word. There is no such thing as a buffer password attack.

Understanding system security
 3. þ A. The Local Security Authority (LSA) handles these functions above the Security
 Accounts Manager and Security Reference Monitor. Those services are used to provide specific
 functions for the LSA.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. SAM is a local database of users and groups. The Security
 Reference Monitor is used to validate a user right to perform a task and permission to access
 resources.
 4. þ D. The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) is the database of users and groups contained
 on a local Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional system.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. The LSA initiates the authentication process in Windows and
 validates against the SAM database. The Logon Process is applied to allow a user to log on and
 be verified. The Security Reference Monitor is used to validate a user right or permission to
 access resources.
 5. þ B. The discretionary access control list (DACL) determines which users and groups have
 permissions to an object.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. The SACL controls security auditing. The owner maintains
 ownership of the object, and a user is not a valid ACL object type. 682 Chapter 12: Network Security



 6. þ D. The Modify permission is the permission that allows a user to modify a file.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Read and Execute allow a user to read the contents of a file and
 execute a program from that location. Read allows the user only to read the file contents, and
 List Folder Contents allows a user to see the files that exist in a folder but not read the contents
 of a file.
 7. þ B. Authentication is the process of logging on to the network.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Authorization comes after authentication and involves
 determining whether a user can access a resource after being authenticated. Permissions and
 rights are methods of authorization.

firewalls and Proxy servers
 8. þ B. A firewall is used to secure the internal network from the outside world by rules
 configured on the firewall that specify which packets to drop and which packets to allow
 through.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Encryption converts plain text to cipher text. A router is used
 to provide routing functions to the network, but it may have firewalling features.
 9. þ A. A dual-homed host firewall contains two physical network interfaces.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because a screened-host firewall passes data through a screening
 router first and then onto the firewall. A screened-subnet firewall provides two screening routers
 with a firewall in between, providing an extra layer of security.
10. þ B and D. A firewall and two screening routers are required in a screened subnet
 configuration.
 ý A and C are not included in a screened subnet firewall configuration.
11. þ A. The packet level controls the network or transport layer within packets, creating rules
 that allow or deny traffic based on IP address (layer 3) or port number (layer 4).
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because the application-level type controls the layers above the
 transport level and the circuit-level type works at the transport layer.

securing Communication
12. þ C. In symmetric encryption both parties use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the
 encrypted data.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. Asymmetric encryption has two related keys—one is used to
 encrypt and the other decrypts. Self Test Answers 683


13. þ A and D. Stream cipher and block cipher are valid encryption methods.
 ý B and C are incorrect because data cipher and byte cipher do not exist.
14. þ A. The Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode encrypts each block individually, but the Cipher
 Block Chaining and Cipher Feedback modes do not.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because the Cipher Block Chaining and Cipher Feedback modes
 do not encrypt each block individually.
15. þ B. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) uses this algorithm.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because the RSA uses a different type of algorithm, and CPA
 and DSE are not valid encryption standards.
16. þ C. Digital signatures technology does not encrypt the message—it only verifies that it
 arrived without being tampered with.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because RSA is an encryption standard and the Local Security
 Authority is a Windows NT subsystem.

Disaster recovery and fault tolerance
17. þ D. A cold site provides only the disaster recovery facility. The equipment and data are the
 responsibility of the company using the facility.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. A hot site provides the facility and the equipment, and it will
 ensure that an up-to-date copy of an organization’s data is available in case of disaster. A warm
 site provides the facility and the backup equipment to perform a restore when needed. There’s
 no such thing as a blue site.
18. þ A. A hot site provides the facility and the equipment, and it will ensure that an up-to-date

guidelines to Protect the network
20. þ A and C. Languard and the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer are examples of
 vulnerability scanners that allow you to audit the network for security-related problems.
 ý B, D, and E are incorrect because they are not vulnerability scanners.
21. þ A. After installing the network operating system, you should harden the operating system,
 which involves removing unnecessary services. Removing unnecessary services helps secure the
 system, because each additional piece of software running provides more security holes for a
 hacker to find.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. You would not enable a firewall on the server because your users
 would then not be able to connect to it.
22. þ C. After hardening the operating system, you should patch the server to apply security fixes
 to any software running on the server.

 K nowing how to deal with network problems when they arise is one of the most
 important parts of operating a network. In this chapter you will learn a methodology
 to find and diagnose problems in a systematic and logical manner. Teaching that
 methodology is the goal of this chapter.




CertifiCation objeCtive 13.01


Managing network Problems
 Data communication is still not bulletproof. Many things can go wrong when you
 are networking several different types of computers, mainframes, printers, and
 network devices using different operating systems, protocols, and data transfer
 methods. When problems occur, you need not only an understanding of each of
 the devices on your network—but an understanding of the network as a whole.
 Learning how each device coexists with and contributes to the network provides
 you with a strong foundation for understanding how and why network-related
 problems occur and how to resolve them. For example, if you don’t understand how
 a router works, you will be quite overwhelmed when one segment of your network
 cannot communicate with another segment. If you have a very good understanding
 of routers and routing and one segment of your network cannot communicate
 with another segment, you will immediately know that there is a problem with
 routing—that, possibly, a router is malfunctioning. It is helpful to classify the types
 of problems you are having and to ask yourself questions concerning the problem in
 order to stimulate your network problem-solving abilities.


Does the Problem exist across the network?
 When you first encounter a problem, it is important to determine its scope. Does
 this problem occur with a specific machine, or does the problem exist across the
 network? You need to narrow the problem as soon as possible. If more than one
 computer is having the same problem at one time, it is obvious that you have a
 network problem, not a computer-specific one. This phase of the problem-solving
 process often requires you to check the status of other computers on the network to
 determine whether they are having the same problem. Managing Network Problems 687


 If you are having a network-related problem, the problem’s symptoms are helpful
 in determining its cause. In the example of one segment of the network not being
 able to communicate with another segment, you could quickly determine that you
 had a routing problem. Another symptom is that everyone on the coaxial-based
 bus network is unable to communicate. The cause of this situation is most likely a
 problem with the network bus backbone, which requires terminators on each end. If
 the network backbone becomes severed, the end points will not be terminated and
 the data will echo throughout the network, rendering the entire network unusable.
 Another symptom is that one department of the company on a twisted-pair Ethernet
 network can no longer communicate with the rest of the network. The cause is
 most likely a problem with the hub used to connect this group. As you know, a hub
 connects groups of computers. The hub itself is then connected to the network
 backbone, and in this case, the connection to the network backbone from the hub
 might have been severed.
 As you can see, quickly determining the scope of a problem is the first step in
 gathering information about the nature of the problem.


Workstation, Workgroup, Lan, or Wan Problem?
 To continue the discussion on determining the scope of a problem, larger networks
 present even more possibilities for error. Not only are you faced with computer-
 specific problems, but you can have problems within your workgroup, your local area
 network, or even the wide area network.
 For example, say that accounting department users employ a terminal-based
 order-entry system to transfer orders to corporate headquarters. This system operates
 through terminal sessions on user computers across the WAN to the corporate
 mainframe. One day the connection on a user’s computer is not working. How
 can you diagnose such a complicated issue? First, you need to determine whether
 the problem is occurring with a workstation, a workgroup, the LAN, or the WAN.
 You continue by going over to another computer and trying the connection. You
 find that this computer is having the same problem. Therefore, the problem is not
 computer specific. Luckily, the same order-entry program can be used to acquire
 the monthly sales orders from another terminal session, this time at the regional
 headquarters. You find that the user is able to connect to the regional headquarters
 mainframe with no problems. Therefore, you have proved that you can at least get
 out to another remote location, but you still haven’t determined the cause of the
 problem. 688 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 As it stands now, you could be having a routing problem with the corporate
 headquarters, a name resolution problem, or a mainframe connectivity problem.
 You can test the routing problem theory by trying to communicate with another
 computer on the corporate headquarters’ network. For example, you could ping
 another computer on this network by using the Ping utility and pass it the IP address
 of a system on the remote network. You receive a response from this computer. This
 response determines that you don’t have a routing problem to this remote network.
 Next, you get the IP address of the mainframe and attempt to ping it:
 Pinging 207.149.40.41 with 32 bytes of data:
 Request timed out.
 Request timed out.
 Request timed out.
 Request timed out.

 You have found your problem. The mainframe system at corporate headquarters is
 down. You’re sure that corporate headquarters is aware of the problem, so you decide
 not to pester them. You can check back every so often to determine whether the
 problem has been fixed. Luckily, it’s their problem, not yours!

 It is beneficial to know the IP addresses of some of the core servers on your
 network so that when you do connectivity testing with Ping, you will not need
 to dig up those addresses.

 See how quickly you can determine the scope of the problem? It took only a few
 minutes to determine whether you had a workstation, workgroup, LAN, or WAN
 problem. Unfortunately, all problems won’t be this easy to fix, but armed with the
 troubleshooting methodology presented here, you are on your way to solving any
 network problem that occurs.


is the Problem Consistent and replicable?
 Sometimes you are faced with weird problems that are not so easy to solve and
 require you to gain more information beyond the scope of the problem. You might
 already know you are having a LAN or WAN problem, for example, but you need
 more information to get you down the road to solving the problem. Next, you need
 to ask yourself, “Is the problem consistent and replicable?” To answer this question,
 you need to determine a way to replicate the problem. Managing Network Problems 689


 For example, let’s say that when someone in the purchasing department sends a
 job to the printer, it takes over five minutes for the job to print. As in the preceding
 section, we need to find out if more than one computer is having this problem.
 We send a print job from another computer only to discover that the print job
 once again takes five minutes to print. We now have a consistent problem that is
 replicable. The problem is not computer specific because we were able to replicate
 the problem on another computer.
 When we take a look at the print server’s health we notice that its processing
 power and memory utilization are high—we need to know why, but at least we have
 found the source of our problem. Chances are, if we can free up system resources we
 will have a better performing print server.
 Once again, notice how quickly we narrowed the problem to a possible source.
 Furthermore, notice how we used logic to determine the cause of the problem. We
 went to the next logical source in our printing problem—the print server. We didn’t
 immediately go to the router and check to see whether it was routing correctly,
 and we didn’t go to the domain controller to check whether the user had rights to
 print to this printer. We used logical troubleshooting methodology to arrive at the
 solution to the problem.


standard troubleshooting Methods
 As you learned in the preceding section, it is important to isolate the subsystem
 involved with a problematic process. When you work with a problem internal to one
 computer, you learn to isolate the subsystem involved. For example, say that your
 system is not detecting your primary hard drive. What subsystem do you check? You
 check the disk subsystem, which includes the hard disk drive, the drive controller,
 and the drive cable. You wouldn’t begin your troubleshooting by removing the video
 card and the CD-ROM drive.
 You must apply this methodology to solving network-related problems as well. In
 the preceding section, you knew you had a printing problem, so your troubleshooting
 remained focused on the printing subsystem; you tracked the problem by following
 the flow of information. You would have been led to a problem outside the printing
 subsystem if you researched the problem and found out that everything you did on
 the network, not just printing, took five minutes.

troubleshooting network Problems
 When you are troubleshooting network problems, it is important to follow a logical
 troubleshooting methodology. Always assume that the problem is a simple one. It
 might sound counterintuitive, but the simple solutions are most likely to elude you.
 As your experience grows, you can easily find yourself caught in a web of always
 assuming that the problem is more complicated than it actually is. When that
 happens, it can result in an excessive waste of troubleshooting time. Don’t forget to
 ask yourself three basic troubleshooting questions:

 1. Did the device ever work?
 2. When was it last known to be working?
 3. What has changed since then?

 Remember this: As an administrator, you are a “doctor.” Your patients are
 computers and networking equipment. As with any doctor, your first step to
 finding a cure is making a proper diagnosis. Use logic and the scientific method,
 and do not forget to use one variable at a time. To put it in plain English: fix one
 thing at a time!
 Always remember to start with the simplest things before checking the more
 complicated items. Most of the time, the problem is caused by something simple. It’s
 easier to check simple items than complicated ones, and doing so can save a great
 deal of time. Complicated items can take hours to check, whereas simple items can
 take only seconds or minutes. A process you can follow to help you troubleshoot a
 problem is presented in the eight steps to troubleshooting that follow:

 1. Identify the symptoms.
 2. Identify the affected area.
 3. Establish what has changed.
 4. Select the most probable cause.
 5. Implement a solution.
 6. Test the result.
 7. Recognize the potential effects of the solution.
 8. Document the solution. Troubleshooting Network Problems 691


 Before we continue, let’s look more closely at the steps to determine the
 symptoms and causes of a problem and the process of solving the problem in more
 detail. First, identify the symptoms. Doing so allows us to know the exact effects the
 problem is causing. You’ll use this information later to determine that the problem
 has been resolved, because these symptoms will disappear. For example, we need
 to know what the network users are experiencing—whether this is a matter of not
 being able to connect to a specific server or to all servers.
 Second, determine which areas of the
 network are affected. For example, you need
 to determine whether the problem affects all
 systems on the network or just a selected group
 Be sure to be familiar with of systems. No matter what, the affected areas
the eight steps to troubleshooting in the will always have something in common. This
preceding list for the Network+ exam. “something” could, of course, be the entire
 network, but that is something that the affected
 components have in common.
 Third, identify any differences between the affected areas and the unaffected
 areas by determining what has changed since the last time there were no
 problems. For example, if you are unable to get a network connection with all your
 workstations that are connected to a thinnet coax cable, but all other workstations
 are functioning, it’s more than likely that your problem resides in that thinnet
 coax cable.
 Fourth, after narrowing down the list of effects caused by the problem,
 pinpointing the scope of the problem, and determining what has changed, we can
 then most likely come up with a few things to check. We choose the most probable
 problem and determine a solution. For example, if we have a whole segment of the
 network unable to connect to the server even though all other users can connect
 to the server, we know we have an issue with a specific segment. We can then say
 that the segment has been disconnected from the rest of the network.
 Fifth, once a specific problem has been determined, we need to find a solution
 to that problem and implement that solution. For example, in the previous step we
 had a segment that was unable to connect to the rest of the network. If we think
 the problem is that the segment is disconnected from the rest of the network, our
 solution is to reconnect the segment.
 Sixth, once we have implemented a solution, we need to verify that the problems
 we found in Step 1 have all disappeared. For example, we could go back to the PCs
 that could not contact the server and make sure they can do so now. 692 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 Seventh, we need to make sure that our solution will not cause other problems.
 One thing that a technician or administrator needs to realize is that at times
 there could be multiple solutions to a single problem. Some solutions could cause
 other problems. For example, when installing service packs on a NOS, you need
 to determine which items the service packs will fix. You might have previously
 circumvented a problem on the server with a fix that the service pack will undo and
 cause a problem again.
 Finally, you need to document the solution you implemented. This information
 will assist others working with you and those who might take your place someday so
 that they can fix the problem, benefiting from your experience rather than having to
 perform all the same troubleshooting routines and waste a lot of time trying to arrive
 at the same solution.
 Subsequently in this chapter you will learn about the various tools available for
 diagnosing and correcting network problems.


identify the symptoms
 Identifying the symptoms is always the first step to resolving a problem. Whether
 you are an administrator or a technician, this part is usually the easiest. This portion
 of the problem-solving process is usually brought to your attention by network users.
 They will contact you and tell you what they are experiencing, but you need to be
 careful about taking at face value what they say about the effects they are seeing.
 Sometimes people who have little or no technical knowledge about computers
 and networks give explanations for the problems they are experiencing that are
 completely opposite to what is really occurring. Always remember that user error is
 always a possible cause of the problem.
 Working at a help desk can be difficult because most situations require a person
 to actually see the problems to be able to determine and the scope of the issue
 and possible solutions. Some help desks are set up to assign problems to a specific
 technician. For example, I once received a call from a user who could not access the
 server. The user’s explanations were that the PC was disconnected from the network
 or the server was down. I was able to determine that the server was online and running
 fine, but after looking at the user’s PC, I found out that the user had not logged on
 to the network. The user had been using Windows 98, which allows you to press the
 escape key at logon and have access to the local computer only. This was no real
 network issue, just an issue of the user’s failing to properly log on to the network.
 Once someone is present to see the problem, the user needs to make sure that the
 problem still exists and that the problem is a network issue and not a user error. A Troubleshooting Network Problems 693


 technician or administrator should try to see the problem first-hand to make sure the
 information she was given about the problem is correct.


identify the affected areas
 Once you have found the exact issues that are occurring as a result of the problem,
 you need to find out how many and which users are being affected. This step not
 only helps you determine the scope of the problem so that you can narrow it down
 to specific segments or devices—it also enables you to determine the priority to
 place on the issue.
 Sometimes this portion of the troubleshooting process allows you to find the
 problem’s source, especially if it is something like a failing router or a broken hub.
 The scope of the issue can point to the exact cause of the problem, because the
 affected area will be controlled by a single network device or cable.
 Knowing the scope of the problem will let you determine its priority and how
 long it can wait to be fixed. This is important when there are other problems that
 need to be considered—you need to fix the crucial problems first.

 same Line, Different Computer
 One method to isolate the network problem is to replace the problem workstation
 with a workstation that is known to be working. You could even use a laptop in
 place of the workstation to verify the connections, since a laptop would be easier to
 carry around. If the workstation or laptop that is known to be good has difficulties,
 the problem cannot be isolated to the original workstation. You should then begin
 troubleshooting network components such as the cable, hub, repeater, or network
 backbone, because the problem is not computer specific.

 same Computer, Different Line
 In a similar method, the workstation having difficulties is moved to another line. If
 the workstation is able to function correctly in the new line, the problem is on the
 original line, not with the workstation itself. This method can also be tested using a
 network cable from a workstation that is close by without having to move any PCs.
 Technicians should always try to carry an extra patch cable that can be used to swap
 with the existing cable to make sure that that cable is not bad and that the wall
 jacks are all working. This can be done easily if you carry a laptop in a case and place
 the extra patch cable in a pocket of the case. 694 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 swapping Components
 Swap the components that are between the failing workstations. These components
 include hubs, cables, and terminators—anything that could possibly go bad. This
 is a quick way to return the network to a functioning state. After the network is
 functioning, you can test the components that were replaced to determine which
 component failed. A lightning strike or some other type of electrical problem can
 sometimes cause a NIC to behave unpredictably. By swapping components, you can
 solve this problem quickly and efficiently.

 isolating segments of the network
 You will want to review the network to find out what areas are affected by the
 problem. With today’s networks it is fairly straightforward to isolate the network in
 the sense that you normally just have to unplug one cable to disconnect an entire
 segment. If you are using a thinnet coax network, isolating your network is easy.
 Simply choose a workstation to act as the dividing line for the isolation. Next,
 unplug the network cable from the T-connector and replace it with a terminator.
 You have now quickly isolated the network trouble.

 Table 13-1 shows you the steps you should take to diagnose and isolate network
 problems.

establish What Has Changed
 Establishing what has changed since the last time all components worked correctly
 can be an important step, depending on the problem. In some situations, this
 step may not have any bearing on the issue. On the other hand, if something has
 changed recently and everything worked before the change, you know the change
 has possibly had an adverse effect.
 This is the step that will help determine the problem that has occurred when a
 network device has been reconfigured and the settings are not the same as before.
 For example, let’s say that a network printer has its network interface card replaced
 and the new card is not given the same IP address as in the previous configuration.
 This mistake will prevent anyone who could previously print from printing.
 This step can also point to server upgrades not only of hardware but of software—
 drivers, software patches, and even application installation. Settings can be
 overwritten on the server, .DLL files can be replaced or removed, and many other
 things can happen to cause adverse effects for users.
 This step can be easily determined from documentation maintained by the
 network administrators and technicians. If a problem arises that is affecting a large
 number of network users or whole segments of the network, you can check the
 documentation and see whether anyone has made any major or minor changes to
 network devices or servers.


select the Most Probable Cause
 Once they’ve reached this point, most technicians and administrators formulate
 a few ideas as to the problem that has occurred and what caused it. There is no
 definitive manual to assist anyone in determining a problem’s cause from a given set
 of issues; this kind of insight is mainly gained from experience. The more issues you
 resolve, the easier this step will be for you.
 Selecting the most probable cause not only draws on your knowledge of networks
 in general, it also draws on your knowledge of the specific network you are working
 on at the time. Most employers do not realize that being onsite full time helps
 technicians or administrators know and understand their specific network better
 than a technician brought in from a computer repair shop. You can draw on past
 experiences and be able to determine the causes of problems that might be similar
 to other problems you’ve solved in the past. If a technician is around a network long
 enough, he or she will know the ins and outs of the specific network and be able to
 notice a problem before it becomes too major and thus noticeable to users.
 If a technician or administrator has not formulated any ideas about the problem
 by this point in the problem-solving process, he or she will at least have an idea 696 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 where to look or whom to ask. This type of knowledge can be as important as
 determining the cause of the problem itself. If you have no idea of the cause, you
 need to have a backup way of determining the cause.


implement a solution
 As noted in the preceding section, an administrator or technician will have an
 idea as to a problem’s cause and will most likely also have a solution or multiple
 solutions in mind to solve the problem. Again, this step comes with experience and
 knowledge.
 You not only need to determine the problem’s cause, you also need to come up
 with a solution that might or might not be easily known. You might need to consult
 other people on how to fix the problem, requiring access to the Internet or technical
 support telephone numbers for specific manufacturers.
 Once you have a solution in mind that seems as though it will fix the problem,
 you need to implement the solution. Again, you might not be able to implement the
 solution in a timely manner, since the problem could be of low priority.


test the result
 Testing the result of your solution is a more important step than the previous
 ones. Still, some technicians and administrators forget to take this step when
 troubleshooting problems. There is nothing more frustrating to a network user than
 contacting a tech support person to fix a problem and have that person arrive to
 say that the problem has been fixed; but instead of testing the solution, the support
 person leaves the user’s office. The network user then resumes work and finds that
 the problem still exists.
 Once you have implemented a solution, make sure that you return to the user to
 attempt to perform the task that was exhibiting the problem and make sure that the
 problem no longer exists.


recognize the Potential effects of the solution
 Once you have implemented and tested the solution, you need to make sure that the
 solution has not adversely affected anything else on the network. In some cases, you
 should consider this step before implementing the solution.
 In some cases, when a service pack or patch is installed, certain .DLL files that
 are used by other programs could be overwritten; as a result, existing software may Troubleshooting Network Problems 697


 not be able to run. Installing software such as service packs often enough leads to
 compatibility problems with other software on the system, which is why you want to
 be sure to test the new addition before implementing it in production.
 Once you fix a problem via a solution and have tested that solution, make sure
 you test other network issues that could be affected by the fix. For example, if you
 make a change to a router’s configuration, make sure that you do some testing from
 all segments of the network that are joined by the router and verify that a change to
 the routing table has not affected traffic flow from functioning network segments.


Documenting the solution
 The final and most important step in the troubleshooting process is documenting
 the solution. This step helps avoid wasted time later on as you or someone else tries
 to resolve the same problem, going through all the steps you have already performed
 to arrive at the same solution.
 Every help desk technician and administrator needs to have some type of database
 to store all the problems and solutions that are found. In a company in which all
 hardware and software are standardized, the same problems can keep recurring. If
 time has passed since the last time you solved a particular problem, you might not
 remember the solution and would have to perform all the same steps again. Or a
 problem could be sporadic, appearing only every few months. Keeping up-to-date
 documentation helps you be sure of the solutions you have tried so that you do not
 implement that same solution multiple times with no effect.
 Documentation is also important for anyone who is hired later to assist or replace
 you. If you are on vacation and return to find that your assistant has spent a week
 trying to solve a problem for which you already found a resolution months ago, you
 will not be too happy (and neither will your assistant). Other work has been put
 aside in favor of working on a problem that’s already been solved.


sample troubleshooting situations
 To follow up on the troubleshooting steps, let’s look at an example of network issues
 and the troubleshooting steps you can use to help you diagnose the problem.
 In this example, you get a call from a network user who says she cannot print
 to the laser printer in her department but has no problem accessing the servers or
 any other PC. She was able to print to the printer yesterday but is unable to print
 to it today. In fact, no one in the department is able to print to the printer, which
 is a network printer. The user verifies that the printer is turned on; she has even 698 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 powered off the printer and turned it back on. No error messages are displayed on
 the front panel. What do you do?
 The first step of troubleshooting is to identify the symptoms, which have just
 been reported by your caller. The second step is to determine the affected area; in
 this case, the whole department that uses the laser printer is affected.
 The third step is to determine what has changed. You would consult the
 documentation of what has been performed on the printer or the print server from
 the time they worked yesterday. While searching, you might find that the network
 interface card in the printer was changed at the end of yesterday. You check the
 printer and determine that the NIC was improperly configured.
 In Step 4, you would determine that the most probable cause of the problem is
 that the NIC was not configured correctly, so it cannot be contacted by the print
 server to receive print jobs. You may also determine that the TCP/IP settings on the
 network card of the print server are configured incorrectly. You need to be open to
 all possible causes of the problem.
 For a solution in Step 5, you would want to configure the NIC correctly. After
 consulting the documentation for the printer configuration, you change the settings
 as they should be to allow proper connectivity. If you had determined that the
 IP address settings were incorrect in the preceding step, you would configure the
 addressing information correctly in this step.
 For Step 6, you would test the result by waiting to see whether the print jobs that
 have been sent to the print server will start spooling to the printer. After about a
 minute, the printer starts printing all the spooled print jobs.
 Step 7 would dictate that you determine any adverse effects, but if there
 were none before the NIC was changed (except the problem for which the NIC
 configuration was corrected), all should be fine.
 The last step is to add to the printer’s documentation that the configuration was
 done improperly and has been redone. You might also document the correct settings
 once more to make sure that this problem does not occur again.

system or operator Problems
 In some cases, it is very clear whether a system or operator error has occurred. A
 system error can be classified as an error on the part of a computer or network device
 or process that was not associated with a user’s direct actions. This error can be a Checking Physical and Logical Indicators 699


 result of hardware failure or of something involved in the process of transferring
 or manipulating data. An operator problem is the result of a user’s action, such as
 not logging on correctly, connecting to the wrong server, or printing to the wrong
 printer. The sources of most operator-related problems are obvious. However,
 operator problems can stem from misconfiguration of a device, program, or service
 by the initial operator—the network administrator. If a device is misconfigured, it
 might not be apparent until the device is promoted to a production area and fails
 in the process. For the Network+ exam, you need to understand the various ways a
 system or network device error occurs, the symptoms of such an error, and how to go
 about resolving the problem. First, you need to learn the areas that will provide you
 with a clue as to the problem’s nature.



CertifiCation objeCtive 13.04


Checking Physical and Logical indicators
 When you begin troubleshooting a network-related problem, several indicators can
 help you determine the problem. These indicators are a combination of physical and
 logical elements. From a physical level, you can determine many things about the
 nature of the problem from the device in question by looking at its various indicator
 lights, error displays, and monitors. Let’s look at these tools now.


Link Lights
 Link lights are invaluable in determining whether a network connection is present. A
 link light is a green or amber light-emitting diode (LED) that shines if the networking
 device detects a network connection. Many network devices, such as routers, switches,
 and network cards, are equipped with link lights for this very reason. Most network
 cards have two lights—a link light, which
 remains on while there is a physical network
 connection, and a light that displays the current
 activity of the network card and pulses as data is

 definitely appear on the Network+ exam. Link lights on some network connectivity devices
 (e.g., switches) won’t light up if the wrong type of 700 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 cable is plugged in (e.g., crossover cables are sometimes required to cascade switches
 together). If you are troubleshooting a network-related problem, it is best to start
 by examining the device’s link light to determine whether a network connection is
 detected.


Collision Lights
 Troubleshooting network issues can also be determined by collision lights on a hub.
 Collision lights show whether a specific connection is having problems caused by
 packets colliding with one another. Collision lights can sometimes be the same as
 activity lights; the activity light is green when sending or receiving data and turns
 yellow or orange when a collision occurs.
 A collision results in the loss of the packet being received and the packet being
 sent. Sometimes a faulty cable or hub can cause packets to be generated from other
 packets or electrical interference. Sometimes called chatter, these disruptive packets
 can cause major collisions and can even halt an entire network due to collisions of
 all packets. Administrators and technicians need to watch these lights to verify that
 network chatter is not occurring.


Power Lights
 Even more rudimentary than the link light in the network troubleshooting area is
 the power light. Simply put, absence of a power light means no power is present in
 the device or the power light is burned out. If the power light is not present, check
 that the device is receiving proper power. If it is not, you should check the power
 supply, the power cable, or the wall connector. If you have verified that all these are
 working, the device could literally be dead. In this case, you will have to replace it.


error Displays
 An error display is a means of alerting you to a malfunction or failure in a device.
 This display can be a visual error dialog box on a computer when the error occurs or
 an LED error display on a network device. Such error messages should describe the
 problem that is occurring; however, they might not provide the necessary course of
 action required to solve the problem.
 The error display might refer to an error code that you must look up in order
 to determine the cause of the problem and the ways to resolve it. Referring to
 documentation for the device is helpful when you’re troubleshooting a network Checking Physical and Logical Indicators 701


 device, because each manufacturer has its own special procedure to resolve a
 physical or logical problem. Sometimes you must check the error codes on the
 manufacturer’s web site because they cannot easily or immediately be deciphered.


error Logs and Displays
 Similar to the error display is the error log, which maintains a listing of errors
 encountered on a device. This error log should contain the time the problem
 occurred, the nature of the problem, and quite possibly the procedure for resolving
 the problem. Unfortunately, error logs usually don’t contain enough information to
 solve a problem, and you must consult documentation to diagnose and resolve it.
 However, error logging is important because it can help you determine when the
 problem occurred, what might have caused the problem, and what other processes
 are affected by this problem. Often, error displays give a visual alert of the problem
 and log the error into the error log for future reference. Many entries in the error log
 are not critical-stop errors. Some entries are warnings that do not currently indicate
 a problem but are worthy of your attention. Other entries, such as those indicating
 when the computer was restarted or when a service started or stopped, are purely
 informative.
 Windows-based operating systems such as Windows clients and Windows
 servers each have an error log mechanism called the Event Viewer that is critical
 to the diagnosis and resolution of problems within those operating systems. It is
 recommended that you consult the Event Viewer during the troubleshooting process,
 watching for the critical, red-X error entries that have occurred.
 The Event Viewer is an application that reads the binary log files stored in the&lt;windows directory&gt;system32config folder. You will not need to go to the config
 folder to view the logs because the Event Viewer console retrieves the information
 from the files located in that folder for you. There are three main types of logs within
 the Windows-based operating systems that you should monitor on a regular basis:

 n The system log Records events that are provided by the Windows
 operating system and contains error messages that typically deal with device
 drivers failing to load, services failing to start, or general information about
 something that happens within the OS, such as purging a printer.
 n The security log Contains all security-related events when auditing has
 been enabled. If you have audited events such as the failure to log on, success
 or failure to access a file or folder, or the success of account management, this
 is where that information would be recorded. 702 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 n The application log Contains events that have been generated by
 applications that run on top of the operating system. For example, if you
 install SQL Server or Exchange Server on the system, those applications
 typically record their errors in the application log.

Checking event Logs
 If you are having a problem with a Windows 2000/XP/2003 system, you can view
 one of three logs depending on the type of problem. This exercise will show you
 how to view the system log for problems with the Windows Server 2003 network
 operating system.

 2. Expand out the Event Viewer by clicking the plus sign (+) to the left.
 3. To view the system log, click system on the left side. You can see the
 contents of the system log on the right-hand side (as shown in the following

 (yellow triangle), and information (blue i) events. Checking Physical and Logical Indicators 703


 4. To investigate a warning or error, double-click the entry to view the details.
 5. A dialog box opens and you will need to try to decipher the information
 presented. Notice that you can see the date and time the event happened at
 the top of the dialog box, and you can see an error message at the bottom of
 the dialog box (as shown in the following illustration).




 6. Once you see the error message, you can close all the windows and start
 fixing the problem.



Performance issues and optimization
 There are a number of terms in the Network+ objectives that you need to be familiar
 with that deal with network performance, bandwidth, and availability. This section
 will introduce you to those terms and also give you a tour of two popular network
 troubleshooting tools. 704 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network

 engineer will need to ensure that enough
 bandwidth is available to those applications
 in order for them to function correctly.

 traffic shaping
 Traffic shaping is when the network administrator controls network traffic in order
 to reach a desired level of performance on the network. With traffic shaping, the
 network administrator will delay packets for delivery according to certain criteria,
 such as the type of traffic, which then leaves the bandwidth available for mission-
 critical applications.

 Caching engines
 A caching engine is another method to optimize traffic. When you add a caching
 engine device to the network, it will download content from the Internet and store
 it in memory for other clients that request the same content.
 You can purchase such a device from Cisco. When you use the caching engine,
 you need to configure the router to forward the request to the caching engine first so
 that the engine can decide if a trip to the Internet is required or if it already has the
 content cached. Checking Physical and Logical Indicators 705


 Performance Monitoring
 There are a number of tools that you can use to monitor network and server
 performance. Two of the most popular tools in the Windows environment are
 Network Monitor to monitor network traffic and the Performance Console to
 monitor the health of a system.

 network Monitor Network Monitor is an outstanding tool for monitoring net-
 work activity and troubleshooting network performance. If you are troubleshooting
 communication problems and you need to see the details of the packets, Network
 Monitor is your tool. Network Monitor, which comes with the Windows operating
 system, only captures and displays the frames that are sent to or from your system.
 It does not monitor your entire network segment as does the version of Network
 Monitor that comes with Microsoft’s Systems Management Server (SMS). Switched
 environments usually require configuring traffic from all ports in the switch to be
 mirrored to a specific port where the administrator is running Network Monitor;
 otherwise, the administrator is capturing only traffic sent and received through the
 port the administrator is plugged into.
 You have used Network Monitor (shown in Figure 13-1) at different points in
 the exercises throughout this book to analyze network traffic, so you have seen how
 powerful a tool it is to help you understand and troubleshoot network problems by
 displaying the contents of packets running on the network.


 figure 13-1

Looking at
network traffic
with Network
Monitor 706 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network




 To monitor network traffic you can use a tool such as Network Monitor
 when troubleshooting connectivity problems, or Wireshark, which is a free download.


 system Monitor Another useful tool is the Performance Console in
 Windows XP, 2003, and Windows 2008. System Monitor (seen in Figure 13-2), a
 component of the Performance Console, is used to monitor the system’s health and
 to troubleshoot performance-related problems. You can use System Monitor for a
 variety of tasks, including the following:

 n Identifying bottlenecks in CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network I/O
 n Identifying performance trends over a period of time
 n Monitoring real-time system performance
 n Monitoring system performance history
 n Determining the system’s capacity
 n Monitoring system configuration changes

using system Monitor
When monitoring the system’s health, you are trying to determine why the system is
running slow. There are four areas of potential bottlenecks on a system:

 n Processor The processor may be overworked if you are running too many
 processes at the same time, or running processor-intensive applications. If you
 determine that the processor is being overutilized (typically above 85 percent
 utilization), you may need to upgrade the processor, add another processor, or
 enable processor hyperthreading (if your processor supports hyperthreading).
 n Memory You may notice that the system is getting sluggish because you do
 not have enough memory. If you don’t have enough memory, the system will
 be doing a lot of paging—that is, swapping information from memory to disk
 and then disk to memory; this puts a lot of workload on the system. To reduce
 paging, always add more RAM.
 n Hard disk The hard disk is another area of potential bottlenecks. Because
 the hard disk is servicing all requests for files on the server, you may want to
 make sure that you have a fast disk or multiple disks to service the request.
 n Network The network card is a potential bottleneck as well, especially on
 a network server, because it is answering all network requests for network
 resources. You should make certain that you have the fastest network card
 possible.

 When using System Monitor, you will be required to add counters to the
monitoring tool. A counter is an element of the computer that you want to monitor.
For example, a good counter to measure is percent utilization of the processor to help
you determine if the processor is being overworked. The percent utilization counter is
a characteristic of the processor object—an object is a component of the system, and a
counter is a characteristic of the object. You may add a counter to System Monitor by
right-clicking in the detail screen and choosing Add Counters as shown in Figure 13-3.
 When you click the + sign to add a counter, a dialog box appears asking you to
select the counter to add. When you add a counter, you can choose the object from
the drop-down list and then choose the characteristics of that object (as shown in
Figure 13-4). You will notice that there are hundreds of objects to measure, and as
you add more software to the system the list of objects will increase. For example, if
you add SQL Server to the system, there will be objects and counters to keep a close
eye on the health of SQL and your databases. 708 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network

 High-availability Concerns
 When dealing with networking applications such as web applications, e-mail servers,
 database servers, or even something as simple as a file share, you will want to look at
 ways to ensure high availability. High availability means that you are taking steps to
 ensure that the service is always available. There are a number of technologies that
 aid in high availability.

 High-availability Clusters Clustering is a popular high-availability solution.
 A typical example of a cluster has two servers in the cluster, each server called a
 node. One of the servers is called the primary node, while the other is the secondary
 node. The primary node is the server that is available, while the secondary node is in
 a standby state and is not used unless the primary server becomes unavailable.
 An example is your e-mail server. This is a critical service on the network, and
 users typically have fits of rage if the e-mail server goes down! Your job is to ensure
 e-mail is always available, so you install two servers in a cluster that is running your
 e-mail server software. Your e-mail server software is running on both nodes in the
 cluster with the e-mail data on a drive shared by both nodes.
 When the primary server fails, the secondary server automatically becomes the
 active node and can then service any request from clients wishing to access their
 e-mails. The clustering technology takes care of automatically detecting when the
 primary node fails and then making the secondary node the active node.

 Load balancing A very popular method of increasing performance of network
 resources, such as popular ecommerce web sites, is to load-balance the web site. Load
 balancing means that you will install the web site on multiple servers and then the
 requests for the site are distributed among all servers in the load-balancing solution.
 The load balance happens as the load-balancing software accepts the request and
 then uses an algorithm to decide which server to forward the request to. The benefit
 of a load balance is that if you have a large number of requests coming into the site,
 you don’t have one poor server that is bogged down with requests.

 fault tolerance We talked about fault tolerance previously in the book, and
 I just want to stress that high availability and fault tolerance are two totally different
 things. High availability is about ensuring the service is available, such as the e-mail 710 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 server, whereas fault tolerance ensures that the data the e-mail server accesses is
 available through data redundancy.
 If you implement fault tolerance without high availability, the e-mail data may be
 protected through fault tolerance, but if the e-mail service actually fails, then there
 would be no way to access the fault-tolerant data. High availability will ensure the
 fault-tolerant data is accessible by having a secondary server with the e-mail service
 running. This secondary server will come online automatically if the primary e-mail
 server fails.


Physical and Logical issues
 When it comes to troubleshooting networking issues, you will need to troubleshoot
 the physical aspects of the network such as devices and cables, but also the logical
 aspects of the network such as invalid IP address settings or VLAN issues. This
 section will identity different physical and logical issues you may encounter.

 Physical issues
 Most of the physical issues you will encounter deal with cabling problems. To solve
 cable connection issues, you will use the visual indicators mentioned earlier such as
 the link light and activity light.
 You may encounter a number of other issues that deal with cabling such as

 n Crosstalk Crosstalk is interference from adjacent wires. If you experience a
 lot of signal degradation, it could be due to crosstalk. To fix the problem, look
 at using another cable type that has more layers of shielding.
 n Attenuation Attenuation is the degradation of the signal as it travels
 great distances. If you find that you cannot communicate with a system
 that is quite far away, it is possible that you have exceeded the maximum
 cable length for that type of cable. You can put a repeater in the middle to
 reamplify the signal or use a different cable type.
 n Collisions If you find you have a lot of collisions on the network, it could
 be because you have too many systems on the network segment and may be
 using a hub device. Upgrade the hubs to switches because each port on the
 switch is its own network segment, meaning the data will not collide with
 any other data because it is the only system on the segment.
 n Shorts A short in the network cable could cause network downtime. When
 experiencing connectivity issues, use a cable analyzer to identify if there is a
 short in the cable. Checking Physical and Logical Indicators 711


 n Open impedance mismatch (echo) High impedance can cause signal
 bounce, which could cause communication issues. This signal bounce could
 be due to a miswired cable or an incorrect connector. Using a cable tester, or
 analyzer, will determine if there is connectivity between the two ends of the
 cable. If there is not, then you will need to recrimp the cable.
 n Interference You may receive interference from external components. Be
 sure to wire the network cable away from power cables and other interference
 sources.




 Cable disconnections, such opens. You can use a cable analyzer to
as when there is no connectivity between determine if there are opens on the
pins at either end of the cable, are called cable.



 Logical issues
 I find that most of the problems with networking deal with logical issues such as
 administrative errors when assigning IP addresses or placing a system in the wrong
 VLAN. The following is a list of popular logical issues that cause problems on
 networks:

 n Port speed and duplex settings If you have a problem with a system
 connecting to the network, double-check that the speed and duplex settings
 of the card are set correctly.
 n Incorrect VLAN It is possible that miscommunication is occurring if you
 place a system on the wrong VLAN. Remember that a system on one VLAN
 cannot normally talk to a system on another VLAN unless you are routing
 between VLANs.
 n Incorrect IP address One common logical issue is when the IP address of a
 system is typed incorrectly. When troubleshooting, check the IP addresses of
 all parties involved.
 n Wrong gateway If you have trouble communicating off the network, this is
 typically a routing issue. Check the default gateway settings on all the systems
 to verify they are pointing to the IP address of the router. 712 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 n Wrong DNS If you can communicate by the IP address but not the DNS
 name of a system, then you most likely have a name resolution problem.
 Check the IP address you have configured on the system as the DNS server
 entry.
 n Wrong subnet mask If you have the wrong subnet mask typed into the
 TCP/IP properties, this could cause miscommunication. When you check the
 IP address of a system, also verify that you are using the correct subnet mask.
 n Network loops Loops on the network will typically bring the network
 down. This is why Cisco switches use the STP protocol: it is a protocol that
 prevents loops by placing one of the ports in the loop in a blocking state.
 If you have intermittent problems with the network where systems seem to
 just lose connections, then it could be a loop issue. Check how you have
 everything wired and remove the cable that creates a loop.
 n Routing issues If you find all clients on the network cannot communicate
 with systems on another network, then you most likely have a routing
 problem. Check the routing table on the router and ensure there is a route to
 the network you are trying to reach.
 n Wireless issues There are a number of potential wireless issues. Your
 wireless client could have connected to the wrong wireless network
 automatically. Check to ensure that you are connected to the correct wireless
 network. If you are losing your wireless connection a lot, then you most likely
 are getting interference from cordless phones or the microwave.

network troubleshooting resources
 Once you have determined the cause of your network problems, the battle is only
 half over. You still have to figure out how to fix the problem. In many cases, the
 solution, such as replacing a bad cable, might be obvious. However, in other cases
 additional solutions could be required. Resources are available to help in your search
 for the solution to your problems. Let’s look at a few of those resources now. Network Troubleshooting Resources 713


technet
 TechNet is a Microsoft product that is distributed on a monthly basis to its
 subscribers. TechNet is a searchable database of all Microsoft’s articles and
 documentation on nearly all its products. Because there is a really good chance that
 someone else has already had the same problem that you are having, TechNet is
 likely to contain some documentation about how others have solved the problem
 that can help you solve yours. Microsoft has a version of TechNet online at
 www.microsoft.com/technet that you can visit and search for articles and consult a
 knowledge base for most of the problems you encounter with Microsoft products.


Manufacturer Web sites
 The World Wide Web has simplified network troubleshooting tenfold. The web
 enables us to find up-to-the-minute information on both hardware and software. If
 you are having a problem with a NIC that is not properly communicating on the
 network, a good place to start is the web site of the NIC’s manufacturer. Most sites
 provide troubleshooting information, suggested steps to resolve common problems,
 phone numbers with which you can contact technical support, and the latest updated
 drivers. Figure 13-5 illustrates the Microsoft Technical Support web site’s interface.


 figure 13-5

The Microsoft
Support web site 714 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network




resource Kits and Knowledgebase
 Resource kits provide a wealth of information about your operating system, including
 technical information that is not available anywhere else. Resource kits contain
 additional documentation on your operating system that is too comprehensive to
 cover in the standard documentation. Whenever you are faced with a problem that
 you cannot solve, check the resource kit’s knowledgebase articles—your problem
 could already have been solved.


trade Publications and White Papers
 Other excellent sources of information are trade publications and white papers.
 These documents provide valuable information on current techniques and new
 practices that cannot be acquired anywhere else. In the event of actual network
 problems, these publications will probably be of little direct use to you, but the
 information you absorb over time from reading them will become one of your most
 helpful tools.


telephone technical support
 Often, after you have exhausted your resources—vendor web sites, resource kits,
 and documentation—it is common to open up a technical support incident with
 the vendor to solve the problem. Who is better qualified to solve your problem than
 highly skilled technicians who work for the company that makes your equipment
 and who field similar requests on a daily basis? Chances are, the support personnel
 have already encountered the specific problem with their own software or hardware
 and have documented fixes. A problem that boggles you could be a very common
 tech support call for these professionals.
 To improve the speed and accuracy of your technical support incident, make sure
 you have the following ready to assist the support technician when you call:

 n Hardware and software environment information, such as the operating
 system you are running
 n Version numbers of affected hardware or software
 n Serial numbers
 n A detailed account of the problem Other Symptoms and Causes of Network Problems 715


 n Troubleshooting steps taken so far and their results
 n Contract number for your maintenance contract



vendor CDs
 Vendor-provided CDs that come with hardware and software are important
 references for installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. Many technicians
 overlook these CDs and spend countless hours troubleshooting on their own or
 head straight to the phone for technical support. These CDs should be the first
 consultation resource, even before the product is installed, because usually the CDs
 provide preinstallation tips and warnings that are critical for a smooth installation.
 A vendor-provided CD also can include a technical information base, similar to
 Microsoft’s TechNet, detailing a number of problems and their resolutions. Other
 CDs have tutorials, documentation, and software patches. Whatever these CDs
 contain, they should not be overlooked, whether you are planning to implement,
 support, or troubleshoot the product.

 problems and the appropriate solutions.

recognizing abnormal Physical Conditions
 The key to recognizing abnormal physical conditions on the network is knowing
 what a normal physical condition is. Such a condition could be different from one
 network to another. For example, it could take your network only three seconds
 to spool up a print document, but it could take another network one minute to
 spool up a document of the same size. This doesn’t mean that the second network
 has a problem; it could be merely a normal physical condition for that network.
 The following are things to look for when you attempt to determine whether an
 abnormal condition is occurring on your network:

 n Printing takes longer.
 n Authentication takes longer.
 n You are receiving more errors than usual.
 n Connecting to remote resources takes longer, if you can connect at all. 718 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 n You are losing connections to resources.
 n Network applications are not running.

 To determine whether these situations are abnormal occurrences on your
 network, you need to ask yourself a few questions:

 n How many users are affected by this problem?
 n Is the problem consistent?
 n Is the problem replicable?
 n Was there a recent upgrade to the network or computer?
 n Has any of the equipment been moved?
 n Have we encountered this problem before?
 n Has anyone else attempted to fix the problem?
 n How many applications is this problem affecting?
 n Are there new users or computers on the network?
 n Is this a busy or congested time of day?
 n Which products are involved?

 Your mind should be going at top speed, thinking of what could have contributed
 to the problem. With knowledge of what constitutes a normal network environment,
 you can determine rather quickly what is not normal.


isolating and Correcting Problems in the Physical Media
 Experienced network administrators know that cabling is one of the most common
 causes of network failure. For this reason, you should check cabling first during your
 network troubleshooting process. Most often the cable that is damaged is the cable
 from the workstation to the wall jack. This
 cable receives the most abuse. Sometimes you
 can fix the problem by simply plugging the cable
 back in, if it has become loose or fallen out.

 can communicate once again, the old cable was bad. If once again you cannot
 communicate, you need to continue troubleshooting or find another cable to test.
 There are devices you can use to determine whether cables have gone bad,
 but these devices can be expensive. Most of the time you can swap out cables
 to determine whether they are bad. Table 13-3 lists some common cable-related
 problems and their solutions.


Checking the status of servers
 Checking server status is critical because servers can be plagued with ongoing
 problems that are not so obvious, and if the problems are not corrected, they can
 become worse. There are many ways to continually monitor the status of your
 servers, and each is operating system–specific. Some general monitoring tasks are
 listed here:

 n Check error logs
 n Check services
 n Verify connectivity
 n Monitor the performance and the network
 n Verify backup logs, including test restores
 n Test alerts

 The error logs can give you an indication of a failed device or service and a good
 idea of how to fix the problem. The errors listed vary from critical to informational.
 Some errors, such as a service failing to start, warrant immediate action. A service
 failing to start can be critical, and it often has dependencies that require the running
 of another service to allow the services themselves to run.

 It is important to develop a maintenance plan for your network and to
 include in that plan daily tasks such as monitoring the event logs for potential
 problems. Make it part of your early morning or end-of-day routine.

 You can test for connectivity with a server using utilities such as Ping to
 determine whether the server is responding to network requests, and performance
 and network monitoring can determine whether the server is overloaded or is
 broadcasting unnecessarily. An overloaded server can increase the length of time
 needed to fulfill network requests.
 If you are backing up a server, which is always recommended, you need to verify
 that the backups have finished successfully. This is imperative, because in the event
 of an emergency you will need to recover data from the backup tapes. You must also
 do test restores to make sure that the data can be restored correctly and that you
 understand the restore process. A disaster is the worst time to discover that your
 backup routine hasn’t been working correctly.
 Finally, you can configure your server to send alerts to specific computers or users
 in the event of emergencies or when the system encounters thresholds that you have
 predefined. A threshold is a peak in the rate of activity, about which you would
 like to be notified so that you can correct the situation. Setting thresholds includes
 baselining your system so that you know the normal rate of activity.


Checking for Configuration Problems
 When you are bringing a new server online or configuring a server with a new
 service such as DNS or WINS, it is imperative that you begin by verifying that
 the configuration is correct. Sometimes you will incorrectly configure a server and
 it will continually deteriorate or it will not work at all. You must make sure that
 the base operating system, TCP/IP, networking, error logs, and memory allocation
 are configured correctly. You must also correctly configure the additional services
 that run on top of the operating system. You will frequently have an application or
 database server that also runs a backup service, such as ARCserve or Backup Exec. Other Symptoms and Causes of Network Problems 721


 When you are configuring the backup server, you might have to reboot the
machine for changes to take effect. This means downing a critical server for a few
minutes, thus breaking connections with all users and services that are currently
using that machine. You might have to do this during off hours; be very careful about
configuring services for mission-critical machines during business hours.

It is important to have a change log book beside the servers and to train your
network administrators to record any of their changes in the log book.This
will help you identify potential causes of problems by having a history of the
changes and who made them.

 It is important that the following services be correctly configured, because
they have the capability to affect the entire network, not just the local server—a
catastrophe waiting to happen. Most networking environments rely on one of the
services discussed in the following subsections.

Dns
DNS is now a requirement of most networking environments such as Microsoft
Active Directory and any Internet-based application. Configuring DNS for these
environments requires a great deal of planning. You need to gather the following
information prior to installing the service:

 n Your domain name
 n The IP address of each server for which you want to provide name resolution
 n The hostname of each server

 This information must be correct; otherwise, your network will experience
ongoing name resolution problems that will be difficult to diagnose. This is
especially the case with hostname–to–IP address mappings. DNS entries can be
entered manually, so you must be very careful not to enter a wrong IP address or
hostname. You will not be prompted with an error message informing you that you
have entered an incorrect IP address.

Wins
WINS is much like DNS in that it provides name resolution; however, DNS resolves
hostnames to IP addresses, and WINS resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
WINS does not require you to manually enter mappings before you begin—this
is because WINS is a dynamic service that can add, modify, and delete name 722 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 registrations dynamically, saving valuable time for the network administrator. At
 times you will want to add a static mapping for important clients or servers.
 WINS, like DNS, has many configuration possibilities. Although most WINS
 configuration parameters will not be covered on the Network+ exam, you will be
 required to know how to configure each client to point to the WINS server in a
 WINS environment.

 the Hosts file
 As you have learned, when you use DNS you must manually add hostname–to–IP
 address mappings in order to resolve hostnames. With the hosts file, you also have to
 manually configure a database with these exact mappings. Unlike DNS, which uses
 a centrally located database of hostname mappings, the hosts file resides on every
 computer. This makes the process of updating
 the hosts file very difficult. The hosts file is
 usually located under windowssystem32
 driversetc.
 Make sure that you All the DNS rules apply to the hosts file:

 Chapter 4. ensures that you don’t make any clerical errors
 on each of the remaining machines.


Checking for viruses
 If you have ever been a network administrator in the midst of a virus attack, you
 know how frustrating the situation can be. Once the virus gets in from the outside,
 whether from the Internet, a user’s home computer, or the local intranet, it poses
 a huge problem. But how can you eradicate the viruses before they come into the
 network? A server running a virus-scanning program can make all the difference in
 applying “preventive maintenance.”
 Many companies engage in multipronged attacks against viruses, including
 continually scanning for viruses on the file and messaging servers and installing
 virus-scanning software on every workstation. Both precautions are critical for
 stopping the spread of viruses. The server can catch viruses coming in from the Other Symptoms and Causes of Network Problems 723


 messaging servers, such as Microsoft Exchange, and from files stored on the file
 servers. The workstation virus-scanning programs can catch viruses on users’
 machines before the viruses get a chance to replicate to the servers and to other
 users’ computers on the network. In any case, the virus-definition files must be
 updated on a continual basis. Many virus-scanning utilities enable workstations to
 automatically update the virus definition files from a central server, which means
 you, the network administrator, do not have to visit every workstation once a month
 to apply the new definition files.


Checking the validity of the account name and Password
 Usually you configure services or applications to log on with a certain account in
 order to perform their functions. A number of services usually use the built-in system
 account, but if the service requires logging on to a remote computer, it requires an
 account name and password that resides in the network account database, such as
 Active Directory. Some services require administrative privileges or membership in
 certain groups on the network to accomplish their tasks, so you will need to make
 sure that the account a service is using is the correct account, has the appropriate
 level of rights, and is in the correct groups. You must document these special system
 and service accounts and remember not to delete or tamper with them in any way. If
 you mistakenly disable, delete, or affect the account details, you could find yourself
 with a service, or application, that fails to start—a problem that is often very
 difficult to diagnose.
 I have seen network administrators install applications and specify their own
 administrator account for the service to use. When the network administrator
 leaves the company, his account is disabled or deleted, and, mysteriously, some of
 the programs fail. If the other members of the department were not aware of this
 configuration, they could be scratching their heads for days wondering why this
 program or service does not work anymore.


rechecking operator Logon Procedures
 The most obvious problems often involve logging on. If a user mistakenly tries to log
 on to a network or domain in which he doesn’t have an account, he will be denied,
 and he will call you, the network administrator. Users often forget their passwords or
 the fact that the password is case sensitive. After three attempts (or however many
 times you have configured the system to accept guesses), the user is normally locked
 out and will need to contact you to re-enable the account. 724 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 Sometimes users return from vacation to find that their accounts have been
 disabled or their passwords have expired. You may need to reset a user’s password
 when he or she returns from vacation so that the user can access network resources.
 Figure 13-6 shows how to change the user’s password in Microsoft’s Active Directory.


selecting and running appropriate Diagnostics
 To build a strong network, you need to run diagnostics to search for bottlenecks or
 problematic situations. These diagnostics may reveal problems or limitations that
 you can fix before they get too bad.
 You need to choose diagnostic programs that correlate with your specific network
 needs. For example, you can purchase extensive protocol-analyzing and packet-
 sniffing products, but they would be overkill for a 20-node network. Often the
 free diagnostic products, such as Performance Monitor and Network Monitor, are
 capable of determining computer and network problems.
 Whichever tool you choose, you must spend plenty of time with the product to
 determine the most effective way to deploy it. You must also be trained to analyze the
 results and determine what needs to be adjusted in order to remedy the situation. It
 will take more than one trial to establish a reliable baseline of activity for your testing.

 For example, running a diagnostics or performance test at 8:00 a.m., when all the
 users are logging on, gives entirely different results from running the diagnostics at
 noon, when they are at lunch. Taking snapshots of activity from various periods of
 the day, week, and month gives you the most accurate assessment of your network.
 The longer you spend baselining your network, the more accurate the results. From
 there, you can begin assigning thresholds to chart and alert for abnormal activity.
 Furthermore, you are training yourself to read the various diagnostics so that you
 can quickly determine how, why, and where a problem is occurring. The following
 section gives more examples of devices that can help you troubleshoot your network.

network tools
 In most network troubleshooting sessions, there comes a time at which a simple
 isolation of problems is just not feasible. In that situation, it’s time to use some
 electronic tools to determine your problem and its source. This section discusses the
 most common network tools and how they are used.


Cable Crimper
 A tool that will prove to be useful from time to time is a cable crimper, like the
 one shown in Figure 13-7. A cable crimper should have the actual crimping tool to
 “crimp” or close the connector on the end of the cable, along with a wire cutter to
 cut the ends of the wire, and a wire stripper.


 figure 13-7

A network cable
crimper 726 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network




Cable tester
 You should also have some cable testers handy to help you determine whether the
 cable is crimped properly. A cable tester should have two parts to allow it to plug into
 each end of the cable, and it should have light indicators that light up as it tests for
 connectivity from one end of the cable to another on each wire (see Figure 13-8).
 The tester should have a light for each wire in the cable. The tester will light up
 an indicator for each wire, one after the other—you will need to watch the lights
 light up at both ends and make sure that the order is the same on both parts of the
 tester. If the order is different, you have an incorrectly positioned wire and you will
 need to re-crimp an end.
 A certifier is a type of cable tester that will report the same information as a
 normal cable tester, but will also report on data such as speed and duplex settings.


Crossover Cables
 A crossover cable appears to be just another twisted-pair cable, but two wires are
 crossed, which makes the cable not fit for plugging into a computer and a hub
 for normal use. The crossover cable is used to directly connect two computers to
 each other, without the use of a hub. This can be extremely useful when you are
 troubleshooting a system and want to have it disconnected from the network but
 also need to be able to connect your own system because it has diagnostic tools on it.


 figure 13-8

cable with a cable
tester Network Tools 727


 A crossover cable is also used to interconnect some hubs and switches. If you were
 to substitute a crossover cable for a regular twisted-pair cable to connect two hubs,
 it would not work correctly (there would be no link light for that port). Therefore,
 it is important that you mark your crossover cables or use a different color cable to
 designate a crossover cable. Many companies use yellow or black cables for regular
 cables and blue for crossover cables. You will not need many crossover cables, and
 you can make them yourself if you have the correct pinout.


Hardware Loopback
 A hardware loopback adapter is a way to test the ports on a system without having
 to connect to an external device. For example, you can use a serial loopback adapter
 to verify that a transmitted signal is leaving your serial port and returning through
 the loopback adapter, thereby ensuring that your serial port is working correctly.


tone generators
 A tone generator is used to perform tests on phone and network lines in what is
 referred to as a fox-and-hound process. The device clips to a wire, terminal panel, or
 standard modular jack and aids in the identification of wires during the wire-tracing
 process. You begin by attaching the “fox” to the cable, jack, or panel that you want
 to trace, and you continue with the “hound” on the other end of the cable to find
 the fox’s tone. When you find the tone, you know that you have correctly tracked
 the cable. This is very helpful for determining which cable in a group of many
 cables, such as a wiring closet, has gone bad and needs to be replaced.


time Domain reflectometers
 A time domain reflectometer (TDR) is used to troubleshoot problems with a cable
 by sending a signal down the cable, where it is reflected at some point. The TDR
 then calculates the distance down the cable that the signal traveled before being
 reflected by measuring the amount of time it took for the signal to be returned. If
 this distance is less than your overall cable length, a cable problem exists at that
 distance from your location. (Yes, this means that it is in the most inconvenient
 location possible. It is a law of networking that when something breaks, it will be in
 the worst possible place to fix it.)
 Optical time domain reflectometers are similar to TDRs but are used to test the
 performance of fiber optic cables. 728 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network




oscilloscopes
 Oscilloscopes and toner probes can determine when there are shorts, crimps, or
 attenuation in a cable. An oscilloscope formats its output in a graphical format.
 Oscilloscopes are commonly used to test cables that have been recently run through
 walls to ensure that there are no problems with the cables before you use them.




 There are other network&amp;Network Integrated Polling Software
 troubleshooting tools to know about for the (SNIPS) monitor network activity from a
 exam, such as multimeters or voltage event Unix system. And temperature monitors
 recorders to monitor voltage. A butt set are used to monitor the temperature of

 system or operator Problems
 q In some cases, it is very clear whether a system or operator error has occurred.


 Checking Physical and Logical indicators
 q When you begin troubleshooting a network-related problem, you have
 several indicators available that will help you determine the problem.
 q Link lights are invaluable in determining whether a network connection is
 present. 730 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



 q Collision lights can help determine whether a network element has failed
 and is causing chatter.
 q Even more rudimentary in the network troubleshooting area than the link
 light is the power light.
 q An error display is a means of alerting you to a malfunction or failure in a
 device.
 q Similar to the error display is the error log, which maintains a listing of errors
 encountered.
 q Network Monitor is an outstanding tool for monitoring the network
 performance of your system.
 q Performance Monitor tracks the use of resources by the system components
 and applications.

 network troubleshooting resources
 q There are some resources available to help in your search for the solution to
 your problems. For instance, TechNet is a searchable database of all Microsoft
 articles and documentation on nearly all its products.
 q The web provides up-to-the-minute information on both hardware and
 software issues.

 each is operating system–specific.
 q When you are bringing a new server online or configuring a server with a new
 service such as DNS or WINS, it is imperative that you begin by verifying
 that the configuration is correct.
 q Make sure that you know the definition of WINS, DNS, the hosts file,
 and the LMHOSTS file. You won’t be expected to know any in-depth
 information about each, just the purpose of each. For more information,
 review Chapter 4.
 q A server running a virus-scanning program can make all the difference in
 keeping viruses out of your network.

seLf test ansWers

Managing network Problems
1. þ B. It’s a routing issue. If you have a very good understanding of routers and routing, and
 one segment of your network cannot communicate with another segment, you will immediately
 know that there is a problem with routing—possibly a router is malfunctioning.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. Segments are usually created by routers or bridges, and one of
 these will be the issue when one segment has problems contacting another. Default gateways
 are used to connect to the gateway or router that is used to contact other segments. Since some
 segments in the question can be contacted, the default gateway is fine. Since some PCs can be
 contacted, the hub is not locked up.
2. þ C. The network is no longer terminated. One segment of the network is not able to
 communicate with another segment; therefore, you should quickly determine that you have
 a routing problem. Another symptom is that everyone on the coaxial-based bus network is
 not able to communicate. The cause of this problem most likely lies with the network bus
 backbone, which requires terminators on each end.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. The terminator is a problem with bus networks and should be
 checked whenever the whole network is the issue. If none of the PCs on the local segment can
 be contacted, the problem is not a router or gateway. Hubs do not simply lock up, so this is not
 the issue.
3. þ D. Ping the UNIX server by IP address. You can test the routing problem by trying to
 communicate with another computer on the corporate headquarters network. For example, you
 can ping another computer on this network or use a program that connects to a computer on
 this network. Name resolution is usually not an issue when using terminal-type programs. They
 usually use the IP address, not the name of the server, when contacting the server.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Ping allows you to determine whether the problem is the hub, a
 router, or another network device.
4. þ A, C, and D. The network drop was not activated, TCP/IP is not configured correctly,
 or the network adapter was damaged in the move. When new cable drops have been run,
 sometimes they are not correctly connected in the wiring closet to a hub and therefore will not
 allow connection to the network. If TCP/IP is statically configured, the configuration needs to
 be updated, especially if the PC is on a new segment. Sometimes cards or other PC hardware
 become damaged if proper care is not taken in handling the PC.
 ý B is incorrect because cables are not usually moved with a PC. 738 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



troubleshooting network Problems
 5. þ A. Divide the network in half, terminate it, and find which side is still not functioning.
 The best example of this is in thinnet coax. Determine the midpoint of the cable and place a
 terminator on each end. One-half of the cable should now be working, and it is obviously not
 the source of your problem. Repeat this step until you solve the problem.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because using a sniffer or fox-and-hound tool would require
 about as much work, but moving the terminator would allow you to find the source of the
 problem with no extra tool other than the terminator, which is readily available. These tools
 might not be available to all technicians. Network Monitor might not always determine which
 computer is causing the problem. If the problem is in a cable rather than a computer, Network
 Monitor will be of no help.

system or operator Problems
 6. þ A, B, and C. He forgot his password, his account has been disabled, or his password has
 expired. You need to intervene to correct the situation.
 ý D is incorrect because a coworker cannot change Steve’s password while he is on vacation.

Checking Physical and Logical indicators
 7. þ A. Check the error log. Error logs usually don’t contain enough information to solve a
 problem, and documentation must be consulted to diagnose and resolve it. However, checking
 the error logs is important because you can determine when the problem occurred, what might
 have caused the problem, and what other processes are affected by this problem.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. Pinging the server verifies that TCP/IP is running and functional
 on the server, and if there are no calls from users unable to contact the server, this is not an issue.
 Running diagnostics can help, but you are not sure what diagnostics to run. Diagnostics can be
 run on all the physical hardware, the database, or the network. Restarting the computer and
 troubleshooting the system still require you know where to start troubleshooting.
 8. þ C. Run Performance Monitor to perform an assessment of the current system activity and
 compare that with your previous baseline, taken before the configuration change took place.
 Performance Monitor can be used for a variety of purposes, including the following: identifying
 bottlenecks in CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network I/O; identifying trends over a period of time;
 monitoring real-time system performance; monitoring system performance history; determining
 the capacity the system can handle; and monitoring system configuration changes.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. Visual inspection of system performance is not a very good Self Test Answers 739


 measure. It is hard to visually determine CPU and hard disk performance as well as other system
 resources. Network Monitor does not show system degradation or problems. Event Viewer shows
 only system-generated errors, not performance issues from configuration changes.
 9. þ B. Performance Monitor shows network requests are backing up in the queue. Performance
 and network monitoring can determine whether the server is overloaded or broadcasting
 unnecessarily. An overloaded server can increase the length of time needed to fulfill network
 requests.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. A constant network light shows that the network or even the
 server network card is overburdened. Network Monitor is used to check for an overburdened
 network, not a server. When logging on, if you do not give the system enough time to start,
 services could still be in the process of being loaded, which can cause slow logon issues but does
 not mean that the server is overburdened.
10. þ B. Configure the snapshots to take place at midnight each night. Taking snapshots
 of activity from various periods of the day, week, and month gives you the most accurate
 assessment of your network. The longer you spend baselining your network, the more accurate
 the results. If you are taking network activity snapshots only at midnight, you are not getting an
 accurate assessment of the normal network activity that occurs throughout the day.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because they are all good recommendations.

network troubleshooting resources
11. þ C. If you are having a problem with a NIC not properly communicating on the network, a
 good place to start is the web site of the NIC’s manufacturer. Most sites provide troubleshooting
 information, suggested steps to resolve common problems, phone numbers with which to
 contact technical support, and the latest updated drivers.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. TechNet offers specific publications dealing with the Microsoft
 Windows and applications, not hardware drivers. Resource kits provide more information and
 tools for a software product. The documentation CD does not have the most up-to-date driver,
 if it contains drivers at all.
12. þ D. Resource kits contain additional operating system documentation that was too
 comprehensive to cover in the standard documentation. Whenever you are faced with a
 problem that you cannot solve, check the resource kit—your problem might already have been
 solved by someone else.
 ý A, B, and C are incorrect. Windows magazines have information on various topics, and it
 could require some searching to find an article on migration, if any exist in a specific magazine.
 Telephone tech support is for problematic issues, not migration strategies. Vendor CDs contain
 documentation and drivers for specific products. 740 Chapter 13: Troubleshooting the Network



13. þ B. You probably don’t need the number of users on the network. To improve the speed and
 accuracy of your technical support incident, make sure that you have the following ready to
 assist the support technician: hardware and software environment details, such as the operating
 system you are running; version numbers of affected hardware or software; serial numbers; a
 detailed account of the problem; and troubleshooting steps taken so far and their results.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because they are needed for your session with tech support.
14. þ B. The domain controller could be down. If no one else is receiving this error message, it is
 probably a local workstation issue, either with an incorrect TCP/IP configuration or a problem
 with the network adapter or cable. Make sure that the network card has a link light and the
 cable is firmly plugged in. You should also try replacing the cable to the workstation.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect because they are valid potential causes of the problem.
15. þ A. It takes a long time to print a large document that contains images. For example, it
 might take your network only three seconds to spool up a print document, but it could take
 another network one minute to spool up a document of the same size. This doesn’t mean the
 second network has a problem; it could be a normal physical condition for their network.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect. Authentication is a process that requires information sent to
 a server for verification, which could take awhile if the network is busy. This is a common
 problem in the morning, when many users are attempting to log on at the same time.
 Sometimes portions of a database can be locked out when one user is updating the information.
 Mainframes can cause issues; users being kicked off the mainframe can be a common occurrence
 at those times.
16. þ A. The DHCP addresses scope. You need to gather information prior to installing the
 service. This information includes your domain name, the IP address of each server for which
 you want to provide name resolution, and the hostname of each server. Otherwise, you will not
 know how to configure the service for proper use on your network.
 ý B, C, and D are incorrect because they are all needed to install a DNS service.
17. þ B and C. WINS does not require replication with all other WINS servers. You must
 manually enter the address mappings. A few of the WINS configuration settings are the
 duration of the client renewal and extinction of names and the replication partners with which
 this WINS server replicates. You can strategically replicate with other WINS servers based on
 frequency and location.
 ý A and D are incorrect. WINS does resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses. The WINS
 database is dynamically managed by WINS. Self Test Answers 741


other symptoms and Causes of network Problems
18. þ B. When you can communicate with systems on the local network, but not remote
 networks or the Internet, the problem is typically related to the router. As a result, you should
 ping the router to see if it is up and running.
 ý A, C, and D are incorrect. You may run ipconfig, but you don’t really need to because you
 are communicating with other systems on the local network. There is no need to ping a local
 server or workstation because you know that you can already communicate with systems on the
 local LAN.
19. þ C. A number of network issues arise because of faulty cables or cables being accidentally
 disconnected. Always check the simple stuff like connections first!
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect because they are not items that you would check first. You may
 verify the IP address, but you check that the network cable is plugged in first.

network tools
20. þ C. Eliminate complicated cable problems by examining cables with a TDR to find any
 problems.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. Visually inspecting a cable cannot determine whether the cable
 is faulty. You need more advanced tools to determine whether a cable is faulty. Using tools saves
 time and money if you catch a potentially faulty cable before it is put into production.
21. þ C. Use a TDR or an oscilloscope to find the exact spot where the cable is broken. If you
 don’t have access to such a tool, you might be able to replace the cable without determining the
 exact area of breakage.
 ý A, B, and D are incorrect. A tone generator is used to determine the two ends of a specific
 cable within a large bulk of cables. A spectrum division analyzer is used with fiber-optic cables
 to determine their quality. A fox and hound is the same as a tone generator. This page intentionally left blank A

 The entire contents of the Study Guide are provided in PDF files. Adobe’s Acrobat
 Reader has been included on the CD.


CertCam
 The CertCam clips are provided as .exe ﬁles and provide detailed examples of
 key certiﬁcation objectives. These clips walk you step-by-step through various
 networking tasks. You can access the CertCam video clips by clicking the
 CertCams link off the main splash page, which appears when you place the CD
 in the CD-ROM tray. Once you click the CertCams link, a folder will appear
 containing all of the CertCams—simply double-click a CertCam to play it.
 The CertCam clips are recorded and produced using TechSmith’s Camtasia
 Studio. We have compiled each .avi ﬁle into an .exe that contains TechSmith’s
 special AVI codec, custom player, and the AVI itself. When you double-click on the
 .exe ﬁle, the player is launched automatically and the video is played in the player.


Lab Files
 There are a number of lab ﬁles that are used throughout the exercises in the
 book. The lab ﬁles are included in the LabFiles folder in the root directory of the
 CD-ROM. The lab ﬁles contain items such as packet capture ﬁles used to view
 precaptured trafﬁc, a test web page, and a Security and Backup Plan checklist you
 can use as a base to build your own checklist.


Lab Book Exercises
 There are a number of step-by-step exercises included on the CD that do not
 appear in the book. This lab ﬁle, LabBook.pdf, is included in the root directory of
 the CD-ROM.
