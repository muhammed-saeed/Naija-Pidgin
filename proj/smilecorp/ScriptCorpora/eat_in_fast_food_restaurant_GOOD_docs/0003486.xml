The food is fabulous...  Kay C Marie  Kravchuck Located in the historic town of Charlestown, Maryland, The Wellwood has been owned and operated by the Metz family for over 50 years.   In the Late 1800&apos;s The Wellwood Club was originally a private Hunting and Fishing Club that was established as&quot;An organization of optimists and humanitarians in the broadest sense. Its purpose is to promote the &apos;happy&apos; habit; to reduce the friction of life to a minimum and increase the pleasure of existence to the maximum; to discourage strife and promote good fellowship.&quot;The second floor of The Wellwood holds rooms named for States that had sent letters to the Club, requesting that a room be named after their state so that their representative would have a place to call&quot;home&quot;. 

The Metz family acquired the Wellwood in 1958. We believe in using only choice meats, fresh seafood and fresh produce in preparing a quality meal for you&amp;your guests. We hope to always make your visit special
