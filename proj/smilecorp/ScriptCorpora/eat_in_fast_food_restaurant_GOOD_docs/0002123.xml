       The Worst Rob Liefeld Drawings . Well...that&apos;d be about all of them, wouldn&apos;t it? What makes this is the commentary:
&quot;here is a simple guide to creating your own Image Comics character
1 - take a pre-existing Marvel or DC Comics character that fat guys would like (The Punisher)
2 - change his name to couple a negatively connotative word (blood, die, death) with a second but completely unrelated negatively connotative word (shot, hard, blow)
3 - draw scribbles all over him
4 - do not make him engaging or interesting ever&quot;
      ...And, of course, do not give him feet.

      One thing I&apos;ve never been asked for in 10 years of the liquor business is &quot;Do you have Cake Wine?&quot;
      ME: &quot; Cake Wine?&quot;

      ME: &quot;I don&apos;t know what that is.&quot;
      HER: &quot;It&apos;s Wine. For Cake.&quot;
      &quot;Wine for Cake?&quot;
      &quot;You know, fruitcake.&quot;
      &quot;What--to make fruitcake with?&quot;
      &quot;No, to drink with fruitcake!&quot;
      And you know what? Just an hour before, I&apos;d picked up a bottle of sweet red wine and read the label on the back, and laughed when it said that it was &quot;Perfect for fruitcake!&quot;
      But this knowledge served me naught. They bought the 3-liter jug of Riunite Lambrusco. They must have a really, really big fruitcake.

      Recent movie recommendations: Once , which is not what you&apos;d think. It&apos;s a romance about 2 people on the rebound, but it&apos;s not. It&apos;s more about music, and about...well, just real life. Nothing happens in the movie that couldn&apos;t happen in reality. And the ending isn&apos;t what you&apos;d expect, but makes perfect sense. And leaves you wondering: about what, or who, are each of them thinking about in the last shots? A really enjoyable, quiet and subdued movie.
      On the other end of the spectrum, I saw Bender&apos;s Big Score , the Futurama &quot;movie.&quot; In quotes, as it&apos;s meant to be the new Comedy Central season of the show next year, with the &quot;movie&quot; cut down into 4 shows. And you can see the point where each show ends. It was funny, but not as hilarious as the show was. I think it was hurt by the inclusion of every little beloved bit from the show--Zap Brannigan, sure, but seriously, what was Robot Santa doing there? Twice? 
      If you&apos;re one of &quot;our many fans,&quot; by all means rent it. Bonus features include an episode of the 31st century&apos;s favorite show, &quot;Everybody Loves Hypnotoad.&quot; I loved it! In fact...MUST WATCH AGAIN

      COLOR COMMENTARY, A LITTLE TOO COLORFUL
I just came back from the Canucks dressing room, and Pavels groin has never felt better.
--hockey color commentator Tom Larscheid, during a Vancouver Canucks game
      Christmas isn&apos;t the most Wonderful TIme of the Year, it&apos;s the most expensive. And, lucky me, to have been gifted with so many unplanned expenses! And they&apos;re all necessities, and had to be replaced. Byron broke my glasses (can&apos;t drive a car without them); I took my car in for a $15.99 oil change, and ended up with over $1000 in repairs (can&apos;t drive a car without a car); and just as I figured out that maybe I wouldn&apos;t have to take too much out of my savings acount this month to cover it all, I get a $520 property tax bill (unless I want to live in my car). That&apos;s almost 2 grand in money I didn&apos;t intend to spend. I wondered today what the next bill from the blue would be; probably a traffic ticket or CRACK! No, not drugs, it was the sound of my desk chair as I sat in it. The back fell off.
      Not all the way, as one side&apos;s still attached. But I only have 3 other chairs. One is the armchair, and it&apos;s not fitting under the computer desk. The other 2 are from the early 60s and my sprathood. They have a wire back and a seat &quot;cushioned&quot; by a layer of thin vinyl and cardboard . We called them the &quot;torture chairs&quot; back then. I only have them as I use one as a stepstool, and the other as a sidetable.
      I tried adding a pillow and a blanket, but I found out that the real torture comes from the anti-ergonomic angle they force your back into. So I tried to fix the desk chair, somehow. I really don&apos;t keep a chair repair kit hanging around (do you?), so I did my usual extemporizing and have--for now--fixed it with a picture hanging kit. I loosened the screws from the metal plate that snapped through, wound braided picture wire around the back, and tightened the screws. It won&apos;t hold forever, but maybe it&apos;ll hold until I can afford a new chair, which is another necessity. At which point, my waterbed will burn down.
      It&apos;s that time of year again, for the best worst-of list around: the Beast&apos;s Most Loathsome People . My local free paper this year has its own version, The Clowns of 2007 .

      But tonight I had a hot curry salsa pepper turkey cheeseburger. I left the pan on the stove so that Byron wouldn&apos;t lick--Byron! what are you doing up there? no, you don&apos;t wanna--okay, go ahead if you think you wanna lick you some curry...

      WE&apos;RE PRETTY SURE OF THAT, TOO

      Yesterday, in 10 hours the forecast for tomorrow went from 4 inches of snow to 9, then 6, then 1 whole inch. Which of course means that when I got up today, it&apos;s now a foot.
      Of snow. Because as bad as that is, if it rained somebody&apos;s foot, that&apos;d be kinda gross.
      The plus side is that it&apos;s my day off, so I don&apos;t have to slog through a 20 mile commute, with only a baked potato for food and warmth. The downside is that it&apos;s my day off, so I had to go to the grocery store not only on a Sunday, but the day before a snowstorm. It was packed, with those crazy people buying bread, eggs and milk. As I&apos;ve said before, apparently the ultimate survival food is French toast. And we don&apos;t live in some remote Alpine village where we&apos;ll get snowed in for 2 weeks, we live in fucking Connecticut, where we&apos;ll be plowed out an hour after the snow stops. The worst that can happen is that the power goes out, and then what will you do with that fridge you filled with perishables?
      What I really don&apos;t understand is that this happens every storm. You&apos;d think that after the season&apos;s first storm, people would get that they don&apos;t need a shopping cart&apos;s worth of dairy products to survive. But I guess that they think that the dairy juju mojo is the reason they lived, because they&apos;re in the stores every time an inch is predicted.
      I also don&apos;t understand why nobody uses the self-serv robo-registers, no matter how long the lines are at the ones with actual cashiers. You&apos;re a rugged survivalist, ready to live on nothing but French toast for weeks, but you can&apos;t bag your own groceries? America: Land of the Panicked Lazy-Ass.
      If you&apos;re wondering what was on my emergency grocery list, it was yogurt for my work lunches, some chicken and turkey, and hair spritz. Because if I&apos;m snowed in until the fourth of July and go all Jeremiah Johnson, fighting the cats for the Friskies, I WILL NOT have crazy hair.
      Then I went to Taj Mahal and got me some chicken vindaloo. I&apos;m used to it being so spicy that I need to take a few minutes between bites, but it was so hot it made my ear canals hurt! I have no idea how THAT works, but the reason I buy Indian food is to freak my brain out, so job well done.
      Here&apos;s an odd little YouTube video I came across last night looking at something else: Stop That Tank! It&apos;s Disney animation from World War II I&apos;ve never seen (or heard of) before. It&apos;s about a British antitank rifle. Yes, not an an antitank cannon , an antitank rifle. You might wonder &quot;Wasn&apos;t the reason they invented tanks was because they needed something bulletproof ?&quot; and you&apos;d be right. This was a weapon that would&apos;ve been quite effective if WWII had started in 1929. Every army had these when the war started in 1939, and they all were obsolete. Except against armies using really shitty tanks , and those armies usually still had cavalry, and charging heavy machine guns while on horsies generally worked out poorly.
      Even the cartoon shows this, as the rifles don&apos;t destroy the tanks, just set them running as if they were stung by bees. Is it significant that the poor slobs using these are shown leaping from ambush from inside a horse&apos;s ass? This does defeat the tank commander, apparently Charlie Chaplin off his meds, but this is followed by actual instructions in the rifle&apos;s use, which boil down to &quot;If this your job, you are SO FUCKED.&quot; There are 4 parts to the video, but you don&apos;t need to see the rest. Except for the very end, when the soldier so loves his gun, and is so far from his last touch of a woman that he&apos;s in bed with the rifle and passionately kissing it, apparently about to have rifle-butt secks with it. There&apos;s a bit in part 2 that instructs you to use this piece of shit to destroy tanks by shooting at the seams of the turret. Shooting at that tiny bit of real estate while a FUCKING TANK is bearing down on you requires a skill that I&apos;ll bet very few people lived to perfect.; it&apos;d be like grabbing a fly with chopsticks, and that only happens in Hong Kong movies.
      Side note: After the war, you could buy Finnish antitank guns, with full magazines, by mail order in America. While they were useless against tanks, they sure could do some damage to a police car. As to what they could do to a human being...this is the type of gun that could shoot you in the hand and you&apos;d die. You wouldn&apos;t just no longer have a hand, it&apos;d take most of your arm and you&apos;d die screaming from shock trauma and blood loss. I suppose hunters might&apos;ve bought them. If they were hunting dinosaurs.

&quot;What is called &apos;Science&apos; today and &apos;scientists&apos; consist of the same old gang of witch doctors, sorcerers, tellers of tales, the &apos;Priest-Entertainers&apos; for the common people. &apos;Science&apos; consists of a weird, way-out occult concoction of jibberish theory-theology... nothing good has ever come from &apos;science&apos; --- In fact, technology is not in any way related to the web of idiotic scientific theory. ALL inventors have been anti-science. The Wright brothers said: &quot;Science theory held us up for years. When we threw out all science, started from experiment and experience, then we invented the airplane.&quot; By the way, airplanes all fly level on this Plane earth!
The Fact the Earth is Flat is not my opinion, it is a Proved Fact! While all we need to know is that the Bible says the Earth is flat (Is.40:22, Ez.7:2, Dn.2:35; 4:10-11,20, Mt.4:8)... but for a second can you imagine what these so-called &apos;scientists would have us believe --- If the earth really was round, that would mean there arre people who are HANGING DOWN, HEAD DOWNWARDS while we are standing head up?&quot;
&quot;Apes are just creatures twisted by Satan to mock Jesus by giving EVILolition credibility. Further more they are naturally lust crazed for human women. Since they are not natural creatures they should be exterminated forthwith as the tools of evil they are.&quot;
&quot;What the heathen Statue of Liberty really means...
Freedom to worship satan (Note: we do not capitalize the word satan even when it begins a sentence).
Freedom to practice obstetrics and gynecology as a male physician ...&quot;
&quot;No one knows what&apos;s happening until the flood comes (according to Matthew). And the flood is here - it refers to the apocalypse. There is a huge amount of supporting evidence on the site.

      PATIENTS, CRITICALLY FORGETFUL
Patient has left his white blood cells at another hospital.
--actual comment written by a doctor on a patient&apos;s chart
      I was working 2 or 3 extra hours a week at my job. I was getting paid for them, so that was nice. But it&apos;s the slow season, and until it picks up again, the extra time has been cut out of the budget.
      This week&apos;s schedule had me down for coming in an hour late for 3 days. Late is lame. I come in at 1PM every Wednesday, and after an hour, it&apos;s not noticeable. Especially since I usually either sleep an hour longer (or just lie awake in bed longer, like I did today--Killsy and Byron were both in bed with me, and that makes it hard to get up), or I get up and surf the web for a while. Which just cuts down on the time I&apos;d normally spend doing it at night. So I brokered a deal that lets me leave 2 hours early tomorrow instead. That should be noticeable.
      A downside to my schedule is that I work late. I&apos;ve always been a night person, so that&apos;s not a problem. But it is somewhat annoying to see even the briefest of sunshine after work for only 6 weeks a year. And now I work until 9PM 3 days a week, which lowers it to only a few days a year. Leaving at 6? That ups it a lot.
      I was wondering if there was a way that I could find out when I&apos;d see my first sunshine after work, if this does become my new schedule. And lo and behold, what should coincidentally appear in my inbox today but the Farmer&apos;s Almanac sunset calculator . I should start seeing at least a bit of light on Thursdays starting the third week of February, and full sun once Daylight Savings kicks in on March ninth.
      This may not be of any utility to you people with normal schedules, although it also lists the time of dawn for you poor souls who actually have to greet that rosy-fingered motherfucker.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, GREAT PREDICTIONS PRINTED IN
In the year 2000, we will live in pre-fabricated houses light enough for two men to assemble, . . . cook in our television sets, and relax in chairs that emit a private sound-light-color-spectacular.
--from a New York Times story, January 7, 1968
      Old joke: Guy takes a pee in a public restroom, then accidentally drops a quarter into the urinal. He stares at it for a few seconds, then takes a hundred dollar bill out of his wallet and throws it in. The guy next to him says, &quot;What did you do that for?!&quot; The first guy says &quot;I&apos;m not going in there for a quarter!&quot;
      While I&apos;m an avid recycler, it does kinda suck to be part of the recycling chain. Connecticut has a &quot;Bottle Bill,&quot; whereby people get a nickel back on their deposit cans. What does that make me? Bottle Bill, the man who has to handle their wet, scummy recyclables.
      What would you do for a goddamn nickel? I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard that poor people will dumpster dive for them. But if you owned a car, and it was January with subfreezing temperatures, and you were transporting your empties inside your enclosed car--would you do what a guy did a few years ago? Bring back a Molson Ice bottle full of stinking vomit? In the store, I could smell it from 6 feet away. If that same nickel was lying in a pool of rancid vomit, would you stick your hand in and grab it?
      I assumed that he was the absolute nadir of &quot;I&apos;m not going in there for just a nickel!&quot; Until today. Somebody returned a Seagram&apos;s wine cooler with a dead mouse inside it. Actually, a rottting mouse.

WOULD-BE PRESIDENTS, NOT SO STIRRING MOMENTS WITH
Reporter: What did you major in in college?
Sen. Carol Moseley Brown (D-Illinois), who had just announced she was going to run for president: I&apos;m going to guess it was political science, but I&apos;m not sure. It might have been history. I&apos;ll check. I hadn&apos;t thought of that one.

CONFIDENCE-BUILDING COMMENTS BY BANK DIRECTORS
I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve stolen any money recently.

      I don&apos;t follow sports at all. I do smile when the Red Sox win, but that&apos;s a) because they&apos;ve been underdogs for so long, and b), as a customer once so succinctly put it, &quot;It&apos;s not so much that I like them, as much as there are so many Yankees fans who are assholes.&quot;
      I don&apos;t suppose anybody remembers Mr Poopy Pants, the bane of everyone&apos;s existence at my last job, but that&apos;s the guy I always think of when of when the Yankees lose. He used to get so mad at that karmic hammer blow.
      The only sports I sorta follow is the question of who&apos;ll be in the Stupid Bowl. But that&apos;s purely work-related. Newbies in the biz always think that we&apos;ll have some hugely busy Saturday before it, but we almost always don&apos;t. Maybe long ago, when the game was played during the afternoon it was, but now it&apos;s at night, and everybody has to go to work the next day. It&apos;s only a busy day if the teams are local ones, like the Giants or the Patriots. THEN it&apos;s a big deal! Any other teams and it&apos;s no big--WHAT?!?!
      It&apos;s the Giants VERSUS the Pats?!
      (rubs temples) That&apos;s going to be one looong Saturday...
      Izzard on Genesis: &quot;No, I want an Ark! With a big room for poo!&quot; 
      In the most &quot;Well--DUH!&quot; scientific research study ever done, it was discovered that children hate and fear clowns . Even when they&apos;re 16! &quot;Can&apos;t sleep, clown will eat me!&quot;

HEIL, NO!
Game show host: What is Hitler&apos;s first name?
Contestant: Heil.
--on the game show Family Fortunes, ITV (UK)
      Via Pharyngula , the only blog I always read that has a name I no idea of how to pronounce, the exciting super-duper video game Noah&apos;s Adventures . Check out that teaser--boy, that, umm, sure makes one want to, umm, buy this steamer. The constant action! (People wiggle in place) The stunning voice talent! (It would make Forrest Gump say &quot;What are these people, fucking retarded?&quot;) The realistic effects! (Skip to the 5:30 mark when you start to get bored--which will around 2:15 mark--and see the meowing sheep, and the 80MPH elephants that smash down the only tree in the world, rather than walk around it) The exciting gameplay! Which is what, sexing badgers and building that big room for poo?
      No, check out the second gameplay video . Noah must get cowboy hats for elk, and &quot;soccer footballs&quot; for pandas. It&apos;s in the FUCKING BIBLE, LOOK IT UP!!!
      I assume that, since Biblical literalism is the theme, that there&apos;s a post-Flood scene where you repopulate the world by getting Noah so drunk, he impregnates his daughters. That is in the Bible, BTW.
      (Even if the entire world&apos;s humans were so evil that only Noah&apos;s incestuous family of alcoholics could be saved, why were only 2 each of the animals spared? Were there really that many sinful gophers? Couldn&apos;t have God just given all the animals waterwings for 40 days? He IS God, after all; you&apos;d think that he could swing that)
      Along with Funny Times and Seed magazines today, I got a hand-addressed envelope. I was from the Hobotopia guy! I got a PayPal giftcard for Xmas, and I had no idea what to do with it (and if you get one, you&apos;re better off not knowing. The instructions claim that registering it will &quot;link it to your PayPal account,&quot; and if you think that means &quot;just like how an Amazon giftcard works, using up every penny before it charges you differently&quot; you will find yourself wrong. You have to enter the code on it every time you want to use it, waaay at the bottom of the page, because otherwise, it won&apos;t take). He offered, for only a few hours, original LOLCat art with a free &quot;Pip Fan Club&quot; membership. Since I would get it all for FREE on the giftcard (or not free at all; see above), I clicked through.
       
      The ID card is sitting on a can opener, but that didn&apos;t come out. Because hoboes eat things from cans! Like stew!
      You could get 2 extra ID cards, but why would I need those? Then I went &quot;O YAH!&quot;
       
       
      I also has TEH SEKRIT that all Pip Fan Club members get. You will not get it here! FAIL!
      kthxbye!

SOME PEOPLE ARE EASILY IMPRESSED
I took a poo in the woods hunched over like an animal. It was awesome.

      TOILETS, REAL BIG
Newsweek screwed up. Nearly everyone admits that, including the magazine&apos;s editors, who retracted an inadequately sourced report that U.S. interrogators had flushed a Korean down the toilet at Guantanamo Bay.
--Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun
      When I get home from work, Byron is always at the door. He has a very narrow range of sounds that he can hear, and apparently, the garage door opening and closing is one. It took him 4 years to connect that sound with &quot;human comes home.&quot;
      Or did he somehow learn it from Killsy? She&apos;s been at the door since kittenhood. These days, she hangs just behind the bigfooted one. Then they both race ahead of me to the kitchen, where they get pets.
      She does, but he doesn&apos;t, understand &quot;day off.&quot; She sees that I wear different clothing on a day off. The first thing she grasped is that on a day off, I turn on the computer. On a work day, the first thing I do is brush my teeth. Byron has never picked up any of this, and makes a certain sound (&quot;brrHH?&quot;) when I get home when it&apos;s still light out. But they both understand that on workdays, &quot;The mommy comes home after dark.&quot;
      This is the second Thursday I&apos;ve come home 2 hours earlier. Only Kill Kill was at the door both days. Instead of running ahead of me, both times she just stood there, perplexed. Byron was asleep on my chair, and brrHH?ed awake both times. And then he&apos;s perplexed. It&apos;s like they don&apos;t expect me home that early.
      How the hell do they know? It&apos;s still dark out! The only explanation I&apos;ve come up with is that I always leave the radio on when I leave. Before she came here, I heard that that was a way to keep kittens from feeling lonely when you&apos;re gone. I leave when classical music is playing, and get home when jazz is playing. But on Thursdays, it&apos;s talk and news. Does Kill Kill know the difference? While that makes sense--how does Byron know? Is that in his narrow band, too? And does that mean he knows when I talk to him?
      Animals: Always smarter than you think.
      I received a FREE! offer for an ass-trology reading, so I took it up my astrology. The link only works from my IP, although, as you may guess from this part of its url, &quot;happinessishealthandwealth.com/forecast/ orders &quot;, and the page is titled Ordering Processing Gateway , it&apos;s received by every idiot who believes hunks of rocks orbiting a billion miles away controls their fate. Excerpts:
 Bill, were in for a financially dangerous Leap Year in 2008. I urge you to protect yourself before February 29th! 
      THANK JUPITER it&apos;s not a normal year! Then I&apos;d only have until the 28th! THEN I&apos;D BE DEAD.

 
      That would be the image below that terrfying warning. Kinda...makes you think they&apos;re selling something. Looking at Adam, I think it&apos;s penis enlarging pills.
       The next Leap Year will be upon you on February 29th... 

      Actually, it began 25 days ago, but do go on.
       ...and as your newfound friend and advisor, I want to make sure you are protected during what is predicted to be quite a financially dangerous leap year.
      What can you do about falling stock prices, the collapse of the housing market, or the fact that the dreaded word recession is on everyones lips? 
      Hmm...live within my means, cut expenses, pay down any bills, and spend only on what I truly need?
       The answer is protect yourself with a 24K Gold vermeil Amulet of Ultimate Protection. 
      GOD I AM SO DUMB!! What I need is to SPEND money on a MAGIC MEDALLION! Made of 24K VERMEIL! Because vermeil is so important! It&apos;s so valuable! It&apos;s so ULTIMATE! It&apos;s...umm, no, I have no idea either.
      Wikipedia says that it is &quot;sometimes called silver gilt, is a combination of sterling silver, gold, and other precious metals.&quot; Oh, that&apos;s great! It&apos;s actually silver , not gold, but there are precious metals in it. It&apos;s not gold, in other words. But at least better than the Glassman family&apos;s kids next door, who got those gold-foil chocolate coins every Hanukkah. (Wait--no it&apos;s not! Chocolate you can EAT!)
