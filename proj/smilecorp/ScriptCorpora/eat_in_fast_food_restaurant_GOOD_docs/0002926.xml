 Beer Quality Beer Selection Food Service Overall Awesome! Great Awesome! Awesome! Great As a maker, avid craft drinker, and travler of beer I made my way from Austin, Texas to Brixie&apos;s tonight while in the area at a seminar. The outside of the place makes it look small but is has plenty of open space inside with dining/drinking tables, pool tables and a walk-up/sit-down bar. The draught beer selection was nice at around 48 beers and I only count the draught because that&apos;s usually all I drink. They had nice local/regional and a rounded set of micros from East to West coast. Most impressive was the pour from Kate! She spent some time making sure my first pint was poured correctly and then asked if the pour was ok and the same for the second...quite impressive! I would pay an extra dollar if every bartender was so attentive to the pour. The bar folks were loud types but it is a bar after all. I got the plain jane burger with cheese medium rare. It was a nice 10 oz hunk, char grilled and cooked as I ordered. The fries were as good as they get. It was only my first trip here but it is obvious Brixie&apos;s is making a great effort to be a top notch beer place.
