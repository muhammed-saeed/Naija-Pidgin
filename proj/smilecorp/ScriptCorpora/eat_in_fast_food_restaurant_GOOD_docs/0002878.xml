 A $110 loan, then 20 years of debt bondage 
 
By Siddharth Kara , Special to CNN

 Editor’s Note: Trafficking expert Siddharth Kara is a Harvard fellow and author of the award-winning book,&quot; Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery .&quot;For more than 15 years, he has traveled around the world to research modern-day slavery, interviewing thousands of former and current slaves. Kara also advises the United Nations and governments on anti-slavery research and policy. 

A bonded laborer named Haresh in West Bengal, India, once described to me how he took a loan of approximately $110 from the local landowner to get married to his beloved wife, Sarika.

Two decades later, Haresh told me, “My entire family is still in debt to the landowner.  Sarika and I work in the fields, my sons and their wives work at the brick kilns.  One day my grandchildren will work for the landowner.  There is no way to repay these debts.  We will only be free when we die.” 

Haresh had no real sense of what his outstanding debts were.  Since his initial loan, he had taken numerous loans from the same landowner for basic subsistence, medicines, repairs to his hut and other reasons.  He was also charged interest that often exceeded 100% per year.  Destitute and isolated, Haresh could not access any other source of credit.  He and his family were forced to work 14 or more hours a day by the landowner, almost every day of the year, with barely enough food and water to survive.

Haresh’s story is an example of the millions of bonded laborers across South Asia.  Like Haresh, many bonded laborers have been in bondage for much of their lives.  Others enter in and out of bondage several times; and still others enter in and out of bondage every year for seasonal industries, such as agriculture and brick-making.  These individuals take loans and try to work them off, but due to deeply exploitive manipulations by their exploiters, they end up toiling against these small debts for years.

It is important to understand: bonded labor is a form of slavery prohibited by international and South Asian law.  However, bonded labor remains an ever-evolving, highly complicated mode of labor exploitation that persists in broad daylight.

At its essence, bonded labor involves the exploitive interlinking of credit and labor agreements that devolve into slave-like exploitation due to severe power imbalances between the lender and the borrower.  The system persists due to poverty, absence of alternative credit sources, a lack of justice and rule of law, and social acceptance of the exploitation of minority castes and ethnicities that has been prevalent in South Asia since Vedic times.

Debt bondage is not historically unique to South Asia.  It was a common mode of feudal labor exploitation across much of the world centuries ago.  However, a mix of social revolution and transition to industrialized market economies largely extinguished bonded labor throughout Europe, North America and East Asia.  No such revolution ever took place in South Asia.

As a result, I estimate there are approximately 18.5 to 22.5 million debt bondage slaves in the world today, almost 90% of whom are in South Asia.  This makes bonded labor the most expansive form of slavery in the world, with approximately six out of 10 slaves being bonded laborers.  (Related: The challenges of counting a ‘hidden’ population )

Bonded labor is also an active contributor to the global economy.  I have documented hundreds of bonded laborers in more than 20 industries, such as rice, tea, frozen fish and shrimp, carpets, cigarettes, fireworks, minerals and stones, gems and apparel.  I have also traced the supply chains of these products from the point of exploitation in South Asia to retailers in the European Union and the United States.

Beyond the global economy, bonded labor may also present risks to global security.  My most current research indicates there are increasing security risks associated with the suffering, poverty, and exploitation that feeds into debt bondage.  Extremists in Pakistan and India have begun to recruit amongst current, former, and potential bonded laborers with promises of income, stability, and a way of fighting back against the governments that have consigned them to abuse and exploitation.

Bonded labor is a relic of history that should have long ago been eliminated from South Asia, but greed, corruption, and government ineffectiveness allow this caustic mode of exploitation to persist well into modern tines.  In order to ensure basic human rights, guarantee untainted global supply chains, and protect international security, the forces that promote bonded labor must be tackled immediately.

Replace&quot;small loan&quot;with&quot;student loan/mortgage&quot;and replace&quot;landowner&quot;with&quot;bank&quot;, and then explain to me how this is different than the US?

Then you can&apos;t see the forest for the trees. The only difference between the poor guy in the story and the weetren world is that we enter into that bondage to credit card companies and student loans willingly without regards to the consequences but once entrapped we then become slaves to our own greed. 25% interest on a loan that gets jacked up for the slightest reason when the mob made loans of that nature it was against the law but when so say legal lenders do nobaody bats an eye.
 June 3, 2011 at 1:15 pm | Ruth 

What 25%? My student loans are 3.75% Anyone who agrees to a 25% loan is a moron.
 June 3, 2011 at 3:09 pm | Rigel54 

What&quot;Common Sense&quot;says is ridiculous. The first fundamental difference is that credit terms in the US are generally reasonable. It is relatively easy to get credit cards with ~7% interest. Even at 15% one has to be pretty stupid to bury oneself. Even if one does manage to get in so deep that one can&apos;t get out, bankruptcy offers a resolution far short of a lifetime of slavery. The comparison is absurd.
 June 3, 2011 at 3:13 pm | john 

common sense is right. 25 percent is called&apos;usery&apos;and it is a federal crime for any private loan. the only corporation that is exempt is the banking idustry. if your credit is bad they can charge up to 45 percent APR.

If he and his family are forced to work 14 or more hours a day by the uhm bank that gave him the college loan, almost every day of the year, with barely enough food and water to survive–then he is indeed in the situation here in America.

And it would indeed by slavery–but in reality there isn&apos;t the same power balance or&apos;bonded labor&apos;link.
In the U.S. if you have no income–you are judgement free. It&apos;s only if you have an income that it can be garnished–it can be garnished up to a certain percentage–according to your states laws–but its not 100%–it doesn&apos;t transfer to your family at all. And in reality, the bank can&apos;t make you work to pay off the debt. What they can do, is make a note of your non-payment or turn it over to a collections company–but even there you have rights, you can tell the collection company they cannot contact you and make it entirely a matter for the courts.

The courts will not make you a slave–period. Garnishment of 25% of our income–is something that might happen.

It might be different in the ultimate level of misery experienced in life but maybe you can explain to all of us dumbies how there is no comparison to the United States wherein you are kept in debt if you want to get an education or healthcare. I suppose you can skip all that and just live on the Burger King salary which is all that is going to be left when all of the manufacturing has been shipped to China and much of the service has been shipped to India but it is a good thing for the Wal-Mart families of the world. I am sure this is all just because the rest of us aren&apos;t as clever as you though.

To all those that think it&apos;s different here and the comparison is ludicrous....

Have you ever been debt free since you left high school? Do you not work everyday in order to re-pay that debt?

Are any of you able to just quit work? why not? Because you must pay your mortgage, fix your house, keep the utilities on, pay the taxes and put food on the table.

How different would your life be if you had no debt. Would you still go to work?

this analogy is the most ridiculous arrogant ignorant thing I have read in a long time.&quot;Man, I&apos;m stuck with this credit card debt that I acquired buying things I couldn&apos;t afford and didn&apos;t really need. It&apos;s like I&apos;m a slave in India or something. Oh well, I guess I&apos;ll just look at Facebook for a minute then play some Playstation 3 for a while, then go to bed after I eat a nice steak dinner at a fancy restaurant, all of which I paid for on my credit card. It&apos;s like I&apos;m a slave in India for real&quot;
 June 4, 2011 at 8:13 pm | @JoshH 

Exactly, Josh. How about some context? Do you whiners REALLY thing your children and their wives will be paying for your student loans? When was the last time you didn&apos;t have enough food or water? Are you really so self-absorbed and vain to think you suffer? We can all claim bankruptcy, at least. We all signed up for the loans and got profits from them- whether we bought stuff, an education, or healthcare. Our system isn&apos;t perfect, but please, don&apos;t be so self-righteous as to lose compassion for others in the world who really do suffer. We don&apos;t know suffering. (&quot;I work every day to pay off my debt!! I suffer!&quot;Did you drive to work? Is your work place heated/air conditioned? Did you get your state-mandated breaks? Did you leave a house that was safe and comfortable? Are you well-fed? Yeah? THEN SHUT UP.)
 June 4, 2011 at 9:13 pm | Not always 

I had to open a credit card account to get $400 in repairs on my car, so I could get to work, so I could pay off the credit card... at 24.99%APR. Didn&apos;t have a choice in the matter. It&apos;s not always frivolous. My credit went sour when I was in school and had to work full time, fell behind on utility bills, medical bills (to the tune of $6k that is still owed), and ended up with items that I am just waiting to have fall off my credit now that they&apos;re paid off. The assumption that people with bad credit are people who have&quot;unnecessary extras&quot;is just untrue. There are many of us scraping by for essentials.

eddie&apos;s post is really obvious Chinese propaganda. They can&apos;t fix their society, so their only option is to try to project their failures onto us.

Rigel54 says&quot;95% of Americans don&apos;t make less than $50,000 per year. Most Americans don&apos;t die penniless. Why do you just make these things up? People check, you know, even if they don&apos;t know.&quot;

To bad YOU just make these things up. People DO check, and the average US Per Capita Income in 2009 was $39,138, courtesy of the US Census Bureau. Don&apos;t be a moron and spew incorrect info. People in this country need help, and absent the slavery part, Corporate America is doing a VARIATION on what has been reported in China. Bilking people out of their earnings is just plain wrong, and just because it&apos;s&quot;LEGAL&quot;doesn&apos;t make it&quot;JUST&quot;or&quot;MORALLY RIGHT&quot;.
 June 6, 2011 at 9:42 am | DJ 

@Rigel54,

Your facts are totally wrong. Student loans CAN NOT be discharged in bankruptcy. There is no statute of limitations on student loans. People are losing their social security checks to student loans - that&apos;s correct, not even your retirement income is immune. All garnishments relating to student loans (wages, tax refunds, and social security) can be done by the lender WITHOUT a court order.

Collection fees on student loans absolutely do reach 25% and even higher: http://collectionagencydebt.blogspot.com/2011/04/defaulted-federal-student-loan.html Imagine waking up one morning and your balance increases overnight from $400000 to $500000. This absolutely does happen to many people.

You cannot blame these people for failing to read the fine print. The 2005 law eliminating the statute of limitations for student loans was RETROACTIVE. That means people who went to school in the 1970s and 1980s, who thought that the statute of limitations had expired on their loans, were suddenly retroactively subjected to collections. There was certainly no clause in their contract stating that they would be subject to retroactive changes in future law.

 Mrs. M 

Gee ... for one thing, you HAD A CHOICE!!! Nobody held a gun to your head to make you apply for or accept any student loan. If you made stupid choices, you were free to make that stupid choice and with freedom of choice comes consequences of the choices you make. Don&apos;t whine about your stupid choice, like it&apos;s somebody else&apos;s fault. Because, it&apos;s not. You could have worked to earn and save money to go to college (like a lot of us did.) You could have made a more intelligent choice regarding your choice of study, with realistic expectations regarding potential income derived from that choice of study. The American Dream has been bastardized far too long. You have a right to PURSUE happiness–NOT to have it given to you on a silver platter. You have a right to a basic (high school) education–NOT college. You have a right to free speech (except in cases of threatening a highly placed elected official, or discussing a potential exchange of money for sex) and that gives you the right to complain about things you&apos;d never dream of complaining about IF THAT COLLEGE EDUCATION YOU STUPIDLY BORROWED MONEY TO GET WAS WORTH THE PRICE, SINCE IT NEVER TAUGHT YOU TO WISE-UP!

 June 3, 2011 at 12:59 pm | Common Sense 

I don&apos;t know when or where you went to college but maybe you need to wake up to the real world. Work and save to go to college, get real. Today even if you wanted to work and save to go to a technical college, let alone a four year institution, you&apos;ll be working for a loooong time. And as you work to save up one year&apos;s tuition, time is passing the job market is shrinking as is the possibility of making that investment feasible. And don&apos;t even talk about pay as you go because any money you make will go for those little things like food, shelter, you know the things you have to pay for unless you&apos;re living woth Mom&amp;Dad and going to a school where you can just take a bus, subway, ride a bike or even walk to. We tell our kids to get a good education to get a good job but what good is that advice if when they take a course of study that will get them a good job only to be saddled with debt out their butts that have to be paid off with the money made on new job they have as well as having to pay for necessities?

Wow Tripp obviously cant read. 95% huh. head over to the IRS stats page and see what people make and pay taxes on. I think your in for quite a shock. 30 million people fall in the 50k-100k tax bracket. That&apos;s quite a bit more then 5%. Add to that the 20 million more who make between 100k and a million and you can see how badly your estimates are off.
 June 3, 2011 at 9:41 pm | Flick 

Geez Mrs. M, do you have a clue how things work anymore? You may have been able to work full time and go to school back when you did it in the mid 20th century, but times have changed. College education is getting ludicrously expensive to the point where people don&apos;t make enough to live and go to school. They have to get loans. Plus good paying jobs are getting harder and harder to find so people are paying a higher percentage of their earnings paying off a degree that may have been useful 4 years ago, but isn&apos;t really anymore. Even people with nursing degrees and engineering degrees are struggling to find jobs these days. This was not the case before the economic collapse.

I was fortunate enough that I did not need student loans, but I understand that they are the worst form of loans to be caught under. We need student loan reform NOW... and make it retroactive. If the banks suffer... oh well.

I am not sure if Mrs. M is completely right, but a buddy of mine is graduating with his Masters degree without paying a dime out of his own pocket (Navy GI Bill), my wife is going through nursing school for $40 a semester. So Maybe you guys that whine allot are just plain lazy? Dunno just a hunch.
 June 4, 2011 at 10:54 am | johnny 

That laborer had a choice too. Nobody made him accept the deal. Interestingly, children at 17 and 18 years old are told to just sign the loan papers for student loans because these loans will be&quot;nothing&quot;compared to the huge salaries they will have access to after college. Well, that wasn&apos;t true and the children were fooled into slavery right here in our own country. No different than the laborer in the story.
 June 4, 2011 at 10:56 am | Danielle 

I work 3 jobs over the summer to save for college and still did not have enough to pay. My parents helped as much as they could but alas we have other expenses too. It doesn&apos;t make you&quot;lazy&quot;as you suggest. I did as much as I could and graduated with honors and was involved in a prestigious internship while being involved in other college activities. I was also a note taker at college. Explain to me what I did wrong here?
 June 4, 2011 at 11:44 am | Cracko 

Yeah, Ms M, really, really stupid comment. Yeah, people have a&quot;choice&quot;to not go to college: they can go to work at Walmart for the rest of their lives instead. Nice choice, you imbecile. Also, they can go&quot;work hard&quot;and save the money for college. Good one again, you idiot...this isn&apos;t 1955 or even 1985. Apparently you havnt noticed but things have changed in this country, those good paying entry level jobs are hard to find, and college tuition is more expensive than ever, making loans the only real option for all but the most fortunate kids. Wake up you jerk...

 June 4, 2011 at 1:46 pm | MeleLoke 

Well spoken, Mrs. M! My three children each worked several jobs to get thru college, and did take out small loans to supplement their jobs, but that helped them learn the value of managing their money. These ARE choices we make. PanKot and others, you are creating your own&quot;victim mentality&quot;when you see yourself a slave to an employeer. I don&apos;t have a college degree, but I have worked as an employee and as an employer. An employee trades his time and effort in exchange for wages. Better yourself and prove your worth and you WILL move up in the world. He who sees himself as a&quot;victim&quot;of circumstances will always be a slave to someone, namely himself, if no one else! I realize that there are injustices in the world, but the notion (expressed in some of these comments) that employees are&quot;slaves&quot;because they are required to comply with the employer&apos;s guidelines, is what KEEPS them in their so-called&quot;slavery.&quot;
 June 4, 2011 at 5:52 pm | Harry 

Mrs. M, Very well said... If you were born in US, You should run for the President. We need more people like you to shake up people to get up their asses&amp;achieve... Until that happens no one can save this country. Not Mr.B&apos;s QE1, QE2, QE3...

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

They truly have no idea what privation is or what it feels like; but if they buy the GOP/TP line in 2012 they will definitely get a clue. You are NOT a slave, any of you.&quot;I borrowed money for college and now have to work hard to pay it back&quot;is not slavery, it&apos;s indebtedness. Welcome to adulthood.

 June 6, 2011 at 12:10 pm | AC 

To all of you saying that the Bengali laborer didn&apos;t&quot;have&quot;to get married: It&apos;s entirely possible that he actually did have to. Arranged marriages are still the norm in India. I personally know several who have had no choice, because once the dowry was accepted by the groom&apos;s family, it was a done deal.
 June 6, 2011 at 12:55 pm | sumday 

You talk about choice like it is a luxury afforded to all. Sure this man had a choice to get married and have kids or die single with no kids (that may be acceptable in our culture but taboo in theirs), Also he could choose not to eat and die, or live outside like the cavemen did instead of in a hut- I guess those are all reasonable choice in your mind huh? As for the USA- lets see sure you could not go to college I know of at least 1 person who didn’t and makes more than 35K, but everyone else that I know who didn’t go makes far less than that- but your right you can choice to basically stay poor with almost no ability to advance in the work force or take a loan to hopefully earn more money. Transportation yeah guess that is an option too you could always walk the 10-20 miles (both ways) to work (they do in other countries). House well you could buy a tent. Healthcare- you could just choose to die. Yes I guess you think those are all reasonable choices that person can make. I mean if you have no money and no job homeless&amp;starving is a perfectly acceptable alternative to buying the food and housing on credit right. Everyone has a choose I guess it’s just that human nature and survival really don’t leave open the door for those “alternative” choice that you seem to think everyone has. As for the mention of the GI bill (which is how I did it) it requires a few yr of bondage! I spent 3 yrs serving as a slave to the USA- I had no choice after I signed, I worked most days 12 hr or more (6am-6pm or later), was told what and how to do things and almost got an article 15 for a 2nd degree sunburn- I was told that qualified for destruction/damage of government property! So the GI bill is the exact same thing as selling yourself as a slave!

 danny 

eddie, i agree with you on this point to a certain extent. Many people have loans so high they will keep paying them for their lifetime - while the rich have it easy (daddy pay&apos;s for all tuition/boarding). It seems higher education (especially at the more prestegious schools) is something reserved for the rich (the rich get richer and the poor keep getting poorer).
However, we do have opportunities to work hard and get scholarships. Also, people need to be responsible with how much they borrow. I have seen people waste their loans on non-essential things (like flat screen TV, new cars, etc.).

Danny-
1. Check your spelling before you post.
2. Sorry your parents were not responsible enough to save up for your college. I understand they needed that above-ground pool and flat screen TV. Scholarships? You mean that thing that punishes the middle-class and rewards the lower-class for being what they are? Great.

@..Freeland
1.) Check your ego at the door.
2.) Im sorry you live in reality that was given to you with a silverspoon in your mouth, anyways thats what it sounds like to me. Parents giving their kids things as they grow up is normal. A 2500 dollar pool and a 900 dollar flatscreen hardly consitutes your condesending BS towards Danny.
3.) Scholarship recipients have gone on to invent, cure, help cure many ailments plus have had major impact in space exploration, geology, biology ect...
4.) Now that the edcuation process has become a business, not everyone will have access to it. Everyone should have access to higher education. It only will help society as a whole as more people have this access.

@Freeland

RESPONSIBLE enough to save up for college? Explain to me how a mother raising children with a husband who has been unemployed for 7 years due to crippling medical conditions is acting irresponsibly when she budgets her money every month and has some months where she barely has enough to pay for groceries. Flat screen TV you say? Try a 27&quot;tv set comfortably in the tiny living room of a row-home. Now obviously here, I would assume your response would be&quot;well she has the choice to go work somewhere else and make more money&quot;. She is a nurse, and to do so would need to further HER education, which entails paying HER tuition when she has her CHILDREN&apos;S tuition taking up her first priority. You are ignorant and idiotic for assuming everyone who takes on student loans is a result of irresponsible parenting. I was raised to appreciate everything my parents were able to give me, when and if they were able to. I worked through college to pay for my boarding, graduated with a business degree that was earned via my student loans, and will be entering a job late this summer with an extremely comfortable salary. If your ignorance is any indicator of the lifestyle you were raised in I will go ahead and assume that you have absolutely no idea how stressful it is for parents to support their children in the best way possible when all other living expenses have been cut down to the bare minimum. Think before you speak and give some credit to those who have experienced decades of hard times but still managed to instil a hardworking mindset in their children.

Unlike others, my family was never well-off enough to save money for a mini-vacation let alone my college fund. . It is easier than you may think to get trapped in debt here in the US. However, a good portion can be due to neglect. I don&apos;t often see many people who had a family well enough to save for their college, so they borrow or they save to get the education that in a recession may not even be worth the work and pain of it. At least we have the opportunity to save and scrimp to go to college. All that man wanted was to get married. $110. Do you think he had much of a choice later on in life when his children were hungry and his low position in life could not make the money to buy the food to provide them with enough sustenance to comfortably be alive? Where was his choice? Did he really even have a choice to begin with? We may not be as well off as we pretend, but to compare us with them is sick. Slavery is a problem. I agree we shouldn&apos;t ignore home-land issues, but to ignore the violation of basic human rights is atop the list of crimes against humanity. Turning the blind-eye in selfishness is worse than having never seen outside your blinders.

@ Freeland

You really think that because someone has irresponsible parents that the children don&apos;t deserve a better life? It&apos;s certainly not the childs fault. I guess you think you are better than every one because your parents were better off?
 June 3, 2011 at 1:28 pm | Rigel54 

Everybody&apos;s a bit right in this. Parents who work hard and sacrifice (me) to put their kids through college do deserve some respect, and their kids do&quot;deserve it&quot;a bit more, it was earned. Those less fortunate do deserve a chance to earn their place. If they work hard in high school they can earn scholarships (1 of mine did). If they are very successful their very poverty becomes an asset, as many fine schools give complete to nearly complete free rides (which my very accomplished kids were not eligible for, someone at my economic level has earned the right to pay 40% of their income instead. Student loans are pretty reasonable. Some parents who are able do spend their money on fine cars, big TVs, and other luxuries. It&apos;s not their kids fault (though they enjoy the lifestyle), but their parents made the choice. They still have scholarships, grants, and loans. Another road is to work for a high quality private college. Many grant their employees full tuition. We went that route, 20 years work for two tuitions to one of the countries best universities (though 1 kid could have gone anywhere anyway).

This post is in reply to Eddie and all the others who are shocked, shocked I tell you to find the wonderful system of student loans and grants that made higher education possible throughout the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s has disappeared. Say&quot;thank you, Ronald Regan&quot;, but don&apos;t blame anyone else. There used to be The Dept of HEW-health, education and welfare–and it benefited EVERYONE. The GOP decided to focus the country&apos;s attention on what were very few&quot;welfare queens&quot;–and talked their constituency into making a hew and cry about&quot;money going to the undeserved&quot;. Mr Reagan then dismantled HEW, split into separate depts, the better to focus on the&quot;welfare&quot;part. And thus we have...2011, and the disentigration of what had been easy access to higher education and student loans that DID NOT require parents to save for their children&apos;s education. I mean how much can you save and for how many children on a middle class salary? All this was done with nary a peep from your parents. They were too busy trying to dismantle affirmative action. So now, balck kids can&apos;t afford college, white kids can&apos;t afford college and no one will tell the truth why!

$110 in rural India 20 something years ago was an enormous amount. In terms of purchasing power, it could have been equivalent to thousands of dollars in todays US consumer market. In fact, it was a for marrying his wife (think of dowdry and wedding celebration)–something that would saddle a lot of US consumers for years. Besides, the laborer in the article has borrowed additional amounts periodically.

The real difference is that he has to work up to 14 hours a day, and many of us who do have jobs have to work 10 hours a day, that&apos;s why it appears the guy is enslaved. But objectively, we aren&apos;t much better off.

 June 3, 2011 at 7:39 pm | NotTheSame 

VR13 I agree with you that it $100 20 years ago in India was a large sum of money, but the difference is culture and laws. In the States, no matter how far we get in debt, we can always file bankruptcy and start over. Sure, certain debts can&apos;t be bankrupted like student loans and IRS debt, but even if those lead to garnished wages, there is a limit to what percent can be garnished. I don&apos;t think think there are any parallels to the situation the author illustrates vs our standard of living. We could never be forced to be slaves to our debt, to HAVE to work 14 hours per day OR ELSE.
 June 3, 2011 at 10:31 pm | Kay 

I am appalled by the many people here who think there&apos;s any comparison between school loans in the US and loans such as those discussed in this article. Entire families for generations are trapped into paying off loans with 100% annual interest rates with the&quot;terms of repayment&quot;being that the entire family must work 14 hour days 7 days a week until the lender&quot;says&quot;the loan is paid off. There are no legal protections. There are no safety nets. Here you get to read the loan agreement and get monthly updates. There you get nothing but what the lender says...and he says whatever he wants in order to keep you in perpetual bondage.

Oh, and for the&quot;many of us who do have jobs have to work 10 hours a day, that&apos;s why it appears the guy is enslaved. But objectively, we aren&apos;t much better off&quot;...this is also an absurd thing to claim. Objectively you are FAR better off than these people. You have enough food to eat...and can get food stamps, utilize food pantries, or eat at soup kitchens if needed to supplement what you can buy from your earnings. And you live in a home with indoor plumbing, hot and cold running water, electricity 24 hours a day, central heating...you do not live in a hut. And if you need help with that, you can get housing and utility assistance. You have access to high quality medical care...and it&apos;s available to you free if you can&apos;t afford it.

Most Americans are ignorant of conditions in other parts of the world even though they have access to the Internet so, from the comfort of their own home, can read reports and studies on poverty, can read newspapers and magazines from other countries, not from the American point of view, can watch videos, can communicate with Peace Corps volunteers, can access data and compare it appropriately to that of the US. Even if you can&apos;t afford to go to another country, you can still learn about living conditions. And if you *do* go to another country, at least take a cab ride outside of the tourist areas to see what the place *really* looks like. See where and how people *really* live.

Unfortunately, most of you haven&apos;t even been in a real slum in the US. That&apos;s bad enough...but not as bad as Third World slums.

I wonder how much of the the bonded labor accounts for India&apos;s current economic growth. If the gains from bonded labor is negligible than India deserves credit for its current economic boom. If bonded labor is an important part of it current economic status, than its economic boom is no real achievement at all. Either way it needs to be answerable for the use of bonded labor. The world should hold India accountable for it slave labor practices.

The difference is that students who take out loans are most likely very ambitious and have the desire to go to school, or else it wouldn&apos;t make any sense for them to go into debt for the sake of obtaining an education. Of course there are stupid people who take out loans for granted and still waste time doing irrelevant things other than learn.

Going to school and using your brain for 14 hours a day is in no way comparable to working 14 hours of hard labor. Using your brain to learn things that interest you is the easiest thing you could possibly wish for in life. People around the globe who are in the situations as dire as being bonded to labor for life, would give an arm and a leg to go to school and learn. Whereas in more advanced countries, children and adults have the opportunity to learn but would rather play World of Warcraft, PS3, Xbox and Wii or using their silly little-square-cancer-in-a-boxes 13 out of 14 hours of their day.

Your comment that many people in the US take education for granted is right on.

Also (to introduce a conspiracy theory for discussion here), is it possible that some do not want educational opportunities to be prevalent? Are&quot;classes&quot;a requirement (or are they thought to be such by some in power) for the overall prosperity of a nation, nations, or the human race?

And why don&apos;t people discuss Zero Population Growth and birth control any more? It seems that whenever there are discussions about poverty this is the&quot;elephant in the room.&quot;At what point does the viability of the continuation of the human-species as a whole supersede an individual&apos;s reproductive&quot;right.&quot;China is often greatly condemned for its one-child policy, but perhaps the Chinese–in this one regard–are the pragmatists who are on track with reality. Barring a disaster of some sort to reduce the human population, every nation on earth likely will be calling up the People&apos;s Republic to get their playbook.

A student loan in the U.S. is different because the rate of interest is not exploitive and you can apply for bankruptcy to get out of the loan.

 Bankruptcy 

Nope, student loans are one of the few debts you can&apos;t declare bankruptcy from. Still, it is different from indentured labor because the debt and the labor are not interconnected and there are laws in place dictating maximum interest rate and payment terms.
 June 3, 2011 at 10:31 am | HH 

US bankruptcy code does not allow for forgiveness of student loans–it follow you until you keel over. Fortunately it does not automatically transfer to next of kin (however, if there are assets in the estate, the creditors will have a very real claim).
 June 3, 2011 at 10:32 am | Z 

@ Rob... You need to check your facts! You CANNOT get out of repaying college loans by declaring bankruptcy. Nice try tho!
 June 3, 2011 at 12:03 pm | Mick 

Actually, Rob is correct. Student Loans CAN be discharged in bankruptcy, if three conditions are met:
1. The debtor cannot be benefiting economically from the education which the student loan paid for.
2. Nor can the debtor expect to benefit from it in the future.
3. Re-payment of the loan would represent an extreme financial hardship to the debtor, and would therefore defeat the&quot;fresh start&quot;intent of the bankruptcy.

Of course, it requires an adversarial hearing, and normally an attorney to argue the case, but this is actually one of the most misunderstood aspects of the bankruptcy code.
 June 3, 2011 at 6:07 pm | Kay 

As usual, some people present their opinions as facts without bothering to making sure they&apos;re correct...after all, things change and we&apos;re all wrong at times. The odd part is that they&apos;re sitting at a computer while typing their erroneous opinions, so double-checking would be easy. But nooooo.

Fortunately there are also people like Rob and Mick actually take the time to make sure they&apos;re being accurate. Unfortunately, even with those corrections, most people are going to continue spreading their FALSE information about bankruptcy and school loans because that&apos;s what they *want* to believe. Yeesh.
 June 4, 2011 at 4:05 pm | Danger Man 

The two people above are right: you CAN discharge student debt in bankruptcy.

What they didn&apos;t expressly say, however, is that it&apos;s virtually impossible. You&apos;re probably more likely to have it discharged through civil service, death or serious (and permanent) disability.

So for practically everyone dealing with student loan debt...no, you can&apos;t, for all intents and purposes, discharge it in bankruptcy. It just isn&apos;t a realistic possibility.

@ Eddie

Eddie has a point here. While the differences between S.E. Asian bondage and US student (and general population) indebtedness are not trivial, it is nieve to assume that US creditors do not apply, equally, by threat or by action, a very legal violence towards non-payers (by violence I mean forcible eviction from homes, removal of the means of sustenance, jail, etc). The intent in the US is not to create slaves, it is to remove moral hazard and ensure prompt payment of debt which is the basis for our modern credit-economy. But the effect is the same: keep the rabbits running...

Actually, the supreme court recently ruled that the government has no authority to place limits on the amount of interest someone can charge. 33% annual interest rate used to be the point it became loansharking but these payday loan scams charge in effect upwards of 300% and there is no legal recourse. I believe that it is much more subtle here in the United States but large companies like ConAgra exploit illegal aliens in much the same way. They pay an hourly wage that seems adaquate but then put them up in a line of single wide trailers on their property (10-15 per trailer) charge them exorbitant rates for rent and for food, work them long hours and pay them for fewer, make quotas that are not possible and look the other way when they have their children helping in the fields. This occurs on mega-farms all over the country. Student loans may be similar in a stretch of the imagination but the exploitation of immigrants here in America is exactly the same.

I disagree completely. When I first started school back in 2002, interest rates were high, especially for private loans&gt;18%. Unlucky for me, I HAD NO CREDIT WHEN I WAS 18. So I was penalized because I had no cosigner. To this day, I am still paying $1000+ a month for my student loan debt, and I will be for the next 20 years. At least I became an Engineer and make decent money, but it still hurts every month when I pay my loans and realize how little my principle is going down...

I grew up in a lower middle income house, I worked hard in school and I went to a state university (on my own dime) and earned a degree in accounting. I have never had a problem finding a job in the 7 years I have been out of school and with my 6 figure salary, that student loan I took out is paid off.

The fat cats get fatter if the public owns cars, houses, boats, and a slew of credit cards. While this certainly creates a version of financial slavery, it is no doubt no comparison to working 14 hrs per day with barely enough food and water. Quite the contrary, even those of us very much so enslaved financially to US banks for our loans, we have it far better.

He doesn&apos;t even live in the US, and it sounds like he lives in an area where there is no use for cars, homes, or education for the majority of the people who live there, who are likely very poor. Keep your critiques of how one should spend their money or take their loans out to the regions they belong. Your point may be valid for people in the United States, or other countries with advanced banking and technology, but not for third-world areas whose people grow up poor and working, marry poor and working, and die poor and working...Because that is what the generation before them did, and the generation before them, and on and on. It&apos;s what their children and their children&apos;s children will do, unless someone sweeps in and teaches them how to change their system. And as the current world situation shows, change does not happen overnight. The man wanted a wife, she was valuable to him in some way, just as your car, your education, or your home is to you.

Actually, it is understandable that acquiring a mate would be one of a young man&apos;s very highest priorities. A person who lets poverty prevent them from doing so is likely a failure in Darwinian terms. The silly thing is that marriage is simply a status that has no inherent material requirement to enter into. All that is required is the agreement of the man, the woman, their respective families, the seal of the local civil/religious authority, and then sexual intercourse. An extravagant ceremony that sinks the newlyweds into destitution should not be part of the equation.

Your student loan isn&apos;t showing up at your doorstep to beat you. Your student loan isn&apos;t monopolizing the local grocery and making sure prices are set at a level you could never afford. Your student loan isn&apos;t held by your employer who has no incentive to give you a raise because you can&apos;t leave that employer. Your student loan doesn&apos;t have a 100% interest rate. Maybe actually dig into what bonded servitude really looks like before you complain about how bad your student loans are while wondering how to lose those extra pounds from the Memorial Day picnic.

Actually, student loans are now owned by the Federal Department of Education. Most of the funds that are used for DOE student loans come from bonds that are sold to teacher/faculty pension funds... So in actuality, these college students are mostly indebted to their teachers and the school and college administrators at a reasonable rate of interest and a reasonable cost... That was the case, anyway, until Wall Street decided to recklessly play with and ruin the old system for the sake of profits... Enter Madoff.

There is an actual answer to this... the article defines debt bondage as&quot;bonded labor involves the exploitive interlinking of credit and labor agreements&quot;. In the case of a student, the creditor (the bank) is not the same as the employer (unless you go on to work for the bank that lent you the money, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about). In the case of the farmer, the creditor and the employer are both the landowner.

Not really, @eddie2010 and @bao The article speak to exploitative loans, not loans or debt in general. Fixed rate loans are exactly that, and anyone can reject accepting a loan. High interest rates are available in the US, but those rates/loans are reflective of the borrower&apos;s credit. There is still a capitalist element to those high interest rate loans, but the borrowers are considered to be high risk. Student loans are offered at a low fixed rate, and if you qualify for a FHA loan you can get a mortgage at 3%, but you have to have really good credit. But you can still get a bank mortgage for 4-6%. Not an awful deal. Credit cards can be risky, but if you pay your minimum payment every month they won&apos;t mess with your interest rate. Yes, you can lose your home if you don&apos;t pay your mortgage, but then again, shouldn&apos;t you? You don&apos;t get it for free if you stop paying. The loans mentioned in the article above are essentially loan sharking, which is illegal in the US, and is so because of their exploitative nature, and the near impossibility of fulfilling the debt obligation.

I am just blown away by some of the insane comments of my&quot;fellow&quot;Americans. The fact that anyone could draw a parallel between this sort of indentured servitude and student loans, mortgages, etc. here in the US is absolutely mind-boggling to the nth degree.

Does anyone beat you near-to-death if you take a break while working? Are you existing on a few ounces of water and a couple of pieces of bread each day? If you drop dead at work, does someone drag your body to the side of the field for the animals to gnaw on (once they&apos;ve stripped you of clothes and anything else you might have on you, of course)? If you are injured at work, are you left to sit there and bleed to death? Will your children, grandchildren, great-grand-children, etc. be living in the same conditions endlessly because of the debt YOU incurred? Do you work 14+ hours a day without breaks for meals, bathroom needs, etc.? Are you toothless because the only&quot;good&quot;teeth you ever had rotted out of your mouth by the time you were 10 and there was nothing to be done about it?

You&apos;re sitting there in your comfortable housing, reading the news online, posting your ridiculous comments, enjoying your time off (or maybe freely posting from work when you should be doing other things)... you will lay your head down in a comfortable bed tonight... go to the fridge and grab a cool drink when you want it... sit down on the toilet and surf the web on your phone while you do your business... hop in your car and grab McDonalds when you&apos;re hungry... post on Facebook about how your cat puked up a hairball that looks like the Virgin Mary... and forget about the fact that these people even exist, smugly telling yourself how well you understand their plight...that they should just suck it up.

The biggest difference is that the student loan was made presumably in the USA while the bonded laborer is in India. See, in the USA, we don&apos;t have a rigid caste system that predetermines a person&apos;s socio-economic&amp;professional life. I can recognize that the USA is wrought with inequalities, but the two situations do not resemble eachother in the slightest, aside from the fact that money was borrowed. It is flippin stupid to ignore the cultural milieu of the borrowers in the completely juvenile parallel you tried to make. Don&apos;t want lots of college debt...? Go to a cheap school.

I&apos;m in the same boat with this poor guy. Student loans of about 100K for a degree that&apos;s worth less than truck drivers make. DO NOT allow your kids to take those loans. There are zero protections. If you default, your world goes to heck in a handbasket.

I understand what this guy is dealing with and I live in the US! If I paid every student debt (plus the 50% the collections people added), I wouldn&apos;t be able to eat. So I pay most of it, but the rest keeps stacking up. I work a low-income job. As a result of my trusting previous self, I will never be able to achieve anything.

If you don&apos;t want to be in debt, don&apos;t go there, simple! Instead of getting easy credit cards and maxing them out, pay them off and don&apos;t use them except for an emergency. It will take some will power but you can do it. Think of it this way, you have fallen into the&quot;instant gratification&quot;mode and have to have this or that, why? Advertising and slaes teasing by the merchants. So you doin&apos;t have the latest gizmo, does it still work and do the job? Why get rid of it. Our society has fallen into the instant gratification trap, has also forgoten how to fix things, like a pair of shoes, a car, a computer, or even a marriage. If it appears to be broken or does not work as good, we trash it and get another one, why? Save your money. Instead of falling into the debt trap change your view of things, and say to yourself, if I cannot afford to pay cash for the item, then I cannot afford it yet. When you can afford to pay cash for something you also have barganing power to get what ever it is for a cheaper price in most cases. If you have credit cards and want to use them be sure to pay 100% off each month and you will not get hit with outrageous fees at the end of the month. You will end up with record of your purchases for tax time and life remains good. I use credit cards responsibly, I never carry cash, and I pay it off at the end of the month. I have 3 or 4 credit cards with better than a $10K credit limit on each, but I only use one and pay it off each month. I drive a car that is 8 years old with a free title, and own a house that yes, it is mortgaged but I own only $115K on it. I never get behind becasue I have the payment taken out of my paycheck each month. Life is good and I am able to give the grand kids a $500 savings bond for each birthday and a $1000 for christening, able to take vacations for 3 weeks and travel all over the world. Why, becasue I do not owe my soul to the company store and I am not totally a slave to the easy to slide into modern day slave system.

The difference is how power is exerted. The bank has the power to seize assets, but we don&apos;t have to work for the bank until the debt is paid off, with pay and interest structures designed to keep us from ever paying it off. Also, if we really do get to a point where we simply can&apos;t pay it off, there are legal remedies we can pursue (even student loans can now be forgiven in extreme cases of insolvency). It&apos;s in the bank&apos;s best interest to get the loan back *eventually,* even if it&apos;s also in their best interest to design fees to make the loan linger for a while. When you&apos;re working for the person who loaned you the money, on the condition that you have to work for them until all loans are paid off (and, as the article points out, without any obligation of the lender&apos;s part to tell you how much you still owe), it&apos;s in the lender&apos;s best interest to keep the loan going forever. It&apos;s possible that Haresh&apos;s loans were paid off five years ago but the land-owner just hasn&apos;t felt like telling him.

The difference is rule of law. There is nothing inherently wrong with borrowing and repaying and interest itself is not the problem. But imagine a banker knocking on the door of a household in the US and saying:&quot;Hi there. I&apos;m so glad you decided to get a student loan with us. Now you, your spouse, and all of your children belong to me. Come with me to my factory where you will work 14 hours days without pay. Of course, you&apos;ll need to eat, and since I won&apos;t be paying you, you&apos;ll have to rely on me to provide food. And I will - barely enough to keep you all from starving at for an outrageous amount of money that I&apos;ll add to your original debt. And if you protest, or don&apos;t work hard enough, or if I just feel like it, I&apos;ll beat you.&quot;

If that happened here, we would call the police. There would be lawsuits. And it would make headlines. Because in the US, for all the flaws our system has, we have a firm rule of law.

Bonded labor (slavery) is illegal in every country in the world, but in some places people can not trust that those entrusted with enforcing the laws will have the means or the will to do it. This opens the door for the strong to prey on the weak.

It&apos;s incredibly different. For one thing the reason why mortgages are so bad in the US is because people buy far more than they need. In the situation profiled here a family is mortgaging their basic needs. Additionally because there is a lack of usury laws the debt spirals out of control. It&apos;s the difference between getting a loan from Chase versus getting a loan from Tony Soprano. At Chase you will, or could if you aren&apos;t greedy, one day own your house.

When you sign on the dotted line of a legal agreement representing either a mortgage or student loan, you know EXACTLY what you are getting into. You have informed consent. Nobody is forcing you to take out a student loan or mortgage and if you don&apos;t like the terms offered, you have the freedom to seek out a different lender. We also have rule of law here. When banks violate their terms, you can take them to court. Bonded laborers have no contract, no oversight and no hope. It is night and day. With sub-prime mortages, don&apos;t forget that just because someone is foolishly lending you more money than you both know you can pay back doesn&apos;t mean you should take it. Fault is EQUALLY on both sides there.

If you don&apos;t want to be&quot;enslaved&quot;by student loans or mortgages, you can choose to not take advantage of the flexibility granted by such institutions. Maybe you can pay your own way through college, or maybe you can rent an apartment for the rest of your life. Nothing wrong with that.

well for one, a loan made from a bank is out of your own free will...what happened in america is a collective effort from all the americans by not being fiscally responsible. In India though, it is a different story. They are being bonded for the basic necessities you guys take for granted like basic medicine.

Why blame a bank for a mortgage that you took? At the end of the day it was your decision to take the loan and if you cannot repay our take a second mortgage out of your property then that is just wrong.

So, @Not always,

Are you paying $100 a month on that credit card to get it paid off in 5 months with interest? Or are you paying the minimum monthly amount, which means it will take years to pay off?

And what about the second job you took so as to earn some more money, however small the paycheck, to spend entirely on getting out of debt? Is that helping...or have you not gotten a second job because you don&apos;t want to work for minimum wage?

Oh...and what about going to the free government-sponsored credit counseling agency in your area that can help people consolidate and pay off their debts? Have you talked with them yet? Found out how they can help you?

Obviously you *do* pay off at least some of your debts...I applaud you for that...but what are you doing to get your debt under control?

I know way too many people who won&apos;t get a second job because, for example, it&apos;s at a fast food restaurant and they&apos;d *only* get paid $7.50 an hour. Of course, $300 a month extra income that was totally spent on debt repayment would get them out of debt *years* sooner...but they refuse to do it. They&apos;d rather whine about having to pay off debts and high interest rates that they themselves incurred.

I immediately thought the same exact thing. I think if President Obama and Congress actually want to stimulate the economy, we need to forgive all student debt, public and private. Other nations give free higher education to the smart, hard working students. Here, students must take loans and end out forever being unable to kickstart a career, start a family, get a house, etc. It is really debt bondage.

Our nation finances wars, not education. We see where that has gotten us. Time to revise the priorities.

WRONG! Indian parents that have a clue scrape it together and make sure their sons and (to a lesser extent) their daughters become highly educated and then they send them to the USA to become physicians, scientists and engineers and they go from peasant class to upper class in one generation. Education is the key to success. If only the dum dums born and raised in the USA knew that. We have subcultures here that continue to enslave themselves in hard times because they reject education because education, apparently, is&quot;white&quot;. I guess Indian and Chinese people don&apos;t think so because almost all the scientists and engineers in the USA are from these countries. Wake up dum dums. The only slaveowners here are you enslaving your own children.

They are probably in debt for tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars by now.

 From India... 

Problem is... these poor people dont even know that something like micro-lending exists. The feudal landlord is the only authority people like Haresh know. This landlord is their government, their bank, their justice system all rolled into one.
This lack of knowledge is exploited at various levels by these landlords. The landlord even dictates where Haresh gets his drinking water. Add to that the strict caste system which forbids Haresh from getting water from the nearby well and this water source could be miles away from Haresh&apos;s house. Considering that he and his family have to spend hours doing hard labor in the landlords fields, getting this drikning water, from miles away, is a privilege they cant afford everyday.

Its sad to see a lot of commenters here ridiculing Haresh for taking a loan for his marriage. Unlike the West, in rural India there is a social obligation to get married. God forbid if Haresh has a daughter!
The father of a girl has to take a similar loan for his daughter&apos;s marrige. Again, unlike the Western idea of&apos;Marriage&apos;, for the uneducated poor and rural fathers in India, getting a daughter married is their sole and primary responsibility. Even here the landlord and the strict caste system dictate who and at what age (usually before 18) she can and should marry.

During general elections, these landlords dictate who gets Haresh&apos;s vote. Haresh doesnot have any education to understand who he is voting for. So, Haresh and his family put the stamp on a symbol that his landlord asked him to. He does not even know that he has the freedom to choose. No freedom of choice!

Even an uneducated westerner knows his freedoms. Not only knows but from some of the comments here looks like these freedoms have been taken for granted and are regularly abused.

As rightly mentioned by the author, the cultural and social revolutions that didnot happen in the East have a lot to do with the current situation. Lack of primary education is the second reason for this situation. Deeply entrenched currouption is the third.

For someone who has taken the freedoms and opportunities available to them for granted there can be no further explaination of the situation of the millions of&apos;Haresh&apos;s in India. I have empathy for Haresh but I pity the&apos;civilized&apos;,&apos;cultured&apos;and&apos;educated&apos;people who cannot understand his destituteness.

That&apos;s why Islam has outlawed this phenomena (interest system) centuries ago. But modern day banking, personal loans etc. are still following the same pattern, hence forcing the needy to agree to tough terms&amp;conditions. The result, as we see is the slavery–spanning over generations.
The person or family who have been&apos;trapped&apos;or bound by such loan need some way out and would obviously do anything to free themselves. Recruitment by extremists in return of money is also an example.

get real: you need to have interest in order to keep the money going, without interest nobody would be willing to lend money to other people (and risk not getting it back).
islamic banking also charges customers for loans, but they are hypocrite and call it a&apos;fee&apos;instead of&apos;interest&apos;.

the problem with those&apos;slaves&apos;isn&apos;t interest as such, but outrageous interest that is in no way connected to any realistic measure of risk.
i agree that charging such high levels of interest is immoral: the lender actively tries to keep those borrowers poor and ignorant.

I am 62 and worked my whole life. Long ago, I realized that work for someone else is a type of slavery. Each person is a business and each person trades his time and labor for money. Since everyone is dependent on a steady stream of money, he can&apos;t usually quit without sever repercussions. Working for someone usually entails doing what the employer wants, without any complaints. Many times, such things as when the person can go to the bathroom, eat, talk about, and wear are controlled by the employer. Some companies even dictate what products the employee can use. Then, if you are sick, if you take time off, you may be fired. The degree to which an employee must give up their freedom is variable, but when you work for someone, all employees are required to work certain hours. Even jobs that people think are wonderful, require personal sacrifice. Most gladly trade freedom for money, since it provides a certain standard of living. However, make no mistake, every employee is a slave to some extent. That is why I retired as soon as I could, which was at age 59. Now, I do what I want, when I want. I never had complete freedom until I retired.

We must learn to live within our means and have patience. Most people get into trouble when they want to have something they cannot afford. I am 44 and completely debt free. In fact other people owe me money of which some of it I will never get back. Amongst our siblings, we chipped in to help buy houses for each other interest free. But all this required some patience which most people do not have. Currently, over 50% of Americans would not be able to come up with $2000 in case of emergency and the US is supposed to be the richest country in the world. I say B*S.

The man paid $110 for a woman, John Edwards paid far more, and look what it might cost him, even the guy who borrowed $110 went back and borrowed more..so he did not learn his lesson...

In the USA we have Welfare and it is a way of life, wish we could put them to work...instead of producing more babies.

DONT TAKE THE LOAN IF YOU CAN&apos;T REPAY IT. ALSO IF HE WAS WORTH MORE TO ANYONE ELSE THEN HE COULD HAVE GOT BETTER TERMS ON THE LOAN. MANY PEOPLE ARE STARVING IN INDIA, HE HAS A HUT, FOOD AND MEDICINE. LOOKS LIKE HE WILL STILL OWE MONEY WHEN HE DIES. THE LAND OWNER IS THE ONE WITH A BAD DEAL AS HE WILL NEVER GET THE LOAN PAID OFF.

DO YOU WORK FOR A BANK? OR MAYBE ON WALL STREET OR FOR A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY... You see some of us on the planet have humanitarian values, we see that there are some basic principles to stand up for. We dont like to live in an animalistic world where we have to fight for every little breath while a FEW rise to the top. We like the thought of humanly leveling the playing field so that all of people have rights like LIFE, LIBERTY, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. This makes life less stressful and better for ALL PEOPLE and the planet NOT JUST YOU.

Are you nuts? The loan has been paid off many, many times over. Landowners like this one take advantage of uneducated illiterate low caste laborers who have zero knowledge of laws, banking, finance, or that what the landowner has done is ILLEGAL. (You apparently missed that tidbit.)

And the hut, food, medicine the laborer has? The landowner owns the hut. And the worker had to take loans out from the landowner to pay for food and medicine because all his alleged&quot;wages&quot;go toward&quot;paying off&quot;the&quot;loans&quot;.

You also seemed to miss the tidbit that the landowner doesn&apos;t lose anything when the laborer dies...because the worker&apos;s children and grandchildren are *still* responsible for&quot;paying off&quot;the loan.

I disagree completely with the comments on here. When I first started school back in 2002, interest rates were high, especially for private loans&gt;18%. Unlucky for me, I HAD NO CREDIT WHEN I WAS 18. So I was penalized because I had no cosigner. To this day, I am still paying $1000+ a month for my student loan debt, and I will be for the next 20 years. At least I became an Engineer and make decent money, but it still hurts every month when I pay my loans and realize how little my principle is going down...

. It is easier than you may think to get trapped in debt here in the US. However, a good portion can be due to neglect. I don&apos;t often see many people who had a family well enough to save for their college, so they borrow or they save to get the education that in a recession may not even be worth the work and pain of it. At least we have the opportunity to save and scrimp to go to college. All that man wanted was to get married. $110. Do you think he had much of a choice later on in life when his children were hungry and his low position in life could not make the money to buy the food to provide them with enough sustenance to comfortably be alive? Where was his choice? Did he really even have a choice to begin with? We may not be as well off as we pretend, but to compare us with them is sick. Slavery is a problem. I agree we shouldn&apos;t ignore home-land issues, but to ignore the violation of basic human rights is atop the list of crimes against humanity. Turning the blind-eye in selfishness is worse than having never seen outside your blinders.

To live within your means is to assume that you have enough means to live within in the first place. He wanted a wife and more than to be alone and still in poverty. He could very well have been in poverty either way, but you are saying it is stupid to reach beyond what you have in order to try and gain more. The issue is with the power imbalance and ridiculousness of a life of slavery over what is equal to a high-school student&apos;s part time paychecks. NOT with the man&apos;s ambitions toward having a life. No, it wasn&apos;t a wise choice to take out the loan. That was never in question. However, when there is no other means to achieve a better life than the horrid option, he can either live within his means alone in a hut or aspire to have a partner and reach beyond it in the ambitious idea that maybe life can hold more than that.

in 20Yrs $120 will become $19542

Now if you take $250,000 loan (in india or usa) today and dont pay for it - what could happen to you ?

sorry guys i am not justifying slavery, but if you work at $12 a day just calculate how many days/yrs (it comes to 15 yrs to be precise) you have to work–call it a slavery or job - freedom of choice of your words, in USA we call it a job with extended hours in developing world we call it slavery.

 From India... 

India got its freedom in 1947 after being occupied for more than a century by the then superpower–Britan. It has taken America about 300 years to get where it is now after independence from the same nation–Britan.
Yes India has been around for much more than 300 years but the occupation sapped its economic, material, cultural and social resources. America finds it difficult to get out of a recession caused by economic policies that were implented by elected representative governments in the last dacade or two may be three. Imagine how difficult it is to undo a century old exploitation by a foreign country.
Recently it was Boeing who was begging India to buy its outdated fighters. It is companies like Du Pont and Monsanto who are pushing for their Genetically Engineered seeds to be used by Indian farmers to sustain the Walmart supply-chain. That means that currently the farms are growing&quot;organic&quot;produce but cant sell it as&quot;organic&quot;in the international market as it does not conform to the arbitrary criteria setup by first world standards organizations. As much as the tax dollars need to be kept within America, I would suggest that even the toxic waste created by American consumers be kept within America rather than sending it half way around the world for Indian child-laborers to be dismantled in unhygenic conditions. Hey those are American jobs being deported to third world countires rt? Oh and while you are at it keep those Asbestos laden ships built in the 1950s too. That would add jobs and also create a new market for the Health insurers ... what prosperity!!!

We got that in the USA;&quot;Check Cashing&quot;for instance, a by-product of banks refusing to lend to anyone who actually could use a loan.

Why should we care about people in Unga Bunga land when we got our own economy being messed up (in a small part) by people who end up&quot;Slaves to parasites&quot;and while you mock them this money just goes in some already very rich person&apos;s bank account, not the local stores/business that comes around to all of us who actually work?

Too bad these&quot;Moralist Crusaders&quot;fight against Human Trafficking, only succeeding in slowing it in the USA a bit and criminalizing it more.

Used to be a lot of Asian ladies (and central American) got into the USA as&quot;S–Slaves&quot;. Like going to this guy&quot;Hey! In debt? I&apos;ll buy off your daughter and pay well more than you owe...&quot;Then he&apos;d get a cute little (and I mean even adult) squeeze toy that&apos;d behave like a woman when most women were getting&quot;Liberated&quot;and she&apos;d become an American citizen once she dropped a brat or two. Good trade off, even in the 50s men didn&apos;t like to be brutal to ladies, they liked to work hard and provide for them, where overseas it&apos;s called&quot;A worthless female&quot;.

Unless you have a family or health obligation, there is NO reason you can&apos;t get a piece of the warped&quot;American Dream&quot;I keep hearing about. From my perspective, many in this country seems to ridicule and scorn the&quot;rich&quot;for having things handed to them on a silver platter, while they themselves lounge around in their laziness and feign surprise when things aren&apos;t handed to them too. What did you expect? You want something. Go get it.

Obviously there are exceptions and families legitimately struggling to get by.

If the laborer is not educated, and decides to take everything his owner says as the truth, then hey, something&apos;s wrong. Don&apos;t blame the state for personal character flaws.

(the author only spoke about India? Is that a personal bias? Since he appears to be of Indian origin, research seems to have been vacations back home?

THOSE DARNED ISRAELIS ARE AT IT AGAIN!
ISRAEL&apos;S IDF MEDICAL CLINIC STARTS WORK IN TSUNAMI-STRICKEN MIYAGI
PREFECTURE OF JAPAN
CNN:&quot;Israel is first to set up Surgical Unit in Japan&quot;
The Israeli clinic includes orthopedics, surgical and intensive care
units as well as a delivery room and pharmacy.
The delegation includes 50 doctors.
They brought with them:
1. 32 tons of equipment
2. 18 tons of humanitarian aid-10,000 coats, 6,000 gloves and 150
portable toilets.

NOTE: With all their billions of&quot;petro-dollars&quot;, where is the
humanitarian relief from the Arab countries?
They don&apos;t help others in need,–instead, It is being invested in
death, destruction and mayhem throughout the civilized world.

Where would he have bolted to? On what money would he have bolted with? What would the lender have done to the rest of the family if he bolted? Who would have better helped him somewhere else without doing the same thing? Sometimes we forget the meaning of freedom we have here in the USA. Banks and credit lenders are getting their hooks in us, but we are still free to shake them!

US Military has been in the process of slavery for years. You sign a contract that once you sign it you can&apos;t get out. If you do get out you are tossed in to jail. Then you finish your time, if not more time, behind bars. You may think that the military is just a job, it is not. We can&apos;t leave if we want to. Enlisted men and women are slaves to the government. We are entrapped in a system that keeps you hostage for 8-30 years. Let it be known that when you do get out that your subject to recall at any time. Navy calls it fleet reserve Army, Air Force and Marines retired reserves. They can recall you any time they want and if you don&apos;t show up you go to jail. The rest of the world isn&apos;t the only ones promoting slavery the US Government is pushing it as well. A truly free system would let their people go when they feel what their doing is either wrong or they don’t want to do their job any more.
American citizens throw out words about honor, dignity, and integrity. What honor is there if a man is forced to work with the threat of jail if he does not work? Where is the dignity for the country making it’s people work under a threat. Where is the integrity in a system that pushes freedom and democracy if you can’t let people go if they realized they made a mistake or are at the end of their road and need to get out of the system?
Not that posting on a message board will matter. The US Government will still say they promote all volunteer military but truth of the mater is a real volunteer and un-volunteer them self’s if they feel the job their doing is wrong or they do not want to pursue the current job their doing.

I read about something similiar in India only the family worked as brickmakers and their 5 yr old daughter had to work also. I thought about contacting the reporter and seeing if I could pay off the debt for them. But I tried to look ahead. If they paid off the debt, would they still have a job? The brick company has, in effect, free labor and certainly would not pay the family if they could avoid it so the family would be homeless and jobless. What I thought would be an act of kindness would be the opposite. I don&apos;t know the answer.

 IRS-Slave 

I skipped filing a tax return for a few years in the late 90&apos;s and early 2000&apos;s&apos;The IRS waited nearly 10 years right up until the statutes of limitations nearly ran out before they garnished my wages. I make roughly $25,000 a year. They said I owed $10,000 and took $500 a month for a year equaling $6000 and I switched jobs and lost them for about a year and a quarter. They finally caught up to me and levied my income leaving me about $380 a month to live on and I became homeless at that point. I let them take what they wanted for 6 months which was over $7500 and at that point left me owing them around $2000 or so I thought. I then made payment arrangements of $125 a month and have made all payment on time for more than a year. I had a tax return of over $1000 this past April which they took of course. I called to find out what my balance was thinking that I must have put some kind of dent into my debt and I still owe over $10,000. I have insisted on knowing what I am paying in regards to fines, fees, penalties, and interest. I am accruing $480 a month in interest and $180 in penalties every month. By this time next year I will owe $20,000. I can&apos;t afford to give them more. I am a slave paying for this countries war machine and I have even considered ending my life due to this. I have lost my way regarding my pursuit of happiness. The American dream for me means being born into debt. I own nothing and watch as corporate America gets a free ride. I know I should have exercised more financial responsibility but I thing as a race we spend too much time worrying about what our future will hold and whether we will be able to afford the future. Life isn&apos;t supposed to be so stressful. We should enjoy our lives and our so called freedom.

I&apos;m sorry I am still paying student loans and other debts. But my situation doesn&apos;t really compare. And while we are talking working to live and not the other way around, bottom line is that we still have it much better than they do. Our living conditions are much more habitable than Southeast Asia. We live in much bigger and nicer homes. The laborer probably lives in a small house that&apos;s a fraction in size of ours. We have cars. I&apos;m willing to be these laborers don&apos;t. We have medical insurance available. I&apos;m thinking from this article the laborer doesn&apos;t. We get just about all the food our little bellies can handle and then some! The laborer and his family gets barely just enough. I&apos;m sorry to say but if you are comparing your overall situation to this laborer, even though we ALL accepted the debt on our judgement, then you should probably get down from your high horse and get real.

People of this developed world stop fighting amongst yourselves whether IF there is bonded labor in America with student loans (There is NOT!). If there is tyranny then the people of the world have to unite and help. Anyone in the US can pay this man&apos;s debt. I am severely in debt but I can use my credit card to pay it off and set this man free. Let us do that! Let us ask (if we are not so impudent) that India firstly implements its laws which outlaw bonded labor by cancelling the debt of this man and putting the land lord in prison. Secondly we may ask perhaps (if we are not too forward) that the person who asked for the loans and all the people of India follow a one child policy (as in China) and that they stop over reproduction in that region. That region has the highest birth rate and the most dense populations of any country (1 billion people in India and 1 billion in China alone ?! it doesn&apos;t make sense).

Hey, why so much outrage? We have bondage right here in the United States; it&apos;s called credit card debt. The credit companies stalk college students, and many others, most who have no basic financial management knowledge, bait them into borrowing more than they can repay, then jack the rates up over the years (decades!) once they are hooked. It&apos;s like having a legal pimp on Wall Street. I know, because this has happened to me. I am guessing I have passed the point where I have payed American Express and Visa more than I have borrowed, and I cannot hope to pay off these vultures the debts until I die. And I know half of American is in the same bondage! And to think it was the financial sector who crashed our economy and wants the middle class to fix things. Time for a change, and not the kind the pusillanimous Obama talks about. I mean French style Revolution. Finally, we need some in-depth reporting on modern, capitalist bondage in the US by way of credit card debt.

The wool is over all your eyes as the propaganda has everyone fooled.
Misery is an unnecessary human invention and the rich get away with the greatest crimes.
There is enough resources to sustain life yet the monetary system is set up to fail.

The media is controlled to make you think others have it worse than you so be happy and believe everything they tell you. The poor are often more rich in life than the wealthy as life should be a celebration not an endeavor.

You do not need money only food, water, and shelter but even these things you are enslaved too or poisoned from for instance man made E. coli in Germany, irradiated water etc.

Wake up! NWO wants the world population below 500 million as written in stone in Georgia.

Inflation is the result of interest where more money will always need to be printed to pay back the original loan since the interest never really exists in the monetary supply until more money is printed to pay for it.

Change is the only thing constant.

It took 130 years but America has been hijacked by extremest that for the past 100 years our money is controlled by a Cartel with no Government oversight. If this were not true then the Federal Reserve would be under the Department of Treasury but its not so put it there.

Realize a cruise missile hit the Pentagon and hold everyone responsible that helped cover up 911. You have lost most of you Bill of Rights since then.

They don&apos;t want you to know about money so that they can enslave you to work.

Many students find themselves paying massive amounts each month to the State, barely able to pay bills and provide food for their families, to the Dept of Education. These massive payments usually only go to serve interest on debts that only increase year after year with no end in sight. Despite pleadings with our lovely congressmen, nothing is done. And thanks to Sen. Jeff Sessions sponsored bill in the late 90&apos;s, students&apos;can&apos;t even file for bankruptcy to seek inescapable debt relief from these Gov&apos;t sponsored loans. In effect, it is U.S. Gov&apos;t lifelong inedentured debt servitude to the state. There is also no time limit on these debts.

I see some references to our economy pricing being out of control. Why do you think that the government took us off the gold standard in 1932 and the silver standard in 1959? It was to debase the monitary system of the USA. Today our dollar is a Federal Reserve Note, which is a promissary note of value. Who determines the value? It is the Federal Reserve and the exact people that congress put in charge of our economy! Who is that, the major banks in the USA! So what are they doing, cheaping the dollar through inflation. In other words you save $100 in an account but next year it is only worth $80 in buying value, so the Federal Reserve stole $20 in buying power from you and that my friend is inflation. The only way to correct this problem will be for Congress to eliminate the Federal Reserve, take back what is their job, rebase our money to silver, gold, or other precious metals which remain constant in value and instantly stabilize the nations economy. You are a merchant. Times are rough. You have an item for sale and a person comes to you and has paper from the Federal Reserve and you know it will lose value like a new car when you drive it off the lot, and you have a person that has gold coins that will appreciate as the paper apparently depreciates overnight. Which person are you going to sell the item to? What monitary system are you better off in? Which monitary system are the banks better off in? Why do you think we are in such a pickle today? The banks, insurance companies, wall street, and other major investment firms got to greedy and screwed the pooch. Do they pay for their errors, no we do. Why, becasue Congress is to busy screwing us from their end to pay attention to the people they deligated to do their jobs. Who is at fault here, IT IS US!

What Economic Recovery? Let&apos;s Get Doped Into Foreign Affairs to Forget the Failing Economy.

In May, the American economy added the insignificant number of 38,000 jobs. America is overpopulated with over 311 million people (nobody knows how many illegal aliens) and cannot support its own population, but millions of new illegal and legal immigrants arrive each year. There is no industrial plan to bring back the millions of jobs and industries that global corporations exported and continue to export.
My blog has solutions.

According to the US government&apos;s own statistics, 36% of men 16 to 64 years old are out of the work force. Most don&apos;t count because they are not looking for work. It takes money to look for work, after a while people vanish from the unemployment statistics.

In my blog, I loaded George Washington&apos;s&quot;Farewell Address&quot;advising America. I highlighted the parts that we are violating. Communist China is following this advice and we are committing the folly of ignoring it. My blog contains solutions to our problems that the politicians have failed to implement.

While we drop bombs in Muslim countries financed with debt money, the Communist Chinese announced that they are buying large amounts of European government debt and that they opened a direct railroad linking China with Antwerp, Belgium in Western Europe. Europe is now China’s largest market. Europe is now globalized like America with their global corporations exporting their industrial base to China. Last year China announced that they have a controlling interest in Iraqi oil and are receiving oil from their Iraqi oil fields. The Communists understand capitalism better than we do and that economic power controls governments.

In the USA, only 9% of the economy is industrial. 76% of the jobs created during the&quot;recovery&quot;pay $9 or less per hour with little or no benefits. 47% of American households are too poor to pay income taxes. The Federal Government must beg and borrow $1.65 trillion dollars this year. Many States and local governments are bankrupt. Local Property taxes are crushing the middle class in many States invaded by illegal aliens. Their children consume Medicaid and school services. Bankrupt States like New York have dumped welfare Medicare costs on the counties.

In Europe from Spain to Greece, people are protesting that they have no future because there are no jobs. Europe like America exported its industrial base to China and Third World cheap labor countries. European governments are as deep in debt as America and their economies are failing under globalization.

Obama got us involved into a third Muslim war to get us deeper into the Israeli-Muslim conflict that caused us to inherit Israel&apos;s enemies. The&quot;war of Terror&quot;has cost us in ten years $5 trillion dollars and now a powerful special interest group of war contractors will keep a permanent debt financed war going until we are in debt slavery.

Usury is immoral. It&apos;s not just in Asia. In the US, people go into debt to the banks for life to go to college, and then fall into the debt trap again to buy a home and again to the credit card companies when they need groceries. The rich exploit the other 99% of us. It&apos;s time for the world to wake up. Slavery never ended and it&apos;s not just in the 3rd world.

Yes, those immoral banks forced you into a loan! You needed that money for basic necessities like a computer to browse the internet while you drink coffee on a Saturday afternoon.
I hope you can see the difference between the slavery discussed in this article and moronic&apos;westerners&apos;voluntarily taking out a loan and then spending the money on computers, TVs, a car and a cell phone.

1. Do all of us need to go to College? College has turned into a maturning field of party animals, where kids go to try and learn to be on their own to a degree away from Mom and Dad. Perhaps not all of those that think they need to go to college should be there racking up a debt against themselves. Maybe a local community college trade school is all that is needed where the expense can be controlled.
2. Not all people can afford a home. What happend to the prequalifications? Remember what the Clintons said and the problems it caused? They said everyone regardless of their income can afford a house/home. Guess what, the realistate market is over run with repossessions of homes where people could not afford the home they bought due to the creative marketing and financing to get the people in there to begin with. I won&apos;t even mention NAFTA and the Most Favored Trade Nation Status to China that they did to us.
3. Credit cards are a self control item which should be limited to those that have self control. If you cannot control your spending habits or have to have the latest gadget then you should not have a credit card. Instead use the old saying,&quot;If I canot afford to pay cast for it, then I cannot afford to get it now&quot;Just becasue you pay for it on a credit card does not mean it is free, it must be paid off at a later date at a higher price due to interest being paid on the cash loan you just signed your credit away for.
4. Groceries on a credit card, refer to number 3 answer and also learn how to cook outside the microwave oven. Raw materials cost a lot less than prepared food, are more healthy to eat, and still fill the bill. You can cut your grocery bills down by 2/3 by doing just that one thing. Instead of soda drinks, drink water out of the tap! Do not drink booze or beer and of course stop going out to lunch, dinner, or stopping in in the morning at Starbucks or at McDonalds for Breakfast.

The rich only make money off you when you allow them to. Don&apos;t cooperate and you will save money, lots of it too. Don&apos;t be a slave to your own stupidity and lazyness.

Let me add
1) If you are focused and goal oriented, then go to college. I took out $20k of student loans (in the 90s) and because of my degrees I now make that in a month or two.
2) Don&apos;t hate the rich, try to become one of them. Focus, study and work hard. Think long term.

For the more heartless out there, consider just the basic facts that a person, such as this Indian, may find himself in when he grows up. If the basic cost of living, even a meager one, is higher than the income doing the best full time job that an uneducated peasant can hope to get then that peasant, and every one like him, will be accumulating debt every day of his life with no real way out. The wealthiest in the society are responsible for both the basic cost of living (including servicing deb) as well as setting the wages. Noone is getting handouts, noone is being dumb, and yet the cycle will persist for these poor people. Get off your angry-man republican horses and see things realistically for once.

Look what Washington DC has done to the rest of the USA over the past few decades, nothing good that is for sure. Congress is not doing their jobs, congressmen and senators are getting caught with their pants down, greed, collusion, and incompetance abounds within the hallowed halls that our forefathers served and in many cases gave their lives for.

I see some ridiculous postings here about comparing student loans and mortgages to what these people in Asia have to deal with. Taking out loans to purchase a home or further one&apos;s education is for comfort and profit, not a smatter of survival. One can rent, and one can graduate from high school and seek employment. When&quot;Bonded labor&apos;or indentured servitude as I would prefer to call it, is supported by the international community that is controlled by businesses, what chance do you have? In the US we have high paying jobs that were outsourced to nations that practice the&quot;Bonded labor&quot;approach to reign in profits never realized in a free enterprise system. Pay Day Loans among many other loan sharking outfits, are allowed to reap outrageous profits not seen since the mob was prosecuted by the government.. As long as the government gets their cut from the profits thru taxes, they couldn&apos;t care less about reigning in these operations.If the mafia had only paid taxes, they would be free to operate as they see fit without so much as a second look.

While on this, I disagree with Anurag who says that India has no bonded labour. There is nothing formal as law is against it. But it survives because many people have no other source of help due to their sheer ignorance, no required govt or NGO service. This because while all men and women may be created equal by God, right after birth they become unequal for reasons created by human society-some more so (as in India) than others (as in modern day America).

I dont know how much time did the author (siddharth) spent with the the family of Haresh? I believe that he has heard their story, felt sad for some time and left to US.
Back in US like every other reporter you start making nice story and send it to a news publisher. At the end of the day, mr Haresh and his family is still a bonded labor and the news finally ended here in CNN where some readers feel sad for haresh, some people make fun of India and others discuss completely different topic (student loans and labour in US).

I would have been really happy if the author has put some efforts in protecting Haresh and co from the landlord when he met them, U can complain to the nearby state administration or as a last effort he should have paid at least 50 to 100 dollars to the land lord if u really feel from ur heart that those people are suffering. Donating 100 euros doesn&apos;t bring a great a loss for ur monthly budget.

I definitely feel that we need good reporters and what we read here is a great story, but we should not forget that we are humans and remember human nature of helping others before our profession.

How is this different than what SallieMAE and the private banks do students, in cooperation Congress? I graduated from a very expensive school, only month after 9/11 trashed the economy, and then had a debilitating stroke only a few years latter. The banks have refused to consider any write- off of the loans because Congrees excempted student loans from bankruptcy eligibility, my union has so far refused to enforce the disability settlement provisions of my contract and social security says I don&apos;t qualify because I had&apos;t worked long enough. I hardly think America is in a position to be morally condemning other countries for not protecting their citizens against the predatory practices of.both private and state lend lending institutions. While Bush and Obama were bailing out the banks and the car companies to the tune of trillions of dollars, my mother&apos;20-year marriage was spiraling down the drain because she refused to put me out and to not help to keep my almost grand a in month medial expenses (along with loan pays) paid up. The government made sure that Wall Street could keep their second and third homes and luxury cars, we&apos;re just hanging on with one shared home and autos that are decades old. So much for,&quot;we&apos;re here from the government (or union) and we&apos;re here to help.&quot;

I am from India and familiar with what the article says. The laborers/farmers were poor, uneducated and had no clue what they were signing. If they could not pay the interest every month, the interest got added to the principal. The principal kept getting bigger and soon principal+interest was out of reach of the poor laborer. He became a bonded labor. The goal of the village money lender was not to get back his money. The goal was to trap the poor, uneducated person into becoming a bonded labor and acquire his land and cattle.

To add to the poverty of poor, the ruling class kept increasing the taxes. If you could not pay taxes, they would force the family out of their homes and forcibly take their home and cattle.

Now fast forward to 21st century US. Does the situation above sound familiar? Just because we have added fancy words like negative amortization (look it up on wiki if you are ignorant), default, repossessions, bankruptcy, putting anti-consumer clauses in fine print...doesn&apos;t mean we are smarter. The credit companies do not want you to pay on time, they want interest. The banks do not want your checking account, they want junk fees.

The government (be it federal, state or municipal or township or whatever) keeps increasing taxes. Fail to pay and see what happens.

So do not be under any illusion that bad things happen in India only. In India, if anyone is under such a bad financial situation, the government will come to their help. Can we say the same for US?

Slavery exists for one simple reason: Overpopulation–because there are so many people, and many are born in poverty, most of these people are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty which they are unable to break out of, and because there are so many people, it depresses the wage rate for such people, and they have no option but to put up with their so-called&quot;employers&quot;just to be able to survive and not die of starvation.

Now over-population itself in my opinion is a consequence of the influence of RELIGION. Almost all religions are against
Contraception, Abortion, Homo-sexuality, say that it&apos;s the command of&quot;God&quot;that humans have more and more children. Why? Obviously they are for anything that adds to the population and against anything that doesn&apos;t add to the population. Why would they be interested in an overpopulated world? Because RELIGION is the third pillar along with GOVERNMENT&amp;INDUSTRY that manipulate societies for the benefit of those (at the very top) that run these three outfits, the MILITARY being an arm of all three.

For the very rich and those in power, it doesn&apos;t matter whether the world population is 6 billion or 10 billion, they will always have enough for their families and aren&apos;t really affected by such shifts.
On the contrary, more people for them means
1) a depressed wage rate–ever falling wages–why do you think they like dictatorships where the local populace can be
used as slaves in the factories these people put up? Obviously because it benefits those in power in both these
countries
2) More consumers to buy goods that they produce and want to sell
3) More people meaning, greater the chances that they will turn out to be wayward, less educated, more gullible, and
more ignorant, and can be easily manipulated by their masters to do their bidding without much thought–more
people that can be used as pawns basically.
4) More people–meaning more voters who will mindlessly vote on issues put forth by corrupt parties that do not
address real concerns, given that many are ignorant and easily manipulable
5) More people who can be used as guinea pigs and experimented on by Pharma companies coming out with newer
drugs to sell to the same MORE PEOPLE!

Truly, religion is the opiate of the masses–unplanned procreation aka mindless breeding is the result of a deadly concoction–Beer, BBQ, and Bible.

Dear MoreEnlightenedThanMost, you are one of the few people in this blog discussion who is talking about the real issue. Thank you!

Actually, the question must be asked to, of, and by the so-called kabals,&quot;At what point does the viability of the kabal kill the whole planet?&quot;or do they have that under control already, too?

In college 30 years ago I studied how the populations of the world shot up after the introductions of vaccines far and wide. People who would have died of disease lived and reproduced and their children reproduced also, etc. Everyone wants to live. Everyone, including myself, wants vaccines for himself/herself. But billions in population on the earth are such a strain on the planet. Perhaps wars are lowering the overall population. I need to see the statistics. We all like to think we all hate wars. I hate wars. But, obviously someone must like wars–there are so many. Someone must benefit from them and make money off of them, or pehaps some are using wars to control populations, either blatantly (genocides) or piecemeal. And the kooky terrorists are not exempt from this either, just because they are so very peicemeal in their efforts. They are also about killing off their opponents. Maybe there is something in our species that, when there are too many people, sets humans against each other. I mean, look at some of the pretenses for war. In the big picture, some of them are really stupid (although they are be-all end-all to the ones warring), but the end result is population reduction.

There are efforts of some of the very rich, such as Bill Gates, to immunize and save the lives of even more people around the world.&quot;Every human...right to live a ....life.&quot;- that slogan you hear on NPR for Bill and Melinda Gates. Now, he&apos;s getting a lot of good personal karma for doing this, but, from the perspective of the planet, shouldn&apos;t he give equal amount to the effort of birth control? Maybe he is, but I haven&apos;t heard about it, and I doubt I will because that is such an un-politically correct way to go. From an individual&apos;s karmic perspective, it&apos;s probably bad to interfere with the reproductive karma of others, and yet, who will save us from the overpopulation mess?

Maybe now there is more than one&quot;kabal&quot;: One that wants to maintain the status quo of zillions of uneducated, tv and entertainment-drugged or brutally impoverished slave hordes that support a system that provides supreme, comfort, luxuary, and security for the small percentage at the very top (and to lesser degrees to their lower-tiered puppets) versus one that is breakaway, that realizes that the survival of the human species requires thrwarting the established kabal. Maybe that war is what is raging around us all right now in so many ways.

I would like to hear what other people think about this.

BANKS ONLY GIVE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT, IF THEY DIDNT GET MONEY BANKS THEY WOULD STEAL. IT IS EXPENSIVE TO LEND MONEY, CHARGING 25% INTEREST IS A STEAL FOR THE BORROWER. ALL BANKS LOSE MONEY, EVERYONE KNOWS THIS. OWNING A BANK IS A MODERN DAY CHARITY, BANKS DON&apos;T PAY TAXES BUT THEY ALSO DON&apos;T MAKE A PROFIT.

The slavery for debt custom is much worse in several other states in India which are very poor due to lack of good education, lack of agriculture caused by little rain and lack of industries.

West Bengal for which this article is written is among the richest states in India with much better education, several top-ranked Universities (with more than 95% Bengali employees in a democratic country with around 30 states), industries and agriculture. Bengali people are famous in India for deceitfulness and state-groupism. I have heard that one Bengali first enters employment in another state and when he has power, he starts recruiting only Bengali people; soon they have Bengalis capturing the organization and continue with filthy lifestyle capturing other organizations and grabbing lots of opportunities abroad representing India.

To be precise several other states in India are a little or more like that. People from Maharashtra with a large part of Indian industries and good educational facilities located in Bombay have become famous since past few years for beating and exploiting people from states of Bihar in a democratic country such as India. I also know about a few Indians having really bad time for several years with people from South India that is famous for the computer industry.

If I have authority, I probably would not let people from third-world countries and countries such as China and Saudi Arabia enter developed Western world and spoil its culture and life with filthy way of living. Only external help to that type of countries should be permitted to help them lead better life. Eventually in future, if even one person on Earth sleeps hungry due to poverty, it will not be the world that sacred Gospels speak of.

Birds of the same feather flock together: this is the philosophy Western world must adopt.

I think most of you are not looking at this correctly.

What makes this slavery are the conditions that are needed to even come close to being to pay off the loan.

Here is the reason:

20 years ago US$110 was about equal to 1 year of living expenses in that area.The man took on a debt of about what a lower economic class person in that area would need for 1 year. Think of his debt as about US$ 35,000 for a person in the USA right now.

20 years to pay off US$ 35,000 is actually a reasonable period of time. So it is not the amount of time it is taking to pay off the US$ 110 debt.

It is the conditions that the man and his family need to endure.

The conditions he endures are slavery by any definition.

Let me compare Indian situation and American situation...

He might be poor guy in India and thats how he might have ended up being like that..He does not have option to go anywhere..He is struck and owner might be saying like this is what u owe and stuff..If you have good education you will be alrite ..If your parents,grandparents worked hard and became rich then that guy would have been alrite..depending on ur financial situation and education u have to make steps in ur life..if u make good choices chances are that u will be alrite..u make bad choices then u will have issues especially when parents did not take care.. slave guy he did not have any option or source of income he became like that..

This is a competitive world and u have to make right choices in what type of job u wanna do ..if u make good choices u will be ok ..i came from india to usa..for first few hrs i payed lot of tution..infact international student tution fees is much higher than americans..when i came from india to study my dad gave me loan like 8000 usd thats like may be 1 sem fees and expenses..i had like 3 yrs of masters degree to do...amex,citibank,ATT helped me initially to pay for my college..they gave me when i had no credit..i did computer science degree and jobs are out in usa for computer science that pay decent..now i get like 100k year..i paid of my loans in 1 year after i graduated..bottom line is that u will have tough time..u got to be correct decisions..what u wanna do job in and how much pay it is..u got to work hard..if u work hard and are lucky u can earn money..u got be in right direction..it is all case by and everyones situation is different..u see people who succed in life and learn from then what they are doing ...thats the clue..dont like at people who are struggling..

u have to make smart decisions..

You are right. We do not enslave generations of our families to repay any loans. The conditions and the fact that without the landowner this man has no way to survive are the problem. In the US, even the uneducated laon seeker (25% student loan) wouldn´t enslave his wife, children and their children.

@e2vern–The very first words of the very first sentence say&quot;A bonded laborer named Haresh in West Bengal, India...&quot;. Sounds like India was mentioned to me.

The article then goes on to say that Haresh borrowed money from a&quot;local landowner&quot;in whose fields he and his family are *still* working 20 years later.

Come on, now, @e2verne...do you seriously believe the local landowner packed up Haresh and his entire family and moved them to work in fields outside of India? Or that Haresh was simply on vacation in West Bengal when interviewed?

There are problems with slavery all worldwide. For those that don&apos;t know, there are real slaves in the US as well. What happens to migrant workers coming into Russia is horrible as well.&quot;Wage-slaves&quot;and bondspeople are totally different, with the true horrors they endure. But, the need to survive is just as strong. We in the US grow up and learn that without a college education you could live in poverty and the millions working for minimum wage right now are proof of that. The extreme unemployment in the country makes getting a college education seem like the ONLY way to get a job that will allow you to survive other than packing up and moving to the woods. So, the dedicated ones go through college, graduate, and six months later, when loan payments are expected of you and with no jobs in your field of study available, you not only can&apos;t pay the loans back, but your broke ass has no way to succeed in a money-based society at all. The middle class will disappear soon. I know too many starving graduates who know too many starving graduates for anyone to tell me different.

And I think India or Bangladesh goverment may be the one, a big problem. I guess, they may be having some slaveries in their homes as house keeping or creaning. When they are not paying the amount they supporse to, who esle can change? Long time, we were told or showed about this kind of stories. But nothing changed.

unbelievable. does anyone check facts before typing? the sad truth is that you can never overlay a cultural standard on an incompatible culture. bonded servitude will end in asia when asia (each unique culture in the area) decides to end it. you can piss and moan or send your money and or your army to try and change&quot;things&quot;, but don&apos;t bother trying to change culture. for the&quot;debt slaves&quot;of America - remember this, a college education has no intrinsic value, 0, nada, none. It is only worth what you are willing to pay for it, make damn sure you can recover your investment. There are plenty of unfilled but unglamourous jobs–like plumbers, industrial mechanics, journeyman tool and die makers. You do not need a college education to live well–if you want to show your&quot;crib&quot;on tv and live frivously then I suppose you need some high skill set to do so. But to just live well, you only need a skill and the ability to be mobile (not a mortgage holder). You could also do what I did and honorably serve your country, then your Uncle S will graciously pay for your education. For all of the chicken littles out there, the US would shrink in population if not for immigration, as would most of Europe. India is in real danger of not being able to feed itself in the next decade or less and China&apos;s oft vaunted growth rate is smoke and mirrors that is running into the same constraints in labor, natural resources and finance that everyone else in the world has to live with. America, for all it&apos;s faults, is still the number one immigrant destination in the world (immigrants see no problem with student debt invested well) that has the highest worker productivity from workers that take the least time off and work the most hours, generate the most patents and inventions and somehow manage to lead the world in just about everything that matters. So quit crying about your lives of servitude to the banks and mortgage companies. Go to sleep - you have to work tomorrow!!

Have you ever been debt free since you left high school? Do you not work everyday in order to re-pay that debt?

Are any of you able to just quit work? why not? Because you must pay your mortgage, fix your house, keep the utilities on, pay the taxes and put food on the table.

How different would your life be if you had no debt. Would you still go to work?&quot;

I am out of highschool. I owe no money. I earned a scholarship to college, and worked regardless. Am I able to quit work? For a period of time, sure. For rest of my life? No, but then again, I like being able to buy food and such. Technically speaking, I suppose I could rely on food shelters and such, but I enjoying earning what I have. I split the upkeep on a house with a friend. The house is owned outright and is large enough for both of us, in our mid twenties, to have the space we need. I bought a car when I was 16, a cheap $500 used car. A few years later, I bought a nicer, used SUV for $3500. I knew that vehicle would be dependable. I kept it until I had the money outright to buy a brand new truck with the stuff I wanted on it. I drive that truck now 4 years later still. I have never owed a penny on any of the vehicles. As someone who has no debt, I can honestly say, yes, I will continue going to work. It is worth being able to purchase not just the neccesities but the nice things too. I exchange my time at a career I enjoy in order to buy the things I want. I don&apos;t buy things I don&apos;t have the money for, however.

Do I believe what Siddharth Kara writes, or do I believe that he made up this story about Haresh?

I believe Kara made it up, and I will tell you why. I lived in India for the first 30 years of my life, so I have a pretty good idea was goes on there. Also West Bengal was ruled by the Communist party CPM for 40 years till 2011. When they came to power in the early 1970s, the CPM implemented land reforms where they re-distributed land from the rich landowners to the poor laborers. Over these 40 years, the CPM thoroughly politicized and empowered the laborers, who in term consistently voted them back to power.
So while the story of Haresh makes sensational reading, the likely truth is that it is just a way for Siddharth Kara to get some publicity and continue his professional advancement.

Sounds like he got the A.R.M. instead of the fixed rate.

Why borrow....when he does not have a way to pay back??? He lives there and knows the custom of bondage. He chose put his future family in slavery by borrowing the money.

By the way, folks in the U.S are doing the same thing. Sign a 5-year low rate ARM mortgage and wonder/confuse why it balloons to twice the payment after 5 years. they end up with defaults.

For those who compare the situation in first world countries (not just the USA) remember the two critical differences. This is&apos;multi-generational&apos;and&apos;singular employer&apos;. That is slavery. When your children can be held&apos;in bondage&apos;to your employer to cover your debts to said employer ;while even the combined income of the family is not enough to both cover living costs, reduce the&apos;capital&apos;on the loan, and provide at least enough income to slowly create savings that is slavery. There is no other word for it. It may not (or has been documented may) include physical violence but that is irrelevant the key is the balance (or imbalance in this instance) of power. Your credit card company can take you to court and force you into bankruptcy. They cannot make you work directly for them, and they most certainly cannot come after your family members to cover your debts.

So, can living in the USA in the lower middle income and lower income brackets sometimes feel like a trap you cannot get out of? Or worse a slow downward spiral where you fear your children&apos;s situation may be more dire than your own? Yes. Is it in any way, shape, or form like the debt servitude being discussed here? No, not even close. Of course, that&apos;s just my two cents on the matter.
 June 24, 2011 at 2:58 pm | Reply How to get rid of your student loan!!! 

By accident, I found out how to get rid of my student loan. For decades the government took my tax refund every year against my student loan. Then I went for three years without filing taxes at all (totally legal if the government owes you a refund). Then I filed for the three years all at once (you can file back returns up to three years). The combined refunds due were enough to pay off the student loan IN FULL! However, even though there was enough to pay it in full (plus $1200) they decided to leave $50 outstanding on the loan. I immediately sent them a check for the $50 and am now totally free of the chains that bound me!!! DO NOT TAKE OUT A STUDENT LOAN UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Uh...excuse me??? Don&apos;t be silly. You didn&apos;t find out&quot;by accident&quot;how to pay off your student loans. All that happened was that your last 3 years of refunds were sufficient to finally paid the darned things off once they were garnished.

Had you filed your taxes for those 3 years, the same thing would have happened. The refunds would have been applied to your loans and...gasp...the loans would be paid off.
