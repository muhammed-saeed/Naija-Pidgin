 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 you are writing a resume- and need to ask what some of your duties were? They are: ringing up orders, making change, handing out food, cleaning ( counter area, lobby, bathrooms) stocking ( sauces, fridges/freezers, shake machines, misc. like cups, straws) If you are a drive thru cashier : dishes, table prep, preparing salads, towel buckets.
