 Eat Fast, Eat Healthy With Low Carb Fast Food 
 Eat Fast, Eat Healthy With Low Carb Fast Food 
 Fast Food Statistics 

 Low carb fast food lets people on
low carb diets enjoy eating out without worrying about consuming too many
carbohydrates. Options range from foods that are simply low in carbohydrates to
begin with, to foods that are specially created with small amounts
carbohydrates in mind. 
 One example of low carb fast food comes from Subway. For
years, Subway has marketed itself as a health-oriented fast food restaurant,
and its new low carb wraps continue that trend. In December 2003, Subway
reached a licensing agreement with Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., allowing Subway
to offer Atkins-friendly wraps in stores nationwide. 
 Special wheat and soy grains are used to make the new
low carb wraps, which are high in fiber and protein. There are currently two
low carb wraps at Subway right now, and the number of carbs varies from source
to source. This has a bit more net carbohydrates. There are about 10 net carbs
in the turkey bacon melt, but it’s still low enough to easily fit into your low
carb diet. 
 In addition to the low carb wraps, many of the
nation’s biggest burger joints are getting on the low carb fast food craze with
their own low carb options. Some of the options are new menu items, while
others are modified items already on the menu. 
 One of the best ways to modify menu items is to lose
the unnecessary condiments. Even ketchup, which is relatively high in sugar,
should be minimized or cut out entirely to eliminate those empty carbohydrates. 
 Burger King will also expand its menu with low carb
fast food items aimed at those on the infamous Atkins’and other low carb
diets. One of the more significant changes is the inclusion of meal-sized
salads, which tend to be much lower in carbohydrates and much healthier
altogether than traditional fast food items. 
 Burger King also markets its Whopper as a low carb
option when ordered without the bun, which is something that has become quite
popular. Fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Hardee’s and Carl’s
Jr. offer bunless burgers. Along with modifying existing menu items and
creating new ones, fast food restaurants are beginning to offer more
nutritional information about their foods. Restaurants are also considering
putting some information right on the menus.

 FAST FOOD NO NO&apos;S 
 FAST FOOD NO NO&apos;S 

 Fast Food Statistics 

 We all eat fast food at one time or
another during the month. Some more than others, but most everyone eats fast
food at least once a month. If you don&apos;t eat fast food it has to be a full
blown boycott on it, because the fast food companies make it so convenient to
eat. It seems like everywhere we go fast food chains are offering fresh, hot,
tasty food for the price of a few dollars, or less. It is not easy to stay slim
eating fast food unless you have a movie star metabolism, however it is
possible to limit the damage the food does to you by making smart selections
when you choose to indulge your hunger with fast food. 
 One great way to make smart choices on where to eat,
and what to get, is to do a little homework. You don&apos;t need to be a
nutritionist to discover that one fast food chain has double the sodium in their
French fries then the competition&apos;s French fry sodium levels. You can take the
sodium example, and apply it to calories, cholesterol, and any other ingredient
that you prefer. Most fast food chains offer nutritional charts on their
websites that will help guide you to this pertinent information. 
 If time does not allot for a sit down with the
nutritional menu at your favorite fast food restaurant, then go with this
general rule of thumb: less is more. If you have less food at a fast food
restaurant, you will have more health benefits for it. If you eat larger
quantities of food you will definitely be worse off then if you&apos;d just had half
of what you ordered. 
 Also, take advantage of the new lower calorie choices
which most all of the fast food restaurants are now offering. Most of them have
some form of salad with a lite or reduced calorie salad dressing available. Many
of them also have other choices such as fruit cups or baked potatoes (watch out
for the butter and sour cream) which can be substituted for French fries. 
 Many of the fast food restaurants are now offering
grilled chicken where they only had fried chicken in the past. By choosing
grilled instead of fried, you can still get a fast food sandwich with most of
the trimmings (you may want to leave off the mayonnaise or heavy sauce) and
still stay in the healthy zone. 
 Another idea is to get your sandwich and when it
comes, don&apos;t eat the bread or bun. a really big one is even though the fast
food restaurant advertises and the clerk does his or her best to push you,
don&apos;t &quot;super size&quot; your meal. It may seem like a better value, but in
the long run while you may be paying less money for your food, you are paying a
much greater price with your health. Here&apos;s one more hint which will help you
eat healthier when buying your food at a fast food restaurant. That&apos;s not
eating in your car. Heck, sometimes I eat while I&apos;m driving. Also, it&apos;s hard to
just eat the meat and veggies out of your sandwich and trying to balance a
baked potato is really ridiculous. So what do you do...you know, you opt for
the high calorie, high sodium, high fat meal and eat it as quickly as possible
and hightail it out of there.

 6 Negative Effects Of Eating Fast Food 
 6 Negative Effects Of Eating Fast Food 
 Fast Food Statistics 
1. Fast food has a very high energy density. About 65 percent higher than a typical diet and twice as high as recommended healthy diets which makes us eat more than we otherwise would. Energy density refers to the amount of calories an item of food contains in relation to its weight. Foods with a high energy density confuse the brain&apos;s control systems for appetite, which are based solely on portion size.

2. British researchers from the Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Center and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have determined that repeated eating at McDonald&apos;s or KFC or Burger King, people are more likely to gain weight and become obese. This is because fast food not only contains many more calories than traditional food, but also is more likely to undermine normal appetite control systems.

3. By eating a Big Mac and fries, the body consumes almost twice as many calories as you would if you ate the same weight of pasta and salad. Fast Food restaurants feed the obesity epidemic by getting people to eat many more calories than they need through persistent advertising.

4. McDonald&apos;s, KFC, and Burger King menu items using nutritional data from the fast food restaurants&apos; Web sites, found that when we eat high energy density foods, we don&apos;t reduce the portion size so we get a lot more calories than we need. Our current society possesses a weak innate ability to recognize foods with a high energy density. Food intake is assessed by the size of the portion, yet a fast food meal contains many more calories than a similar sized portion of a healthy meal. The conclusion is we are all being fooled into eating too much food.

5. People get fat eating regular portion sizes, but since the food has a high energy density, people gain weight. In evolutionary terms, the human appetite was designed for low energy density foods. In other parts of the world where these foods are still the dietary staples, obesity is virtually non existent. Our bodies were never designed to cope with the high energy dense foods consumed in the West. That is a major reason why fast food in contributing to the major rise in obesity.

6. Another fact is that fast food may speed up people&apos;s risk of clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks. Researchers at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco have demonstrated that a certain type of fat, called oxidized fat, can accelerate the buildup of plaque in arteries. And many types of fast food such as hamburgers, pizza and French fries are loaded with oxidized fat. The conclusion is fast food meals are high in saturated fat and low quality carbohydrates, white bread and lots of soda. Our bodies require fiber and more healthful types of fats. Fast food represents a dietary pattern that is the opposite of what is recommended for a healthy body.

 Can Fast Food Be Healthy? 
 Can Fast Food Be Healthy? 
 Fast Food Statistics 
It is possible for people to make healthy food choices even if they only have a short time in which to prepare their meals. The first thing to realize is that it is often that healthy choices do not always mean a need for two-hour meals. A person can choose healthy foods that are quick and easy to prepare at home or to pickup from a takeout place. Cities often provide restaurant guides in their telephone books that display full-page menus indicating what a particular restaurant or drive-thru offers. Many of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their usual fast-food selection.

At places like McDonald&apos;s and Hardee&apos;s, it is possible to find consumers who are concerned about their carbohydrate consumption. This has prompted the restaurants to provide other options in their hamburger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered without the bun, for example, and fruit and yogurt are included on the menu along with fresh salads. Many restaurants provide salad choices either as side orders or as complete meals. Often, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or chicken is more attractive than regular menu items. Salads are especially appealing in the summer months because they are lighter on the digestive system.

Restaurants that feature foods in season cultivated by local farmers offer very healthy and affordable choices. Some of these kinds of restaurants will create their own recipes for healthy food options. This provides the consumer with a totally new choice and encourages them to visit the restaurant again.

If home preparation of food is preferred, the options for healthy choices increase. Visiting a local grocery store or supermarket emphasizes the number of healthy choices that are available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more varied than ever before due to improvements in transportation and preservation methods. All types of cuisine can be prepared quickly because of the choices of fresh goods rather than frozen foods. There are numerous choices among frozen foods as well. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased along with demands for more variety in frozen food offerings. Any frozen food aisle in any supermarket will show as many healthy food options and poor choices. The decision is up to the individual.

People can either choose to eat a healthy diet or an unhealthy one. Time and availability of healthy choices are no longer problems for a person who is trying to eat better and healthier foods.

 Fast Food Families: Why You Can’t Afford the Drive Thru 
 Fast Food Families: Why You Can’t Afford the Drive Thru 
 Fast Food Statistics 
It’s a question that makes most moms squirm. What’s for dinner? Unfortunately, many times in desperation the answer is found at the nearest drive thru. Today’s average American eats 4 or more meals away from home each week. Fast food is no longer a treat for many families. It’s a habit that comes with a big price tag not listed on any value menu.

Consider the mom who’s trying to lose weight. She should be eating 1,800 calories or less per day. If she orders a hamburger, small French fries and small soda at the neighborhood drive thru, she’s just spent 1000 calories on lunch. Not to mention the terrible nutritional value of those calories. It’s a very high price to pay for convenience.

Here’s a frightening study. Researchers found that every day, nearly one-third of U.S. children aged 4 to 19 eat fast food, which likely packs on about six extra pounds per child every year. Billions of dollars are spent every year on fast food advertising directed at kids. No wonder America’s kids are wrestling with obesity in alarming numbers.

So what can you do to break the cycle of unhealthy fast food consumption for yourself and your kids before it’s too late?

1. Reduce the number of times you eat fast food. If you currently eat fast food once a week, then make it your goal to go for two weeks before hitting the drive thru again. Over time, wean yourself away from fast food restaurants. Reserve trips to McDonald’s or Burger King for occasional meetings with friends.

2. Find other convenient alternatives for meals. Making sandwiches with sliced turkey breast and whole wheat bread with ready-made salad makes an easy meal that’s more nutritious than any value meal. Buy a rotisserie chicken or other ready-to-eat options at a grocery store instead of choosing fast food. If you dread doing the dishes, why not use paper plates?

3. Watch Super Size Me. You will be astounded by this documentary about the fast food industry. Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock eats only McDonald’s for thirty days straight. You’ll see what happens to his body in just one month. Believe me, you won’t look at a cheeseburger and fries in the same way ever again. This captivating Sundance award-winning feature reveals how we as a nation are eating ourselves to death.

4. Check the nutritional facts on the menu items you order. What fast food place do you frequent most often? What do you usually get? Go online and look for &quot;nutritional facts&quot; on that restaurant’s website. You may be shocked to discover the bacon double cheeseburger you love is a whopping 900 calories. If you have to go to a fast food restaurant to meet a friend or something, do your homework first. Order the least caloric and damaging item on the menu. It’s usually a grilled chicken sandwich, chili, salad with dressing on the side, or a fruit cup.

When your kids ask what’s for dinner, don’t automatically make a beeline for the nearest drive thru. There’s nothing convenient about eating fattyScience Articles, unhealthy food that leads to obesity. Get creative and find better food alternatives for you and your loved ones.

 Fast Food causes Obesity? 
 Fast Food causes Obesity? 
Obesity is a rising anxiety that affects all age groups but it is more seen among individuals who routinely eat fast food . One of the main reasons for the rapid increase in the rate of obesity is fast food. It is just because of unhealthy materials used to increase the taste and attract customers to these food items. They contain high amounts of highly refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, sugars and sodium. They also have very high calorific value and are devoid of all the vital nutrients which play significant roles in the metabolism. High levels of carbohydrates raise the sugar level in the blood, as a result, the liver produce more insulin. High levels of insulin increase the amounts of fat depositions in the body. In this way, fastfood leads to obesity.

Obesity due to fastfood is a major risk factor of ten very serious diseases and health problems. That includes Heart Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Arthritis, Blount’s Disease, Respiratory Problems, Liver Damage and Stroke.
