This place is the best in town imo. Ive had other chinese food in the area and it doesnt even come close to this place. I reccomend the singapore rice noodles, best noodles in town imo.

BEST chicken wings and mambo sauce outside of DC!
 
Their fried chicken wings are addictive: fried hard with a crispy crust, they&apos;re thick and meaty. Much better than the scrawny wings you&apos;ll find at some other carryouts. The combination seafood soup is a meal in itself, loaded with meat and vegetables. A perfect remedy on a cold rainy day. And they&apos;re one of the few Chinese places that still serve shrimp toast. The rest of the menu is the usual carryout fare, with a few odd daily specials. The pepper squid is just that: fried squid, nice and peppery. But their wings are amazing. If you&apos;re in Old Town, they&apos;re right off the GW Parkway. Worth the trip just to get those wings.

Not fancy, just good
 
Magic Wok reminds one of a fast food restaurant. There&apos;s no fancy decor here. Rows of tables sans cloths, plastic utensils, styrofoam plates, no wait staff, self bussing. But the quality of the food is much better than the usual Chinese carry-out. Spring rolls are light and crispy and the dumplings are quite tasty. The selection of soups is impressive and has more depth than a typical carry-out. They prepare just about all of the fare that other Chinese restaurants offer and then some. They do have a couple of duck dishes which are good and the seafood selection is fairly extensive as well. Prices are very reasonable. You&apos;d be hard pressed to find more bang for your buck than Magic Wok.

A Cut Above
 
Magic Wok is a cut above other typical Chinese carryouts. While they actually have in store seating, it is cafeteria style, not a true restaurant. That being said, their food is better than most of this type. Their flavorings aren&apos;t quite so Americanized. The dishes have a little more snap, a bit more depth to them. They make familiar appetizers better. Try the spareribs: more tender than most Chinese carryouts. The&quot;chicken on a stick&quot;is tender and flavorful. The soups have more flavor and more body to them. While the typical entrees are good, the house specialties are excellent. Salt and Pepper Shrimp is crisp, but not fried to death. Combination Pan-Fried Noodles are a favorite at our house, So, like any Chinese carryout that delivers, Magic Wok can be hit or miss. But in general, they are a cut above the rest,
