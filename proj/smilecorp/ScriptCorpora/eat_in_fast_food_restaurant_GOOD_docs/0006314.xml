LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Posted: Mar. 8, 2012 | 6:52 p.m. 
Henderson police asked for the public&apos;s help in identifying an armed robber who hit a fast food restaurant last week.

The man robbed the Subway, 2620 N. Green Valley Parkway, near Sunset Road on March 2. He entered the restaurant about 2 p.m. and sat down at a table to drink a soda. After almost an hour, he walked to the cash register to buy a bag of potato chips, police said.

When the clerk opened the register, the man pulled a handgun, grabbed the cash and ran, police said.

The robber was a Hispanic man, about 20 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall and between 150 to 170 pounds. He was wearing blue jeans, a black jacket, a blue bandana on his neck and a black baseball cap.

Anyone with information can call Henderson police at 267-4750 or leave anonymous tips with Crime Stoppers at 385-5555 or www.crimestoppersofnv.com . Tipsters who contact Crime Stoppers could be eligible for a cash reward.

Contact reporter Brian Haynes at bhaynes@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0281.

The scarf on his neck is probably hiding one of those attractive neck tattoos.

Maybe he&apos;ll get a good Henderson beating and a kick in the head.

I think Henderson police will catch this robber very soon. He was sitting on table about 1 hour, drinking soda. He probably did not know video camera is in every store. He probably does not know what is fingerprint. Table, soda container, he was drinking. all sort of evidence he left. You don&apos;t see this kind of stupid robber anywhere.
