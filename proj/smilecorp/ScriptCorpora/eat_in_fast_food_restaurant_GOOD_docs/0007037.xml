 July 12, 2012 Gelati Celesti Ice Cream Makers Beware: It&apos;s heavy but delicious! by True Food_Junkie ( 50 reviews ) What makes regular ice cream light and fluffy is the amount of air they put into the ice cream making process. This place puts very little air in their ice cream (like a gelato) which makes it very thick. You can definitely feel it when you try to eat it with a spoon. We went here after dinner, my husband and I had a hard time finishing our small almond amaretto and White Chocolate Peanut Butter (absolutely delicious). This ice cream is a lot richer than DQ and Baskin Robbins, so just be aware of that when you are choosing your size. The people here are friendly and generous when packing on the scoops and the place offers several chair and tables inside and outside to enjoy your frozen treat. They even have a water crock stand with disposable cups to help you quench your thirst afterwards. I will definitely be coming back to try out more flavors! June 13, 2012 Wing Command Don&apos;t Waste Your Time! by Greg ( 3 reviews ) Tonight I visited the restaurant, 6/12/12, I did this because I was in the mood for wings and Buffalo Wild Wings down the street had a 30 minute wait for a table. I arrived at 6:40pm to a basically empty restaurant. When I entered the restaurant I was greeted by my waitress (rochelle or raquel) who promptly seated me. The table I was seated at wobbled terribly, but I could deal with it. The music playing was some repetitive techno something that the waitress easily changed at my request, she was very helpful and promptly took my order. According to my receipt she entered the order to the kitchen at 6:52 and then I waited for my order...... and waited.... and waited.... and waited.... 34 minutes for 12 boneless wings and fries to be delivered. This was absurd as there was only 3 other tables or approx. 15 other people in the restaurant at the time. Yes a 34 minute wait in a basically empty restaurant. The chicken was good... the sauce was terrible...

This was absurd as there was only 3 other tables or approx. 15 other people in the restaurant at the time. Yes a 34 minute wait in a basically empty restaurant. The chicken was good... the sauce was terrible... I tasted vinegar and something with heat, not the Chipotle I was expecting. Yes, I know that chipotle is a smoked jalapeno and what it tastes like being from the southwest. Oh yea, there was so much sauce on the chicken that I needed to remove the chicken from the pool of sauce in the delivery dish. The fries i received were warm and bendy, not hot and crisp and had so much salt on them that my blood pressure rose 100 points at the first bite. NASTY! Lastly it was supposed to be $.50 boneless wing night, however my 12 boneless wings cost $8.75, not the $6 I was expecting... why is that when the website and facebook page both advertise the lower price? Now you may think I&apos;m just some jerk, however I believe the details above show an honest review of my experience at the business and a basically empty restaurant. June 11, 2012 Firehouse Subs Best Subs In Richmond by Bridgett Jacobs ( 2 reviews ) all of it! -
My husband I love their Subs. The meat is steam heated and not stuck in a freaking nasty microwave like at other joints. The sandwiches are so delicious and their soda machine allows you have over 100 different soda combos. The one thing we didn&apos;t enjoy was their Chili but we have had all their subs and really enjoyed them. Their service has always been good and they seem to keep really busy. Also, you can donate to a Fire Fighter Fund with each purchase, pretty awesome! Sure the menu is limited but like most places, when its limited it means they do one thing really well and not 40 things sub par!
