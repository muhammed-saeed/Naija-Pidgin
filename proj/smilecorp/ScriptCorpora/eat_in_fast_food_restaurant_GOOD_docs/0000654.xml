		Introducing, NEW Potty Mitts!! Worry no more about taking your toddler into the bathroom at the mall or a fast food restaurant! Potty Mitts are a new approach to protecting your child from germs in public bathrooms because kids touch everything! Place disposable Potty Mitts on your child and their hands are protected no matter what they touch (toilet

through! Each mitt is decorated with playful bears so kids love to wear them! Potty Mitts come in a convenient collapsible pouch for easy storage in purse or pocket. Potty Mitts are a &quot;must-have&quot; for families on-the-go!
