Restaurants and traditional food joints has been an age old concept with the dominance of a large number of unorganized players operating as street vendors, roadside eateries and stand-alone restaurants. However, with growing urbanization and changing lifestyles, the organized players have occupied a firm foot hold in this market which is worth INR 580 bn and shows huge potential for growth in future.

The report begins with the market overview section providing the size of the restaurant or the food service market in India with a brief description of the various segments that exist in the market and the penetration of the organized players in the various segments.
An analysis of the drivers explain the factors for growth of the industry including growing disposable income, favourable demographics, changing lifestyles and preferences, increasing proportion of take away food and increasing number of working women. The key challenges identified encompass cumbersome licensing, food price fluctuations, high cost of real estate and lack of skilled manpower. Key trends have also been analyzed including foreign players foraying into the Indian market, brand expansion into smaller cities, Indian brands exploring the foreign market, growth in food franchising and emergence of theme-based cafes and restaurants.
The competition section provides an overview of the competitive landscape in the industry illustrating the share of organized and unorganized players and the entry route for the foreign players into the Indian market.
