 McDonald’s Perception Change

 Last year, I personally interviewed several thousand fast food customers (in-store and drive-thru) in a variety of fast food brands for Trade Area Research purposes. (Do you need trade research before expanding your market?) This was normal for me as I have  personally interviewed thousands of fast food customers for dozens of years . And, as you might know, certain questions are nearly standard on questionnaires trying to understand customer behaviour - such as the fast food restaurant that the customer uses `most often’. 

 In the 1980’s and even into the late 1990’s - when adults answered that question for me—when the answer was McDonald’s - they would immediately offer a `reason’, in an apologetic tone, which invariably was `the kids’. That is not to say that I didn’t hear `they are everywhere’and `they are cheap’on occasion. Nevertheless, the interesting thing was that `other brands’such as Wendy’s or Arby’s or Chick-Fil-A  or others (such as sandwich chains Subway) - most often users ALMOST NEVER offered up `embarrassing’reasons for their usage of a particular brand most. Only McDonald’s. It was almost a case of doing `marketing’too well. 

 Then, McDonald’s focused less on kids and more on product and product quality. I began to hear folks say that they liked a `particular new product’at McDonald’s that they went for `most often’. Kids, as a reason, was definitely fading quickly (I informed my clients who at first seemed surprised in the early 2000’s —it was the kind of information that only came from literally being on the ground for multiple brands for decades) - the return of McDonald’s was approaching. 

 The moral - If the biggest can change a negative perception—other brands, most of which have neutral images , can also build a positive one - like McDonald’s has done.

 Sales Dollars By Customer Frequency Level

 Hello restaurant owners, and welcome back to Restaurant Trade Area Research - where I share over 30 years of insights from doing restaurant research - and, link to the latest of interest in the restaurant universe. Today I want to share with you the actual findings in a 3 store market about a decade ago. 

 While I won’t go into the extreme measures that need to be employed to have a VALID sample to begin with at a fast food restaurant (but you can find out more at my other information site www.squidoo.com/tradeareasurveys ) - here are the results I want you to consider. 

 3 stores - $2,670,000 Sales (rounded) 

 customers that come 4+ times wk - 3% of trans - 80,000 in sales 

 2 or 3 times a week - 13% of trans - 348,000 sales 

 Once a week - 24% of trans - 642,000 in sales 

 Once every 2-3 weeks - 24% of trans - 642,000 in sales 

 Once a month - 12% of trans - 321,000 in sales 

 Once every 2or3 months - 9% of trans - 241,000 in sales 

 Once every 4to6 months - 1% of trans - 26,000 in sales 

 Less than every 6 months - 7% of trans - 187,000 in sales 

 First time users - 7% of trans - 187,000 in sales 

 You would be surprised how many owners DON’T think of their real customer base in this manner - what levels ACTUALLY provide the real dollars to a store. This weekend in this blog - I will expand on the data above. But, now, to today’s restaurant links - feel free to comment too.
