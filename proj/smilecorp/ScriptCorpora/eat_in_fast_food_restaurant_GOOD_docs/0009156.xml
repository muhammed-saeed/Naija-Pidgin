Frizzle&apos;s offers new spin on fast-food restaurant

Published: Thursday, June 12, 2008, 8:38 AM   Updated: Thursday, June 12, 2008, 9:07 AM 
 By Mike Kaylor The Huntsville Times 
 Follow 7 Tweet Share close Digg Stumble Upon Fark Reddit Share Email Print Bryan Bacon / Huntsville Times Chicken fingers with a light, crisp breading are a specialty at Frizzle&apos;s. Think fast food, and the national names come to mind: McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Long John Silver&apos;s, for example. Now folks can add a local name to the list.
Frizzle&apos;s is not a chain. It&apos;s a locally conceived restaurant specializing in fresh tenders and frozen custard.

Yet, it has the polished look, the slick style and lively atmosphere of a major brand. Although it boasts of its fresh tenders, customers can find much more. Wings, catfish, burgers, hot dogs and fries are equally as prominent.


The founder of Frizzle&apos;s owns local franchises for Dairy Queen. That explains the similarities, but this is by no means a clone of the long-established ice cream concept.

Frozen custard is a relatively new phenomenon for the South. It is similar to ice cream, only made with eggs and processed to a creamier texture. Frizzle&apos;s makes three or more flavors fresh each day and uses it in sundaes, cones, shakes and other specialty drinks.

Chicken tenders and catfish fillets are delicately battered and cooked to a nice crispness. They&apos;re neither dry nor oily. Prices range from a four-piece chicken snack for $4.99 to a six-piece catfish combination with two sides for $7.19. The fish dinners are called &quot;Fish &apos;n&apos; Grits&quot; because traditional Southern grits is one of the restaurant&apos;s side dishes.

The other sides include coleslaw, corn on the cob, fries, chili-cheese fries, onion rings and baked beans. That chili on the fries is the same served on hot dogs - meaty and mildly spicy.

The custard treats are affordable desserts for those with big enough appetites but also worth a special trip on a hot afternoon. Premium sundaes include a banana split, strawberry shortcake and hot fudge cake. The restaurant also makes custard latte in flavors such as French vanilla, mocca, caramel and cappuccino. Cones or cups start at $1.49; sundaes range from $1.99 to $2.59; and shakes cost $2.99 and $3.39.

Ricky Glover and his daughter, Cassidy, conceived the idea of Frizzle&apos;s after she earned her business degree from the University of North Alabama. He has been running Sonic and then Dairy Queen restaurants for more than two decades, so they decided to try their own concept. Frizzle&apos;s was built on Jordan Lane where a Krystal stood for many years. If this one is successful, the owners have a greater vision. The tenders, fish and onion rings use their own special breading, and the mildly tart chicken sauce is also a special recipe. Both are very good.

Frizzle&apos;s just might spread across North Alabama. Maybe even farther.

 DINNER TALK 

 What would you order if you came back to this restaurant? 
 
From left:

Kirk Greising - &quot;I would order the catfish, because it wasn&apos;t that fishy tasting with a slushy and dessert.&quot;

Brent Greising - &quot;I would order wings. I would also order strawberry ice cream.&quot;

Rose Greising - &quot;If I come back, I would order the catfish and latte. The help seemed happy to help out and serve. I like the wings and chili fries, and the custard latte was good.&quot;

Jean Greising - &quot;When I come back, I would order chicken tenders. I tasted them, and they were crispy and not too much breading. I would also try the special custard of the day. Nothing was too heavily breaded. Very good frozen custard.&quot;

Amelia Greising - &quot;I would order the tenders again. They were good quality and the breading was amazing. The service was pretty good; they were fast and friendly.&quot;
