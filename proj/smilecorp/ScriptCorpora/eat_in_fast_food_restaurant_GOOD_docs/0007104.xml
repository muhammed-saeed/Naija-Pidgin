Burger King Complaint

 


Jim Hyatt

Executive Vice President

U.S. Franchise Operations&amp;Global Operations Officer

Burger King Corporate Office

5505 Blue Lagoon Drive

Miami, FL 33126 June 27, 2005 Dear Jim Hyatt, Subject: Health Policies at BK #122599 I am writing in regards to the Burger King at Seattle-Tacoma Airport in Seattle, Washington. My husband and I were in the airport yesterday afternoon and stopped to purchase lunch before our flight. We ordered a large Chicken Whopper value meal and a Whopper sandwich. I took the sandwiches out of the bag at our table and noticed that we had received medium fries, not large. We took the fries back to the counter and asked for large fries. The employee took the fries from us, RETURNED THE FRIES TO THE BIN of cooked and salted fries and reallocated fries out of the bin into a large fry container. Meaning some of the fries we received in the large order were from the original medium order, but some of the medium order would be redistributed to other customers. I do NOT believe that this is proper and cannot believe that such a policy would pass any health codes. If the employee had simply given us some additional fries so that we would have the equivalent of a large fry, I feel that would have been appropriate. If the employee had taken the fries that we returned, discarded them and given us a new set of large fries, I believe that would have been the better policy. However, the employee returned the fries to the fry salting area! What if we had tampered with the fries? What if we were sick? What if anything else happened? We did not tamper with the fries and are not sick, but the fries SHOULD NOT have been returned to the bin. This is a health hazard and puts customers at risk. Also, the returned fries would have been from a slightly older batch of fries and not as fresh. I would like to know what your operation policies are and how this could happen. I do not know whether this location is a franchise or a company owned store; however, the same policies and training should be instilled and enforced at all locations. Please respond. Sincerely, XXXXX XXXXX cc: Dave Gagnon, Senior Vice President, North American Company Operations

This is as low as you can go, I hate BK. They serve NO MEAT on their whopper jr&apos;s at all. Places in Hagerstown, Md are greasy floor&apos;s and really dirty, why would anyone even want to eat their, as far as their new fries, what a JOKE, someone gave me a couple, McDonald&apos;s still have them beat by a long shot, they just need to close their doors, Wendy&apos;s is rising fast, GO Wendy&apos;s.

I&apos;m an employee at a Burger King under Bill Thompson&apos;s ownership in Northeast Florida and have been for nine months. Yesterday, I was getting ready for work in the morning and realized that I was very nauseous. I called my General Manager and told her that I was highly nauseous and was not sure if I was going to be able to be around food without vomiting. I took some Tylenol and went to work. When I got there, and the smell of food hit me, I realized that I was more nauseous than I originally thought. I told my GM and the hourly manager again that I still thought that I was not going to be able to be around the food, so they put me in the hole. A member of the kitchen crew was cutting onions and my nausea got even worse. About an hour of working, I told the hourly manager that I was not sure how much longer I could take all the smells. Five minutes later, I told her over the headset that I had to vomit and I walked very fast to the bathroom. When I came out, the hourly manager told me that they had called for somebody else to come in and cover for me and she would be there in ten minutes. A few minutes later, my GM told me to just go home and they would cover until my relief got there. So I went home to rest. I assumed that they were going to leave a note for the manager tomorrow morning that I probably was not going to be in, since I had thrown up at the store. I woke up this morning to the same hourly manager asking why I was not at the store for my shift and I told her it was because I was still sick. She started complaining about how I should have called and that if I was going to be out for another day that I had to go see a doctor and get a note. I told her I would have to then. So, I had to drive from Green Cove Springs to NAS Jax to sit in the ER for 3 hours to get the note stating that I had the flu and would have to stay home and rest for today and tomorrow. When I got home, my father went to the Burger King that I work at. When my father went in to the store, the hourly manager told my father that I had never told her yesterday that I had vomited and that they never sent me home early. I was appalled that my manager actually lied to my father&apos;s face. I called my GM and told her about what the hourly manager had told my father. She was not there when my father was at the store, but she insisted that the hourly manager never said any of those things to my father. She basically told me that my father, who NEVER lies and has no reason to, had lied to me, without using those exact words. She just kept telling me the hourly manager had never said those things. I am highly appalled at the fact that one of Bill Thompson&apos;s managers found it appropriate to lie to my father and that another tried to tell me that my father was the liar. This is not the first time that this same hourly manager has required me to work my shift while being ill. I would highly appreciate that someone look into this. If nothing is accomplished, I will personally take this to corporate or higher up to the CEO.

It is June 18, 2011. Around 6 pm, my husband and I decided to have Burger King in Holmen Wisconsin. Upon pulling up to, the drive thru a male started to take our order. As my husband was trying to order#4, whopper jar. Value meal, with no pickle or onions this male, Cal something, interrupted my husband while still in the process of ordering. Cal very rudely stated small, medium, or large and what do you want to drink. My husband nicely asked him to please let him finish his order. Cal became even ruder with his tone of voice and told my husband that he did not interrupt. My husband told him to cancel the order. As we drove by the window, one person gave us the middle finger. Upon this action, we drove around the building to get the personâs name, Cal something, and the manager&apos;s number. I entered to building to find the crew laughing it up until they noticed me standing there. I asked him to write down his name and the general managerâs name. He was even ruder upon this request and ran to the back of the kitchen, retrieved the phone, and made a few phone calls before coming back out. As he is on the phone leaving a message for the general manager, Jesse Hess. He refused to write his own information down. We have tried calling Jesse several times and he has refused to return our calls. We have had a previous encounter with this store but put it off to being a busy time of the day. Today, however the establishment was completely empty of customers, also no one was behind us or before us in the drive thru. He had no reason to be so rude and unprofessional. As I was leaving the store I told him he would be hearing from us and he stated that&amp;quoting highly doubt It.&amp;quot; As a manager myself, this behavior would not be tolerated in any manner. Customer service is the key to any company, without it, you have no customers and no business.

on wednesday.11th May,2011.i visited the Burger King Restaurant located at shevchenko and Newmaan Blvd in Ville La Salle,Montreal,Quebec,Canada.first of all someone who seemed to be the manager of the day,by the name of ISHA,rudely advised me and other customers that we were standing at the wrong part of the line and,THAT,WE SHOULD BE STANDING THERE AND NOT HERE....gesticulating with her FINGER,she also seemed to have been training one of the cashiers.as she was showing off herself by walking round and round the restaurant in the area of the cashiers..before me,someone was served a wrong item and she looked on as if the customer had no right to complain..when it came to my turn..i went to the drink fountains and realized that there was no ICE.i politely advised her and she said that someone would be there to put the ICE...in the meantime,she is joking around with the employees..i got my order and again returned to the fountain and still there was no ICE,while all the employees continued to have a CONFERENCE...I then asked for some ketchup and she pointed rudely again,that it is OVER THERE....!!!one of the male cashiers were also all over her..then,she decided to have her lunch...and decided to sit right behind me,knocking my seat all the while with her feet..when i left the restaurant,they were still having their little conferences.hope that this matter is urgently addressed,then,i do not know if they were careful in their preparation of the food-i actually orded a Whopper trio,when i got home,i had to go to the washroom urgently.

thank you.

Mr Hyatt,

I have done lunch a couple times in the Spring of 2011 at your Mt Laurel NJ and the people are polite and working hard but they are dramatically understaffed. Each visit found the woman who works the front counter at lunch on weekdays trying to juggle the tasks of bagging and preparing foods as well as order-taking and ringing. Yesterday I was in there and at arrival, was 4th in line of people who were ordering normal sized meals. The next 30 minutes were spent watching this woman try and get orders fulfilled with limited effectiveness. I stayed to see how it panned out more than to enjoy my meal. Two guests who got in line behind me and one in front of me gave up and left without placing an order. the whole event took over an hour. I don&apos;t know if it is normal for one person to work the front-counter at lunch but it appears that this person cannot.


Previous visits were comparable in timeframe and shade my decision whether or not I want a Burger King lunch when in Mt Laurel NJ.

Gentlemen last wk i spent $24 I have been spending $12 and change as a regular basis. last wk for the first time in a long time the food was not cooked to order the fries were like rubber and burgers were pre maid, I had asked for the single double and they no longer had it i asked for the next dollar double as it turned out the manager said their was only the new double with bacon for $2,he could not answer any of my questions about the new burgers, I came in to the store acouple days later, as i usually use ther drive up, to tell the manager about the bad food, he would not answer me and kept talking to other people ,I asked for the no. of the corp office he would not give it to me I told him he was a terible manager, he only made faces at me , i started to yell at him to do someting, he did not, a nice counter helper said i&quot;ll make the food for you, that is how it ended , the manager both times i believe was the same manager for your knowledge.

To Whom It May Concern:


I am writing to complain about two of your stores. The Finneytown store on Winton Road at Hempstead and the Avondale store on Reading at Forest.


The employees including the Managers are GHETTO and unprofessional. Their uniforms are dirty and the place is unsanitary. It is not unusual to sit in the drive through for 20 minutes waiting on to place an order of get your food. Burger King is the only hamburger I like to eat. It&apos;s unfortunate that I have to drive 5 miles to another location to get decent service. These locations need to shut down!! Or you need to get some decent employees. I will wage a personal campaign and let all of my friends and family know to BOYCOTT BURGER KING.


I work as a workforce development trainer and these locations gives me plenty of stories to share with my clients about how NOT to present yourself to the public.


My next step is to contact our local I-TEAM to do a report on bad service. Maybe I should take my video camera and share the information with the local news agencies.

I live in Winston-Salem, NC and I cannot believe that last month I went to Burger King on Martin Luther King Drive and I wanted a whopper and they did not have any lettuce, tomatoes, onions or pickles. That is crazy and then I went the other night and they did not have any whoppers at all. They told us that they are waiting on the truck to come in with supplies. What is going on that is really bad business and some of us plan or not patronizing the store. What is going on? The main thing is whoppers.

11-24-2010. Burger King store id #


I AM FORCED TO VISIT THIS STORE OUT OF NECESSITY DUE TO PROXIMITY TO WORK. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. This is the worst fast food restaurant I have been to. The line is always out the door and the drive thru is just as bad (they process one order at a time from start to finish....how can a fast food restaurant operate like that?) . Tonite was the last chance they had to redeem themselves and they failed horribly. After waiting 15 minutes in the drive thru as the fourth car in line, no took the first cars order in line, the two cars in front of me left and I decided to go inside to complain(I asked the first driver he long he was there and he said 20 minutes). When i got inside no one was at the counter in line and the manager was walking around doing nothing to help the drive thru girl. Instead of an apology, the obnoxious manager women behind started to argue with me telling me I was out of line. THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRITE. EVIDENTLY NO ONE TAUGHT THIS TO THIS WOMAN IN HER 5 MINUTE MANAGER CLASS. I went outside and left the drive thru and when I went around the pick up window there was one car. And the max number of cars between the order screen and the window is 3. WTF!!!!!!

After leaving with no food. I called to ask her name and inform her I was going to report the store and her to her superior. She proceeded to yell, gave me no information and hung up the phone on me.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!

The wife and I took two of our grandkids to Burger King last Sunday at the Beechmont and Berney Ln. store in Cincinnati, Ohio. First of all the white boy with long black dirty looking hair took our order and used the cash regester and went straight from there to work on the food without any gloves on. Later his tall black boyfriend came in to take him home and they met with a lips to lips kiss there in the front room.

My five year old twin grand kids did not need to see that and if it were not for laws I would of kicked both of their skinny asses right there and then.

The lady manager was there and didn&apos;t say or do anything to correct this sick action. We have decided to tell everyone we know in this area of what we saw and we will never go back in our life time.


If the law says you have to hire these sick bastards then you should have the right to make them act normal on Burger King property.

My complaint is on store # 00165 in greensboro, N.c. on Summit Ave. We went into the store 2 people were in front of us and 2 behind us there were 5 employees,a shift manager and the store manager Rebecca. We all stood there 5 minutes with no service. Rebecca did not look up or ask anyone to wait on the customers, she just totally iginore everyone, even when I said CUSTOMERS COME FIRST SHE DIDN&apos;T BULGE!!! It was so unprofessional, I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.. THE PEOPLE THAT GIVE YOU YOUR JOBS AND KEEP YOU IN BUSINESS, GETTING TOTALLY IGNORED. My dad ordered a salad with grilled chix and got whopper patties(who trained these people?) I worked for BK and McD&apos;s before and I know this is not acceptable. The crew we had at BK waited on customers as soon as we seen them. This is not the only time this has happen at this BK., it has happen nunerous times and many times we just walk out. It&apos;s so simple and just plain common sense. I NEVER GO TO A BK AGAIN AND WILL TELL OTHER NOT TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!

My name is Jeff Davis and have a comment about another location doing nearly the same thing as this complaint explained. It was September 19th 2010

at around 5 p.m or so in Pensacola Florida located on michigan avenue right by mobile highway. Me and my wife went through the drive thru and ordered 4 buck doubles. We got home which is only about 3 minutes away or so and proceeded to eat. Upon opening the wrappers we noticed these burgers were significantly cold, not even lukewarm. So i actually broke a piece of a burger patty in half to stick my finger in the middle,still cold all the way thru.I took my time and actually stuck a thermometer in the meat...what do i get, 75.3 Degrees!!!!! now im not up to date on the temperature requirements but when i worked as a teenager at whataburger i thought it was more around 120 degrees.so we took our burgers back (shall i mention we have a salmonella break out right now and my wife is pregnant, add that with cold meat!) when we took the burgers back the front desk emloyee took them and told the manager that she wa throwing them away, the manager asked why. the employee said they brought them back cause theyre cold. the manager then said NO, i mean why are you throwing them away...my wife openely muttered, well i hope your throwing them away considering ive had my hands all on the burgers and my husband actually stuck his finger in one AND theyre old and cold.....and the front desk employeee literally counted to 3 before throwing them away which made me assume the manager normally keeps brought back food and at that time she got angry at the employee for throwing these burgers away. Thats quite disgusting if you ask me plus what if we had put some poison or anthrax in those burgers and brought them back and the manager resold them.think its crasy its happened before (not with burgers but remember tylenol poision?) and this is not the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th or 5th time we have had problems at this location,weve called complaints in atleast 5 times....the workers are rude,slow,the food is cold and disgusting,and the workers walk around cussing and acting like fools.

im not racist but i think its funny i go in the mornings (white people working) my food is fine,i go in the evening (blacks working) and my food including the service is piss fucking poor.

Im not commentin on the article prior to this,just wanting to make people aware of a few things

--

Hello

to whom it may concern-

I have a complaint about one of your managers-currently works at the stoe in wayne county on wayne memorial,in North Carolina.

his name is Jason Wright-he is sexually harrassing female employes.

I used to work at the store on Berkley when he used to work there

he actually asked me if I would give him a blow job and offerd me $600 of I could do it with in 15 minutes.

well reguardless to say I no longer work there and he is one of the reasons I no longer work there-I was nice and did not press charges all though I should have-but the store manager knew of this Ms Danette (pardonme is if I spelled her name wrong) as well as the district manager knew about this and neither believed me or they just did not feel like doing anything about the problem.

well I as well found out recently he used to work at the burger king/gas station in marmac-

he got transfered from there to berkley (this was before I knew him) because of sexuall harrassment-he got transfered from berkley to marmac (same reason) then from marmac to wayne memorial ( same reason)

why do they keep transferring him and trying to hide it instead of just firing him?!?!

I also found out he is really good friends with the district manager..

 

I have a friend that just started working at burger king ( I did not know she was working there) but talking to her on the phone and what not she was complaining about how this person was sexually harrasing her-I said she needed to report it-she was scared to report it cause she did not want to loose her job cause hse has to support her baby and her husband had just lost his job -well I asked her where she was working at-she then told me burger king-I asked her by chance is the guys nake Jason Wright?

she said yes!

she said that he was doing this to all the ladies that work there particulary the ones that happen to be white.

this man has to be stopped! I do not mean a slap on the hand either he needs to be fired.

I have been talking to the other ladies he ahs been doing this to,

I know I let to much time go by to do much of anything now which is my bad-

but these girls are even talking about going as far as taking it to the local news one if them said she went to school with one of the local broadcaster.

I said that I would e mail you guys-cause this needs to be fixed-she said if it is not delt with immediatly as possible then she is going to take this to the news.

and embarasse the crap out of burger king in this area for not doing a thing about it.

this other girl Jason has gone as far as message her on yahoo and has no clue how he got her yahoo id (she thinks may have been from the job application) but started to harrassing her on yahoo messenger-Jason Wright has done this to me as well and YES!! I have saved the recent conversations of this! so now I have proof!!!

there are a few other thing that went on at the Berkly burger king-like the night shift during the time I was working there all but 3 people were taking drugs- and going to work high as a kite one of them was always drunk- 2 others would light up marjuana (joints) while on the clock in the back room-and yes ms daenette knew about this as well as the managers working on there shifts and nothing was ever done about it.when one particualr manager was working I think her name is Keontay-she was one of the managers that knew of this.but she as well was afraid of loosing her job.

 

SOMETHING has to be done before more damage is done.

I love burger king it is my favorite fast food place- I can not believe that this was allowed to go on.

I will be watching in hope that your coporation cares enought to do something before the girl I mentioned takes this to the media -and the other girl takes this to court.

 

fix this problem please and thankyou

I was just at BK #4732 on 950 w. alameda ave. denver co 80223. Sale #19190848. I was the only one in the drive thru and it appeared there was no one inside. My burgers were cold and my chicken fries were over done until they were inedible and that was all I got. Thought I&apos;d let you know. Won&apos;t be back anytime soon.

yeah, It&apos;s 8/11/2010.. I just got back from Burger King in Springfield IL 2900 South 6th Street, Springfield - (217) 527-8130,


First I was greeted at the drive through by the rudest woman i have ever met. She yelled at me because I order a drink you guys didn&apos;t have. My mistake yes but yelling at me? I pulled up to the drive thru and she continued to be rude and openly. Keep in mind this is the first time I have returned to this Burger King in a year. I stopped once before for almost the same reasons but I didn&apos;t report it. This time I have had it!!


I get home unwrap my food and guess what? Smoked Steak XT cheddar has no cheddar, or any thing else but mayo and a little bit of lettuce. The chicken sandwich my girlfriend ordered had no cheese or anything as well. But thats not all people, It gets better. The burger I had a big long brown hair in it. My girlfriends hair is black and it was actually in the freakin burger.


At this point I am furious and i make a phone, Talk to the manager and before I can tell her what happen, she blows up on me and hangs up. I had to call back under another number just to get them to answer. Some guy this time. I asked him for the managers name and he gave me Debbie Hatchet. I asked for the girls name working the window and he said hold on. Then I hear the girl cussing up a storm about not giving me the number. So they leave me on hold and I hang up.


I don&apos;t want your coupons or your free crap. I want some one to do something about this!! I can&apos;t believe this is how they run their business.

To whom it may concern, I would like to express some concerns about B.K. .I was a frequent customer at your stores until a few years ago when I started to have several bad visits. The 1st was when B.K. started to run adds about the drive thru being open late. On more than two occasions I went to the store on west 49th street and about 9th ave. in hialeah fl. It was 10:30 p.m. once and about 11:00 p.m. another, the other times were all before midnight. On all occasions the store was already closed. Sometimes the lights were off and sometimes there was someone at the window but they told me they had put all the food away. On July 30th/2010 at exactly 10;58 p.m. at your hialeah store on east 49th street and east 8 ave. I tried to order food through the drive-thu and after several hellos no one answered so I drove to the window and I asked a young man (through a closed window,)if the store was open. HE shook his head yes while on the phone but continued to talk on the phone for several minutes whithout ever asking what I wanted to order. I finally drove off without the employee opening the window and trying to make me come back. About 3 weeks ago a friend of mine drove through the a B.K. drive up window and ordered two whoppers and I was very disappionted with the meat. I,m not sure if it wasnt cooked correctly or what the ploblem was but our whoppers tasted aweful. I used to love eating at B.K. but my last experiences have not been pleasant ones . If your going to spend good money on advertisement at laest make sure your stores are really open at the advertised times. Im tired of having to keep going down the street to mcds but its not my fault. On previous times when I did get to the store before it closed every time I ordered something it just so happened that they were either out of that item or the icee and shake machines were not working.I can see them not working but not on THREE STAIGHT OCCASIONS !!! I hope this isnt falling on deaf ears I,m just trying to help. Mt cell number is 786-301-9914. Feel free to contact me any way you wish. Thank you, Antnony revilla.

They swiped my card through drive through 7-23-10 in Jefferson City Missouri. There is no pin or signature required. My receipt showed the proper amount HOWEVER the transaction with ONE transaction number was taken out of my bank account twice. I called to let the local store know and was told I would have to find a printer to print my electronic bank statement and drive back to their store an hour from my home to get my money back!!! No apology other than sarcasm about how did I expect them to take care of it any other way!!!

I hate to tell you this but YOU should&apos;ve checked the amount that they charged your card before signing your signature, or entering your pin number in the chip and pin machine. In other words, you gave your authorization to this transaction by confirming with signature. And if you&apos;re gunna take food home then of course it wont be piping hot!

I had a pretty lousy experience at the Burger King Aggieville location in Manhattan Kansas this afternoon while taking my son out for lunch while shopping. We ordered our meals ,of which mine was the Steakburger XT, We got our meals and sat down. I ate a few fries which were hot and fresh and then opened up my sandwich. To say that I was a bit upset would be a gross understatement. The&quot;steakburger&quot;looked like it must have been sitting around somewhere(not under the heat lamp or anything else even close to warm) and was about as cold as the table I was sitting at under the air conditioner vent. Needless to say, I wasn&apos;t going to eat it, so I allowed my son to finish his meal and took my sandwich up to the counter and asked to see the manager. He came over and asked if there was something wrong, to which I replied&quot;Yes, the fries and shake were great however this Steakburger is cold as ice.&quot;His response was only a dumbfounded look and stunned silence, to which I could only reply&quot;I will never come to this place again&quot;. So, to whomever may read this from BURGER KING MANAGEMENT, YOU JUST LOST A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE. AND I WILL TELL ANYBODY WHO ASKS THAT THEY SHOULD AVOID ALL BURGER KINGS LIKE THE PLAGUE! I hope I got my point across well enough.

i was just at a burger king location in dania beach 1800 sterling road. Standing in lie waiting for my food to be made i saw a rat run into the back of the store towards they were making my whopper. so i decided to look around a little more to see what else could be wrong. i then noticed a very distinct smell of marajuna comming from one of the employees pasing by me. it was funny to me because i know people who were turned down or fired from this very same place because the manager suspected that they were smoking this person did not even bother to cover up the smell a friend of mine told me that the employees and the managers like to sit around and tllk about different experiences while smoking and that they do not follow proper procedure while storing food they dont clean machines and they do not properly dispose of garbage. know that i wil be having an inspector visiting your business i dont want drug addicts and alcholics touching my food i will make sure that people stop visiting this particular burger king i will keep telling people about what i see when i visit i will even go as far as posting signs and verbally telling people to stay away right in front of the establishment i am disgusted

I agree - the same situation happened when I went into the location on Chili Ave in Rochester, NY. I ordered the new sausage muffin sandwich and was advised they ran out. This was at 8am - with 2.5 hours left in the day that seems unacceptable. I asked the girl if she was kidding - her response was&quot;no sir - sometimes we just run out of things. What else would you like today.&quot;After that comment - the manager came over and jumped right in passing the blame by stating&quot;I am sorry sir - the cook just informed me we were out so I was not able to order anything else.&quot;I then asked for an order of the French toast sticks, and guess what .... cook forgot to advised management they were out of those too.


Very disorganized and all in all - will be avoiding burger king in the future. Since their sandwiches are horrible for eating while driving and fast food is the last thing I want unless I am on the run - McDonalds is a much better options with management that keeps on top of inventory and has yet to pass the buck on responsibility.

Dear [burger king],


Philadelphia is drowning in litter. On April 20, 2010, First Philadelphia Charter School for Literacy took a survey of the 4300 block of Tacony Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to find out what kind of litter was on the ground. We found one of your productsâs packaging on the ground. In fact, we found that 39% of all the litter was food&amp;beverage packaging.


We know that it is partly a consumerâs responsibility to throw away their trash properly. However, we also think it a corporationâs responsibility to understand that their products, especially ones made of plastic, will end up as litter. In fact, 42% of the total litter we found was made from plastic. We know that plastic takes many life times, before it degrades. We are writing to urge you to stop using so much plastic packaging.


We learned that petroleum is a dwindling natural resource. Since so much plastic is ending up as litter or in landfills, we do not think this is a good use of this precious natural resource.


After the litter survey, we cleaned up the litter on the 4300 block of Tacony Street on Earth Day this year. We picked up a total of 78.4 pounds of litter on this block alone.


Please, [burger king], we urge you to stop using so much plastic and start using more biodegradable materials. Some other companies are beginning to use biodegradable plastics. You may be making a big profit using plastic, but we, the kids of Philadelphia are drowning in the waste.


Sincerely,

First Philadelphia Charter School Sixth Graders

last week i had a very bad experience i went to a Buger king in park street downtown crossing and when i got in front of the counter i realized that i missed 2 pennies to buy the sandwich and the cashier refused to sell me the sandwich. I explain to her that i didnt have other change and was hungry but she answer me very rude (She said:i dont care). This is not how a customer should be treat. Ive been a faithful custumer to BK befor that, but now everything changed since that day. Im not going to be disrespect by a cashier and you should pay more attention in what kind of people should go in front of a register. Some of them dont belong to the front but the back to make sandwich.

Burger King Corporate Office

Miami, FL 33126


Dear Burger King,

I just came back from a most unpleasant experience at one of your restaurants.

I went to the location in Navarre, FL and thought I would try your new breakfast sandwich that you are spending millions of dollars advertising.

They had signs on all the registers explaining that they had no sausage for the sandwich due to poplar demand.

I say bull.

You have to be to the worst if not the worst run fast food business in the country.

This is why I never go to your store but against my better judgement my wife pleaded with me to try the new sandwich.

So much for that.

All I did was waste my time and gas driving to a burger King that can not sell me what they are spending millions to advertise.

I asked one question in the store while I was there.

WHY?

The answer was , now get this,&quot;we only make minimum wage sir. We went through two boxes of sausages in one day.&quot;

I told them to look around . Your store is empty and soon you will not even be making minimum wage because they will have to close down stores like this one and let people go.

Why, because Burger King is not able to deliver what they advertise!

That is decepitave, incompentant, and why millions of Americans choose to stay away from Burger King ,no matter what you try to do .

McDonalds will also recieve this letter just so they can have a good laugh.

You&apos;re a moron... you state that you paid $6.20 for 3 double quarter pounders AND your mom&apos;s meal? Forget the fact that BK doesn&apos;t sell double quarter pounders... that would put you WAY over $6.20 for all of that food. Also, the incubation period for food poisoning is 12 - 48 hours, so if you were puking, it was most likely from the fact that you ate 3 DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDERS, you fatass!

I visited store 2585 3/27/10 for breakfast. I ordered and after waiting 12 minutes I asked the lady who took my order how much longer, she replied&quot;I have no idea.&quot;I asked her can you give me a time frame? She replied&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;I began to say something else and she yelled for the manager. He came around the corner and asked me if there was something he could get me instead of the biscuits I ordered. He was very helpful. My complaint lies with the young lady (Pamela) name on my receipt, she rang me up. After handing my order to me and saying sorry as I was walking out she deciede to add&quot;Oh my God!&quot;Now I know it was Sat. morning and it gets busy I understand people get busy. But I do not understand the way she reacted!

I had a very similar experience at a Burger King at Phoenix SkyHarbor Airport yesterday. I had a Whopper with tainted lettuce. I was sick with diarrhea for most of the afternoon after eating this. I searched the Burger King website, and there is no easy way to lodge a complaint other than calling a phone number in Florida during working hours.

I just experienced something very similar at the BK in Addison, IL on Rohwling Rd right near the Best Buy.


I should have left even before I got my order. I was in the drive-thru for almost 15 minutes and there was only 3 cars in front of me! Then, I get a medium fry for a large. All the food was cold by the way too. So I have to park and go inside which is only adding insult to injury at this point. I walk up to the counter and the idiot behind the counter just stares at me as I walk up. I took the frys out of the bag handing to him explaining I ordered a large. He then does the same thing to me that the person experienced in this original compliant. He never spoke a single word during this whole exchange. He actually looked like he wanted to kill himself. His custromer service would be just about as effective if he did. Even when I first got my food, when I pulled up to the window there were 3 people including the manager doing God knows what and not one person offered any apologies. The woman handing me my food almost forgot my drink too. If I would have driven away in haste, that easily could have happened. I sat there staring at her thru the window like,&quot;Hey! You forget something?!&quot;There&apos;s another BK about a 1 1/2 miles down the road. I&apos;ll try that one now. If the service and food is better, it will be worth the extra travel. If not, I&apos;ll just end up boycotting BK altogether.


And another thing...why am I writing this here where probably no one will read it..no one will give a crap...and no one will do anythign about it. there is no way to leave feedback on their website and no way am I wasting my time calling. Oh yeah and if you do call, it&apos;s on your dime since the number is not toll-free. WTF??!!!

I have been searching for any comments on Parsippany, NJ Burger King. Then I realized that there could be people like me, just searching but not responding to the issue they faced. So let me be the first in BooRah to comment about this BK.

Yesterday, March 11, 2010 I did a big mistake, I visited this BK store. I purchased Spicy chicken, Whoper, buger shots etc for my family. Came home and ate it, dint feel anything different. But today morning, March 12, 2010 my wife puked and she got diarrhea. My kids too had diarrhea. I was feeling like crap and had severe headache and stomach ache. Check with my wife to see, she too is having severe stomach/headaches. Couldnt point out the issue immediately, both of us couldnt go to work (lost a pay-day) and stayed back to take care of ourselves and the kids. Later we visited the doctor to know that it was food poison. The only common food we had yesterday was from Burger King. So I googled to see anyone else had this issue and tried to give a complaint/feedback to Burger King at www.bk.com. Obviously there is no form/link/section for submitting a feedback/complaint (Wow, such a great company). So I called the consumer/customer service, while my wife and kid couldnt get up and when they were sleeping. They made me wait for over 10 minutes and atlast someone picked up the phone. They asked all my personal details and then said she will register a complaint, she was hell bent on saying its not a BK issue. I kept on asking whether there were any complaint about this BK store from Yesterday, so that I can go to a hospital to prevent from any mishap and be proactive. She said she cant share that information! Then asked her to have someone respond to me as soon as possible by checking the issue, she said it will take 3-4 weeks!!! WHAT??? by then we would be dead or we could be alright, so 3-4 weeks is not an option. They gave me the store phone number, which I already had in my receipt. I do not think they want to help or resolve the issue, rather than that they just want to push the issue from their plate and live out of reality. Am posting this long response, mainly because, if any of you readers had an issue on March 10/11/12th at this BK, then please let us know by entering a comment here. Thus we can visit a hospital and be save in this economical situation.

Thanks a lot for your time and please stay away from this store, be safe!

I see on tv where Burger King has slumping breakfast sales and is now introducing Starbucks coffee to help boost their sales.

I travel around the U.S. for business and have always been a Burger King fan over McDonalds. I only eat breakfast at fast food restaurants normally and feel I can give you a professional opinion on why your sales are slumping.

I found almost all Burger Kings that I visit will always deep fry their french toast sticks and then pile them up to the side. When you order them they dip them back into the deep fryer and serve them. I&apos;ve returned the last two or three orders because of this across the board practice. When you do this the sticks are spongy, soggy, and soft instead of fresh and crispy.

The last two or three visits to Burger King I also found their breakfast sandwiches to be cold or barely warm from stacking them up under the heat light. This is not just one or two places this is all over the east coast. I now eat breakfast at McDonalds because their food is always hot and fresh. I will go back to Burger King if they can get their quality back on line. Managers and Assistant Managers are right there and do not find it in themselves to represent the company in a professional manner to where they would represent what is going on in the kitchen.


Send me around and I&apos;ll keep you informed and up-to-date with quality of product in NC, SC, KY, OH, PA, IN, and MI.

I went to the Burger King at 9803 19th ave SE Everett, WA 98208 and when i got there was a kid that was his first day. He asked for help to fill the order but no one came. He charged me twice the amount of the order on my debit. Well total was 6.21 and he charged 12.21, So i received an over draft fee of 35.00. I asked them to put the money back on the card and the manger there named Stephine on 1/13/2010 @ 8:30pm was very rude and said all she could do was give me cash back. And could not return my money on the card. I was very upset but agreed since i had no choice, then i asked for a comp on the meal cause i had just paid 35.00 for there mistake. She said no they could not do that she said pay for your order or leave. I said thats fine i will pay cause at this point i was starving. I had to wait 23min for 3 double quarter pounders. They had my mothers order done in 2min. I was in shock not only did i get ripped off but i got home. And was so hungry i ate it well it was ice cold and the meat was hard. and there was no way that was a double quarter pounder not only that, i threw up and have been sick ever since. I think they gave me the patty&apos;s that been sitting in there all day cause they were mad. So now i have food poison an over drawn bank account. I bought my mother dinner and she is also sick. If you can avoid this store do so at all costs. I will never return and i mean never!

Three weeks ago my wife and I visited BK at 130 Otis St, Newport News, Va. I informed the manager there were two large pot holes in the driveway. She stated someone had been contacted to repair. Tonight we visited again. The pot holes still have not been repaired.

Two Saturdays mornings ago, group of us (3 men) stoped in at the local Long Beach, MS (39560) Burger King. I would rate the food and at about a&quot;5&quot;. Then last Saturday morning, we decided to try this same Burger King again - couldn&apos;t be any worse - wrong. There was no coffee in the dispenser, the sausage biscuits were cold, the sausage was dry and hard, and the biscuits were dry. The employees were inept - kinda confused. We will not ever return to this establishment again. This does not help to improve the image of Burger King. Someone from corporate should really visit to see just how bad that place is because the owner does not seem to care.

I attended a Burger King recently the number at the topof the check says #212, beside the date it reads 9420 19:52 #14 SEP.03&apos;09 REG0002. Iwaited 15 minutes to get my food and there was 1 customer ahead of me. There were 5 customers in the store, including sitting ones. When I got my original chicken sandwich it was crushed and over cooked. I talked to Manager she cooked another, after 8 mins of waiting the sandwich looked the same and was horrible. I took one bite and threw it away. I spent $13.96 and threw most of my food away. I am never going to Burger King again I feel I was treated unfairly. I complained with the number on back but I am not returing unless someone offers me something better I sent $13.96 I want something equal or more than that horrible customer service and resolution.

15/08/09 i went to the BK in newcastle central station in england, at 1pm, i was served by a guy called michael. Firstly for 5.99 i expected a slightly higher standard than finding my chips all over the bag and the burger looking like a car crash!


my complaint is for the customers be hind me, they had to wait 5mins in an empty shop til this michael guy decided to stop chatting and swearing about how hard his life was and there was a small argument reguarding who was actually supposed to be serving!!

also i watched a manager type girl take the till draw away for counting, then proceeded to count the money on a food prep area in view of the customers, i doubt thats in your manuels!


my email is andythelightsbloke AT hotmail.com

please inform me of what you plan to do to remedy this

8:40 pm. Tuesday. I went to the Burger King on Pelham Road, Greer, South Carolina and ordered my daughter three 4-piece chicken tenders. There was no one behind me, but as usual, the girl at the drive thru window asked me to pull forward for five to ten minutes wait. I pulled forward. After about five minutes I saw my food handed out the drive-thru window to the slobby guy that just came out of the dumpster emptying trash. Gross! He brought my food and handed it to me. He then continued emptying trash from the receptacle I was parked near. I will not be back!

I took my son to the Burger King on Broadway Drive, Hattiesburg, MS on 07/23/2009. We ordered a Whopper Jr. and a Double Cheeseburger. When I took the food to the table, I opened both burgers and saw that they gave us two Whopper Jrs instead. I took one of the burgers back so I could get my correct order. Instead of the worker discarding the burger I brought back, she put it back in the BIN!! YUK!! Surely this is unsanitary! I touched the bun when I checked the burger!! Needless to say, I will not be eating there again. I may cut out fast food altogether!

On June 25th my childern and I went through the drive-thru Burger King in Suamico Wisconsin. A young girl answers the intercom&quot;What do you want to order&quot;No welcome. Between each item she would just say&quot;next&quot;or anything else in a very dry, bores sounding voice. When my order was done she asked&quot;Is that it?&quot;Gave price of $18.09&quot;drive forward&quot;I gave her $20.10. She gives me .63 cents change. I told her What my amount was and I should be getting back $2.01 she rolled her eyes and took back the change. She didn&apos;t apologize. Then when she handed me my sodas the cap wasn&apos;t on tight and when I went to grab it, it spilled all over my car outside and in, my pants and inside the compartments in my vehicle. A very hard to reach spot to clean. It did stain my pants, they were tan. Again she never apologized. She stared at me as I gave her back the drink so I could shake the soda off my hands. I asked her to please get me a napkin so I could dry off my car a little and my pants. She rolled her eyes again and handed me two small napkins. She then told me it would be a while before my order would be finished and please drive around to the other side of the building and wait. We waited for about 7 minutes and then the manager came out with the order and I told her about my experience and the only thing she said was that the attendent must be having a&quot;bad day&quot;She said she was sorry but that was the only excuse she could give. She did offer me a dirty, wet rag to wipe my car with. I told her that it would have made a big difference if she would have just apologized or even a simple I&apos;m sorry. But that never came out of her mouth. Again the manager just said she must be having a bad day.

I too just had a bad day, but I made sure I at least said please for a napkin to wipe my pants and did say thank you for giving it to me.

I was just at a major department store with two very tired childern, going grocery shopping for two hours got in line at the checkout and was told we had to leave right away because of a bomb scare. Had to leave all groceries and supper at the checkout with two very hungry, tired childern oh and did I mentions extremely frightened by the experience. I thought we would have a little better experience going to Burger King to settle them down. And then this all happened.

Thank you for hearing my complaint.

Sincerely,

Janine Barkow

I went to the Burger King on Mockingbird Lane and was inside sitting down at one of the table. Trying to decide what I wanted when one of the employees told me to&quot;Get Out&quot;. She didn&apos;t wait to see if I was going to order something. I told the employee that I was never going to eat at that Burger King ever again. This is the first time that they have been rude to me.

I would like to say I will never go to the Burger King in Route 70 in Cherry Hill again. Placed an order at drive-thru was told to pull in front and food would be out. It took 20 minutes to final get my food...hello is this not a fast food place???I asked to speak to a manager I was told he was cooking and would not come to front to see me. The lady at the register was so rude. Her name was Akilah Mc Lean. I asked several times to speak to him and she was rude ignored me and would not get him. After all of this I was shorted food! I will never go to this BK again and would warn all that go there to beware of the ignorant workers and managers. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE

I went to Burger King on Northern Lights Blvd. here in Anchorage, AK.


I asked for a Double Whopper with Cheese, I showed up in a Taxi Cab. The Girl that was at the window (Tamika) at 9:57 p.m. She was rude and was giving a smirkish prejudice attitude towards me while sitting in the cab. She responded rudely when I asked what was taking so long. It was over 8 minutes for 1 double whopper with cheese. I asked her what was taking so long. She said&quot;just hold on&quot;with a smart/(as* remark). Edwin Cruse was the manager at the time. She had an attitude towards me. We called and spoke with Edwin Cruse he had a negative response and attitude towards my boyfriend at the time to complain to the manager (Edwin). He called us back several times and was apologizing for her attitude because we said we were contacting the Corporation Management. We had good friends go to the same location and they were treated poorly with the employees yelling at the customers. I had gone to Burger King for the last 20 years, not only because I like the burgers but is close to where i live. I would like some results in a positive manner.


If your franchise doesn&apos;t want our money, my husband said McDonalds does.


Thank You.

I was in burgerking newbury (UK) while no one was serving and a manager was walking around with a book on his hand. About 10minutes after waiting, the manager told to a staff member that she had customers. She was apparently serving someone else maybe on drive thru and she told to the manager: why don&apos;t you serve them and it has to be me?? while they were arguing me and customers were waiting to be served. i think it is completely disrespecting to see a manager and a staff member arguing to serve a customer. if the manager doesn&apos;t know how to give an example to a staff member of the store, maybe you should replace him! i didn&apos;t like it at all and i bet the other customers didn&apos;t like it neither. please be careful with your staffs.

Mr. Hyatt,

I am writing to you to complain of your store in Richmond Va. store # 1258. I go to this particular restaurant all the time and every time I go regardless whether it is noon, evening or night, but everytime we ask for shakes their response is the shake machine is down. Seems to me that it is ALWAYS down. I made a comment about it to them and the response I received was:&quot;We have a shake machine but it is down right now.&quot;Then when we got to the window to pick up the order the gentleman there said:&quot;Here are your two cokes.&quot;I corrected him and said,&quot;It was one coke and one sprite.&quot;His response was:&quot;Whatever.&quot;We got the rest of our order and when we got home, the way I ordered it was NOT the way I got it. I asked for extra mayonaise and there was barely any on it at all. I guess your slogan should read,&quot;Have it your way just not the way you want it.&quot;Upon taking a sip from the coke it was terrible. Just about all selter and no coke syrup in it. I mean this is at 12 noon!!! Practically no ice in it. I used to work at a fast food chain many years ago and back then we took pride in what we sold and checked everything. Not to mention the shake machine was never down.......even in the summer time! I am sick and tired of NOT getting what I want when I go this restaurant and the&quot;children&quot;that work there have not the slightest clue as to how to speak to their patrons. This is appalling!!! I sure hope this is NOT how you train your employees to be. I believe I deserve my money back on what I spent there. I have nothing good to say about this particular restaurant what so ever. Including the employees. I would like some satisfaction on this and would like a speedy response to this. I have worked with the public for over 30 years and this experience among many that I have had at this particular location is unacceptable by all means. Sincerely,

Kara Holland

My husband and I have always enjoyed going to burger king. We atleast go once a week most of the time treating our five sons.The service is always slow but i am patient. Being a mother of five I gladly enjoy someone making me dinner. We live in London Ontario the store I would like to file a complaint about is located on 1075 Commissioners Rd E/ Pondmills Rd N5Z 4L8. We were exausted from our busy day and like all Fridays I don&apos;t feel like cooking. We decided to go to burger king for a quick dinner. Ha!!! Our cashier was hopefully in training he got our order wrong not once twice but three times. We laughed this off as comical he looked like Bubba from the movie Forest Gump. The manager stepped in and helped finish place the order. We ordered 2 # 2 double whoopers compo&apos;s one root beer one coke and a junior whooper. Basic, right! Even though no matter what time you go and the fact that there is never more than six orders on the go there is a wait. As you wait for your food you go fill up your ketchup cups grab your napkins staws ect. Have a breaf conversation with my husband find a spot to sit ect. They do the drinks first unsure of our order there is about fifteen order slips coming out of the print out machine. We wait..... ahah i see the whooper 2... wait ...wait .... ok there is no one else put the burgers on my tray please....someone asks about uor order.....young kid gets our fries grabs burgers.....ah purfect jr whooper is done I look down to grab the tray and a atleast week old blue bandaid that was wrapped around someone&apos;s thumb was resting on top of my fries. (YUK)o.k. shit happens the manager speaks up we will just give you new food, you just go sit down and we will bring it to you. Cool although I did loose my hunger. we sit and wait and wait I&apos;d say 6 mins. I look up young guy moves the tray around uh your food is done asked if we got or needed drinks. we said yes. He seemed upset he looked at me and waited... then decided to bring us our food .We were the only customers at that time. AH FOOD ... THE FRIES WERE COLD SO WERE THE BURGERS THE POP WATERED DOWN MY HUSBANDS BURGER THEY FORGOT CAME PIPPING HOT BUT AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS I THINK THEY MICROWAVED IT THE BREAD WAS SOGGY AND MY HUSBAND DIDN&apos;T EVEN FINISH IT. WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION OUR NEW FOOD WAS OUR OLD THEY DIDN&apos;T GIVE OUR RECEIPT AND THEY OVER NOOKED OUR JUNIOR BURGER TO THE POINT OF NO CONSUMTION. WHAT A SHAME YOU HIRE IDIOTS THAT REPRESENT YOUR COMPANY YOUR FOOD IS GREAT AND YOU HAVE LOYAL PATIENT CUSTOMERS. OUR FAMILY HAS ALWAYS PREFERRED BUGER KING BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE STAFF RUN YOUR COMPANY THAT HANDLE REGULAR PAYING CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT ANYWHERE EVEN OUT OF OUR WAY WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE TO DINE THAN YOUR CORPORATION BURGER KING.

I&apos;m complaining that there is SAND(Glass) in my BK Ketchup&amp;Fries Flavored Potato Snacks! I read the back and found Silicon Dioxide in the ingredients! This is NOT digestable, nor Nutritious!


Not to mention that I was severly disappointed with the taste. They taste awful.


I do not recommend any of these similar products they sell

I am writing to complain about all of the Burger Kings in Slidell, Louisiana and I visited one outside of Mobile, Alabama and have had the same experience at all of them. It does not matter if there is one customer or 50 you always have to wait forever before giving your order and receiving your food. For example, I visited the Burger King on Gause Blvd. in Slidell, Louisiana last week and when pulling up to BK there was one car in the drive thru and maybe three customers inside. We were asked, not so politely, to wait a minute. After about 3 minutes my husband said hello to make sure that they knew we were still waiting and the crew member siad&quot;I told you to wait a minute&quot;after waiting about another 3 minutes we decided to leave and just go to McDonalds. Another example is the store outside of Mobile Alabama. Last summer we were coming home from Gulf Shores Alabama and decided to stop at the BK outside of Mobile when we pulled up to the drive thru we were told that the drive thru was closed (it was only around 5 P.M) and that we had to go inside so we did. After placing our order we waited, along with about 7 other customers, for at least 45 minutes. It always seems that everytime we go to BK we always have issues. I believe over the years Burger King has gone down hill which is really sad because I have always beleived BK has had much better food than McDonalds but I would rather go to McDonalds because you get much better service and definately in a much more timely fasion.

Burger King
Owatonna, MN 55060


I am complaining about the Burger King in Owatonna Minnesota. My husband and I were there this morning and had breakfast. As we were leaving I seen an employee, named Linda eat potato rounds out of the heating bin. First of all,I thought it was very unprofessional to see an employee eat out of the bin. Hands weren&apos;t even washed as she continued. I am sorry, but I will not return to the Burger King when she is working. I will leave. It made my stomach sick to see something like that.

I have just visited one of your burger kings whilst in holiday in Fuengirola, Spain at Myamar retail complex.

22-09-08 @ 19:00 hours approx

It was the most unpleasant experience, not because of the food but because of the staff. My friend gary is a little on the large side and a little timid.

I noticed one of the female staff whisper something to her friend who looked over and burst out laughing, then she spoke to another female collegue who also looked in his direction and smirked. Then to top it off the manager was called to the front and something was said to him, he poked his head around looked at my friend and i could also see him laugh.

At this point i knew i could not complain to the manager as he thought what ever was said was amusing. I find this disgusting and intolerable, it was obvious to me it was about his looks or his size which to me seem as awful as racism. I will also take this up with the manager of Myamar Parque, Fuengirola, Spain.

My friend laughed it off but this has left a horrible memory of my visit to Spain as i live in the uk and have not ever experienced this ever there.

Please get back to me as soon as possible as i am only in Spain until 26-09-08. I would like to have a sincere apology from the staff and would also like to know they have been disciplined or even relieved of their position, i am that angry about this.


Yours hopefully


Spencer davis.

Wwe purchased 7 chicken tender sandwiches and when we got home we had chicken nuggets in whopper buns! we bought 2 fries for a total of $10.39 at store 13273, check#564, sale #18460764, drawer 7, timothy. we dialed phone #1-515-962-2055 and let it ring 50 times,3 times in a row! time was 6:48 pm on thursday sept. 18, 2008. store located in Indianola,Iowa.


We did finally get someone to answer and the manager said WE needed to be more specific about what WE wanted.

We ordered exactly what was on the menu, a chicken tender sandwich, not a chicken NUGGET sandwich, which is not even close to what we received. All the other BK&apos;s have strips in these sandwiches, not nuggets. I think they wer just to lazy to fix them correctly. And what do they say about going through the drive thru?!??! They knew we wouldn&apos;t know what we got until we were too far away to go back. And I don&apos;t see anywhere that BK does anything about these complaints. You can&apos;t see if they ever respond, or even read them. Would be nice to know!

We ate at the Burger King on 8775 Washington Blvd in Jessup, MD. My chicken sandwich was room temperature and dry. The fries were also dry and only slightly warm and tasted like its been sitting around for hours. I told my husband that I don&apos;t remember BK ever being so horrible as this time. he said what did i expect from a fast food. Ha, that&apos;s not all. My 2 year old son had a Jr. whopper sandwich and had acid reflex after a few bites. He pushed it away and my husband finished it. That wasn&apos;t the worst part. When we got home, my son complained of stomach pains and had a sour look on his face. He then threw up all over his bed. My husband had diarrea and sat on the toilet for an hour. What did I expect from a fast food restaurant? I could deal with luke warm fries but the getting sick part was just unacceptable.

I was at the burger king in holland michigan.2378 North park dr Holland,mi 49424. My co worker and I went their for lunch my cheesy tots were soaked in grease and the grease was black. My coworker ordered the chicken sandwhich with bacon the first one was over cooked the the second one did not get the bacon on so she took it up their for a third time and the employee behind the counter put bacon on her sandwhich with his bare hands no gloves or nothing. The pop machine was dirty and the pop was flat.the whole restaurant was was just nasty. The mamager acted liked she had an attitude with us. I am very unhappy and they did not really offer any apoligy to us. i will never eat at burget king again in my life.I was upset because I like to eat at burger king I thought it was have it your way I guess not huh? I hope they get it together over there if not they will lose all of their business. I will let the people know at work not to eat their. I work at Wal-mart across the street. Thank you for your time

Please help... I don&apos;t know where to file my complaint. I cannot click the link to email someone who might care so I went to my local police department to file a complaint. Last week at your Layton, Utah store your operating partner decided to attack and fire my cousin. The problem is he did so in an inappropriate manner in front of my 3 children, ages 12, 8, and 2. I found out about the incident 3 days later when I questioned why my 2 year old was walking around saying the&quot;F&quot;word. I asked my 12 year old what happened and he said he was scared because the OP was yelling and swearing at their uncle in the play land during lunch rush and he felt like they were not aloud to be there and didn&apos;t understand why. The thing is my husband and I don&apos;t condone this behavior in our home nor do we use that language around our kids let alone each other. I was quite upset and filed a disorderly conduct and harrassment complaint with our police department and I want to be sure that the situation is handled appropriately. I look forward to your response as I would hope this doesn&apos;t go ignored.


Sincerely,

Kelly Pierce,

A concerned parent

I WENT TO NEW ORLEANS AND I NOTICED THAT THEY WEREN&apos;T WEARING GLOVES AND REQUESTED THAT THEY WERE GLOVES WHEN THEY COOKED MY ORDER AND THE CASHIER WENT THE MANAGER&apos;S OFFICE AND SHE(MANGER-DEBRA)CAME OUT OF THE OFFICE AND ADVISED ME THAT THEY DIDN&apos;T USE GLOVES AND WHEN I ASKED THEY USED THEM FOR MY ORDER SHE JUST KEPT REPEATING THEY DIDN&apos;T USE THEM. I THEN ASKED DID THEY HAVE GLOVES IN THE STORE AND SHE JUST LOOKED AT ME, SO I PROCEEDED TO CANCEL MY ORDER. MANAGEMENT WAS NASTY, RUDE, AND TO SAY THE LEAST CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WERE THE HORRIBLE AND I WOULD NEVER VISIT THERE AGAIN.

Today I was at the BK in Austin, TX on Guadalupe St. 78705, this location serves mostly to the university of Texas students. I ordered #9 chicken sandwich, when I opened the wrap, the meat was burnt and in a deep brown color, it was dried flat. I took it back and told them I need a new sandwich since this one was burnt, the sales guy at the counter told me not to complaint and the meat is NOT burnt. How is it not burnt when the meat is dried flat in a deep brown color? Another person walked up shortly after I demanded for a new sandwich and complaint the same thing. They did give me another sandwich, but it was the same meat from the one before that. I will NEVER eat at BK ever again!

What has happened to our beloved Burger King!? I do NOT want a coupon for a free burger, I just want Burger King to return to good standards.

While traveling though Mt Shasta, CA, we stopped at a BK and received not only the wrong drink, but a watered down version of a different soda! And it took almost fifteen minutes for two drinks and a small snack (without a car line!). Also similar problems at my local BK in Gardnerville, NV. So sad that I can not return to BK.. too substandard. VS

I live near a Burger King located at 1209 Leonard St. NW, Grand Rapids MI 49504. I only go there for breakfast and CANNOT BELIEVE the poor service! Once, the employee did not know how to make the cheesy bacon wrap, once they had no wraps (sold out), a couple times the girls were out smoking by the dumpster and had to run inside when I pulled up, but WORST OF ALL about 25% of the time I&apos;m told&quot;we cant take orders for 20 minutes&quot;. I get there early - about 4:10 AM (Breakfast starts at 4), but if you are going to claim you are open for 24 hrs, and have the sign on - be prepared for people to come in. After getting denied this morning - I&apos;m done going there. Theres a mcd&apos;s accross the street - never had a problem with them.

I was at the Burger King located on Military Hwy(Janaf Shopping Ctr) Norfolk, Va at 1pm today. Only 2 girls were at the front counter, Kim and the manager, Ms. Winn. I waited 15 minutes to order and 15 minutes before I received my order. Kim was inexperienced, tired and slow. And Ms. Winn was busy with the front and drive-in. At the time of my ordering, there were 12-15 customers behind me.


From my observation, there should be at least 3 or 4 experienced employees up front.

I ordered a Rodeo Cheeseburger at the drive through at 1:29pm on 5/25/08 at store #4075 in So SF. The burger was not hot - it was lukewarm- and the cheese-food was not melting. I turned the car around, parked and went in to the store to complain. The older Asian-American woman at the counter could barely comprehend the problem. After a few minutes I was given a freshly (over) nuked sandwich. The bun had steamed to mush and the cheese was liquid, but at least this time the burger was hot.

Dear Jim Hyatt, I was a customer at the Burger King in Gonzales, Louisiana on May 12th of 2008. The young lady took my order and I asked could my chicken sandwich be cut into three pieces for my grandchildren, who were ages 2,3, and 4 years of age. The manager was in the back and screamed to the girl at the counter, swearing in a way that I would have never thought of this at a restaurant. This woman was so nasty with the words that came out of her mouth, that I asked for my money back, and she then told the young lady to give her back the damn money then. I would appreciate it if you would see to it that the managers at this store would be respectful to the customers as well as the workers. This was uncalled for and I was very disappointed with this location.

Burger King service has definitely gone down. I went into a Burger King today and the employees were so FAKE it almost made me not want to eat. and to top it off when I try to play the online game with the codes I received, the game doesn&apos;t even work. Burger King has now become a joke to me. I&apos;d rather go to McDonald&apos;s now. At least they don&apos;t have cold onion rings.


At least someone feels the same way I do. Have it your way. yeah right.

I do believe that Burger King is sending

our kids the wrong message in the new

Burger King commercials about violence

and that violence should be taken

seriously, I am talking about the comm-

ercial with 2 cars at the Drive Thru

window and one car bumps the other car

and pushes it out of the way this is

violence plain and clear and here is

Burger King promoting violence for our

children and saying this is ok no it is

not ok our children will see this and

think this is ok to do

This morning I went to the Burger King in Swannannoa, NC. From inside the store, my daughter and I simply ordered a plain biscuit and a bacon, egg&amp;cheese croissant combo (no special order, just a regular combo). When we came in, no one was behind us. After we had ordered and were getting our drinks, a man, a girl and another man came in, all separately. All were given their food before we were even addressed again. I asked the girl at the counter, why the 3 people who came in after us had their meals and we were still waiting. She made a face and said,&quot;they only had 1 thing each and you ordered a bunch of stuff.&quot;, in a very smartass tone. The man behind us ordered a sausage biscuit&amp;coffee, the girl ordered 2 breakfast burritos and a drink, the next guy ordered 2 sausage biscuits. I ordered a plain biscuit and 1 regular combo meal.


I was upset and I told my daughter that it was not right that we were still waiting. The RUDE girl whipped around to me and said,&quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY?&quot;and I told her that i was not talking to her. We waited a few more minutes, and I asked how much longer, that we had to go. She stuck her tongue out, crossed her eyes and wiggled her head from side-to-side and made fun of me for simply asking how much longer it was going to be.


We walked in BK at exactly 7:30 where one high school kid was placing his order before we even got to the line. We ordered immediately and waited exactly 20 minutes before our food was given to us, while 5 other customers all ordered behind us and got their meals and were on their way.


After we left, I called the manager, his name was Jason, and I told him what had happened. He said that my sandwich had been left in the microwave and that that commonly happens. I asked him if he realized that people were trying to get to school and to work on time and he said,&quot;uh .. Ya!&quot;I told him about the rude girl and he said he would talk to her. He was not very nice either in his tone. After the call to the manager, I them opened my sandwich and found a cold stiff croissant with a slab of cheese on it, which had CLEARLY NOT been in the microwave.


I returned to the business and asked for my money back, where he simply said, that the sandwich had cooled before i got it from sitting in the microwave. Now idk about anybody else, but I can tell if bread had been nuked or when cheese has been in a microwave .. Clearly, he was simply making stuff up to cover for the extremely rude counter girl. This is not right. Bad Manager and even Worse Counter Person!! Terrible service, even worse turnaround time on an order and not the quality of meal that I had paid for. We stopped for Breakfast to start a good day, but this was a rotten start for both our days. Nobody deserves to have a smartass counterperson stick their tongue out and make fun of them for simply asking a question.. or have a manager then try to cover for them with an obvious lie.


I will NOT be back, but more importantly -- my money will not be back!

This complaint is in reguards to your store in Chicago at the corner of Southport and Fullerton Street. I was not able to assertain any other information from the person who was extremly rude and inept, not to mention a racist. She refused to take my childs coupond for her free kids meal, because according to her you must mention it when you order. When I told her that I would report her and asked for the telephone number she told me to look it up. If i was White I&apos;m sure she would not have been such a Bitch to me, she told me her name was shandrell.

I went through the drive through about a month ago and order a large drink, two crispy chicken sandwhiches and two plain cheeseburgers and a large fry. I paid for the food and took my children to grandmas for the evening. When we pulled in the drive way i went to get the food out and there were no burgers. the fries were cold and the crispy chicken sandwhich was actually nuggets on a bun ( wierd huh) so grandma fed the kids pbjs and me and my husband went back to burger king to pick up the rest of the food. we did not get a receipt either. so i go in the store and ask for the manager... manager says how can i help you... i say i came in about 15 min ago and i explained what happend and wanted my food or money back. she said you will have to talk to so and so tommorow. i ask her if she could make my food and she said she didnt think i had ever been there and she would do nothing for free. i said to one of the gals working the window do you remember me just a min ago the manager signels the girl to be quiet.. i tell the manager that i had a mri done and needed to eat and that would she make me my order. .. she said she epliptic and that i was a f**** B*** and to leave. i never was rude to her i just was asking for good customer service... so i left the restraunt and as i was walking out she was going off on the staff about me... their were kids in the store the whole time this was happeniing. please fire rebecca slyter 4176739210 the number to call and ask for miranda the recipt policy includes not giving recipts to drive through customers

I visited Burger King restaurant #00035, on 4498 Mobile Hwy, Pensacola, FL, (850)456-3965 on January 19, 2008 at 3:34pm. My order was #189, eating in Whopper, king fries, medium soda.


I really do like Burger King onion rings, and am happy about king size service when I order fries. I am particularly fond of Burger King&apos;s&quot;Zesty Cheese Sauce&quot;for dipping my onion rings, hash browns and/or fries, as I do not care for ketchup. I am always happy with my Burger King meal, and, have been a loyal customer since Burger King gave away free whoppers, decades ago.


My complaint is that when I requested zesty cheese sauce from a behind the counter employee waiting on my order, an adult Caucasian female Baby Boomer employee, also behind the counter, interrupted to inform me that Burger King had asked her to let customers know they could not have zesty cheese sauce unless they ordered onion rings, and it was not something Burger King was going to keep further, on standard supply. This adult was offensive to me and her uniform was covered in grease and salt waste. The actual employee who waited on my order, an African American adult male Baby Boomer, walked over to my table to make sure everything was as I wish (he had given me the zesty cheese sauce at the counter and remained silent). I was very pleased with his comments, as with the rest of the Burger King employees staffed at that time, and, he volunteered the adult female&apos;s name was something such as Jane Grey.


I really cannot imagine what the adult Caucasian female Baby Boomer/Jane Grey was doing based on no ketchup order from me. I most certainly would like to see Burger King zesty cheese sauce stay around for a long time, and in good supply.


Your sincere customer,

Kyra Ann Parker Nelson&quot;Annie&quot;

We are at Carrollton,Ky, We had been going to King about three times a week.

The past few months the tables, seats and floors have been very unclean,

The rest rooms are not fit to go in,they are dirty and smell.

We started going there when it first opened,back then it was clean.

They obviously don&apos;t care or they would have a complaint link on their site. My suggestion is to boycott them till they begin to care.

Just remember thats what happened to Kmart. They stopped caring about the customer and along came Walmart. Kmart was left behind...way behind.

Burger King wake up. Tell then you are No Service King.

I visited your establishment yesterday Oct.12 at 1:35pm. Store number 2784 on Queens Blvd in New York city.I ordered a whopper,whopper combo meal two whopper juniors and you had a promotion that had two whoppers for 3 dollares we noticed when we sat down because your sign was hidden behind the soda dispensors. So when we asked how come no one told us about the sale the manager(Tolba,Ema)was really rude she told as your policy was that they are not supposed to tell us about the sale and i though that is a little wrong i over paid almost 5 dollares it&apos;s not about the money but i would think u should atleast tell your staff to be a little bit more informative...
