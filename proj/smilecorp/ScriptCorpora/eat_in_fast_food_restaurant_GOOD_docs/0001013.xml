 Ask to see the wine list. If you&apos;re ordering meat, order a merlot, a burgundy, or a red. If you&apos;re ordering seafood, order a sauvignon or a chardonnay, or white. A blush wine mixes well with either.

 I would tell the lady that I would just be having a beer, and ask her if she wished to have wine or something else and she wanted wine, ask her to suggest something and when the wine waiter comes to the table ask him/her to recommend some wine, say a merlot, the lady would like.

I have observed many women who will as for a carafe of the house red, or white.
The choices is generally limited but the wine is often as good as a bottle of expensive stuff and it isn&apos;t overly expensive.

 All good answers. I agree with everything that&apos;s been said.

I&apos;m just adding that it&apos;s always interesting to ask your sommelier or wine steward what he or she recommends. The follow up question would then be how is the house wine. This is just giving you both info and you are not ordering for your date. You are gathering information..... Nothing wrong with that. (Of course, while this banter is going on, you can be reviewing the wine list for prices, etc.)

 Your date will be perfectly capable of ordering a glass of her favorite wine for herself. No sense buying a whole bottle if you&apos;re not going to have any. The waiter should address the woman first and she&apos;ll order her wine, then you order whatever you want to drink. There&apos;s no shame in passing on the wine if you don&apos;t like wine. And if it&apos;s the sommelier offering, just say&quot;No thank you, I&apos;ll pass on the wine tonight.&quot;They understand, don&apos;t feel pressured to buy something you won&apos;t drink.

 I would be almost offended if a guy chose my choice of drink for me.
Just relax.. She may not even like wine.
Once you are sitting down at the restaurant, you ask her if she would like some wine. If she likes wine she will probably know which kind to order. Just admit to her that you don&apos;t know much about wine but it would be nice to try what she picks. It would come off as more personal and then she knows a little more about you. (First date type of thing)

 I&apos;ve always ordered my wine or drink myself. I&apos;m sure your date would expect to order for herself. If you know what she wants and you prefer to order for her, all you ask for is a glass or bottle of the __(blank)__. Look at the wine menu and decide which brand and type you/see wants.
