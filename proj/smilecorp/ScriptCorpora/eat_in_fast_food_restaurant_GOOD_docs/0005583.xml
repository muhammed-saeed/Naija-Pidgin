Thank you for visiting ChefMoz.org. For more than 10 years, ChefMoz was the largest international online directory of restaurants and reviews, covering more than 300,000 restaurants in 142 countries. Unfortunately, due to persistent hardware issues and a lack of resources, we have been forced to make the difficult decision to place ChefMoz on an indefinite hiatus.

We would like to extend our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the thousands of volunteer editors who devoted countless hours toward building ChefMoz, as well as to the tens of thousands of members of the public who submitted reviews and added restaurant information. Your altruistic efforts created a tremendously valuable, freely-available resource, and exemplified the highest ideals of the web community.

While we hope that the ChefMoz project will be revived in the future, you can still find information about restaurants from our actively maintained sister project, DMOZ , which contains tens of thousands of links to restaurants and restaurant review sites.

Respectfully yours,

The Open Directory Project Staff
