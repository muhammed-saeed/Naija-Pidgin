How much dip does it hold?
 How much does it hold? It looks tiny, will you be able to get a regular
potato chip or tortilla chip down in it or is it too small/narrow? asked 2 years, 1 month ago By: humming on K29048 - 6-piece Personal Size Chip&amp;Dip Tray Set 4 answers Answers answer 1 the dip slot is a little narrow - a bit larger than the paper ketchup cups you get at burger king. These plates are kid size, to small for an adult answered 1 year, 10 months ago By: Aly-Rhodo answer 2 The dip area is a bit small but it you fill it high you can manage to get dip onto the chip ... certainly not as easy as a large chip and dip platter (BUT then again there is always the person who double dips into those and then I am done) for personal size it works ok answered 2 years ago By: Beachdaze44 answer 3 Yes, they are tiny, however they held two (2) Soup spoonfuls of dip and caramel. There was adequate room for dipping and we were pleased with these. I just tried a potato chip in the dip cup and it worked fine. Didn&apos;t break the chip to fit, so hope this helps, I think you would find that these even though they are small holds a great deal. answered 2 years, 1 month ago By: apoplectic answer 4 The dip cup is about the size of a dipping sauce from a fast food restaurant. You could not realistically put a chip in there. Baby carrots would be about the only thing that would fit. answered 2 years, 1 month ago By: neenacp 1 of 1
