 September 7, 2010 Likes it Suits in Strange Places I always look forward to a trip to Elliston Place Soda Shop whenever I’m in Nashville. The place is like an unchanging rock among a churning sea of bad taste. More from Suits in Strange Places

 August 5, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Why did they stay open? by Friendly ( 15 reviews ) I like to try everything once. This had been one of the biggest fails. I took my mom who was visiting. The OJ was from a gun (gross), the plates were dirty, and the service was miserable. I could have done much better at home in my clean kitchen for less money as well. April 16, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Gregory McCubbin ( 106 reviews ) Cool throwback soda shop on Elliston. Great place to go for golden crinkle fried and a tasty malt. Check it out! October 30, 2010 Really likes it One of my favorites anywhere by BillVol ( 262 reviews ) This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. As another reviewer said, the milkshakes are the star here. They are great, made with Nashville&apos;s Purity ice cream. However, I think the food is very good, too. Classic diner burger. I&apos;ve tried the veggies and they are quite good. The atmosphere is just about without equal. June 16, 2010 Likes it Great milkshakes, average food by Lisa Marie ( 31 reviews ) I know a lot of other people have complained about the dinginess or dirty atmosphere of this restaurant, but what do you expect? It&apos;s an old building, and there&apos;s only so much you can do to keep the structure looking new. I&apos;ve never seen the actual floor or tables looking dirty, and that&apos;s enough for me. The food is what you could find at any fast food restaurant, but the milkshakes are so good! Made with real ice cream, instead of soft serve. One milkshake is definitely enough to serve two. This is also a great central location for Vanderbilt people, and the general downtown public. July 12, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by GoodFood ( 15 reviews ) Overpriced&amp;greasy August 4, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it questionable hours by Paul ( 8 reviews ) We decided to get a burger and a shake on a warm afternoon. We had seen how Elliston Place Soda Shop almost closed due to rent problems and some how was reprieved. My wife and I entered Elliston Place Soda Shop at 4:20pm. We were told at the door that they were closing for the day, right before the dinner hour. They were polite and said they were working on getting a evening shift. They offered to do a to go order but, we weren&apos;t enthusiastic about eating in the car on the street on a 100 degree day. I may be missing something but, it does not make sense for any restaurant to close right before one of the busiest and most profitable times. I believe in supporting small business and I&apos;m not real crazy about chain places either, especially in hard economic times. I looked online to see what their hours are one website said 2:45pm, one said 3:00pm another said 5:00pm. I&apos;m not trying to down the place, just a little confused. I haven&apos;t even had a chance to eat there yet !!! I just wanted to let people know. I will try again in the future, now that I know better.
