I have never had such horrible service in my life. I am a server myself so I will let a lot of things go. But all 3 times I have been here I have gotten horrible service. I believe in giving second chances and with this place I gave them a third. The first time I was there I didn&apos;t get what I ordered I didn&apos;t get drink refills and the server never came back to ask if everything was okay. The second time I was there the server was rude, took our order and I didn&apos;t see my server again until they brought the check. The last time I was there my server again was rude, never brought me my salad but charged me for 2 salads that I never got and never came back by my table. Then when I asked to speak with a manager I waited 10 minutes and the manager never came over. I will never go back.
