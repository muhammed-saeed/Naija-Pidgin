 I’ve work as a part time service crew in a fast food chain 12 years ago,I am studying in the morning and working in the evening. Working in a fast food is not that easy for me, the company is paying me in per hour basis. But the work is not a bit tough, I first work in the kitchen and after a month I was promoted to be a cashier and at the same time serving food to the customer.
Being a service crew you need to be attentive, be friendly and everything you do should be accurate to prevent customer complaints. As a service crew you have to be professional enough to handle customer and attend to their needs as soon as possible and possessed a neat and formal uniform to be more presentable when taking orders to customer.
A service crew perform a lot of task in a fast food chain, we also doing monthly inventories and cleaning the area every night. We guarantee that we used a first in first out basis in our products and disregard those expired one. We have a standard serving time so we should work fast in the counter to be able to serve our customers in time. A fast and accurate service is the best thing we could give to our customer so they will going to go back.
I have work 1 and half year in a fast food chain and I learned a lot of things, being patient and work hard to serve people and to earn money for my self. One of the best work I had is being a service crew because I felt to being dependent and work hard for the money I spent.I am thankful that there’s a lot of company who gives opportunity to those working student so they can be able to save money for their needs. And I am proud to be one of them who performed the best skills that I had to serve different kind of customers.
