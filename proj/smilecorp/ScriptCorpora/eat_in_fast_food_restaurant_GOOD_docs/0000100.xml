A bad experience yields a frank conversation

After I did a blog post on a one-two punch of bad experiences I had at the Friendy&apos;s on Western Avenue in Guilderland, Ron Oliveri , the regional director of operations for Friendly Ice Cream Corp., asked if I&apos;d be willing to get together and talk about the exceptionally slow service I experienced (despite a near-empty restaurant), as well as how my lost credit card was handled. I wrote back and said I&apos;d be happy to meet for SuperMelts if I could bring along a few questions from readers.

He agreed.

We discussed dirty restaurants, server attitude and hamburgers on grilled bread (not toast), among other topics. The interview is edited for length:

Q: Readers complained that service at most area Friendly&apos;s restaurants is notoriously slow (sometimes they wait up to an hour for their food). Friendly&apos;s is, basically, a fast food restaurant — with a target audience of families. Wouldn&apos;t efficiency be paramount when you know you have hungry kids waiting in the booths?

A: Sometimes it&apos;s time, and sometimes it&apos;s the perception of time. The average customer spends 44 minutes in our restaurant. We realize Friendly&apos;s is a family restaurant and people visit with children, but everything is cooked to order, and sometimes that takes time.

Q: The other problem is the window. I have been the second person in line at the Latham location and still waited nearly 25 minutes between the time I get in the vestibule until I am back in the car. The young man tending to the carry-out area is also making the ice cream for the restaurant. My readers have similar complaints about East Greenbush, Guilderland, Colonie, Troy and other locations. Shouldn&apos;t the take-out window be the most efficiently run stop in the restaurant?

A: Yes, it should. Twenty-five minutes is too long, and I&apos;ll look into that.

At the carry-out, we staff according to the number of ice cream products. Sometimes it&apos;s a staffing issue. We are more lightly staffed during non-peak hours. If we forecast properly, that would not happen. It&apos;s not one person&apos;s job to prepare the ice cream for in-house and take care of the window. We need to be more aware of events in the area to better anticipate peak hours.

Q: One thing people like about chain restaurants is that they&apos;re predictable. You can go to a Friendly&apos;s here or 100 miles from the Capital Region, and the quesadillas should taste exactly the same. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case. What causes the inconsistency between locations?

A: We have a spec for every product, so everything should taste the same. When it doesn&apos;t, that comes down to staffing and training. (Basically he explained that if staff is new/not as well trained, your food can be affected.) If guests are unhappy with their food, they should talk to the manager or call the number on the bottom of each receipt. Every complaint is addressed.

We are a family restaurant that has been in business for generations. We realize if you&apos;re an adult and your ice cream isn&apos;t the way you remember it when you were a kid, we aren&apos;t doing our job. We need to work on consistency so we don&apos;t lose customers to similar restaurants in the same category.

Q: What happened to burgers on toast, rather than buns?

A: It really wasn&apos;t toast, but grilled bread. That was called a set-up and it was many, many, many, many years ago. We constantly make changes to remain competitive. We&apos;re always coming out with new promotions to stay fresh with guests. Our next promotion doesn&apos;t involve burgers, but we do still have one burger that comes on grilled bread.

Q: Cleanliness was a huge issue for readers. I know that the location on Western Avenue, Guilderland (the one where I had all those issues), regularly smells like grease and smoke. Also, the floors are always slick. I remember my mom noticing this when I was a kid, so it&apos;s nothing new. Why can&apos;t they keep the restaurant clean (even first thing in the morning)?

A: The issues (smell, grease) could be because that&apos;s a center-kitchen set-up. There isn&apos;t a wall blocking the kitchen from the rest of the restaurant. As for the rest of the restaurant, we dry and wet mop and Shop-Vac the floor each night. The entire restaurant is cleaned each night.

Q: How about the uniforms? My readers said some waitstaff wear dirty shirts and aprons caked with unidentifiable crust. They also wear gloves to prepare a sundae and take money, never changing the gloves despite going back and forth between handing payments and food.

A: We supply aprons and hats, but the crew level is responsible for their own uniforms (black chinos and one of several colored polo shirts). They are expected to come to work each day with a freshly laundered uniform. They may spill on themselves while preparing food, but we always have extra aprons available.

Gloves should not be worn to handle money and food. Do not hesitate to ask the team member to change his or her gloves if you see this happening. You can also mention it to the manager. They should always change their gloves.

Q: Readers are curious about the &quot;major inspection&quot; that the Guilderland Friendly&apos;s was preparing for while I was there. So am I. They were taking down the ceiling vents and cleaning in the crevices with their fingernails. They were also painting the trim on the bathrooms. When I went back the next morning for my credit card, the restaurant looked like it was new. It didn&apos;t smell, the floors weren&apos;t slick, and the waiters and waitresses had on clean shirts.

A: Twice a year, (the company does) a comprehensive restaurant inspection. You were there the night before the district manager was coming in to spend the day with the general manager. The comprehensive restaurant inspection is basically a major coaching session. The DM comes in and analyzes everything from how the restaurant looks from the street to product to the position of the staffing. After you have an inspection, you develop an improvement plan. The DM then reviews the restaurant in six months to see how the restaurant is doing working toward their improvement/goals. Everybody has pride the day before and the whole team rallies together to make sure the restaurant looks as good as it can. That should not have been happening at the last minute.

Q: What&apos;s your policy on credit cards that are left behind? Calling about your lost card is not the same as trying to track down a lone mitten, yet it was treated as such. Why such a lackadaisical attitude?

A: This was handled improperly due to a lesser-experienced management team at this restaurant. They let themselves get distracted preparing for this inspection and they didn&apos;t properly handle your issue. The card was in the safe the entire time. This has been turned into a training opportunity for the staff, and the proper procedure has been stressed.

Q: Speaking of attitude, why does Friendly&apos;s have a reputation for being ... less than friendly? Dozens of readers complained about surly waitstaff and rude managers.

A: We strive to hire people best suited for this business. That starts with friendliness and how you treat guests. The service industry is about constant training and coaching and praising. If we have an individual who seems to be struggling, we coach and guide them the best we can. If there is no improvement, we then need to determine if they&apos;re having a bad day or if there is another industry better suited for them. [He went on to explain that Friendly&apos;s is a first job for many and, while it may seem obvious to most of us how to properly behave in a professional environment, we all also know that&apos;s not always the case.

There are terrible, grumpy, inefficient employees everywhere. And ... it doesn&apos;t help that the restaurant industry is notorious for low retention/high turnover, which makes intense training difficult.

[He also points out that they have waitstaff who have been with the company for more than 20 years. As with any restaurant, that is the exception.]

Q: Any chance you&apos;ll have gluten-free menu options anytime soon?

A: I am not sure what research and development is working on the moment, so I cannot answer that with certainty.
