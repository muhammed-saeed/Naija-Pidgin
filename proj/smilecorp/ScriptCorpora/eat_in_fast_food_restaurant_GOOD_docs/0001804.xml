 MARIETTA: Ex-youth pastor sentenced to death 
 Submitted by Associated Press Friday, October 21st, 2011, 7:14am 
MARIETTA, Ga. -- A Cobb County jury has sentenced a former youth pastor to death.

Earlier this month, a jury found 33-year-old Joshua Drucker guilty of murder in the 2004 deaths of Andrew Robertson and Lora Nikolova.

The death sentence was issued Thursday.

Lawyers for both sides did not dispute that Drucker pulled the trigger, but prosecutors painted the ex-pastor as a cold-blooded, drug-addicted killer, while the defense team told jurors the killings were an accident and possibly a crime of passion.

Drucker told police he killed Robertson because he had long harbored a grudge against him for giving drugs to Drucker&apos;s sister.

Nikolova&apos;s parents traveled from her native Bulgaria to attend the trial.

 MARIETTA: Jury convicts man of 2 killings 
 Submitted by Associated Press Monday, October 10th, 2011, 6:22pm 
MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) - A Cobb County jury has found Joshua Kevin Drucker guilty of murder in the killings of two people.

The jury deliberated for about 45 minutes on Monday before convicting the 33-year-old Drucker, of McDonough, of malice murder and felony murder in the April 5, 2004, shootings of 40-year-old David Andrew Robertson, and 25-year-old Lora Nikolova.

Drucker was also convicted of armed robbery, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and credit card fraud.

Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty in the sentencing phase of the trial, which could begin Tuesday.

Drucker&apos;s attorneys had asked the jury to convict him on the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter for shooting Robertson and acquit him in the death of Nikolova, which they called an accident.
