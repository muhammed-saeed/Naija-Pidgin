Denton County sheriff’s deputies are
looking for a mentally disabled man who has been missing from his group
assisted-living residence since Monday evening.

According to a sheriff’s report, the
60-year-old man rode away from the home on Stone Rail Drive in the Ponder area
on a three-wheel bicycle. He was last seen at about 8:15 p.m., and authorities
called for assistance after searching for him.

The man has numerous medical problems.
He has been known to start fires and he fears law enforcement officers,
according to the report.



 Other
reports 

 3400
block of East McKinney Street — A man
allegedly helped himself to the cash drawer of a fast-food restaurant Monday
night by reaching in through the window, according to a police report.

An employee was outside in the parking
lot at about 10 p.m. She saw a man pull in and start to get out of his truck.
She told the man the restaurant was closing, and he began to get back into the
truck. She went inside, believing the man was leaving.

She was in the back of the restaurant
with another employee when they heard a crash. They ran back into the front and
discovered the cash register on the floor without the drawer. The drive-through
window had been pulled open.

They saw the silver late-1990s Chevrolet
extended-cab truck pulling away from the restaurant.

 900
block of Dallas Drive — An officer reported Monday night
that he stopped a pickup that had a burned-out headlight and became suspicious
about the actions of the driver and passenger.

The officer noticed an air freshener
hanging from the rear-view mirror and clothes dryer sheets on the floorboard.

He knew that people who smoke controlled
substances are apt to try to conceal the smell with those measures, according
to the report.

Both the driver and passenger were
shaking uncontrollably. The driver was squirming in the seat and could not seem
to sit still, the report states.

After asking them questions, the officer
was more convinced that something was amiss in the truck.

He asked for permission to search the
truck and the driver granted permission.

He reported that he found in the back
floorboard a plastic bag containing a sunglass case with a glass pipe inside.
Also in the bag was a small bag of methamphetamine, the report states. He
arrested the driver on a charge of possession of a controlled substance.

 1000
block of Cordell Street — Someone used the hour that a
woman was taking her dog to a park to burglarize her house, according to a
police report.

The woman said she left about 1:45 p.m.
Monday with the dog. When she returned an hour later, she first noticed that
her back gate was standing open. Then she saw the back door, which had been
locked when she left, had been forced open. The intruder took her computer and
a 32-inch flat-screen television.
